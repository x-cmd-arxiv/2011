J-multiplet of Yb3+ is split by the crystalline electric field (CEF) into a
{\Gamma}7 doublet ground state and a {\Gamma}8 quartet at an excitation energy
20 meV. The magnetic susceptibility can be fit very well by this CEF scheme
under the assumption that a {\Gamma}6 excited state resides at 32 meV; however,
the {\Gamma}8/{\Gamma}6 transition expected at 12 meV was not observed in the
INS. The resistivity follows a Bloch- Gr\""uneisen law shunted by a parallel
resistor, as is typical of systems subject to phonon scattering with no
apparent magnetic scattering. All of these properties can be understood as
representing simple local moment behavior of the trivalent Yb ion. At 1 K,
there is a peak in specific heat that is too broad to represent a magnetic
phase transition, consistent with absence of magnetic reflections in neutron
diffraction. On the other hand, this peak also is too narrow to represent the
Kondo effect in the {\Gamma}7 ground state doublet. On the basis of the
field-dependence of the specific heat, we argue that antiferromagnetic
shortrange order (possibly co-existing with Kondo physics) occurs at low
temperatures. The long-range magnetic order is suppressed because the Yb site

generalize the study by analyzing the interactions of self-interested users in
online communities with finite populations and are not stationary. To optimize
their long-term performance based on their knowledge, users adapt their
strategies to play their best response by solving individual stochastic control
problems. The best-response dynamic introduces a stochastic dynamic process in
the community, in which the strategies of users evolve over time. We then
investigate the long-term evolution of a community, and prove that the
community will converge to stochastically stable equilibria which are stable
against stochastic permutations. Understanding the evolution of a community
provides protocol designers with guidelines for designing social norms in which
no user has incentives to adapt its strategy and deviate from the prescribed
protocol, thereby ensuring that the adopted protocol will enable the community

the $n=2$ result [Buldyrev et. al., Nature, 464, (2010)]. Similar to the ER
NON, for $n=1$ the percolation transition at $p_c$, is of second order while
for any $n>1$ it is of first order. The first order percolation transition in
both ER and RR (for $n>1$) is accompanied by cascading failures between the

is studied from a viewpoint of their compositeness. We analyze the properties

unitary approach, paying attention to the energy dependence of the chiral
interaction. We define the compositeness of a bound state using the field
renormalization constant which is given by the overlap of the bare state and
the physical state in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, or by the residue
of the bound state propagator in the relativistic field theory. The field
renormalization constant enables one to define a normalized quantitative
measure of compositeness of the bound state. Applying this scheme to the chiral
unitary approach, we find that the bound state generated by the
energy-independent interaction is always a purely composite particle, while the
energy-dependent chiral interaction introduces the elementary component,
depending on the value of the cutoff parameter. This feature agrees with the
analysis of the effective interaction by changing the cutoff parameter. A
purely composite bound state can be realized by the chiral interaction only
when the bound state lies at the threshold or when the strength of the two-body
attractive interaction is infinitely large. The natural renormalization scheme,
introduced by the property of the loop function and the matching with the
chiral low-energy theorem, is shown to generate a bound state which is
dominated by the composite structure when the binding energy is small.

dynamics after a quantum quench in quantum impurity models, using the numerical
renormalization group. As shown by Anderson in 1967, the scattering phase
shifts of the single-particle wave functions constituting the Fermi sea have to
adjust in response to the sudden change in the local parameters of the
Hamiltonian, causing the initial and final ground states to be orthogonal. This
so-called Anderson orthogonality catastrophe also influences dynamical
properties, such as spectral functions. Their low-frequency behaviour shows
nontrivial power laws, with exponents that can be understood using a
generalization of simple arguments introduced by Hopfield and others for the
X-ray edge singularity problem. The goal of this work is to formulate these
generalized rules, as well as to numerically illustrate them for quantum
quenches in impurity models involving local interactions. As a simple yet
instructive example, we use the interacting resonant level model as testing
ground for our generalized Hopfield rule. We then analyse a model exhibiting
population switching between two dot levels as a function of gate voltage,
probed by a local Coulomb interaction with an additional lead serving as charge
sensor. We confirm a recent prediction that charge sensing can induce a quantum
phase transition for this system, causing the population switch to become
abrupt. We elucidate the role of Anderson orthogonality for this effect by
explicitly calculating the relevant orthogonality exponents.

information applications is of increasing importance as the complexity of
quantum systems grows. For example, in quantum networks high multi-photon
interference visibility requires properly devised single mode sources. In this
paper we propose a spontaneous parametric down conversion source based on an
integrated cavity-waveguide, where single narrow-band, possibly distinct,
spectral modes for the idler and the signal fields can be generated. This mode
selection takes advantage of the clustering effect, due to the intrinsic
dispersion of the nonlinear material. In combination with a CW laser and fast
detection, our approach provides a means to engineer a source that can
efficiently generate pure photons, without filtering, that is compatible with
long distance quantum communication. Furthermore, it is extremely flexible and
could easily be adapted to a wide variety of wavelengths and applications.

collisional plasma composed of strongly coupled ions and relativistically
degenerate electrons. The equilibrium of ions is maintained by an effective
temperature associated with their strong coupling, whereas that of electrons is
provided by the relativistic degeneracy pressure. Using a multiple scale
technique, a (3+1)-dimensional coupled set of nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger-like
equations with nonlocal nonlinearity is derived from a generalized viscoelastic
hydrodynamic model. These coupled equations, which govern the dynamics of wave
packets, are used to study the oblique modulational instability of a Stoke's
wave train to a small plane wave perturbation. We show that the wave packets,
though stable to the parallel modulation, becomes unstable against oblique
modulations. In contrast to the long-wavelength carrier modes, the wave packets
with short-wavelengths are shown to be stable in the weakly relativistic case,
whereas they can be stable or unstable in the ultra-relativistic limit.
Numerical simulation of the coupled equations reveals that a steady state
solution of the wave amplitude exists together with the formation of a
localized structure in (2+1) dimensions. However, in the (3+1)-dimensional
evolution, a Gaussian wave beam self-focuses after interaction and blows up in
a finite time. The latter is, however, arrested when the dispersion
predominates over the nonlinearities. This occurs when the Coulomb coupling
strength is higher or a choice of obliqueness of modulation, or a wavelength of
excitation is different. Possible application of our results to the interior as
well as in an outer mantle of white dwarfs are discussed.

inspiration from a formal analogy between the equation of self consistency of
the epidemic type aftershock sequences (ETAS) model, and the fractional
differential equation describing the mean value of fractional linear growth
processes, we show some interesting applications of fractional modelling to
study \textit{ab initio} epidemic processes without the assumption of any
empirical distribution. We also show that, in the frame of fractional
modelling, subcritical regimes can be linked to linear fractional death
processes and supercritical regimes to linear fractional birth processes.
Moreover we discuss a simple toy model to underline the possible application of
these stochastic growth models to more general epidemic phenomena such as
tumoral growth.

  Preliminary Report","12 pages, 2 figures, Proceedings of the 25th Workshop on Logic

language parsing. CCG assigns structured lexical categories to words and uses a
small set of combinatory rules to combine these categories to parse a sentence.
In this work we propose and implement a new approach to CCG parsing that relies
on a prominent knowledge representation formalism, answer set programming (ASP)
- a declarative programming paradigm. We formulate the task of CCG parsing as a
planning problem and use an ASP computational tool to compute solutions that
correspond to valid parses. Compared to other approaches, there is no need to
implement a specific parsing algorithm using such a declarative method. Our
approach aims at producing all semantically distinct parse trees for a given
sentence. From this goal, normalization and efficiency issues arise, and we
deal with them by combining and extending existing strategies. We have
implemented a CCG parsing tool kit - AspCcgTk - that uses ASP as its main
computational means. The C&C supertagger can be used as a preprocessor within
AspCcgTk, which allows us to achieve wide-coverage natural language parsing.

The key point of this principle is the separation of the document set into two

of set measures are replaced by subspaces and space measures, we obtain an
alternative theory stemming from Quantum Theory. That theory is named after
vector probability because vectors represent event like sets do in classical

$\omega <T, \omega >T$ and $\omega >> T$. In order to compare, we choose 3+1
dimensional bulk spacetime for the computation of the conductivity. In the
$\omega <T$ range, the conductivity does not show up the Drude like form in any
spacetime dimensions. In the $\omega > T$ range and staying away from the
horizon, for the DBI action with unit dynamical exponent, non-zero magnetic
field and charge density, the conductivity goes as $\omega^{-2/3}$, whereas the
phase of the conductivity, goes as, $ArcTan(Im\sigma^{xx}/Re\sigma^{xx})=\pi/6$
and $ArcTan(Im\sigma^{xy}/Re\sigma^{xy})=-\pi/3$. There exists a universal
quantity at the horizon that is the phase angle of conductivity, which either
vanishes or an integral multiple of $\pi$. Furthermore, we calculate the

is shown here that (in addition to any ion instability) a bump-on-tail which is
unstable appears on the electrons' parallel velocity distribution function

regardless of any non-thermal features on the external electron velocity

peaks near the wake axis. If the mass of the electrons is artificially

more unstable electron distributions arise; but these are caused by the

searches currently implement photo multiplier tubes for signal read-out. In the
last few years PMTs with photocathodes operating down to liquid Argon

Efficiency characteristics. The most recent of these, Hamamatsu Photonics Mod.
R11065 with peak QE up to about 35%, has been extensively tested within the R&D

showed superb performance and allowed obtaining a light yield around 7
phel/keVee in a Liquid Argon detector with a photocathodic coverage in the 12%
range, sufficient for detection of events down to few keVee of energy
deposition. This shows that this new type of PMT is suited for experimental

generators. We describe the main generic features of event generators and how
these are implemented in the HERWIG++ event generator. By applying resummation
techniques, we provide, in chapter 4, analytical calculations of two types of

energy of the QCD initial state radiation (ET), associated with the either
Drell-Yan gauge boson production or Higgs boson production. In both cases we
provide comparisons to results obtained from Monte Carlo event generators. In
chapter 5 we examine two well-motivated models for new physics: one of new
heavy charged vector bosons (W prime) and a model motivated by strong dynamics
electroweak symmetry breaking that contains new resonances, leptoquarks, that
couple primarily to quarks and leptons of the third generation. In the prior
model, we improve the current treatment of the W' by considering interference
effects with the SM W and construct an event generator accurate to
next-to-leading order which we use to conduct a phenomenological analysis. For
the leptoquark model, we provide an implementation in the HERWIG++ event

data is an important exercise in current cosmological research. It involves
finding the global maximum of the likelihood function in the multi-dimensional
parameter space. Currently sampling based methods, which are in general
stochastic in nature, like Markov-Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC), are being commonly
used for parameter estimation. The beauty of stochastic methods is that the
computational cost grows, at the most, linearly in place of exponentially (as
in grid based approaches) with the dimensionality of the search space. MCMC
methods sample the full joint probability distribution (posterior) from which
one and two dimensional probability distributions, best fit (average) values of
parameters and then error bars can be computed. In the present work we
demonstrate the application of another stochastic method, named Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), that is widely used in the field of engineering and
artificial intelligence, for cosmological parameter estimation from WMAP seven
years data. We find that there is a good agreement between the values of the
best fit parameters obtained from PSO and publicly available code COSMOMC.
However, there is a slight disagreement between error bars mainly due to the
fact that errors are computed differently in PSO. Apart from presenting the
results of our exercise, we also discuss the merits of PSO and explain its
usefulness in more extensive search in higher dimensional parameter space.

probabilities. Our next step is to set the probabilities in motion. To do this,
we introduce a canonically conjugate field S and a symplectic structure; this
gives us Hamiltonian equations of motion. We show that it is possible to extend
the metric structure to the full space of the {P,S} and this leads in a natural
way to a Kaehler structure; i.e., a geometry that includes compatible
symplectic, metric and complex structures.
  The simplest geometry that describes these spaces of evolving probabilities
has remarkable properties: the natural, canonical variables are precisely the
wave functions of quantum mechanics; the Hamiltonian for the quantum free
particle can be derived from a representation of the Galilean group using
purely geometrical arguments; and it is straightforward to associate with this
geometry a Hilbert space which turns out to be the Hilbert space of quantum
mechanics. We are led in this way to a reconstruction of quantum theory based

  Programming (WLP 2011)",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  KiCS2 is a new system to compile functional logic programs of the source
language Curry into purely functional Haskell programs. The implementation is
based on the idea to represent the search space as a data structure and logic
variables as operations that generate their values. This has the advantage that
one can apply various, and in particular, complete search strategies to compute
solutions. However, the generation of all values for logic variables might be
inefficient for applications that exploit constraints on partially known
values. To overcome this drawback, we propose new techniques to implement
equational constraints in this framework. In particular, we show how
unification modulo function evaluation and functional patterns can be added
without sacrificing the efficiency of the kernel implementation.

stable holomorphic SU(n) vector bundle $V$ on a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$, the
net amount of chiral matter can be computed by a Chern class computation.
Corresponding computations for the number $N_H$ of Higgses lead for the
phenomenologically relevant cases of GUT group SU(5) or SO(10) to consideration
of the bundle $\La^2 V$. In a class of bundles where everything can be computed
explicitly (spectral bundles on elliptic $X$) we find that the computation for
$N_H$ gives a result which is in conflict with expectations. We argue that this
discrepancy has its origin in the subtle geometry of the spectral data for
$\La^2 V$ and that taking this subtlety into account properly should resolve
the problem.

and the resulting convective patterns are studied in a three-dimensional
Galerkin model. Our study is focused to the conditionally unstable regime of
moist convection in which the stratification is stable for unsaturated air
parcels and unstable for saturated parcels. We perform a comprehensive
statistical analysis of the transition to convection that samples the
dependence of attractors (or fixed points) in the phase space of the model on
the dimensionless parameters. Conditionally unstable convection can be
initiated either from a fully unsaturated linearly stable equilibrium or a
fully saturated linearly unstable equilibrium. Highly localized moist
convection can be found in steady state, in oscillating recharge-discharge
regime or turbulent in dependence on the aspect ratio and the degree of stable
stratification of the unsaturated air. Our phase space analysis predicts
parameter ranges for which self-sustained convective regimes in the case of
subcritical conditional instability can be observed. The observed regime
transitions for moist convection bear some similarities to transitions to
turbulence in simple shear flows.

masses will produce gravitational waves during their merger phase that are
detectable by second-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. In
order to model the gravitational waveform of the merger epoch of compact binary
coalescence, the full Einstein equations must be solved numerically for the
entire mass and spin parameter space. However, this is computationally
expensive. Several models have been proposed to interpolate the results of
numerical relativity simulations. In this paper we propose a numerical
interpolation scheme that stems from the singular value decomposition. This
algorithm shows promise in allowing one to construct arbitrary waveforms within
a certain parameter space given a sufficient density of numerical simulations
covering the same parameter space. We also investigate how similar approaches
could be used to interpolate waveforms in the context of parameter estimation.

cover song identification, i.e. the automatic detection of different audio
renditions of the same underlying musical piece. Until now, this task has been
posed as a typical query-by-example task, where one submits a query song and
the system retrieves a list of possible matches ranked by their similarity to
the query. In this work, we propose a new approach which uses song communities
to provide more relevant answers to a given query. Starting from the output of
a state-of-the-art system, songs are embedded in a complex weighted network
whose links represent similarity (related musical content). Communities inside
the network are then recognized as groups of covers and this information is
used to enhance the results of the system. In particular, we show that this
approach increases both the coherence and the accuracy of the system.
Furthermore, we provide insight into the internal organization of individual
cover song communities, showing that there is a tendency for the original song
to be central within the community. We postulate that the methods and results
presented here could be relevant to other query-by-example tasks.
