($10^{-21}$ s), the heaviest ensembles of interacting nucleons available on
Earth. Such collisions are used to produce super-strong electric fields by the
huge number of interacting protons to test spontaneous positron-electron pair
emission (vacuum decay) predicted by the quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory.
Multi-nucleon transfer in actinide collisions could also be used as an
alternative way to fusion in order to produce neutron-rich heavy and superheavy
elements thanks to inverse quasifission mechanisms. Actinide collisions are
studied in a dynamical quantum microscopic approach. The three-dimensional
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code {\textsc{tdhf3d}} is used with a full
Skyrme energy density functional to investigate the time evolution of
expectation values of one-body operators, such as fragment position and
particle number. This code is also used to compute the dispersion of the
particle numbers (e.g., widths of fragment mass and charge distributions) from
TDHF transfer probabilities, on the one hand, and using the Balian-Veneroni
variational principle, on the other hand. A first application to test QED is
discussed. Collision times in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U are computed to determine the
optimum energy for the observation of the vacuum decay. It is shown that the
initial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction
mechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are
of the order of $\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to
modern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at
$E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair
emission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second
application of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is
discussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific
orientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$)
in the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf.
The collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a
nucleon flux toward the latter. The probability distributions for transfermium
production in such a collision are computed. The produced nuclei are more
neutron-rich than those formed in fusion reactions, thus, leading to more
stable isotopes closer to the predicted superheavy island of stability. In
addition to mass and charge dispersion, the Balian-Veneroni variational
principle is used to compute correlations between $Z$ and $N$ distributions,
which are zero in standard TDHF calculations.

auctions are used, the social welfare can be arbitrarily worse than the

vulnerable populations. If food prices remain high, there is likely to be
persistent and increasing global social disruption. Underlying the food price
peaks we also find an ongoing trend of increasing prices. We extrapolate these

  In this paper we investigate the class of polynomials $f$ whose Newton
polytope $\New(f)$ is a simplex and whose support $A$ contains exactly one
point in the interior of $\New(f)$. Amoebas of polynomials in this class may
have at most one bounded complement component. We provide various results on

establish connections from our bounds to Purbhoo's lopsidedness criterion and
to the theory of $A$-discriminants.

model. We work explicitly the first order perturbation theory and show that
beyond the linear order the dark degeneracy is preserved under some general
assumptions. Then, we construct the dark fluid from a collection of interacting
fluids. Finally, we try to break the degeneracy with a general class of
couplings to baryonic matter. Nonetheless, we show that these interactions can
also be understood in the context of the LCDM model as between dark matter and
baryons. For this last investigation we choose two independent
parameterizations for the interactions, one inspired in electromagnetism and
the other in Chameleon theories. Then, we constrain them with a joint analysis
of CMB and Supernovae observational data.

methods for elliptic equations with multiple scales arising from flows in
porous media. Some of the methods developed using the framework are already
known \cite{jennylt03}; others are new. New insight is gained for the known
methods and extra flexibility is provided by the new methods. We give as an
example a mixed MsFV on uniform mesh in 2-D. This method uses novel multiscale
velocity basis functions that are suited for using global information, which is
often needed to improve the accuracy of the multiscale simulations in the case
of continuum scales with strong non-local features. The method efficiently
captures the small effects on a coarse grid. We analyze the new mixed MsFV and
apply it to solve two-phase flow equations in heterogeneous porous media.
Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
method for modeling the flows in porous media with non-separable and separable
scales.

neutrinos that have traversed a portion of the Moon. Using the approximate
analytic expression of the effective lunar aperture from a recent paper by
Gayley, Mutel and Jaeger, we evaluate the background from cosmic ray
interactions in the lunar regolith. We also consider the modifications to the
effective lunar aperture from generic non-standard model neutrino interactions.
A background to neutrino signals are radio Cherenkov signals from cosmic ray
interactions. For cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, neutrino signals will be
difficult to observe because of low neutrino flux at the high energy end and
large cosmic ray background in the lower energy range considered here. We show
that lunar radio detection of neutrino interactions is best suited to constrain

highly desirable for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. One can quantify
the violation witnessed by an experiment in terms of a statistical p-value,
which can be defined as the maximum probability according to local realism of a
violation at least as high as that witnessed. Thus, high violation corresponds
to small p-value. We propose a prediction-based-ratio (PBR) analysis protocol
whose p-values are valid even if the prepared quantum state varies arbitrarily
and local realistic models can depend on previous measurement settings and
outcomes. It is therefore not subject to the memory loophole [J. Barrett et

time, the p-values are asymptotically optimal. For comparison, we consider
protocols derived from the number of standard deviations of violation of a Bell
inequality and from martingale theory [R. Gill, arXiv:quant-ph/0110137]. We
find that the p-values of the former can be too small and are therefore not
statistically valid, while those derived from the latter are sub-optimal. PBR
p-values do not require a predetermined Bell inequality and can be used to
compare results from different tests of local realism independent of

modern cryptographic tools and paradigms can be used to strengthen, develop and

categorized as : give malware enhanced privacy and be more robust against

threats and attacks that misuse of cryptography can cause when combined with
fraudulent software (viruses, Trojans). Public-key cryptography is very

implications on how the use of cryptographic tools and techniques should be

to investigate the evolution of abundance by comparing local and higher
redshift galaxies. However, the methods used so far have substantial drawbacks

initial mass function derived from the older stellar population of local
elliptical galaxies. Aims. We determine accurate and reliable abundances of C,
N, Ne, and Fe relative to O from the narrow absorption lines observed in the
X-ray spectra of Mrk 509. Methods. We use the stacked 600 ks XMM-Newton RGS and
180 ks Chandra LETGS spectra. Thanks to simultaneous observations with INTEGRAL
and the optical monitor on-board XMM-Newton for the RGS observations and
HST-COS and Swift for the LETGS observations, we have an individual spectral
energy distribution for each dataset. Owing to the excellent quality of the RGS
spectrum, the ionisation structure of the absorbing gas is well constrained,
allowing for a reliable abundance determination using ions over the whole
observed range of ionisation parameters. Results. We find that the relative
abundances are consistent with the proto-solar abundance ratios: C/O =
1.19$\pm$0.08, N/O = 0.98$\pm$0.08, Ne/O = 1.11$\pm$0.10, Mg/O = 0.68$\pm$0.16,

multiplicands and proving that they are a valid dual of the product. Our result
is general enough to apply to a large family of linear programs. This blend of

previously known gaps were only small constant factors or entirely unknown.
Most notably, we show a polynomial separation between linear and non-linear

correction to the Casimir free energy of parallel plates. Roughness is modeled
by specifying a generating functional for correlation functions of the height
profile, the two-point correlation function being characterized by the
variance, \sigma^2, and correlation length, \ell, of the profile. We obtain the
partition function of a massless scalar quantum field interacting with the
height profile of the surface via a \delta-function potential. The partition
function of this model is also given by a holographic reduction to three
coupled scalar fields on a two-dimensional plane. The original
three-dimensional space with a parallel plate at separation 'a' is encoded in
the non-local propagators of the surface fields on its boundary. Feynman rules
for this equivalent 2+1-dimensional model are derived and its counter terms
constructed. The two-loop contribution to the free energy of this model gives
the leading roughness correction. The absolute separation to a rough plate is
measured to an effective plane that is displaced a distance \rho\propto
\sigma^2/\ell from the mean of its profile. This definition of the separation
eliminates corrections to the free energy of order 1/a^4 and results in a
unitary model. We derive an effective low-energy theory in the limit \ell\ll a.
It gives the scattering matrix and effective planar surface of a very rough
plate in terms of the single length scale \rho. The Casimir force on a rough
plate is found to always weaken with decreasing correlation length \ell. The
two-loop approximation to the free energy interpolates between the free energy
of the effective low-energy model and that obtained in proximity force
approximation -- the force on a very rough plate with \sigma\gtrsim 0.5\ell

  The magnetic field configuration includes both a field reversal and a out of

bipolar signatures as a general flag of the presence of a nearby reconnection

DEEP2 Redshift Survey galaxies in the 0.7<z<1.4 redshift range, but our results
are generally applicable to similar optically-selected galaxy samples without
requiring UV or IR data. Using SFRs fit from UV/optical SEDs in the AEGIS
survey, we explore the behavior of restframe B-band magnitude, observed [OII]
luminosity, and restframe (U-B) color with SED-fit SFR for both red sequence
and blue cloud galaxies. We find that a SFR calibration can be calculated for
all z~1 DEEP2 galaxies using a simultaneous fit in M_B and restframe colors
with residual errors that are within the SFR measurement error. The resulting
SFR calibration produces fit residual errors of 0.3 dex RMS scatter for the
full color-independent sample with minimal correlated residual error in L[OII]
or stellar mass. We then compare the calibrated z~1 SFRs to two diagnostics
that use L[OII] as a tracer in local galaxies and correct for dust extinction
at intermediate redshifts through either galaxy B-band luminosity or stellar
mass. We find that a L[OII] - M_B SFR calibration commonly used in the
literature agrees well with our calculated SFRs after correcting for the
average B-band luminosity evolution in L* galaxies. However, we find better
agreement with a local L[OII]-based SFR calibration that includes stellar mass
to correct for reddening effects, indicating that stellar mass is a better

results and show that strong spin relaxation due to extrinsic effects yield an
Si/SiO_2 interfacial spin lifetime of ~ 1ns, orders of magnitude lower than
lifetimes in the bulk Si, whereas relaxation at the top surface plays no
substantial role. Hall effect measurements on ballistically injected electrons
gated in the transport channel yield the carrier mobility directly and suggest
that this reduction in spin lifetime is only partially due to enhanced
interfacial momentum scattering which induces random spin flips as in the
Elliott effect. Therefore, other extrinsic mechanisms such as those caused by
paramagnetic defects should also be considered in order to explain the dramatic
enhancement in spin relaxation at the gate interface over bulk values.

the most widely-separated, weakly bound (2001 QW322, a/Rh~0.22) binary minor
planets known, and also contains the system with lowest-measured mass of any
TNB (2000 CF105, M~1.85E17 kg). Four systems orbit in a prograde sense, and
three in a retrograde sense. They have a different mutual inclination
distribution compared to all other TNBs, preferring low mutual-inclination
orbits. These systems have geometric r-band albedos in the range of 0.09-0.3,
consistent with radiometric albedo estimates for larger solitary
low-inclination Classical Kuiper Belt objects, and we limit the plausible
distribution of albedos in this region of the Kuiper Belt. We find that
gravitational collapse binary formation models produce a similar orbital
distribution to that currently observed, which along with a confluence of other
factors supports formation of the cold Classical Kuiper Belt in situ through
relatively rapid gravitational collapse rather than slow hierarchical
accretion. We show that these binary systems are sensitive to disruption via
collisions, and their existence suggests that the size distribution of TNOs at
small sizes remains relatively shallow.

disc galaxies is the key to understand the formation of this type of galaxies.
The tidal-torque theory tries to explain this acquisition process in a
cosmological framework and predicts positive autocorrelations of
angular-momentum orientation and spiral-arm handedness on distances of 1Mpc/h.
This disc alignment can also cause systematic effects in weak-lensing
measurements. Previous observations claimed discovering such correlations but
did not account for errors in redshift, ellipticity and morphological
classifications. We explain how to rigorously propagate all important errors.
Analysing disc galaxies in the SDSS database, we find that positive
autocorrelations of spiral-arm handedness and angular-momentum orientations on
distances of 1Mpc/h are plausible but not statistically significant. This
result agrees with a simple hypothesis test in the Local Group, where we find
no evidence for disc alignment. Moreover, we demonstrate that ellipticity
estimates based on second moments are strongly biased by galactic bulges,
thereby corrupting correlation estimates and overestimating the impact of disc
alignment on weak-lensing studies. Finally, we discuss the potential of future
sky surveys. We argue that photometric redshifts have too large errors, i.e.,
PanSTARRS and LSST cannot be used. We also discuss potentials and problems of
front-edge classifications of galaxy discs in order to improve estimates of
angular-momentum orientation.

identified as merger candidates, and a cosmologically-averaged `observability'

galaxy mergers using a variety of techniques, T_obs(z) for these techniques
have been poorly constrained. We address this problem by calibrating three
merger rate estimators with a suite of hydrodynamic merger simulations and
three galaxy formation models. We estimate T_obs(z) for (1) close galaxy pairs
with a range of projected separations, (2) the morphology indicator G-M20, and
(3) the morphology indicator asymmetry A. Then we apply these timescales to the
observed merger fractions at z < 1.5 from the recent literature. When our
physically-motivated timescales are adopted, the observed galaxy merger rates
become largely consistent. The remaining differences between the galaxy merger
rates are explained by the differences in the range of mass-ratio measured by
different techniques and differing parent galaxy selection. The major merger
rate per unit co-moving volume for samples selected with constant number
density evolves much more strongly with redshift (~ (1+z)^(+3.0 \pm 1.1)) than
samples selected with constant stellar mass or passively evolving luminosity (~
(1+z)^(+0.1 \pm 0.4)). We calculate the minor merger rate (1:4 <
M_{sat}/M_{primary} <~ 1:10) by subtracting the major merger rate from close
pairs from the `total' merger rate determined by G-M20. The implied minor
merger rate is ~3 times the major merger rate at z ~ 0.7, and shows little

optical/near-infrared (OIR) outbursts that are associated with dramatic
enhancements in the stellar accretion rate. Our intensive X-ray monitoring of
this object affords the opportunity to investigate whether and how the intense
X-ray emission is related to pre-MS accretion activity. Our analysis of all
fourteen Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of V1647 Ori demonstrate that
variations in the X-ray luminosity of V1647 Ori are correlated with similar
changes in the OIR brightness of this source during both (2003-2005 and 2008)
eruptions, strongly supporting the hypothesis that accretion is the primary
generation mechanism for the X-ray outbursts. Furthermore, the Chandra
monitoring demonstrates that the X-ray spectral properties of the second
eruption were strikingly similar to those of the 2003 eruption. We find that
X-ray spectra obtained immediately following the second outburst - during which
V1647 Ori exhibited high X-ray luminosities, high hardness ratios, and strong
X-ray variability - are well modeled as a heavily absorbed (N_H ~ 4x10^22
cm^-2), single-component plasma with characteristic temperatures (kT_X ~ 2-6
keV) that are consistently too high to be generated via accretion shocks but
are in the range expected for plasma heated by magnetic reconnection events. We
also find that the X-ray absorbing column has not changed significantly
throughout the observing campaign. Since the OIR and X-ray changes are
correlated, we hypothesize that these reconnection events either occur in the
accretion stream connecting the circumstellar disk to the star or in
accretion-enhanced protostellar coronal activity.

Given a linear tree network, the variance in the output is a convex function of
the poles of the individual nodes. Cycles create correlations which in turn
increase the variance in the output. Feedforward and feedback have a limited
effect on noise propagation when the respective cycles is sufficiently long.
Crosstalk between the elements of different pathways helps reduce the output
noise, but makes the network slower. Next, we study the differences between
disturbances in the inputs and disturbances in the network parameters, and how
they propagate to the outputs. Finally, we show how noise correlations can

($\kappa^{bal}_{l}$) shows anisotropic variation with changing cross-section
shape and size of the SiNWs. The $C_{v}$ increases with decreasing
cross-section size for all the wires. The triangular wires show the largest
$C_{v}$ due to their highest surface-to-volume ratio. The square wires with

highest number of conducting phonon modes. At the nano-scale a universal
scaling law for both $C_{v}$ and $\kappa^{bal}_{l}$ are obtained with respect

engineering the SiNW cross-section shape, size and orientation open up new ways

explicit time-dependent solutions to the full higher-dimensional field
equations, back-reacting to the presence of a 4D inflaton rolling on a
space-filling codimension-2 source brane. Fluxes in the bulk stabilize all
moduli except the `breathing' modulus (that is generically present in
higher-dimensional supergravities). Back-reaction to the inflaton roll causes
the 4D Einstein-frame on-brane geometry to expand, a(t) ~ t^p, as well as
exciting the breathing mode and causing the two off-brane dimensions to expand,
r(t) ~ t^q. The model evades the general no-go theorems precluding 4D de Sitter
solutions, since adjustments to the brane-localized inflaton potential allow
the power p to be dialed to be arbitrarily large, with the 4D geometry becoming
de Sitter in the limit p -> infinity (in which case q = 0). Slow-roll solutions
give accelerated expansion with p large but finite, and q = 1/2. Because the
extra dimensions expand during inflation, the present-day 6D gravity scale can
be much smaller than it was when primordial fluctuations were generated -
potentially allowing TeV gravity now to be consistent with the much higher
gravity scale required at horizon-exit for observable primordial gravity waves.
Because p >> q, the 4 on-brane dimensions expand more quickly than the 2
off-brane ones, providing a framework for understanding why the observed four
dimensions are presently so much larger than the internal two. If uplifted to a
10D framework with 4 dimensions stabilized, the 6D evolution described here
could describe how two of the six extra dimensions evolve to become much larger
than the others, as a consequence of the enormous expansion of the 4 large
dimensions we can see.

rotation group on this space, the deformation of the Leibnitz rule accompanying
this representation and the implied necessity of deforming the co-product to
restore the rotation symmetry automorphism. This also implies the breaking of
rotational invariance on the level of the Schroedinger action and equation as
well as the Hamiltonian, even for rotational invariant potentials. For
rotational invariant potentials the symmetry breaking results purely from the
deformation in the sense that the commutator of the Hamiltonian and angular
momentum is proportional to the deformation.

ratios among O, Mg, Si, S, and Fe. The northern region has a lower ICM
temperature and higher brightness and Fe abundance, whereas the southern region
has a higher ICM temperature and lower brightness and Fe abundance. These

$\eta (W^2, Q^2) <1$, and as $1/\eta (W^2, Q^2)$ for $\eta (W^2, Q^2) \gg 1$.
Here, $\eta (W^2, Q^2)$ denotes the low-$x$ scaling variable, $\eta (W^2,
Q^2)=(Q^2 + m^2_0) / \Lambda^2_{sat} (W^2)$ with $\Lambda^2_{sat} (W^2)$ being

suggesting the possible need of moving towards more efficient and direct

observe the effects of a flare-induced EIT wave in the corona, and its
subsequent interaction with coronal magnetic loops. In this study, we use these
TRACE observations to corroborate previous theoretical work, as well as
estimate the magnetic field strength and the degree of longitudinal
inhomogeneity. Methods: Loop edges are tracked, both spatially and temporally,
using wavelet modulus maxima algorithms, with corresponding loop displacements
from its quiescent state analysed by fitting scaled sinusoidal functions. The
physical parameters of the coronal loop are subsequently determined using
seismological techniques. RESULTS: The studied coronal loop is found to
oscillate with two distinct periods, 501 +/- 5 s and 274 +/- 7 s, which could
be interpreted as belonging to the fundamental and first harmonic, or could
reflect the stage of an overdriven loop. When assuming the periods belong to
the fundamental kink mode and its first harmonic, we obtain a magnetic field
strength inside the oscillating coronal loop as 2.0 +/- 0.7 G. In contrast,
interpreting the oscillations as a combination of the loop's natural kink
frequency and a harmonious EIT wave provides a magnetic field strength of 5.8
+/- 1.5 G. Using the ratio of the two periods, we find that the gravitational
scale height in the loop is 73 +/- 3 Mm. Conclusions: We show that the
observation of two distinct periods in a coronal loop does not necessarily lead
to a unique conclusion. Multiple plausible scenarios exist, suggesting that
both the derived strength of the magnetic field and the sub-resolution
properties of the coronal loop depend entirely on which interpretation is
chosen.

successive self-consistent cycles; in each cycle a series of coupled equations

when \nr\ has converged to the solution within the required numerical accuracy.
This usually happens after several cycles, resulting in a process calling for
the solution of many sequences of eigenproblems. In this paper, the authors
report evidence showing unexpected correlations between adjacent eigenproblems

undergo an ""evolution"" process. At the same time it is shown that the

impact from a massive central black hole are examined using flat stellar disks.
We construct three disk model groups that consist of exponential disks with one
type of velocity distribution and Kuzmin-Toomre disks with two different types
of exact equilibrium distribution function. For each disk model group, three
disks that have different typical Toomre's Q values are evolved to form bars
through dynamical instability. Once a bar is fully developed, a black hole
(BH), whose mass is 1% of the disk mass, is adiabatically added at the center
of the disk. Our results show that lower-amplitude bars, that is, weaker bars
are dissolved more easily by that BH. We have found that this destructibility
is rooted in the characteristic feature that the bar formed spontaneously
becomes shorter in length and rounder in shape with decreasing bar amplitude.
Since such weaker bars are found to originate from colder disks in each disk
model group, it follows that for a given form of velocity structure, the
coldness of an initial disk determines whether the bar produced in that disk is
favorable to dissolution induced by a massive central BH. In addition, the
existence of bar-dissolved galaxies of the kind studied here is also discussed.

mobile networks are driven by human behaviors. This effect has been
particularly observed in intermittently connected networks like DTN (Delay
Tolerant Networks). Given that common social intentions generate similar human
behavior, it is relevant to exploit this knowledge in the network protocols
design, e.g. to identify the closeness degree between two nodes. In this paper,
we propose a temporal link prediction technique for DTN which quantifies the
behavior similarity between each pair of nodes and makes use of it to predict
future links. Our prediction method keeps track of the spatio-temporal aspects
of nodes behaviors organized as a third-order tensor that aims to records the
evolution of the network topology. After collapsing the tensor information, we
compute the degree of similarity for each pair of nodes using the Katz measure.
This metric gives us an indication on the link occurrence between two nodes
relying on their closeness. We show the efficiency of this method by applying
it on three mobility traces: two real traces and one synthetic trace. Through
several simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique
regarding another approach based on a similarity metric used in DTN. The
validity of this method is proven when the computation of score is made in a
distributed way (i.e. with local information). We attest that the tensor-based
technique is effective for temporal link prediction applied to the
intermittently connected networks. Furthermore, we think that this technique
can go beyond the realm of DTN and we believe this can be further applied on
every case of figure in which there is a need to derive the underlying social
structure of a network of mobile users.

and apply it on preheating and locked inflation. A two-scalar toy model is
analytically solved for the \lambda\phi^2\chi^2 coupling for the homogenous
modes. The effects of dynamic universe background and backreaction are taken
into account. We show the average effect of parametric resonance to be that
\chi's amplitude doubles for each cycle of \phi.
  Our framework partly solves the preheating scenario, showing two distinct
stages of preheating and making the parameters of preheating analytically
calculable. It is demonstrated for slowroll inflation models, preheating is
terminated, if by backreaction, typically in the 5th e-fold. Under our
framework, a possible inhomogeneity amplification effect is also found during
preheating, which both may pose strong constraints on some inflationary models
and may amplify tiny existing inhomogeneities to the desired scale. For
demonstration, we show it rules out the backreaction end of preheating of the

broad-line radio galaxy (BLRG) 3C 111. Its high energy emission shows
variability, a harder continuum with respect to the radio quiet AGN population,
and weak reflection features. Suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;
a comparison with the XMM-Newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 in
the 0.5-10 keV flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. The iron
K complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).
The intensity of the iron K complex does not respond to the change in continuum
flux. An ultra-fast, high-ionization outflowing gas is clearly detected in the
XIS data; the absorber is most likely unstable. Indeed, during the XMM-Newton
observation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. No clear
roll-over in the hard X-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergence
of the jet as a dominant component in the hard X-ray band, as suggested by the
detection above ~ 100 keV with the GSO on-board Suzaku, although the present
data do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of the
different components. The fluxes observed by the gamma-ray satellites CGRO and
Fermi would be compatible with the putative jet component if peaking at
energies E ~ 100 MeV. In the X-ray band, the jet contribution to the continuum
starts to be significant only above 10 keV. If the detection of the jet
component in 3C 111 is confirmed, then its relative importance in the X-ray
energy band could explain the different observed properties in the high-energy
emission of BLRGs, which are otherwise similar in their other multiwavelength
properties. Comparison between X-ray and gamma-ray data taken at different
epochs suggests that the strong variability observed for 3C 111 is probably
driven by a change in the primary continuum.

The aim is to determine the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate
(Macc) of the sources through the analysis of the detected emission features.
We also aim at verifying the reliability and consistency of the existing
empirical relationships connecting emission line luminosity and Lacc. We employ
five tracers (OI-6300A, Ha, CaII-8542A, Pab, and Brg) to derive the accretion
luminosity. The tracers provide Lacc values showing different scatters when
plotted as a function of L*. The Brg seems to be the most reliable, because it
gives the minimum Lacc dispersion over the entire range of L*, whereas the
other tracers provide much more scattered Lacc values, which are not expected
for our homogeneous sample. The comparison between Lacc(Brg) and Lacc obtained
from the other tracers also shows systematic differences among the empirical
relationships. These may probably be ascribed to different excitation
mechanisms contributing to the line emission, which may vary between our sample
and those where the relationships were calibrated. Adopting the Lacc derived
from Brg, we find Lacc=0.1L*-1L* for all sources, and Macc of the order of
10^-7-10^-9 Msun/yr. The Macc derived in ChaI are proportional to M*^2, as
found in other low-mass star-forming regions. The discrepancies observed in the
case of Lacc(Brg) and Lacc(Pab) can be related to different intrinsic Pab/Brg,
ratios. The derived ratios show the existence of two different emission
modalities, one that agrees with predictions of both wind and accretion models,
the other suggesting optically thick emission from relatively small regions

which then reach the Earth after propagating out of the Sun and oscillating
from the production point to the detector. The typical signal which is looked
at refers to the muon neutrino component and consists of a flux of up-going
muons in a neutrino detector. We propose instead a novel signature: the
possibility of looking at the tau neutrino component of the dark matter signal,
which is almost background-free in the downward-going direction, since the tau
neutrino amount in atmospheric neutrinos is negligible and in the down-going
baseline atmospheric muon-neutrinos have no time to sizably oscillate. We
analyze the prospects of studying the downward-going tau neutrinos from dark
matter annihilation (or decay) in the Sun in Cherenkov detectors, by looking at
hadronic showers produced in the charged-current tau neutrino interactions and
subsequent tau decay. We discuss the various sources of background (namely the
small tau neutrino component in atmospheric neutrinos, both from direct
production and from oscillations; tau neutrinos from solar corona interactions;
the galactic tau neutrino component) as well as sources of background due to
misidentification of electron and muon events. We find that the downward-going
tau neutrinos signal has potentially very good prospects for Mton scale
Cherenkov detectors, the main limitation being the level of misidentification
of non-tau events, which need to be kept at level of percent. Several tens of
events per year (depending on the dark matter mass and annihilation/decay
channel) are potentially collectible with a Mton scale detector, and a 5 sigma
significance discovery is potentially reachable for dark matter masses in the
range from 20 to 300 GeV with a few years of exposure on a Mton detector.

structure and exploitation of compressive-measurement structure. For the
latter, we leverage Donoho, Maleki, and Montanari's recently proposed

database suggest that, relative to existing schemes, our turbo LBP approach
yields state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with substantial reduction

dark energy of unknown physical origin. One of the most notable consequences in
many models is that dark energy should cause the expansion of the Universe to
accelerate: but the expansion rate as a function of time has proven very
difficult to measure directly. We present a new determination of the cosmic
expansion history by combining distant supernovae observations with a
geometrical analysis of large-scale galaxy clustering within the WiggleZ Dark
Energy Survey, using the Alcock-Paczynski test to measure the distortion of
standard spheres. Our result constitutes a robust and non-parametric
measurement of the Hubble expansion rate as a function of time, which we
measure with 10-15% precision in four bins within the redshift range 0.1 < z <
0.9. We demonstrate that the cosmic expansion is accelerating, in a manner
independent of the parameterization of the cosmological model (although
assuming cosmic homogeneity in our data analysis). Furthermore, we find that
this expansion history is consistent with a cosmological-constant dark energy.

i.e. global quantities that are conserved in the absence of sources and
dissipative effects, play an important role in various theoretical and
numerical studies of MHD turbulence. The fluxes of these ideal invariants
represent separate channels that transfer the information across different
scales in a turbulent system. Once a statistically stationary state of
turbulence is reached, the amount of any ideal invariant quantity introduced in
the system by a forcing mechanism equals the amount of the same quantity
removed by the dissipative effects from the system. For highly developed
turbulence, these two mechanisms act predominantly at different scales that are
largely separated. Since the ideal invariant quantities cascade between scales,
a constant flux is generated with great implication on the state of the system.
Numerically, controlling the ideal invariant fluxes levels for a turbulent MHD
system is important for the analysis of fundamental MHD turbulence properties.
We propose a forcing mechanism that controls the three ideal invariants of MHD
turbulence: the total energy, the cross-helicity and the magnetic helicity.
This forcing is implemented in the freely available TURBO solver, that is also
briefly presented.

Eridanus. Thanks to high-precision follow-up photometry and spectroscopy
obtained by the telescopes TRAPPIST and Euler, the mass and size of this

1.955096 (+-0.000005) HJD_UTC. The size of the planet is consistent with basic
models of irradiated giant planets. The chromospheric activity (log R'_HK =
-4.67) and rotational period (P_rot = 16.3+-0.5 days) of the host star suggest
an age of 0.8+-0.4 Gy that is discrepant with a stellar-evolution estimate
based on the measured stellar parameters (rho_star = 1.48+-0.10 rho_sun, Teff =
5400+-100 K, [Fe/H]= -0.12+-0.08) which favours an age of 7+-3.5 Gy. This
discrepancy could be explained by the tidal and magnetic influence of the
planet on the star, in good agreement with the observations that stars hosting
hot Jupiters tend to show faster rotation and magnetic activity (Pont 2009;
Hartman 2010). We measure a stellar inclination of 84 (-31,+6) deg,
disfavouring a high stellar obliquity. Thanks to its large irradiation and the
relatively small size of its host star, WASP-50b is a good target for
occultation spectrophotometry, making it able to constrain the relationship
between hot Jupiters' atmospheric thermal profiles and the chromospheric
activity of their host stars proposed by Knutson et al. (2010).

of the closest to us in recent years but heavily obscured by dust, rendering it
unusually faint in the optical, given its proximity. We find that the observed
properties of SN2009hd support its classification as a possible Type II-L SN, a
relatively rare subclass of CC-SNe. High-precision relative astrometry has been
employed to attempt to identify a SN progenitor candidate, based on a
pixel-by-pixel comparison between HST F555W and F814W images of the SN site
prior to explosion and at late times. A progenitor candidate is identified in
the F814W images only; this object is undetected in F555W. Significant
uncertainty exists in the astrometry, such that we cannot definitively identify
this object as the SN progenitor. Via insertion of artificial stars into the
pre-SN HST images, we are able to constrain the progenitor's properties to
those of a possible supergiant, with M(F555W)0>-7.6 mag and (V-I) 0>0.99 mag.
The magnitude and color limits are consistent with a luminous RSG; however,
they also allow for the possibility that the star could have been more yellow
than red. From a comparison with theoretical massive-star evolutionary tracks,
which include rotation and pulsationally enhanced mass loss, we can place a
conservative upper limit on the initial mass for the progenitor of <20 M_sun.
If the actual mass of the progenitor is near the upper range allowed by our
derived mass limit, then it would be consistent with that for the identified
progenitors of the SNII-L 2009kr and the high-luminosity SNII-P 2008cn. The
progenitors of these three SNe may possibly bridge the gap between lower-mass
RSG that explode as SNeII-P and LBV, or more extreme RSG, from which the more
exotic SNeII-n may arise. Very late-time imaging of the SN2009hd site may
provide us with more clues regarding the true nature of its progenitor.
