opposite signs of superconducting order parameter in different bands proposed
for iron-based superconductors (s+- state). We consider proximity effect in a
weakly coupled sandwich composed of a s+- superconductor and thin layer of
s-wave superconductor. In such system the s-wave order parameter is coupled
differently with different s+- gaps and it typically aligns with one of these
gaps. This forces the other s+- gap to be anti-aligned with the s-wave gap. In
such situation the aligned band induces a peak in the s-wave density of states
(DoS), while the anti-aligned band induces a dip. Observation of such
contact-induced negative feature in the s-wave DoS would provide a definite
proof for s+- superconductivity.

rovibrational Hamiltonian have been examined, depending on the level of
truncation of the potential energy operator. It turns out that truncation after
the fifth order in the potential is sufficient to produce vibrational energies
of high accuracy. An interesting feature of the present formulation of the
problem in terms of the curvilinear vibrational coordinates is the explanation
for the l-doubling of the rovibrational levels, which in this picture is
interpreted as the result of the inequivalency of the average rotational
constants in mutually perpendicular planes, rather than as the effect of the

STIS, and COS, we derive an anti- correlation between the stellar temperature
and the high ion velocity shift w.r.t. to the photosphere, with positive (resp.
negative) velocity shifts for the cooler (resp. hotter) white dwarfs. This
trend probably reflects more than a single process, however such a dependence
on the WD's temperature again favors a CS origin for a very large fraction of
those ion absorptions, previously observed with IUE, HST-STIS, HST-GHRS, FUSE,
and now COS, selecting objects for which absorption line radial velocities,
stellar effective temperature and photospheric velocity can be found in the
literature. Interestingly, and gas in near-equilibrium in the star vicinity. It
is also probably significant that the temperature that corresponds to a null
radial velocity, i.e. \simeq 50,000K, also corresponds to the threshold below
which there is a dichotomy between pure or heavy elements atmospheres as well
as some temperature estimates for and a form of balance between radiation
pressure and gravitation. This is consistent with ubiquitous evaporation of
orbiting dusty material. Together with the fact that the fraction of stars with
(red-or blue-) shifted lines and the fraction of stars known to possess heavy
species in their atmosphere are of the same order, such a velocity-temperature
relationship is consistent with quasi-continuous evaporation of orbiting CS
dusty material, followed by accretion and settling down in the photosphere. In
view of these results, ion measurements close to the photospheric or the IS
velocity should be interpreted with caution, especially for stars at
intermediate temperatures. While tracing CS gas, they may be erroneously
attributed to photospheric material or to the ISM, explaining the difficulty of
finding a coherent pattern of the high ions in the local IS 3D distribution.

environment is robustness, ensuring that unmodelled, but bounded, disturbances
have only a proportionally bounded effect upon the behaviours of the system.
Inspired by ideas from robust control and dissipative systems theory, we
present a formal definition of robustness and algorithmic tools for the design
of optimally robust controllers for omega-regular properties on discrete
transition systems. Formally, we define metric automata - automata equipped
with a metric on states - and strategies on metric automata which guarantee
robustness for omega-regular properties. We present fixed point algorithms to
construct optimally robust strategies in polynomial time. In contrast to
strategies computed by classical graph theoretic approaches, the strategies
computed by our algorithm ensure that the behaviours of the controlled system
gracefully degrade under the action of disturbances; the degree of degradation
is parameterized by the magnitude of the disturbance. We show an application of
our theory to the design of controllers that tolerate infinitely many transient
errors provided they occur infrequently enough.

in this mass range in the oldest stars, a high-entropy wind acting in a
core-collapse supernova seems uniquely capable of the twin aspects of a high
molybdenum overproduction confined to a narrow mass range. Whatever the details

legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper, where both the legitimate
user and the eavesdropper have vector Gaussian side information. The aim of the
transmitter is to describe the source to the legitimate user in a way that the
legitimate user can reconstruct the source within a certain distortion level
while the eavesdropper is kept ignorant of the source as much as possible as
measured by the equivocation. We obtain an outer bound for the rate,
equivocation and distortion region of this secure lossy transmission problem.
This outer bound is tight when the transmission rate constraint is removed. In
other words, we obtain the maximum equivocation at the eavesdropper when the
legitimate user needs to reconstruct the source within a fixed distortion level
while there is no constraint on the transmission rate. This characterization of
the maximum equivocation involves two auxiliary random variables. We show that
a non-trivial selection for both random variables may be necessary in general.
The necessity of two auxiliary random variables also implies that, in general,
Wyner-Ziv coding is suboptimal in the presence of an eavesdropper. In addition,
we show that, even when there is no rate constraint on the legitimate link,
uncoded transmission (deterministic or stochastic) is suboptimal; the presence
of an eavesdropper necessitates the use of a coded scheme to attain the maximum
equivocation.

the nature of the quantum critical regime is unclear because of the apparent
breakdown of the concept of the quasiparticle, a cornerstone of existing
theories of strongly interacting metals. Even less is known experimentally
about the formation of ordered phases from such a quantum critical 'soup'.
Here, we report a study of the specific heat across the phase diagram of the

properties are consistent with those of an electronic nematic. We show that
this phase, which exists at low temperatures in a narrow range of magnetic
fields, forms directly from a quantum critical state, and contains more entropy
than mean-field calculations predict. Our results suggest that this extra
entropy is due to remnant degrees of freedom from the highly entropic state

nematic phase, separates two Fermi liquids, neither of which has an
identifiable spontaneously broken symmetry, but which likely differ in the
topology of their Fermi surfaces.

To tackle the problem of huge memory usage associated with de Bruijn
graph-based algorithms, upon which some of the most widely used de novo genome
assemblers have been built, we released SparseAssembler1. SparseAssembler1 can
save as much as 90% memory consumption in comparison with the state-of-art
assemblers, but it requires rounds of denoising to accurately assemble genomes.
In this paper, we introduce a new general model for genome assembly that uses
only sparse k-mers. The new model replaces the idea of the de Bruijn graph from
the beginning, and achieves similar memory efficiency and much better
robustness compared with our previous SparseAssembler1. Results: We demonstrate
that the decomposition of reads of all overlapping k-mers, which is used in
existing de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, is overly cautious. We introduce a
sparse k-mer graph structure for saving sparse k-mers, which greatly reduces
memory space requirements necessary for de novo genome assembly. In contrast
with the de Bruijn graph approach, we devise a simple but powerful strategy,
i.e., finding links between the k-mers in the genome and traversing following
the links, which can be done by saving only a few k-mers. To implement the
strategy, we need to only select some k-mers that may not even be overlapping
ones, and build the links between these k-mers indicated by the reads. We can
traverse through this sparse k-mer graph to build the contigs, and ultimately
complete the genome assembly. Since the new sparse k-mers graph shares almost
all advantages of de Bruijn graph, we are able to adapt a Dijkstra-like
breadth-first search algorithm to circumvent sequencing errors and resolve
polymorphisms.

predict the integrand of the three-loop correlation function up to four

three-loop integrand in the planar limit. We perform an independent check of
this result by verifying that it is consistent with the operator product
expansion, in particular that it correctly reproduces the three-loop anomalous
dimension of the Konishi operator. As a byproduct of our study, we also obtain
the three-point function of two half-BPS operators and one Konishi operator at

(cool) state and are highly substructured. Such initial conditions have been
proposed to explain the level of mass segregation in clusters through dynamics,
and have also been successful in explaining the origin of trapezium-like
systems. In this paper we investigate, using N-body simulations, whether such a
dynamical scenario is consistent with the observed binary properties in the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We find that several different primordial binary
populations are consistent with the overall fraction and separation
distribution of visual binaries in the ONC (in the range 67 - 670 au), and that
these binary systems are heavily processed. The substructured, cool-collapse
scenario requires a primordial binary fraction approaching 100 per cent. We
find that the most important factor in processing the primordial binaries is
the initial level of substructure; a highly substructured cluster processes up
to 20 per cent more systems than a less substructured cluster because of
localised pockets of high stellar density in the substructure. Binaries are
processed in the substructure before the cluster reaches its densest phase,
suggesting that even clusters remaining in virial equilibrium or undergoing
supervirial expansion would dynamically alter their primordial binary
population. Therefore even some expanding associations may not preserve their
primordial binary population.

in particular, imply a mean cluster reddening of E(B-V)=1.45+-0.07 and a
distance of 2.94+-0.12 kpc. The reddening agrees with the UBV results provided
that the local reddening slope is described by E(U-B)/E(B-V)=0.64+-0.01, but
the distance estimates in the 2MASS and UBV systems agree only if the ratio of
total-to-selective extinction for the associated dust is R=Av/E(B-V)=4.0+-0.1.
Both results are similar to what has been obtained for adjacent clusters in the

extinction is widespread through the region, particularly for groups reddened
by relatively nearby dust. Dust associated with the Eta Carinae complex itself
appears to exhibit more `normal' qualities. The results have direct

energy constraint is studied when there is noisy feedback over an orthogonal
additive white Gaussian noise channel. As shown by Pinsker, under the peak
energy constraint, the best error exponent for communicating an M-ary message,
M >= 3, with noise-free feedback is strictly larger than the one without
feedback. This paper extends Pinsker's result and shows that if the noise power
in the feedback link is sufficiently small, the best error exponent for
conmmunicating an M-ary message can be strictly larger than the one without
feedback. The proof involves two feedback coding schemes. One is motivated by a
two-stage noisy feedback coding scheme of Burnashev and Yamamoto for binary
symmetric channels, while the other is a linear noisy feedback coding scheme
that extends Pinsker's noise-free feedback coding scheme. When the feedback
noise power $\alpha$ is sufficiently small, the linear coding scheme
outperforms the two-stage (nonlinear) coding scheme, and is asymptotically

bright very high energy source with an angular extent of ~1 degree and
spatially-resolved spectroscopic TeV measurements. The gamma-ray spectral index
is observed to soften with increasing distance from the pulsar, likely the
result of cooling losses as electrons traverse the nebula. We describe analysis
of X-ray data of the extended nebula, as well as 3-D time-dependent spectral
energy distribution modeling, with emphasis on the spatial variations within
HESS J1825-137. The multi-wavelength data places significant constraints on
electron injection, transport, and cooling within the nebula. The large size
and high nebular energy budget imply a relatively rapid initial pulsar spin
period of 13 \pm 7 ms and an age of 40 \pm 9 kyr. The relative fluxes of each
VHE zone can be explained by advective particle transport with a radially
decreasing velocity profile with $v(r) \propto r^{-0.5}$. The evolution of the
cooling break requires an evolving magnetic field which also decreases radially
from the pulsar, $B(r,t) \propto r^{-0.7} \dot{E}(t)^{1/2}$. Detection of 10
TeV flux ~80 pc from the pulsar requires rapid diffusion of high energy
particles with $\tau_{esc} \approx 90 (R / 10 pc)^2 (E_e/100 TeV)^{-1}$ year,
contrary to the common assumption of toroidal magnetic fields with strong
magnetic confinement. The model predicts a rather uniform Fermi LAT surface
brightness out to ~1 degree from the pulsar, in good agreement with the
recently discovered LAT source centered 0.5 degree southwest of PSR J1826-1334
with extension 0.6 \pm 0.1 degree.

with an off-lattice model of protein folding where fitness is equated with
robustness to misfolding. This model mimics the essential features of the
interactions between amino acids, is consistent with the key paradigms of
protein folding and reproduces the universal distribution of evolutionary rates
among orthologous proteins. We introduce mean path divergence as a quantitative
measure of the degree to which the starting and ending points determine the
path of evolution in fitness landscapes. Global measures of landscape roughness
are good predictors of path divergence in all studied landscapes: the mean path
divergence is greater in smooth landscapes than in rough ones. The
model-derived and experimental landscapes are significantly smoother than
random landscapes and resemble additive landscapes perturbed with moderate
amounts of noise; thus, these landscapes are substantially robust to mutation.
The model landscapes show a deficit of suboptimal peaks even compared with
noisy additive landscapes with similar overall roughness. We suggest that
smoothness and the substantial deficit of peaks in the fitness landscapes of
protein evolution are fundamental consequences of the physics of protein
folding.

dissipation in the atmospheres of hot giant exoplanets. In the limit of weak
thermal ionization, ohmic dissipation increases with the planetary equilibrium
temperature (T_eq >~ 1000 K) faster than the insolation power does, eventually
reaching values >~ 1% of the insolation power, which may be sufficient to
inflate the radii of hot Jupiters. At higher T_eq values still, magnetic drag
rapidly brakes the atmospheric winds, which reduces the associated ohmic
dissipation power. For example, for a planetary field strength B=10G, the
fiducial scaling laws indicate that ohmic dissipation exceeds 1% of the
insolation power over the equilibrium temperature range T_eq ~ 1300-2000 K,
with a peak contribution at T_eq ~ 1600 K. Evidence for magnetically dragged
winds at the planetary thermal photosphere could emerge in the form of reduced
longitudinal offsets for the dayside infrared hotspot. This suggests the
possibility of an anticorrelation between the amount of hotspot offset and the
degree of radius inflation, linking the atmospheric and interior properties of
hot giant exoplanets in an observationally testable way. While providing a
useful framework to explore the magnetic scenario, the scaling laws also reveal

namely, the probability of preparation, the fidelity and purity of the remotely
prepared states. It is shown that our strategy improves these figures compared
with spatial postselection, at the expense of increasing the classical
communication cost as well as the required experimental resources. In addition,
we present a modified version of our strategy for RSP of spatial qudits which
is able to prepare arbitrary pure states, unlike spatial postselection alone.
We expect that our study may also be extended for RSP of the angular spectrum
of a single-photon field as an alternative for quantum teleportation which
requires very inefficient nonlinear interactions.

AGB stars using the GALEX archive, we have discovered a late-M star, Y Gem, to

success of our technique of UV imaging of AGB stars in order to search for
binary companions. Y Gem's large and variable UV flux makes it one of the most
prominent examples of a late AGB star with a mass accreting binary companion.
The UV emission is most likely due to emission associated with accretion
activity and a disk around a main-sequence companion star. The physical
mechanism generating the UV emission is extremely energetic, with an integrated
luminosity of a few L(sun) at its peak. We also find weak CO J=2-1 emission
from Y Gem with a very narrow line profile (FWHM of 3.4 km/s). Such a narrow
line is unlikely to arise in an outflow, and is consistent with emission from
an orbiting, molecular reservoir of radius 300 AU. Y Gem may be the progenitor
of the class of post-AGB stars which are binaries and possess disks but no

Extensions of the standard model are required to account for the burning and
for the expansion of the thermal due to changes in the background

high-resolution three-dimensional numerical simulations, both in a uniform
environment, and in a full-star setting. The simulations in a uniform
environment present compelling agreement with the predicted power-laws and
provide model constants for the full-star model, which then provides excellent
agreement with the full-star simulation. The importance of the different
components in the model are compared, and are all shown to be relevant. An
examination of the effect of initial conditions was then conducted using the
one-dimensional model, which would have been infeasible in three dimensions.
More mass was burned when the ignition kernel was larger and closer to the
center of the star. The turbulent flame speed was found to be important during
the early-time evolution of the thermal, but played a diminished role at later
times when the evolution is dominated by the large-scale hydrodynamics
responsible for entrainment. However, a higher flame speed effectively gave a
larger initial ignition kernel and so resulted in more mass burned. This
suggests that future studies should focus on the early-time behavior of these
thermals (in particular, the transition to turbulence), and that the choice of
turbulent flame speed does not play a significant role in the dynamics once the
thermal has become established.

calculations. A key concept of the LORE method is the introduction of
irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) which are evaluated from the Feynman diagrams
by adopting the Feynman parametrization and
ultraviolet-divergence-preserving(UVDP) parametrization. It is then inevitable
for the ILIs to encounter the divergences in the UVDP parameter space due to
the generic overlapping divergences in the 4-dimensional momentum space. By
computing the so-called $\alpha\beta\gamma$ integrals arising from two loop
Feynman diagrams, we show how to deal with the divergences in the parameter
space with the LORE method. By identifying the divergences in the UVDP
parameter space to those in the subdiagrams, we arrive at the Bjorken-Drell's
analogy between Feynman diagrams and electrical circuits. The UVDP parameters
are shown to correspond to the conductance or resistance in the electrical
circuits, and the divergence in Feynman diagrams is ascribed to the infinite
conductance or zero resistance. In particular, the sets of conditions required
to eliminate the overlapping momentum integrals for obtaining the ILIs are
found to be associated with the conservations of electric voltages, and the
momentum conservations correspond to the conservations of electrical currents,
which are known as the Kirchhoff's laws in the electrical circuits analogy. As
an application to the massive scalar $\phi^4$ theory, it enables us to obtain
the well-known logarithmic running of the coupling constant and the consistent
power-law running of the scalar mass at two loop level. Especially, we present
an explicit demonstration on the general procedure of applying the LORE method

paper also introduces a novel efficient inference algorithm that uses informed

with kinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in

plausible counterparts of the remote dSphs Cetus and Tucana which reside in the

Ionic transport is found to be noticeably hindered by the excessive Coulombic

Lopes and Padua, we show that realistic ionic dynamics can be achieved by the
uniform scaling of electrostatic charges on all interaction sites. The original
model systematically overestimates density and heat of vaporization of RTILs.
Since density linearly depends on charge scaling, it is possible to use it as a
convenient beacon to promptly derive a correct scaling factor. Based on the

conclude that suggested technique is feasible to greatly improve quality of the

of a wreath product plays a very important role in the theory of permutation

in a suitable conjugate of X, the subgroup of Sym(Gamma) induced by a

proposed algorithm achieves superior performance to the classical U-tree
algorithm and the recent active-LZ algorithm, and is competitive with
MC-AIXI-CTW that maintains a bayesian mixture over all context trees up to a
chosen depth.We are encouraged by our ability to compete with this
sophisticated method using an algorithm that simply picks one single model, and
uses Q-learning on the corresponding MDP. Our PhiMDP algorithm is much simpler,

The repetitive threshold r(a) of an a-letter alphabet is the smallest rational
number for which there exists an infinite word whose finite factors have
exponent at most r(a). This notion was introduced in 1972 by Dejean who gave
the exact values of r(a) for every alphabet size a as it has been eventually
proved in 2009.
  The finite-repetition threshold for an a-letter alphabet refines the above
notion. It is the smallest rational number FRt(a) for which there exists an
infinite word whose finite factors have exponent at most FRt(a) and that
contains a finite number of factors with exponent r(a). It is known from
Shallit (2008) that FRt(2)=7/3.
  With each finite-repetition threshold is associated the smallest number of
r(a)-exponent factors that can be found in the corresponding infinite word. It
has been proved by Badkobeh and Crochemore (2010) that this number is 12 for
infinite binary words whose maximal exponent is 7/3.
  We show that FRt(3)=r(3)=7/4 and that the bound is achieved with an infinite
word containing only two 7/4-exponent words, the smallest number.
  Based on deep experiments we conjecture that FRt(4)=r(4)=7/5. The question
remains open for alphabets with more than four letters.

ratio telling how much larger the local alphabet is. We prove that every
regular language is the image of a k-slt language on an alphabet of doubled
size, where the width logarithmically depends on the automaton size, and we
exhibit regular languages for which any smaller alphabetic ratio is
insufficient. More generally, we express the trade-off between alphabetic ratio

digital trees (tries) or binary search trees (bst). The mechanism which
produces symbols of the words (one symbol at each unit time) is called a
source, in information theory contexts. The probabilistic behaviour of the
trees built on words emitted by the same source depends on two factors: the
algorithmic properties of the tree, together with the information-theoretic
properties of the source. Very often, these two factors are considered in a too
simplified way: from the algorithmic point of view, the cost of the Bst is only
measured in terms of the number of comparisons between words --from the
information theoretic point of view, only simple sources (memoryless sources or
Markov chains) are studied.
  We wish to perform here a realistic analysis, and we choose to deal together
with a general source and a realistic cost for data structures: we take into
account comparisons between symbols, and we consider a general model of source,
related to a dynamical system, which is called a dynamical source. Our methods
are close to analytic combinatorics, and our main object of interest is the
generating function of the source Lambda(s), which is here of Dirichlet type.
Such an object transforms probabilistic properties of the source into analytic
properties. The tameness of the source, which is defined through analytic
properties of Lambda(s), appears to be central in the analysis, and is
precisely studied for the class of dynamical sources. We focus here on
arithmetical conditions, of diophantine type, which are sufficient to imply
tameness on a domain with hyperbolic shape.

have shown the need to go beyond entanglement when dealing with mixed states.
Various different measures have sprung up in the literature, for a variety of
reasons, to describe bipartite and multipartite quantum correlations; some are
known under the collective name quantum discord. Yet, in the same sprit as the
criteria for entanglement measures, there is no general mechanism that
determines whether a measure of quantum and classical correlations is a proper
measure of correlations. This is partially due to the fact that the answer is a
bit muddy. In this article we attempt tackle this muddy topic by writing down
several criteria for a ""good"" measure of correlations. We breakup our list into
necessary, reasonable, and debatable conditions. We then proceed to prove
several of these conditions for generalized measures of quantum correlations.
However, not all conditions are met by all measures; we show this via several
examples. The reasonable conditions are related to continuity of correlations,
which has not been previously discussed. Continuity is an important quality if
one wants to probe quantum correlations in the laboratory. We show that most
types of quantum discord are continuous but none are continuous with respect to
the measurement basis used for optimization.

void at (1/4, 3/4, 1/4)a and the other places the void at (0.0, 0.0, 1/2)a. The
first structure is expected to have greater d-p hybridization between Mn and
the Z atom. The other exhibits strong d-d hybridization between the nearest
neighboring transition metal elements. Five XMnZ compounds are considered along
with the previously studied CrMnSb in the second structure, which serves as a
reference. Besides the CrMnSb, only one other alloy, MnMnSi, shows fully
compensated half metallic properties in both structures. Both these alloys obey
the Slater-Pauling electron counting rule for half Hesuler alloys. The
differences between CrMnSb and MnMnSi in the two structures are discussed based

example, can be realized as a canonical collection of cosets of a finite loop.
We show that in the variety of antiautomorphic loops the poset formed by set
inclusion among intersections of left cosets is isomorphic to that formed by
right cosets. We present an algorithm that, given a finite Bol loop $S$, can in

methods (AFEM). We then describe a goal-oriented variation of standard AFEM
(GOAFEM). Following the recent work of Mommer and Stevenson for symmetric
problems, we establish contraction of GOAFEM and convergence in the sense of
the goal function. Our analysis approach is signficantly different from that of
Mommer and Stevenson, combining the recent contraction frameworks developed by
Cascon, Kreuzer, Nochetto and Siebert; by Nochetto, Siebert and Veeser; and by
Holst, Tsogtgerel and Zhu. We include numerical results demonstrating
performance of our method with standard goal-oriented strategies on a

  without Angle Conditions","19 pages, 5 figures. Revision for journal submission",,,,"math.NA math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article we consider a priori error and pointwise estimates for finite
element approximations of solutions to semilinear elliptic boundary value
problems in d>=2 space dimensions, with nonlinearities satisfying critical
growth conditions. It is well-understood how mesh geometry impacts finite
element interpolant quality, and leads to the reasonable notion of shape
regular simplex meshes. It is also well-known how to perform both mesh
generation and simplex subdivision, in arbitrary space dimension, so as to
guarantee the entire hierarchy of nested simplex meshes produced through
subdivision continue to satisfy shape regularity. However, much more
restrictive angle conditions are needed for basic a priori quasi-optimal error
estimates, as well as for a priori pointwise estimates. These angle conditions,
which are particularly difficult to satisfy in three dimensions in any type of
unstructured or adaptive setting, are needed to gain pointwise control of the
nonlinearity through discrete maximum principles. This represents a major gap
in finite element approximation theory for nonlinear problems on unstructured
meshes, and in particular for adaptive methods. In this article, we close this
gap in the case of semilinear problems with critical or sub-critical nonlinear
growth, by deriving a priori estimates directly, without requiring the discrete
maximum principle, and hence eliminating the need for restrictive angle
conditions. Our main result is a type of local Lipschitz property that relies
only on the continuous maximum principle, together with the growth condition.
We also show that under some additional smoothness assumptions, the a priori
error estimate itself is enough to give pointwise control the discrete
solution, without the need for restrictive angle conditions. Numerical
experiments confirm our theoretical conclusions.

for a complete sample of 47 early-type, unbarred galaxies, as a complement to
our previous study of early-type barred galaxies. Following very careful sky
subtraction, the profiles can typically be determined down to brightness levels
well below 27 mag arcsec^{-2} and in the best cases below 28 mag arcsec^{-2}.
We classified the profiles according to the scheme used previously for the
barred sample: Type I profiles are single unbroken exponential radial declines
in brightness; Type II profiles (""truncations"") have an inner shallow slope
(usually exponential) which changes at a well defined break radius to a steeper
exponential; and Type III profiles (""antitruncations"") have an inner
exponential that is steeper, giving way to a shallower outer (usually
exponential) decline.
  By combining these profiles with previous studies, we can make the first
clear statements about the trends of outer-disk profile types along the Hubble
sequence (including both barred and unbarred galaxies), and their global
frequencies. We find that Type I profiles are most frequent in early-type
disks, decreasing from one-third of all S0--Sa disks to barely 10% of the
latest type spirals. Conversely, Type II profiles (truncations) increase in
frequency with Hubble type, from only ~25% of S0 galaxies to ~80% of Sd--Sm
spirals. Overall, the fractions of Type I, II, and III profiles for all disk
galaxies (Hubble types S0--Sm) are: 21%, 50%, and 38%, respectively; this
includes galaxies (~8% of the total) with composite Type II+III profiles
(counted twice).
  Finally, we note the presence of bars in ten galaxies previously classified
(optically) as ""unbarred"". This suggests that ~20% of optically unbarred
galaxies are actually barred; the bars in such cases can be weak, obscured by
dust, or so large as to be mistaken for the main disk

habitable extrasolar planet. Therefore, GL 581 d is used to illustrate a
hypothetical detailed spectroscopic characterization of such planets.
Atmospheric profiles from 1D radiative-convective model scenarios of GL 581 d
were used to calculate high-resolution synthetic spectra. From the spectra,
signal-to-noise ratios were calculated for a telescope such as the planned
James Webb Space Telescope. The presence of the model atmospheres could be
clearly inferred from the calculated synthetic spectra due to strong water and
carbon dioxide absorption bands. Surface temperatures could be inferred for
model scenarios with optically thin spectral windows. Dense, CO2-rich scenarios
did not allow for the characterization of surface temperatures and to assess
habitability. Degeneracies between CO2 concentration and surface pressure
further complicated the interpretation of the calculated spectra, hence the
determination of atmospheric conditions. Still, inferring approximative CO2
concentrations and surface pressures would be possible. In practice, detecting
atmospheric signals is challenging. The SNR for a single transit was only
larger than unity in some near-IR bands for transmission spectroscopy. Most
interestingly, the false-positive detection of biomarker candidates such as
methane and ozone could be possible in low resolution spectra due to the
presence of CO2 absorption bands which overlap with biomarker spectral bands.
This can be avoided however by observing all main CO2 IR bands instead of
concentrating on, e.g., the 4.3 or 15 micron bands only. Furthermore, a masking
of ozone signatures by CO2 absorption bands is shown to be possible.
Simulations imply that such a false-negative detection of ozone would be
possible even for rather large ozone concentrations of up to 1E-5.

assumption is challenged by the growing evidence from optical and X-ray
observations that the total baryon mass fraction increases towards rich
clusters. In this context, we investigate the dependence of stellar, and total
baryon mass fractions as a function of mass. To do so, we used a subsample of
nineteen clusters extracted from the X-ray flux limited sample HIFLUGCS that
have available DR-7 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. From the optical
analysis we derived the stellar masses. Using XMM-Newton we derived the gas
masses. Then, adopting a scaling relation we estimate the total masses. Adding
the gas and the stellar mass fractions we obtain the total baryonic content
that we find to increase with cluster mass, reaching 7-year Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP-7) prediction for clusters with M_500 = 1.6 x 10^{15}
M_sun. We observe a decrease of the stellar mass fraction (from 4.5% to ~1.0%)
with increasing total mass where our findings for the stellar mass fraction
agree with previous studies. This result suggests a difference in the number of
stars formed per unit of halo mass, though with a large scatter for low-mass
systems. That is, the efficiency of star formation varies on cluster scale that
lower mass systems are likely to have higher star formation efficiencies. It
follows immediately that the dependence of the stellar mass fraction on total
mass results in an increase of the mass-to-light ratio from lower to higher
mass systems. We also discuss the consequences of these results in the context

namely, position-restricted substring searching, indexing substrings with gaps,
and indexing substrings with intervals. We obtain the following main results.
{itemize} We give efficient reductions for each of the above problems to a new
problem, which we call \emph{substring range reporting}. Hence, we unify the
previous work by showing that we may restrict our attention to a single problem
rather than studying each of the above problems individually. We show how to
solve substring range reporting with optimal query time and little space.
Combined with our reductions this leads to significantly improved time-space
trade-offs for the above problems. In particular, for each problem we obtain
the first solutions with optimal time query and $O(n\log^{O(1)} n)$ space,
where $n$ is the length of the indexed string. We show that our techniques for
substring range reporting generalize to \emph{substring range counting} and
\emph{substring range emptiness} variants. We also obtain non-trivial
time-space trade-offs for these problems. {itemize} Our bounds for substring
range reporting are based on a novel combination of suffix trees and range
reporting data structures. The reductions are simple and general and may apply
to other combinations of string indexing with range reporting.

present. As a consequence, we show that two distinct resonating scattering
regimes can be accessed depending on the incident photon energy. For

for scalar field theory with quartic interactions. When substituting these

assumption that the emission regions of the considered species coincide, at the
resolution of currently available observations. New SiO observations from APEX

of H$_2$ to constrain shock models. The shock regions associated with targeted
positions in the molecular outflow are studied by means of a 1D code that
generates models of the propagation of stationary shock waves, and
approximations to non-stationary ones. The SiO emission in the inner part of
the outflow is concentrated near the apex of the corresponding bow-shock that
is also seen in the pure rotational transitions of H$_2$. Simultaneous
modelling is possible for H$_2$ and SiO and leads to constraints on the silicon
pre-shock distribution on the grain mantles and/or cores. The best-fitting
models are found to be of the non-stationary type, but the degeneracy of the
solutions is still large. Pre-shock densities of 10$^4$ and 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$

Way is a serious challenge to the concordance cosmological model. Perhaps the
only remaining solution, in this framework, is that the dwarf satellite
galaxies fall into the Milky Way's potential along one or two filaments, which
may or may not plausibly reproduce the observed distribution. Here we test this
scenario by making use of the proper motions of the Fornax, Sculptor, Ursa
Minor and Carina dwarf spheroidals, and trace their orbits back through several
variations of the Milky Way's potential and account for dynamical friction. The
key parameters are the proper motions and total masses of the dwarf galaxies.
Using a simple model we find no tenable set of parameters that can allow Fornax
to be consistent with filamentary infall, mainly because the 1 sigma error on
its proper motion is relatively small. The other three must walk a tightrope
between requiring a small pericentre (less than 20 kpc) to lose enough orbital
energy to dynamical friction and avoiding being tidally disrupted. We then
employed a more realistic model with host halo mass accretion, and found that
the four dwarf galaxies must have fallen in at least 5 Gyrs ago. This time
interval is longer than organised distribution is expected to last before being

estimated the integrated H-band flux originating from the first few AUs of the

the 3-telescope IOTA/IONIC interferometer (Mount Hopkins, Arizona), thorough
modelling of both interferometric data (squared visibility and closure phase)

compact dust disc producing a thermal emission that is largely dominated by
small grains located between 0.1 and 0.3 AU from Vega and accounting for 1.23
+/- 0.45% of the near-infrared stellar flux for our best-fit model. This flux
ratio is shown to vary slightly with the geometry of the model used to fit our

Universe. We use archival GMRT data (obtained for completely different
astronomical goals) to estimate the foregrounds at a redshift ~ 1. The
statistic we use is the cross power spectrum between two frequencies separated
by \Delta{\nu} at the angular multipole l, or equivalently the multi-frequency
angular power spectrum C_l(\Delta{\nu}). An earlier measurement of
C_l(\Delta{\nu}) using this data had revealed the presence of oscillatory
patterns along \Delta{\nu}, which turned out to be a severe impediment for
foreground removal (Ghosh et al. 2011). Using the same data, in this paper we
show that it is possible to considerably reduce these oscillations by
suppressing the sidelobe response of the primary antenna elements. The
suppression works best at the angular multipoles l for which there is a dense
sampling of the u-v plane. For three angular multipoles l = 1405, 1602 and
1876, this sidelobe suppression along with a low order polynomial fitting
completely results in residuals of (\leq 0.02 mK^2), consistent with the noise
at the 3{\sigma} level. Since the polynomial fitting is done after estimation
of the power spectrum it can be ensured that the estimation of the HI signal is
not biased. The corresponding 99% upper limit on the HI signal is xHI b \leq
2.9, where xHI is the mean neutral fraction and b is the bias.

lensing studies to constrain the shape of dark matter haloes, using a
combination of the Millennium dark matter N-body simulation and different
semi-analytic galaxy formation models, as well as simpler Monte Carlo tests.
Since the distribution of galaxy--halo alignments is not known in detail, we
test various alignment models, together with different methods of determining
the halo shape. In addition to alignment, we examine the interplay of halo mass
and shape, and galaxy colour and morphology with the resulting stacked
projected halo shape. We find that only in the case where significant numbers
of galaxy and halo minor axes are parallel does the stacked, projected halo
axis ratio fall below 0.95. When using broader misalignment distributions, such
as those found in recent simulations of galaxy formation, the halo ellipticity
signal is washed out and would be extremely difficult to measure
observationally. It is important to note that the spread in stacked halo axis
ratio due to theoretical unknowns (differences between semi-analytic models,
and between alignment models) are much bigger than any statistical uncertainty:
It is naive to assume that, simply because LCDM predicts aspherical haloes, the
stacked projected shape will be elliptical. In fact, there is no robust LCDM
prediction yet for this procedure, and the interpretation of any such
elliptical halo signal from lensing in terms of physical halo properties will
be extremely difficult.

free energy calculations within the path integral formulation of statistical

dependence of their kinetic energy on the isotope mass. The water simulations
were performed by using the q-TIP4P/F model, a point charge empirical potential
that includes molecular flexibility and anharmonicity in the OH stretch of the
water molecule. The reported melting temperature at ambient pressure of this
model (T = 251 K) increases by 6.5+-0.5 K and 8.2+-0.5 K upon isotopic
substitution of hydrogen by deuterium and tritium, respectively. These
temperature shifts are larger than the experimental ones (3.8 K and 4.5 K,
respectively). In the classical limit, the melting temperature is nearly the
same as that for tritiated ice. This unexpected behavior is rationalized by the
coupling between intermolecular interactions and molecular flexibility. This
coupling makes the kinetic energy of the OH stretching modes larger in the
liquid than in the solid phase. However the opposite behavior is found for
intramolecular modes, which display larger kinetic energy in ice than in liquid
water.

range of 10^{5.5}--10^{6.5} cm^{-3} and ortho-formaldehyde column densities per

Recently, a novel mechanism of bistability termed emergent bistability has been
proposed which involves only positive feedback and no cooperativity in the
regulation. An additional positive feedback loop is effectively generated due
to the inhibition of cellular growth by the synthesized proteins. The
mechanism, demonstrated for a synthetic circuit, may be prevalent in natural
systems also as some recent experimental results appear to suggest. In this
paper, we study the effects of additive and multiplicative noise on the
dynamics governing emergent bistability. The calculational scheme employed is
based on the Langevin and Fokker-Planck formalisms. The steady state
probability distributions of protein levels and the mean first passage times
are computed for different noise strengths and system parameters. In the region
of bistability, the bimodal probability distribution is shown to be a linear
combination of a lognormal and a Gaussian distribution. The variances of the
individual distributions and the relative weights of the distributions are
further calculated for varying noise strengths and system parameters. The
experimental relevance of the model results is also pointed out.

momentum-dependent zero-range interactions in one spatial dimension, which we
call extended hard-sphere Bose gas. The two-body interaction in the latter
model has the advantage of being a regular pseudopotential. The most immediate
consequence is the existence of its Fourier transform, permitting the
formulation of the problem in momentum space, not possible with the original
hard-core interaction. In addition, in the extended system, interactions are
defined in terms of the scattering length, positive or negative, identified
with the hard-sphere diameter only when it is positive. We are then able to
obtain, directly in the thermodynamic limit, the ground state energy of the
strongly repulsive Lieb-Liniger gas and, more importantly, the energy of the
lowest-lying super Tonks-Girardeau gas state with finite, strongly attractive
interactions, in perturbation theory from the novel extended hard-sphere Bose
gas. Tan relations involving the large-momentum behavior of the Lieb-Liniger
gas are also derived, and then applied to the super Tonks-Girardeau gas within

type 1s and type 2s are intrinsically similar and the observed differences
between the two subtypes are solely due to the differing orientations of
toroidal-shaped obscuring material around the AGN. In the framework of the
unification scheme, both the Seyfert subtypes are expected to show similar
intrinsic nuclear properties, such as the absorption-corrected AGN X-ray
luminosity, bolometric luminosity, accretion rate and the mass of the
supermassive black hole. Aims: To test the predictions of the Seyfert
unification scheme, we make statistical comparison of the distributions of: (i)
the absorption-corrected 2.0 - 10 keV X-ray luminosities, (ii) the bolometric
luminosities, (iii) the black hole masses and, (iv) the Eddington ratios, of
Seyfert type 1s and type 2s. Methods: We use an optically selected Seyfert
sample in which type 1s and type 2s are matched in properties that are
independent to the orientation of the obscuring torus, the AGN axis and the
host galaxy. Results: The distributions of the absorption-corrected 2.0 - 10
keV X-ray luminosities, the bolometric luminosities, the black masses and, the
Eddington ratios are statistically similar for the two Seyfert subtypes,
consistent with the orientation and obscuration based Seyfert unification
scheme. The Eddington ratio distributions suggest that both the Seyfert
subtypes are accreting at sub-Eddington level with wide span of Eddington
ratios i.e., 10^-4 - 10^-1.

generally results in unnatural outcomes at low rates. We propose distribution
preserving quantization (DPQ) to solve this problem. DPQ is a new quantization
concept that confines the probability space of the reconstruction to be
identical to that of the source. A distinctive feature of DPQ is that it
facilitates a seamless transition between signal synthesis and quantization. A
theoretical analysis of DPQ leads to a distribution preserving rate-distortion
function (DP-RDF), which serves as a lower bound on the rate of any DPQ scheme,
under a constraint on distortion. In general situations, the DP-RDF approaches
the classic rate-distortion function for the same source and distortion
measure, in the limit of an increasing rate. A practical DPQ scheme based on a
multivariate transformation is also proposed. This scheme asymptotically
achieves the DP-RDF for i.i.d. Gaussian sources and the mean squared error.

nonconvex optimization problem. Solving the nonconvex NUM distributively is a

so-called network MIMO where the TXs share the knowledge of the data symbols to
be transmitted. We introduce a distributed channel state information (DCSI)
model where each TX has its own local estimate of the overall multi-user MIMO
channel and must make a precoding decision solely based on the available local
CSI. We refer to this channel as the DCSI-MIMO channel and the precoding
problem as distributed precoding. We extend to the DCSI setting the work from
Jindal for the conventional MIMO Broadcast Channel (BC) in which the number of
Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) achieved by Zero Forcing (ZF) was derived as a
function of the scaling in the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of
the number of quantizing bits. Particularly, we show the seemingly pessimistic
result that the number of DoFs at each user is limited by the worst CSI across
all users and across all TXs. This is in contrast to the conventional MIMO BC
where the number of DoFs at one user is solely dependent on the quality of the
estimation of his own feedback. Consequently, we provide precoding schemes
improving on the achieved number of DoFs. For the two-user case, the derived
novel precoder achieves a number of DoFs limited by the best CSI accuracy
across the TXs instead of the worst with conventional ZF. We also advocate the
use of hierarchical quantization of the CSI, for which we show that
considerable gains are possible. Finally, we use the previous analysis to
derive the DoFs optimal allocation of the feedback bits to the various TXs
under a constraint on the size of the aggregate feedback in the network, in the
case where conventional ZF is used.

by the YSOs ultraviolet (UV) radiation field especially in the 500-1100 \AA\
spectral range. The two dominant processes are; the photo-dissociation of H_2
molecules in the Werner and Lyman bands, and the emission of photo-electrons
from dust grains when high energy photons are absorbed. Photo-electrons are an
important source of gas heating. Dust grain charging when exposed to various
possible UV fields in the YSOs environment is investigated. Numerical
simulation of the evolution of photo-electrons in the electric field created by
the charged dust grains are carried out to obtain a charging profile. From the
simulations it appears that the different spectra produce significant
quantitative and qualitative different charging processes. Both the UV
background and the Ae-Herbig star radiation field produce a relatively slow
charging of dust grains due to the low fraction of sufficiently energetic
photons. The radiation field of T Tauri Stars (TTSs) is harder due to the
release of magnetic energy in the dense magnetospheric environment. These
numerical results have been used to propose a new simple analytical model for
grain charging in the atmosphere of protostellar disks around TTSs susceptible
to be used in any disk modeling. It has been found that the yield decreases
exponentially with the dust charge and that two populations of photoelectrons
are produced. The high energy population is susceptible of dissociating the H_2
and ionizing some low ionization potential species, such as the Mg. These
results add an additional role to dust on the chemistry of the layers just
below the H_2 photoionization front. This photoelectic yield has been applied
to a simple evaluation of the dust charge in the atmospheres of accretion disks
and a simple evaluation of the dust charge in the atmospheres of accretion
disks.

utilized to tailor electromagnetic fields. The precise spatial arrangement of
such structures can result in surprising optical properties that are not found
in any naturally occurring material. Here, the designed activity emerges from
collective effects of singular components equipped with limited individual
functionality. Top-down fabrication of plasmonic materials with a predesigned
optical response in the visible range by conventional lithographic methods has
remained challenging due to their limited resolution, the complexity of
scaling, and the difficulty to extend these techniques to three-dimensional
architectures. Molecular self-assembly provides an alternative route to create
such materials which is not bound by the above limitations. We demonstrate how
the DNA origami method can be used to produce plasmonic materials with a
tailored optical response at visible wavelengths. Harnessing the assembly power
of 3D DNA origami, we arranged metal nanoparticles with a spatial accuracy of 2
nm into nanoscale helices. The helical structures assemble in solution in a
massively parallel fashion and with near quantitative yields. As a designed
optical response, we generated giant circular dichroism and optical rotary
dispersion in the visible range that originates from the collective
plasmon-plasmon interactions within the nanohelices. We also show that the
optical response can be tuned through the visible spectrum by changing the
composition of the metal nanoparticles. The observed effects are independent of
the direction of the incident light and can be switched by design between left-
and right-handed orientation. Our work demonstrates the production of complex
bulk materials from precisely designed nanoscopic assemblies and highlights the
potential of DNA self-assembly for the fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures.

pressure on dust grains. To find the distribution of radiation pressure, we
numerically solve the 2D radiation transfer problem in a flux limited diffusion
approximation. We iteratively couple the solution with calculations of
stationary 1D models for the wind, and obtain the z-component of the velocity.
Our results demonstrate that for AGN luminosities greater than 0.1 Ledd
external illumination can support a geometrically thick obscuration via
outflows driven by infrared radiation pressure. The terminal velocity of
marginally Compton-thin models (0.2<tau_T<0.6), is comparable to or greater
than the escape velocity. In Compton thick models the maximum value of the
vertical component of the velocity is lower than the escape velocity,
suggesting that a significant part of our torus is in the form of failed wind.
The results demonstrate that obscuration via normal or failed infrared-driven

Such winds can also provide an important channel for AGN feedback.

heterogeneous, Markov-modulated, ON/OFF channels. It is well-known that the
performance of scheduling over fading channels relies heavily on the accuracy
of the available Channel State Information (CSI), which is costly to acquire.
Thus, we consider the CSI acquisition via a practical ARQ-based feedback
mechanism whereby channel states are revealed at the end of only scheduled
users' transmissions. In the assumed presence of temporally-correlated channel
evolutions, the desired scheduler must optimally balance the
exploitation-exploration trade-off, whereby it schedules transmissions both to
exploit those channels with up-to-date CSI and to explore the current state of
those with outdated CSI.
  In earlier works, Whittle's Index Policy had been suggested as a
low-complexity and high-performance solution to this problem. However,
analyzing its performance in the typical scenario of statistically
heterogeneous channel state processes has remained elusive and challenging,
mainly because of the highly-coupled and complex dynamics it possesses. In this
work, we overcome these difficulties to rigorously establish the asymptotic
optimality properties of Whittle's Index Policy in the limiting regime of many
users. More specifically: (1) we prove the local optimality of Whittle's Index
Policy, provided that the initial state of the system is within a certain
neighborhood of a carefully selected state; (2) we then establish the global
optimality of Whittle's Index Policy under a recurrence assumption that is
verified numerically for our problem. These results establish that Whittle's
Index Policy possesses analytically provable optimality characteristics for
scheduling over heterogeneous and temporally-correlated channels.

solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) has exponential or (strongly)
polynomial complexity has attracted much attention in the last 50 years.
Recently, Fearnley proposed an example on which PI needs an exponential number
of iterations to converge. Though, it has been observed that Fearnley's example
leaves open the possibility that PI behaves well in many particular cases, such
as in problems that involve a fixed discount factor, or that are restricted to
deterministic actions. In this paper, we analyze a large class of MDPs and we
argue that PI is efficient in that case. The problems in this class are
obtained when optimizing the PageRank of a particular node in the Markov chain.
They are motivated by several practical applications.
  We show that adding natural constraints to this PageRank Optimization problem
(PRO) makes it equivalent to the problem of optimizing the length of a
stochastic path, which is a widely studied family of MDPs. Finally, we
conjecture that PI runs in a polynomial number of iterations when applied to
PRO. We give numerical arguments as well as the proof of our conjecture in a

Rayleigh-fading channels, the sum information capacity of the system scales as
$\Theta(B \log\log K/B)$ for extended networks, and as $O(B \log\log K)$ and
$\Omega(\log \log K)$ for dense networks. Interpreting these results, we
develop some design principles for the service providers along with some
guidelines for the regulators in order to achieve provisioning of various QoS
guarantees for the end users and, at the same time, maximize revenue for the
service providers.

  arXiv:1109.5355",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analysis of the meteorology of Polar Regions is fundamental to the process of
understanding the global climatology of the Earth and Earth-like planets. The
nature of air circulation in a polar vortex is of preliminary importance. I
have show that the local and continental spatiotemporal relationship between
near surface wind events is self-organized criticality. In particular, the wind
event size, wind event duration, and duration of quiescent wind event are well
approximated by power-law distributions. On a continental scale, the wind
events in the Antarctic tend to be self-organized criticality with ergodic
properties. A similar self-organized criticality wind event was also found in
Taylor Valley located at McMurdo Dry Valleys discovered by Captain Scott's
expedition. Captain Scott's meteorological Terra Nova record was also examined.
I have also revisited and re-analyzed wind events in Hornsund at Spitsbergen
Island, in terms of marginal probabilities and marginal copulas which describe
positive L\'evy process.

  arXiv:1111.2174",,,,"math.GT math.AT math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that all the small covers which are infra-nilmanifolds are exactly
real Bott manifolds. This implies that any small cover which admits a flat
Riemannian metric must be a real Bott manifold. In addition, we will study
small covers which admit Riemannian metrics with positive or nonnegative Ricci
curvature or sectional curvature. We will see that these geometric conditions
put very strong restrictions on the topology of the small covers and the
combinatorial structure of the underlying simple polytopes. Similar geometric
problems are also studied for the real moment-angle complex of an arbitrary
simple polytope.

  Coronal Mass Ejections",,,"10.1088/2041-8205/739/2/L64",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we focus on the analysis of a CME-driven shock observed by
SOHO/LASCO. We show that white-light coronagraphic images can be employed to
estimate the compression ratio X = rho_d / rho_u all along the front of
CME-driven shocks. X increases from the shock flanks (where X ~ 1.2) to the
shock center (where X ~ 3.0 is maximum). From the estimated X values, we infer
the Alfv\'en Mach number for the general case of an oblique shock. It turns out
that only a small region around the shock center is supercritical at earlier
times, while higher up in the corona the whole shock becomes subcritical. This
suggests that CME-driven shocks could be efficient particle accelerators at the
initiation phases of the event, while at later times they progressively loose
energy, also losing their capability to accelerate high energy particles. This
result has important implications on the localization of particle acceleration
sites and in the context of predictive space weather studies.

  Protection Using Poset Decoders",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we explore possibilities for coding when information worlds have
different (semantic) values. We introduce a loss function that expresses the
overall performance of a coding scheme for discrete channels and exchange the
usual goal of minimizing the error probability to that of minimizing the
expected loss. In this environment we explore the possibilities of using
poset-decoders to make a message-wise unequal error protection (UEP), where the
most valuable information is protected by placing in its proximity information
words that differ by small valued information. Similar definitions and results
are shortly presented also for signal constellations in Euclidean space.
