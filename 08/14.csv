the analysis of roll call data. We present a new data-driven model for roll
call voting that is geometric in nature. We construct the model by adapting the
""Partition Decoupling Method,"" an unsupervised learning technique originally
developed for the analysis of families of time series, to produce a multiscale
geometric description of a weighted network associated to a set of roll call
votes. Central to this approach is the quantitative notion of a ""motivation,"" a
cluster-based and learned basis element that serves as a building block in the
representation of roll call data. Motivations enable the formulation of a
quantitative description of ideology and their data-dependent nature makes
possible a quantitative analysis of the evolution of ideological factors. This
approach is generally applicable to roll call data and we apply it in
particular to the historical roll call voting of the U.S. House and Senate.
This methodology provides a mechanism for estimating the dimension of the
underlying action space. We determine that the dominant factors form a low-
(one- or two-) dimensional representation with secondary factors adding
higher-dimensional features. In this way our work supports and extends the
findings of both Poole-Rosenthal and Heckman-Snyder concerning the
dimensionality of the action space. We give a detailed analysis of several
individual Senates and use the AdaBoost technique from statistical learning to
determine those votes with the most powerful discriminatory value. When used as
a predictive model, this geometric view significantly outperforms spatial
models such as the Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE model and the Heckman-Snyder
6-factor model, both in raw accuracy as well as Aggregate Proportional Reduced
Error (APRE).

rate. We first propose a half-duplex decode-forward coding scheme for the
Gaussian relay channel. We then derive three optimal sets of power allocation,
which respectively minimize the network, the relay and the source energy
consumption. These optimal power allocations are given in closed-form, which
have so far remained implicit for maximum-rate schemes. Moreover, analysis
shows that minimizing the network energy consumption at a given rate is not
equivalent to maximizing the rate given energy, since it only covers part of
all rates achievable by decode-forward. We thus combine the optimized schemes
for network and relay energy consumptions into a generalized one, which then
covers all achievable rates. This generalized scheme is not only energy-optimal
for the desired source rate but also rate-optimal for the consumed energy. The
results also give a detailed understanding of the power consumption regimes and
allow a comprehensive description of the optimal message coding and resource
allocation for each desired source rate and channel realization. Finally, we
simulate the proposed schemes in a realistic environment, considering path-loss
and shadowing as modelled in the 3GPP standard. Significant energy gain can be
obtained over both direct and two-hop transmissions, particularly when the
source is far from relay and destination.

  Project No: 9626-58525",,,,"cs.SC cs.CC math.NA math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most famous conjectures in computer algebra is that matrix
multiplication might be feasible in not much more than quadratic time. The best
known exponent is 2.376, due to Coppersmith and Winograd. Many attempts to
solve this problems in the literature work by solving, fixed-size problems and
then apply the solution recursively. This leads to pure combinatorial
optimisation problems with fixed size. These problems are unlikely to be
solvable in polynomial time.
  In 1976 Laderman published a method to multiply two 3x3 matrices using only
23 multiplications. This result is non-commutative, and therefore can be
applied recursively to smaller sub-matrices. In 35 years nobody was able to do
better and it remains an open problem if this can be done with 22
multiplications. We proceed by solving the so called Brent equations [7]. We
have implemented a method to converting this very hard problem to a SAT
problem, and we have attempted to solve it, with our portfolio of some 500 SAT
solvers. With this new method we were able to produce new solutions to the
Laderman's problem. We present a new fully general non-commutative solution
with 23 multiplications and show that this solution is new and is NOT an
equivalent variant of the Laderman's original solution. This result
demonstrates that the space of solutions to Laderman's problem is larger than
expected, and therefore it becomes now more plausible that a solution with 22
multiplications exists. If it exists, we might be able to find it soon just by
running our algorithms longer, or due to further improvements in the SAT solver
algorithms.

implicitly based on a first-order derivative. In this paper we generalise the
elastic net model to an arbitrary quadratic tension term, e.g. derived from a
discretised differential operator, and give an efficient learning algorithm. We
refer to these as generalised elastic nets (GENs). We give a theoretical
analysis of the tension term for 1D nets with periodic boundary conditions, and
show that the model is sensitive to the choice of finite difference scheme that
represents the discretised derivative. We illustrate some of these issues in
the context of cortical map models, by relating the choice of tension term to a
cortical interaction function. In particular, we prove that this interaction
takes the form of a Mexican hat for the original elastic net, and of
progressively more oscillatory Mexican hats for higher-order derivatives. The
results apply not only to generalised elastic nets but also to other methods
using discrete differential penalties, and are expected to be useful in other

Searches undertaken for nearly antipodal pairs of such circles in cosmic

shown that the negative outcome of such searches, if confirmed, should in
principle be sufficient to exclude a detectable non-trivial spatial topology
for most observers in very nearly flat ($0<\mid\Omega_{\text{tot}}-1\mid

that this picture is fundamentally changed if the universe turns out to be {\it

large deviations from antipodicity that have not yet been probed by existing
searches. Here we study under what conditions the detection of a single pair of
circles-in-the-sky can be used to uniquely specify the topology and the
geometry of the spatial section of the Universe. We show that from the
detection of a \emph{single} pair of matching circles one can infer whether the
spatial geometry is flat or not, and if so we show how to determine the
topology (apart from one case) of the Universe using this information. An
important additional outcome of our results is that the dimensionality of the

simulations reveal in all these models a crossover from oscillatory decay of
short-wave perturbations of the temperature field to smooth diffusive decay of
the long-wave perturbations. Such behavior is inconsistent with parabolic
Fourier equation of the heat conduction and clearly demonstrates the necessity
of hyperbolic models. The crossover wavelength decreases with increase of
average temperature. The decay patterns of the temperature field almost do not
depend on the amplitude of the perturbations, so the use of linear evolution
equations for temperature field is justified. In all model investigated, the
relaxation of thermal perturbations is exponential -- contrary to linear chain,
where it follows a power law. However, the most popular lowest-order hyperbolic
generalization of the Fourier law, known as Cattaneo-Vernotte (CV) or telegraph
equation (TE) is not valid for description of the observed behavior of the
models with on-site potential. In part of the models a characteristic
relaxation times exhibit peculiar scaling with respect to the temperature
perturbation wavelength. Quite surprisingly, such behavior is similar to that
of well-known model with divergent heat conduction (Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain) and
rather different from the model with normal heat conduction (chain of
rotators). Thus, the data on the non-stationary heat conduction in the systems
with on-site potential do not fit commonly accepted concept of universality

Among them, middle-aged (> 1E+4 yr) systems exhibit large centre-filled VHE
nebulae, offset from the pulsar position, which result from the complex
relationship between the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium, and reflect
the past evolution of the pulsar. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
(IACTs) have been successful in revealing extended emission from these sources
in the VHE regime. Together with radio and X-ray observations, this
observational window allows one to probe the energetics and magnetic field
inside these large-scale nebulae. H.E.S.S., with its large field of view,
angular resolution of < 0.1deg and unprecedented sensitivity, has been used to
discover a large population of such VHE sources. In this paper, the H.E.S.S.
data from the continuation of the Galactic Plane Survey (-80deg < l < 60deg,
|b| < 3deg), together with the existing multi-wavelength observations, are
used. A new VHE gamma-ray source was discovered at R.A. (J2000) = 13h56m00s,
Dec. (J2000) = -64d30m00s with a 2' statistical error in each coordinate,
namely HESS J1356-645. The source is extended, with an intrinsic Gaussian width
of (0.20 +/- 0.02)deg. Its integrated energy flux between 1 and 10 TeV of 8E-12
erg cm-2 s-1 represents ~ 11% of the Crab Nebula flux in the same energy band.
The energy spectrum between 1 and 20 TeV is well described by a power law dN/dE
~ E-Gamma with photon index Gamma = 2.2 +/- 0.2stat +/- 0.2sys. The inspection
of archival radio images at three frequencies and the analysis of X-ray data
from ROSAT/PSPC and XMM-Newton/MOS reveal the presence of faint non-thermal
diffuse emission coincident with HESS J1356-645. HESS J1356-645 is most likely

have found and rigorously proved that the secrecy rate is non-concave under any

applicable any more. To address this non-concave power allocation problem, we
propose an efficient algorithm. Its gap from optimality vanishes asymptotically

Corrected a few minor errors",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of designing good Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) with low
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding complexity has gathered much attention in the
literature. All the known low ML decoding complexity techniques utilize the
same approach of exploiting either the multigroup decodable or the
fast-decodable (conditionally multigroup decodable) structure of a code. We
refer to this well known technique of decoding STBCs as Conditional ML (CML)
decoding. In this paper we introduce a new framework to construct ML decoders
for STBCs based on the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) and the Factor-graph
based Sum-Product Algorithm. We say that an STBC is fast GDL decodable if the
order of GDL decoding complexity of the code is strictly less than M^l, where l
is the number of independent symbols in the STBC, and M is the constellation
size. We give sufficient conditions for an STBC to admit fast GDL decoding, and
show that both multigroup and conditionally multigroup decodable codes are fast
GDL decodable. For any STBC, whether fast GDL decodable or not, we show that
the GDL decoding complexity is strictly less than the CML decoding complexity.
For instance, for any STBC obtained from Cyclic Division Algebras which is not
multigroup or conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder provides
about 12 times reduction in complexity compared to the CML decoder. Similarly,
for the Golden code, which is conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL
decoder is only half as complex as the CML decoder.

depend on the models of the axiomatic system ZFC. It is known that there are
only three possibilities for the cardinality of the complement of an
omega-language $L(A)$ accepted by a B\""uchi 1-counter automaton $A$. We prove
the following surprising result: there exists a 1-counter B\""uchi automaton $A$
such that the cardinality of the complement $L(A)^-$ of the omega-language
$L(A)$ is not determined by ZFC: (1). There is a model $V_1$ of ZFC in which
$L(A)^-$ is countable. (2). There is a model $V_2$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$ has
cardinal $2^{\aleph_0}$. (3). There is a model $V_3$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$
has cardinal $\aleph_1$ with $\aleph_0<\aleph_1<2^{\aleph_0}$. We prove a very
similar result for the complement of an infinitary rational relation accepted
by a 2-tape B\""uchi automaton $B$. As a corollary, this proves that the
Continuum Hypothesis may be not satisfied for complements of 1-counter
omega-languages and for complements of infinitary rational relations accepted
by 2-tape B\""uchi automata. We infer from the proof of the above results that
basic decision problems about 1-counter omega-languages or infinitary rational
relations are actually located at the third level of the analytical hierarchy.
In particular, the problem to determine whether the complement of a 1-counter
omega-language (respectively, infinitary rational relation) is countable is in
$\Sigma_3^1 \setminus (\Pi_2^1 \cup \Sigma_2^1)$. This is rather surprising if
compared to the fact that it is decidable whether an infinitary rational
relation is countable (respectively, uncountable).

2010jp, also named PTF10aaxi. The light curve exhibits a linear decline with a
relatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactive
decay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003
$M_{\odot}$. Spectra of SN2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peaked
H$\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component that
suggests shock interaction with dense CSM; (2) high-velocity blue and red
emission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wings
extending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. These features persist during 100 days
after explosion. We propose that this line profile indicates a bipolar
jet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal SN ejecta
and CSM interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broad
line wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. Two variations of the jet
interpretation seem plausible: (1) A fast jet mixes 56Ni to high velocities in
polar zones of the H-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jet
produces blue and red bumps in Balmer lines when a jet interacts with dense
CSM. Jet-driven SNeII are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide range
of initial masses above 25 $M_{\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. This seems
consistent with the SN host environment, which is either an extremely
low-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair of
star-forming galaxies. It also seems consistent with the low 56Ni mass that may
accompany black hole formation. We speculate that the jet survives to produce
observable signatures because the star's H envelope was mostly stripped away by
previous eruptive mass loss.

blast wave and dense circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor star.
SN2010jl was the brightest core-collapse SN in 2010, and it was a Type IIn
explosion with strong CSM interaction. Andrews et al. recently reported
evidence for an IR excess in SN2010jl, indicating either new dust formation or
the heating of CSM dust in an IR echo. Here we report multi-epoch spectra of
SN2010jl that reveal the tell-tale signature of new dust formation:
emission-line profiles becoming systematically more blueshifted as the red side
of the line is blocked by increasing extinction. The effect is seen clearly in
the intermediate-width (400--4000 km/s) component of H$\alpha$ beginning
roughly 30d after explosion. Moreover, we present near-IR spectra demonstrating
that the asymmetry in the hydrogen-line profiles is wavelength dependent,
appearing more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. This evidence suggests that
new dust grains had formed quickly in the post-shock shell of SN 2010jl arising
from CSM interaction. Since the observed dust temperature has been attributed
to an IR echo and not to new dust, either (1) IR excess emission at $\lambda <
5 \mu$m is not a particularly sensitive tracer of new dust formation in SNe, or
(2) some assumptions about expected dust temperatures might require further
study. Lastly, we discuss one possible mechanism other than dust that might
lead to increasingly blueshifted line profiles in SNeIIn, although the
wavelength dependence of the asymmetry argues against this hypothesis in the
case of SN2010jl.

minimizing the irreversible entropy production in two ""isothermal"" processes of

form as $\eta_{mP}={\eta_C}/(2-\gamma\eta_C)$ where $\eta_C$ is the Carnot
efficiency while $\gamma$ depends on the heat transfer coefficients between the
working substance and two reservoirs. The value of $\eta_{mP}$ is bounded
between $\eta_{-}\equiv \eta_C/2$ and $\eta_{+}\equiv\eta_C/(2-\eta_C)$. These
results are consistent with those obtained by Chen and Yan [J. Chem. Phys.

the endoreversible assumption happens to hold for Carnot-like heat engines
operating at the maximum power output based on our fundamental assumption, and
that the Carnot-like heat engines that we focused does not strictly satisfy the
low-dissipation assumption, which implies that the low-dissipation assumption
or our fundamental assumption is a sufficient but non-necessary condition for
the validity of $\eta_{mP}={\eta_C}/(2-\gamma\eta_C)$ as well as the existence

This discretization, which is the key to the Asymptotic-Preserving property,
provides a consistent approximation of both the hyperbolic compressible regime

computed via an elliptic equation resulting from a suitable combination of the

Gersten and Nitzan [J. Chem. Phys. 1981, 75, 1139] and Ford and Weber [Phys.
Rep. 1984, 113, 195] is derived for the respective parallel and perpendicular
dipole orientations. Given the distance d of a dipole from a sphere surface of
radius a, the representations comprise four elementary analytic functions and a
modified multipole series taking into account residual multipole contributions.
The analytic functions could be arranged hierarchically according to decreasing
singularity at the short distance limit d ---> 0, ranging from d^{-3} over
d^{-1} to ln (d/a). The alternative representations exhibit drastically
improved convergence properties. On keeping mere residual dipole contribution
of the modified multipole series, the representations agree with the converged
rates on at least 99.9% for all distances, arbitrary particle sizes and
emission wavelengths, and for a broad range of dielectric constants. The
analytic terms of the representations reveal a complex distance dependence and
could be used to interpolate between the familiar d^{-3} short-distance and
d^{-6} long-distance behaviors with an unprecedented accuracy. Therefore, the
representations could be especially useful for the qualitative and quantitative
understanding of the distance behavior of nonradiative rates of fluorophores
and semiconductor quantum dots involving nanometal surface energy transfer in
the presence of metallic nanoparticles or nanoantennas. As a byproduct, a
complete short-distance asymptotic of the quasistatic nonradiative rates is
derived. The above results for the nonradiative rates translate
straightforwardly to the so-called image enhancement factors Delta, which are
of relevance for the surface-enhanced Raman scattering.

  Algorithm",,,,,"math.NA cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Tight-frame, a generalization of orthogonal wavelets, has been used
successfully in various problems in image processing, including inpainting,
impulse noise removal, super-resolution image restoration, etc. Segmentation is
the process of identifying object outlines within images. There are quite a few
efficient algorithms for segmentation that depend on the variational approach
and the partial differential equation (PDE) modeling.
  In this paper, we propose to apply the tight-frame approach to automatically
identify tube-like structures such as blood vessels in Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (MRA) images. Our method iteratively refines a region that encloses
the possible boundary or surface of the vessels. In each iteration, we apply
the tight-frame algorithm to denoise and smooth the possible boundary and
sharpen the region. We prove the convergence of our algorithm. Numerical
experiments on real 2D/3D MRA images demonstrate that our method is very
efficient with convergence usually within a few iterations, and it outperforms
existing PDE and variational methods as it can extract more tubular objects and
fine details in the images.
