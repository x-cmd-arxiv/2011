NLS1 1H0707-495. The delays originate close to the black hole. Here, we show
that RE J1034+396 shows very similar lag properties. At low frequencies (< 1
\times 10-4 Hz), the time lag between energy bands increases with energy
separation, similar to that commonly seen in Galactic black holes and other
AGN. At higher frequencies (~ 3.5 \times 10-4 Hz), the soft (< 1 keV) and hard
(> 3 keV) bands lag behind the intermediate band (1-3 keV). The simplest
interpretation is that the intermediate band is dominated by the direct
power-law continuum, while the soft and hard bands are dominated by the
relativistically-smeared reflected emission. The low frequency delays are
present in both available observations. The high frequency lags are only seen
in one observation. In the observation where high frequency reverberation
delays are observed, the spectrum contains a power-law component and there is a
QPO in the light curve. In the other observation, no power-law component is
required and no QPO is seen. The lags originate a few gravitational radii from
the black hole, and the QPO is associated with the power-law emitting corona.

Detailed analysis of the molecular structure reveals the essential roles of the

because of a blend of ideas and techniques from several seemingly unrelated

branch of mathematics concerning the study of combinatorial properties of
algebraic objects, for instance, Abelian groups, rings, or fields. This
emerging field has seen tremendous advances over the last few years, and has
recently become a focus of attention among both mathematicians and computer
scientists. This fascinating area has been enriched by its formidable links to
combinatorics, number theory, harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, and some other
branches; all deeply cross-fertilize each other, holding great promise for all
of them! In this exposition, we attempt to provide an overview of some
breakthroughs in this field, together with a number of seminal applications to
sundry parts of mathematics and some other disciplines, with emphasis on
computer science and cryptography.

it is equivalent to the Karch-O'Bannon's real-action method. However, it yields
a geometrical insight and technical simplifications. Especially, a real-action

applications of the OSM method, we study several holographic models on the
quantum Hall effect and strange metal. By comparing a Lifshitz background and
the Light-Cone AdS, we show how an extra parameter can change the temperature
scaling behavior of conductivity. Finally we discuss how OSM can be used to

generalizations of the kagome and diamond crystals. The two-dimensional kagome
crystal and its three-dimensional counterpart, the pyrochlore crystal, have
been extensively studied in the context of geometric frustration in
antiferromagnetic materials. Similarly, the polymorphs of elemental carbon
include the diamond crystal and the corresponding two-dimensional honeycomb
structure, adopted by graphene. The kagome crystal in d Euclidean dimensions
consists of vertex-sharing d-dimensional simplices in which all of the points
are topologically equivalent. The d-dimensional generalization of the diamond
crystal can then be obtained from the centroids of each of the simplices, and
we show that this natural construction of the diamond crystal is distinct from
the D_d^+ family of crystals for all dimensions d\neq 3. We analyze the
structural properties of these high-dimensional crystals, including the packing
densities, coordination numbers, void exclusion probability functions, covering
radii, and quantizer errors. Our results demonstrate that the so-called
decorrelation principle, which formally states that unconstrained correlations
vanish in asymptotically high dimensions, remarkably applies to the case of
periodic point patterns with inherent long-range order. We show that the
decorrelation principle is already exhibited in periodic crystals in low
dimensions via a ""smoothed"" pair correlation function obtained by convolution
with a Gaussian kernel. These observations support the universality of the
decorrelation principle for any point pattern in high dimensions, whether
disordered or not. This universal property in turn suggests that the best
conjectural lower bound on the maximal sphere-packing density in high Euclidean
dimensions derived by Torquato and Stillinger [Expt. Math. 15, 307 (2006)] is
in fact optimal.

shown that there is no an isotropy in physical space with respect to gauge
transformations, i.e., given an arbitrary gravitational field, coming from a
gauge transformation in the internal space, physical space reacts differently
in the spatial and temporal components. By making an appropriate choice, we
have found a gauge transformation for the components of tetrad field that
allows a direct analogy with the gauge transformations of the Yang-Mills
theory. In addition, to the asymptotically flat case in which the algebra index
is fixed, we recover the transformations of Electromagnetism. Moreover, still
considering the asymptotically flat case, the dependence of the gauge
transformation parameter in the space-time variables is periodic, just like in
the Electromagnetism. Furthermore, the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic
fields as have recently been defined, make sense since they allow a direct
relation with the momenta, which is analogous to what occurs in other gauge
theories.

particular identify the flows from the Coronet cluster. Near-infrared H2 v=1--0
S(1), 2.12micron-line, narrow-band imaging survey of the R CrA cloud core was
carried out. We identify the best candidate-driving source for each outflow by
comparing the flow properties, available proper motions, and the
known/estimated properties of the driving sources. We also adopted the
thumbrule of outflow power as proportional to source luminosity and inversely
proportional to the source age to reach a consensus.
  Results: Continuum-subtracted, narrow-band images reveal several new
Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Objects (MHOs). Together with previously known
MHOs and Herbig-Haro objects we catalog at least 14 individual flow components
of which 11 appear to be driven by the RCrA aggregate members. The flows
originating in the Coronet cluster have lengths of ~0.1-0.2 pc. Eight out of
nine submillimeter cores mapped in the Coronet cluster region display embedded
stars driving an outflow component. Roughly 80% of the youngest objects in the
Coronet are associated with outflows. The MHO flows to the west of the Coronet
display lobes moving to the west and vice-versa, resulting in nondetections of
the counter lobe in our deep imaging. We speculate that these counterflows may
be experiencing a stunting effect in penetrating the dense central core.
  Conclusions:Although this work has reduced the ambiguities for many flows in
the Coronet region, one of the brightest H2 feature (MHO2014) and a few fainter
features in the region remain unassociated with a clear driving source. The
flows from Coronet, therefore, continue to be interesting targets for future
studies.

to (a) quantify the degree of chemical enrichment in WR nebulae which had

diagnostics. Our high spectral resolution UVES dataset for NGC 3199 allowed the
determination of line broadening temperatures using lines from several
different species. These showed consistent patterns and fair agreement with the
nebular temperatures derived from diagnostic line ratios. Amongst the Galactic
WR nebulae, the nebulae around WR 8, 16 and 40 were found to be strongly
nitrogen-enriched while NGC 3199 displayed abundances which were similar to
those of Galactic H II regions. Amongst the LMC WR nebulae, none displayed an
N/O ratio that significantly exceeded LMC H II region values. The far-red [C I]

indicating that at least part of it was produced by C+ recombination rather
than collisional excitation. The line widths of the [C I] 9824 and 9850A lines

interior through which the DNA molecule is translocated. Using the
nonequilibrium Green functions combined with density functional theory, we
demonstrate that each of the four DNA nucleotides inserted into the nanopore,
whose edge carbon atoms are passivated by either hydrogen or nitrogen, will
lead to a unique change in the device conductance. Unlike other recent
biosensors based on transverse electronic transport through DNA nucleotides,
which utilize small (of the order of pA) tunneling current across a nanogap or
a nanopore yielding a poor signal-to-noise ratio, our device concept relies on
the fact that in ZGNRs local current density is peaked around the edges so that
drilling a nanopore away from the edges will not diminish the conductance.
Inserting a DNA nucleotide into the nanopore affects the charge density in the
surrounding area, thereby modulating edge conduction currents whose magnitude
is of the order of \mu A at bias voltage ~ 0.1 V. The proposed biosensor is not
limited to ZGNRs and it could be realized with other nanowires supporting
transverse edge currents, such as chiral GNRs or wires made of two-dimensional

control coupling to the quantum system for preparation and manipulation as well
as measurement, and for suppressing the uncontrolled coupling giving rise to
low fidelity through static and dynamic effects such as potential corrugations
and noise. As a case study, atom chips for neutral ground state atoms are
analyzed and it is shown that nanofabricated wires will allow for more than
$10^4$ gate operations when considering spin-flips and decoherence. The effects
of fabrication imperfections and the Casimir-Polder force are also analyzed. In

a consequence of demanding Galilean covariance of Schr\""odinger's equation.
However, the usual Galilean transformations inadequately describe the
symmetries of non-relativistic quantum mechanics since they fail to take into
account relativistic time contraction effects which can produce
non-relativistic phases in the wavefunction. In this paper we describe the
incompatibility between Bargmann's rule and Lorentz transformations in the
low-velocities limit, we analyze its classical origin and we show that the

Furthermore, we claim that a proper description of non-relativistic quantum

mechanical perspective. However, in most contexts the preponderance of
molecular dynamics studies utilize classical mechanical models. This paper
treats laser-driven optimal control of molecular dynamics in a classical
framework. We consider the objective of steering a molecular system from an
initial point in phase space to a target point, subject to the dynamic
constraint of Hamilton's equations. The classical control landscape
corresponding to this objective is a functional of the control field, and the
topology of the landscape is analyzed through its gradient and Hessian with
respect to the control. Under specific assumptions on the regularity of the
control fields, the classical control landscape is found to be free of traps
that could hinder reaching the objective. The Hessian associated with an
optimal control field is shown to have finite rank, indicating the presence of
an inherent degree of robustness to control noise. Extensive numerical
simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical principles on a) a
model diatomic molecule, b) two coupled Morse oscillators, and c) a chaotic
system with a coupled quartic oscillator, confirming the absence of traps in
the classical control landscape. We compare the classical formulation with the
mathematically analogous state-to-state transition probability control
landscape of N-level quantum systems. The absence of traps in both
circumstances provides a broader basis to understand the growing number of
successful control experiments with complex molecules, which can have dynamics
that transcend the classical and quantum regimes.

previous simulations on trans-Neptunian Objects and a method that allows us to
obtain the number of craters and the cratering rate on Phoebe. We obtain the
number of craters and the greatest crater on Phoebe produced by Centaurs in the
present configuration of the Solar System. Moreover, we obtain a present
normalized rate of encounters of Centaurs with Saturn of $\dot F = 7.1 \times
10^{-11}$ per year, from which we can infer the current cratering rate on
Phoebe for each crater diameter. Our study and the comparison with the
observations suggest that the main crater features on Phoebe are unlikely to
have been produced in the present configuration of the Solar System and that
they must have been acquired when the SD were depleted in the early Solar
System. If this is what happened and the craters were produced when Phoebe was
a satellite of Saturn, then it had to be captured, very early in the evolution

we focus on the recently discovered Kepler system KOI-54, a face-on binary of
two A stars with $e=0.83$ and an orbital period of 42 days. KOI-54 exhibits
strong ellipsoidal variability during its periastron passage; its lightcurve
also contains ~20 pulsations at perfect harmonics of the orbital frequency, and
another ~10 nonharmonic pulsations. Analysis of such data is a new form of
asteroseismology in which oscillation amplitudes and phases rather than
frequencies contain information that can be mined to constrain stellar
properties. We qualitatively explain the physics of mode excitation and the
range of harmonics expected to be observed. To quantitatively model observed
pulsation spectra, we develop and apply a linear, tidally forced, nonadiabatic
stellar oscillation formalism including the Coriolis force. We produce temporal
power spectra for KOI-54 that are semi-quantitatively consistent with the
observations. Both stars in the KOI-54 system are expected to be rotating
pseudosynchronously, with resonant nonaxisymmetric modes providing a key
contribution to the total torque; such resonances provide a possible
explanation for the two largest-amplitude harmonic pulsations observed in
KOI-54, although we find quantitative problems with this interpretation. We
show in detail that the nonharmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54 can be
produced by nonlinear three-mode coupling. The methods developed in this paper
can be generalized in the future to determine the best-fit stellar parameters
given pulsation data. We also derive an analytic model of KOI-54's ellipsoidal

detector and the detection of the Crab pulsar with the VERITAS array of
Cherenkov telescopes at energies above 100 GeV make it unlikely that curvature
radiation is the main source of photons above GeV energies in the Crab and many
other pulsars. We outline a model in which the broad UV-X-ray component and the
very high energy \gamma-ray emission of pulsars are explained within the
Synchrotron-Self-Compton (SSC) framework. We argue that the bulk of the
observed radiation is generated by the secondary plasma, which is produced in
cascades in the outer gaps of the magnetosphere. We find that the
inverse-Compton (IC) scattering occurs in the Klein-Nishina regime, which
favors synchrotron photons in the UV band as target field for the scattering
process. The primary beam is accelerated in a modest electric field, with a
field strength that is of the order of a few percent of the magnetic field near
the light cylinder. Overall, in the Klein-Nishina regime of the IC scattering
the particle distribution in the gap does not evolve towards a stationary
distribution and thus is intrinsically time-dependent. We point out that in a
radiation reaction-limited regime of particle acceleration the gamma-ray
luminosity L_{\gamma} scales linearly with the pulsar spin-down power \dot{E},
L_\gamma ~ \dot{E}, and not proportional to \sqrt{\dot{E}} as expected from
potential-limited acceleration.

light around brightest cluster galaxies.
  Aims. We study the stellar population of the dynamically hot stellar halo of
NGC 3311, the brightest galaxy in the Hydra I cluster, and that of photometric
substructures in the diffuse light to constrain the origin of these components.
  Methods. We analyze absorption lines in medium-resolution, long-slit spectra
in the wavelength range 4800-5800 angstrom obtained with FORS2 at the Very
Large Telescope. We measure the equivalent width of Lick indices out to 20 kpc
from the center of NGC 3311 and fit them with stellar population models that
account for the [alpha/Fe] overabundance.
  Results. Stars in the dynamically hot halo of NGC 3311 are old (age > 13
Gyr), metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.35), and alpha-enhanced ([alpha/Fe] ~ 0.48).
Together with the high velocity dispersion, these measurements indicate that
the stars in the halo were accreted from the outskirts of other early-type
galaxies, with a possible contribution from dwarf galaxies. We identify a
region in the halo of NGC 3311 associated with a photometric substructure where
the stellar population is even more metal-poor ([Z/H] ~ -0.73). In this region,
our measurements are consistent with a composite stellar population superposed
along the line of sight, consisting of stars from the dynamically hot halo of
NGC 3311 and stars stripped from dwarf galaxies. The latter component
contributes < 28% to the local surface brightness.
  Conclusions. The build-up of diffuse light around NGC 3311 is on-going. Based
on the observed stellar population properties, the dominant part of these stars
may have come from the outskirts of bright early-type galaxies, while stars
from stripped dwarf galaxies are presently being added.

a wide range in luminosity (0.02-4 L*) and extends from the cluster core to
near the virial radius. We find a clear distinction in the observed trends of
the giant and dwarf galaxies. The ages of red-sequence giants are primarily
determined by galaxy mass, with only weak modulation by environment, in the
sense that galaxies at larger cluster-centric distance are slightly younger.
For red-sequence dwarfs (with mass <10^10 Msun), the roles of mass and
environment as predictors of age are reversed: there is little dependence on
mass, but strong trends with projected cluster-centric radius are observed. The
average age of dwarfs at the 2.5 Mpc limit of our sample is approximately half
that of dwarfs near the cluster centre. The gradient in dwarf galaxy ages is a
global cluster-centric trend, and is not driven by the ongoing merger of the
NGC 4839 group to the south west of Coma. We interpret these results using
environmental histories extracted from the Millennium Simulation for members of
massive clusters. Hierarchical cluster assembly naturally leads to trends in
the accretion times of galaxies as a function of projected cluster-centric
radius. On average, simulated galaxies now located in cluster cores joined
halos above any given mass threshold earlier than those now located in the
outskirts of clusters. We test environmental quenching models, in which star
formation is halted in galaxies when they enter halos of a given mass, or
become satellite galaxies. The models broadly reproduce the gradients observed
in Coma, but for dwarf galaxies the efficiency of environmental quenching must
be very high to match the strong trends observed.

We construct a one-dimensional time-dependent model of the binary-disc system,

treatment of the binary potential. We find that the extended accretion disc in
this system is always unstable to the thermal-viscous instability, and
undergoes repeated disc outbursts on ~10-20yr time-scales. This is similar to
the recurrence time-scale of observed outbursts in the RS Oph system, but we
show that the disc's accretion luminosity during outburst is insufficient to
explain the observed outbursts. We explore a range of models, and find that in
most cases the accretion rate during outbursts reaches or exceeds the critical
accretion rate for stable nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface.
Consequently we suggest that a surface nuclear burning triggered by disc
instability may be responsible for the observed outbursts. This allows the
white dwarf mass to grow over time, and we suggest that disc instability in RS
Oph and similar systems may represent a path to Type Ia supernovae.

leading-order shapes, or if the overall bispectrum has large amplitude. Using a
partial-wave expansion of the bispectrum, we suggest a possible origin for the
frequent appearance of this shape. It follows that models with very disparate

of a strong Ly{\alpha} emission line in their spectra. Observational campaigns
have dramatically increased the sample of known LAEs, which now extends out to
z=7. These discoveries have motivated numerous theoretical studies on the
subject, which usually define LAEs in their models based on sharp Ly{\alpha}
luminosity and equivalent width (EW) cuts. While broadly representative, this
procedure does not mimic the selection from observational programs in detail,
which instead use cuts in various colour-spaces. We investigate what
implications this disjoint may have for studies that aim to model LAEs. We
construct an empirical model for the number density of star forming galaxies as
a function of their UV and Ly{\alpha} luminosity, utilising measured
constraints on the luminosity functions (LFs) of drop-out galaxies, and their
luminosity dependent probability distribution function of Ly{\alpha} EW. In
particular, we investigate whether the LAE LFs can be reproduced by defining
LAEs using a (z-dependent) Ly{\alpha} luminosity and EW threshold. While we are
able to reproduce the observed distribution of Ly{\alpha} EW among LAEs out to
restframe EW 200 A, we find that our formalism over-predicts both the UV and
Ly{\alpha} LFs of LAEs by a factor of 2-3, and is inconsistent with
observations at the ~95% level. This tension is partially resolved if we assume
the Ly{\alpha} EW-distribution of drop-out galaxies to be truncated at
restframe EW>150 A. However the overprediction indicates that modeling LAEs
with simple REW and luminosity cuts does not accurately mimic observed
selection criteria, and can lead to uncertainties in the predicted number
density of LAEs. On the other hand, the predicted z-evolution is not affected.
We apply our formalism to drop-out galaxies at z>6, and predict the LFs of LAEs
at z=7-9.

semantic meaning of the sentences as directed by their parsing. The same parser
is used for both. In addition to the inverse lambda-calculus operators, our
system uses a notion of generalization to learn semantic representation of
words from the semantic representation of other words that are of the same

of topological qubits by reducing the mobility of anyons at zero temperature.
Here we compute storage times with and without disorder for quantum chains with
unpaired Majorana fermions - the simplest toy model of a quantum memory.
Disorder takes the form of a random site-dependent chemical potential. The
corresponding one-particle problem is a one-dimensional Anderson model with
disorder in the hopping amplitudes. We focus on the zero-temperature storage of
a qubit encoded in the ground state of the Majorana chain. Storage and
retrieval are modeled by a unitary evolution under the memory Hamiltonian with
an unknown weak perturbation followed by an error-correction step. Assuming
dynamical localization of the one-particle problem, we show that the storage
time grows exponentially with the system size. We give supporting evidence for
the required localization property by estimating Lyapunov exponents of the
one-particle eigenfunctions. We also simulate the storage process for chains
with a few hundred sites. Our numerical results indicate that in the absence of
disorder, the storage time grows only as a logarithm of the system size. We
provide numerical evidence for the beneficial effect of disorder on storage
times and show that suitably chosen pseudorandom potentials can outperform
random ones.

is this type of observational information that is critical for guiding
astrochemical models, as the spatial distribution of molecules and their
relation to energetic sources will govern the chemical mechanisms at play in

feedback delays are jointly considered. Based on this model, the correlation
between the actual and the estimated channel values, \rho, is expressed as a
function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yielding closed-form expressions
for the overall outage probability as a function of \rho. The resulting
diversity order and power gain reveal a high dependence of the performance of
relay selection on the high SNR behavior of \rho, thus shedding light onto the
effect of channel estimation on the overall performance. It is shown that when
the channel estimates are not frequently updated in applications involving
time-varying channels, or when the amount of power allocated for channel
estimation is not sufficiently high, the diversity potential of relay selection
is severely degraded. In short, the main contribution of this paper lies in
answering the following question: How fast should \rho tend to one, as the SNR
tends to infinity, so that relay selection does not experience any diversity
loss?

detected H2O and CH3OH maser emission towards 16 (9%) and 10 (6%) sources with
one new H2O and six new CH3OH maser sources. The detection rates of both masers
rapidly decrease as the central (proto)stars evolve, which is contrary to the
trends in high-mass star-forming regions. This suggests that the excitations of
the two masers are closely related to the evolutionary stage of the central
(proto)stars and the circumstellar environments. H2O maser velocities deviate
on average 9 km s^-1 from the ambient gas velocities whereas CH3OH maser
velocities match quite well with the ambient gas velocities. For both maser
emissions, large velocity differences (|v_{H2O} - v_{sys} | > 10 km s^-1 and
|v_{CH3OH} - v_{sys}| > 1 km s^-1) are mostly confined to Class 0 objects. The
formation and disappearance of H2O masers is frequent and their integrated
intensities change by up to two orders of magnitude. In contrast, CH3OH maser
lines usually show no significant change in intensity, shape, or velocity. This
is consistent with the previous suggestion that H2O maser emission originates
from the base of an outflow while 44 GHz class I CH3OH maser emission arises
from the interaction region of the outflow with the ambient gas. The isotropic
maser luminosities are well correlated with the bolometric luminosities of the

1998. We have carried out astrometric observations of the bursting H$_{2}$O
maser features in Orion KL with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry), a
Japanese VLBI network dedicated for astrometry. The total flux of the bursting
feature at the LSR velocity of 7.58 km s$^{-1}$ reaches 4.4$\times10^{4}$ Jy in
March 2011. The intensity of the bursting feature is three orders of magnitudes
larger than that of the same velocity feature in the quiescent phase in 2006.
Two months later, another new feature appears at the LSR velocity of 6.95 km
s$^{-1}$ in May 2011, separated by 12 mas north of the 7.58 km s$^{-1}$

The bursting masers are elongated along the northwest-southeast direction as
reported in the previous burst in 1998. We determine the absolute positions of
the bursting features for the first time ever with a submilli-arcsecond (mas)

relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic (RRMHD) simulations. As an initial
setting, we assume anti-parallel magnetic fields and a spatially uniform
resistivity. A perturbation imposed on the magnetic fields triggers magnetic
reconnection around a current sheet, and the plasma inflows into the
reconnection region. The inflows are then heated due to ohmic dissipation in
the diffusion region, and finally become relativistically hot outflows. The
outflows are not accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds (i.e., Lorentz factor
~ 1), even when the magnetic energy dominates the thermal and rest mass
energies in the inflow region. Most of the magnetic energy in the inflow region
is converted into the thermal energy of the outflow during the reconnection
process. The energy conversion from magnetic to thermal energy in the diffusion
region results in an increase in the plasma inertia. This prevents the outflows
from being accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds. We find that the
reconnection rate R obeys the scaling relation R S^{-0.5}, where S is the
Lundquist number. This feature is the same as that of non-relativistic
reconnection. Our results are consistent with the theoretical predictions of

localized qubits in curved spacetimes. This research was motivated by a simple
experimental question: if we move a spatially localized qubit, initially in a
state |\psi_1>, along some spacetime path \Gamma from a spacetime point x_1 to
another point x_2, what will the final quantum state |\psi_2> be at point x_2?
This paper addresses this question for two physical realizations of the qubit:
spin of a massive fermion and polarization of a photon. Our starting point is
the Dirac and Maxwell equations that describe respectively the one-particle
states of localized massive fermions and photons. In the WKB limit we show how
one can isolate a two-dimensional quantum state which evolves unitarily along
\Gamma. The quantum states for these two realizations are represented by a
left-handed 2-spinor in the case of massive fermions and a four-component
complex polarization vector in the case of photons. In addition we show how to
obtain from this WKB approach a fully general relativistic description of
gravitationally induced phases. We use this formalism to describe the
gravitational shift in the COW 1975 experiment. In the non-relativistic weak
field limit our result reduces to the standard formula in the original paper.
We provide a concrete physical model for a Stern-Gerlach measurement of spin
and obtain a unique spin operator which can be determined given the orientation
and velocity of the Stern-Gerlach device and velocity of the massive fermion.
Finally, we consider multipartite states and generalize the formalism to
incorporate basic elements from quantum information theory such as quantum
entanglement, quantum teleportation, and identical particles. The resulting
formalism provides a basis for exploring precision quantum measurements of the
gravitational field using techniques from quantum information theory.

phase-resolved spectra. A Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) approach is also
applied to verify results of fitting and estimating in multi parameter models.
The spectra in different rotational phase intervals and light curves in
different energy bands with high S/N ratio show a high complexity. The spectra
can be parameterized with a Gaussian absorption line superimposed on a
blackbody spectrum, while the light curves with double-humped shape show strong
dependence of pulsed fraction upon the energy band (13%-42%), which indicates
that radiation emerges from at least two emitting areas. A model with condensed
iron surface and partially ionized hydrogen thin atmosphere above it allows us
to fit simultaneously the observed general spectral shape and the broad
absorption feature observed at 0.3 keV in different spin phases of RBS 1223. It
allowed to constrain some physical properties of X-ray emitting areas, i.e. the

discrete classical symmetries play an important role in fundamental physics.
Examples come from chiral anomalies in the Standard Model of fundamental
interactions and gravitational anomalies in string theories. Their generic
origin is the fact that classical symmetries may not preserve the domains of
quantum operators like the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show by simple
examples that anomalous symmetries can often be implemented at the expense of
working with mixed states having non-zero entropies. In particular there is the
result on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be
rectified by using impure states. We also argue that non-abelian groups of
twisted bundles are always anomalous for pure states sharpening an earlier
argument of Sorkin and Balachandran. This is the case of mapping class groups
of geons indicating that ""large"" diffeos are anomalous for pure states in the
presence of geons. Nevertheless diffeo invariance may be restored by using
impure states. This work concludes with examples of these ideas drawn from
molecular physics.
  The above approach using impure states is entirely equivalent to restricting
all states to the algebra of observables invariant under the anomalous
symmetries. For anomalous gauge groups such as color, this would mean that we
work with observables singlet under global gauge transformations. For color,
this will mean that we work with color singlets, a reasonable constraint.

clouds towards star formation regions. Thus, the aim of the study was to
identify H2CO distributions in ambient molecular clouds. We investigated
morphologic relations among 6-cm continuum brightness temperature (CBT) data
and H2CO (111-110; Nanshan 25-m radio telescope), 12CO (1--0; 1.2-m CfA
telescope) and midcourse space experiment (MSX) data, and considered the impact
of background components on foreground clouds. We report simultaneous 6-cm H2CO
absorption lines and H110\alpha radio recombination line observations and give
several large-area mappings at 4.8 GHz toward W49 (50'\times50'), W3
(70'\times90'), DR21/W75 (60'\times90') and NGC2024/NGC2023 (50'\times100')
GMCs. By superimposing H2CO and 12CO contours onto the MSX color map, we can
compare correlations. The resolution for H2CO, 12CO and MSX data was about 10',
8' and 18.3"", respectively. Comparison of H2CO and 12CO contours, 8.28-\mu m
MSX colorscale and CBT data revealed great morphological correlation in the
large area, although there are some discrepancies between 12CO and H2CO peaks
in small areas. The NGC2024/NGC2023 GMC is a large area of HII regions with a
high CBT, but a H2CO cloud to the north is possible against the cosmic
microwave background. A statistical diagram shows that 85.21% of H2CO
absorption lines are distributed in the intensity range from -1.0 to 0 Jy and
the \Delta V range from 1.206 to 5 km/s.

areas of science. Much of these data are quantitative image data, which are
characterized by intensities that represent some measurement of interest in the
scanned images. The data typically consist of multiple images on the same
domain and the goal of the research is to combine the quantitative information
across images to make inference about populations or interventions. In this
paper we present a unified analysis framework for the analysis of quantitative
image data using a Bayesian functional mixed model approach. This framework is
flexible enough to handle complex, irregular images with many local features,
and can model the simultaneous effects of multiple factors on the image
intensities and account for the correlation between images induced by the
design. We introduce a general isomorphic modeling approach to fitting the
functional mixed model, of which the wavelet-based functional mixed model is
one special case. With suitable modeling choices, this approach leads to
efficient calculations and can result in flexible modeling and adaptive
smoothing of the salient features in the data. The proposed method has the
following advantages: it can be run automatically, it produces inferential
plots indicating which regions of the image are associated with each factor, it
simultaneously considers the practical and statistical significance of
findings, and it controls the false discovery rate.

we have determined the luminosity functions (LFs) at rest-frame wavelengths of
100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z>1, for bright sub-mm galaxies
with star formation rates (SFR) >100 M_sun/yr. We find that the evolution of
the comoving LF is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. From
the LFs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,
we derived an average relation between SFR and halo mass (and its scatter). We
also infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded star
formation in massive halos (M_H>3*10^12 M_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. Given the
SFRs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 M_sun/yr, this timescale implies final
stellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 M_sun. The corresponding stellar mass
function matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies at
z>1. The comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and UV selected galaxies
suggests that the dust-free, UV bright phase, is >10^2 times shorter than the
sub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset of
star formation. Using a single reference Spectral Energy Distribution (SED; the
one of the z~2.3 galaxy SMM J2135-0102), our simple physical model is able to
reproduce not only the LFs at different redshifts > 1 but also the counts at
wavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. Owing to the steepness of the
counts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests that
the dispersion of sub-mm SEDs of z>1 galaxies around the reference one is
rather small.

together for sophisticated analytics and mash-up applications are emerging
trends, and are prerequisites for grand visions such as that of cyber-physical
systems enabled smart cities. Cloud infrastructure can enable such data sharing
both because it can scale easily to an arbitrary volume of data and computation
needs on demand, as well as because of natural collocation of diverse such data
sets within the infrastructure. However, in order to convince data owners that
their data are well protected while being shared among cloud users, the cloud
platform needs to provide flexible mechanisms for the users to express the
constraints (access rules) subject to which the data should be shared, and
likewise, enforce them effectively. We study a comprehensive set of practical
scenarios where data sharing needs to be enforced by methods such as
aggregation, windowed frame, value constrains, etc., and observe that existing
basic access control mechanisms do not provide adequate flexibility to enable
effective data sharing in a secure and controlled manner. In this paper, we
thus propose a framework for cloud that extends popular XACML model
significantly by integrating flexible access control decisions and data access
in a seamless fashion. We have prototyped the framework and deployed it on
commercial cloud environment for experimental runs to test the efficacy of our
approach and evaluate the performance of the implemented prototype.

considering expectation values of products of observables only. A new set of
nontrivial no-signaling inequalities is derived which have a remarkably close

this paper, we study the parameter space of ICS model for 15 pulsars, which
share the common pulse profile evolution phenomena that the pulse profiles are
narrower at higher observing frequencies. Two key parameters, the initial
Lorentz factor and the energy loss factor of secondary particles are
constrained using the least square fitting method, where we fit the theoretical

widths at multiple frequencies. The uncertainty of the inclination and viewing

initial Lorentz factor is larger than 4000, and the energy loss factor is
between 20 and 560. The Lorentz factor is consistent with the prediction of the
inner vacuum gap model. Such high energy loss factors suggest significant
energy loss for secondary particles at altitudes of a few tens to hundreds of

The previously unstudied central star is found to be a binary consisting of a
G8IV-V secondary at optical wavelengths and a hot white dwarf (WD) at UV
wavelengths. The secondary shows Ba II and Sr II features enhanced for its
spectral type that, combined with the chromospheric Halpha emission and
possible 20-30 km/s radial velocity amplitude, firmly classifies the binary as
a Barium star. The proposed origin of Barium stars is intimately linked to PNe
whereby wind accretion pollutes the companion with dredged-up material rich in
carbon and s-process elements when the primary is experiencing thermal pulses
on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). A 70 provides further evidence for this
scenario together with the other very few examples of Barium central stars. The
nebula is found to have Type-I chemical abundances with helium and nitrogen
enrichment, which when combined with future abundance studies of the central
star, will establish A 70 as a unique laboratory for studying s-process AGB
nucleosynthesis. We also discuss guidelines to discover more binary central

polyacrylamide in a high viscosity water-sugar solvent. Detailed studies of the
average and rms velocity and velocity gradients profiles reveal an emergence of
the boundary layer associated with the nonuniform distribution of the elastic
stresses across the channel. The characteristic boundary width is independent
of the Weissenberg number Wi and proportional to the channel width that follows
from our early investigations of the boundary layer in elastic turbulence of
different flow geometries. The appearance of the characteristic spatial scales
of the order of the boundary layer width of both velocity and velocity gradient
in the correlation functions of the velocity and velocity gradient fields in a
bulk flow suggests that rare and strong parcels of excessive elastic stresses,
concentrated in the boundary layer, are ejected into the bulk flow similar to
jets observed in passive scalar mixing. And finally, the experimental results
show that one of the main predictions of the theory of elastic turbulence,
namely the saturation of the normalized rms velocity gradient in the bulk flow
of elastic turbulence contradicts to the experimental observations both
qualitatively and quantitatively in spite of the fact that the theory explains
well the observed sharp decay of the velocity power spectrum. The experimental
findings call for further development of theory of elastic turbulence in a

We discuss possible sources of depletion of asymmetry in the DM and visible

of triplet scalars. A Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain analysis is performed for the
whole parameter space. The survival of the asymmetry in the dark sector leads
to inelastic scattering off nuclei. We then apply bayesian statistic to infer
the model parameters favoured by the current experimental data, in particular
the DAMA annual modulation and Xenon100 exclusion limit. The latter strongly
disfavours asymmetric scalar doublet DM of mass $\mathcal{O}(\TeV)$ as required
by DM-$\bar{\rm DM}$ oscillations, while an asymmetric vector like fermion
doublet DM with mass around 100 GeV is a good candidate for DAMA annual
modulation yet satisfying the constraints from Xenon100 data.

smoothness by showing that smoothness is also enforced when the hand maintains
contact with a curved surface. Maximally smooth motions over curved surfaces
occur along geodesic lines that depend on fundamental features of the surface,
such as its radius and center of curvature. Subjects were requested to execute
movements of the hand while in contact with a virtual sphere that they could
not see. We found that with practice, subjects tended to move their hand along
smooth trajectories, near geodesic pathways joining start to end positions, to
reduce contact forces with constrained boundary, variance of contact force,
tangential velocity profile error and sum of square jerk along the time span of
movement. Furthermore, after practicing movements in a region of the sphere,
subjects executed near-geodesic movements, less contact forces, less contact
force variance, less tangential velocity profile error and less sum of square
jerk in a different region. These findings suggest that the execution of smooth
movements while the hand is in contact with a surface is a means for extracting

Herbig-Haro objects (HHOs) have been interpreted as arising in a photochemistry
stimulated by the HHO radiation on high density quiescent clumps in molecular
clouds. Static models of this process have been successful in accounting for
the variety of molecular species arising ahead of the jet; however recent
observations show that the enhanced molecular emission is widespread along the
jet as well as ahead. Hence, a realistic model must take into account the
movement of the radiation field past the clump. It was previously unclear as to
whether the short interaction time between the clump and the HHO in a moving
source model would allow molecules such as HCO+ to reach high enough levels,
and to survive for long enough to be observed. In this work we model a moving
radiation source that approaches and passes a clump. The chemical picture is
qualitatively unchanged by the addition of the moving source, strengthening the
idea that enhancements are due to evaporation of molecules from dust grains. In
addition, in the case of several molecules, the enhanced emission regions are
longer-lived. Some photochemically-induced species, including methanol, are
expected to maintain high abundances for ~10,000 years.

response of such networks under large isotropic deformations, we provide
insight into the origins of the strain stiffening and softening behavior of

particular, the nonlinear response is controlled by the isostatic connectivity,
which depends strongly on the applied strain. Our predictions for the strain
dependence of the isostatic point as well as the strain-dependent differential
bulk modulus agree well with numerical results in both two and three

Lorentz-violating kinetic term, introducing a Lorentz-violation mass scale $M$,
from which fermions and the flavour-mixing vector get their dynamical masses,
whereas the vector coupled without flavour mixing remains massless. When the
two coupling constants have similar values in order of magnitude, a mass
hierarchy pattern emerges, in which one fermion is very light compared to the
other, whilst the vector mass is larger than the mass of the heavy fermion. The
work presented here may be considered as a Lorentz-symmetry-Violating
alternative to the Higgs mechanism, in the sense that no scalar particle
(fundamental or composite) is necessary for the generation of the vector-meson
mass. However, the model is not realistic given that, as a result of Lorentz
Violation, the maximal (light-cone) speed seen by the fermions is smaller than
that of the massless gauge boson (which equals the speed of light in vacuo) by
an amount which is unacceptably large to be compatible with the current tests
of Lorentz Invariance, unless the gauge couplings assume unnaturally small

Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the dynamics of the
system in terms of the continuity equation and of the hydrodynamic Euler
equations. The non-relativistic and Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational
condensate can be described as a gas, whose density and pressure are related by
a barotropic equation of state. In the case of a condensate with quartic
non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic with index one. In the
framework of the Thomas-Fermi approximation the structure of the Newtonian
gravitational condensate is described by the Lane-Emden equation, which can be
exactly solved. The case of the rotating condensate is also discussed. General
relativistic configurations with quartic non-linearity are studied numerically
with both non-relativistic and relativistic equations of state, and the maximum
mass of the stable configuration is determined. Condensates with particle
masses of the order of two neutron masses (Cooper pair) and scattering length
of the order of 10-20 fm have maximum masses of the order of 2 M_sun, maximum
central density of the order of 0.1-0.3 10^16 g/cm^3 and minimum radii in the
range of 10-20 km. In this way we obtain a large class of stable astrophysical
objects, whose basic astrophysical parameters (mass and radius) sensitively
depend on the mass of the condensed particle, and on the scattering length. We

an entropic force. The central element in Verlinde's derivation is information
and its relation with entropy through the holographic principle. The
application of this approach to the case of superconductors requires to take
into account that information associated with superconductor's quantum vacuum
energy is not stored on Planck size surface elements, but in four volume cells
with Planck-Einstein size. This has profound consequences on the type of
gravitational force generated by the quantum vacuum condensate in
superconductors, which is closely related with the cosmological repulsive
acceleration responsible for the accelerated expansion of the Universe.
Remarkably this new gravitational type force depends on the level of breaking
of the weak equivalence principle for cooper pairs in a given superconducting
material, which was previously derived by the author starting from similar
principles. It is also shown that this new gravitational force can be
interpreted as a surface force. The experimental detection of this new
