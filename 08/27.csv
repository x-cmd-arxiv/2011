The effects of the domain size, wall tilt and curvature, on charge
accumulation, are analyzed using the Landau-Ginsburg Devonshire (LGD) theory
for polarization combined with Poisson equation for charge distributions. Both
the classical ferroelectric parameters including expansion coefficients in
2-4-6 Landau potential and gradient terms, as well as flexoelectric coupling,
inhomogeneous elastic strains and electrostriction are included in the present
analysis. Spatial distributions of the ionized donors, free electrons and holes
were found self-consistently using the effective mass approximation for the
respective densities of states. The proximity and size effect of the electron
and donor accumulation/depletion by thin stripe domains and cylindrical
nanodomains are revealed. In contrast to thick domain stripes and thicker
cylindrical domains, in which the carrier accumulation (and so the static
conductivity) sharply increases at the domain walls only, small nanodomains of
radius less then 5-10 correlation length appeared conducting across entire
cross-section. Implications of such conductive nanosized channels may be
promising for nanoelectronics.

corrections to the ratio of shear viscosity \eta\ to entropy density s. We
start with higher-derivative extensions of Einstein gravity in asymptotically
anti-de Sitter spacetimes. It is assumed that these theories are derived from
string theory and thus have a unitary UV completion that is dual to a unitary,
UV-complete boundary gauge theory. We then propose that the gravitational
perturbations about a solution of the UV complete theory are described by an
effective theory whose linearized equations of motion have at most two time
derivatives. Our proposal leads to a concrete prescription for the calculation
of \eta/s for theories of gravity with arbitrary higher-derivative corrections.
The resulting ratio can take on values above or below 1/4\pi\ and is consistent
with all the previous calculations, even though our reasoning is substantially
different. For the purpose of calculating \eta/s, our proposal also leads to
only two possible candidates for the effective two-derivative theory: Einstein
and Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The distinction between the two is that Einstein
gravity satisfies the equivalence principle, and so its graviton correlation
functions are polarization independent, whereas the Gauss-Bonnet theory has
polarization-dependent correlation functions. We discuss the graviton
three-point functions in this context and explain how these can provide
additional information on the value of \eta/s.

found broad application in materials science, nanoscience and biology(1-3).
With the introduction of aberration-corrected electron lenses, both the spatial
resolution and image quality in TEM have been significantly improved(4,5) and
resolution below 0.5 {\AA} has been demonstrated(6). To reveal the 3D structure
of thin samples, electron tomography is the method of choice(7-11), with
resolutions of ~1 nm^3 currently achievable(10,11). Recently, discrete
tomography has been used to generate a 3D atomic reconstruction of a silver
nanoparticle 2-3 nm in diameter(12), but this statistical method assumes prior
knowledge of the particle's lattice structure and requires that the atoms fit
rigidly on that lattice. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a
general electron tomography method that achieves atomic scale resolution
without initial assumptions about the sample structure. By combining a novel
projection alignment and tomographic reconstruction method with scanning
transmission electron microscopy, we have determined the 3D structure of a ~10
nm gold nanoparticle at 2.4 {\AA} resolution. While we cannot definitively
locate all of the atoms inside the nanoparticle, individual atoms are observed
in some regions of the particle and several grains are identified at three
dimensions. The 3D surface morphology and internal lattice structure revealed
are consistent with a distorted icosahedral multiply-twinned particle. We
anticipate that this general method can be applied not only to determine the 3D
structure of nanomaterials at atomic scale resolution(13-15), but also to
improve the spatial resolution and image quality in other tomography
fields(7,9,16-20).

entanglement (between sender and receiver) is needed in order to simulate many
copies of a quantum channel in the presence of free classical communication. In
this paper we show how to express this quantity as a regularised optimisation
of the entanglement formation over states that can be generated between sender
and receiver. Our formula is the channel analog of a well-known formula for the
entanglement cost of quantum states in terms of the entanglement of formation;
and shares a similar relation to the recently shattered hope for additivity.
The entanglement cost of a quantum channel can be seen as the analog of the
quantum reverse Shannon theorem in the case where free classical communication
is allowed. The techniques used in the proof of our result are then also
inspired by a recent proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem and feature
the one-shot formalism for quantum information theory, the post-selection
technique for quantum channels as well as Sion's minimax theorem. We discuss
two applications of our result. First, we are able to link the security in the
noisy-storage model to a problem of sending quantum rather than classical
information through the adversary's storage device. This not only improves the
range of parameters where security can be shown, but also allows us to prove
security for storage devices for which no results were known before. Second,
our result has consequences for the study of the strong converse quantum
capacity. Here, we show that any coding scheme that sends quantum information
through a quantum channel at a rate larger than the entanglement cost of the
channel has an exponentially small fidelity.

corrupted observations, which is known as robust principal component analysis
(RPCA), has attracted tremendous interests and found many applications in
computer vision. Recently, this problem has been formulated as recovering a
low-rank component and a sparse component from the observed data matrix. It is
proved that under some suitable conditions, this problem can be exactly solved
by principal component pursuit (PCP), i.e., minimizing a combination of nuclear
norm and $l_1$ norm. Most of the existing methods for solving PCP require
singular value decompositions (SVD) of the data matrix, resulting in a high
computational complexity, hence preventing the applications of RPCA to very
large scale computer vision problems. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, called $l_1$ filtering, for \emph{exactly} solving PCP with an
$O(r^2(m+n))$ complexity, where $m\times n$ is the size of data matrix and $r$
is the rank of the matrix to recover, which is supposed to be much smaller than
$m$ and $n$. Moreover, $l_1$ filtering is \emph{highly parallelizable}. It is
the first algorithm that can \emph{exactly} solve a nuclear norm minimization
problem in \emph{linear time} (with respect to the data size). Experiments on
both synthetic data and real applications testify to the great advantage of
$l_1$ filtering in speed over state-of-the-art algorithms.

Hotta and
Kashiwara defined a holonomic D-module M, on g x h, called Harish-Chandra
module. We relate gr(M), an associated graded module with respect to a
canonical Hodge filtration on M, to the isospectral commuting variety, a
subvariety of g x g x h x h which is a ramified cover of the variety of pairs
of commuting elements of g. Our main result establishes an isomorphism of gr(M)
with the structure sheaf of X_norm, the normalization of the isospectral
commuting variety. It follows, thanks to the theory of Hodge modules, that the
normalization of the isospectral commuting variety is Cohen-Macaulay and
Gorenstein, confirming a conjecture of M. Haiman. We deduce, using Saito's
theory of Hodge D-modules, that the scheme X_norm is Cohen-Macaulay and
Gorenstein. This confirms a conjecture of M. Haiman.
  Associated with any principal nilpotent pair in g, there is a finite
subscheme of X_norm. The corresponding coordinate ring is a bigraded finite
dimensional Gorenstein algebra that affords the regular representation of the
Weyl group. The socle of that algebra is a 1-dimensional vector space generated
by a remarkable W-harmonic polynomial on h x h. In the special case where
g=gl_n the above algebras are closely related to the n!-theorem of Haiman and
our W-harmonic polynomial reduces to the Garsia-Haiman polynomial. Furthermore,
in the gl_n case, the sheaf gr(M) gives rise to a vector bundle on the Hilbert
scheme of n points in C^2 that turns out to be isomorphic to the Procesi
bundle. Our results were used by I. Gordon to obtain a new proof of positivity
of the Kostka-Macdonald polynomials established earlier by Haiman.

during the transitional disc phase as gas damping becomes ineffectual. Using an
ensemble of FARGO hydrodynamic simulations and MERCURY n-body integrations, we
directly follow planet-disc and planet-planet interactions through the clearing
phase and on through 50 Myr of dynamical evolution. Disc clearing occurs via
X-ray driven photoevaporation. The hydrodynamic evolution of individual
scattering systems is complex, and involves phases in which massive planets
orbit within eccentric gaps, or accrete directly from the disc without a gap.
Comparing the results to a gas-free model, we find that the n-body dynamics and
hydrodynamics of scattering into one- and two-planet final states are almost
identical. The eccentricity distributions in these channels are almost
unaltered by the presence of gas. The hydrodynamic simulations, however, also
form low eccentricity three-planet systems in long-term stable configurations,
and the admixture of these systems results in modestly lower eccentricities in
hydrodynamic as opposed to gas-free simulations. The incidence of these
three-planet systems is likely a function of the initial conditions; different
planet setups (number or spacing) may change the character of this result. We
analyze the properties of surviving multiple planet systems, and show that only
a small fraction (a few percent) enter mean-motion resonances after scattering,
while a larger fraction form stable resonant chains and avoid scattering
entirely. Our results remain consistent with the hypothesis that exoplanet
eccentricity results from scattering, though the detailed agreement between
observations and gas-free simulation results is likely coincidental. We discuss
the prospects for testing scattering models by observing planets or
non-axisymmetric gas structure in transitional discs.

molecular gas is more concentrated towards the center of galaxies than the
atomic gas, and as a consequence, the resulting stellar distribution is very
compact. For halos with total mass above 10^{11} Mo, the median half-mass
radius of the stellar disks is 0.8 kpc at z = 3. The vertical structure of the
molecular disk is much thinner than that of the atomic neutral gas. Relative to
the non-radiative run, the inner regions of the dark matter halo change shape
from prolate to mildly oblate and align with the stellar disk. However, we do
not find evidence for a significant dark disk of dark matter around the stellar
disk. The outer halo regions retain the orientation acquired during accretion
and mergers, and are significantly misaligned with the inner regions. The
radial profile of the dark matter halo contracts in response to baryon
dissipation, establishing an approximately isothermal profile throughout most
of the halo. This effect can be accurately described by a modified model of
halo contraction. The angular momentum of a fixed amount of inner dark matter
is approximately conserved over time, while in the dissipationless case most of
it is transferred outward during mergers. The conservation of the dark matter

Fixing an n-category C, the blob complex associates a chain complex B_*(W;C)$
to any n-manifold W. The 0-th homology of this chain complex recovers the usual
topological quantum field theory invariants of W. The higher homology groups
should be viewed as generalizations of Hochschild homology (indeed, when W=S^1
they coincide). The blob complex has a very natural definition in terms of
homotopy colimits along decompositions of the manifold W. We outline the
important properties of the blob complex, and sketch the proof of a
generalization of Deligne's conjecture on Hochschild cohomology and the little
discs operad to higher dimensions.

denaturation of long DNA sequences by adjusting slightly the base pairing
contribution. The adjusted model leads to (i) critical temperatures for long
homogeneous sequences that are in good agreement with both experimental ones
and those obtained from statistical models, (ii) a realistic step-like
denaturation behaviour for long inhomogeneous sequences, and (iii) critical
forces at ambient temperature of the order of 10 pN, close to measured values.
The adjusted model furthermore supports the conclusion that the thermal
denaturation of long homogeneous sequences corresponds to a first-order phase
transition and yields a critical exponent for the critical force equal to
sigma=0.70. This model is both geometrically and energetically realistic, in
the sense that the helical structure and the grooves, where most proteins bind,
are satisfactorily reproduced, while the energy and force required to break a
base pair lie in the expected range. It therefore represents a promising tool
for studying the dynamics of DNA-protein specific interactions at an
unprecedented detail level.

due to their ability to provide an accurate directional analysis of images

is performed -- which occurs in particular when an additive noise is corrupting
the signal to be analyzed -- it is useful to characterize the statistical
properties of the dual-tree wavelet coefficients of this process. As dual-tree
decompositions constitute overcomplete frame expansions, correlation structures
are introduced among the coefficients, even when a white noise is analyzed. In
this paper, we show that it is possible to provide an accurate description of
the covariance properties of the dual-tree coefficients of a wide-sense
stationary process. The expressions of the (cross-)covariance sequences of the
coefficients are derived in the one and two-dimensional cases. Asymptotic
results are also provided, allowing to predict the behaviour of the
second-order moments for large lag values or at coarse resolution. In addition,
the cross-correlations between the primal and dual wavelets, which play a
primary role in our theoretical analysis, are calculated for a number of
classical wavelet families. Simulation results are finally provided to validate
these results.

structure), however, none of the standard approaches can discard the hypothesis
when no solution can be found, since none can provide a proof that there is no
admissible structure. This article presents an algorithm that introduces a
novel type of solution method to ""efficiently"" solve the graph 3-coloring
problem; an NP-complete problem. The proposed method provides certificates
(proofs) in both cases: present or absent, so it is possible to accept or
reject the hypothesis on the basis of a rigorous proof. It provides exact
solutions and is polynomial-time (i.e., efficient) however parametric. The only
requirement is sufficient computational power, which is controlled by the
parameter $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$. Nevertheless, here it is proved that the
probability of requiring a value of $\alpha>k$ to obtain a solution for a
random graph decreases exponentially: $P(\alpha>k) \leq 2^{-(k+1)}$, making
tractable almost all problem instances. Thorough experimental analyses were
performed. The algorithm was tested on random graphs, planar graphs and
4-regular planar graphs. The obtained experimental results are in accordance
with the theoretical expected results.

show that, similarly to what is found in three dimensions, at fixed chemical

$h_c$, the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit of superfluidity, has the same value as
in three dimensional systems. We show that for a fixed ratio
$\epsilon_B/\epsilon_F$, where $\epsilon_F$ is the two-dimensional Fermi
energy, as the density imbalance $m$ is increased from zero, the ground state
evolves from BCS to phase separation to the normal state. At the critical
imbalance $m_c$ phase separation is not supported and the normal phase is
energetically preferable. The BCS-BEC crossover is discussed in balanced and
imbalanced configurations. Possible pictures of what may be found

potential of the proposed dish concept for low-cost and mass production and
demonstrate sensitivity comparable to that of the presently considered off-set

  Service Envelope Approach","20 Pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic network calculus is an evolving theory which accounts for
statistical multiplexing and uses an envelope approach for probabilistic delay
and backlog analysis of networks. One of the key ideas of stochastic network
calculus is the possibility to describe service offered at network node as a
stochastic service envelope, which in turn can be used to describe the
stochastic service available in a network of nodes and determine end-to-end
probabilistic delay and backlog bounds. This paper introduces a new definition
of stochastic service envelopes which yield a simple network service envelope
and tighter end-to-end performance bounds. It is shown for ($\sigma(\theta),
\rho(\theta)$) - constrained traffic model that the end-to-end performance
measures computed using the new stochastic network service envelope are tight
in comparison to the ones obtained using the existing start-of-the-art
definition of statistical network service envelope and are bounded by ${\cal
O}(H \log{H})$, where $H$ is the number of nodes traversed by the arrival
traffic.

ground state properties of a superfluid confined in a two-dimensional trap. The
trapping potential is assumed to be radial and homogeneous of degree larger
than two in addition to a quadratic term. Three critical rotational velocities
are identified, marking respectively the first appearance of vortices, the
creation of a `hole' of low density within a vortex lattice, and the emergence
of a giant vortex state free of vortices in the bulk. These phenomena have
previously been established rigorously for a `flat' trap with fixed boundary
but the `soft' traps considered in the present paper exhibit some significant
differences, in particular the giant vortex regime, that necessitate a new
approach. These differences concern both the shape of the bulk profile and the
size of vortices relative to the width of the annulus where the bulk of the
superfluid resides. Close to the giant vortex transition the profile is of
Thomas-Fermi type in `flat' traps, whereas it is gaussian for soft traps, and
the `last' vortices to survive in the bulk before the giant vortex transition
are small relative to the width of the annulus in the former case but of
comparable size in the latter.

Fourier-space basis. I then compute the Fisher matrix for the power spectrum in

Our proof is different and is easier, even in its general form. But

the ring to the third homology group of the general linear group of the ring.
From there we take an easier path.

$n\le n_{\max}$, $n_{\max}\propto N$ magnons or electrons as well as the
contribution of these states (independent localized states) to thermodynamic
quantities. Moreover, we discuss another class of low-lying eigenstates
(so-called interacting localized states) and calculate their contribution to
the partition function. We also discuss the effect of extra interactions, which
lift the degeneracy present due to the chirality of the localized states on
triangles. The localized states set an extra low-energy scale in the system and
lead to a nonzero residual ground-state entropy and to one (or more) additional
low-temperature peak(s) in the specific heat. Low-energy degrees of freedom in
the presence of perturbations removing degeneracy owing to the chirality can be
described in terms of an effective (pseudo)spin-1/2 transverse $XX$ chain.

Eddington bias. We compare the observations and simulations using the following
statistical tests: the distributions of ensemble and individual existence
probabilities (in the >M,>z sense), the redshift distributions, and the 2d
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Using seemingly rare clusters from Hoyle et al.

the (>M,>z) existence probabilities of all clusters are fully consistent with
LCDM. However assuming the same survey geometry, we use the 2d K-S test
probability to show that the observed clusters are not consistent with being
the least probable clusters from simulations at >95% confidence, and are also
not consistent with being a random selection of clusters, which may be caused
by the non-trivial selection function and survey geometry. Tension can be
removed if we examine only a X-ray selected sub sample, with simulations

universally to matter gives rise to an extra centripetal force and will have
observable signatures on cosmological and astronomical observations. Several
tests are performed using data including galaxy rotation curves of 22 spiral
galaxies of varied luminosities and sizes, and perihelion precessions of
planets in the solar system.
  The rotation curves of the same group of galaxies are independently fit using
a dark matter model with the generalized Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) profile
and the string model. A Remarkable fit of galaxy rotation curves is achieved
using the one-parameter string model as compared to the three-parameter dark
matter model with the NFW profile. The average $\chi^2$ value of the NFW fit is
9\% better than that of the string model at a price of two more free
parameters. Furthermore, from the string model, we can give a dynamical
explanation for the phenomenological Tully-Fisher relation. We are able to
derive a relation between field strength, galaxy size and luminosity, which can
be verified with data from the 22 galaxies.
  To further test the hypothesis of the universal existence of the string gauge
field, we apply our string model to the solar system. Constraint on the
magnitude of the string field in the solar system is deduced from the current
ranges for any anomalous perihelion precession of planets allowed by the latest
observations. The field distribution resembles a dipole field originating from
the Sun. The string field strength deduced from the solar system observations
is of a similar magnitude as the field strength needed to sustain the
rotational speed of the Sun inside the Milky Way. This hypothesis can be tested
further by future observations with higher precision.

heterogeneous surface reactions with hybrid computational models that couple a
KMC model for a surface to a finite difference model for bulk diffusion in a

hybrid method and also show that this method captures the combined effects of
nonlinearity and stochasticity. We first validate a simple
deposition/dissolution model with a linear rate showing that the KMC-continuum
hybrid agrees with both a fully deterministic model and its analytical
solution. We then study a deposition/dissolution model including competitive
adsorption, which leads to a nonlinear rate, and show that, in this case, the
KMC-continuum hybrid and fully deterministic simulations do not agree. However,
we are able to identify the difference as a natural result of the stochasticity

model. Therefore, we consider the KMC-continuum hybrid to be more
representative of a real system.
