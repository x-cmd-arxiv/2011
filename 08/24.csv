  Networks in Resting Brain","Accepted in Neuroimage Journal",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analysis of brain activity in resting-state is of fundamental importance in
identifying functional characteristics of neuronal system. Although resting
brain has been extensively investigated for low frequency synchrony between
brain regions, namely Functional Connectivity (FC), the other main stream of
brain connectivity analysis that seeks causal interactions between brain
regions, Effective Connectivity (EC), has been little explored in spontaneous
brain oscillations. Inherent complexity of brain activities in resting-state,
as is observed in BOLD (Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependant) fluctuations, call
for exploratory methods for characterizing these causal networks. On the other
hand, the inevitable effects that hemodynamic system imposes on causal
inferences based on fMRI data, lead us toward the methods in which causal
inferences can take place in latent neuronal level, rather than observed BOLD
time-series. To simultaneously satisfy these two concerns, in this paper, we
introduce a novel state-space system identification approach for studying
causal interactions among brain regions in the absence of explicit cognitive
task. Using extensive simulations, we study the effects of network size and
signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of our proposed method in EC
detection. Our simulations demonstrate that Subspace-based Identification
Algorithm (SIA) is sufficiently robust against above-mentioned factors, and can
reliably unravel the underlying causal interactions of resting-state BOLD fMRI

valuable characteristics that their eccentricity and argument of pericentre
remain constant on average. This study investigates quasi-circular frozen
orbits and examines their basic nature analytically using two different
methods. First, an analytical method based on Lagrangian formulations is
applied to obtain constraint conditions for Martian frozen orbits. Second, Lie
transforms are employed to locate these orbits accurately, and draw the
contours of the Hamiltonian to show evolutions of the equilibria. Both methods
are verified by numerical integrations in an 80\times80 Mars gravity field. The
simulations demonstrate that these two analytical methods can provide accurate
enough results. By comparison, the two methods are found well consistent with
each other, and both discover four families of Martian frozen orbits: three
families with small eccentricities and one family near the critical
inclination. The results also show some valuable conclusions: for the majority
of Martian frozen orbits, argument of pericentre are kept at 270 degrees
because J3 has the same sign with J2; while for a minority of ones with low
altitude and low inclination, argument of pericentre are possible to be kept at
90 degrees because of the effect of the higher degree odd zonals; for the
critical inclinations cases, argument of pericentre can also be kept at 90
degrees. It is worthwhile to note that there exist some special frozen orbits
with extremely small eccentricity, which could provide much convenience for
reconnaissance. Finally, the stability of Martian frozen orbits is estimated
based on the trace of the monodromy matrix. The analytical investigations can
provide good initial conditions for numerical correction methods in the more
complex models.

some kinetic models of wealth exchange. The concept of a walk in an abstract
gain-loss space for the agents had been introduced in an earlier work. For
models in which agents do not save, or save with uniform saving propensity,
this walk has diffusive behavior. In case the saving propensity $\lambda$ is
distributed randomly ($0 \leq \lambda < 1$), the resultant walk showed a
ballistic nature (except at a particular value of $\lambda^* \approx 0.47$).
Here we consider several other features of the walk with random $\lambda$.
While some macroscopic properties of this walk are comparable to a biased
random walk, at microscopic level, there are gross differences. The difference
turns out to be due to an antipersistent tendency towards making a gain (loss)
immediately after making a loss (gain). This correlation is in fact present in
kinetic models without saving or with uniform saving as well, such that the
corresponding walks are not identical to ordinary random walks. In the
distributed saving case, antipersistence occurs with a simultaneous overall
bias.

F-universal, if every H in F is contained in G as a subgraph. The construction
of sparse universal graphs for various families F has received a considerable
amount of attention. One is particularly interested in tight F-universal
graphs, i.e., graphs whose number of vertices is equal to the largest number of
vertices in a graph from F. Arguably, the most studied case is that when F is
some class of trees.
  Given integers n and \Delta, we denote by T(n,\Delta) the class of all
n-vertex trees with maximum degree at most \Delta. In this work, we show that
every n-vertex graph satisfying certain natural expansion properties is
T(n,\Delta)-universal or, in other words, contains every spanning tree of
maximum degree at most \Delta. Our methods also apply to the case when \Delta
is some function of n. The result has a few very interesting implications. Most
importantly, we obtain that the random graph G(n,p) is asymptotically almost
surely (a.a.s.) universal for the class of all bounded degree spanning (i.e.,
n-vertex) trees provided that p \geq c n^{-1/3} \log^2n where c > 0 is a
constant. Moreover, a corresponding result holds for the random regular graph
of degree pn. In fact, we show that if \Delta satisfies \log n \leq \Delta \leq
n^{1/3}, then the random graph G(n,p) with p \geq c \Delta n^{-1/3} \log n and
the random r-regular n-vertex graph with r \geq c\Delta n^{2/3} \log n are
a.a.s. T(n,\Delta)-universal. Another interesting consequence is the existence
of locally sparse n-vertex T(n,\Delta)-universal graphs. For constant \Delta,
we show that one can (randomly) construct n-vertex T(n,\Delta)-universal graphs
with clique number at most five. Finally, we show robustness of random graphs
with respect to being universal for T(n,\Delta) in the context of the
Maker-Breaker tree-universality game.

on $D_{m} = \Omega_{m}^{\alpha_{m}}$, where $\alpha_{m} = 2m/(4m-3)$ for $m\geq
1$. The first result, more appropriate for the unforced case, can be stated
simply : if there exists an $1\leq m < \infty$ for which the integral condition
is satisfied ($Z_{m}=D_{m+1}/D_{m}$) $$ \int_{0}^{t}\ln (\frac{1 +
Z_{m}}{c_{4,m}}) d\tau \geq 0$$ then no singularity can occur on $[0, t]$. The
constant $c_{4,m} \searrow 2$ for large $m$. Secondly, for the forced case, by
imposing a critical \textit{lower} bound on $\int_{0}^{t}D_{m} d\tau$, no
singularity can occur in $D_{m}(t)$ for \textit{large} initial data. Movement
across this critical lower bound shows how solutions can behave intermittently,
in analogy with a relaxation oscillator. Potential singularities that drive

to O(100) GeV gauge singlet scalars produced in the annihilation of the O(TeV)

investigation offers a set of generalized complex structures and associated
properties of differentiable manifolds. We have shown that the convexity of
arbitrary entropy function can be realized in an extended subfield of the
eigenvalues of the Hessian $\mathcal B$ of Sen entropy function. Thus, the
spectra of $\mathcal B$ are analyzed by defining Krull of the corresponding
semisymplectic algebras. From the framework of commutative algebra, we find
that the convex hull of the eigenvalues defines a generalized spectrum of

many eigenvalues of $ \mathcal B $. For the minimally extended subfield, we
show that the spectrum of $ \mathcal B $ reduces to the thermodynamic type
spectra, at the attractor fixed point(s). In the limit of $ AdS_2 \times

We generalize this concept in a solid-on-solid growth model, in which a barrier
dependent on the particle coordination (number of lateral bonds) exists
whenever the particle performs an interlayer diffusion. The rules do not
distinguish explicitly if the particle is executing a descending or an
ascending interlayer diffusion. We show that the usual model, with a step
barrier in descending steps, produces spurious, columnar, and highly unstable
morphologies if the growth temperature is varied in a usual range of mound

to resonance states which could be used by experimental groups: numerical
problem of the convergence of the DWBA matrix element when the full transition
operator is included and it is unclear what spectroscopic information can be
extracted from the analysis of transfer reactions populating the resonance
states. The purpose of this paper is to address both questions. The theory of
the deuteron stripping is developed, which is based on the post continuum
discretized coupled channels (CDCC) formalism going beyond of the DWBA and
surface integral formulation of the reaction theory [A. S. Kadyrov et al., Ann.
Phys. {\bf 324}, 1516 (2009)]. First, the formalism is developed for the DWBA
and then extended to the CDCC formalism, which is ultimate goal of this work.
The CDCC wave function takes into account not only the initial elastic $d+ A$
channel but also its coupling to the deuteron breakup channel $p + n + A$
missing in the DWBA. Stripping to both bound states and resonances are
included. The convergence problem for stripping to resonance states is solved
in the post CDCC formalism. The reaction amplitude is parametrized in terms of
the reduced width amplitudes (ANCs), inverse level matrix, boundary condition
and channel radius, that is the same parameters which are used in the
conventional $R$-matrix method. For stripping to resonance states many-level,
one and two-channel cases are considered. The theory provides a consistent tool
to analyze both binary resonant reactions and deuteron stripping in terms of
the same parameters.

  subsumed by another straightforward reduction",,,,"cs.CC cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a redundant dictionary $\Phi$, represented by an $M \times N$ matrix
($\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$) and a target signal $y \in \mathbb{R}^M$,
the \emph{sparse approximation problem} asks to find an approximate
representation of $y$ using a linear combination of at most $k$ atoms. In this
paper, a new complexity theoretic hardness result for sparse approximation
problem is presented via considering a different measure of quality for the
solution. It is argued that, from an algorithmic standpoint, the problem is
more meaningful if it asks to maximize the norm of the target signal's
projection onto the selected atoms which are represented by column vectors.
Then, a multiplicative inapproximability result is established with this new
measure, under a reasonable complexity theoretic assumption. This result in
turn implies additive inapproximability for the problem with the standard
measure. Specifically, if $ZPP \neq NP$, all polynomial time algorithms which
provide a $k$-sparse vector $x$ should satisfy
  $$ {\|y-\Phi x\|}_2^2 \geq (1-c){\|y-\Phi x^*\|}_2^2 + c {\|y\|}_2^2, $$
  \noindent for $1/4(1-1/e) > c \geq 0$ where $x^*$ is the optimal $k$-sparse
solution. This result provides a quantification of the hardness for the case
$y-\Phi x^* = 0$, revealing more details about the inherent structure of the
problem.

formed on Au1,3/MgO. For the catalytic active system Au8/MgO, it has been
predicted that this complex opens an alternative catalytic reaction pathway

interrupted by the dissociation of the remaining (OH)2 complex after forming

The rms of the orbital solution is just 47 m/s, making it the most precise
orbit ever obtained for an active binary system. The rotation period is
constrained from long-term photometry to be 58.32+-0.01 days. It shows that HD
123351 is a very asynchronous rotator, rotating five times slower than the
expected pseudo-synchronous value. Two spotted regions persisted throughout the
12 years of our observations. Four years of Halpha, CaII H&K and HeI D3
monitoring identifies the same main periodicity as the photometry but dynamic
spectra also indicate that there is an intermittent dependence on the orbital
period, in particular for Ca ii H&K in 2008. Line-profile inversions of a pair
of Zeeman sensitive/insensitive iron lines yield an average surface
magnetic-flux density of 542+-72 G. The time series for 2008 is modulated by
the stellar rotation as well as the orbital motion, such that the magnetic flux
is generally weaker during times of periastron and that the chromospheric
emissions vary in anti-phase with the magnetic flux. We also identify a broad
and asymmetric lithium line profile and measure an abundance of log n(Li) =
1.70+-0.05. The star's position in the H-R diagram indicates a mass of 1.2+-0.1
Msun and an age of 6-7 Gyr. We interpret the anti-phase relation of the
magnetic flux with the chromospheric emissions as evidence that there are two
magnetic fields present at the same time, a localized surface magnetic field
associated with spots and a global field that is oriented towards the
(low-mass) secondary component.

paths between pairs of nodes (the so-called small-world phenomenon); moreover,
participants are able to route messages along these paths even though each
person is only aware of a small part of the network topology. Some sociologists
conjecture that participants in such scenarios use a greedy routing strategy in
which they forward messages to acquaintances that have more categories in
common with the recipient than they do, and similar strategies have recently
been proposed for routing messages in dynamic ad-hoc networks of mobile
devices. In this paper, we introduce a network property called membership
dimension, which characterizes the cognitive load required to maintain
relationships between participants and categories in a social network. We show
that any connected network has a system of categories that will support greedy
routing, but that these categories can be made to have small membership

nanobeam, is coupled via radiation pressure to a pair of co-localized 200THz
optical modes. The mechanical mode is cooled close to its quantum ground state
from a bath temperature of 18K using radiation pressure back-action stemming
from the optical pumping of one of the optical cavity resonances. An optical
probe beam, resonant with the second optical cavity resonance, is used to
transduce the mechanical motion and determine the phonon occupancy of the
mechanical mode. Measurement of the asymmetry between up-converted and
down-converted photons of the probe beam yields directly the displacement noise
power associated with the quantum zero-point motion of the mechanical
oscillator, and provides an absolute calibration of the average phonon
occupancy of the mechanical mode.

imaging data of a z = 0.9057 galaxy that is being strongly lensed by a massive
galaxy cluster at a redshift of z=0.3838. The lens (BCS J2352-5452) was
discovered while examining i- and z-band images being acquired in October 2006
during a BCS observing run. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the GMOS
instrument on the Gemini South 8m telescope confirmed the lensing nature of
this system. Using weak plus strong lensing, velocity dispersion, cluster
richness N_200, and fitting to an NFW cluster mass density profile, we have
made three independent estimates of the mass M_200 which are all very
consistent with each other. The combination of the results from the three
methods gives M_200 = (5.1 +- 1.3) x 10^14 M_Sun, which is fully consistent
with the individual measurements. The final NFW concentration c_200 from the
combined fit is c_200 = 5.4(+1.4 -1.1). We have compared our measurements of
M_200 and c_200 with predictions for (a) clusters from Lambda_CDM simulations,
(b) lensing selected clusters from simulations, and (c) a real sample of
cluster lenses. We find that we are most compatible with the predictions for
Lambda_CDM simulations for lensing clusters, and we see no evidence based on
this one system for an increased concentration compared to Lambda_CDM. Finally,
using the flux measured from the [OII]3727 line we have determined the star
formation rate (SFR) of the source galaxy and find it to be rather modest given
the assumed lens magnification.

In addition to sensitivity issues, a main limitation of image recovery in
intensity interferometry is the loss of phase of the complex degree of
coherence during the measurement process. Nevertheless, several
model-independent phase reconstruction techniques have been developed. Here we
implement a Cauchy-Riemann based algorithm to recover images from simulated
data. For bright stars (m_v~6) and exposure times of a few hours, we find that
scale features such as diameters, oblateness and overall shapes are
reconstructed with uncertainties of a few percent. More complex images are also
well reconstructed with high degrees of correlation with the pristine image.
Results are further improved by using a forward algorithm.

CDM models, the collapse time of CDM overdensity is well monitored by the
linear-theory extrapolated overdensity of CDM plus baryon perturbation,

that proposed by Zel'dovich et al., in which a fine-tuned spatial gradient in
the chemical induction time is required to be maintained within the turbulent

They also provide constraints on the nature of the first stars, their
associated supernovae and initial mass function, and early star and galaxy
formation. The Milky Way's dwarf satellites contain a large fraction (~30%) of
the known most metal-poor stars that have chemical abundances that closely

19 candidate intermediate mass BHs (M_{BH} < 10^{6} Msun) found by Greene & Ho
2004 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We used the Hobby-Eberly Telescope
to obtain 30 spectra over a period of 178 days in an attempt to resolve the
reverberation time lag (tau) between the continuum source and the broad line
region (BLR) in order to determine the radius of the BLR (R_{BLR}) in GH08. We
measure tau to be 2 days with an upper limit of 6 days. We estimate the AGN
luminosity at 5100 Angstroms to be approximately 1.1 x 10^{43} erg s^{-1} after
deconvolution from the host galaxy. The most well calibrated R_{BLR}-L relation
predicts a time lag which is 4 times larger than what we measure. Using the
measured H\beta\ full-width-at-half-maximum of 703 (+/-) 110 km s^{-1} and an
upper limit for R_{BLR} = 6 light days, we find M_{BH} < 5.8 x 10^{5} Msun as
an upper limit to the BH virial mass in GH08, which implies super-Eddington
accretion. Based on our measured M_{BH} we propose that GH08 may be another
candidate to add to the very short list of AGNs with M_{BH} < 10^{6} Msun

almost model-independent way, nucleon excitation and non-resonant reaction
amplitudes by complete measurements of pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction off

measurements of elastic electron scattering and exclusive single-meson and
double-pion electroproduction cross sections off the nucleon that will be
extended to higher momentum transfers with the energy-upgraded CEBAF beam at
JLab to study the dressed quark degrees of freedom, where their strong
interaction is responsible for the ground and excited nucleon state formations.
After establishing unprecedented high-precision data, the immanent next
challenge is a high-quality analysis to extract these relevant electrocoupling
parameters for various resonances that then can be compared to state of the art

Algebraic stepping could be particularly useful for novice programmers or

of parallel program rewriting. It represents a compromise between Launchbury's

half-duplex MIMO multihop networks that utilize the
automatic-retransmission-request (ARQ) protocol both in the asymptotic high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and in the finite SNR regime. We propose
novel ARQ protocol designs that optimize these tradeoffs. We first derive the
diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff (DMDT) in the high SNR regime, where the
delay is caused only by retransmissions. This asymptotic DMDT shows that the
performance of an N node network is limited by the weakest three-node
sub-network, and the performance of a three-node sub-network is determined by
its weakest link, and, hence, the optimal ARQ protocol needs to equalize the
performance on each link by allocating ARQ window sizes optimally. This
equalization is captured through a novel Variable Block-Length (VBL) ARQ
protocol that we propose, which achieves the optimal DMDT.
  We then consider the DMDT in the finite SNR regime, where the delay is caused
by both the ARQ retransmissions and queueing. We characterize the finite SNR
DMDT of the fixed ARQ protocol, when an end-to-end delay constraint is imposed,
by deriving the probability of message error using an approach that couples the
information outage analysis with the queueing network analysis. The exponent of
the probability of deadline violation demonstrates that the system performance
is again limited by the weakest three-node sub-network. The queueing delay
changes the consideration for optimal ARQ design: more retransmissions reduce
decoding error by lowering the information outage probability, but may also
increase message drop rate due to delay deadline violations. Hence, the optimal
ARQ should balance link performance while avoiding significant delay.

has received attention in recent years. Using data on the relationship between
transmission and viral load we show that transmission saturates at high viral
loads. We fit a power-law model and an exponential converging to an asymptote.
Using data on the viral load in HIV-positive people we show that ART is likely
to reduce transmission by 91.6% (81.7%-96.2%) under the first and 99.5%
(98.5%-99.8%) under the second model.
  The role of the acute phase in HIV transmission is still debated. High levels
of transmission during the acute phase have been used to argue that failure to
identify people in the acute phase of HIV may compromise the impact of
treatment on preventing new infections and that having concurrent sexual
partners during the acute phase is an important driver of the epidemic. We show
that the acute phase probably accounts for less than 1% of overall
transmission. We also show that even if a significant proportion of infections
are transmitted during the acute phase, this will not compromise the impact of
treatment on population levels of transmission given the constraint implied by
the doubling time of the epidemic.
  This analysis leads to other relevant conclusions. First, it is likely that
discordant-couple studies significantly underestimate the risk of infection.
Second, attention should be paid to the variability in set point viral load
which determines both the infectiousness of HIV-positive people and the
variability in the susceptibility of HIV-negative people. Third, if ART drugs
are in short supply those with the highest viral load should be given priority,
others things including age, gender and opportunistic infections being equal,
but to reduce transmission ART should be offered to all those with a viral load

a stellar mass of 10^{11.5}Msun at z~0.6. This is in striking contrast to
z~0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declines
monotonically with stellar mass. At stellar masses of 10^{12}Msun, therefore,
the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z~0.6 to the

massive, star-forming galaxies at z~0.6, we find that half of their [OIII]

values. First, we consider the critical value associated with the strength of
the singular potential for the Klein-Gordon equation. We expand the solution in
the random variable associated with the parameter. The obtained partial
differential equations are solved using the Chebyshev collocation method. Due
to the existence of the singularity, the Gibbs phenomenon appears in the
solution, yielding a slow convergence of the numerically computed critical
value. To deal with the singularity, we adopt the consistent spectral
collocation method. The gPC method, along with the consistent Chebyshev method,
determines the critical value and the mean solution highly efficiently. We then
consider the sine-Gordon equation, for which the critical value is associated
with the initial velocity of the kink soliton solution. The critical behavior
in this case is that the solution passes through (particle-pass), is trapped by
(particle-capture), or is reflected by (particle-reflection) the singular
potential if the initial velocity of the soliton solution is greater than,
equal to, or less than the critical value, respectively. We use the gPC mean
value rather than reconstructing the solution to find the critical parameter.
Numerical results show that the critical value can be determined efficiently
and accurately by using the proposed method.

of condensed matter physics. Two types of topologically nontrivial insulators
have been extensively studied. The first type is characterized by a nonzero
TKNN invariant or Chern number[1] which is directly related to the quantization
of Hall conductance in the integer quantum Hall effect. Haledane propose a
model with this type of band structure even in the absence of a macroscopic
magnetic field[2]. We refer to such materials ""Chern insulator"". The second
type called ""Z2 topological insulators"" is proposed recently[3, 4]. Quantum
spin Hall effect has been predicted and observed in such systems.[5, 6].
Despite the recent intensively study there are still some fundamental problems
that aren't quite clear about Z2 insulators even at the single-particle level.
For example, it's claimed that Z2 insulators will return to its origin state
after two cycles, thus coupling to the reservoirs is important for the Z2
insulators to continuously pump spin[7]. Theoretical and experimental results
show quantum spin Hall effect is an edge state transport property of the
materials and coupling to the reservoir seems not play an important role. So
the Z2 picture is not satisfactory in explaining these phenomena. We study the
relationship of the ground states of Z2 insulators and that of Chern insulator.
Combined with the results of recent researches on polarization of Chern
insulators[8] and topology of edge states[9] we propose a coherent physics
picture of topological insulators.

temperature difference between resistively- and thermodynamically-determined

textured superconducting planes that are nucleated preferentially along the

form via annealing of amorphous precursors in the hot, inner region of a
protoplanetary disk, where the temperatures needed for such transformations
were found, and were then transported outward by some dynamical means. Here we
develop a means of tracking the paths that dust grains would have taken through
a diffusive protoplanetary disk and examine the types and ranges of
environments that particles would have seen over a 10$^{6}$ year time period in
the dynamic disk. We then combine this model with three annealing laws to
examine how the dynamic evolution of amorphous grains would have led to their
physical restructuring and their delivery to various regions of the disk. It is
found that ""sibling particles""-- those particles that reside at the same
location at a given period of time--take a wide range of unique and independent
paths through the disk to arrive there. While high temperatures can persist in
the disk for very long time periods, we find that those grains which are
delivered to the cold outer regions of the disk are largely annealed in the
first few $\times10^{5}$ yrs of disk history. This suggests that the
crystallinity of grains in the outer disk would be determined early and remain
unchanged for much of disk history, in agreement with recent astronomical

Ordinary Earth satellites are usually placed into five categories of special

orbits, repeating ground track orbits, and geostationary orbits. This paper
investigates their counterparts around Mars and examines the basic nature of
these orbits, which are of special interest for missions conducted around Mars,
including Mars reconnaissance. Mars' gravity field is much more complicated,
with relatively smaller J2, compared to Earth's, which makes the behaviors of
these Martian orbits different from those of Earth. Analytical formulations and
numerical simulations are used to analyze these Martian orbits and compare them
with their Earth counterparts. First, mean element theory is employed to
describe variations of orbital elements and give the constraint conditions for
achieving these special orbits. Then, numerical verifications based on the
PSODE algorithm (particle swarm optimization combined with differential
evolution) are adopted to provide more accurate conditions for achieving these
orbits when considering an Mars gravity field. Using the numerical method can
significantly improve the design in the full gravity field, and it is therefore
possible to select these usable orbits for Mars that can reduce or eliminate
the need for stationkeeping.

tools for variable selection and sensitivity analysis based on the recently
proposed dynamic tree model. We argue that this approach is uniquely well
suited to the demands of our motivating example. In illustrations on benchmark
data sets, we show that the new techniques are faster and offer richer feature
sets than do similar approaches in the static tree and computer experiment
literature. We apply the methods in code-tuning optimization, examination of a
cold-cache effect, and detection of transformation errors.

Kerr black holes predicted by General Relativity. However, direct observational
evidence for this identification is still elusive, and the only viable approach
to confirm the Kerr black hole hypothesis is to explore and rule out any other
possibility. Here we investigate the final stages of the accretion process onto
generic compact objects. While for Kerr black holes and for more oblate bodies
the accreting gas reaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and
plunges into the compact object, we find that for more prolate bodies several
scenarios are possible, depending on the spacetime geometry. In particular, we
find examples in which the gas reaches the ISCO, but then gets trapped between
the ISCO and the compact object. In this situation, accretion onto the compact
object is possible only if the gas loses additional angular momentum, forming
torus-like structures inside the ISCO.

J1808.4-3658 during its quiescent state and 2008 outburst. The binary,
containing an accretion-powered millisecond pulsar, has a large sinusoidal-like
modulation in its quiescent optical emission. We employ a Markov chain Monte
Carlo technique to fit our multi-band light curve data in quiescence with an
irradiated star model, and derive a tight constraint of $50^{+6}_{-5}$ deg on
the inclination angle $i$ of the binary system. The pulsar and its companion
are constrained to have masses of $0.97^{+0.31}_{-0.22} M_{\sun}$ and
$0.04^{+0.02}_{-0.01} M_{\sun}$ (both 1$\sigma$ ranges), respectively. The
dependence of these results on the measurements of the companion's projected
radial velocity is discussed. We also find that the accretion disk had nearly
constant optical fluxes over a $\sim$500 day period in the quiescent state our
data covered, but started brightening 1.5 months before the 2008 outburst.
Variations in modulation during the outburst were detected in our four
observations made 7-12 days after the start of the outburst, and a
sinusoidal-like modulation with 0.2 mag amplitude changed to have a smaller
amplitude of 0.1 mag. The modulation variations are discussed. We estimate the
albedo of the companion during its quiescence and the outburst, which was
approximately 0 and 0.8 (for isotropic emission), respectively. This large
difference probably provides additional evidence that the neutron star in the
binary turns on as a radio pulsar in quiescence.

however, has been hindered by the lack of a systematic approach to scaling down
the mode as the structures shrink in size and by the high threshold power
required for lasing in small cavities. Here we present a new family of
metamaterial-like nano-cavities consisting of metallic coaxial nanostructures
that solves both of these problems. The proposed nanoscale coaxial cavities can
operate as thresholdless lasers, and their size is not restricted by the mode
cut-off. Using these new nano-cavities we have succeeded to demonstrate for the
first time thresholdless lasing in a broadband gain medium, and the smallest
room temperature, continuous wave, telecom laser to date. The nanoscale coaxial

ultra small quantum electrodynamical objects in which atom-field interactions

decoupling sequence (QDD) for the coherence control of a qubit coupled to a
bath of spins. We investigate the influence of the geometry and of the initial
conditions of the bath on the performance of the sequence. The overall
performance is quantified by a distance norm $d$. It is expected that $d$
scales with $T$, the total duration of the sequence, as $T^{\min
\{N_x,N_z\}+1}$, where $N_x$ and $N_z$ are the number of pulses of the outer
and of the inner sequence, respectively. We show both numerically and
analytically that the state of the bath can boost the performance of QDD under
certain conditions: The scaling of QDD for a given number of pulses can be
enhanced by a factor of 2 if the bath is prepared in a highly symmetric state
and if the system Hamiltonian is SU(2) invariant.

development of nanotechnologies. For applications in nanomedicine, particles
need to be functionalized to ensure a good dispersibility in biological fluids.
In many cases however, functionalization is not sufficient : the particles
become either coated by a corona of serum proteins or precipitate out of the
solvent. In the present paper, we show that by changing the coating of iron
oxide nanoparticles from a low-molecular weight ligand (citrate ions) to small
carboxylated polymers (poly(acrylic acid)), the colloidal stability of the
dispersion is improved and the adsorption/internalization of iron towards
living mammalian cells is profoundly affected. Citrate-coated particles are
shown to destabilize in all fetal-calf-serum based physiological conditions
tested, whereas the polymer coated particles exhibit an outstanding
dispersibility as well as a structure devoid of protein corona. The
interactions between nanoparticles and human lymphoblastoid cells are
investigated by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. Two types
of nanoparticle/cell interactions are underlined. Iron oxides are found either
adsorbed on the cellular membranes, or internalized into membrane-bound
endocytosis compartments. For the precipitating citrate-coated particles, the
kinetics of interactions reveal a massive and rapid adsorption of iron oxide on
the cell surfaces. The quantification of the partition between adsorbed and
internalized iron was performed from the cytometry data. The results highlight
the importance of resilient adsorbed nanomaterials at the cytoplasmic membrane.

Earth mass in the habitable zone and further away, around nearby stars for F,
G, and K spectral types. This survey would provide the actual planetary masses,
the full characterization of the orbits including their inclination, for all

high-precision astrometry, in space, can detect the dynamical effect due to
even low mass orbiting planets on their central star, reaching those scientific
goals. NEAT will continue the work performed by Hipparcos (1mas precision) and
Gaia (7{\mu}as aimed) by reaching a precision that is improved by two orders of
magnitude (0.05{\mu}as, 1{\sigma} accuracy). The two modules of the payload,
the telescope and the focal plane, must be placed 40m away leading to a
formation flying option studied as the reference mission. NEAT will operate at
L2 for 5 years, the telescope satellite moving around the focal plane one to
point different targets and allowing whole sky coverage in less than 20 days.
The payload is made of 3 subsystems: primary mirror and its dynamic support,
the focal plane with the detectors, and the metrology. The principle is to
measure the angles between the target star, usually bright (R \leq 6), and
fainter reference stars (R \leq 11) using a metrology system that projects
dynamical Young's fringes onto the focal plane. The proposed architecture
relies on two satellites of about 700 kg, offering a capability of more than
20,000 reconfigurations. The two satellites are launched in a stacked
configuration using a Soyuz ST launch, and are deployed after launch to
individually perform cruise to their operational Lissajous orbit.

Previous experimental studies indicate that the regularity of oscillatory
dynamics is enhanced when noisy oscillators interact and become synchronized.
This effect, called the collective enhancement of temporal precision, has been
studied theoretically using particular assumptions. In this study, we propose a
general theoretical framework that enables us to understand the dependence of
temporal precision on network parameters including size, connectivity, and
coupling intensity; this effect has been poorly understood to date. Our
framework is based on a phase oscillator model that is applicable to general
oscillator networks with any coupling mechanism if coupling and noise are
sufficiently weak. In particular, we can manage general directed and weighted
networks. We quantify the precision of the activity of a single cell and the
mean activity of an arbitrary subset of cells. We find that, in general
undirected networks, the standard deviation of cycle-to-cycle periods scales
with the system size $N$ as $1/\sqrt{N}$, but only up to a certain system size
$N^*$ that depends on network parameters. Enhancement of temporal precision is
ineffective when $N>N^*$. We also reveal the advantage of long-range
interactions among cells to temporal precision.

paper we expose the empirical evidence for the existence of discrete
GDP-tubulin fluctuations between a curved and a straight configuration at room
temperature as well as for conformational tubulin cooperativity. Guided by a
number of experimental findings, we build the case for a novel microtubule
model, with the principal result that microtubules can spontaneously form
micron size cooperative helical states with unique elastic and dynamic
features. The polymorphic dynamics of the microtubule lattice resulting from
the tubulin bistability quantitatively explains several experimental puzzles
including anomalous scaling of dynamic fluctuations of grafted microtubules,
their apparent length-stiffness relation and their remarkably curved-helical
appearance in general. We point out that tubulin dimers's multistability and
its cooperative switching could participate in important cellular processes,

most important actors in a social network. This has resulted in several
measures of influence and authority. While most of such sociometrics (e.g.,
PageRank) are driven by intuitions based on an actors location in a network,
asking for the ""most influential"" actors in itself is an ill-posed question,
unless it is put in context with a specific measurable task. Constructing a
predictive task of interest in a given domain provides a mechanism to
quantitatively compare different measures of influence. Furthermore, when we
know what type of actionable insight to gather, we need not rely on a single
network centrality measure. A combination of measures is more likely to capture
various aspects of the social network that are predictive and beneficial for
the task. Towards this end, we propose an approach to supervised rank
aggregation, driven by techniques from Social Choice Theory. We illustrate the
effectiveness of this method through experiments on Twitter and citation
networks.

Buckingham's $\Pi$ theorem to obtain dimensionless similarity parameters given
that some (non- unique) method exists that can differentiate different
functional groups of individuals within an ecosystem. We then obtain the
relationship between the similarity parameters under the assumptions of (i)
that the ecosystem is in a dynamically balanced steady state and (ii) that
these functional groups are connected to each other by the flow of resource.
The expression that we obtain relates the level of complexity that the
ecosystem can support to intrinsic macroscopic variables such as density,
diversity and characteristic length scales for foraging or dispersal, and
extrinsic macroscopic variables such as habitat size and the rate of supply of
resource. This expression relates these macroscopic variables to each other,
generating commonly observed macroecological patterns; these broad trends
simply reflect the similarity property of ecosystems. We thus find that details
of the ecosystem function are not required to obtain these broad
macroecological patterns this may explain why they are ubiquitous. Departures
from our relationship may indicate that the ecosystem is in a state of rapid
change, i.e., abundance or diversity explosion or collapse. Our result provides
normalised variables that can be used to isolate the trend in one ecosystem
variable from another, providing a new method for isolating macroecological
patterns in data. A dimensionless control parameter for ecosystem complexity
emerges from our analysis and this will be a control parameter in dynamical
models for ecosystems based on energy flow and conservation and will order the
emergent behaviour of these models.

Velocity gradients of more than 1 km s$^{-1}$ are present in Lupus 1 and 3 and
multiple gas components are present in these clouds along some lines of sight.
Lupus 1 is the cloud richest in high density cores, 8 cores were detected in

the three species HC$_3$N, NH$_3$ and N$_2$H$^+$ changes significantly in the

NH$_3$ and N$_2$H$^+$ and vice versa. We found that the column density ratios
HC$_3$N/N$_2$H$^+$ and HC$_3$N/NH$_3$ change by one order of magnitude between
the cores, indicating that also the chemical abundance of these species is
different. The time dependent chemical code that we used to model our cores
shows that the HC$_3$N/N$_2$H$^+$ and HC$_3$N/NH$_3$ ratios decrease with time

indicator of the chemical evolution of dense cores. On this base we classified
5 out of 8 cores in Lupus 1 and 1 out of 5 cores in Lupus 3 as very young
protostars or prestellar cores. Comparing the millimetre cores population with
the population of the more evolved young stellar objects identified in the
Spitzer surveys, we conclude that in Lupus 3 the bulk of the star formation
activity has already passed and only a moderate number of stars are still
forming. On the contrary, in Lupus 1 star formation is on-going and several
dense cores are still in the pre--/proto--stellar phase. Lupus 4 is at an
intermediate stage, with a smaller number of individual objects.

independently experience neutral mutations, at constant rate $\theta$ during
their lifetimes, under the infinite-alleles assumption: each mutation
instantaneously confers a brand new type, called allele or haplotype, to its
carrier. The type carried by a mother at the time when she gives birth is
transmitted to the newborn. We are interested in the sizes and ages at time $t$
of the clonal families carrying the most abundant alleles or the oldest ones,
as $t\to\infty$, on the survival event. Intuitively, the results must depend on
how the mutation rate $\theta$ and the Malthusian parameter $\alpha>0$ compare.
Hereafter, $N\equiv N_t$ is the population size at time $t$, constants $a,c$
are scaling constants, whereas $k,k'$ are explicit positive constants which
depend on the parameters of the model. When $\alpha>\theta$, the most abundant
families are also the oldest ones, they have size $cN^{1-\theta/\alpha}$ and
age $t-a$. When $\alpha<\theta$, the oldest families have age $(\alpha
/\theta)t+a$ and tight sizes; the most abundant families have sizes
$k\log(N)-k'\log\log(N)+c$ and all have age $(\theta-\alpha)^{-1}\log(t)$. When
$\alpha=\theta$, the oldest families have age $kt-k'\log(t)+a$ and tight sizes;
the most abundant families have sizes $(k\log(N)-k'\log\log(N)+c)^2$ and all
have age $t/2$. Those informal results can be stated rigorously in expectation.
Relying heavily on the theory of coalescent point processes, we are also able,
when $\alpha\leq\theta$, to show convergence in distribution of the joint,
properly scaled ages and sizes of the most abundant/oldest families and to

proceeds, it is natural to expect that the black hole undergoes a topological
transition, wrapping around the shrinking compact dimension to merge with
itself and form a black string. However, the putative uniform charged black
string end state is singular and such a transition would violate (a reasonable
notion of) cosmic censorship. We present analytic and numerical evidence that
strongly suggests the absence of such a transition. Based on this evidence, we
expect that the Kaluza-Klein black hole horizon stays localized, despite the
increasingly constraining size of the compact dimension. On the other hand, the
deSitter horizon does change between spherical and cylindrical topologies in a

the type systems of programming languages are that they improve program
reliability or performance. But there is another, entirely different, reason
for doing so. In the right context, this information enables the software
artifacts we produce, the objects and methods, to exhibit much greater
malleability. For declaratively typed languages, we can obtain greater software
malleability by extending the model of method call so that assurance of a
method's availability can be provided by any non-nullable parameter, not simply
the target parameter, and by allowing the method's implementation to reside in
classes or objects other than the target..
  This paper examines the question of whether this hypothetical improvement in
software malleability is consistent with existing programming practice by
examining the question of the extent to which methods in existing software have
multiplicities of non-nullable parameters. The circumstance occurs frequently
enough to provide an important reason to introduce declarations of nullability

asserting that if $(S,r)$ with $|S|=n$ satisfies $e_r(S)=f_d(n)-o(n^2)$, then,
up to $o(n)$ points, $S$ is a Lenz construction with $r$ constant. Finally we
use stability to show that for $n$ sufficiently large (depending on $d$) the

connecting with electron data from Fermi-LAT and other experiments. Methods:
The GALPROP programme for cosmic-ray propagation, gamma-ray and synchrotron
radiation is used. Secondary electrons and positrons are included. Propagation
models based on cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data are tested against synchrotron
data from 22 MHz to 94 GHz. Results: The synchrotron data confirm the need for
a low-energy break in the cosmic-ray electron injection spectrum. The
interstellar spectrum below a few GeV has to be lower than standard models
predict, and this suggests less solar modulation than usually assumed.
Reacceleration models are more difficult to reconcile with the synchrotron
constraints. We show that secondary leptons are important for the
interpretation of synchrotron emission. We also consider a cosmic-ray
propagation origin for the low-energy break. Conclusions: Exploiting the
complementary information on cosmic rays and synchrotron gives unique and
essential constraints on electrons, and has implications for gamma rays. This
connection is especially relevant now in view of the ongoing PLANCK and Fermi

to depend parametrically on the orientation $\xi$ of one of the measuring

between the source and each one of the devices would seem clearly sufficient to
rule such an influence; however, not even schemes where the choice of

in some situations, a model of this type from violating the local bounds. In
particular, a random shift $\rho_{\lambda}(\lambda,\xi_1) \rightarrow
\rho_{\lambda}(\lambda,\xi_2) \rightarrow...\rightarrow
\rho_{\lambda}(\lambda,\xi_n)$ allows the model to perform a ""subensemble
selection"" for each of the terms involved in the inequality (analogous to what
goes on with the efficiency loophole), whenever some correlation of those
$\rho_{\lambda}$-shifts with the sequence of measurement choices is allowed.
That correlation does not necessarily imply signaling during the photon

discussed, including the important aspect of electron-vibrational coupling
within the Huang-Rhys model. Supplementing the model by the Coulombic
interactions between monomers, the description of aggregates in terms of
excitonic or vibrational-excitonic bands follows. Besides of giving rise to
complex absorption and emission line shapes, exciton-vibrational interaction is
responsible for energy and phase relaxation and thereby limits the size of
coherent excitations in larger aggregates. Throughout, emphasis is put on the
electronic three-level model as a minimum requirement to describe nonlinear
spectroscopies including effects of two-exciton states such as excited state
absorption and exciton-exciton annihilation. The experimentally observed
characteristics of stationary absorption and fluorescence spectra of aggregates
as well as their temperature dependence are discussed. Examples for ultrafast
spectroscopic experiments including pump-probe studies, photon echo and
two-dimensional spectroscopy are presented and results on the size of coherence
domains and on intra- and interband relaxation are given. Finally, experimental

This PSF model has been constructed via the stacking and centering of a large

PSF envelopes to form the spoke structures and the gross azimuthal shapes
observed. This PSF model is available for use within the XMM-Newton Science

we find that the classical belt is a complex region with sub-structures that go
beyond the usual splitting of inner (interior to 3:2 mean-motion resonance
[MMR]), outer (exterior to 2:1 MMR), and main (in between). The main classical
belt (a=40--47 AU) needs to be modeled with at least three components: the
`hot' component with a wide inclination distribution and two `cold' components
(stirred and kernel) with much narrower inclination distributions. The hot
component must have a significantly shallower absolute magnitude (Hg)
distribution than the other two components. With 95% confidence, there are
8000+1800-1600 objects in the main belt with Hg <= 8.0, of which 50% are from
the hot component, 40% from the stirred component and 10% from the kernel; the
hot component's fraction drops rapidly with increasing Hg. Because of this, the
apparent population fractions depend on the depth and ecliptic latitude of a
trans-neptunian survey. The stirred and kernel components are limited to only a
portion of the main belt, while we find that the hot component is consistent
with a smooth extension throughout the inner, main and outer regions of the
classical belt; the inner and outer belts are consistent with containing only
hot-component objects. The Hg <= 8.0 TNO population estimates are 400 for the
inner belt and 10,000 for the outer belt within a factor of two.

construction of a theory of gravity dynamically equivalent to general

does not possess foliation invariance, as does ADM. It replaces that ""symmetry""
by another: local conformal invariance. In so doing it more accurately reflects
a theory of the ""shape of space"", giving us reason to call it \emph{shape

some interesting new results which are not yet in print and were developed
alongside the writing of the thesis. The second part of the thesis will develop
a gauge theory for ""shape of space""--theories. To be more precise, if one
admits that the physically relevant observables are given by shape, our
descriptions of Nature carry a lot of redundancy, namely absolute local size
and absolute spatial position. This redundancy is related to the action of the
infinite-dimensional conformal and diffeomorphism groups on the geometry of
space. We will show that the action of these groups can be put into a language
of infinite-dimensional gauge theory, taking place in the configuration space
of 3+1 gravity. In this context gauge connections acquire new and interesting

formation of the Bucky-diamond structure. The formation process is initiated by
the induced bonds between pairs of surface carbon atoms of the initial
configuration of the Si68C79 cluster obtained by truncating bulk 3C-SiC
network. This action then continuously incorporates atoms in the six outer
shells of the Si68C79 clusters to form the 112-atom Fullerene shell through
nearest neighbor Si-C interactions. Because the 35-atom inner core with five
completely filled shells only interacts weakly with the Fullerene shell through
the six atoms on its ""surface"", the diamond-like inner core is barely perturbed
and is suspended inside the Fullerene shell. We have also suggested a likely
route of synthesizing the SiC Bucky-diamond structure based on the result of
our simulation.

contacts among individuals. Knowledge of these patterns is thus essential to
inform models and computational efforts. Few empirical studies are however
available that provide estimates of the number and duration of contacts among
social groups. Moreover, their space and time resolution are limited, so that
data is not explicit at the person-to-person level, and the dynamical aspect of
the contacts is disregarded. Here, we want to assess the role of data-driven
dynamic contact patterns among individuals, and in particular of their temporal
aspects, in shaping the spread of a simulated epidemic in the population.
  We consider high resolution data of face-to-face interactions between the
attendees of a conference, obtained from the deployment of an infrastructure
based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual
face-to-face proximity. The spread of epidemics along these interactions is
simulated through an SEIR model, using both the dynamical network of contacts
defined by the collected data, and two aggregated versions of such network, in
order to assess the role of the data temporal aspects.
  We show that, on the timescales considered, an aggregated network taking into
account the daily duration of contacts is a good approximation to the full
resolution network, whereas a homogeneous representation which retains only the
topology of the contact network fails in reproducing the size of the epidemic.
  These results have important implications in understanding the level of
detail needed to correctly inform computational models for the study and
management of real epidemics.

signal-to-noise ratio circularly polarised (Stokes V) spectra and 13
unpolarised (Stokes I) spectra of HD 148937 were acquired in 2009 and 2010. A
definite detection of a Stokes V Zeeman signature is obtained in the grand mean
of all observations (in both LSD mean profiles and individual spectral lines).
The longitudinal magnetic field inferred from the Stokes V LSD profiles is
consistently negative, in contrast to the essentially zero field strength
measured from the diagnostic null profiles. A period search of equivalent width
measurements confirms the previously-reported 7.03 d variability period. The
variation of equivalent widths is not strictly periodic: we present evidence
for evolution of the amount or distribution of circumstellar plasma.
Interpreting the 7.03 d period as the stellar rotational period within the
context of the ORM, we have phased the equivalent widths and longitudinal field
measurements. The longitudinal field measurements show a weak sinusoidal
variation of constant sign, with extrema out of phase with the H{\alpha}
variation by about 0.25 cycles. The inferred magnetic configuration confirms
the suggestion of Naz\'e et al (2010), who proposed that the weaker variability
of HD 148937 as compared to other members of this class is a consequence of the
stellar geometry. Based on the derived magnetic properties and published wind
characteristics, we find a wind magnetic confinement parameter \eta\ast \simeq
20 and rotation parameter W = 0.12, supporting a picture in which the Halpha
emission and other line variability have their origin in an oblique, rigidly
rotating magnetospheric structure resulting from a magnetically channeled wind.

pairs of hypothesis tests, and are valid if the p-value statistics are
independent and uniformly distributed under the null hypotheses. However, it
has recently been shown that these types of multiple testing procedures are
inefficient since such p-values do not depend upon all of the available data.
This paper provides tools for constructing compound p-value statistics, which
are those that depend upon all of the available data, but still satisfy the
conditions of independence and uniformity under the null hypotheses. As an
example, a class of compound p-value statistics for testing for location shifts
is developed. It is demonstrated, both analytically and through simulations,
that multiple testing procedures tend to reject more false null hypotheses when
applied to these compound p-values rather than the usual p-values, and at the
same time still guarantee the desired type I error rate control. The compound
p-values, in conjunction with two different multiple testing methods, are used
to analyze a real microarray data set. Applying either multiple testing method
to the compound p-values, instead of the usual p-values, enhances their powers.

strong binary interactions incurred during post-main-sequence evolution.
Planetary, brown dwarf or stellar companions located within a few AU of
main-sequence stars may become engulfed during the primary's expansion off the
main sequence. Sufficiently low-mass companions in-spiral inside a common
envelope until they are tidally shredded near the natal white dwarf. Formation
of an accretion disk from the disrupted companion provides a source of
turbulence and shear which act to amplify magnetic fields and transport them to
the WD surface. We show that these disk-generated fields explain the observed
range of magnetic field strengths for isolated, high-field magnetic WDs.
Additionally, we discuss a high-mass binary analogue which generates a
strongly-magnetized WD core inside a pre-collapse, massive star. Subsequent
core-collapse to a neutron star may produce a magnetar.

Boltzmann transport formalism is developed and applied to calculate the
transport characteristics of thin silicon nanowires (NWs) up to 12nm in
diameter. The sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled atomistic tight-binding (TB) model is
used for the electronic structure calculation. Linearized Boltzmann transport
theory is applied, including carrier scattering by phonons, surface roughness
(SRS), and impurities. We present a comprehensive investigation of the
low-field mobility in silicon NWs considering: i) n- and p-type NWs, ii) [100],
[110], and [111] transport orientations, and iii) diameters from D=12nm
(electronically almost bulk-like) down to D=3nm (ultra-scaled). The simulation
results display strong variations in the characteristics of the different NW
types. For n-type NWs, phonon scattering and SRS become stronger as the
diameter is reduced and drastically degrade the mobility by up to an order of
magnitude depending on the orientation. For the [111] and [110] p-type NWs, on
the other hand, large mobility enhancements (of the order of ~4X) can be
achieved as the diameter scales down to D=3nm. This enhancement originates from
the increase in the subband curvatures as the diameter is scaled. It
overcompensates for the mobility reduction caused by SRS in narrow NWs and
offers an advantage with diameter scaling. Our results may provide
understanding of recent experimental measurements, as well as guidance in the
design of NW channel devices with improved transport properties.

transition in pure and Al-doped magnetite (Fe_3O_4). The low temperature phase
of magnetite displays a number of additional Raman modes that serve as
transition markers. These transition markers allow one to investigate the
effect of hydrostatic pressure on the Verwey transition temperature. Al-doped
magnetite Fe_2.8Al_0.2O_4 (TV=116.5K) displays a nearly linear decrease of the
transition temperature with an increase of pressure yielding dP/dT_V = -0.096
GPa/K. In contrast pure magnetite displays a significantly steeper slope of the
PT equilibrium line with dP/dT_V = -0.18 GPa/K. The slope of the PT equilibrium
lines is related to the changes of the molar entropy and molar volume at the
transition. We compare our spectroscopic data with that obtained from the
ambient pressure specific heat measurements and find a good agreement in the
optimally doped magnetite. Our data indicates that Al doping leads to a smaller
entropy change and larger volume expansion at the transition. Our data displays
the trends that are consistent with the mean field model of the transition that
assumes charge ordering in magnetite.

frictional interfaces (contact area developments). Network theory is a
fundamental tool for the modern understanding of complex systems in which, by a
simple graph representation, the elementary units of a system become nodes, and
their mutual interactions become links. With this transformation of a system
into a network space, many properties of the system's structure and dynamics
can be inferred. The rupture sequence of shear fractures were studied using a
transformation form of contact patterns to complex networks; subsequently,
sub-graph abundance within the corresponding networks was analyzed. To
distinguish the different roles of collective deformation of an interface's
elements, pure and non-pure contact patches (i.e., aperture) were mapped onto
the nodes. The contact patches were connected with each other by using
measurements of similarities as well as constrained geometrical distance and
amount of net-contact area per patch, which yielded directed and non-directed
networks. A universal trend in sub-graph distribution was observed. We
confirmed that super-family phenomena are independent from rupture types in
shear processes (as well as in slow or sub-Rayleigh fronts). Furthermore,
global features of frictional interfaces as well as shear strength or hydraulic
properties were scaled with motifs evolution. In particular, it was found that
more common transitive motifs indicate residual shear strength stages, where
fluctuations of stored potential energy surrounding rupture tip were minimal.
Our approaches were tested over different available data sets, and it was found
that discrete as well as real-time contact measurements resulted in the same
universal patterns of sub-graphs
