the ideal and dissipative cases, taking into account the breaking of spatial
symmetries by a quantizing magnetic field. A complete set of transport
coefficients, consistent with the Curie and Onsager principles, is derived for
thermal conduction, as well as shear and bulk viscosities. It is shown that in
the most general case the dissipative function contains five shear viscosities,
two bulk viscosities, and three thermal conductivity coefficients. We use
Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator method to relate these transport
coefficients to correlation functions of equilibrium theory. The desired
relations emerge at linear order in the expansion of the non-equilibrium
statistical operator with respect to the gradients of relevant statistical
parameters (temperature, chemical potential, and velocity.) The transport
coefficients are cast in a form that can be conveniently computed using
equilibrium (imaginary-time) infrared Green's functions defined with respect to
the equilibrium statistical operator.

chemistry in the Horsehead Photo-dissociation region (PDR). Methods: We
performed deep observations of several H2CO rotational lines toward the PDR and
its associated dense-core in the Horsehead nebula, where the dust is cold ($\Td
\simeq 20-30$ K). We complemented these observations with a map of the p-H2CO
$~3_{03}-2_{02}$ line at 218.2 GHz (with 12"" angular resolution). We determine
the H2CO abundances using a detailed radiative transfer analysis and compare
these results with PDR models that include either pure gas-phase chemistry or
both gas-phase and grain surface chemistry. Results: The H2CO abundances
($\simeq 2-3 \times 10^{-10}$) with respect to H-nuclei are similar in the PDR
and dense-core. In the dense-core the pure gas-phase chemistry model reproduces
the observed H2CO abundance. Thus, surface processes do not contribute
significantly to the gas-phase H2CO abundance in the core. In contrast, the
formation of H2CO on the surface of dust grains and subsequent photo-desorption
into the gas-phase are needed in the PDR to explain the observed gas-phase H2CO
abundance, because the gas-phase chemistry alone does not produce enough H2CO.
The assignments of different formation routes are strengthen by the different
measured ortho-to-para ratio of H2CO: the dense-core displays the equilibrium
value ($\sim3$) while the PDR displays an out-of-equilibrium value ($\sim2$).
Conclusions: Photo-desorption of H2CO ices is an efficient mechanism to release
a significant amount of gas-phase H2CO into the Horsehead PDR.

their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are less contaminated by the

strength B and the Doppler factor delta of the radiation region by
incorporating the chi^{2}-minimization technique and the gamma-ray transparency
condition. Twenty-four out of the 34 SEDs can constrain B and delta in 1 sigma
significance level and others only present the limits for both B and delta. The
typical values of $B$ and delta are 0.1 ~ 0.6 G and 10 ~ 35, respectively. The
derived values of gamma_b are significantly different among sources and even
among the low and high states of a given source. Prominent flux variations with
a clear spectral shift are observed and a tentative correlation between the
ratio of the flux density at 1 TeV and the ratio of gamma_b in the low and high

electron acceleration may be responsible for the flux variations and the
spectral shift. A weak anti-correlation between the jet power and the mass of

reaction (HOR) due to sulfur adsorption and subsequent electrochemical
oxidation is quantified in a functional PEM fuel cell. At 70 {\deg}C,
sequential hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure and electrochemical oxidation
experiments indicate that as much as 6% of total Pt sites are deactivated per
monolayer sulfur adsorption at open circuit potential of a PEM fuel cell
followed by its removal. The extent of such deactivation is much higher when
the electrode is exposed to H2S when the fuel cell is operating at a finite
load, and is dependent on the local overpotential and the duration of exposure.
Regardless of this deactivation, the H2/O2 polarization curves obtained on
post-recovery electrodes do not show performance losses suggesting that such
performance curves alone cannot be used to assess the extent of recovery due to
sulfur poisoning. A concise mechanism for the adsorption and electro-oxidation
of H2S on Pt anode is presented. H2S dissociatively adsorbs onto Pt as two
different sulfur species and at intermediate oxidation potentials, undergoes
electro-oxidation to sulfur and then to sulfur dioxide (SO2). This mechanism is
validated by charge balances between hydrogen desorption and sulfur
electro-oxidation on Pt. The ignition potential for sulfur oxidation decreases
with increase in temperature, which coupled with faster electro-oxidation
kinetics result in the easier removal of adsorbed sulfur at higher
temperatures. Furthermore, the adsorption potential is found to influence
sulfur coverage of an electrode exposed to H2S. As an implication, the local
potential of a PEM fuel cell anode exposed to H2S contaminated fuel should be
kept below the equilibrium potential for sulfur oxidation to prevent
irreversible loss of Pt sites.

evolved in isolation. All these galaxies are spiral like and show some kind of
nuclear activity. The fraction of Narrow Line AGNs (NLAGNs) and Transition type
Objects (TOs; a NLAGN with circumnuclear star formation) is relatively high,
amounting to 64% of the galaxies. There is a definite trend for the NLAGNs to
appear in early-type spirals, while the star forming galaxies and TOs are found
in later-type spirals. We verify that the probability for a galaxy to show an
AGN characteristic increases with the bulge mass of the galaxy (Torre-Papaqui
et al. 2011), and find evidence that this trend is really a by-product of the
morphology, suggesting that the AGN phenomenon is intimately connected with the
formation process of the galaxies. Consistent with this interpretation, we
establish a strong connection between the astration rate--the efficiency with
which the gas is transformed into stars--the AGN phenomenon, and the
gravitational binding energy of the galaxies: the higher the binding energy,
the higher the astration rate and the higher the probability to find an AGN.
The NLAGNs in our sample are consistent with scaled-down or powered-down
versions of quasars and Broad Line AGNs.

Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham in the mid-1960s, is based upon the idea that the
complicated N-electron wavefunction can be replaced with the mathematically
simpler 1-electron charge density in electronic struc- ture calculations of the
ground stationary state. As such, ordinary DFT is neither able to treat
time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984,
Runge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information
about electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the
linear response (LR) theory formalism. Begin- ning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT
became increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of
medium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy
has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application. As the
number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT has grown, so too has grown
our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the approximate
functionals commonly used for TD-DFT. The objective of this article is to
continue where a previous review of TD-DFT in this series [Annu. Rev. Phys.

from the point of view of applied physical chemistry. Since doubly-excited
states have a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and
formation in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis will be
placed upon the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic

intergalactic medium (WHIM, T=10^5-10^7 K). Until now, WHIM surveys via BLAs
have been no less ambiguous than those via far-UV and X-ray metal-ion probes.
Detecting these weak, broad features requires background sources with a
well-characterized far-UV continuum and data of very high quality. However, a
recent HST/COS observation of the z=0.03 blazar Mrk421 allows us to perform a
metal-independent search for WHIM gas with unprecedented precision. The data
have high signal-to-noise (S/N~50 per ~20 km/s resolution element) and the
smooth, power-law blazar spectrum allows a fully-parametric continuum model. We
analyze the Mrk421 sight line for BLA absorbers, particularly for counterparts
to the proposed OVII WHIM systems reported by Nicastro et al. (2005a,b) based
on Chandra/LETG observations. We derive the Lya profiles predicted by the X-ray
observations. The signal-to-noise ratio of the COS data is high (S/N~25 per
pixel), but much higher S/N can be obtained by binning the data to widths
characteristic of the expected BLA profiles. With this technique, we are
sensitive to WHIM gas over a large (N_H, T) parameter range in the Mrk421 sight
line. We rule out the claimed Nicastro et al. OVII detections at their nominal
temperatures (T~1-2x10^6 K) and metallicities (Z=0.1 Z_sun) at >2 sigma level.
However, WHIM gas at higher temperatures and/or higher metallicities is
consistent with our COS non-detections.

photometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fits
is significantly poorer when these NIR data are included. Further, for a large
fraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from the
optical-plus-NIR photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred from
the optical data alone. This may indicate problems in our stellar population
library, or NIR data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for future
versions of the catalogue. For now, we have chosen to base our stellar mass
estimates on optical photometry only. In light of our decision to ignore the
available NIR data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained based
on optical data alone. We use generic properties of stellar population
synthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle a
very good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, M*/Li. Further, we use the
observed relation between restframe (g-i) and M*/Li for real GAMA galaxies to
argue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves,
(g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate M*/Li to an accuracy of < ~0.1
dex. This 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-M*/Li relation offers a simple and
transparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimal

gel. In the hybrid Molecular Dynamics (MD) / Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm,
aggregates of associating end groups form and break according to MC rules,
while the position of the polymers in space is dictated by MD. As a result, the
aggregate sizes change every time step. In order to describe this aggregation
process, we employ master equations. They define changes in the number of
aggregates of a certain size in terms of reaction rates. These reaction rates
indicate the likelihood that two aggregates combine to form a large one, or
that a large aggregate splits into two smaller parts. The reaction rates are
obtained from the simulations for a range of temperatures.
  Our results indicate that the rates are not only temperature dependent, but
also a function of the sizes of the aggregates involved in the reaction. Using
the measured rates, solutions to the master equations are shown to be stable
and in agreement with the aggregate size distribution, as obtained directly
from simulation data. Furthermore, we show how temperature induced variations
in these rates give rise to the observed changes in the aggregate distribution
that characterizes the sol-gel transition.

Abundance anomalies observed in a fraction of A and B stars of both
Pop I and II are apparently related to internal particle transport. Aims. Using
available constraints from Sirius A, we wish to determine how well evolutionary
models including atomic diffusion can explain observed abundance anomalies when
either turbulence or mass loss is used as the main competitor to atomic
diffusion. Methods. Complete stellar evolution models, including the effects of
atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations, have been computed from the zero
age main-sequence of 2.1M\odot stars for metallicities of Z0 = 0.01 \pm 0.001
and shown to agree with the observed parameters of Sirius A. Surface abundances
were predicted for three values of the mass loss rate and for four values of
the mixed surface zone. Results. A mixed mass of ~ 10^-6 M\odot or a mass loss
rate of 10^-13 M\odot/yr were determined through comparison with observations.
Of the 17 abundances determined observationally which are included in our
calculations, up to 15 can be predicted within 2 sigmas and 3 of the 4
determined upper limits are compatible. Conclusions. While the abundance
anomalies can be reproduced slightly better using turbulence as the process
competing with atomic diffusion, mass loss probably ought to be preferred since
the mass loss rate required to fit abundance anomalies is compatible with the
observationally determined rate. A mass loss rate within a factor of 2 of
10^-13 M\odot/yr is preferred. This restricts the range of the directly
observed mass loss rate.

electrode during electrochemical lithiation and delithiation by using the
Multi-beam Optical Sensor (MOS) technique. Upon lithiation, due to substrate
constraint, the silicon electrode initially undergoes elastic deformation,
resulting in rapid rise of compressive stress. The electrode begins to deform
plastically at a compressive stress of ca. -1.75 GPa; subsequent lithiation
results in continued plastic strain, dissipating mechanical energy. Upon
delithiation, the electrode first undergoes elastic straining in the opposite
direction, leading to a tensile stress of ca. 1 GPa; subsequently, it deforms
plastically during the rest of delithiation. The plastic flow stress evolves
continuously with lithium concentration. Thus, mechanical energy is dissipated
in plastic deformation during both lithiation and delithiation, and it can be
calculated from the stress measurements; we show that it is comparable to the
polarization loss. Upon current interrupt, both the film stress and the
electrode potential relax with similar time-constants, suggesting that stress
contributes significantly to the chemical potential of lithiated-silicon.

dimension $d_L$, there is in general a critical line of second order phase
transitions that separates the broken symmetry phase at finite temperatures
from the disordered phase. The phase transitions along this line are governed
by thermal critical exponents that are different from those associated with the
quantum critical point. We point out that, if the effective dimension of the
QCP, $d_{eff}=d+z$ ($d$ is the Euclidean dimension of the system and $z$ the
dynamic quantum critical exponent) is above its upper critical dimension $d_C$,
there is an intermingle of classical (thermal) and quantum critical

scaling relation $\psi=\nu z$ between the shift exponent $\psi$ of the critical
line and the crossover exponent $\nu z$, for $d+z>d_C$ by a \textit{dangerous
irrelevant interaction}. This phenomenon has clear experimental consequences,
like the suppression of the amplitude of classical critical fluctuations near
the line of finite temperature phase transitions as the critical temperature is
reduced approaching the QCP.

gauge theories to analytic treatment. Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field The-
ory, one way of connecting gravity dual models to gauge theories, is a
correspon- dence between a ten-dimensional Type IIB superstring theory in AdS5
\times S 5 and a N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. To describe systems that are
experimentally ac- cessible, however, the formal correspondence is modified
into a phenomenological duality between a five-dimensional gravity model and a
strongly coupled QCD-like gauge theory. This duality is referred to as AdS/QCD.
This work explores aspects of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. The phrase 'soft
wall' refers to the means of breaking the conformal symmetry and introducing a
mass scale to the gauge side of the duality. We add higher-order terms to the
soft-wall Lagrangian and calculate the effect on physical observables. Meson
mass spectra gain a more complex structure, exhibiting a better match with the
experimental values than previous models. The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner rela- tion
naturally emerges from the model. We calculate the form factor F{\pi} and the
coupling g{\rho}{\pi}{\pi} as a non-trivial test on the limits of our soft-wall
model. Introducing a black brane into the gravity dual metric allows us to
derive thermodynamic quantities in the gauge theory. As expected at high
temperatures, the entropy scales as the cube of the temperature, and the speed
of sound reaches its conformal limit of one-third. Thermal condensates
contribute leading-order terms, modifying the temperature, entropy, and free
energy behavior. We find that the system undergoes a phase transition from
hadronic matter to a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma at a critical
temperature.

microenvironment, effect tumour progression and represent a largely under
appreciated therapeutic target. We use observations of primary tumor biology
from prostate cancer to extrapolate a math- ematical model: specifically; it
has been observed that in prostate cancer three disparate cellular outcomes
predominate: (i) the tumour remains well differentiated and clinically indolent
- in this case the local stromal cells may act to restrain the growth of the
cancer; (ii) early in its genesis the tumour acquires a highly malignant
phenotype, growing rapidly and displacing the original stromal population
(often referred to as small cell prostate cancer) - these less common
aggressive tumours are relatively independent of the local microenvironment;
and, (iii) the tumour co-opts the local stroma - taking on a classic
stromagenic phenotype where interactions with the local microenviron- ment are
critical to the cancer growth. We present an evolutionary game theoretical
construct that models the influence of tumour-stroma interactions in driving
these outcomes. We consider three characteristic and distinct cellular
populations: stromal cells, tumour cells that are self-reliant in terms of
microenvironmental factors and tumour cells that depend on the environment for
resources but can also co-opt stroma. Using evolutionary game theory we explore
a number of different sce- narios that elucidate the impact of tumour-stromal

different treatments in the metastatic setting can affect different types of

passively-evolving galaxies over this redshift range is gradual and continuous,
with no evidence for an end or change to the process around z~1, as has been
hinted at by some surveys which analyze subsets of the data in isolation. The
size growth appears to be independent of stellar mass, with the mass-normalized

broadly related to systems of dynamically-interacting particles composed of
several different types of populations. They are applied to observations of
dense star clusters (SCs) in order to study gravitational interactions between
stars. We present a new analytic method of quantifying the frequency of
encounters involving single, binary and triple stars. With this technique, we
have shown that dynamical encounters involving triple stars occur commonly in
at least some SCs, and that they are likely to be an important dynamical
channel for stellar mergers to occur. We have also used our techniques to
analyze observational data for a large sample of SCs taken from the ACS Survey
for Globular Clusters. The results of this analysis are as follows: (1) We have
compiled a homogeneous catalogue of stellar populations for every cluster in
our sample, including main-sequence (MS), red giant branch, horizontal branch
and blue straggler (BS) stars. (2) With this catalogue, we have quantified the
effects of the cluster dynamics in determining the relative sizes and spatial
distributions of these stellar populations. (3) These results are particularly
interesting for BSs since they provide compelling evidence that they are
descended from binary stars. (4) Our analysis of the MS populations is
consistent with a remarkably universal initial stellar mass function in old
massive SCs in the Milky Way. This is a new result with important implications
for our understanding of star formation in the early Universe and, more
generally, the history of our Galaxy. Finally, we describe how our techniques
are ideally suited for application to a number of other outstanding puzzles of
modern astrophysics, including chemical reactions in the interstellar medium
and mergers between galaxies in galaxy clusters.

LCDM haloes, which have an average spin parameter <\lambda'_halo> = 0.031. The
average ratio between the specific angular momentum of disk galaxies and their
host dark matter haloes is therefore R_j = \lambda'_gal/\lambda'_halo =
0.61^{+0.13}_{-0.10}. This calls into question a standard assumption made in
the majority of all (semi-analytical) models for (disc) galaxy formation,
namely that R_j=1. Using simple disc formation models we show that it is
particularly challenging to understand why R_j is independent of halo mass,
while the galaxy formation efficiency (\epsilon_GF, proportional to the ratio
of galaxy mass to halo mass) reveals a strong halo mass dependence. We argue
that the empirical scaling relations between \epsilon_GF, R_j and halo mass
require both feedback (i.e., galactic outflows) and angular momentum transfer
from the baryons to the dark matter (i.e., dynamical friction). The efficiency
of angular momentum loss need to decrease with increasing halo mass. Such a
mass dependence may reflect a bias against forming stable discs in high mass,
low spin haloes or a transition from cold-mode accretion in low mass haloes to
hot-mode accretion at the massive end. However, current hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxy formation, which should include these processes, seem
unable to reproduce the empirical relation between \epsilon_GF and R_j. We
conclude that the angular momentum build-up of galactic discs remains poorly
understood.

reconsider antiprotons as a tool to constrain DM models discussing its power
and limitations. We provide updated constraints on a wide class of annihilating
DM models by comparing our predictions against the most up-to-date ap
measurements, taking also into account the latest spectral information on the
p, He and other CR nuclei fluxes. Doing that, we probe carefully the
uncertainties associated to both secondary and DM originated antiprotons, by
using a variety of distinctively different assumptions for the propagation of
CRs and for the DM distribution in the Galaxy. We find that the impact of the
astrophysical uncertainties on constraining the DM properties can be much
stronger, up to a factor of ~50, than the one due to uncertainties on the DM
distribution (~2-6). Remarkably, even reducing the uncertainties on the
propagation parameters derived by local observables, non-local effects can
still change DM model constraints even by 50%. Nevertheless, current ap data
place tight constraints on DM models, excluding some of those suggested in
connection with indirect and direct searches. Finally we discuss the power of
upcoming CR spectral data from the AMS-02 observatory to drastically reduce the
uncertainties discussed in this paper and estimate the expected sensitivity of
this instrument to some sets of DM models.

measure to regulate the infinite spacetime volume, and much of the current

found to lead to paradoxical behavior, and recently Bousso, Freivogel,
Leichenauer, and Rosenhaus have argued that, under reasonable assumptions, the
only consistent interpretation for such measures is that time must end at the
cutoff. Here we argue that there is an alternative, consistent formulation of
such measures, in which time extends to infinity. Our formulation begins with a
mathematical model of the infinite multiverse, which can be constructed without
the use of a measure. Probabilities, which obey all the standard requirements
for a probability measure, can then be defined by mathematical limits. They
have a peculiar feature, however, which we call time-delay bias: if the outcome
of an experiment is reported with a time delay that depends on the outcome,
then the observation of the reports will be biased in favor of the shorter time
delay. We show how the paradoxes can be resolved in this interpretation of the
measure.

event associated with the state transition. The position of IGR J17091-3624 in

the questions of the star formation rate (SFR), star formation efficiency (SFE)
and typical lifetime of the Class 0 protostellar phase in two nearby
cluster-forming clumps: the Serpens South and W40 protoclusters. We carried out
a 1.2 mm dust continuum mapping of the Aquila Rift complex with the MAMBO
bolometer array on the IRAM 30m telescope. We perform a systematic source
extraction in our millimeter continuum map. Based on complementary data from
the Herschel Gould Belt survey and Spitzer maps, we characterize the SEDs of
the 77 mm continuum sources detected with MAMBO and estimate their evolutionary
stages. Taking advantage of the comprehensive dataset available for the Serpens
South region, spanning wavelengths from 2 microns to 1.2 mm, we estimate the
numbers of young stellar objects (YSOs) at different evolutionary stages and
find a ratio of Class 0 to Class I protostars N(0)/N(I)=0.19-0.27. This low
ratio supports a scenario of relatively fast accretion at the beginning of the
protostellar phase, and leads to a Class 0 lifetime of ~4-9x10^{4} yr. We also
show that both the Serpens South and W40 protoclusters are characterized by
large fractions of protostars and high SFRs ~20-50 Msun.Myr^{-1}pc^{-2}, in
agreement with the idea that these two nearby clumps are active sites of
clustered star formation currently undergoing bursts of star formation, and
have the potential ability to form bound star clusters. While the formation of
these two protoclusters is likely to have been initiated in a very different
manner, the resulting protostellar populations are observed to be very similar.
This suggests that after the onset of gravitational collapse, the detailed
manner in which the collapse has been initiated does not affect much the
ability of a clump to form stars.

follow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows,
biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amounts
of dust. Here, we present GRB afterglow and host observations for a sample of
bursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visual
extinction along the sight-line. This facilitates an investigation of the
properties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of these
poorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts from
optically-selected samples. The hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse in
their properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than the
hosts of optically-bright events. We hence probe a different galaxy population,
suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,
chemically-evolved and metal-rich members. This also indicates that the dust
along the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probably
located in the diffuse ISM or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate GRB
environment. Some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young or of small
stellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxies
possess very dusty sight-lines due to a patchy dust distribution. The presented
observations establish a population of luminous, massive and correspondingly
chemically-evolved GRB hosts. This suggests that GRBs trace the global
star-formation rate better than studies based on optically-selected host
samples indicate, and the previously-claimed deficiency of high-mass host
galaxies was at least partially a selection effect.

and focus on how it is modified by generic higher derivative corrections
corresponding to curvature corrections on the gravity side of the duality. In
particular, certain curvature corrections are known to push the viscosity to
entropy ratio below its universal value. This disproves a longstanding
conjecture that such a universal value represents a strict lower bound for any

positions of the multiple images are well reproduced by a model in which the
total mass distribution of the deflector is described in terms of two singular
isothermal sphere profiles. By modelling the lens galaxy spectral energy
distributions, we measure the lens luminous masses and stellar mass-to-light
ratios. These values are used to disentangle the luminous and dark matter
components in the vicinity of the multiple images. We estimate that the dark
over total mass ratio projected within a cylinder centred on the primary lens
and with a radius of 12.6 kpc is 0.8 +/- 0.1. We contrast these measurements
with the typical values found at similar distances (in units of the effective
radius) in isolated lens galaxies and show that the amount of dark matter
present in these lens galaxies is almost a factor four larger than in field
lens galaxies with comparable luminous masses. Data and models are therefore
consistent with interpreting the lens of this system as a galaxy group. We
infer that the overdense environment and dark matter concentration in these
galaxies must have affected the assembly of the lens luminous mass components.
We conclude that further multi-diagnostics analyses on the internal properties
of galaxy groups have the potential of providing us a unique insight into the
complex baryonic and dark-matter physics interplay that rules the formation of

(LDPC) codes have offered good error correction performance and low decoding
complexity by employing the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. However,
special requirements in the quantum setting severely limit the structures such
quantum codes can have. While the entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism
overcomes this limitation by exploiting maximally entangled states (ebits),
excessive reliance on ebits is a substantial obstacle to implementation. This
paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quantum
LDPC codes which are obtainable from pairs of identical LDPC codes and consume
only one ebit, and studies the spectrum of attainable code parameters.

dwarfs (DWDs). For many of these systems, the exact nature of the evolutionary
channels by which they form remains uncertain. The canonical explanation calls
for the progenitor binary system to undergo two subsequent mass-transfer
events, both of which are unstable and lead to a common envelope (CE) phase.
However, it has been shown that if both CE events obey the standard alpha
prescription, it is not possible to reproduce all of the observed systems. As
an alternative prescription, the gamma-formalism was proposed, which
parametrizes the fraction of angular momentum carried away with mass loss, in
contrast to the alpha prescription, which parametrizes energy loss. We
demonstrate that the gamma-prescription is also inadequate in describing the
evolution of an arbitrary DWD binary; clearly we require a deeper understanding
of the physical mechanisms underlying their formation. We then present a
detailed model for the evolution of Red Giant -- Main Sequence binaries during
the first episode of mass transfer, and demonstrate that their evolution into
DWDs need not arise through two phases of dynamical mass loss. Instead, the
first episode of dramatic mass loss may be stable, non-conservative mass
transfer. The second phase is then well described by the alpha prescription. We
find that the considered progenitors can reproduce the properties of the
observed helium DWDs in which the younger component is the more massive.

reviewing the key features of our holographic model of large N QCD and
elaborating on some new results.The theory has matter in the fundamental
representation and the gauge coupling runs logarithmically with energy scale at
low energies. At the highest energies the theory becomes approximately scale
invariant, much like what we would expect for large N QCD although not with
asymptotic freedom. In this limit the theory has a gravity dual captured by an
almost classical supergravity description with a controlled quantum behavior,
such that by renormalizing the supergravity action, we can compute the stress
tensor of the dual gauge theory. From the stress tensor we obtain the shear
viscosity and the entropy of the medium at a temperature T, and the violation
of the bound for the viscosity to the entropy ratio is then investigated. By
considering dynamics of open strings in curved spacetime described by the
supergravity limit, we compute the drag and diffusion coefficients for a heavy
parton traversing the thermal medium. It is shown that both coefficients have a
logarithmic dependence on momentum, consistent with pQCD expectations. Finally,
we study the confinement/deconfinement mechanism for quarks by analyzing open
strings in the presence of the flavor seven branes. We find linear confinement
of quarks at low temperatures, while at high temperatures the quarkonium states
melt, a behavior consistent with the existence of a deconfined phase.

use in one case Fock states, while in the other case we use a basis built over
a particular coherent state, associated to each atomic state.
  It is shown that, when the number of atoms increases, the description of the

that can be calculated using Fock states, while the dimensionality needed to
obtain convergent results in the other basis decreases when the atomic number
increases, allowing calculations that are very difficult in the Fock basis.

The relationship between the luminosities and the metallicities of Galactic
globular clusters is found to be complex. Among luminous clusters there is a
correlation in the sense that the oldest clusters are slightly more metal
deficient than are younger clusters. However, no such clear-cut relationship is
found among the faintest globular clusters. The central concentration index C
of globular clusters is seen to be independent of metallicity. The dependence
of the half-light radii of globular clusters on their Galactocentric distances
can be approximated by the relation $R_h \alpha R^{2/3}_{gc}$. Clusters with
collapsed cores are mostly situated close to the Galactic nucleus. For $R_{gc}
< 10$ kpc the luminosities and the radii of clusters appear to be uncorrelated.
The Galaxy differs from the LMC and the SMC in that it appears to lack highly
flattened luminous clusters. Galactic globular clusters with ages $\geq$ 13.0
Gyr are all of Oosterhoff type II, whereas almost all of those with ages $<$
13.0 Gyr have been assigned to Oosterhoff type I. Globular clusters with ages
$<$11.5 Gyr are all located in the outer Galactic halo, have below-average
luminosities and above-average radii. On the other hand the very old globular
cluster NGC 6522 is situated close to the Galactic nucleus.

focus on studying the finite-size scaling of $\rho_{s1} 2L$ and $\rho_{s2} 2L$,
where $L$ stands for the spatial box size used in the simulations and
$\rho_{si}$ with $i \in \{1,2\}$ is the spin-stiffness in the $i$-direction.
Remarkably, while we do observe a large correction to scaling for the
observable $\rho_{s1}2L$ as proposed in \cite{Fritz11}, the data for
$\rho_{s2}2L$ exhibit a good scaling behavior without any indication of a large
correction. As a consequence, we are able to obtain a numerical value for the
critical exponent $\nu$ which is consistent with the known O(3) result with
moderate computational effort. Specifically, the numerical value of $\nu$ we
determine by fitting the data points of $\rho_{s2}2L$ to their expected scaling
form is given by $\nu=0.7120(16)$, which agrees quantitatively with the most
accurate known Monte Carlo O(3) result $\nu = 0.7112(5)$. Finally, while we can
also obtain a result of $\nu$ from the observable second Binder ratio $Q_2$

from $Q_2$ is more than twice as large as that of $\nu$ determined from

we detect variations in r band flux of overall amplitude between 0.22 mag and
0.92 mag in different sources. Eight of 18 SSRQs display a bluer-when-brighter
(BWB) trend. In contrast, the variability amplitude of 15 FSRQs in r band
ranges from 0.18 to 0.97 mag, and 11 of 15 sources show a BWB trend. We found
an anti-correlation between the Eddington ratio and the variability amplitude
in r band for SSRQs, which is similar to that in radio quiet AGNs. This implies
that the thermal emission from accretion disk may be responsible for the
variability in SSRQs, although the jet nonthermal emission cannot be excluded.
In contrast, there is no correlation in FSRQs, which implies that the
mechanisms of variability in FSRQs may be different from that in SSRQs. The
optical continuum variability of radio loud broad absorption line quasars
(BALQs) are investigated for the first time here on two sources with steep
radio spectrum. Both radio loud BALQs show variations with amplitude of about
0.3 mag at r band. Their spectral variability all show a BWB trend. In a
combined sample (18 SSRQs, and 44 FSRQs) of our sample with the FSRQs in Gu &
Ai (2011), we found a trend of a broader line width of broad Mg II emission

ion damage, which severely limits their usefulness for photonic structures. The
current work demonstrates that strategic etch removal of the most highly
defective material yields thin, single-crystal diamond membranes with strong
photoluminescence and a Raman signature approaching that of single-crystal bulk

fabrication of high-quality optical resonators.

proper and efficient functioning of the network. In the present study, we newly
define synchronization cost by the phase difference among the

minimized in a network topology with rich-club organization, which comprises
the densely-connected center nodes and peripheral nodes connecting with the
center module. We also show that the network topology is characterized by its
bimodal degree distribution, which is quantified by Wolfson's polarization

Sitter space-time proposed by Randall-Sundrum. We find that a test particle
moves in the bulk and is not restricted on a 3-brane (to be taken as our
universe). On the 3-brane, the test particle moves with uniform velocity,
giving the appearance that it is not subject to a force. But computing the
particle's energy using the energy-momentum tensor yields a time-dependent
energy that suggests a time-dependent mass. Thus, the extra force, which is the
effect of the warped extra dimension on the particle's motion on the 3-brane,
does not change the velocity but the mass of the particle. The particle's
motion in the bulk also results in a time-dependent modification of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle as viewed on the 3-brane. These two results
show that the classical physics along the extra dimension results in the
time-dependence of particle masses and the uncertainty principle. If the
particle masses are time-independent and the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
is to remain unchanged, then there must be a non-gravitational force that will
restrict all particles on the 3-brane. Finally, we just note that although
classically, these time-dependent corrections on the 3-brane can be removed,
quantum mechanical corrections along the extra dimension will restore back the
problem.

that the overstepping of Tsirelson's bound is due to violation of fair

sampling is violated. For a class of Bell-type inequalities generalized to
d-dimensional systems, we then consider what level of violation is required to

boundary condition. Each particle at a site hops to the next site with
probability $0 \leq p \leq 1$, if the next site is empty. This condition can be
rephrased by the condition that the number $n$ of vacant sites between the
particle and the next particle is positive. Then the average velocity is given
by a product of the hopping probability $p$ and the probability that $n \geq

zero-range process, it is proved that the distribution function of vacant sites
in the stationary state is exactly given by a factorized form. We define
$k$-particle velocity correlation function as the expectation value of a
product of velocities of $k$ particles in the stationary distribution. It is
shown that it does not depend on positions of $k$ particles on a circle but
depends only on the number $k$. We give explicit expressions for all velocity

interferometry experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), particularly
in the context of a proposed Heisenberg limited interferometry experiment. For
a relative phase eigenstate the fractional fluctuation in one spin operator

cosmological probes, the conventional spherical modeling of the intracluster

pressure) are very approximate at best. Extending our previous works, we
developed further a method to reconstruct for the first time the full
three-dimensional structure (triaxial shape and principal axis orientation) of
both DM and intracluster (IC) gas, and the level of non-thermal pressure of the
IC gas. We outline an application of our method to the galaxy cluster Abell
383, taken as part of the CLASH multi-cycle treasury program, presenting
results of a joint analysis of X-ray and strong lensing measurements. We find
that the intermediate-major and minor-major axis ratios of the DM are
0.71+/-0.10 and 0.55+/-0.06, respectively, and the major axis of the DM halo is
inclined with respect to the line of sight of 21.1+/-10.1 deg. The level of
non-thermal pressure has been evaluated to be about 10% of the total energy
budget. We discuss the implications of our method for the viability of the CDM
scenario, focusing on the concentration parameter C and the inner slope of the
DM gamma, since the cuspiness of dark-matter density profiles in the central
regions is one of the critical tests of the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm for
structure formation: we measure gamma=1.02+/-0.06 on scales down to 25 Kpc, and
C=4.76+/-0.51, values which are close to the predictions of the standard model,
and providing further evidences that support the CDM scenario. Our method
allows us to recover the three-dimensional physical properties of clusters in a
bias-free way, overcoming the limitations of the standard spherical modelling

that they deplete Li by different degrees during their pre-main sequence phase.
Beryllium abundances are complementary to the lithium ones, and can help
tracing the mixing processes in the stellar interiors. Our aim is to derive
beryllium abundances in a sample of G- and K-type stars of two young pre-main
sequence open clusters, IC 2391 and IC 2602. The Be abundances are used to
investigate the mixing of internal material in these stars. The reliability of
the Be lines as abundance indicators in low-temperatures is also investigated
in detail. We derived Be abundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise
UVES/VLT spectra using spectrum synthesis and model atmospheres. Atmospheric
parameters and other elemental abundances are adopted from a previous work. The
sample stars have masses in the range between 0.80 < M/Msun < 1.20. They have
been shown to differ in lithium abundance by about 0.60 dex, with lower A(Li)
in cooler and lower mass stars. Here, we find that all the stars have the same
Be abundance within the uncertainties. These observations show that the Be
abundance is not affected by the mixing events in the pre-main sequence, in
this mass range, in agreement with the expectation of evolutionary models. A
comparison with Be abundances in older clusters shows that, contrary to the
models, cool stars deplete Be during their main-sequence lifetime, confirming
what has been previously suggested in the literature.

constructed from the gauge-invariance requirement of the interaction
Lagrangians. These interactions play a crucial role in the quantum
hadrodynamical description of high-spin baryon resonances in hadronic
processes. We find that the power of the momentum dependence of a consistent
interaction rises with the spin of the fermion field. This leads to unphysical
structures in the energy dependence of the computed tree-level cross sections
when the short-distance physics is cut off with standard hadronic form factors.
A novel, spin-dependent hadronic form factor is proposed that suppresses the
unphysical artifacts.

Density (PSD) of this is typically fit by a phenomenological model of multiple
Lorentzians for both the broad band noise and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations
(QPOs). Our previous paper (Ingram & Done 2011) developed the first physical
model for the PSD and fit this to observational data. This was based on the
same truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which can explain the correlated
properties of the energy spectra. This assumes that the broad band noise is
from propagating fluctuations in mass accretion rate within the hot flow, while
the QPO is produced by global Lense-Thirring precession of the same hot flow.
  Here we develop this model, making some significant improvements. Firstly we
specify that the viscous frequency (equivalently, surface density) in the hot
flow has the same form as that measured from numerical simulations of
precessing, tilted accretion flows. Secondly, we refine the statistical
techniques which we use to fit the model to the data. We re-analyse the PSD
from the 1998 rise to outburst of XTE J1550-564 with our new model in order to
assess the impact of these changes. We find that the derived outer radii of the
hot flow (set by the inner radius of the truncated disc) are rather similar,
changing from ~68-13 Rg throughout the outburst rise. However, the more
physical assumptions of our new model also allow us to constrain the scale
height of the flow. This decreases as the outer radius of the flow decreases,
as expected from the spectral evolution. The spectrum steepens in response to
the increased cooling as the as the truncation radius sweeps in, so gas
pressure support for the flow decreases.
  The new model, propfluc, is publically available within the xspec spectral
fitting package.

In this article we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to infer
the signaling pathway based on the posterior distributions of parameters in the
model. Under this framework, we consider network sparsity and model the
existence of an association between two proteins both at the overall level
across all experiments and at each individual experimental level. This allows
us to infer the pairs of proteins that are associated with each other and their
causal relationships. We also explicitly consider both intrinsic noise and
measurement error. Markov chain Monte Carlo is implemented for statistical
inference. We demonstrate that this hierarchical modeling can effectively pool
information from different interventional experiments through simulation
studies and real data analysis.

Decimetre-size dust agglomerates mark a transition point in this growth

properties of decimetre-scale dusty bodies in protoplanetary discs. Small
sub-mm size dust aggregates consisting of micron-size SiO$_2$ particles
randomly interacted with dust targets of varying initial conditions in a
continuous sequence of independent collisions. Impact velocities were 7.7 m/s
on average and in the range expected for collisions with decimetre bodies in
protoplanetary discs. The targets all evolved by forming dust \emph{crusts}
with up to several cm thickness and a unique filling factor of 31% $\pm$3%. A
part of the projectiles sticks directly. In addition, some projectile fragments
slowly return to the target by gravity. All initially porous parts of the
surface, i.e. built from the slowly returning fragments, are compacted and
firmly attached to the underlying dust layers by the subsequent impacts. Growth
is possible at impact angles from 0$^{\circ}$ (central collision) to
70$^{\circ}$. No growth occurs at steeper dust surfaces. We measured the
velocity, angle, and size distribution of collision fragments. The average
restitution coefficient is 3.8% or 0.29 m/s ejection velocity. Ejecta sizes are
comparable to the projectile sizes. The high filling factor is close to the
most compact configuration of dust aggregates by local compression ($\sim
33$%). This implies that the history of the surface formation and target growth
is completely erased. In view of this, the filling factor of 31% seems to be a
universal value in the collision experiments of all self-consistently evolving
targets at the given impact velocities. We suggest that decimetre and probably
larger bodies can simply be characterised by one single filling factor.

determine the dust species present in the disc and different physical
parameters such as grain sizes, dust abundance ratios, and the dust and
continuum temperatures. Results. We find that all the discs are dominated by
emission features of crystalline and amorphous silicate dust. Only a few sample
sources show features due to CO2 gas or carbonaceous molecules such as PAHs and
C60 fullerenes. Our analysis shows that dust grain processing in these discs is
strong, resulting in large average grain sizes and a very high crystallinity
fraction. However, we do not find any correlations between the derived dust
parameters and properties of the central source. There also does not seem to be
a noticeable difference between the mineralogy of the Galactic and LMC sources.

adsorbates (CO molecules and O atoms) and defects on electronic structures and
transport properties of Au nanotubes (Au(5, 3) and Au(5, 5)). For CO
adsorption, various adsorption sites of CO on the Au tubes were considered. The
vibrational frequency of the CO molecule was found to be very different for two
nearly degenerate stable adsorption configurations of Au(5, 3), implying the
possibility of distinguishing these two configurations via measuring the
vibrational frequency of CO in experiments. After CO adsorption, the
conductance of Au(5, 3) decreases by 0.9G0 and the conductance of Au(5, 5)
decreases by approximately 0.5G0. For O-adsorbed Au tubes, O atoms strongly
interact with Au tubes, leading to around 2G0 of drop in conductance for both
Au tubes. These results may have implications for Au-tube-based chemical
sensing. When a monovacancy defect is present, we found that, for both tubes,
the conductance decreases by around 1G0. Another type of defect arising from
the adhesion of one Au atom is also considered. For this case, it is found
that, for the Au(5, 3) tube, the defect decreases the conductance by nearly
1G0, whereas for Au(5, 5), the decrease in conductance is only 0.3G0.

experiments will be ultimately limited by the broadband intensity modulation
that is intrinsic to the pulsar's stochastic radio signal. That is, as the peak
flux of the pulsar approaches that of the system equivalent flux density,
neither greater antenna gain nor increased instrumental bandwidth will improve
timing precision. These conclusions proceed from an analysis of the covariance
matrix used to characterise residual pulse profile fluctuations following the
template matching procedure for arrival time estimation. We perform such an
analysis on 25 hours of high-precision timing observations of the closest and
brightest millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. In these data, the standard
deviation of the post-fit arrival time residuals is approximately four times
greater than that predicted by considering the system equivalent flux density,
mean pulsar flux and the effective width of the pulsed emission. We develop a
technique based on principal component analysis to mitigate the effects of
shape variations on arrival time estimation and demonstrate its validity using
a number of illustrative simulations. When applied to our observations, the
method reduces arrival time residual noise by approximately 20%. We conclude
that, owing primarily to the intrinsic variability of the radio emission from
PSR J0437-4715 at 20 cm, timing precision in this observing band better than 30
- 40 ns in one hour is highly unlikely, regardless of future improvements in
antenna gain or instrumental bandwidth. We describe the intrinsic variability
of the pulsar signal as stochastic wideband impulse modulated self-noise
(SWIMS) and argue that SWIMS will likely limit the timing precision of every
millisecond pulsar currently observed by Pulsar Timing Array projects as larger
and more sensitive antennae are built in the coming decades.

calculated the GT strength distributions and electron capture rates for odd-odd
nucleus 50V by using the pn-QRPA theory. At present 50V is the first
experimentally available odd-odd nucleus in fp-shell nuclei. We also compare
our GT strength distribution with the recently measured results of a

calculations. One curious finding of the paper is that the Brink's hypothesis,
usually employed in large-scale shell model calculations, is not a good
approximation to use at least in the case of 50V. SNe Ia model calculations
performed using FFN rates result in overproduction of 50Ti, and were brought to
a much acceptable value by employing shell model results. It might be
interesting to study how the composition of the ejecta using presently reported

increase the performer's life expectancy? Previous studies of this issue have
suffered from healthy performer survivor bias, that is, candidates who are
healthier will be able to act in more films and have more chance to win Oscar
Awards. To correct this bias, we adapt Robins' rank preserving structural
accelerated failure time model and $g$-estimation method. We show in simulation
studies that this approach corrects the bias contained in previous studies. We
estimate that the effect of winning an Oscar Award on survival is 4.2 years,
with a 95% confidence interval of $[-0.4,8.4]$ years. There is not strong
evidence that winning an Oscar increases life expectancy.

recently being used for calculation of stellar weak interaction rates of

a pivotal role to decide if these stars would be crushed into black holes or
explode as supernovae. The product of abundance and positron capture rates on
$^{55}$Co is substantial and as such can play a role in fine tuning of input
parameters of simulation codes specially in the presupernova evolution.
Recently we introduced our calculation of capture rates on $^{55}$Co, in a
luxurious model space of $7 \hbar \omega$, employing the pn-QRPA theory with a
separable interaction. Simulators, however, may require these rates on a fine
scale. Here we present for the first time an expanded calculation of the
neutrino energy loss rates and positron capture rates on $^{55}$Co on an
extensive temperature-density scale. These type of scale is appropriate for
interpolation purposes and of greater utility for simulation codes. The pn-QRPA
calculated neutrino energy loss rates are enhanced roughly up to two orders of
magnitude compared with the large-scale shell model calculations and favor a
lower entropy for the core of massive stars.

can isolate the Sivers contribution and thereby study its process dependence.
The predictions for the Sivers asymmetry obtained with and without inclusion of

that both processes represent unique opportunities to discriminate among the
two approaches and test the universality properties of the Sivers function in

nonlinear function of the barrier process. In the one stochastic case, this
type of equations have been already studied by Ma and Wang. They called it as
""variant"" reflected BSDEs (VRBSDEs in short) based on the general version of
the Skorohod problem recently studied by Bank and El Karoui. Among others, Ma
and Wang showed that VRBSDEs is a novel tool for some problems in finance and
optimal stopping problems where no existing methods can be easily applicable.
Since more of those models have their stochastic counterpart, it is very useful
to transpose the work of Ma and Wang to doubly stochastic version. In doing so,
we firstly establish the stochastic variant Skorohod problem based on the
stochastic representation theorem, which extends the work of Bank and El
Karoui. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution for VRBDSDEs by
means of the contraction mapping theorem. By the way, we show the comparison

GOODS-Herschel program, we identify 21 infrared bright galaxies previously
missed in the deepest 24um surveys performed by MIPS. These MIPS dropouts are
predominantly found in two redshift bins, centred at z ~0.4 and ~1.3. Their
S_100/S_24 flux density ratios are similar to those of local LIRGs and ULIRGs,
whose silicate absorption features at 18um (at z ~ 0.4) and 9.7um (at z ~ 1.3)
are shifted into the 24um MIPS band at these redshifts. The high-z sub-sample
consists of 11 infrared luminous sources, accounting for ~2% of the whole
GOODS-Herschel sample and putting strong upper limits on the fraction of
LIRGs/ULIRGs at 1.0<z<1.7 that are missed by the 24um surveys. We find that a
S_100/S_24 > 43 colour cut selects galaxies with a redshift distribution
similar to that of the MIPS dropouts and when combined with a second colour
cut, S_16/S_8 > 4, isolates sources at 1.0 < z < 1.7. We show that these
sources have elevated specific star formation rates (sSFR) compared to main
sequence galaxies at these redshifts and are likely to be compact starbursts
with moderate/strong 9.7um silicate absorption features in their mid-IR
spectra. Herschel data reveal that their infrared luminosities extrapolated
from the 24um flux density are underestimated, on average, by a factor of ~3.
These silicate break galaxies account for 16% (8%) of the ULIRG (LIRG)
population in the GOODS fields, indicating a lower limit in their space density
of 2.0 \times 10^(-5) Mpc^(-3). Finally, we provide estimates of the fraction
of z < 2 MIPS dropout sources as a function of the 24-, 100-, 160-, 250- and
350um sensitivity limits, and conclude that previous predictions of a
population of silicate break galaxies missed by the major 24um extragalactic

using either an active or a passive source. Passive sources might be valuable
in some scenarios; for instance, in those experimental setups operating at high
transmission rates, since no externally driven element is required. Typical
passive transmitters involve parametric down-conversion. More recently, it has
been shown that phase-randomized coherent pulses also allow passive generation
of decoy states and Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) polarization signals, though
the combination of both setups in a single passive source is cumbersome. In
this paper, we present a complete passive transmitter that prepares decoy-state
BB84 signals using coherent light. Our method employs sum-frequency generation
together with linear optical components and classical photodetectors. In the
asymptotic limit of an infinite long experiment, the resulting secret key rate
(per pulse) is comparable to the one delivered by an active decoy-state BB84
setup with an infinite number of decoy settings.

The proposed modification of the conventional sum-rule techniques is assessed
by applying our prescriptions to quantum mechanics, where exact solutions may
be easily obtained by simply solving the Schr\""odinger equation. The very
striking similarity of the extraction procedures of bound-state parameters in
potential models and in QCD gives us great confidence in the reliability of our
improvements of the sum-rule formalism and their applicability to hadron
phenomenology. The implications of one's chosen definition of the heavy-quark
masses are scrutinized and the MS-bar quark-mass scheme is identified as the
optimal choice for our purposes. Our ideas turn out to reconcile QCD sum-rule
predictions for the charmed-meson decay constants (which before tended to be
markedly too low) with the findings of both lattice QCD and experiment.

anodes induced by lithium intercalation and deintercalation processes. Average
Raman spectra of graphitic anodes reveal that cycling at potentials that
correspond to low lithium concentrations in LixC (0 \leq x < 0.16) is
responsible for most of the structural damage observed at the graphite surface.
The extent of surface structural disorder in graphite is significantly reduced
for the anodes that were cycled at potentials where stage-1 and stage-2
compounds (x > 0.33) are present. Electrochemical impedance spectra show larger
interfacial impedance for the electrodes that were fully delithiated during
cycling as compared to electrodes that were cycled at lower potentials (U <
0.15 V vs. Li/Li+). Steep Li+ surface-bulk concentration gradients at the
surface of graphite during early stages of intercalation processes, and the
inherent increase of the LixC d-spacing tend to induce local stresses at the
edges of graphene layers, and lead to the breakage of C-C bonds. The exposed
graphite edge sites react with the electrolyte to (re)form the SEI layer, which
leads to gradual degradation of the graphite anode, and causes reversible
capacity loss in a lithium-ion battery.

GP condensate tends to spill all over the available volume the logarithmic one
tends to form a Gaussian-type droplet - even in the absence of an external

to acquire a finite size despite the bare particles being assumed point-like,
i.e., the spatial extent emerges here as a result of quantum many-body

the background density changes the topological structure of their momentum

of Hempel and Schaffner-Bielich (HS), which includes excluded volume effects
and relativistic mean-field (RMF) interactions. We consider the RMF
parameterizations TM1, TMA, and FSUgold. These EOS are implemented into our
spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model, which is based on general
relativistic radiation hydrodynamics and three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino
transport. The results obtained for the new EOS are compared with the widely
used EOS of H. Shen et al. and Lattimer & Swesty. The systematic comparison
shows that the model description of inhomogeneous nuclear matter is as
important as the parameterization of the nuclear interactions for the supernova
dynamics and the neutrino signal. Furthermore, several new aspects of nuclear
physics are investigated: the HS EOS contains distributions of nuclei,
including nuclear shell effects. The appearance of light nuclei, e.g.,
deuterium and tritium is also explored, which can become as abundant as alphas
and free protons. In addition, we investigate the black hole formation in
failed core-collapse supernovae, which is mainly determined by the high-density
EOS. We find that temperature effects lead to a systematically faster collapse
for the non-relativistic LS EOS in comparison to the RMF EOS. We deduce a new
correlation for the time until black hole formation, which allows to determine
the maximum mass of proto-neutron stars, if the neutrino signal from such a
failed supernova would be measured in the future. This would give a constraint
for the nuclear EOS at finite entropy, complementary to observations of cold
neutron stars.

some surprising nonlinear dynamics that can result from the competition between

selectively removed by a membrane or electrode, a ""desalination shock"" can
propagate through the microstructure, leaving in its wake an ultrapure

basic physics of desalination shocks and develop a mathematical theory of their
existence, structure, and stability, allowing for slow variations in surface
charge or channel geometry. Via asymptotic approximations and similarity
solutions, we show that desalination shocks accelerate and sharpen in narrowing
channels, while they decelerate and weaken, and sometimes disappear, in
widening channels. These phenomena may find applications in separations

perturbations of DE and since the evolution of DE is motivated by the dynamics
of a scalar field the homogenous and its perturbations can be used to determine
the form of the potential and the nature of Dark Energy. Since our

  Series), which took place from 11-15 April 2011 in Muonio, Finland. The

BL Lacertae object OJ287 at >14pc from the central supermassive black hole. We
employ data from multi-spectral range (total flux and linear polarization)
monitoring programs combined with sequences of ultra-high-resolution 7mm VLBA
images. The correlation between the brightest gamma-ray and mm flares is found
to be statistically significant. The two gamma-ray peaks, detected by
Fermi-LAT, that we report here happened at the rising phase of two
exceptionally bright mm flares accompanied by sharp linear polarization peaks.
The VLBA images show that these mm flares in total flux and polarization degree
occurred in a jet region at >14pc from the innermost jet region. The time
coincidence of the brighter gamma-ray flare and its corresponding mm linear
polarization peak evidences that both the gamma-ray and mm outbursts occur
>14pc from the central black hole. We find two sharp optical flares occurring
at the peak times of the two reported gamma-ray flares. This is interpreted as
the gamma-ray flares being produced by synchrotron self-Compton scattering of
optical photons from the flares triggered by the interaction of moving knots
with a stationary conical shock in the jet.

  arXiv:1010.3939",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of the paper is to show that the nowadays experimental data from
superallowed nuclear and neutron $\beta$ decays, and from leptonic and
semileptonic decays allow the finding of the most probable numerical form of
the KM matrix, as well as the determination of decay constants, $f_{P}$, and of
various form factors $f_+(q^2)$, by using a genuine implementation of unitarity
constraints. In particular this approach allows the determination of
semileptonic form factors that is illustrated on the existing data of
$D\rightarrow \pi l \nu$ and $D\rightarrow K l\nu$ decays.

  transvections","7 pages",,,,"math.GR math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $V$ denote a vector space over two-element field $\mathbb F_2$ with
finite positive dimension and endowed with a symplectic form $B.$ Let ${\rm
SL}(V)$ denote the special linear group of $V.$ Let $S$ denote a subset of $V.$
Define $Tv(S)$ as the subgroup of ${\rm SL}(V)$ generated by the transvections
with direction $\alpha$ for all $\alpha\in S.$ Define $G(S)$ as the graph whose
vertex set is $S$ and where $\alpha,\beta\in S$ are connected whenever
$B(\alpha,\beta)=1.$ A well-known theorem states that under the assumption that
$S$ spans $V,$ the following (i), (ii) are equivalent: (i) $Tv(S)$ is
isomorphic to a symmetric group. (ii) $G(S)$ is a claw-free block graph. We
give an example which shows that this theorem is not true. We give a
modification of this theorem as follows. Assume that $S$ is a linearly
independent set of $V$ and no element of $S$ is in the radical of $V.$ Then the
above (i), (ii) are equivalent.
