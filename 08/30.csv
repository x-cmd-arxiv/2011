plasma is performed. A general expression for the neutrino self-energy operator
is obtained in the case of ultra-high energies when the local limit of the weak
interaction is not valid. The neutrino and antineutrino additional energy in
plasma is calculated using the dependence of the $W$ and $Z$--boson propagators
on the momentum transferred. The kinematical region for the neutrino radiative
transition (the so-called ""neutrino spin light"") is established for some
important astrophysical cases. For high energy neutrino and antineutrino,
dominating transition channels in plasma, $\nu_e + e^+ \to W^+$, $\bar\nu_e +
e^- \to W^-$ and $\bar\nu_{\ell} + \nu_{\ell} \to Z$, are indicated.

numerical software systems, and puts forward software verification as an
important application of control and systems theory. The idea is to transfer
Lyapunov functions and the associated computational techniques from control
systems analysis and convex optimization to verification of various software
safety and performance specifications. These include but are not limited to
absence of overflow, absence of division-by-zero, termination in finite time,
presence of dead-code, and certain user-specified assertions. Central to this
framework are Lyapunov invariants. These are properly constructed functions of
the program variables, and satisfy certain properties-resembling those of
Lyapunov functions-along the execution trace. The search for the invariants can
be formulated as a convex optimization problem. If the associated optimization
problem is feasible, the result is a certificate for the specification.

classified as a Neptune-size transiting-planet candidate on a relatively wide
orbit of 36.3 days. Follow-up observations were performed with UVES, Sandiford,
SOPHIE and HARPS. These observations revealed a faint companion in the spectra.
To find the true nature of the system we derived the radial velocities of the
faint companion using TODMOR - a two-dimensional correlation technique, applied
to the SOPHIE spectra. Modeling the lightcurve with EBAS we discovered a
secondary eclipse with a depth of ~0.07%, indicating a diluted eclipsing
binary. Combined MCMC modeling of the lightcurve and the radial velocities
suggested that CoRoT LRa02_E2_0121 is a hierarchical triple system with an
evolved G-type primary and an A-type:F-type grazing eclipsing binary. Such
triple systems are difficult to discover.

enables us to view them in Weinstock normal form, i.e. $P_0=\mathbb{R}^2$ and
$P_j=M(A_j):=(A_j+i\mathbb{I})\mathbb{R}^2$, $j=1,...,N$, where each $A_j$ is a
$2\times 2$ matrix with real entries. Weinstock has solved the problem
completely for N=1 (in fact, for pairs of transverse, maximally totally-real
subspaces in $\mathbb{C}^n\, \forall n\geq 2$). Using a characterization of
simultaneous triangularizability of $2\times 2$ matrices over the reals, given

typical barred disk galaxy by calculating the local spatial diffusion
coefficient and diffusion time-scale for bulge-disk-halo N-body self-consistent
systems which initially differ in the Safronov-Toomre-Q_T parameter. We find
different diffusion scenarios that depend on the bar strength and on the degree
of instability of the disk. Marginally stable disks, with Q_T \sim 1, have two
families of bar orbits with different values of angular momentum and energy,
which determine a large diffusion in the corotation region. In hot disks, Q_T>
1, stellar diffusion is reduced with respect to the case of marginally stable
disks. In cold models, we find that spatial diffusion is not constant in time
and strongly depends on the activity of the bar, which can move stars all over
the disk recurrently. We conclude that to realistically study the impact of
radial migration on the chemical evolution modeling of the Milky Way the role
of the bar has to be taken into account.

chopping a flat mirror and transferring image with an ellipse mirror, and
chopping a flat mirror and transferring image with a pair of face-to-face
paraboloid mirrors. The system analysis shows that chopping a flat mirror and
using a well aligned pair of paraboloids can generate the required field of
view for the MUSTUNG detector system, while other systems all suffer from
larger off-axis aberrations added by the system modification. The spot diagrams
of the well aligned pair of paraboloids produced is only about one Airy disk

the near-threshold resonance X(3872) charmonium state, which is assumed to be
formed by nonperturbative $D\bar D^*$ dynamics. It is demonstrated that, as
compared to the naive static-pions approximation, the imaginary parts that
originate from the inclusion of dynamical pions reduce substantially the width
from the $D\bar{D}\pi$ intermediate state. In particular, for a resonance
peaked at 0.5 MeV below the $D^0\bar D^{*0}$ threshold, this contribution to
the width is reduced by about a factor of 2, and the effect of the pion
dynamics on the width grows as long as the resonance is shifted towards the
$D^0\bar{D^0}\pi^0$ threshold. Although the physical width of the $X$ is
dominated by inelastic channels, our finding should still be of importance for
the $X$ line shapes in the $D\bar{D}\pi$ channel below $D{\bar D}^*$ threshold.
For example, in the scattering length approximation, the imaginary part of the
scattering length includes effects of all the pion dynamics and does not only
stem from the $D^*$ width. Meanwhile, we find that another important quantity
for the $X$ phenomenology, the residue at the $X$ pole, is weakly sensitive to
dynamical pions. In particular, we find that the binding energy dependence of
this quantity from the full calculation is close to that found from a model
with pointlike $D\bar D^*$ interactions only, consistent with earlier claims.
Coupled-channel effects (inclusion of the charged $D\bar{D}^*$ channel) turn
out to have a moderate impact on the results.

Be star disks is systematically studied for a wide range of Be star spectral
types and rotation rates. Gravitational darkening causes a reduction of the
stellar effective temperature towards the equator and a redirection of energy
towards the poles. It is an important physical effect in these star-disk
systems because the photoionizing radiation from the central B star is the main
energy source for the disk. We have added gravitational darkening to the bedisk
code to produce circumstellar disk models that include both the variation in
the effective temperature with latitude and the non-spherical shape of the star
in the calculation of the stellar photoionizing radiation field. The effect of
gravitational darkening on global measures of disk temperature is generally
significant for rotation rates above 80% of critical rotation. For example, a
B0V model rotating at 95% of critical has a density-averaged disk temperature
\approx 2500 K cooler than its nonrotating counterpart. However, detailed
differences in the temperature structure of disks surrounding rotating and
non-rotating stars reveal a complex pattern of heating and cooling. Spherical
gravitational darkening, an approximation that ignores the changing shape of
the star, gives good results for disk temperatures for rotation rates less than
\approx 80% of critical. However for the highest rotation rates, the distortion
of the stellar surface caused by rotation becomes important.

entanglement manifest themselves. When there are two players, it is well known
that the bias --- the maximum advantage over random play --- of entangled
players can be at most a constant times greater than that of classical players.
Recently, P\'{e}rez-Garc\'{i}a et al. [Comm. Math. Phys. 279 (2), 2008] showed
that no such bound holds when there are three or more players: the advantage of
entangled players over classical players can become unbounded, and scale with
the number of questions in the game. Their proof relies on non-trivial results
from operator space theory, and gives a non-explicit existence proof, leading
to a game with a very large number of questions and only a loose control over
the local dimension of the players' shared entanglement.
  We give a new, simple and explicit (though still probabilistic) construction
of a family of three-player XOR games which achieve a large quantum-classical
gap (QC-gap). This QC-gap is exponentially larger than the one given by
P\'{e}rez-Garc\'{i}a et. al. in terms of the size of the game, achieving a
QC-gap of order $\sqrt{N}$ with $N^2$ questions per player. In terms of the
dimension of the entangled state required, we achieve the same (optimal) QC-gap
of $\sqrt{N}$ for a state of local dimension $N$ per player. Moreover, the
optimal entangled strategy is very simple, involving observables defined by
tensor products of the Pauli matrices.
  Additionally, we give the first upper bound on the maximal QC-gap in terms of
the number of questions per player, showing that our construction is only
quadratically off in that respect. Our results rely on probabilistic estimates
on the norm of random matrices and higher-order tensors which may be of
independent interest.

Wannier basis is equivalent to the triviality of the so-called Bloch bundle, a
rank m hermitian vector bundle over the Brillouin zone, we prove that magnetic
time-reversal symmetry is sufficient to ensure the triviality of the Bloch

Wannier basis exists provided that the trace per unit volume of a suitable
function of the Fermi projection vanishes. For d>4 and d \leq 2m (stable rank
regime) only the exponential localization of a subset of Wannier functions is
shown; this improves part of the analysis of [Kuc09]. Finally, for d>4 and d>2m

suffice in order to prove trivility and thus exponential localization.

  unitary invariant diagonal $N$-representability conditions",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variational calculation of the ground state energy and its properties using
the second-order reduced density matrix (2-RDM) is a promising approach for
quantum chemistry. A major obstacle with this approach is that the
$N$-representability conditions are too difficult in general. Therefore, we
usually employ some approximations such as the $P$, $Q$, $G$, $T1$ and
$T2^\prime$ conditions, for realistic calculations. The results of using these
approximations and conditions in 2-RDM are comparable to those of CCSD(T).
However, these conditions do not incorporate an important property;
size-consistency. Size-consistency requires that energies $E(A)$, $E(B)$ and
$E(A...B)$ for two infinitely separated systems $A$, $B$, and their respective
combined system $A...B$, to satisfy $E(A...B) = E(A) + E(B)$. In this study, we
show that the size-consistency can be satisfied if 2-RDM satisfies the
following conditions: (i) 2-RDM is unitary invariant diagonal
$N$-representable; (ii) 2-RDM corresponding to each subsystem is the eigenstate
of the number of corresponding electrons; and (iii) 2-RDM satisfies at least
one of the $ P$, $Q$, $G$, $T1$ and $T2^\prime$ conditions.

of important subclasses of valuation functions that express
no-complementarities. Our main results concern their approximate learnability
in the distributional learning (PAC-style) setting. We provide nearly tight
lower and upper bounds of $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{1/2})$ on the approximation factor
for learning XOS and subadditive valuations, both widely studied superclasses
of submodular valuations. Interestingly, we show that the
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2})$ lower bound can be circumvented for XOS functions of
polynomial complexity; we provide an algorithm for learning the class of XOS
valuations with a representation of polynomial size achieving an $O(n^{\eps})$
approximation factor in time $O(n^{1/\eps})$ for any $\eps > 0$. This
highlights the importance of considering the complexity of the target function
for polynomial time learning. We also provide new learning results for
interesting subclasses of submodular functions.
  Our upper bounds for distributional learning leverage novel structural
results for all these valuation classes. We show that many of these results
provide new learnability results in the Goemans et al. model (SODA 2009) of
approximate learning everywhere via value queries.
  We also introduce a new model that is more realistic in economic settings, in
which the learner can set prices and observe purchase decisions at these prices
rather than observing the valuation function directly. In this model, most of
our upper bounds continue to hold despite the fact that the learner receives
less information (both for learning in the distributional setting and with
value queries), while our lower bounds naturally extend.

experimentally obtained data. In a dusty plasma experiment, micron-size dust
particles are introduced into a partially-ionized argon plasma, where they
become negatively charged. They are electrically levitated to form a
single-layer Wigner crystal, which is subsequently melted using laser heating.
In the liquid phase, these dust particles experience interparticle electric
repulsion, laser heating, and friction from the ambient neutral argon gas, and
they can be considered to be in a nonequilibrium steady state. Direct
measurements of the positions and velocities of individual dust particles are
then used to obtain a time series for an off-diagonal element of the stress
tensor and its time autocorrelation function. This calculation also requires
the interparticle potential, which was not measured experimentally, but was
obtained using a Debye-H\""{u}ckel-type model with experimentally determined
parameters. Integrating the autocorrelation function over time yields the
viscosity for shearing motion amongst dust particles. The viscosity so obtained
is found to agree with results from a previous experiment using a
hydrodynamical Navier-Stokes equation. This comparison serves as a test of the
Green-Kubo relation for viscosity. Our result is also compared to the
predictions of several simulations.

of a potential landscape and curl flux (current). The fluctuation-dissipation
theorem (FDT) is often applied to near equilibrium systems with detailed
balance. The response due to a small perturbation can be expressed by a
spontaneous fluctuation. For non-equilibrium systems, we derived a generalized
FDT that the response function is composed of two parts: (1) a spontaneous
correlation representing the relaxation which is present in the near
equilibrium systems with detailed balance; (2) a correlation related to the
persistence of the curl flux in steady state, which is also in part linked to a
internal curvature of a gauge field. The generalized FDT is also related to the
fluctuation theorem. In the equal time limit, the generalized FDT naturally
leads to non-equilibrium thermodynamics where the entropy production rate can
be decomposed into spontaneous relaxation driven by gradient force and house

measurements of 150 nearby stars to a model based on Kepler candidate planet
radii and a power-law mass-radius relation. Our analysis is based on the
presumption that the planet populations around the two sets of stars are the
same. The model can reproduce the observed distribution of radial velocity
variation over a range of parameter values, but, for the expected level of
Doppler systematic error, the highest Kolmogorov-Smirnov probabilities occur
for a power-law index alpha ~ 4, indicating that rocky-metal planets dominate
the planet population in this size range. A single population of gas-rich,
low-density planets with alpha = 2 is ruled out unless our Doppler errors are
>= 5m/s, i.e., much larger than expected based on observations and stellar
chromospheric emission. If small planets are a mix of gamma rocky planets
(alpha = 3.85) and 1-gamma gas-rich planets (alpha = 2), then gamma > 0.5
unless Doppler errors are >=4 m/s. Our comparison also suggests that Kepler's
detection efficiency relative to ideal calculations is less than unity. One
possible source of incompleteness is target stars that are misclassified
subgiants or giants, for which the transits of small planets would be
impossible to detect. Our results are robust to systematic effects, and
plausible errors in the estimated radii of Kepler stars have only moderate
impact.

fractionation, and ionisation in a sample of seven massive clumps associated
with IRDCs. The APEX telescope was used to observe the C17O(2-1), H13CO+(3-2),
DCO+(3-2), N2H+(3-2), and N2D+(3-2) transitions towards the clumps. The CO
molecules do not appear to be significantly depleted in the observed clumps.
The DCO+/HCO+ and N2D+/N2H+ column density ratios are about 0.0002-0.014 and
0.002-0.028, respectively. The former ratio is found to decrease as a function
of gas kinetic temperature. A simple chemical analysis suggests that the lower
limit to the ionisation degree is in the range x(e)~10^{-8}-10^{-7}, whereas
the estimated upper limits range from a few 10^{-6} up to ~10^{-4}. Lower
limits to x(e) imply the cosmic-ray ionisation rate of H2 to lie between
zeta_H2~10^{-17}-10^{-15} s^{-1}. These are the first estimates of x(e) and
zeta_H2 towards massive IRDCs reported so far. The finding that CO is not
depleted in the observed sources conforms to the fact that they show evidence
of star formation activity which is believed to release CO from the icy grain
mantles back into the gas phase. The observed degree of deuteration is lower
than in low-mass starless cores and protostellar envelopes. Decreasing
deuteration with increasing temperature is likely to reflect the clump
evolution. On the other hand, the association with young high-mass stars could
enhance zeta_H2 and x(e) above the levels usually found in low-mass
star-forming regions. On the scale probed by our observations, ambipolar
diffusion cannot be a main driver of clump evolution unless it occurs on
timescales >>10^6 yr.

taking into account the effect of the bulk viscosity. We analyze the evolution
of the quantities relevant for the physical description of the early universe,
namely, the energy density $\rho$, temperature $T$, Hubble parameter $H$ and
scale factor $a$ before, during and after the phase transition. To study the
cosmological dynamics and the time evolution we use both analytical and
numerical methods. By assuming that the phase transition may be described by an
effective nucleation theory (prompt {\it first-order} phase transition), we
also consider the case where the universe evolved through a mixed phase with a
small initial supercooling and monotonically growing hadronic bubbles. The
numerical estimation of the cosmological parameters, $a$ and $H$ for instance,
makes it clear that the time evolution varies from phase to phase. As the QCD
era turns to be fairly accessible in the high-energy experiments and the
lattice QCD simulations, the QCD equation of state is very well defined. In
light of this, we introduce a systematic study of the {\it cross-over}

identify clouds as regions of connected CO emission, and find that the
distributions of cloud sizes, fluxes and masses are sensitive to the choice of
decomposition parameters. In all cases, however, the luminosity function of CO
clouds is steeper than dN/dL \propto L^{-2}, suggesting that a substantial
fraction of mass is in low-mass clouds. A correlation between size and
linewidth, while apparent for the largest emission structures, breaks down when
those structures are decomposed into smaller structures. We argue that the
correlation between virial mass and CO luminosity is the result of comparing
two covariant quantities, with the correlation appearing tighter on larger
scales where a size-linewidth relation holds. The virial parameter (the ratio
of a cloud's kinetic to self-gravitational energy) shows a wide range of values
and exhibits no clear trends with the CO luminosity or the likelihood of
hosting young stellar object (YSO) candidates, casting further doubt on the
assumption of virialization for molecular clouds in the LMC. Higher CO
luminosity increases the likelihood of a cloud harboring a YSO candidate, and
more luminous YSOs are more likely to be coincident with detectable CO
emission, confirming the close link between giant molecular clouds and massive
star formation.

frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in 3+1 physical
space-time, thus providing a compelling physical interpretation of the AdS/CFT
correspondence principle and AdS/QCD, a useful framework which describes the
correspondence between theories in a modified AdS$_5$ background and confining
field theories in physical space-time. To a first semiclassical approximation,
where quantum loops and quark masses are not included, this approach leads to a
single-variable light-front Schr\""odinger equation which determines the
eigenspectrum and the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and
orbital angular momentum. The coordinate $z$ in AdS space is uniquely
identified with a Lorentz-invariant coordinate $\zeta$ which measures the
separation of the constituents within a hadron at equal light-front time. The
internal structure of hadrons is explicitly introduced and the angular momentum
of the constituents plays a key role. We give an overview of the light-front
holographic approach to strongly coupled QCD. In particular, we study the
photon-to-meson transition form factors (TFFs) $F_{M \gamma}(Q^2)$ for $\gamma
\gamma^* \to M$ using light-front holographic methods. The results for the TFFs
for the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ mesons are also presented. Some novel features
of QCD are discussed, including the consequences of confinement for quark and
gluon condensates. A method for computing the hadronization of quark and gluon
jets at the amplitude level is outlined.

among economic agents in order to obtain a stable or equilibrium distribution
of wealth among the agents. In particular, a plain analogy compares the wealth
in a society with the energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents
to the energy exchange between molecules during collisions. In physical
systems, the energy exchange among molecules leads to a state of equipartition
of the energy and to an equilibrium situation where the entropy is a maximum.
On the other hand, in the majority of exchange models, the system converges to
a very unequal condensed state, where one or a few agents concentrate all the
wealth of the society while the wide majority of agents shares zero or almost
zero fraction of the wealth. So, in those economic systems a minimum entropy
state is attained. We propose here an analytical model where we investigate the
effects of a particular class of economic exchanges that minimize the entropy.
By solving the model we discuss the conditions that can drive the system to a
state of minimum entropy, as well as the mechanisms to recover a kind of

those obtained by imposing the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction or the
generalized Koopmans' condition, become orbital dependent or orbital-density
dependent, and provide a very promising avenue to go beyond density-functional
theory, especially when studying electronic, optical and dielectric properties,
charge-transfer excitations, and molecular dissociations. Unlike conventional
density functionals, these functionals are not invariant under unitary
transformations of occupied electronic states, which leave the total charge
density intact, and this added complexity has greatly inhibited both their
development and their practical applicability. Here, we first recast the
minimization problem for non-unitary invariant energy functionals into the
language of ensemble density-functional theory, decoupling the variational
search into an inner loop of unitary transformations that minimize the energy
at fixed orbital subspace, and an outer-loop evolution of the orbitals in the
space orthogonal to the occupied manifold. Then, we show that the potential
energy surface in the inner loop is far from convex parabolic in the early
stages of the minimization and hence minimization schemes based on these
assumptions are unstable, and present an approach to overcome such difficulty.
The overall formulation allows for a stable, robust, and efficient variational
minimization of non-unitary-invariant functionals, essential to study complex
materials and molecules, and to investigate the bulk thermodynamic limit, where
orbitals converge typically to localized Wannier functions. In particular,
using maximally localized Wannier functions as an initial guess can greatly
reduce the computational costs needed to reach the energy minimum while not
affecting or improving the convergence efficiency.

In fact, entropy squeezing, which occurs in position, will be compensated for
by an increase in momentum entropy, such that the BBM inequality is guaranteed.

observations and assumed in recent models implies that the efficiency with
which galaxies convert their gas into stars depends on gas metallicity. This is
because the abundance of molecular hydrogen is sensitive to the abundance of
dust, which catalyzes the formation of H_2 and helps to shield it from
dissociating radiation. In this study we point out that in the absence of
significant pre-enrichment by Population III stars forming out of zero
metallicity gas, such H_2-based star formation is expected to leave an imprint
in the form of bi-modality in the metallicity distribution among dwarf galaxies
and in the metallicity distribution of stars within individual galaxies. The
bi-modality arises because when gas metallicity (and dust abundance) is low,
formation of molecular gas is inefficient, the gas consumption time scale is
long, and star formation and metal enrichment proceed slowly. When metallicity
reaches a critical threshold value star formation and enrichment accelerate,
which leads to rapid increase in both stellar mass and metallicity of galaxies.
We demonstrate this process both using a simple analytical model and full
cosmological simulations. In contrast, observed metallicity distributions of
dwarf galaxies or stars within them are not bi-modal. We argue that this
discrepancy points to substantial early stochastic pre-enrichment by population
III stars to levels Z ~ 0.01 Z_sun in dense, star forming regions of early
galaxies.

spectroscopy of objects matched to X-ray point sources confirms a total of 27
AGN within the five structures, and we find that their host galaxies tend to be
located away from dense cluster cores. More than 36% of host galaxies are
located in the `green valley', which suggests they are a transitional
population. Based on analysis of OII and Hd line strengths, the average
spectral properties of the AGN host galaxies in all structures indicate either
on-going star formation or a starburst within ~ 1 Gyr, and the host galaxies
are younger than the average galaxy in the parent population. These results
indicate a clear connection between starburst and nuclear activity. We use
composite spectra of the spectroscopically confirmed members in each structure
to separate them based on a measure of the overall evolutionary state of their
constituent galaxies. We define structures as having more evolved populations
if their average galaxy has lower EW(OII) and EW(Hd). The AGN in the more
evolved structures have lower rest-frame 0.5-8 keV X-ray luminosities (all
below 10^43.3 erg s^-1) and longer times since a starburst than those in the
less evolved structures, suggesting that the peak of both star formation and

use a collection of several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations to study the halo contraction effect in systems ranging from dwarf
galaxies to clusters of galaxies, at high and low redshift. The simulations are
run by different groups with different codes and include hierarchical merging,
gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback. We show that in all our
cases the inner dark matter density increases relative to the matching
simulation without baryon dissipation, at least by a factor of several. The
strength of the contraction effect varies from system to system and cannot be
reduced to a simple prescription. We present a revised analytical model that
describes the contracted mass profile to an rms accuracy of about 10%. The
model can be used to effectively bracket the response of the dark matter halo
to baryon dissipation. The halo contraction effect is real and must be included
in modeling of the mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

[arXiv:1107.2177v1] proposed a method for the control of complex networks with
nonlinear dynamics based on linearizing the system around a finite number of
local desired states. The authors purport that any bidirectional network with
one-dimensional intrinsic node dynamics can be fully controlled by a single
driver node, which can be any node in the network, regardless of the network
topology. According to this result, a network with an arbitrarily large number
of nodes (a million, a billion, or even more) could be controlled by a single
node. Here we show, however, that this result is specious and that it does not
hold true even for networks with only two nodes. We demonstrate that the
erroneous results are a consequence of a fundamental flaw in the proposed
method, namely, that reaching a local desired state using the proposed
linearization procedure generally requires a nonlocal trajectory, which grossly
violates the linear approximation. Their further conclusion that network
systems with nonlinear dynamics are more controllable than those with linear
dynamics is a known fact presented as novel based on a flawed argument. A
central problem underlying the authors' argument is that their formulation is
entirely based on the number of driver nodes required to reach a desired
state---even when this number is one, keeping the system at that desired state
generally requires directly controlling all nodes in the network. When this is
taken into account, the conclusion that nonlinear dynamics can facilitate
network control was already anticipated in S.P. Cornelius, W.L. Kath & A.E.

sector is localized on a small cycle whose volume is stabilized by the D-term
potential of the U(1)_A. Since it obtains SUSY breaking mass regardless of the
detailed form of K\""ahler potential, the U(1)_A vector superfield acts as a
messenger mediating the SUSY breaking in the moduli sector to the MSSM sector.
Then, through the loops of U(1)_A vector superfield, there arise soft masses of
the order of m_{3/2}^2/8\pi^2 for scalar mass squares, m_{3/2}/(8\pi^2)^2 for
gaugino masses, and m_{3/2}/8\pi^2 for A-paramteres. In addition, the massive
U(1)_A vector superfield can have non-zero F and D-components through the
moduli mixing in the K\""ahler potential, and this can result in larger soft
masses depending upon the details of the moduli mixing. For instance, in the
presence of one-loop induced moduli mixing between the visible sector modulus
and the large volume modulus, the U(1)_A D-term provides soft scalar mass
squares of the order of m_{3/2}^2. However, if the visible sector modulus is
mixed only with small cycle moduli, its effect on soft terms depends on how to
stabilize the small cycle moduli.

homeomorphism fixing a puncture p of F. The mapping torus M = M_\phi is
hyperbolic and contains a maximal cusp C about the puncture p.
  We show that the area (and height) of the cusp torus bounding C is equal to
the stable translation distance of \phi acting on the arc complex A(F,p), up to
an explicitly bounded multiplicative error. Our proof relies on elementary
facts about the hyperbolic geometry of pleated surfaces. In particular, the
proof of this theorem does not use any deep results in Teichmueller theory,
Kleinian group theory, or the coarse geometry of A(F,p).
  A similar result holds for quasi-Fuchsian manifolds N = (F x R). In that
setting, we find a combinatorial estimate for the area (and height) of the cusp
annulus in the convex core of N, up to an explicitly bounded multiplicative and
additive error. As an application, we show that covers of punctured surfaces
induce quasi-isometric embeddings of arc complexes.

Mass-loss, occurring through radiation driven supersonic winds, is a
key issue throughout the evolution of massive stars. Two outstanding problems
are currently challenging the theory of radiation-driven winds: wind clumping
and the weak-wind problem. Aims. We seek to obtain accurate mass-loss rates of
OB stars at different evolutionary stages to constrain the impact of both
problems in our current understanding of massive star winds. Methods. We
perform a multi-wavelength quantitative analysis of a sample of ten Galactic
OB-stars by means of the atmospheric code CMFGEN, with special emphasis on the
L-band window. A detailed investigation is carried out on the potential of
Br\alpha\ and Pf\gamma\ as mass-loss and clumping diagnostics. Results. For
objects with dense winds, Br\alpha\ samples the intermediate wind while
Pf\gamma\ maps the inner one. In combination with other indicators (UV,
H\alpha, Br\gamma) these lines enable us to constrain the wind clumping
structure and to obtain ""true"" mass-loss rates. For objects with weak winds,
Br\alpha\ emerges as a reliable diagnostic tool to constrain the mass-loss
rates. The emission component at the line Doppler-core superimposed on the
rather shallow Stark absorption wings reacts very sensitively to mass loss
already at very low mass-loss values. On the other hand, the line wings display
similar sensitivity to mass loss as H\alpha, the classical optical mass loss
diagnostics. Conclusions. Our investigation reveals the great diagnostic
potential of L-band spectroscopy to derive clumping properties and mass-loss
rates of hot star winds. We are confident that Br\alpha\ will become the
primary diagnostic tool to measure very low mass-loss rates with unprecedented
accuracy

J1023+0038. The X-ray emission from the system exhibits highly significant
(12.5 sigma) large-amplitude (factor of 2-3) orbital variability over the five
consecutive orbits covered by the observation, with a pronounced decline in the
flux at all energies at superior conjunction. This can be naturally explained
by a partial geometric occultation by the secondary star of an X-ray--emitting
intrabinary shock, produced by the interaction of outflows from the two stars.
The depth and duration of the eclipse imply that the intrabinary shock is
localized near or at the surface of the companion star and close to the inner
Lagrangian point. The energetics of the shock favor a magnetically dominated
pulsar wind that is focused into the orbital plane, requiring close alignment
of the pulsar spin and orbital angular momentum axes. The X-ray spectrum
consists of a dominant non-thermal component and at least one thermal
component, likely originating from the heated pulsar polar caps, although a
portion of this emission may be from an optically-thin ""corona"". We find no
evidence for extended emission due to a pulsar wind nebula or bow shock down to
a limiting luminosity of L_X<3.6x10^29 ergs s^-1 (0.3-8 keV), <7x10^-6 of the

prescribed dynamical model in such a way that the output of the model (usually
some function of the model states) follows a given time series of observations.
Typically though, these two requirements cannot both be met at the same
time--tracking the observations is not possible without the trajectory
deviating from the proposed model equations, while adherence to the model
requires deviations from the observations. Thus, data assimilation faces a
trade-off. In this contribution, the sensitivity of the data assimilation with
respect to perturbations in the observations is identified as the parameter
which controls the trade-off. A relation between the sensitivity and the
out-of-sample error is established which allows to calculate the latter under
operational conditions. A minimum out-of-sample error is proposed as a
criterion to set an appropriate sensitivity and to settle the discussed
trade-off. Two approaches to data assimilation are considered, namely
variational data assimilation and Newtonian nudging, aka synchronisation.
Numerical examples demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

show that the dissipation in the external clocking circuit can always be
reduced asymptotically to zero using increasingly slow adiabatic clocking, such

trapping effects in the framework of the simple model of the internal spacetime
with uniform distribution of energy density, and external spacetime described
by the Reissner-Nordstr\""om geometry characterized by the braneworld ""tidal""
parameter $b$. For $b < 0$ the external spacetime is of the black-hole type,
while for $b > 0$ the external spacetime can be of both black-hole and
naked-singularity type. Then the ECS surface radius $R$ can be located also
above the unstable (outer) photon circular orbit. Such basically new types of
the spacetimes strongly alter the trapping phenomena as compared to the
standard case of $b = 0$. It is shown that the neutrino trapping effects are
slightly lowered by the presence of physically more plausible case of $b < 0$,
as compared to the standard internal Schwarzschild spacetime, while they can be
magnified by positive tidal charges if $b < 1$ and lowered for $b > 1$.
However, potential astrophysical relevance of the trapping phenomena is
strongly enhanced for negative tidal charges enabling a significant enlargement
of the ECS surface radius to values coherent with recent observations.

the context of the possible solution of food (waste) rescue and redistribution.
To this end, we develop an empirical model that can be used in Monte Carlo
simulations to study the dynamics of the underlying problem. Our model's
parameters are derived from a unique data set provided by a large food bank and
food rescue organization in north central Colorado. We find that food supply is
a non-parametric heavy-tailed process that is well-modeled with an extreme
value peaks-over-threshold model. Although the underlying process is
stochastic, the basic approach of food rescue and redistribution appears to be
feasible both at small and large scales. The ultimate efficacy of this model is
intimately tied to the rate at which food expires and hence the ability to
preserve and quickly transport and redistribute food. The cost of the
redistribution is tied to the number and density of participating suppliers,
and costs can be reduced (and supply increased) simply by recruiting additional
donors to participate. Our results show that with sufficient funding and
manpower, a significant amount of food can be rescued from the waste stream and
used to feed the hungry.

Gemini South with GMOS to acquire H-alpha images necessary to detect
star-forming regions in the two galaxy samples. We then performed long-slit

properties. Finally, we employed the VLT with HAWK-I to observe all galaxies in
the K' band to derive their main physical properties. We studied the morphology
of our two samples, finding five objects in Fornax and six in Hydra with
structures consistent with those of star-forming dwarfs, i.e., dwarf irregulars
(dIs) or blue compact dwarfs (BCDs). About four other objects are probably
dwarf spirals, while three objects remained undetected in both visible and near
infrared. On the basis of visible bright emission lines, we derived oxygen
abundances for ten star-forming candidates with values between 8.00 and 8.78.
Most fundamental properties of star-forming galaxies in Fornax and Hydra appear

arbitrary degree. While polynomial root finding continues to be one of the
fundamental tasks of computing, with essential use in all areas of theoretical
mathematics, numerics, computer graphics and physics, known methods have either
excellent theoretical complexity but cannot be used in practice, or are
practically efficient but are a lacking a successful theory behind them.
  In this manuscript we describe the theoretical complexity of Newton's method
for finding all roots of polynomials of given degree and show that it is
near-optimal for the known set of starting points that find all roots. This
theoretical result is complemented by a recent implementation of Newton's
method that finds all roots of various polynomials of degree more than a
million, significantly faster than our upper bounds on the complexity indicate,
and often much faster than established fast root finders. In some experiments,
it was possible to find all roots even with complexity $O(d\log d)$ for degrees
exceeding 100 million. Newton's method thus stands out as a method that has
merits both from the theoretical and from the practical point of view.
  Our study is based on the known explicit set of universal starting points
that is guaranteed to find all roots of polynomials of degree $d$
(appropriately normalized). We show that this set contains $d$ points that
converge very quickly to the $d$ roots: the expected total number of Newton
iterations required to find all roots with precision $\eps$ is
$O(d^3\log^3d+d\log|\log\eps|)$, which can be further improved to
$O(d^2\log^4d+d\log|\log\eps|)$; in the worst case allowing near-multiple
roots, the complexity is $O(d^4\log^2d+d^3\log^2d|\log\eps|)$. The arithmetic
complexity for all these estimates is the same as the number of Newton
iterations steps, up to a factor of $\log^2 d$.

use these spectra plus available photometry and images to characterize the

two groups: YSOs associated with extended emission in IRAC band 2 at 4.5 micron
(`outflow sources') and YSOs that have extended emission in all IRAC bands
peaking at the longest wavelengths (`red sources'). The two groups of objects
have distinctly different spectra: All the YSOs associated with outflows show
evidence of massive envelopes surrounding the protostar because the spectra
show deep silicate absorption features and absorption by ices at 6.0, 6.8, and
15.2 micron. We identify these YSOs with massive envelopes cool enough to
contain ice-coated grains as the `bloated' protostars in the models of Hosokawa
et al. All spectral maps show ionized forbidden lines and PAH emission
features. For four of the red sources, these lines are concentrated to the
centres of the maps, from which we infer that these YSOs are the source of
ionizing photons. Both types of objects show evidence of shocks, with most of
the outflow sources showing a line of [S I] in the outflows and two of the red
sources showing the more highly excited [Ne III] and [S IV] lines in outflow
regions at some distance from the YSOs. The 4.5 micron emission seen in the

caused by the process of charge exchange. In the outflow wind region, the

derived the metal abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe in the outflow. The ratios of
O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe are about 2, 3, and 2, respectively, relative to the

  (2012)",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.85.051108",,"cond-mat.stat-mech physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The transition between a regime in which thermodynamic relations apply only
to ensembles of small systems coupled to a large environment and a regime in
which they can be used to characterize individual macroscopic systems is
analyzed in terms of the change in behavior of the Jarzynski estimator of
equilibrium free energy differences from nonequilibrium work measurements.
Given a fixed number of measurements, the Jarzynski estimator is unbiased for
sufficiently small systems. In these systems, the directionality of time is
poorly defined and configurations that dominate the empirical average, but
which are in fact typical of the reverse process, are sufficiently well
sampled. As the system size increases the arrow of time becomes better defined.
The dominant atypical fluctuations become rare and eventually cannot be sampled
with the limited resources that are available. Asymptotically, only typical
work values are measured. The Jarzynski estimator becomes maximally biased and
approaches the exponential of minus the average work, which is the result that
is expected from standard macroscopic thermodynamics. In the proper scaling
limit, this regime change can be described in terms of a phase transition in
variants of the random energy model (REM). This correspondence is explicitly
demonstrated in several examples of physical interest: near-equilibrium

clusters at high redshift. Nearly all of the brightest and most massive
red-sequence galaxies are found within the bounds of the clusters and groups.
Despite the prevalence of these red-sequence galaxies, we find that the average
cluster galaxy has a spectrum indicative of a star-forming galaxy, with a star
formation rate between those of z~1 field galaxies and moderate redshift
cluster galaxies. The average group galaxy is even more active, exhibiting
properties indicative of a starburst. The presence of massive, red galaxies and
the high fraction of starbursting galaxies suggest that significant processing
is occurring in the group environment at z~1 and earlier. There is a deficit of
low-luminosity red-sequence galaxies in all Cl1604 clusters and groups,
suggesting that such galaxies transition to the red sequence at later times.
Extremely massive (10^12) red sequence galaxies are also absent from the Cl1604
clusters and groups. We suggest that such galaxies form at later times through
merging processes. There are also large populations of transition galaxies at
intermediate stellar masses present in the groups and clusters, suggesting that
such masses are important in the buildup of the red-sequence mass function at

negatively influence how those students later interpret quantum phenomena when

student perspectives on the interpretation of quantum physics is needed, both
to characterize student understanding of physics concepts, and to inform how we
might teach traditional content. Our previous investigations of student
perspectives on quantum physics have indicated they can be highly nuanced, and
may vary both within and across contexts. In order to better understand the
contextual and often seemingly contradictory stances of students on matters of
interpretation, we interviewed 19 students from four introductory modern
physics courses taught at the University of Colorado. We find that students
have attitudes and opinions that often parallel the stances of expert
physicists when arguing for their favored interpretations of quantum mechanics,
allowing for more nuanced characterizations of student perspectives in terms of
three key interpretive themes. We present a framework for characterizing
student perspectives on quantum mechanics, and demonstrate its utility in
interpreting the sometimes-contradictory nature of student responses to
previous surveys. We further find that students most often vacillate in their
responses when what makes intuitive sense to them is not in agreement with what
they consider to be a correct response, underscoring the need to distinguish

alternative method of generating the required ionising photons. In this Letter
we assess the contribution to hydrogen reionization from shocked gas associated
with gravitational infall. We find that shocks can ionize no more than a few
percent of the cosmic hydrogen by z~6. However, the small fraction of ionizing
radiation produced by fast accretion shocks would be significantly more biased
than that associated with stars, leading to a modification of the luminosity
weighted source clustering by ~10%. This modification of the bias may be
measurable with future precision experiments utilising the redshifted 21cm line
to study the distribution of hydrogen during the reionization era.

10) tube, the theoretical results for the breakdown bias voltage is quite
comparable with the experimental value. It is found that the Joule heat can be
greatly enhanced by increasing the chemical potential, while the role of the
temperature is not so important for Joule heat. In zigzag (10, 0) tube, the
Joule heat is smaller than the armchair tube, resulting from nonzero band gap
in the electron band structure. For the electronic conductance $G_{e}$ and
electron thermal conductance $\sigma_{el}$, the EPI has important effect at
higher temperature or higher chemical potential. Compared with ballistic
transport, there is an opposite tendency for $G_{e}$ to decrease with
increasing temperature after EPI is considered. This is due to the dominant
effect of the electron phonon scattering mechanism in the electron transport in
this situation. There is an interesting `electron-drag' phenomenon for the

potential, where phonons are dragged by electrons from low temperature region
into high temperature region through EPI effect.

that there is a mixture of upward and downward currents in the two foot-points
of an emerging flux-rope. The flux emergence rate is almost the same in both
the polarities. We observe that along with an increase in magnetic flux, the
net current in each polarity increases initially for about three days after
which it decreases. This net current is characterized by having exactly
opposite signs in each polarities while its magnitude remains almost the same
most of the time. The decrease of net current in both the polarities is due to
the increase of current having a sign opposite to that of the net current. The
dominant current, with same sign as the net current, is seen to increase first
and then decreases during the major X-class flares. Evolution of non-dominant
current appears to be a necessary condition for a flare initiation. The above
observations can have a plausible explanation in terms of the superposition of
two different force-free states resulting in non-zero Lorentz force in the
corona. This Lorentz force then push the coronal plasma and might facilitate
the magnetic reconnection required for flares. Also, the evolution of the net
current is found to follow the evolution of magnetic shear at the polarity
inversion line.

of relativistic fluid dynamics: the stability of dissipative fluid dynamics,
the shear viscosity, and fluid dynamics with triangle anomaly.(1)The second
order theory of fluid dynamics is necessary for causality. However the
causality cannot be guaranteed for all parameters. The constraints for
parameters are then given. We also point out that the causality and the
stability are inter-correlated. It is found that a causal system must be
stable, but an acausal system in the boost frame at high speed must be
unstable. (2)The transport coefficients can be determined in kinetic theory. We
will firstly discuss about derivation of the shear viscosity via variational
method in the Boltzmann equation. Secondly, we will compute the shear viscosity
via AdS/CFT duality in a Bjorken boost invariant fluid with radial flow. It is
found that the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density is consistent
with the work of Policastro, Son and Starinets. As another application of
AdS/CFT duality, we also investigate the property of baryons in the strongly
coupled plasma. (3)As the last topic, we investigate the fluid dynamics with
quantum triangle anomalies. Recently it is pointed out that the vorticity has
to be introduced to relativistic fluid dynamics with anomalies to satisfy the
second law of thermodynamics. These new terms are also relevant to the Chiral
Magnetic Effect. We find such terms can be derived from the kinetic approach.
The coefficients of the vorticity are also evaluated.

homeomorphic to lines. One can reduce the study to those distances on $\R$ that
are translation invariant. We study possible values of various metric
dimensions of such spaces. One of the main results is the equivalence of two
properties: the first one is linear connectedness and the second one is
1-dimensionality, with respect to Nagata dimension. Several concrete

that 30-50% of GK dwarfs in the solar neighborhood host planets with
sub-Neptune masses in orbits of P < 50 days. At first glance, this overall
occurrence rate seems inconsistent with the planet frequency measured during
Q0-Q2 of the Kepler Mission, whose 1,235 detected planetary candidates imply
that ~ 15% of main sequence dwarfs harbor short-period planets with R_pl < 4
R_Earth. A rigorous comparison between the two surveys is difficult, however,
as they observe different stellar populations and measure different planetary
properties. Here we report the results of a Monte Carlo study that can account
for this discrepancy via plausible distributions of planetary compositions. We
find that a population concurrently consisting of (1) dense silicate-iron
planets and (2) low-density gas-dominated worlds provides a natural fit to the
current data. In this scenario, the fraction of dense planets decreases with
increasing mass, from f_rocky = 90% at M = 1 M_Earth to f_rocky = 10% at M = 17
M_Earth. Our best fit population has a total occurrence rate of 40% for 2 < P <
50 days and 1 < M < 17 M_Earth, and is characterized by simple power-law
indices of the form N(M)dM ~ M^alpha dM and N(P)dP ~ P^beta dP with alpha =
-1.0 and beta = 0.0. Our model population therefore contains four free
parameters and is readily testable with future observations. Furthermore, our
model's insistence that at least two distinct types of planets must exist in
the survey data indicates that multiple formation mechanisms are at work to
produce the population of planets commonly referred to as ""super-Earths"".

reddening across a ~0.3 deg^2 area covering the Orion Nebula Cluster. On the

disentangling contaminants from bona-fide cluster members. For contaminant
stars, interstellar reddenings are estimated by comparison with a synthetic
galactic model. A statistical analysis is then performed to consistently
account for local extinction, reddening and star-counts analysis. We derive the
extinction map of the OMC-1 with angular resolution <5'. We also assemble a
sample of candidate cluster members, for which we measure the extinction
provided by the nebular environment. These extinction measurements are analyzed
similarly to the contaminant sample, and an extinction map of the Orion Nebula
is derived. The extinction provided by the OMC-1 is variable on spatial scales
of a few arcminutes, while showing a general increase from the outskirts
(A_V~6) to the direction of the Trapezium asterism (A_V>30). The Orion Nebula
extinction map is more irregular and optically thinner, with A_V of the order

particular the Dark Bay to the north-east of the Trapezium. Both maps also show
the presence of a north-south high-density ridge, which confirms the
filamentary structure of the Orion molecular complex inside which star
formation is still taking place.

of K by Z, then there is a natural obstruction class \delta_1(P) in \check
H^2(X,\uline Z) in sheaf cohomology whose vanishing is equivalent to the
existence of a \hat K-bundle \hat P over X with P \cong \hat P/Z. In this paper
we establish a link between homotopy theoretic data and the obstruction class
\delta_1(P) which in many cases can be used to calculate this class in explicit
terms. Writing \partial_d^P \: \pi_d(X) \to \pi_{d-1}(K) for the connecting
maps in the long exact homotopy sequence, two of our main results can be
formulated as follows. If Z is a quotient of a contractible group by the
discrete group \Gamma, then the homomorphism \pi_3(X) \to \Gamma induced by
\delta_1(P) \in \check H^2(X,\uline Z) \cong H^3_{\rm sing}(X,\Gamma) coincides
with \partial_2^{\hat K} \circ \partial_3^P and if Z is discrete, then
\delta_1(P) \in \check H^2(X,\uline Z) induces the homomorphism
-\partial_1^{\hat K} \circ \partial_2^P \: \pi_2(X) \to Z. We also obtain some
information on obstruction classes defining trivial homomorphisms on homotopy
groups.

complementary geometrical pictures of a same physical reality, so that, the
question about which is the physical conformal frame, does not arise. In
addition, arguments are given which point out that, unless a clear statement of
what is understood by ""equivalence of frames"" is made, the issue is a semantic
one. For definiteness, an intuitively ""natural"" statement of conformal
equivalence is given, which is associated with conformal invariance of the
field equations. Under this particular reading, equivalence can take place only
if the metric is defined up to a conformal equivalence class. A concrete
example of a conformal-invariant theory of gravity is then explored. Since
Brans-Dicke theory is not conformally invariant, then the Jordan's and
Einstein's frames of the theory are not equivalent. Otherwise, in view of the
alternative approach proposed here, these frames represent complementary
geometrical descriptions of a same phenomenon. The different points of view

suppression data and introducing no free parameters, the pQCD-based WHDG model
simultaneously describes qualitatively the suppression of light hadrons and
quantitatively the azimuthal anisotropy (over many centrality classes) of light
hadrons and the suppression of D mesons at LHC. The drag predictions shown
here--qualitatively constrained to RHIC data--compare poorly to the measured
suppression of D mesons, but the current experimental uncertainties are large.
The double ratio of D to B meson R_AA(p_T) should provide a robust experimental
measurement to distinguish between the very different assumptions of the
strength of interactions in the QGP produced in heavy ion collisions; i.e.,
whether, from a jet quenching standpoint, the medium is either weakly- or

core composed of five galaxies, which have Hickson's compact group

dispersion is relatively low (157+-44 km s-1). The projected mass, from the NUV

that is designed for a physical layer that can decode interfering transmissions
in distributed wireless networks. The proposed protocol pro-actively enforces
two independent packet transmissions to interfere in a controlled and
cooperative manner. The protocol ensures that when a node desires to transmit a
unicast packet, regardless of the destination, it coordinates with minimal
overhead with relay nodes in order to concurrently transmit over the wireless
channel with a third node. The relay is responsible for allowing packets from
the two selected nodes to interfere only when the desired packets can be
decoded at the appropriate destinations and increase the sum-rate of the
cooperative transmission. In case this is not feasible, classic cooperative or
direct transmission is adopted. To enable distributed, uncoordinated, and
adaptive operation of the protocol, a relay selection mechanism is introduced
so that the optimal relay is selected dynamically and depending on the channel
conditions. The most important advantage of the protocol is that interfering
transmissions can originate from completely independent unicast transmissions
from two senders. We present simulation results that validate the efficacy of
our proposed scheme in terms of throughput and delay.

  connected","Submitted to IEEE InfoComm",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Healing algorithms play a crucial part in distributed P2P networks where
failures occur continuously and frequently. Several self-healing algorithms
have been suggested recently [IPDPS'08, PODC'08, PODC'09, PODC'11] in a line of
work that has yielded gradual improvements in the properties ensured on the
graph. This work motivates a strong general phenomenon of edge-preserving
healing that aims at obtaining self-healing algorithms with the constraint that
all original edges in the graph (not deleted by the adversary), be retained in
every intermediate graph.
  The previous algorithms, in their nascent form, are not explicitly edge
preserving. In this paper, we show they can be suitably modified (We introduce
Xheal+, an edge-preserving version of Xheal[PODC'11]). Towards this end, we
present a general self-healing model that unifies the previous models. The main
contribution of this paper is not in the technical complexity, rather in the
simplicity with which the edge-preserving property can be ensured and the
message that this is a crucial property with several benefits. In particular,
we highlight this by showing that, almost as an immediate corollary, subgraph
densities are preserved or increased. Maintaining density is a notion motivated
by the fact that in certain distributed networks, certain nodes may require and
initially have a larger number of inter-connections. It is vital that a healing
algorithm, even amidst failures, respect these requirements. Our suggested
modifications yield such subgraph density preservation as a by product. In
addition, edge preservation helps maintain any subgraph induced property that
is monotonic. Also, algorithms that are edge-preserving require minimal
alteration of edges which can be an expensive cost in healing - something that
has not been modeled in any of the past work.

outside $2\sigma$ significance level in the whole multipole range $l=[2,101]$.
We examine the possibility that this asymmetry may be caused by the foreground
cleaning procedure or by residual foregrounds. By direct simulations, using the
Planck Sky Model for foregrounds we rule out this possibility. We also examine
several possible sub-dominant foregrounds, which might lead to such an
asymmetry. However in all cases we are unable to explain the signal seen in
data. We next examine cleaned maps, using procedures other than the one
followed by the WMAP Science team. Specifically we analysed the maps cleaned by
the IPSE procedure, Needlets and the harmonic ILC procedure. In all these cases
we do not find a statistically significant signal of power asymmetry. This is
in contrast to the result obtained by the WMAP best fit power spectrum as well
as the ILC map. Finally, we test for the contribution of low-$l$ multipoles to
the observed power asymmetry. We find that if we eliminate the first six
multipoles, $l=[2,7]$, the significance falls below $2\sigma$ CL. Hence we find
that the signal gets dominant contribution from low-$l$ modes.

the event is among the largest X-ray flares fromT Tauri stars.Since MAXI GSC
monitors a target only during a scan transit of about a minute per 92 min
orbital cycle, the luminosity at the flare peak might have been higher than
that detected. At the scan transit, we observed a high X-ray-to-bolometric
luminosity ratio, log $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$ = $-0.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$; i.e., the
X-ray luminosity is comparable to the bolometric luminosity. Since TWA-7 has
neither an accreting disk nor a binary companion, the observed event implies
that none of those are essential to generate such big flares in T Tauri stars.

ESO 138-G1 (z = 0.0091). These data reveal a complex spectrum in both its soft
and hard portions. The 0.5-2 keV band is characterized by a strong
'soft-excess' component with several emission lines, as commonly observed in
other narrow-line AGN. Above 3 keV, a power-law fit yields a very flat slope
(Gamma ~0.35), along with the presence of a prominent line-like emission
feature around ~6.4 keV. This indicates heavy obscuration along the line of
sight to the nucleus. We find an excellent fit to the 3-10 keV continuum with a
pure reflection model, which provides strong evidence of a Compton-thick
screen, preventing direct detection of the intrinsic nuclear X-ray emission.
Although a model consisting of a power law transmitted through an absorber with
Nh ~2.5 x 10^{23} cm^-2 also provides a reasonable fit to the hard X-ray data,
the equivalent width value of ~800 eV measured for the Fe Kalpha emission line
is inconsistent with a primary continuum obscured by a Compton-thin column
density. Furthermore, the ratio of 2-10 keV to de-reddened [OIII] fluxes for
ESO 138-G1 agrees with the typical values reported for well-studied
Compton-thick Seyfert galaxies. Finally, we also note that the upper limits to
the 15-150 keV flux provided by Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL/IBIS seem to rule out
the presence of a transmitted component of the nuclear continuum even in this
very hard X-ray band, hence imply that the column density of the absorber could
be as high as 10^{25} cm^-2. This makes ESO 138-G1 a very interesting, heavy
Compton-thick AGN candidate for the next X-ray missions with spectroscopic and
imaging capabilities above 10 keV.

  For the above setting, we present the following results for strongly

which takes $NRG(n,n^c)$ rounds, where $NRG(n,n^c)$ is the round complexity of
deterministic gossiping for vanilla model. (b) A deterministic protocol for

carbon in pristine graphene. Such device concepts would take advantage of the
control of the spin degree of freedom utilizing the widely available electric
fields in electronics or of topological transport mechanisms such as the
conjectured quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here we show, using first-principles
methods, that 5d transition-metal (TM) adatoms deposited on graphene display
remarkable magnetic properties. All considered TM adatoms possess significant
spin moments with colossal magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies as large as
50 meV per TM atom. We reveal that the magneto-electric response of deposited
TM atoms is extremely strong and in some cases offers even the possibility to
switch the spontaneous magnetization direction by a moderate external electric
field. We predict that an electrically tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect
can be observed in this type of hybrid materials.

Fixed Point Theorem says that every complete metric space has the BFPP.
However, E. Behrends pointed out \cite{Be1} that the converse implication does
not hold; that is, the BFPP does not imply completeness, in particular, there
is a non-closed subset of $\RR^2$ possessing the BFPP. He also asked \cite{Be2}
if there is even an open example in $\RR^n$, and whether there is a 'nice'
example in $\RR$. In this note we answer the first question in the negative,
the second one in the affirmative, and determine the simplest such examples in
the sense of descriptive set theoretic complexity.
  Specifically, first we prove that if $X\su\RR^n$ is open or $X\su\RR$ is
simultaneously $F_\si$ and $G_\de$ and $X$ has the BFPP then $X$ is closed.
Then we show that these results are optimal, as we give an $F_\si$ and also a
$G_\de$ non-closed example in $\RR$ with the BFPP.
  We also show that a nonmeasurable set can have the BFPP. Our non-$G_\de$
examples provide metric spaces with the BFPP that cannot be remetrised by any
compatible complete metric. All examples are in addition bounded.

wall consisted of a layer of spheres in a square arrangement. Two cases have
been considered. In the first case the spheres are small (with diameter
equivalent to 10.7 wall units) and the limit of the hydraulically smooth flow
regime is approached. In the second case the spheres are more than three times
larger (49.3 wall units) and the flow is in the transitionally rough flow
regime. Special emphasis is given on the characterisation of the force and
torque acting on a particle due to the turbulent flow. It is found that in both
cases the mean drag, lift and spanwise torque are to a large extent produced at
the top region of the particle surface. The intensity of the particle force
fluctuations is significantly larger in the large-sphere case, while the trend
differs for the fluctuations of the individual components of the torque. A
simplified model is used to show that the torque fluctuations might be
explained by the spheres acting as a filter with respect to the size of the
flow scales which can effectively generate torque fluctuations. Fluctuations of
both force and torque are found to exhibit strongly non-Gaussian probability
density functions with particularly long tails, an effect which is more
pronounced in the small-sphere case. Some implications of the present results

P_{K}, and of the optical depth, \tau_{K}, close to an angular offset position
of 90^{\circ} whereas lower values of P_{K} and \tau_{K} are observed for
smaller angular offsets. We interpret these results as evidence for the
presence of various magnetic field components toward lines of sight in the
vicinity of BN. On a larger scale, we measured the distribution of angular
offsets between available H-band polarization data and the same submm data set.
Here we find an increase of <P_{H}> with angular offset which we interpret as a
rotation of the magnetic field by \lesssim 60^{\circ}. This trend generalizes
previous results on small scale toward and around lines of sight to BN and is
consistent with a twist of the magnetic field on a larger scale towards OMC-1.
A comparison of our results with several other studies suggests that a

their importance sampling method is more efficient in terms of running time and

zero-one multi-way ($d$-way, $d \geq 2$) contingency tables under the no

by simulations that the SIS procedure with CP distribution to estimate the

our method to Samson's monks' data set. We end with further questions on the

superradiance (SR), i.e., accelerated relaxation of excited dipoles due to
cooperative spontaneous emission, first proposed by Dicke in 1954. Recent
authors have discussed SR in diverse contexts, including cavity quantum
electrodynamics, quantum phase transitions, and plasmonics. At the heart of
these various experiments lies the coherent coupling of constituent particles
to each other via their radiation field that cooperatively governs the dynamics
of the whole system. In the most exciting form of SR, called superfluorescence
(SF), macroscopic coherence spontaneously builds up out of an initially
incoherent ensemble of excited dipoles and then decays abruptly. Here, we
demonstrate the emergence of this photon-mediated, cooperative, many-body state
in a very unlikely system: an ultradense electron-hole plasma in a
semiconductor. We observe intense, delayed pulses, or bursts, of coherent
radiation from highly photo-excited semiconductor quantum wells with a
concomitant sudden decrease in population from total inversion to zero. Unlike
previously reported SF in atomic and molecular systems that occur on nanosecond
time scales, these intense SF bursts have picosecond pulse-widths and are
delayed in time by tens of picoseconds with respect to the excitation pulse.
They appear only at sufficiently high excitation powers and magnetic fields and
sufficiently low temperatures - where various interactions causing decoherence
are suppressed. We present theoretical simulations based on the relaxation and
recombination dynamics of ultrahigh-density electron-hole pairs in a quantizing
magnetic field, which successfully capture the salient features of the
experimental observations.

The gap is defined as the number of consecutive positive returns after a

therefore demonstrate the robustness of the evidence for critical behavior with
respect to the treatment of the electrostatic interactions. In addition, we
verify that the liquid is equilibrated at all densities on the Monte Carlo time
scale of our simulations, and also that there is no indication of crystal
formation during our runs. These findings demonstrate that the processes of
liquid-state relaxation and crystal nucleation are well separated in time.
Therefore, the bimodal shape of the density of states, and hence the critical
point itself, is a purely liquid-state phenomenon that is distinct from the
crystal-liquid transition.

Orcus and its companion Vanth using the adaptive-optics-fed integral-field
spectrograph SINFONI mounted on Yepun/UT4 at the European Southern Observatory
Very Large Telescope. We took advantage of a very favorable appulse (separation
of only 4"") between Orcus and the UCAC2 29643541 star (R = 11.6) to use the
adaptive optics mode of SINFONI, allowing both components to be spatially
resolved and Vanth colors to be extracted independently from Orcus. Results.
The spectrum of Orcus we obtain has the highest signal-to-noise ratio to date,
and we confirm the presence of H2O ice in crystalline form, together with the
presence of an absorption band at 2.2 {\mu}m. We set an upper limit of about 2%
for the presence of methane, and 5% for ethane. Because the methane alone
cannot account for the 2.2 {\mu}m band, the presence of ammonia is suggested to
the level of a couple of percent. The colors of Vanth are found slightly redder
than those of Orcus, but the large measurement uncertainties forbid us from
drawing conclusions on the origin of the pair (capture or co-formation).
Finally, we reset the orbital phase of Vanth around Orcus, and confirm the
orbital parameters derived by Brown et al. (2010, AJ 139).

heterogeneous sources is at glance a difficult task. This difficulty can be
overcome by Data Assimilation techniques. Such a method allows to combine in a

various type of observations. Beyond the inner advantage to use heterogeneous
instruments, this leads to obtain a significant increasing of the quality of
neutronic global state reconstruction with respect to individual use of

periastron passage flare, with flux densities for 9 days prior to the event
stable at ~ 1 mJy at 5.5 GHz and ~ 0.5 mJy at 9 GHz. The highest flux densities
of 43.0 +/- 0.5 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 29.9 +/- 0.6 mJy at 9 GHz were measured
during the flare's decline (MJD 55206.69) which continues towards pre-flare
flux densities over the following 6 days. Imaging of pre-flare data reveals
steady structure including two stable components within 15 arc-seconds of the
core which we believe may be persistent emission regions within the system's
outflows, one of which is likely associated with the system's counter-jet.
Unlike past observations carried out in the system's brighter epochs, we
observe no significant structural variations within \approx 3 arc-seconds of
the core's position. Model subtraction and difference mapping provide evidence
for variations slightly further from the core: up to 5"" away. If related to the
observed core flare, then these variations suggest very high outflow velocities
with {\Gamma} > 35, though this can be reduced significantly if we invoke phase
delays of at least one orbital period. Interestingly, the strongest structural
variations appear to the north west of the core, opposite to the strongest
arcsec-scale emission historically. We discuss the implications of this
behaviour, including the possibility of precession or a kinked approaching jet.

which jeopardizes renormalizability, besides the unexpected general relativity

degrees of freedom of the new pole. Next, the nonrelativistic effective
potential is determined from a scattering process of two identical massive

obtained, together with a Darwin-like term that comes from the extra non-pole

harmful, by power counting, but it can be eliminated by adjusting the free

celestial body other than the moon. The mission, which returned asteroid
samples to the Earth while overcoming various technical hurdles, ended on June
13, 2010, with the planned atmospheric re-entry. In order to safely deliver the
sample return capsule, the HAYABUSA spacecraft ended its 7-year journey in a
brilliant ""artificial fireball"" over the Australian desert. Spectroscopic
observation was carried out in the near-ultraviolet and visible wavelengths
between 3000 and 7500 \AA at 3 - 20 \AA resolution. Approximately 100 atomic
lines such as Fe I, Mg I, Na I, Al I, Cr I, Mn I, Ni I, Ti I, Li I, Zn I, O I,
and N I were identified from the spacecraft. Exotic atoms such as Cu I, Mo I,
Xe I and Hg I were also detected. A strong Li I line (6708 \AA) at a height of
~55 km originated from the onboard Li-Ion batteries. The FeO molecule bands at
a height of ~63 km were probably formed in the wake of the spacecraft. The
effective excitation temperature as determined from the atomic lines varied
from 4500 K to 6000 K. The observed number density of Fe I was about 10 times
more abundant than Mg I after the spacecraft explosion. N2+(1-) bands from a
shock layer and CN violet bands from the sample return capsule's ablating heat
shield were dominant molecular bands in the near-ultraviolet region of 3000 -
4000 \AA. OH(A-X) band was likely to exist around 3092 \AA. A strong shock
layer from the HAYABUSA spacecraft was rapidly formed at heights between 93 km
and 83 km, which was confirmed by detection of N2+(1-) bands with a vibration
temperature of ~13000 K. Gray-body temperature of the capsule at a height of
~42 km was estimated to be ~2437 K which is matched to a theoretical
prediction. The final message of the HAYABUSA spacecraft and its sample return
capsule are discussed through our spectroscopy.

contribution of the ghost loops to the self-energy of the gluon propagator, in
the Landau gauge. This is accomplished within the PT-BFM formalism, which
guarantees the gauge-invariance of the emerging answer. In particular, the
contribution of the ghost-loops is automatically transverse, by virtue of the
QED-like Ward identities satisfied in this framework. Using as nonperturbative
input the available lattice data for the ghost dressing function, we show that
the ghost contributions have a rather sizable effect on the overall shape of
the gluon propagator, both for $d=3,4$. Then, by exploiting a recently
introduced dynamical equation for the effective gluon mass, whose solutions
depend crucially on the characteristics of the gluon propagator at intermediate
energies, we show that if the ghost loops are removed from the gluon propagator
then the gluon mass vanishes. These findings strongly suggest that, at least at
the level of the Schwinger-Dyson equations, the effects of gluons and ghosts
are inextricably connected, and must be combined suitably in order to reproduce
the results obtained in the recent lattice simulations.

cosmological models (minisuperspace models) are described. The most important
issue is the construction, from the wave function, of a probability
distribution answering various questions of physical interest, such as the
probability of the system entering a given region of configuration space at any
stage in its entire history. A standard but heuristic procedure is to use the
flux of (components of) the wave function in a WKB approximation as the
probability. This gives sensible semiclassical results but lacks an underlying
operator formalism. Here, we supply the underlying formalism by deriving
probability distributions linked to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation using the
decoherent histories approach to quantum theory, building on the generalized
quantum mechanics formalism developed by Hartle. The key step is the
construction of class operators characterizing questions of physical interest.
Taking advantage of a recent decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time
problem in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we show that the appropriate
class operators in quantum cosmology are readily constructed using a complex
potential. The class operator for not entering a region of configuration space
is given by the $S$-matrix for scattering off a complex potential localized in
that region. We thus derive the class operators for entering one or more
regions in configuration space. The class operators commute with the
Hamiltonian, have a sensible classical limit and are closely related to an
intersection number operator. The corresponding probabilities coincide, in a
semiclassical approximation, with standard heuristic procedures.
