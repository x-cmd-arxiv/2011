powered with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy. Such
energy sources largely depend on environmental conditions, which are hard to
predict accurately. As such, it may only make sense to require the network
systems to support a soft quality of service (QoS) guarantee, i.e., to
guarantee a service requirement with a certain high probability. In this paper,
we intend to build a solid mathematical foundation to help better understand
the stochastic energy constraint and the inherent correlation between QoS and
the uncertain energy supply. We utilize a calculus approach to model the
cumulative amount of charged energy and the cumulative amount of consumed
energy. We derive upper and lower bounds on the remaining energy level based on
a stochastic energy charging rate and a stochastic energy discharging rate. By
building the bridge between energy consumption and task execution (i.e.,
service), we study the QoS guarantee under the constraint of uncertain energy
sources. We further show how performance bounds can be improved if some strong
assumptions can be made.

with a frictional interface is presented. The system studied is composed of two
homogeneous and isotropic elastic solids, brought into frictional contact by
remote normal compression. A shear wave, either time harmonic or a narrow band
pulse, is incident normal to the interface and propagates through the contact.
Two friction laws are considered and their influence on interface behavior is
investigated : Coulomb's law with a constant friction coefficient and a
slip-weakening friction law which involves static and dynamic friction
coefficients. The relationship between the nonlinear harmonics and the
dissipated energy, and their dependence on the contact dynamics (friction law,
sliding and tangential stress) and on the normal contact stress are examined in
detail. The analytical and numerical results indicate universal type laws for
the amplitude of the higher harmonics and for the dissipated energy, properly
non-dimensionalized in terms of the pre-stress, the friction coefficient and
the incident amplitude. The results suggest that measurements of higher
harmonics can be used to quantify friction and dissipation effects of a sliding
interface.

ZAMS, and their distance is estimated to be ~2 kpc. Of particular interest is
the C component, which shows strong hydrogen and forbidden emission lines at
optical wavelengths. All emission lines are spatially extended in the eastern
direction and appear to have a similar velocity shift, except for the [OI]

C. From the optical up to 10 micron, most circumstellar emission is located at

life. The probability of settlement is one of the quantitative characteristic
of the settlement process. The probability of larval contact with a substrate
is the upper bound of the probability of settlement. This work addresses the
problem of contact probability and contact rate of marine invertebrate larvae
with an isolated protruding collector located in an unbounded sea current.
There are two common approaches to the problem of contact probability. In one,
a collector induces certain cues, which help a larvae find the collector. In
such a case, the larva moves towards the collector deliberately, using its
navigation and propulsion devices. In the second approach, a larva moves
towards a collector as a passive small particle. In this case, the cause of
contact of a larva with a collector is a mechanical collision of a small moving
body with a large obstacle. We considered a larva which does not know the
location of the collector, which does not use its navigation device yet uses
its self-propulsion. We mimicked a larva by a tiny self-propelled underwater
vehicle, moving in shear flow of a large obstacle. We illustrated our approach
by studying contact of a larva of the Bryozoan Bugula neritina with a
cylindrical collector. We observed the behavior of this larva in a laboratory
flume, and according to the observations formulated a mathematical model of
larval motion in shear flow. The trajectories of a large number of larvae,
starting their motion far from a collector with random initial conditions are
calculated numerically, and the probability of their contact with a collector
is estimated. The results of Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate that larval
self-propulsion may increase the probability of their contact with a collector
by orders of magnitude compared to passive particles.

history within the Milky Way may be much more complex than that suggested by
its current low peculiar velocity. In particular, the Sun may have radially
migrated through the galactic disk by up to 5-6 kpc. This has important
ramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar
system may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were
significantly different from its current local galactic environment. To
characterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct
numerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that
end up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like
disk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may
belong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show
that field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's
extreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge
sometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the
chance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%
of the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find
its median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained
during the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar
dependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar
encounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of
magnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that
assumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material
trapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits can be extremely low and may present
difficulties for models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet
production.

asymptotic analysis tools out of optimization process, the proposed method is
much simpler, faster, accurate and practical. Because of not using any
relaxation or any approximate solution like previous works, the found answer
with this method is optimal. We can construct optimal variable node degree
distribution for any given binary erasure rate, {\epsilon}, and any check node

result, we obtain some degree distribution which their rates are close to the

potential energy landscape of the system. We study the dynamics of a small
atomic cluster using this description as well as molecular dynamics simulations
and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for this system. Many of the
remarkable features of the complex dynamics of glassy systems emerge from the
activated dynamics in the potential energy landscape of the atomic cluster. The
dynamics of the system exhibits typical characteristics of a strong supercooled
liquid when the system is allowed to explore the full configuration space. This
behavior arises because the dynamics is dominated by a few lowest-lying minima
of the potential energy and the potential energy barriers between these minima.
When the system is constrained to explore only a limited region of the
potential energy landscape that excludes the basins of attraction of a few
lowest-lying minima, the dynamics is found to exhibit the characteristics of a
fragile liquid.

sequential logic that exploits circuit-scale phase coherence for efficient
realizations of fundamental components such as a NAND-gate-with-fanout and a
bistable latch. Kerr-nonlinear optical resonators are utilized in combination
with interference effects to drive the binary logic. Quantum-optical
input-output models are characterized numerically using design parameters that
yield attojoule-scale energy separation between the latch states.

that the mechanism of addition and deletion can lead to the diversity of degree

  Workshop",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Virgo gravitational wave detector is an interferometer (ITF) with 3km
arms located in Pisa, Italy. From July to October 2010, Virgo performed its
third science run (VSR3) in coincidence with the LIGO detectors. Despite
several techniques adopted to isolate the interferometer from the environment,
seismic noise remains an important issue for Virgo. Vibrations produced by the
detector infrastructure (such as air conditioning units, water
chillers/heaters, pumps) are found to affect Virgo's sensitivity, with the main
coupling mechanisms being through beam jitter and scattered light processes.
The Advanced Virgo (AdV) design seeks to reduce ITF couplings to environmental
noise by having most vibration-sensitive components suspended and in-vacuum, as
well as muffle and relocate loud machines. During the months of June and July
2010, a Guralp-3TD seismometer was stationed at various locations around the
Virgo site hosting major infrastructure machines. Seismic data were examined
using spectral and coherence analysis with seismic probes close to the
detector. The primary aim of this study was to identify noisy machines which
seismically affect the ITF environment and thus require mitigation attention.
Analyzed machines are located at various distances from the experimental halls,
ranging from 10m to 100m. An attempt is made to measure the attenuation of
emitted noise at the ITF and correlate it to the distance from the source and
to seismic attenuation models in soil.

converted into both particle beams which causes pulsed emissions, and a highly
relativistic wind of electron-positron plasmas which forms surrounding nebulae
shining in X-rays and TeV gamma-rays. As a sequel of the first paper (Wada &
Shibata 2007), we carried out a three dimensional particle simulation for the
axisymmetric global magnetosphere. We present the results of additional
calculations, which are higher resolution model and higher pair creation rate
cases, and a detailed analysis for the solution. We confined to demonstrate the
cases of low pair creation rate, i.e., the magnetic field is fixed dipole. The
radiation drag of the plasma is taken in a form with the curvature radius along
the dipole magnetic field. The electrostatic interactions are calculated by a
programmable special purpose computer, GRAPE-DR (Makino et al 2007). Once pair
creation is onset in the outer gaps, the both signed particles begin to drift
across the closed magnetic field due to radiation drag, and they create
outflow. Eventually, the steady magnetosphere has outer gaps, both signed
outflow of plasma and a region in which the electric field is dominant
extending from the equator. In the steady state, the magnetic field made by
magnetospheric current is comparable to the dipole magnetic field outside of
several light radii from the star. In much more pair creation rate model, the
effect of modification of the magnetic field will bring about modification of
the outflow of the plasma, requiring further study with higher pair creation
rate model in a subsequent paper.

proton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV
collected with the CDF II detector. Events are selected from a sample of
candidates for production of $t\bar t$ pairs that decay into the lepton+jets
channel. The top-quark mass is measured with an unbinned maximum likelihood
method where the event probability density functions are calculated using
signal and background matrix elements, as well as a set of parameterized
jet-to-parton transfer functions. The likelihood function is maximized with
respect to the top-quark mass, the signal fraction in the sample, and a
correction to the jet energy scale (JES) calibration of the calorimeter jets.
The simultaneous measurement of the JES correction ($\JES$) amounts to an
additional \textit{in situ} jet energy calibration based on the known mass of
the hadronically decaying $W$ boson. Using the data sample of 578 lepton+jets
candidate events, corresponding to 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, the
top-quark mass is measured to be $m_t = \rm 172.4 \pm 1.4\:(stat+\JES) \pm

theoretical concept for the origin of differential rotation as a result of
interaction between convection and rotation. This talk outlines the current
state of the differential rotation theory. Numerical models based on the theory
reproduce the observed solar rotation quite closely. The models also compute
meridional flow and predict that the flow at the bottom of the convection zone
is not small compared to the surface. Theoretical predictions for stellar
differential rotation as a function of the stellar mass and rotation rate are

spectroscopy (ARPES) intensity from the slightly underdoped
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ in the superconductive (SC) state. The
momentum distribution curves (MDC) were fitted at each energy $\w$ employing
the SC Green's function along several cuts perpendicular to the Fermi surface
with the tilt angle $\theta$ with respect to the nodal cut. The clear
observation of particle-hole mixing was utilized such that the complex
self-energy as a function of $\omega$ is directly obtained from the fitting.
The obtained angle resolved self-energy is then used to deduce the Eliashberg
function $\alpha^2 F^{(+)}(\th,\w)$ in the diagonal channel by inverting the
d-wave Eliashberg equation using the maximum entropy method. Besides a broad
featureless spectrum up to the cutoff energy $\omega_c$, the deduced $\alpha^2
F$ exhibits two peaks around 0.05 eV and 0.015 eV. The former and the broad
feature are already present in the normal state, while the latter emerges only
below $T_c$. Both peaks become enhanced as $T$ is lowered or the angle $\th$
moves away from the nodal direction. The implication of these findings are
discussed.

joining', or 'quartet-NJ', to infer an unrooted species tree on a given set of
taxa T from empirical distributions of unrooted quartet gene trees on all
four-taxon subsets of T. In particular, quartet-NJ can be used to estimate a
species tree on T from distributions of gene trees on T. The quartet-NJ
algorithm is conceptually very similar to classical neighbor joining, and its
statistical consistency under the multispecies coalescent model is proved by a
variant of the classical 'cherry picking'-theorem. In order to demonstrate the
suitability of quartet-NJ, coalescent processes on two different species trees
(on five resp. nine taxa) were simulated, and quartet-NJ was applied to the
simulated gene tree distributions. Further, quartet-NJ was applied to quartet
distributions obtained from multiple sequence alignments of 28 proteins of nine
prokaryotes.

distribution functions to derive a conservative lower bound on the total mass
within 150-200 kpc.
  By approximating the potential as Keplerian, the phase-space distribution can
be simplified to that of a smooth distribution of energies and eccentricities.
Our approach naturally allows for calculating moments of the distribution
function, such as the radial profile of the orbital anisotropy. We construct a
family of phase-spaces with the resulting radial velocity dispersion
overlapping with that of distant kinematic tracers, while making no assumptions
about the density of the tracers and the radial profile of the velocity
anisotropy (beta).
  While there is no apparent upper bound for the Milky Way mass, at least as
long as only the radial motions are concerned, we find a sharp lower bound for
the mass that is small. In particular, a mass value of $2.4 \times 10^{11}$ of
solar masses, is still consistent with the dispersion profile at larger radii.
  Compared with much greater mass values in the literature, this result shows
that determining the Milky Way mass is strongly model dependent. We expect a
similar reduction of mass estimates in models assuming more realistic mass
profiles.

  Populations","Includes supplement as appendix",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large populations may contain numerous simultaneously segregating
polymorphisms subject to natural selection. Since selection acts on individuals
whose fitness depends on many loci, different loci affect each other's
dynamics. This leads to stochastic fluctuations of allele frequencies above and
beyond genetic drift - an effect known as genetic draft. Since recombination
disrupts associations between alleles, draft is strong when recombination is
rare. Here, we study a facultatively outcrossing population in a regime where
the frequency of out-crossing and recombination, r, is small compared to the
characteristic scale of fitness differences \sigma. In this regime, fit
genotypes expand clonally, leading to large fluctuations in the number of
recombinant offspring genotypes. The power law tail in the distribution of the
latter makes it impossible to capture the dynamics of draft by an effective
neutral model. Instead, we find that the fixation time of a neutral allele
increases only slowly with the population size but depends sensitively on the
ratio r/\sigma. The efficacy of selection is reduced dramatically and alleles
behave ""quasi-neutrally"" even for Ns>> 1, provided that |s|< s_c, where s_c
depends strongly on r/\sigma, but only weakly on population size N. In
addition, the anomalous fluctuations due to draft change the spectrum of
(quasi)-neutral alleles from f(\nu)\sim 1/\nu, corresponding to drift, to
\sim1/\nu^2. Finally, draft accelerates the rate of two step adaptations
through deleterious intermediates.

A
crucial issue with current manifold learning methods is that they lack a
natural quantitative measure to assess the quality of learned embeddings, which
greatly limits their applications to real-world problems. In this paper, a new
embedding quality assessment method for manifold learning, named as
Normalization Independent Embedding Quality Assessment (NIEQA), is proposed.
Compared with current assessment methods which are limited to isometric
embeddings, the NIEQA method has a much larger application range due to two
features. First, it is based on a new measure which can effectively evaluate
how well local neighborhood geometry is preserved under normalization, hence it
can be applied to both isometric and normalized embeddings. Second, it can
provide both local and global evaluations to output an overall assessment.
Therefore, NIEQA can serve as a natural tool in model selection and evaluation
tasks for manifold learning. Experimental results on benchmark data sets
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

proportional to the square of the lifetime $\tau$ and $<\sigma_{z}> \simeq 2

the spin polarization in the presence of the warping term. By the symmetry

views of the same quantum state: with one choice, the big-bang singularity
appears to be resolved, but with another choice it does not. This and other
considerations lead to the conclusion that the notion of internal time as it is

proposed variant of the relational-time construction, using a test clock that
is regarded as internal to a specific observer, appears to provide an improved

all relativistic micro causal, classically real models, short Local Realistic
Models (LRM). Non-locality, the infamous ""spooky interaction at a distance"" (A.
Einstein), is already sufficiently 'unreal' to motivate modifying the
""realistic"" in ""local realistic"". This has led to many worlds and finally many
minds interpretations. We introduce a simple many world model that resolves the
Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox. The model starts out as a classical LRM, thus
clarifying that the many worlds concept alone does not imply quantum physics.
Some of the desired non-locality, e.g. anti-correlation at equal measurement
angles, is already present, but Bell's inequality can of course not be
violated. A single and natural step turns this LRM into a quantum model
predicting the correct probabilities. Intriguingly, the crucial step does
obviously not modify locality but instead reality: What before could have still
been a direct realism turns into modal realism. This supports the trend away
from the focus on non-locality in quantum mechanics towards a mature structural
realism that preserves micro causality.

crowds. The behaviour of the crowd is considered from a twofold perspective. We
examine both the large scale behaviour of the crowd, and phenomena happening at
the individual pedestrian's level. We unify micro and macro in a single model,
by working with general mass measures and their transport. We improve existing
modelling by coupling a measure-theoretical framework with basic ideas of
mixture theory formulated in terms of measures. This strategy allows us to
define several constituents of the crowd, each having its own partial velocity.
We can thus examine the interaction between subpopulations that have distinct
characteristics. We give special features to those pedestrians that are
represented by the microscopic (discrete) part. In real life they would play
the role of leaders, predators etc. Since we are interested in the global
behaviour of the rest of the crowd, we model this part as a continuum. By
identifying a suitable concept of entropy, we derive an entropy inequality and
show that our model agrees with a Clausius-Duhem-like inequality. From this
inequality natural restrictions on the proposed velocity fields follow; obeying
these restrictions makes our model compatible with thermodynamics. We prove
existence and uniqueness of a solution to a time-discrete transport problem for
general mass measures. Moreover, we show properties like positivity of the
solution and conservation of mass. Our results are valid for mass measures in
their most general appearance. We give a robust scheme to approximate the
solution and illustrate numerically two-scale micro-macro behaviour. We
experiment with a number of scenarios, in order to capture the emergent
qualitative behaviour. Finally, we formulate open problems and basic research
questions, inspired by our modelling, analysis and simulation results.

interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and their distance, we study two cases for
each PWN. Because TeV PWNe have a large TeV gamma-rays to X-rays flux ratio,
the magnetic energy of the PWNe accounts for only a small fraction of the total
energy injected (typically a few x 10^{-3}). The gamma-ray emission is
dominated by inverse Compton scattering off the infrared photons of the ISRF. A
broken power-law distribution function for the injected particles reproduces
the observed spectrum well, except for G0.9+0.1. For G0.9+0.1, we do not need a
low energy counterpart because adiabatic losses alone are enough to reproduce
the radio observations. High energy power-law indices at injection are similar
(2.5 -- 2.6), while low energy power-law indices range from 1.0 to 1.6. The
lower limit of the particle injection rate indicates that the pair multiplicity
is larger than 10^4. The corresponding upper limit of the bulk Lorentz factor

network according to a geometric criterion. The degree of irreversibility of
the series is then estimated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (i.e. the
distinguishability) between the in and out degree distributions of the
associated graph. The method is computationally effi- cient, does not require
any ad hoc symbolization process, and naturally takes into account multiple
scales. We find that the method correctly distinguishes between reversible and
irreversible station- ary time series, including analytical and numerical
studies of its performance for: (i) reversible stochastic processes
(uncorrelated and Gaussian linearly correlated), (ii) irreversible stochastic
pro- cesses (a discrete flashing ratchet in an asymmetric potential), (iii)
reversible (conservative) and irreversible (dissipative) chaotic maps, and (iv)
dissipative chaotic maps in the presence of noise. Two alternative graph
functionals, the degree and the degree-degree distributions, can be used as the
Kullback-Leibler divergence argument. The former is simpler and more intuitive
and can be used as a benchmark, but in the case of an irreversible process with
null net current, the degree-degree distribution has to be considered to

the powerful tools of graph theory. Recent works have shown that the visibility
graphs inherit several degrees of correlations from their associated series,
and therefore such graph theoretical characterization is in principle possible.
However, both the mathematical grounding of this promising theory and its
applications are on its infancy. Following this line, here we address the
question of detecting hidden periodicity in series polluted with a certain
amount of noise. We first put forward some generic properties of horizontal
visibility graphs which allow us to define a (graph theoretical) noise
reduction filter. Accordingly, we evaluate its performance for the task of
calculating the period of noisy periodic signals, and compare our results with
standard time domain (autocorrelation) methods. Finally, potentials,

applied to the gyrokinetic studies of the Finite Orbit Width behavior of
guiding centers representing several species encountered in axisymmetric
tokamak plasma, as fusion products, thermal bulk and energetic particles from
Ion Cyclotron Radiation Heating and Negative Neutral Beam Injections.
  After the analysis of the basic results of orbit theory obtained with a
particularly convenient orbit coordinates set, it is shown how the proposed
F_eq satisfies the two conditions that make it an equilibrium distribution
function: (i) it must depend only on the constants of motion and adiabatic
invariants, and (ii) the guiding centers must remain confined for suitably long
time.
  Furthermore, the F_eq can be modeled, with a proper choice of its parameters,
to reproduce the most common distribution functions. A local Maxwellian
distribution function is obtained for the thermal plasma in the Zero Orbit
Width approximation.
  For the fusion \alpha particles, F_eq can also reproduce the Slowing Down
(SD) distribution function. More generally, for supra-thermal particles, when
external heatings are present, such as (N)NBI and ICRH, the proposed model
distribution function shows similarities with the anisotropic SD and the
biMaxwellian distribution functions.
  F_eq can be used to fit experimental profiles and it could provide a useful
tool for experimental and numerical data analysis. Moreover, it could help to

nested lattices is considered. Building on the compute-and-forward (C&F)
relaying strategy of Nazer and Gastpar, who demonstrated its asymptotic gain
using information-theoretic tools, an algebraic approach is taken to show its
potential in practical, non-asymptotic, settings. A general framework is
developed for studying nested-lattice-based PNC schemes---called lattice
network coding (LNC) schemes for short---by making a direct connection between
C&F and module theory. In particular, a generic LNC scheme is presented that
makes no assumptions on the underlying nested lattice code. C&F is
re-interpreted in this framework, and several generalized constructions of LNC
schemes are given. The generic LNC scheme naturally leads to a linear network
coding channel over modules, based on which non-coherent network coding can be
achieved. Next, performance/complexity tradeoffs of LNC schemes are studied,
with a particular focus on hypercube-shaped LNC schemes. The error probability
of this class of LNC schemes is largely determined by the minimum inter-coset
distances of the underlying nested lattice code. Several illustrative
hypercube-shaped LNC schemes are designed based on Construction A and D,
showing that nominal coding gains of 3 to 7.5 dB can be obtained with
reasonable decoding complexity. Finally, the possibility of decoding multiple
linear combinations is considered and related to the shortest independent
vectors problem. A notion of dominant solutions is developed together with a
suitable lattice-reduction-based algorithm.

from a quantum gravitational model of inflation. A distinctive feature of this
model is that the end of inflation witnesses a brief phase during which the
Hubble parameter oscillates in sign, changing the usual Hubble friction to
anti-friction. An earlier analysis of this model was based on numerically
evolving the graviton mode functions after guessing their initial conditions
near the end of inflation. The current study is based on an equation which
directly evolves the normalized square of the magnitude. We are also able to
make a very reliable estimate for the initial condition using a rapidly
converging expansion for the sub-horizon regime. Results are obtained for the
energy density per logarithmic wave number as a fraction of the critical
density. These results exhibit how the enhanced signal depends upon the number
of oscillatory periods; they also show the resonant effects associated with
particular wave numbers.

clusters (JCs), each of which consists of nearly a trillion micro brown dwarfs,
MACHOs of Earth mass. JCs in the galaxy center heat up their MACHOs by tidal
forces, which makes them expand, so that coagulation and star formation occurs.
Being continuously fed by matter from bypassing JCs, the central star(s) may
transform into a super massive black hole. It has a fast $t^3$ growth during
the first mega years, and a slow $t^{1/3}$ growth at giga years. JCs disrupted
by a close encounter with this black hole can provide matter for the bulge.
Those that survive can be so agitated that they form stars inside them and
become globular star clusters. Thus black holes mostly arise together with
galactic bulges in their own environment and are about as old as the oldest
globular clusters. The age 13.2 Gyr of the star HE 1523-0901 puts forward that
the Galactic halo was sufficiently assembled at that moment. The star formation
rate has a maximum at black hole mass $\sim4 \ 10^7M_\odot$ and bulge mass
$\sim5\,10^{10}M_\odot$. In case of merging supermassive black holes the JCs
passing near the galactic center provide ideal assistance to overcome the last

behavior of hadrons in external electric and magnetic fields. Near the chiral
limit, the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of pions, kaons, and nucleons
are determined in terms of a few well-known parameters. In this limit, hadrons
become quantum mechanically diffuse as polarizabilities scale with the inverse
square-root of the quark mass. In some cases, however, such predictions from
chiral perturbation theory have not compared well with experimental data.
Ultimately we must turn to first principles numerical simulations of QCD to
determine properties of hadrons, and confront the predictions of chiral
perturbation theory. To address the electromagnetic polarizabilities, we
utilize the background field technique. Restricting our attention to
calculations in background electric fields, we demonstrate new techniques to
determine electric polarizabilities and baryon magnetic moments for both
charged and neutral states. As we can study the quark mass dependence of
observables with lattice QCD, the lattice will provide a crucial test of our
understanding of low-energy QCD, which will be timely in light of ongoing
experiments, such as at COMPASS and HI\gamma S.

Rokhsar-Kivelson wave functions constructed from a dimer model on the
triangular lattice. By including a fugacity $t$ on some suitable bonds, one
interpolates between the triangular lattice (t=1) and the square lattice (t=0).
The wave function is known to be a massive $\mathbb Z_2$ topological liquid for
$t>0$ whereas it is a gapless critical state at t=0. We mainly consider two
geometries for the subsystem: that of a semi-infinite cylinder, and the
disk-like setup proposed by Kitaev and Preskill [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 110404
(2006)]. In the cylinder case, the entropies contain an extensive term --
proportional to the length of the boundary -- and a universal sub-leading
constant $s_n(t)$. Fitting these cylinder data (up to a perimeter of L=32
sites) provides $s_n$ with a very high numerical accuracy ($10^{-9}$ at t=1 and
$10^{-6}$ at $t=0.5$). In the topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ liquid phase we find
$s_n(t>0)=-\ln 2$, independent of the fugacity $t$ and the R\'enyi parameter
$n$. At t=0 we recover a previously known result, $s_n(t=0)=-(1/2)\ln(n)/(n-1)$
for $n<1$ and $s_n(t=0)=-\ln(2)/(n-1)$ for $n>1$. In the disk-like geometry --
designed to get rid of the boundary contributions -- we find an entropy $s^{\rm

the result of Flammia {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 261601 (2009)]. Some

all rank 6 subgroups), there are only three different cases corresponding to
the number of vector messengers. As a robust prediction we find that sfermion
masses are SU(5) invariant at the GUT scale, even if the gauge group does not
contain SU(5). If SUSY breaking is mediated purely by the U(1) generator that
commutes with SO(10) we obtain universal sfermion masses and thus can derive

We note that the mass function of the isolated clusters can be separately
evaluated through the modification of the recently developed
Corasaniti-Achitouv (CA) theory according to which the stochastic collapse
barrier is quantified by two coefficients: the drifting average coefficient
(\beta) and the diffusion coefficient (D_B). Regarding $\beta$ in the CA
formalism as an adjustable parameter and assuming that the formation of
isolated clusters corresponds to the case of D_B=0, we determine the mass
function of the isolated clusters by fitting the numerical results from the
MICE simulations to the modified CA formula. It is found that the best-fit
value of beta changes with redshift and that the CA mass function with D_B=0
agrees very well with the numerical results at various redshifts. Defining the
relative abundance of the isolated clusters, xi_I, as the ratio of the
cumulative mass function of the isolated clusters to that of the non-isolated
clusters at a given epoch, we finally show how sensitively xi_I changes with

of agent based opinion dynamics as well as other related agent based models
(ABM). By viewing the ABM dynamics as a micro description of the process, we
show how the corresponding macro description is obtained by a projection
construction. Then, well known conditions for lumpability make it possible to
establish the cases where the macro model is still Markov. In this case we
obtain a complete picture of the dynamics including the transient stage, the
most interesting phase in applications. For such a purpose a crucial role is
played by the type of probability distribution used to implement the stochastic
part of the model which defines the updating rule and governs the dynamics. In
addition, we show how restrictions in communication leading to the co-existence
of different opinions follow from the emergence of new absorbing states. We
describe our analysis in detail with some specific models of opinion dynamics.
Generalizations concerning different opinion representations as well as opinion
models with other interaction mechanisms are also discussed. We find that our
method may be an attractive alternative to mean-field approaches and that this
approach provides new perspectives on the modeling of opinion exchange
dynamics, and more generally of other ABM.

the single-particle continuum and the phonon coupling. Our analysis shows two
distinct regions for which the integral characteristics of both the giant and
pygmy resonances behave rather differently. For neutron-rich nuclei, starting
from $^{132}$Sn, we obtain a giant E1 resonance which significantly deviates
from the widely-used systematics extrapolated from experimental data in the
$\beta$-stability valley. We show that the inclusion of the phonon coupling is
necessary for a proper description of the low-energy pygmy resonances and the
corresponding transition densities for $A<$132 nuclei, while in the $A>132$
region the influence of phonon coupling is significantly smaller. The radiative
neutron capture cross sections leading to the stable $^{124}$Sn and unstable
$^{132}$Sn and $^{150}$Sn nuclei are calculated with both the (Q)RPA and the
beyond-(Q)RPA strength functions and shown to be sensitive to both the
predicted low-lying strength and the phonon coupling contribution. The
comparison with the widely-used phenomenological Generalized Lorentzian
approach shows considerable differences both for the strength function and the
radiative neutron capture cross section. In particular, for the neutron-rich
$^{150}$Sn, the reaction cross section is found to be increased by a factor
greater than 20. We conclude that the present approach may provide a complete
and coherent description of the $\gamma$-ray strength function for astrophysics
applications. In particular, such calculations are highly recommended for a
reliable estimate of the electromagnetic properties of exotic nuclei.

from $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB) using km-size neutrino telescopes, specifically
for the ANTARES neutrino telescope. Although optimized to detect upgoing
neutrino-induced muons, neutrino telescopes nevertheless have a potential to
detect high-energy photons by detecting downgoing muons from the
electromagnetic cascade induced by the interaction of TeV photons with the
Earth's atmosphere. The photon energy spectrum of a GRB is modeled by a simple
power law and is normalized by simple energy considerations. Taking into
account the absorption of TeV photons by cosmic infrared backgrounds, an
optical depth table calculated from a model by \cite{fin10} is used and the
arriving number of photons on top of the Earth atmosphere is determined. Muon
production in the atmosphere is determined by considering two main channels of
muon production: Pion photoproduction and direct muon pair production. The muon
energy loss during their traverse from the surface to the bottom of the sea is
determined using the standard muon energy loss formula. Assuming different
detector sizes, the number of detectable muons from single GRB events located
at different redshifts and zenith distances is determined. The background is
calculated assuming it consists primarily of cosmic ray-induced downgoing
muons. The detection significance is calculated and it can be concluded that to
obtain at least $3\sigma$ detection significance, a typical GRB has to be
located at redshift $z \lesssim 0.07$ if the detector's muon effective area is
$A^{\mu}_{\rm eff} \sim 10^{-2}\;{\rm km}^{2}$, or redshift $z \lesssim 0.15$,

to be systematic differences in the positions and equatorward drift rates as a

most of the differences in the positions and equatorward drift rates disappear.
The differences that remain disappear entirely if curve fitting is used to

cross-correlating public catalogues released by large surveys. Using VO tools
we performed a cross-match of the WISE Preliminary Release, the 2MASS Point
Source and the SDSS Data Release 7 catalogues over the whole area of sky that
they have in common ($\sim$ 4000 deg$^{2}$). Photometric and proper motion
criteria were used to obtain a list of BD candidates. A temperature estimate is
provided for each candidate based on their spectral energy distribution using
VOSA, a VO tool for SED fitting. We derive the spectral types from the
effective temperatures. Distances, calculated from the absolute magnitude-
spectral type relation, place our candidates at 14-80 pc from the Sun, assuming
that they are single. We have identified 31 BD candidates, 25 of which have
already been reported in the literature. The remaining six candidates have been
classified as L- (four) and T-type (two) objects. The high rate of recovery of

decoupling property of vacuum and nonvacuum gravitational field equations in
Einstein gravity and $f(R,T)$-modifications. The constructions are possible in
terms of geometric and physical objects adapted to certain nonholonomic 2+2
splitting with local fibred structure. This allows us to generate exact and/or
parametric depending solutions with generic off-diagonal metrics and
generalized, or Levi-Civita, connections. Different classes of modified
spacetimes are determined by corresponding generating and integration functions
depending, in general, on all space and time coordinates and may possess, or
not, Killing symmetries. The initial data sets for the Cauchy problem and their
global properties are analyzed. There are formulated the criteria of evolution
with spacetime splitting and decoupling of fundamental field equations.
Examples of exact solutions defining ellipsoid deformations of black hole
metrics and solitonic configurations are provided.

the general relativity theory and modifications, written with respect to
nonholonomic frames with 2+2 spacetime decomposition. This allows us to
integrate the Einstein equations (eqs) in very general forms with generic
off--diagonal metrics depending on all spacetime coordinates via generating and
integration functions containing (un--)broken symmetry parameters. We associate
families of off-diagonal Einstein manifolds to certain classes of covariant
gravity theories which have a nice ultraviolet behavior and seem to be (super)
renormalizable in a sense of covariant modifications of Horava-Lifshits
gravity. The apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance is present in some
""partner"" anisotropically induced theories due to nonlinear coupling with
effective parametric interactions determined by nonholonomic constraints and
generic off-diagonal gravitational and matter fields configurations. Finally,
we show how the constructions can be extended to include exact solutions for
conjectured covariant reonormalizable models with Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs
fields.
