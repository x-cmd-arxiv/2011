quantitative differences in particle statistics if compared to Direct Numerical
Simulations (DNS) which, in the context of the present study, is considered the
exact reference case. Differences are primarily due to filtering, a fundamental
intrinsic feature of LES. Filtering the fluid velocity field yields approximate
computation of the forces acting on particles and, in turn, trajectories that
are inaccurate when compared to those of DNS. In this paper, we focus precisely
on the filtering error for which we quantify a lower bound. To this aim, we use
a DNS database of inertial particle dispersion in turbulent channel flow and we
perform a-priori tests in which the error purely due to filtering is singled
out removing error accumulation effects, which would otherwise lead to
progressive divergence between DNS and LES particle trajectories. By applying
filters of different type and width at varying particle inertia, we
characterize the statistical properties of the filtering error as a function of
the wall distance. Results show that filtering error is stochastic and has a
non-Gaussian distribution. In addition, the distribution of the filtering error
depends strongly on the wall-normal coordinate being maximum in the buffer
region. Our findings provide insight on the effect of subgrid-scale velocity
field on the force driving the particles, and establish the requirements which
a LES model must satisfy to predict correctly the velocity and the trajectory
of inertial particles.

Planetary Nebulae (PNe) and \ion{H}{ii} regions as observational constraints.
Two sets of chemical abundances, one derived from collisionally excited lines
(CELs) and one, from recombination lines (RLs), are used. We try to use our
models as a tool to discriminate between both procedures for abundance
determinations. In our chemical evolution code, the chemical contribution of
low and intermediate mass stars is time delayed, while for the massive stars
the chemical contribution follows the instantaneous recycling approximation.
Our models have two main free parameters: the mass-loss rate of a well-mixed
outflow and the upper mass limit, $M_{up}$, of the initial mass function (IMF).
To reproduce the gaseous mass and the present-day O/H value we need to vary the
outflow rate and the $M_{up}$ value.

Casimir Effect is arguably the most salient manifestation of the quantum

of neutral parallel conducting plates. The presence of the plates modifies the
quantum vacuum, and this modifcation causes the plates to be pulled toward each
other. The Casimir Effect has also been explored in the context of higher
dimensional theories. The non-trivial boundary conditions imposed by
compactified periodic higher dimensions is know to alter the vacuum in a
quantifiable way, and is a possible solution to the issue of modulus
stabilization, namely - the stabilization of higher dimensions. Typical in
Casimir energy calculations are renormalization techniques which are used to
tame the infinite sums and integrals that arise. These calculations are usally
fairly involved, and explicit pedagogical material is sparse. The purpose of

properties of space-time suggest that space-time could present a foamy
structure and also that, in certain cases, quantum gravity (QG) may manifest at
energies much below the Planck scale. One of the observable effects could be
the degradation of the diffraction images of distant sources.
  Aims: We searched for this degradation effect, caused by QG fluctuations, in
the light of the farthest quasars (QSOs) observed by the Hubble Space Telescope
with the aim of setting new limits on the fluctuations of the space-time foam
and QG models.
  Methods: We developed a software that estimates and compares the phase
variation in the interference patterns of the high-redshift QSOs, taken from
the snapshot survey of HST-SDSS, with those of stars that are expected to not
be affected by QG effects. We used a two-parameter function to determine, for
each test star and QSO, the maximum of the diffraction pattern and to calculate
the Strehl ratio.
  Results: Our results go far beyond those already present in the literature.
By adopting the most conservative approach where the correction terms, that
describe the possibility for space-time fluctuations cumulating across long
distances and partially compensate for the effects of the phase variations, are
taken into account. We exclude the random walk model and most of the
holographic models of the space-time foam. Without considering these correction
terms, all the main QG scenarios are excluded. Finally, our results show the
absence of any directional dependence of QG effects and the validity of the
cosmological principle with an independent method; that is, viewed on a large
scale, the properties of the Universe are the same for all observers, including
the effects of space-time fluctuations.

naturally yields four-dimensional theories without a cosmological constant. The
question of chirality preservation in such a reduction has been a topic of
debate. In this article, it is shown that the possibilities of dimensional
reduction bifurcate into two separate consistent dimensional-reduction schemes.
One of these retains the massless SU(2) vector gauge triplet arising from the
sphere's isometries, but it produces a non-chiral four-dimensional theory. The
other consistent scheme sets to zero the SU(2) gauge fields, but retains the

resolve entities across the different web sites, and find that we can obtain

also translates into robustness, which often reduces the amount of training

Furthermore, the technique provides robustness when resolving sites that have

Telescope (BAT) observations of the five brightest Seyfert galaxies at hard
X-rays, to study their flux and spectral variability in the 20-100 keV energy
band. The column density in these objects is less than 10^24 cm-2, which
implies that the Swift/BAT data allow us to study the ""true"" variability of the
central source. Results: All objects show significant variations, with an
amplitude which is similar to the AGN variability amplitude at energies below
10 keV. We found evidence for an anti-correlation between variability amplitude
and black hole mass. The light curves in both bands are well correlated, with
no significant delays on time scales as short as 2 days. NGC 4151 and NGC 2110
do not show spectral variability, but we found a significant anti-correlation
between hardness ratios and source flux in NGC 4388 (and NGC 4945, IC 4329, to
a lesser extent). This ""softer when brighter"" behaviour is similar to what has
been observed at energies below 10 keV, and cannot be explained if the
continuum varies only in flux; the intrinsic shape should also steepen with
increasing flux. Conclusions: The presence of significant flux variations
indicate that the central source in these objects is intrinsically variable on
time scales as short as 1-2 days. The intrinsic slope of the continuum varies
with the flux (at least in NGC 4388). The positive ""spectral slope-flux""
correlation can be explained if the temperature of the hot corona decreases
with increasing flux. The lack of spectral variations in two objects, could be
due to the fact that they may operate in a different ""state"", as their
accretion rate is less than 1% of the Eddington limit (significantly smaller
than the rate of the other three objects in the sample).

lead-lead collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The results are based on an integrated luminosity
of approximately 7 ub^-1. Elliptic flow is measured over a wide region in
pseudorapidity, |eta| < 2.5, and over a broad range in transverse momentum, 0.5
< p_T < 20 GeV. The elliptic flow parameter v_2 is obtained by correlating
individual tracks with the event plane measured using energy deposited in the
forward calorimeters. As a function of transverse momentum, v_2(p_T) reaches a
maximum at p_T of about 3 GeV, then decreases and becomes weakly dependent on
p_T above 7 - 8 GeV. Over the measured pseudorapidity region, v_2 is found to
be approximately independent of |eta| for all collision centralities and
particle transverse momenta, something not observed in lower energy collisions.
The results are discussed in the context of previous measurements at lower
collision energies, as well as recent results from the LHC.

spanners that trades between the maximum degree, diameter and weight
gracefully. For a positive integer k, our construction provides a
(1+eps)-spanner with maximum degree O(k), diameter O(log_k n + alpha(k)),
weight O(k \cdot log_k n \cdot log n) \cdot w(MST(S)), and O(n) edges. Note
that for k= n^{1/alpha(n)} this gives rise to diameter O(alpha(n)), weight
O(n^{1/alpha(n)} \cdot log n \cdot alpha(n)) \cdot w(MST(S)) and maximum degree
O(n^{1/alpha(n)}), which improves upon a classical result of Arya et al.
\cite{ADMSS95}; in the corresponding result from \cite{ADMSS95} the spanner has
the same number of edges and diameter, but its weight and degree may be
arbitrarily large. Also, for k = O(1) this gives rise to maximum degree O(1),
diameter O(log n) and weight O(log^2 n) \cdot w(MST(S)), which reproves another
classical result of Arya et al. \cite{ADMSS95}. Our bound of O(log_k n +
alpha(k)) on the diameter is optimal under the constraints that the maximum
degree is O(k) and the number of edges is O(n). Our bound on the weight is
optimal up to a factor of log n. Our construction also provides a similar
tradeoff in the complementary range of parameters, i.e., when the weight should
be smaller than log^2 n, but the diameter is allowed to grow beyond log n.
  For random point sets in the d-dimensional unit cube, we ""shave"" a factor of
log n from the weight bound. Specifically, in this case our construction
achieves maximum degree O(k), diameter O(log_k n + alpha(k)) and weight that is
with high probability O(k \cdot log_k n) \cdot w(MST(S)).
  Finally, en route to these results we devise optimal constructions of
1-spanners for general tree metrics, which are of independent interest.

In order to include particles with transverse momentum as low as 30 MeV, the
data were recorded with the central solenoid magnet off. Charged particles were
reconstructed with two algorithms (2-point ""tracklets"" and full tracks) using
information from the pixel detector only. The lead-lead collision centrality
was characterized by the total transverse energy in the forward calorimeter in
the range 3.2 < |eta| < 4.9. Measurements are presented of the per-event
charged particle density distribution, dN_ch/deta, and the average charged
particle multiplicity in the pseudorapidity interval |eta|<0.5 in several
intervals of collision centrality. The results are compared to previous
mid-rapidity measurements at the LHC and RHIC. The variation of the
mid-rapidity charged particle yield per colliding nucleon pair with the number
of participants is consistent with the lower sqrt(s_NN) results. The shape of
the dN_ch/deta distribution is found to be independent of centrality within the

guarantee the validity of the weak equivalence principle to all orders in the

symmetry under which the scalar field transforms by a shift, and from the
symmetry required to couple a massless spin two particle to matter
(diffeomorphism invariance). But the same identities also predict violations of
the weak equivalence principle relatively suppressed by at least two powers of
the gravitational couplings, and imply that quantum corrections do not preserve
the structure of the action of these theories. We illustrate our analysis with
a set of specific examples for spin zero and spin half matter fields that show
why matter couplings do respect the equivalence principle, and how the
couplings to the gravitational scalar lead to the weak equivalence principle

tridiagonal matrices is the iteration of certain special maps $F_\sigma$ called
shifted $QR$ steps. Such maps preserve spectrum and a natural common domain is
${\cal T}_\Lambda$, the manifold of real symmetric tridiagonal matrices
conjugate to the diagonal matrix $\Lambda$. More precisely, a (generic) shift
$s \in \RR$ defines a map $F_s: {\cal T}_\Lambda \to {\cal T}_\Lambda$. A
strategy $\sigma: {\cal T}_\Lambda \to \RR$ specifies the shift to be applied
at $T$ so that $F_\sigma(T) = F_{\sigma(T)}(T)$. Good shift strategies should
lead to fast deflation: some off-diagonal coordinate tends to zero, allowing
for reducing of the problem to submatrices. For topological reasons, continuous
shift strategies do not obtain fast deflation; many standard strategies are
indeed discontinuous. Practical implementation only gives rise systematically
to bottom deflation, convergence to zero of the lowest off-diagonal entry
$b(T)$. For most shift strategies, convergence to zero of $b(T)$ is cubic,
$|b(F_\sigma(T))| = \Theta(|b(T)|^k)$ for $k = 3$. The existence of arithmetic
progressions in the spectrum of $T$ sometimes implies instead quadratic
convergence, $k = 2$. The complete integrability of the Toda lattice and the

altitude of 4100 m. It will observe atmospheric air showers via the water
Cherenkov method. HAWC will consist of 300 large water tanks instrumented with
4 photomultipliers each. HAWC has two data acquisition (DAQ) systems. The main
DAQ system reads out coincident signals in the tanks and reconstructs the
direction and energy of individual atmospheric showers. The scaler DAQ counts
the hits in each photomultiplier tube (PMT) in the detector and searches for a
statistical excess over the noise of all PMTs. We show that HAWC has a
realistic opportunity to observe the high-energy power law components of GRBs
that extend at least up to 30 GeV, as it has been observed by Fermi LAT. The
two DAQ systems have an energy threshold that is low enough to observe events
similar to GRB 090510 and GRB 090902b with the characteristics observed by
Fermi LAT. HAWC will provide information about the high-energy spectra of GRBs
which in turn could help to understanding about e-pair attenuation in GRB jets,
extragalactic background light absorption, as well as establishing the highest
energy to which GRBs accelerate particles.

metallization can be achieved via hydrogen atoms occupying the second silicon
layer. Further increases of hydrogen occupation on the second silicon layer
sites result in a loss of this metallization. For the former scenario, where
metallization occurs, we found a new vibrational mode at 1870 cm-1, which is

rapid (<1 Gyr) timescale for the formation of the bulge, even near its

sulphur in the metal poor globular cluster (GC) NGC 6397, as detected in a
MIKE/Magellan high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectrum of one red giant
star. While abundance ratios of sulphur are available for a larger number of
Galactic stars down to an [Fe/H] of ~ -3.5 dex, no measurements in globular
clusters more metal poor than -1.5 dex have been reported so far. We find a
NLTE, 3-D abundance ratio of [S/Fe] = +0.52 +/- 0.20 (stat.) +/- 0.08 (sys.),
based on the S I, Multiplet 1 line at 9212.8A. This value is consistent with a
Galactic halo plateau as typical of other alpha-elements in GCs and field
stars, but we cannot rule out its membership with a second branch of increasing
[S/Fe] with decreasing [Fe/H], claimed in the literature, which leads to a
large scatter at metallicities around -2 dex. The [S/Mg] and [S/Ca] ratios in
this star are compatible with a Solar value to within the (large)
uncertainties. Despite the very large scatter in these ratios across Galactic
stars between literature samples, this indicates that sulphur traces the
chemical imprints of the other alpha-elements in metal poor GCs. Combined with
its moderate sodium abundance ([S/Na]_NLTE=0.48), the [S/Fe] ratio in this GC
extends a global, positive S-Na correlation that is not seen in field stars and
might indicate that proton-capture reactions contributed to the production of
sulphur in the (metal poor) early GC environments.

with one order of magnitude different heating rates. The fraction of trapped
CO2 is 44 - 84 % with respect to the initial CO2 content for the investigated
experimental conditions. This is reproduced quantitatively by the extended
three-phase model that is introduced here. The H2O:CO and H2O:CO2:CO
experiments are consistent with the H2O:CO2 desorption trends, suggesting that
the model can be used for other ice species found in the interstellar medium to
significantly improve the parameterization of ice desorption.

binaries are likely to be detected by advanced networks of ground-based
gravitational wave (GW) interferometers. Maximizing the science returns from
such a discovery will require the identification and localization of an
electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. Here we critically evaluate and compare
several possible counterparts, including short-duration gamma-ray bursts
(SGRBs), ""orphan"" optical and radio afterglows, and ~day-long optical
transients powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei synthesized in the
merger ejecta (""kilonovae""). We assess the promise of each counterpart in terms
of four ""Cardinal Virtues"": detectability, high fraction, identifiability, and
positional accuracy. Taking into account the search strategy for typical error
regions of ~10s degs sq., we conclude that SGRBs are the most useful to confirm
the cosmic origin of a few GW events, and to test the association with NS
mergers. However, for the more ambitious goal of localizing and obtaining
redshifts for a large sample of GW events, kilonovae are instead preferred.
Off-axis optical afterglows will be detectable for at most ~10% of all events,
while radio afterglows are promising only for the unique combination of
energetic relativistic ejecta in a high density medium, and even then will
require hundreds of hours of EVLA time per event. Our main recommendations
are:(i) an all-sky gamma-ray satellite is essential for temporal coincidence
detections, and for GW searches of gamma-ray triggered events; (ii) LSST should
adopt a 1-day cadence follow-up strategy, ideally with ~0.5 hr per pointing to
cover GW error regions (the standard 4-day cadence and depth will severely
limit the probability of a unique identification); and (iii) radio searches
should only focus on the relativistic case, which requires observations for a
few months.

(sSFRs) of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) is crucial for determining their role
in the cosmic galaxy/star formation. However, there is as yet no consensus over
the typical M* of SMGs. Specifically, even for the same set of SMGs, the
reported average M* have ranged over an order of magnitude, from ~5x10^10 Mo to
~5x10^11 Mo. Here we study how different methods of analysis can lead to such
widely varying results. We find that, contrary to recent claims in the
literature, potential contamination of IRAC 3-8 um photometry from hot dust
associated with an active nucleus is not the origin of the published
discrepancies in derived M*. Instead, we expose in detail how inferred M*
depends on assumptions made in the photometric fitting, and quantify the
individual and cumulative effects of different choices of initial mass
function, different brands of evolutionary synthesis models, and different
forms of assumed star-formation history. We review current observational
evidence for and against these alternatives as well as clues from the
hydrodynamical simulations, and conclude that, for the most justifiable choices
of these model inputs, the average M* of SMGs is ~2x10^11 Mo. We also confirm
that this number is perfectly reasonable in the light of the latest
measurements of their dynamical masses, and the evolving M* function of the
overall galaxy population. M* of this order imply that the average sSFR of SMGs
is comparable to that of other star-forming galaxies at z>2, at 2-3 Gyr^-1.
This supports the view that, while rare outliers may be found at any M*, most
SMGs simply form the top end of the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies at
these redshifts. Conversely, this argues strongly against the viewpoint that
SMGs are extreme pathological objects, of little relevance in the cosmic
history of star-formation.

the fraction of galaxies with Halpha equivalent widths >10 A is 59%, compared
to 10% among SDSS galaxies of similar masses at z=0.1. Galaxies with weak
Halpha emission show absorption lines typical of 2-4 Gyr old stellar
populations. The structural parameters of the galaxies, derived from the
associated WFC3 F140W imaging data, correlate with the presence of Halpha:
quiescent galaxies are compact with high Sersic index and high inferred
velocity dispersion, whereas star-forming galaxies are typically large
two-armed spiral galaxies, with low Sersic index. Some of these star forming
galaxies might be progenitors of the most massive S0 and Sa galaxies. Our
results challenge the idea that galaxies at fixed mass form a homogeneous
population with small scatter in their properties. Instead we find that massive
galaxies form a highly diverse population at z>1, in marked contrast to the
local Universe.

counterparts to Chandra sources in the central square degree of the COSMOS

extends to faint magnitudes enabled photometric redshifts comparable to the
highest quality results presently available for normal galaxies. We demonstrate
that morphologically extended, faint X-ray sources without optical variability
are more accurately described by a library of normal galaxies (corrected for
emission lines) than by AGN-dominated templates, even if these sources have
AGN-like X-ray luminosities. Preselecting the library on the bases of the
source properties allowed us to reach an accuracy sigma_(Delta z/(1+z_spec))
\sim0.015 with a fraction of outliers of 5.8% for the entire Chandra-COSMOS
sample. In addition, we release revised photometric redshifts for the 1735
optical counterparts of the XMM-detected sources over the entire 2 sq. deg.of

previous release by Delta z>0.2. These changes are predominantly due to the
inclusion of newly available deep H-band photometry H_AB=24 mag. We illustrate
once again the importance of a spectroscopic training sample and how an
assumption about the nature of a source together with the number and the depth
of the available bands influence the accuracy of the photometric redshifts
determined for AGN. These considerations should be kept in mind when defining
the observational strategies of upcoming large surveys targeting AGN, such as
eROSITA at X-ray energies and ASKAP/EMU in the radio band.

Here we investigate to which extent such reduced information allows to forecast

in how far the lethality of eliminating nodes may be predicted by their network
centrality, such as degree and betweenness, without knowing the function of the

discrete Boolean dynamics. We investigate two types of stochastically generated
networks: fully random networks and structures grown with a mechanism of node
duplication and subsequent divergence of interactions. On all networks we find
that the out-degree is a good predictor of the lethality of a single node
knock-out. For knock-outs of node pairs, the fraction of successors shared
between the two knocked-out nodes (out-overlap) is a good predictor of
synthetic lethality. Out-degree and out-overlap are locally defined and
computationally simple centrality measures that provide a predictive power
close to the optimal predictor.

high sensitivity of these grism observations, with 1-sigma detections of
emission lines to f > 2.5x10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2, means that the galaxies in the
sample are typically ~7 times less massive (median M_* = 10^{9.5} M_sun) than
previously studied z~2 emission-line galaxies. Despite their lower mass, the
galaxies have OIII/Hb ratios which are very similar to previously studied z~2
galaxies and much higher than the typical emission-line ratios of local
galaxies. The WFC3 grism allows for unique studies of spatial gradients in
emission lines, and we stack the two-dimensional spectra of the galaxies for
this purpose. In the stacked data the OIII emission line is more spatially
concentrated than the Hb emission line with 98.1 confidence. We additionally
stack the X-ray data (all sources are individually undetected), and find that
the average L(OIII)/L(0.5-10 keV) ratio is intermediate between typical z~0
obscured active galaxies and star-forming galaxies. Together the compactness of
the stacked OIII spatial profile and the stacked X-ray data suggest that at
least some of these low-mass, low-metallicity galaxies harbor weak active
galactic nuclei.

of large scale magnetic fields has emerged from comparison of theoretical
models that incorporate the evolution of magnetic helicity with numerical
simulations for problems that are more idealized than expected in astrophysical
circumstances, but still fully non-linear. We carry out a new comparison of
this sort for the magnetic field growth from forced isotropic helical
turbulence in a periodic box. Previous comparisons be- tween analytic theory
and simulations of this problem have shown that a two-scale model compares well
with the simulations in agreeing that the driver of large scale field growth is
the difference between kinetic and current helicities associated with the small
scale field, and that the backreaction that slows the growth of the large scale
field as the small scale current helicity grows. However, the two-scale model
artificially re- stricts the small scale current helicity to reside at the same
scale as the driving kinetic helicity. In addition, previous comparisons have
focused on the late time saturation regime, and less on the early-time growth
regime. Here we address these issues by comparing a three scale model to new
simulations for both early and late time growth regimes. We find that the
minimalist extension to three scales provides a better model for the field
evolution than the two-scale model because the simulations show that the small
scale current helicity does not reside at the same scale as that of the driving
kinetic helicity. The simulations also show that the peak of the small scale
current helicity migrates toward lower wave numbers as the growth evolves from
the fast to saturated growth regimes.

errors in the estimated optical depths scale with the fractional continuum
error. However, traditional methods of estimating continua in noisy and
moderate-resolution spectra (S/N < 10 pixel^-1 and R ~ 2000, respectively, such
as SDSS) using power-law extrapolation or the mean spectrum, achieve no better
than ~ 10-15% RMS accuracy. To improve on this, we introduce mean-flux
regulated/principal component analysis (MF-PCA) continuum fitting. In this
technique, PCA fitting is carried out redwards of the quasar Lyman-alpha line
in order to provide a prediction for the shape of the Lyman-alpha forest
continuum. The slope and amplitude of this continuum prediction is then
corrected using external constraints for the Lyman-alpha forest mean-flux. From
tests on mock spectra, we find that MF-PCA reduces the errors to 8% RMS in S/N
~ 2 spectra, and < 5% RMS in spectra with S/N > 5. The residual Fourier power
in the continuum is decreased by a factor of a few in comparison with dividing
by the mean continuum, enabling Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum measurements to
be extended to ~2x larger scales. Using this new technique, we make available
continuum fits for 12,069 z>2.3 Lyman-alpha forest spectra from SDSS DR7 for
use by the community. This technique is also applicable to future releases of
the ongoing BOSS survey, which is obtaining spectra for ~ 150,000 Lyman-alpha

We extract a low-redshift sample (0.04 < z < 0.08) of early-type galaxies with
very low star-formation rates from the SDSS, based on a color-color selection
scheme and verified through the absence of emission lines in the spectra. The
inferred intrinsic shape distribution of these early-type galaxies is strongly
mass dependent: the typical short-to-long intrinsic axis-ratio of high-mass
early-type galaxies (>1e11 M_sun) is 2:3, where as at masses below 1e11 M_sun
this ratio narrows to 1:3, or more flattened galaxies. In an entirely analogous
manner we select a high-redshift sample (0.6 < z < 0.8) from two deep-field
surveys: GEMS and COSMOS. We find a seemingly universal mass of ~1e11 M_sun for
highly flatted early-type systems at all redshifts. This implies that the
process that grows an early-type galaxy above this ceiling mass involves
forming round systems. Using both parametric and non-parametric tests, we find
no evolution in the projected axis-ratio distribution for galaxies with masses
>3e10 M_sun with redshift. At the same time, our samples imply an increase of
2-3x in co-moving number density for early-type galaxies at masses >3e10 M_sun,
in agreement with previous studies. Given the direct connection between the
axis-ratio distribution and the underlying bulge-to-disk ratio distribution,
our findings imply that the number density evolution of early-type galaxies is
not exclusively driven by the emergence of either bulge- or disk-dominated
galaxies, but rather by a balanced mix that depends only on the stellar mass of
the galaxy. The challenge for galaxy formation models is to reproduce this
overall non-evolving ratio of flattened to round early-type galaxies in the
context of a continually growing population.

the PACS-CS collaboration. In particular S- and P-wave states of charmed and
charmed-strange mesons are explored for pion masses down to 156MeV. For the
heavy quark, the Fermilab method is employed. In addition to ground states,
some excited states are extracted using the variational method. To check our

charmonium, the low-lying spectrum agrees favorably with experiment. For

their ability to accurately predict class labels with groups of simple,

models that have good predictive capability they tend to be large and offer
little insight into the patterns or structure in a dataset. We consider an
ensemble technique that returns a model of ranked rules. The model accurately
predicts class labels and has the advantage of indicating which parameter
constraints are most useful for predicting those labels. An example of the rule
ensemble method successfully ranking rules and selecting attributes is given
with a dataset containing images of potential supernovas where the number of
necessary features is reduced from 39 to 21. We also compare the rule ensemble
method on a set of multi-class problems with boosting and bagging, which are
two well known ensemble techniques that use decision trees as base learners,

Perugia, Italy. Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic
of great importance for many application domains. For example, modern software
distributions are based on the notion of components, which denote units of
independent development and deployment. Components provide the necessary
flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution, but also are a
challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large repository of
possible choices, and configuring these components according to user needs,
resource constraints, and interdependencies with other components. Some
well-known examples of complex systems of components in the world of Free and
Open Source software are the different distributions for GNU/Linux, BSD, or
Eclipse plugins. The LoCoCo workshop focus on logic-based methods for
specifying and solving complex configuration problems. The goal of the workshop
was to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in the area of
component configuration of systems, using different modeling and solving
techniques, such as constraint and logic programming, description logics,
satisfiability and its extensions. The workshop was an opportunity to discuss
common and complementary solutions for solving component configuration.

to describe nuclear masses for nuclei in various deformation regions.
Separating the 2149 measured nuclear species in eight sets with similar
quadrupole deformations, we show that the masses of prolate deformed nuclei are
better described than those of spherical ones. In fact, the prolate deformed
nuclei are fitted with an RMS smaller than 750 keV, while for spherical and
semi-magic species the RMS is always larger than 2000 keV. These results are
found to be independent of pairing.
  The macroscopic sector of the Duflo-Zuker (DZ) mass model reproduces shell
effects, while most of the deformation dependence is lost and the RMS is larger
than in any LDM. Adding to the LDM the microscopically motivated DZ master
terms introduces the shell effects, allowing for a significant reduction in the
RMS of the fit but still exhibiting a better description of prolate deformed
nuclei. The inclusion of shell effects following the Interacting Boson Model's
ideas produces similar results.

employed in a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of zero-field-cooled/field-cooled

Simulations are aimed to draw a realistic picture of the as-produced ultra-thin

(ZFC/FC and $M \times H$ curves) between experiments and simulations regarding
the maximum of the ZFC curve ($T_{\scriptsize MAX}$), remanence ($M_R/M_s$) and
coercivity ($H_C$) revealed the great accuracy of the multistage approach
proposed here while providing information about the system's morphology and
magnetic properties. For a typical sample the value we found experimentally for
$T_{\scriptsize MAX}$ (54 K) was very close to the value provided by the
simulation (53 K). For the parameters depending on the nanoparticle clustering
the experimental values were consistently lower ($M_R/M_s$ = 0.32 and $H_C$ =

extending our techniques to work with the infinite dimensional Lie algebra of

construct a highly nontrivial four dimensional SAYD module over the Schwarzian

that phonons can be manipulated like electrons and photons can, thus enabling
controlled heat transport. Moreover, we explain that phonons can be put to
beneficial use to carry and process information. In a first part we present
ways to control heat transport and how to process information for physical
systems which are driven by a temperature bias. Particularly, we put forward
the toolkit of familiar electronic analogs for exercising phononics; i.e.
phononic devices which act as thermal diodes, thermal transistors, thermal
logic gates and thermal memories, etc.. These concepts are then put to work to
transport, control and rectify heat in physical realistic nanosystems by
devising practical designs of hybrid nanostructures that permit the operation
of functional phononic devices and, as well, report first experimental
realizations. Next, we discuss yet richer possibilities to manipulate heat flow
by use of time varying thermal bath temperatures or various other external
fields. These give rise to a plenty of intriguing phononic nonequilibrium
phenomena as for example the directed shuttling of heat, a geometrical phase
induced heat pumping, or the phonon Hall effect, that all may find its way into

networks. It allows nodes to transmit simultaneously. Due to the difficulties
of scheduling simultaneous transmissions, existing works on PNC are based on
simplified medium access control (MAC) protocols, which are not applicable to
general multi-hop wireless networks, to the best of our knowledge. In this
paper, we propose a distributed MAC protocol that supports PNC in multi-hop
wireless networks. The proposed MAC protocol is based on the carrier sense
multiple access (CSMA) strategy and can be regarded as an extension to the IEEE
802.11 MAC protocol. In the proposed protocol, each node collects information
on the queue status of its neighboring nodes. When a node finds that there is
an opportunity for some of its neighbors to perform PNC, it notifies its
corresponding neighboring nodes and initiates the process of packet exchange
using PNC, with the node itself as a relay. During the packet exchange process,
the relay also works as a coordinator which coordinates the transmission of
source nodes. Meanwhile, the proposed protocol is compatible with conventional
network coding and conventional transmission schemes. Simulation results show
that the proposed protocol is advantageous in various scenarios of wireless
applications.

agreement with that of Fermi liquid. Especially, the dispersion relation is
linear. It is very different from that found in the extremal
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m (RN) black hole for massless fermion, which is
obviously non-Fermi liquid due to a nonlinear dispersion relation. However, for
another scaling behavior of the height of $ImG_{11}$ at the maximum, the
scaling exponent is not one, which is at odds with that found in the RN black
hole.

description and characterization of a rich variety of continuous-time
stochastic processes. The cornerstone of our approach is an innovation model
that is driven by some generalized white noise process, which may be Gaussian
or not (e.g., Laplace, impulsive Poisson or alpha stable). This allows for a
conceptual decoupling between the correlation properties of the process, which
are imposed by the whitening operator L, and its sparsity pattern which is
determined by the type of noise excitation. The latter is fully specified by a
Levy measure. We show that the range of admissible innovation behavior varies
between the purely Gaussian and super-sparse extremes. We prove that the
corresponding generalized stochastic processes are well-defined mathematically
provided that the (adjoint) inverse of the whitening operator satisfies some Lp
bound for p>=1. We present a novel operator-based method that yields an
explicit characterization of all Levy-driven processes that are solutions of
constant-coefficient stochastic differential equations. When the underlying
system is stable, we recover the family of stationary CARMA processes,
including the Gaussian ones. The approach remains valid when the system is
unstable and leads to the identification of potentially useful generalizations
of the Levy processes, which are sparse and non-stationary. Finally, we show
how we can apply finite difference operators to obtain a stationary
characterization of these processes that is maximally decoupled and stable,

(continuous-time autoregressive moving average) processes that are solutions of
stochastic differential equations driven by white Levy innovations. These are
completely specified by: (1) a set of poles and zeros that fixes their
correlation structure, and (2) a canonical infinitely-divisible probability
distribution that controls their degree of sparsity (with the Gaussian model
corresponding to the least sparse scenario). The generalized CARMA processes
are either stationary or non-stationary, depending on the location of the poles
in the complex plane. The most basic non-stationary representatives (with a
single pole at the origin) are the Levy processes, which are the non-Gaussian
counterparts of Brownian motion. We focus on the general analog-to-discrete
conversion problem and introduce a novel spline-based formalism that greatly
simplifies the derivation of the correlation properties and joint probability
distributions of the discrete versions of these processes. We also rely on the
concept of generalized increment process, which suppresses all long range
dependencies, to specify an equivalent discrete-domain innovation model. A
crucial ingredient is the existence of a minimally-supported function
associated with the whitening operator L; this B-spline, which is fundamental
to our formulation, appears in most of our formulas, both at the level of the
correlation and the characteristic function. We make use of these
discrete-domain results to numerically generate illustrative examples of sparse
signals that are consistent with the continuous-domain model.

delocalization of electronic states in the vicinity of the maximum of the
narrow impurity band. A possibility of such delocalization at relatively small
impurity concentration is related to the small width of the impurity band
characterized by weak disorder. In this case the carriers were activated from
the ""bandtail"" while its presence was related to weak background compensation.
Here we study an effect of the extrinsic compensation and of the impurity
concentration on this ""virtual"" Anderson transition. It was shown that an
increase of compensation initially does not affect the Anderson transition,
however at strong compensations the transition is suppressed due to increase of
disorder. In its turn, an increase of the dopant concentration initially leads
to a suppression of the transition due an increase of disorder, the latter
resulting from a partial overlap of the Hubbard bands. However at larger
concentration the conductivity becomes to be metallic due to Mott transition.

evolutionary process of AGB stars. The difference between the spatial
distributions of C-rich and oxygen-rich (O-rich) AGB stars is essential for the
study of the Galactic structure and the chemical evolution of the interstellar
medium (ISM). Aims: We quantitatively investigate the spatial distributions of
C-rich and O-rich AGB stars in our Galaxy. We discuss the difference between
them and its origin. Methods: We classify a large number of AGB stars newly
detected by the AKARI id-infrared all-sky survey. In the color-color diagrams,
we define their occupation zones based on the locations of known objects. We
then obtain the spatial distributions of C-rich and O-rich AGB stars, assuming
that they have the same luminosity for a given mass-loss rate. Results: We find
that O-rich AGB stars are concentrated toward the Galactic center and that the
density decreases with Galactocentric distance, whereas C-rich AGB stars show a
relatively uniform distribution within about 8kpc of Sun. Conclusion: Our
result confirms the trends reported in previous studies and extends them to a
Galactic scale. We discuss the relations between our result, the Galactic

silica encapsulation process described here has several advantages, including
fast preparation and high SWNT loading concentration, over other encapsulation
methods used to prepare fluorescent SWNT/silica nanocomposites. Further,
addition of glycerol to SWNT suspensions prior to performing the CViL sol-gel
process allows for the preparation of freestanding fluorescent silica xerogels,
which to the best of our knowledge is the first report of such nanocomposites.
Our spectroscopic data on SWNTs suspended in aqueous surfactants or

decreased sensitivity of SWNT emission response to changes imparted by the
local environment. In addition, silica encapsulation can be used to ""lock-in"" a
surfactant micelle structure surrounding SWNTs to minimize interactions between
SWNTs and ions/small molecules. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that one
should consider a balance between maximum PL intensity and the ability to sense
environmental changes when designing new SWNT systems for future sensing
applications.

desorb when the pulling force on it exceeds a critical value $f_{c}$. We
formulate an equation for the average position of the $n^{th}$ monomer, which
takes into account excluded volume interaction through the blob-picture of a
polymer under external constraints. The approach leads to a diffusion equation
with a $p$-Laplacian for the propagation of the stretching along the chain.
This has to be solved subject to a moving boundary condition. Interestingly,
within this approach, the problem can be solved exactly in the trumpet,
stem-flower and stem regimes. In the trumpet regime, we get
$\tau=\tau_{0}n_d^{2}$ where $n_d$ is the number of monomers that have desorbed
at the time $\tau$. $\tau_{0}$ is known only numerically, but for $f$ close to
$f_{c}$, it is found to be $\tau_{0}\sim f_c/(f^{2/3}-f_{c}^{2/3})$. If one
used simple Rouse dynamics, this result changes to {\normalsize $\tau\sim f_c

of interaction, Uc*, which can be promoted as the crossover point from coherent
to incoherent regimes and can be identified as the collapse threshold.
Moreover, we find that the Fisher information is always in direct ratio to the
variance of on-site number of bosons, for both positive and negative

Uc* and exceeds its coherent value within the whole range of interaction

influenced by condensation and evaporation. The problem is set in a periodic
domain and employs simple evaporation and condensation schemes, wherein both
the processes push parcels towards saturation. Numerical simulations
demonstrate the emergence of a moist turbulent state consisting of ordered
structures with a clear power-law type spectral scaling from initially
spatially uncorrelated conditions. An asymptotic analysis in the limit of rapid
condensation and strong stratification shows that, for initial conditions with
enough water substance to saturate the domain, the equations support a
straightforward state of moist balance characterized by a hydrostatic,
saturated, vertically sheared horizontal flow (VSHF). For such initial
conditions, by means of long time numerical simulations, the emergence of moist
balance is verified. Specifically, starting from uncorrelated data, subsequent
to the development of a moist turbulent state, the system experiences a rather
abrupt transition to a regime which is close to saturation and dominated by a
strong VSHF. On the other hand, initial conditions which do not have enough
water substance to saturate the domain, do not attain moist balance. Rather,
the system remains in a turbulent state and oscillates about moist balance.
Even though balance is not achieved with these general initial conditions, the
time scale of oscillation about moist balance is much larger than the imposed
time scale of condensation and evaporation, thus indicating a distinct dominant
slow component in the moist stratified two-dimensional turbulent system.

both sectors present energy stability for sufficiently small values of the

infinite r-th moment for any r<3, due to the loss of tightness caused by a few
isolated 1's appearing deep within the regions of all 0's (and vice versa) at
exceptional times. In this note, we show that as long as p has a finite second
moment, the measure-valued process induced by the rescaled voter model
configuration is tight, and converges weakly to the measure-valued process
1_{x<B_t}dx, t>0.

The melt was dumped from a Pt-crucible with a downpipe in water which resulted
in the formation of phase separated droplets with a size of around 100 - 150
nm. In this droplets, magnetite crystals with a size of around 10-20 nm were
observed. These magnetite nanoparticles with superparamagnetic behaviour are
arranged to larger aggregates. This leads to a higher effective magnetic
radius. According to magnetisation measurements the particles show hysteresis.
The ratio of remanent vs. saturation magnetisation is not as high as it is
necessary for uniaxial anisotropy. It is possible to elude the phase
separations by cooking the pulverized glass in concentrated sodium hydroxide.
Additional temperature dependent magnetorelaxometry (TMRX) measurements show in
the distribution of the relaxation of magnetic moments over the course of

smaller than 5 dC (the core diameter) could that be a result of strong magnetic

random shear flow, is studied by means of the field theoretic renormalization
group and the operator product expansion. The advecting velocity is Gaussian,
white in time, with correlation function of the form $\propto \delta(t-t') /
k_{\bot}^{d-1+\xi}$, where $k_{\bot}=|{\bf k}_{\bot}|$ and ${\bf k}_{\bot}$ is
the component of the wave vector, perpendicular to the distinguished direction
(`direction of the flow') --- the $d$-dimensional generalization of the
ensemble introduced by Avellaneda and Majda [{\it Commun. Math. Phys.} {\bf
131}: 381 (1990)]. The structure functions of the scalar field in the infrared
range exhibit scaling behaviour with exactly known critical dimensions. It is
strongly anisotropic in the sense that the dimensions related to the directions
parallel and perpendicular to the flow are essentially different. In contrast
to the isotropic Kraichnan's rapid-change model, the structure functions show
no anomalous (multi)scaling and have finite limits when the integral turbulence
scale tends to infinity. On the contrary, the dependence of the internal scale
(or diffusivity coefficient) persists in the infrared range. Generalization to
the velocity field with a finite correlation time is also obtained. Depending
on the relation between the exponents in the energy spectrum ${\cal E} \propto
k_{\bot}^{1-\epsilon}$ and in the dispersion law $\omega \propto
k_{\bot}^{2-\eta}$, the infrared behaviour of the model is given by the limits
of vanishing or infinite correlation time, with the crossover at the ray
$\eta=0$, $\epsilon>0$ in the $\epsilon$--$\eta$ plane. The physical
(Kolmogorov) point $\epsilon=8/3$, $\eta=4/3$ lies inside the domain of
stability of the rapid-change regime; there is no crossover line going through
this point.

to intermediately inclined spiral galaxies and assess the effect of the galaxy
environment on the azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness mu profiles
for each galaxy in the outer stellar disc (24 < mu < 26.5 mag per sq arcsec).
For galaxies with a purely exponential outer disc (~50 per cent), we determine
the significance of an environmental dependence on the outer disc scalelength
h_out. For galaxies with a broken exponential in their outer disc, either
down-bending (truncation, ~10 per cent) or up-bending (anti-truncation, ~40 per
cent), we measure the strength T (outer-to-inner scalelength ratio,
log_10(h_out/h_in) of the mu breaks and determine the significance of an
environmental dependence on break strength T. Surprisingly, we find no evidence
to suggest any such environmental dependence on either outer disc scalelength
h_out or break strength T, implying that the galaxy environment is not
affecting the stellar distribution in the outer stellar disc. We also find that
for galaxies with small effective radii (r_e < 3 kpc) there is a lack of outer

which states that spacetime singularities are never observed by a distant

Furthermore, we argue that all the back reaction effects can be properly taken
into account when we consider the trajectory of a particle on the border
between the plunge and bounce orbits. In such marginal cases we find that the
Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black hole can never be overcharged via the absorption
of a charged particle. Since all the plunge orbits are expected to have a

evidence that indicates the violation of the cosmic censorship in the proposed

the measurements of all sensors. We propose a distributed method for computing,
at each sensor, an approximation of the JLF by means of consensus algorithms.
This ""likelihood consensus"" method is applicable if the local likelihood
functions of the various sensors (viewed as conditional probability density
functions of the local measurements) belong to the exponential family of
distributions. We then use the likelihood consensus method to implement a
distributed particle filter and a distributed Gaussian particle filter. Each
sensor runs a local particle filter, or a local Gaussian particle filter, that
computes a global state estimate. The weight update in each local (Gaussian)
particle filter employs the JLF, which is obtained through the likelihood
consensus scheme. For the distributed Gaussian particle filter, the number of

scheme. Simulation results are presented to assess the performance of the

its conductance is reduced because of the circuit back-action. This phenomenon,
called environmental Coulomb blockade, results from the granularity of charge
transfers across the coherent conductor. Although extensively studied for a
tunnel junction in a linear circuit, it is only fully understood for arbitrary
short coherent conductors in the limit of small circuit impedances and small
conductance reduction. Here, we investigate experimentally the strong
back-action regime, with a conductance reduction of up to 90%. This is achieved
by embedding a single quantum channel of tunable transmission in an adjustable
on-chip circuit of impedance comparable to the resistance quantum $R_K=h/e^2$

calculations performed in the weak back-action framework, and matches with
recent theoretical results. From these measurements, we propose a generalized

systems is described. The problem is considered as a combination of selected
design alternatives for system parts/components into a resultant composite
decision (i.e., system configuration design). The solving framework is based on
Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD) approach: (i)
multicriteria selection of alternatives for system parts, (ii) composing the
selected alternatives into a resultant combination (while taking into account
ordinal quality of the alternatives above and their compatibility). A
lattice-based discrete space is used to evaluate (to integrate) quality of the
resultant combinations (i.e., composite system decisions or system
configurations). In addition, a simplified solving framework based on
multicriteria multiple choice problem is considered. A multistage design
process to obtain a system trajectory is described as well. The basic applied
example is targeted to an applied Web-based system for a communication service
provider. Two other applications are briefly described (corporate system and
information system for academic application).

upward, which maintains the particles suspended upon average. Two density
ratios were simulated, differing by a factor of 4.5. The corresponding Stokes

the turbulence intensity as well as the normal stress anisotropy are strongly
increased. The effect of varying the Stokes number while maintaining the

which they differ is shown to be the variance of the spin along a given

states as given by its density matrix, although sufficient in many cases,
should be considered incomplete, as it does not fully describe the measurable
characteristics of the ensemble. A discussion a posteriori on the problem is

with each model giving rise to a different surface coverage and mobility of the
adsorbed phase. We find that the local structure and mobility of the adsorbed
phase remains relatively uniform across all segments of an elongating AuNW,
except for the thinning region of the wire where the high mobility of Au atoms
disrupts the monolayer structure, giving rise to higher solvent mobility. We
analyzed the AuNW trajectories by measuring the ductile elongation of the wires
and detecting the presence of characteristic structural motifs that appeared
during elongation. Our findings indicate that adsorbates facilitate the
formation of high-energy structural motifs and lead to significantly higher
ductile elongations. In particular, our simulations result in a large number of
monatomic chains and helical structures possessing mechanical stability in
excess of what we observe in vacuum. Conversely, we find that a molecular
species that interacts weakly (i.e., does not adsorb) with AuNWs worsens the
mechanical stability of monatomic chains.

spectrophotometric study of the stellar content of the compact H II region
Sh2-152.
  Aims: We aim to determine the distance, extinction, age, and mass of Sh2-152,
using for the first time near-infrared stellar classification for several
sources in the region.
  Methods: Using our near-infrared (J, H, and Ks) photometry and the
colour-magnitude diagram for the cluster field, we selected 13 bright stars,
candidate members of the reddened cluster's main sequence, for H- and K-
spectroscopy and spectral classification. This near-infrared information was
complemented with an optical spectrum of the ionizing central star to confirm
its spectral nature.
  Results: From the 13 spectroscopically observed stars, 5 were classified as
B-type, 3 as G-type, 2 were young stellar objects (YSOs), and 3 remained
unclassified (because of the poor data quality). The cluster's extinction
varies from A_{Ks}=0.5 to 2.6 magnitudes (A_V=4.5 to 24 magnitudes) and the
distance is estimated to be 3.21\pm0.21 kpc. The age of the cluster is younger
than 9.4 Myr and the lower limit to the total mass of the cluster is
(2.45\pm0.79)\cdot10^3 M_{Sun}. We compare the number of ionizing photons
emitted from the OB-type stars with the Lyman continuum photons derived from
the radio observations and conclude that both quantities are consistent for the
central region of Sh2-152. In contrast, the main ionizing source of the lower
region remains unidentified.

grand canonically, their influence being parameterized in terms of their
packing fraction in the reservoir, \eta_s^r. Two specialized Monte Carlo
simulation schemes --the geometrical cluster algorithm, and staged particle
insertion-- are deployed to obtain accurate depletion potentials for a number
of combinations of q\leq 0.1 and \eta_s^r. After applying corrections for
simulation finite-size effects, the depletion potentials are compared with the
prediction of new density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the
insertion trick using the Rosenfeld functional and several subsequent
modifications. While agreement between the DFT and simulation is generally
good, significant discrepancies are evident at the largest reservoir packing
fraction accessible to our simulation methods, namely \eta_s^r=0.35. These
discrepancies are, however, small compared to those between simulation and the
much poorer predictions of the Derjaguin approximation at this \eta_s^r. The
recently proposed morphometric approximation performs better than Derjaguin but
is somewhat poorer than DFT for the size ratios and small sphere packing
fractions that we consider. The effective potentials from simulation, DFT and
the morphometric approximation were used to compute the second virial
coefficient B_2 as a function of \eta_s^r. Comparison of the results enables an
assessment of the extent to which DFT can be expected to correctly predict the
propensity towards fluid fluid phase separation in additive binary hard sphere
mixtures with q\leq 0.1.

shortcomings of General Relativity at infrared and ultraviolet scales. They are
an approach that, by preserving the undoubtedly positive results of Einstein's

emerged in Astrophysics, Cosmology and High Energy Physics. In particular, the
goal is to encompass, in a self-consistent scheme, problems like Inflation,
Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Large Scale Structure and, first of all, to give at
least an effective description of Quantum Gravity. We review the basic
principles that any gravitational theory has to follow. The geometrical
interpretation is discussed in a broad perspective in order to highlight the
basic assumptions of General Relativity and its possible extensions in the
general framework of gauge theories. Principles of such modifications are
presented, focusing on specific classes of theories like f (R)-gravity and
scalar-tensor gravity in the metric and Palatini approaches. The special role
of torsion is also discussed. The conceptual features of these theories are
fully explored and attention is payed to the issues of dynamical and conformal
equivalence between them considering also the initial value problem. A number
of viability criteria are presented considering the post-Newtonian and the

between l=20 and 44 degrees and |b| < 4 degrees, using Radio Recombination Line
(RRL) data from the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS). Following an upgrade on
the RRL data reduction technique, which improves significantly the quality of
the final RRL spectra, we have extended the analysis to three times the area
covered in Alves et al. (2010). The final RRL map has an angular resolution of
14.8 arcmin and a velocity resolution of 20 km/s.
  A map of the electron temperature (Te) of the ionised gas is derived for the
area under study using the line and continuum data from the present survey. The
mean Te on the Galactic plane is 6000 K. The first direct measure of the
free-free emission is obtained based on the derived Te map. Subtraction of this
thermal component from the total continuum leaves the first direct measure of
the synchrotron emission at 1.4 GHz. A narrow component of width 2 degrees is
identified in the latitude distribution of the synchrotron emission. We present
a list of HII regions and SNRs extracted from the present free-free and
synchrotron maps, where we confirm the synchrotron nature of three objects:
G41.12-0.21, G41.15+0.39 and G35.59-0.44. We also identify a bright (42 Jy) new
double radio galaxy, J1841-0152, previously unrecognised owing to the high
optical extinction in the region.
  The latitude distribution for the RRL-derived free-free emission shows that
the WMAP Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) is too high by ~ 50 per cent, in
agreement with other recent results. The extension of this study to the inner

physics reach requires knowledge of the state of polarisation as precisely as
possible. The polarised beams can undergo depolarisation due to various
mechanisms. In order to quantify the uncertainty due to depolarisation, spin
tracking simulations in the International Linear Collider (ILC) Beam Delivery
System (BDS) and at the Interaction Point (IP) have been performed. Spin
tracking in the BDS was achieved using the BMAD subroutine library, and the
CAIN program was used to do spin tracking through the beam-beam collision.
Assuming initially aligned beamline elements in the BDS, a ground motion model
was applied to obtain realistic random misalignments over various time scales.
Depolarisation at the level of 0.1% occurs within a day of ground motion at a
noisy site. Depolarisation at the IP also exceeds 0.1% for the nominal
parameter sets for both the ILC and for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).
Theoretical work is underway to include radiative corrections in the
depolarisation processes and simulation of the depolarisation through the
entire collider is envisaged.

investigate the spatial distribution of the inner regions of the disrupting
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr). We combine previously published
analyses of four Sgr member clusters located near or in the Sgr core (M54, Arp
2, Terzan 7 and Terzan 8) with a new analysis of diffuse Sgr material
identified in the background of five low-latitude Galactic bulge clusters (NGC
6624, 6637, 6652, 6681 and 6809) observed as part of the ACS survey. By
comparing the bulge cluster CMDs to our previous analysis of the M54/Sgr core,
we estimate distances to these background features. The combined data from four
Sgr member clusters and five Sgr background features provides nine independent
measures of the Sgr distance and, as a group, provide uniformly measured and
calibrated probes of different parts of the inner regions of Sgr spanning
twenty degrees over the face of the disrupting dwarf. This allows us, for the
first time, to constrain the three dimensional orientation of Sgr's disrupting
core and globular cluster system and compare that orientation to the
predictions of an N-body model of tidal disruption. The density and distance of
Sgr debris is consistent with models that favor a relatively high Sgr core mass
and a slightly greater distance (28-30 kpc, with a mean of 29.4 kpc). Our
analysis also suggests that M54 is in the foreground of Sgr by ~2 kpc,
projected on the center of the Sgr dSph. While this would imply a remarkable
alignment of the cluster and the Sgr nucleus along the line of sight, we can
not identify any systematic effect in our analysis that would falsely create
the measured 2 kpc separation. Finally, we find that the cluster Terzan 7 has
the most discrepant distance (25 kpc) among the four Sgr core clusters, which
may suggest a different dynamical history than the other Sgr core clusters.

first that displayed X-ray eclipses. Therefore it holds a great potential for
accurate mass measurements in a low mass X-ray binary system. The determination
of the companion star radial velocity would make it possible to fully resolve
the system and to accurately measure the mass of the neutron star based on
dynamical measurements. Unfortunately, no optical/NIR counterpart has been
identified to date for this system, either in outburst or in quiescence. We
performed a photometric study of the field of Swift J1749.4-2807 during
quiescence in order to search for the presence of a variable counterpart. The
source direction lies on the Galactic plane, making any search for its
optical/NIR counterpart challenging. To minimize the effects of field crowding
and interstellar extinction, we carried out our observations using the adaptive
optics near-infrared imager NACO mounted at the ESO Very Large Telescope. From
the analysis of Swift X-ray data obtained during outburst, we derived the most
precise (1.6"" radius) position for this source. Due to the extreme stellar
crowding of the field, 41 sources are detected in our VLT images within the
X-ray error circle, with some of them possibly showing variability consistent
with the expectations. We carried out the first deep imaging campaign devoted
to the search of the quiescent NIR counterpart of Swift J1749.4-2807. Our
results allow to provide constraints on the nature of the companion star of
this system. Furthermore, they suggest that future phase-resolved NIR
observations (performed with large aperture telescopes and adaptive optics)
covering the full orbital period of the system are likely to identify the
quiescent counterpart of Swift J1749.4-2807, through the measure of its orbital
variability, opening the possibility of dynamical studies of this unique
source.

reducing the quality of the multimedia data. The transition and storing of
compressed multimedia data is much faster and more efficient than original
uncompressed multimedia data. There are various techniques and standards for
multimedia data compression, especially for image compression such as the JPEG

color space conversion and entropy coding. Arithmetic and Huffman coding are
normally used in the entropy coding phase. In this paper we try to answer the
following question. Which entropy coding, arithmetic or Huffman, is more
suitable compared to other from the compression ratio, performance, and
implementation points of view? We have implemented and tested Huffman and
arithmetic algorithms. Our implemented results show that compression ratio of
arithmetic coding is better than Huffman coding, while the performance of the
Huffman coding is higher than Arithmetic coding. In addition, implementation of
Huffman coding is much easier than the Arithmetic coding.
