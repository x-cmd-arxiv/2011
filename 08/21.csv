neutron star in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A over the past 10 years--as
well as all other reliably known temperature data of neutron stars--can be
comfortably explained within the ""nuclear medium cooling"" scenario. The cooling
rates of this scenario account for medium-modified one-pion exchange in dense
matter and polarization effects in the pair-breaking formations of superfluid
neutrons and protons. Crucial for the successful description of the observed
data is a substantial reduction of the thermal conductivity, resulting from a
suppression of both the electron and nucleon contributions to it by medium
effects. We also find that possibly in as little as about ten years of
continued observation, the data may tell whether or not fast cooling processes
are active in this neutron star.

principled framework for the modular design of object-level ontologies. The IFF
represents meta-logic, and as such operates at the structural level of
ontologies. In the IFF, there is a precise boundary between the metalevel and
the object level. The modular architecture of the IFF consists of metalevels,
namespaces and meta-ontologies. Each metalevel services the levels below by
providing a metalanguage used to declare and axiomatize those levels.
Corresponding to the metalevels are nested metalanguages, where each
metalanguage axiomatization includes specialization of the one immediately
above. Within each metalevel, the terminology is partitioned into namespaces,
and various namespaces are collected together into meaningful composites called
meta-ontologies. All of the various meta-ontologies in the IFF are anchored to

these models with both precision cosmological data (probing the CMB decoupling

LambdaCDM model, such sterile neutrinos are strongly disfavoured by current
data because they contribute too much hot dark matter. However, if the
cosmological framework is extended to include also additional relativistic
degrees of freedom -- beyond the three standard neutrinos and the putative
sterile neutrinos, then the hot dark matter constraint on the sterile states is
considerably relaxed. A further improvement is achieved by allowing a dark
energy equation of state parameter w<-1. While BBN strongly disfavours extra
radiation beyond the assumed eV-mass sterile neutrino, this constraint can be
circumvented by a small nu_e degeneracy. Any model containing eV-mass sterile
neutrinos implies also strong modifications of other cosmological parameters.

$k$ identical items for sale and is facing $n$ potential buyers (""agents"") that
are arriving sequentially. Each agent is interested in buying one item. Each
agent's value for an item is an IID sample from some fixed distribution with
support $[0,1]$. The seller offers a take-it-or-leave-it price to each arriving
agent (possibly different for different agents), and aims to maximize his
expected revenue.
  We focus on ""prior-independent"" mechanisms -- ones that do not use any
information about the distribution. They are desirable because knowing the
distribution is unrealistic in many practical scenarios. We study how the
revenue of such mechanisms compares to the revenue of the optimal offline
mechanism that knows the distribution (""offline benchmark"").
  We present a prior-independent dynamic pricing mechanism whose revenue is at
most $O((k \log n)^{2/3})$ less than the offline benchmark, for every
distribution that is regular. In fact, this guarantee holds without *any*
assumptions if the benchmark is relaxed to fixed-price mechanisms. Further, we
prove a matching lower bound. The performance guarantee for the same mechanism
can be improved to $O(\sqrt{k} \log n)$, with a distribution-dependent
constant, if $k/n$ is sufficiently small. We show that, in the worst case over
all demand distributions, this is essentially the best rate that can be
obtained with a distribution-specific constant.
  On a technical level, we exploit the connection to multi-armed bandits (MAB).
While dynamic pricing with unlimited supply can easily be seen as an MAB
problem, the intuition behind MAB approaches breaks when applied to the setting
with limited supply. Our high-level conceptual contribution is that even the
limited supply setting can be fruitfully treated as a bandit problem.

appropriate for nuclear shell-model studies, with particular emphasis on the
monopole term of the interactions. Standard nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interactions
such as AV8' and $\chi$N$^3$LO are tailored to shell-model studies by employing
$V_{low k}$ techniques to handle the short-range repulsion of the $NN$
interactions and by applying many-body perturbation theory to incorporate
in-medium effects. We show, via numerical studies of effective interactions for
the $sd$ and $pf$ shells, that the tensor-force contribution to the monopole
term of the effective interaction is barely changed by these renormalization
procedures, resulting in almost the same monopole term as the one of the bare
$NN$ interactions. We propose to call this feature {\it Renormalization
Persistency} of the tensor force, as it is a remarkable property of the
renormalization and should have many interesting consequences in nuclear
systems. For higher multipole terms, this feature is maintained to a somewhat
smaller extent. We present general intuitive explanations for the
renormalization persistency of the tensor force, as well as analyses of
core-polarization terms in perturbation theory. The central force does not
exhibit a similar renormalization persistency.

We observe a solar jet at north polar coronal hole (NPCH) using SDO
AIA 304 {\deg}A image data on 3 August 2010. The jet rises obliquely above the
solar limb and then retraces its propagation path to fall back. Aims. We
numerically model this observed solar jet by implementing a realistic (VAL-C)
model of solar temperature. Methods. We solve two-dimensional ideal
magnetohydrodynamic equations numerically to simulate the observed solar jet.
We consider a localized velocity pulse that is essentially parallel to the
background magnetic field lines and initially launched at the top of the solar
photosphere. The pulse steepens into a shock at higher altitudes, which
triggers plasma perturbations that exhibit the observed features of the jet.
The typical direction of the pulse also clearly exhibits the leading front of
the moving jet. Results. Our numerical simulations reveal that a large
amplitude initial velocity pulse launched at the top of the solar photosphere
produces in general the observed properties of the jet, e.g., upward and
backward average velocities, height, width, life-time, and ballistic nature.
Conclusions. The close matching between the jet observations and numerical
simulations provides first strong evidence for the formation of this jet by a
single velocity pulse. The strong velocity pulse is most likely generated by
the low- atmospheric reconnection in the polar region which results in
triggering of the jet. The downflowing material of the jet most likely vanishes
in the next upcoming velocity pulses from lower solar atmosphere, and therefore
distinctly launched a single jet upward in the solar atmosphere is observed.

network traffic. For example, it is demonstrated that there is a great amount
of redundancy within the content of a server over time. This redundancy can be
leveraged to reduce the network flow by the deployment of memory units in the

can result in a fundamental improvement in the performance of the network. In
this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by first establishing the
fundamental gains of memory-assisted source compression and then applying the
technique to a network. Specifically, we investigate the gain of
memory-assisted compression in random network graphs consisted of a single
source and several randomly selected memory units. We find a threshold value
for the number of memories deployed in a random graph and show that if the

The further shortening of the average migration length is observed if the

escaping from optically thick medium has a time scale as long as the age of the

time-independent, or stationary solutions of the Ly$\alpha$ photon transfer
with resonant scattering will overlook important features of the escaped
Ly$\alpha$ photons in physical and frequency spaces. More seriously, the
expansion of the universe leads to that the time-independent solutions of the
Ly$\alpha$ photon transfer may not exist. We show that time-dependent solutions
sometimes are essential for understanding the Ly$\alpha$ emission and
absorption at high redshifts. For Ly\alpha photons from sources at redshift
1+z=10 and being surrounded by neutral hydrogen IGM of the $\Lambda$CDM

discrete Fourier transforms over finite fields, which have widespread
applications in cryptography and error control codes. They are of great
interest because of their low multiplicative and overall complexities. However,
their advantages are shown by inspection in the literature, and there is no
asymptotic computational complexity analysis for CFFTs. Their high additive
complexity also incurs difficulties in hardware implementations. In this paper,
we derive the bounds for the multiplicative and additive complexities of CFFTs,
respectively. Our results confirm that CFFTs have the smallest multiplicative
complexities among all known algorithms while their additive complexities
render them asymptotically suboptimal. However, CFFTs remain valuable as they
have the smallest overall complexities for most practical lengths. Our additive
complexity analysis also leads to a structured addition network, which not only
has low complexity but also is suitable for hardware implementations.

present numerical results for ground state as well as thermodynamic properties.
In this system the ground state bond distortion pattern is independent of
electron-electron interaction strength. The spin gap in the ground state of the
zigzag ladder increases with the degree of frustration. Unlike in
one-dimension, where the spin-gap and charge ordering transitions can be
distinct, we show that in the ladder they occur simultaneously. We discuss spin
gap and charge ordering transitions in 1/4-filled materials with one, two, or

temperature the magnetic susceptibility of the t-J model is calculated using
the Mori projection operator technique. Conditions for the appearance of an
incommensurate magnetic response below the resonance frequency are identified.
A fast decay of the tails of the hole coherent peaks and a weak intensity of
the hole incoherent continuum near the Fermi level are enough to produce an
incommensurate response using different hole dispersions established for
$p$-type cuprates, in which such response was observed. In this case, the
nesting of the itinerant-electron theory or the charge modulation of the stripe
theory is unnecessary for the incommensurability. The theory reproduces the
hourglass dispersion of the susceptibility maxima with their location in the
momentum space similar to that observed experimentally. The upper branch of the
dispersion stems from the excitations of localized spins, while the lower one
is due to the incommensurate maxima of their damping. The narrow and intensive
resonance peak arises if the frequency of these excitations at the
antiferromagnetic momentum lies below the edge of the two-fermion continuum;
otherwise the maximum is broad and less intensive.

highly nonlinear switching behaviour as a function of applied voltage/current,
