good approximations for the collective hydrodynamic description of gases,
liquids and granular media. In the present study, the compressible
hydrodynamics and shock dynamics are studied for a two-dimensional hard-disk
medium at both the continuum and discrete particle level descriptions. For the
continuum description, closed form analytical expressions for the inviscid
hydrodynamic description, shock Hugoniot, isentropic exponent and shock jump
conditions were obtained using the Helfand equation of state. The closed-form
analytical solutions permitted us to gain physical insight on the role of the
material's density on its compressibility, i.e. how the medium compresses under
mechanical loadings and sustains wave motion. Furthermore, the predictions were
found in excellent agreement with calculations using the Event Driven Molecular
Dynamic method involving 30,000 particles over the entire range of
compressibility spanning the dilute ideal gas and liquid phases. In all cases,
it was found that the energy imparted by the piston motion to the thermalized
medium behind the propagating shock was quasi-independent of the medium's
packing fraction, with a correction vanishing with increasing shock Mach
numbers.

function of the filling percentage, is developed. This model is based on
low-temperature electrical resistivity and magneto-resistance (MR)

Efros-Shklovski (E-S) variable range hopping (VRH) to Mott VRH in 3 dimensions
(3D) between the neighboring tubes as the iron weight percentage is increased
from 11% to 19% in the MWNTs. The MR in the hopping regime is strongly
dependent on temperature as well as magnetic field and shows both positive and
negative signs, which are discussed in terms of wave function shrinkage and
quantum interference effects, respectively. A further increase of the iron
percentage from 19% to 31% gives a conductivity crossover from Mott VRH to 3D
weak localization (WL). This change is ascribed to the formation of long iron
nanowires at the core of the nanotubes, which yields a long dephasing length
(e.g. 30 nm) at the lowest measured temperature. Although the overall transport
in this network is described by a 3D WL model, the weak temperature dependence
of inelastic scattering length expressed as L_phi ~T^-0.3 suggests the
possibility for the presence of one-dimensional channels in the network due to
the formation of long Fe nanowires inside the tubes, which might introduce an
alignment in the random structure.

with quadratic nonlinearities. We develop a general multiscale theory for such
systems and apply it to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation as a case study. We
first focus on a regime close to the instability onset (primary bifurcation),
where the system can be described by a single dominant mode. We show
analytically that the resulting noise in the equation describing the amplitude
of the dominant mode largely depends on the nature of the stochastic forcing.
For a highly degenerate noise, in the sense that it is acting on the first
stable mode only, the amplitude equation is dominated by a pure multiplicative
noise, which in turn induces the dominant mode to undergo several critical
state transitions and complex phenomena, including intermittency and
stabilisation, as the noise strength is increased. The intermittent behaviour
is characterised by a power-law probability density and the corresponding
critical exponent is calculated rigorously by making use of the first-passage
properties of the amplitude equation. On the other hand, when the noise is
acting on the whole subspace of stable modes, the multiplicative noise is
corrected by an additive-like term, with the eventual loss of any stabilised
state. We also show that the stochastic forcing has no effect on the dominant
mode dynamics when it is acting on the second stable mode. Finally, in a regime
which is relatively far from the instability onset, so that there are two
unstable modes, we observe numerically that when the noise is acting on the
first stable mode, both dominant modes show noise-induced complex phenomena
similar to the single-mode case.

but rather originates from the non-trivial algebraic properties of the

spin-1/2 lattice to a class of exactly contractible states on spin-S degrees of
freedom, yielding the most efficient tensor network description of finite
Abelian lattice gauge theories. We gain a new perspective on these states as
examples of two-dimensional quantum states with algebraically contractible
tensor network representations. The introduction of local perturbations to the
network is shown to reduce the von Neumann entropy of string-like regions,
creating an unentangled sub-system within the bulk in a certain limit. We also
show how perturbations induce finite-range correlations in this system. This
class of tensor networks is readily translated onto any lattice, and we
differentiate between the physical consequences of bipartite and non-bipartite
lattices on the properties of the corresponding quantum states. We explicitly
show this on the hexagonal, square, kagome and triangular lattices.

improves upon the original minwise hashing in practice by storing only the
lowest b bits of each hashed value, as opposed to using 64 bits. b-bit hashing
is particularly effective in applications which mainly concern sets of high
similarities (e.g., the resemblance >0.5). However, there are other important
applications in which not just pairs of high similarities matter. For example,
many learning algorithms require all pairwise similarities and it is expected
that only a small fraction of the pairs are similar. Furthermore, many
applications care more about containment (e.g., how much one object is
contained by another object) than the resemblance. In this paper, we show that
the estimators for minwise hashing and b-bit minwise hashing used in the
current practice can be systematically improved and the improvements are most

Cosmological N-body simulations has demonstrated that galactic dark matter
haloes have a cuspy density profile at the centre. However, baryonic physics
may affect the dark matter density profile. For example, it was suggested that
adiabatic contraction of baryonic gas makes the dark matter cusp steeper.
However, it is still an open question if the gas falls into the galactic centre
in smooth adiabatic manner. Recent numerical studies suggested that disc
galaxies might experience clumpy phase in their early stage of the disc
formation, which could also explain clump clusters and chain galaxies observed
in high redshift Universe. In this letter, using numerical simulations with an
isolated model, we study how the dark matter halo responds to these clumpy
nature of baryon component in disc galaxy formation through the clump cluster
phase. Our simulation demonstrates that such clumpy phase leads to a shallower
density profile of the dark matter halo in the central region while clumps fall
into the centre due to dynamical friction. This mechanism helps to make the
central dark matter density profile shallower in the galaxies whose virial mass
is as large as 5.0*10^11 solar masses. This phenomenon is caused by reaction to
dynamical friction of the stellar clumps against the dark matter halo. The halo
draws the clumps into the galactic centre, while kinematically heated by the
clumps. We additionally run a dark matter only simulation excluding baryonic
component and confirm that the resultant shallower density profile is not due
to numerical artifact in the simulation, such as two-body relaxation.

group (PRL 2009), we investigate the consequences of leaving the scope of the
approximations originally made, such as the Lamb--Dicke approximation. We
explain the consequential deviations from the idealized QW for different
experimental realizations and an increasing number of steps by taking into
account higher-order terms of the quantum evolution. It turns out that these
become dominant after a few steps already, which is confirmed by experimental
results and is currently limiting the scalability of this approach. Finally, we
propose a new scheme using short laser pulses, derived from a protocol from the
field of quantum computation. We show that the new scheme is not subject to the
above-mentioned restrictions, and analytically and numerically evaluate its
limitations, based on a realistic implementation with our specific setup.
Implementing the protocol with state-of-the-art techniques should allow for
substantially increasing the number of steps to 100 and beyond and should be
extendable to higher-dimensional QWs.

rubber substrate in an external field with and without a noise. In the absence
of the noise, the ball does not move below a threshold force above which it
accelerates sub-linearly with the applied field. In the presence of a random
noise, the ball exhibits a stochastic rolling with a net drift, the velocity of
which increases non-linearly with the strength of the noise (K). From the
evolution of the displacement distribution, it is evident that the rolling is
controlled by a Coulomb like friction at a very low velocity, a super-linear
friction at an intermediate velocity and a linear kinematic friction at a large
velocity. This transition from a non-linear to a linear friction control of
motion can be discerned from another experiment in which the ball is subjected
to a small amplitude periodic asymmetric vibration in conjunction with a random
noise. Here, as opposed to that of a fixed external force, the rolling velocity
decreases with the increase of the strength of the noise suggesting a
progressive fluidization of the interface. Furthermore, the ball exhibits a
flow reversal with the increase of the amplitude of the asymmetric vibration,
which is indicative of a profile of friction that first descends and then
ascends with velocity. An approximate non-linear friction model with the
non-linearity decreasing with K is somewhat consistent with the evolution of
the displacement fluctuation that also explains the sigmoidal variation of the
drift velocity with the strength of the noise. This research sets the stage for
studying friction in a new way, in which it is submitted to a noise and then
its dynamic response is studied using the tools of statistical mechanics.

normality (LAN) of a corresponding point process of exceedances above a high
multivariate threshold, yielding in particular asymptotic efficient estimators.

in the context of functional extreme value theory (EVT). This more general
framework allows estimation over some spatial parameter space, i.e., the finite

magnetic dominated relativistic jet. The much slower acceleration of a magnetic
jet with radius (compared with a hot baryonic outflow) results in high energy
gamma-ray photons to be converted to electron-positron pairs out to a larger
radius whereas lower energy gamma-rays of energy less than ~10 MeV can escape
when the jet crosses the Thomson-photosphere. The resulting delay for the
arrival of high energy photons is found to be similar to the value observed by
the Fermi satellite for a number of GRBs. A prediction of this model is that
the delay should increase with photon energy (E) as E^{0.17} for E>100 MeV. The
delay depends almost linearly on burst redshift, and on the distance from the
central compact object where the jet is launched (R_0). Therefore, the delay in
arrival of >10^2 MeV photons can be used to estimate burst redshift if the
magnetic jet model for gamma-ray generation is correct and R_0 is roughly the
same for long-GRBs.

different dark energy models. We find that the distortion of the distribution

a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formation
rate (SFR)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such a
sequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. Such starburst
galaxies are rare but have much higher SFRs, and it is of interest to establish
the relative importance of these two modes. PACS/Herschel observations over the
whole COSMOS and GOODS-South fields, in conjunction with previous
optical/near-IR data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first time
the relative contribution of the two modes to the global SFR density in the
redshift interval 1.5<z<2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formation
activity. The logarithmic distributions of galaxy SFRs at fixed stellar mass
are well described by Gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only a
relatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for SFRs more than 4 times
higher than on the main sequence. Such starburst galaxies represent only 2% of
mass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic SFR
density at z~2. Only when limited to SFR>1000M(sun)/yr, off-sequence sources
significantly contribute to the SFR density (46+/-20%). We conclude that
merger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation of
stars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards the
quenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

generation of giant radio halos by comparing the level of turbulent kinetic
energy in simulated clusters with the observed properties of radio halo
clusters, giving particular attention to the association of radio halos to
clusters with disturbedX-ray structures. The evolution of X-ray cluster
structure and turbulence kinetic energy, k, in simulations can then inform us
about the expected lifetime of radio halos and the fraction of clusters as a
function of redshift expected to host them. We find strong statistical
correlation of disturbed structure measures and the presence of enhancements in
k. Specifically, quantitatively ""disturbed"", radio halo-like X-ray morphology
in our sample indicates a 92% chance of the cluster in question having k
elevated to more than twice its minimum value over the cluster's life. The
typical lifetime of episodes of elevated turbulence is on the order of 1 Gyr,
though these periods can last 5 Gyrs or more. This variation reflects the wide
range of cluster histories; while some clusters undergo complex and repeated
mergers spending a majority of their time in elevated k states, other clusters
are relaxed over nearly their entire history. We do not find a bimodal
relationship between cluster X-ray luminosity and the total energy in
turbulence that might account directly for a bimodal L_X-P_{1.4 GHz} relation.
However, our result may be consistent with the observed bimodality, as here we

stellar mass and at a given redshift. Assuming that present-day star-forming
galaxies were always star-forming in the past, these growth rate observations
can be integrated to calculate average star formation histories (SFHs). Using
this Main Sequence Integration (MSI) approach, we trace present-day massive
star-forming galaxies back to when they were 10-20% of their current stellar
mass. The integration is robust throughout those epochs: the SFR data
underpinning our calculations is consistent with the evolution of stellar mass
density in this regime. Analytic approximations to these SFHs are provided.
Integration-based results reaffirm previous suggestions that current
star-forming galaxies formed virtually all of their stellar mass at z<2. It
follows that massive galaxies observed at z>2 are not the typical progenitors
of star-forming galaxies today.
  We also check MSI-based SFHs against those inferred from analysis of the
fossil record -- from spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and color magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
of resolved stars in dwarf irregular galaxies. Once stellar population age
uncertainties are accounted for, the main sequence is in excellent agreement
with SED-based SFHs (from VESPA). Extrapolating SFR main sequence observations
to dwarf galaxies, we find differences between MSI results and SFHs from CMD
analysis of ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury and Local Group galaxies.
Resolved dwarfs appear to grow much slower than main sequence trends imply, and
also slower than slightly higher mass SED-analyzed galaxies. This difference
may signal problems with SFH determinations, but it may also signal a shift in
star formation trends at the lowest stellar masses.

phase, and quantum criticality are still a matter of great debate1. In
electron-doped cuprates, the absence of an anomalous pseudogap phase in the

suggest that Mott physics and other unidentified competing orders are less
relevant and that antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations are the dominant
feature. Here we demonstrate that a linear-temperature (T-linear) scattering
rate - a key feature of the anomalous normal state properties of the cuprates -
is correlated with the Cooper pairing (SC). Through a study of magnetotransport
in thin films of the electron-doped cuprate La2 xCexCuO4 (LCCO), we show that
an envelope of T-linear scattering surrounds the SC phase, and survives to zero
temperature when superconductivity is suppressed by magnetic fields. Comparison
with similar behavior found in organic superconductors5 strongly suggests that
the T-linear resistivity is caused by spin-fluctuation scattering. Our results
establish a fundamental connection between AFM spin fluctuations and the

Ejections (ICMEs), forming large scale magnetic flux ropes. In this work we
analyze the evolution of a particular MC (observed on March 1998) using {\it in
situ} observations made by two spacecraft approximately aligned with the Sun,
the first one at 1 AU from the Sun and the second one at 5.4 AU. We study the
MC expansion, its consequent decrease of magnetic field intensity and mass
density, and the possible evolution of the so-called global ideal-MHD
nvariants. We describe the magnetic configuration of the MC at both spacecraft
using different models and compute relevant global quantities (magnetic fluxes,
helicity and energy) at both helio-distances. We also track back this structure
to the Sun, in order to find out its solar source. We find that the flux rope
is significantly distorted at 5.4 AU. However, we are able to analyze the data
before the flux rope center is over-passed and compare it with observations at
1 AU. From the observed decay of magnetic field and mass density, we quantify
how anisotropic is the expansion, and the consequent deformation of the flux
rope in favor of a cross section with an aspect ratio at 5.4 AU of $\approx
1.6$ (larger in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction from the
Sun). We quantify the ideal-MHD invariants and magnetic energy at both
locations, and find that invariants are almost conserved, while the magnetic
energy decays as expected with the expansion rate found. The use of MHD
invariants to link structures at the Sun and the interplanetary medium is
supported by the results of this multispacecraft study. We also conclude that
the local dimensionless expansion rate, that is computed from the velocity
profile observed by a single spacecraft, is very accurate for predicting the
evolution of flux ropes in the solar wind.

vanish with $p$-refinement for anisotropic diffusion. We shall illustrate the
performance of $p$-refinement using several representative problems. The
intended outcome of the paper is twofold. Firstly, this study will caution the
users of high-order approximations about its performance with respect to

contribute toward addressing this issue. The second goal is to elucidate the
role played by chaotic wave dynamics in the propagation of information and the
resulting impact on forecasts. To accomplish these goals, the principal tool
used here will be analysis and interpretation of numerical experiments on a toy
atmospheric model introduced by Lorenz in 2005. Propagation of the wave packets
of this model is shown. It is found that, when an ensemble Kalman filter scheme
is employed, the spatial correlation function obtained at each forecast cycle
by averaging over the background ensemble members is short ranged, and this is
in strong contrast to the much longer range correlation function obtained by
averaging over states from free evolution of the model. Propagation of the
effects of observations made in one region on forecasts in other regions is
studied. The error covariance matrices from the analyses with localization and
without localization are compared. From this study, major characteristics of
the localization process and information propagation are extracted and
summarized.

the same combination of constants obtained from the comparison fine structure
line of singly ionised carbon, [CII]. However, neutral carbon has the distinct
advantage that it may be spatially coincident with the carbon monoxide, whereas
[CII] could be located in the diffuse medium between molecular clouds, and so
any comparison with CO could be dominated by intrinsic velocity differences.
Using [CI], we obtain a mean variation of dF/F = (-3.6 +/- 8.5) x 10^-5, over z
= 2.3 - 4.1, for the eight [CI] systems, which degrades to (-1.5+/- 11) x
10^-5, over z = 2.3 - 6.4 when the two [CII] systems are included. That is,
zero variation over look-back times of 10.8-12.8 Gyr. However, the latest
optical results indicate a spatial variation in alpha, which describes a dipole
and we see the same direction in dF/F. This trend is, however, due to a single
source for which the [CI] spectrum is of poor quality. This also applies to one
of the two [CII] spectra previously used to find a zero variation in
alpha^2/mu. Quantifying this, we find an anti-correlation between |dF/F| and
the quality of the carbon detection, as measured by the spectral resolution,
indicating that the typical values of >50 km/s, used to obtain a detection, are
too coarse to reliably measure changes in the constants. From the fluxes of the
known z > 1 CO systems, we predict that current instruments are incapable of
the sensitivities required to measure changes in the constants through the
comparison of CO and carbon lines. We therefore discuss in detail the use of

to the conduction band as the temperature increases. By measuring the
resistivity $\rho(T)$ of a given single crystal after repeated thermal cycling
in vacuum, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies play an important role in
governing the shallow donor concentrations but leave the activation energy
($\simeq27\pm$2 meV) largely intact. In the case of polycrystalline films, two
types of thermal activation conduction processes are also observed between
$\sim$150 and 500 K. Below $\sim$150 K, we found an additional conduction
process due to the nearest-neighbor-hopping conduction mechanism which takes
place in the shallow impurity band. As the temperatures further decreases below
$\sim$80 K, a crossover to the Mott variable-range-hopping conduction process
is observed. Taken together with our previous measurements on $\rho (T)$ of ZnO
polycrystalline films in the temperature range 2--100 K [Y. L. Huang {\it et
al.}, J. Appl. Phys. \textbf{107}, 063715 (2010)], this work establishes a
quite complete picture of the overall electrical conduction mechanisms in the
ZnO material from liquid-helium temperatures up to 500 K.

  Downlinks: Tractable Approximations by Conic Optimization",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a probabilistic signal-to-interference and-noise
ratio (SINR) constrained problem for transmit beamforming design in the
presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI), under a multiuser
multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink scenario. In particular, we deal
with outage-based quality-of-service constraints, where the probability of each
user's SINR not satisfying a service requirement must not fall below a given
outage probability specification. The study of solution approaches to the
probabilistic SINR constrained problem is important because CSI errors are
often present in practical systems and they may cause substantial SINR outages
if not handled properly. However, a major technical challenge is how to process
the probabilistic SINR constraints. To tackle this, we propose a novel
relaxation- restriction (RAR) approach, which consists of two key
ingredients-semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and analytic tools for
conservatively approximating probabilistic constraints. The underlying goal is
to establish approximate probabilistic SINR constrained formulations in the
form of convex conic optimization problems, so that they can be readily
implemented by available solvers. Using either an intuitive worst-case argument
or specialized probabilistic results, we develop various conservative
approximation schemes for processing probabilistic constraints with quadratic
uncertainties. Consequently, we obtain several RAR alternatives for handling
the probabilistic SINR constrained problem. Our techniques apply to both
complex Gaussian CSI errors and i.i.d. bounded CSI errors with unknown
distribution. Moreover, results obtained from our extensive simulations show
that the proposed RAR methods significantly improve upon existing ones, both in
terms of solution quality and computational complexity.

The proposed scheme minimizes a cost function in which the control variable is
the joint state of the global and the limited area models. In addition, the
cost function includes a constraint term that penalizes large differences
between the global and the limited area state estimates. The proposed approach
is tested by idealized experiments, using `toy' models introduced by Lorenz in
2005. The results of these experiments suggest that the proposed approach
improves the global analysis within and near the limited area domain and the
regional analysis near the lateral boundaries. These analysis improvements lead
to forecast improvements in both the global and the limited area models.

We develop a framework for analysis of these corrections, that is complementary
to the conventional spin-chain approach, by making use of the hole rather than
the magnon picture. From the dual string theory perspective where the
large-spin operator is identified with the Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov (GKP)
string, our approach is equivalent to constructing the first Luescher
correction to the energy of the GKP string by incorporating the contribution of
virtual excitations propagating on it. It allows us to propose a formula that
controls a particular class of large-spin corrections to the twist-two
anomalous dimension and holds at any value of the coupling constant. Compared
to wrapping corrections computed with magnons propagating on the spin chain,
the finite-size corrections that are encoded in our formalism start at a lower
loop level. Our formalism thus calls for modification of the asymptotic
contributions which are conventionally incorporated within the Asymptotic Bethe
Ansatz. An educated guess allows us to remedy this pitfall and successfully
confront our predictions with known results up to five loop accuracy at weak
coupling. Finally, our formula sheds light on the weak-to-strong coupling
transition for the subleading large-spin corrections under study and confirms
stringy expectations at strong coupling where they are found to be identical to
the first Luescher correction to the vacuum energy of the O(6) sigma model.

catalogues are used to test the reliability of our method against uncertainties
arising from redshift distortions, survey boundaries, and false identifications
of groups by our group finder. We find that both the velocity and tidal fields,
smoothed on a scale of ~2Mpc/h, can be reliably reconstructed in the inner
region (~66%) of the survey volume. The reconstructed tidal field is used to
split the cosmic web into clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids, depending on
the sign of the eigenvalues of tidal tensor. The reconstructed velocity field
nicely shows how the flows are diverging from the centers of voids, and
converging onto clusters, while sheets and filaments have flows that are
convergent along one and two directions, respectively. We use the reconstructed
velocity field and the Zel'dovich approximation to predict the mass density
field in the SDSS volume as function of redshift, and find that the mass
distribution closely follows the galaxy distribution even on small scales. We
find a large-scale bulk flow of about 117km/s in a very large volume,
equivalent to a sphere with a radius of ~170Mpc/h, which seems to be produced
by the massive structures associated with the SDSS Great Wall. Finally, we
discuss potential applications of our reconstruction to study the environmental
effects of galaxy formation, to generate initial conditions for simulations of
the local Universe, and to constrain cosmological models. The velocity, tidal

to distinction between normal (transverse) and virtual (longitudinal) photons.
Formulas are derived for dipole and non-dipole angular anisotropy parameters in
fast electronatom scattering. The ratio of quadrupole-to-dipole matrix elements
is determined by the parameter \omega R/v << 1 where \omega is the transferred
in collision energy, R is the ionized shell radius and v is the speed of
projectile. This factor can be much bigger than in the case of photoionization,
where one has the speed of light c that is much bigger than v . We illustrate
general formulas by concrete results for outer s-subshells of noble gas atoms

distribution. Methods. We estimate the extinction and accretion luminosity
towards each source by performing synthetic photometry on an empirical
calibration of atmospheric models (Da Rio et al. 2010) using the package
Chorizos (Maiz-Apellaniz 2004). The position of the sources in the HR-diagram
is compared with different theoretical isochrones to estimate the mean cluster
age and age dispersion. Through Monte Carlo simulations we quantify the amount
of intrinsic age spread in the region, taking into account uncertainties on the
distance, spectral type, extinction, unresolved binaries, accretion and
photometric variability. Results. According to Siess et al. (2000) evolutionary
models the mean age of the Cluster is 2.2 Myr with a scatter of few Myrs. With
Monte Carlo simulations we find that the observed age spread is inconsistent
with a coeval stellar population, but is in agreement with a star formation
activity between 1.5 and 3.5 Myrs. We also observe light evidence for a trend

One argument is
that the BL Lac objects show bluer-when-brighter chromatism while the

a 3.5-year three-colour monitoring programme, we studied the optical
variability and colour behaviour of one FSRQ, 3C 345. There is at least one
outburst in this period. The overall variation amplitude is 2.640 mags in the
$i$ band. Intra-night variability was observed on two nights. The
bluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter chromatisms were simultaneously
observed in this object when using different pairs of passbands to compute the
colours. The bluer-when-brighter chromatism is a shared property with the BL
Lacs, while the redder-when-brighter trend is likely due to two less variable
emission features, the Mg\,{\sc ii} line and the blue bump, at short
wavelengths. With numerical simulations, we show that some other strong but
less variable emission lines in the spectrum of FSRQs may also significantly
alter their colour behaviour. Then the colour behaviour of an FSRQ is linked
not only to the emission process in the relativistic jet, but also to the
redshift, the passbands used for computing the colour and the strengths of the
less variable emission features relative to the strength of the non-thermal
continuum.

propagate. A streamer can supply these electrons by itself through
photo-ionization, or the electrons can be present due to external background
ionization. Here we investigate the effects of background ionization on
streamer propagation and morphology by changing the gas composition and the
repetition rate of the voltage pulses, and by adding a small amount of
radioactive Krypton 85.
  We find that the general morphology of a positive streamer discharge in high
purity nitrogen depends on background ionization: at lower background
ionization levels the streamers branch more and have a more feather-like
appearance. This is observed both when varying the repetition rate and when
adding Krypton 85, though side branches are longer with the radioactive
admixture. But velocities and minimal diameters of streamers are virtually
independent of the background ionization level. In air, the inception cloud
breaks up into streamers at a smaller radius when the repetition rate and
therefore the background ionization level is higher. When measuring the effects
of the pulse repetition rate and of the radioactive admixture on the discharge
morphology, we found that our estimates of background ionization levels are
consistent with these observations; this gives confidence in the estimates.
  Streamer channels generally do not follow the paths of previous discharge
channels for repetition rates of up to 10 Hz. We estimate the effect of
recombination and diffusion of ions and free electrons from the previous
discharge and conclude that the old trail has largely disappeared at the moment
of the next voltage pulse; therefore the next streamers indeed cannot follow
the old trail.

classifies TB into two categories, Pulmonary Tuberculosis(PTB) and retroviral
PTB(RPTB) that is those with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.
Initially K-means clustering is used to group the TB data into two clusters and
assigns classes to clusters. Subsequently multiple different classification
algorithms are trained on the result set to build the final classifier model
based on K-fold cross validation method. This methodology is evaluated using
700 raw TB data obtained from a city hospital. The best obtained accuracy was
98.7% from support vector machine (SVM) compared to other classifiers. The
proposed approach helps doctors in their diagnosis decisions and also in their
treatment planning procedures for different categories.

constituted by at least three components which contribute to the line profiles.
Component I is the redmost one, and is 20 km/s and 78 km/s redward component II
and III, respectively. We detect several ground state and excited absorption
features in components I and II. These features have been used to compute the
distances between the GRB and the absorbers. Component I is found to be 52 +/-6
pc away from the GRB, while component II presents few excited transitions and
its distance is 200+60-80 pc. Component III only features a few, low ionization
and saturated lines suggesting that it is even farther from the GRB. The
hydrogen column density associated to GRB 081008 is log N_H/cm^-2 = 21.11 +/-
0.10, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [X/H] = -1.29 to
-0.52. In particular, we found [Fe/H]=-1.19 +/- 0.11 and [Zn/H]=-0.52+/- 0.11

of dust in the GRB ISM, given the opposite refractory properties of iron and
zinc. By deriving the depletion pattern for GRB 081008, we find the optical
extinction in the visual band to be A_V ~0.19 mag. The Curve of Growth analysis

is shown that the Plasmon-X scheme used for the electron acceleration uses a
sufficiently broad beam ($L_\bot\sim 130\,\,\mu{\rm m}$) that justifies the use
of the standard stationary 1-D approximation in the electron hydrodynamic
equations, since the pulse width is sufficiently bigger than the pulse length
($\sim 7.5\,\,\mu{\rm m}$). Furthermore, with the laser power of $W\leq 250$ TW
and the $130\,\,\mu{\rm m}$ spot size, the dimensionless laser vector potential
is sufficiently small $|A_{\bot_0}|^2/{2} =
({W}/{c^2\epsilon_0})({\lambda^2}/{8 \pi^2 c})({4}/{\pi L_\bot^2})({e}/{m_0
c})^2 \sim 0.26$, the nonlinearity is sufficiently weak to allow the power
expansion in the nonlinear Poissons's equation. Such approximation yields a
nonlinear Schr\"" odinger equation with a reactive nonlocal nonlinear term. The
nonlocality contains a cosine function under the integral, indicating the
oscillating wake. For a smaller spot size that is used for the Thomson
scattering, $L_\bot = 10\,\, \mu$m, the length and the width of the pulse are
comparable, and it is not possible to use the 1-D approximation in the
hydrodynamic equations. With such small spot size, the laser intensity is very
large, and most likely some sort of chanelling in the plasma would take place
(the plasma gets locally depleted so much that the electromagnetic wave
practically propagates in vacuum).

ratio. Proposed explanations for this darkness are: i) the GRB is at high
redshift ii) dust in the GRB host galaxy absorbs the optical/NIR flux iii) GRBs
have an intrinsically faint afterglow emission. Within this framework, GRB
100614A and GRB 100615A are extreme. In fact, they are bright in the X-rays,
but no optical/NIR afterglow has been detected for either source, despite
several follow-up campaigns began early after the triggers. We build
optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the times at which the
reddest upper limits are available, and we model our SEDs with the extinction
curves of the Milky Way (MW), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the attenuation
curve obtained for a sample of starburst galaxies. We find that to explain the
deepest NIR upper limits assuming either a MW or SMC extinction law, a visual
extinction of AV > 50 is required, which is extremely unlikely. Since both GRBs
are bright in X-rays, explanation iii) also cannot explain their dark
classification, unless optical radiation and X-rays are not part of the same
synchrotron spectrum. An alternative, or complementary explanation of the
previous possibility, involves greyer extinction laws. A starburst attenuation
curve gives AV>10, which is less extreme, despite still very high. Assuming
high redshift in addition to extinction, implies an AV>10 at z=2 and AV>4-5 at
z=5, regardless of the adopted extinction recipe. A different, exotic
possibility would be an extremely high redshift origin (z>17 given the missing
K detections). Population III stars are expected to emerge at z ~ 20 and can
produce GRBs with energies well above those inferred for our GRBs at these
redshifts. Mid- and far-IR observations of these extreme class of GRBs can help
us to differentiate between the proposed scenarios.

evolutionary models, especially at high redshifts. However, at z~2 the limited
signal to noise ratio and spatial resolution of the data usually do not allow
spatially resolved kinematical modeling and very often only virial masses can
be estimated from line widths. But even such estimates require a good knowledge
of galaxy size, which may be smaller than the spatial resolution.
Spectroastrometry is a technique which combines spatial and spectral resolution
to probe spatial scales significantly smaller than the spatial resolution of
the observations. Here we apply it to the case of high-z galaxies and present a
method based on spectroastrometry to estimate dynamical masses of high z
galaxies, which overcomes the problem of size determination with poor spatial
resolution. We construct and calibrate a ""spectroastrometric"" virial mass
estimator, modifying the ""classical"" virial mass formula. We apply our method
to the [O III] or H{\alpha} emission line detected in z~2-3 galaxies from
AMAZE, LSD and SINS samples and we compare the spectroastrometric estimator
with dynamical mass values resulting from full spatially resolved kinematical
modeling. The spectroastrometric estimator is found to be a good approximation
of dynamical masses, presenting a linear relation with a residual dispersion of
only 0.15 dex. This is a big improvement compared to the ""classical"" virial
mass estimator which has a non linear relation and much larger dispersion (0.47
dex) compared to dynamical masses. By applying our calibrated estimator to 16
galaxies from the AMAZE and LSD samples, we obtain masses in the ~10^7-10^10
M\odot range extending the mass range attainable with dynamical modeling.

prominent to that of the SM values for these observables. For instance, in SUSY
I and SUSY II, the forward-backward asymmetry does not cross zero which is
mainly due to the same sign of the $C_{7}^{eff}$ and $C_{9}^{eff}$ Wilson

the new Wilson coefficients -- corresponding to the new operators arising due
to the contribution of neutral Higgs bosons (NHBs) -- the above mentioned

also to infer new generators without the need of explicitly finding an
automorphism of the graph. This result is especially suited for graphs with
regularly connected components, and can be applied in any isomorphism testing

target cell selection function is used to adapt to different graphs. The
resulting algorithm preserves all the nice features of conauto, but reduces the

globally coupled to a common environmental source of information. The
environmental stimuli were given in a form of referee's decisions list. The
sample of fans had to respond on each stimulus by associating points signifying
his/her own opinion, emotion and action that referee's decisions provoke. Data
were fitted by the Brillouin function which was a solution of an adapted model
of quantum statistical physics to social phenomena. Correlation and a principal
component analysis were performed in order to detect any collective behavior of
the social ensemble of fans. Results showed that fans behaved as a system
subject to a phase transition where the neutral state in the opinion, emotional
and action space has been destabilized and a new stable state of coherent
attitudes was formed. The enhancement of fluctuations and the increase of
social susceptibility (responsiveness) to referee's decisions were connected to
the first few decisions. The subsequent reduction of values in these parameters
signified the onset of coherent layering within the attitude space of the
social ensemble of fans. In the space of opinions fan coherence was maximal as
only one layer of coherence emerged. In the emotional and action spaces the
number of coherent levels was 2 and 4 respectively. The principal component
analysis revealed a strong collective behavior and a high degree of integration
within and between the opinion, emotional and action spaces of the sample of
fans. These results point to one possible way of how different proto-groups,
violent and moderate, may be formed as a consequence of global coupling to a
common source of information.

to have identical state trajectories, appart from an error converging to zero.
This method consists in an appropriate unidirectional coupling from one system
(drive) to the other (response). This requires that the response system shares
the same dynamical model with the drive. For the cases where the drive is
unknown, Chen proposed in 2002 a method to adapt the response system such that
synchronization is achieved, provided that (1) the response dynamical model is
linear with a vector of parameters, and (2) there is a parameter vector that
makes both system dynamics identical. However, this method has two limitations:
first, it does not scale well for complex parametric models (e.g., if the
number of parameters is greater than the state dimension), and second, the
model parameters are not guaranteed to converge, namely as the synchronization
error approaches zero. This paper presents an adaptation law addressing these
two limitations. Stability and convergence proofs, using Lyapunov's second
method, support the proposed adaptation law. Finally, numerical simulations
illustrate the advantages of the proposed method, namely showing cases where
the Chen's method fail, while the proposed one does not.

Data domain. Given the large-scale of the complex networks researchers commonly
deal with nowadays, the use of localized information (i.e. restricted to a
limited neighborhood around each node of the network) for centrality-based
analysis is gaining momentum in the recent literature. In this context, we
propose a framework for the Distributed Assessment of Network Centralities

use of different localized centrality proposals, which can be tailored to
specific applications. This environment can be thus useful given the vast
potential applicability of centrality-based analysis on large-scale complex
networks found in different areas, such as Biology, Physics, Sociology, or
Computer Science. Since the localized centrality proposals DANCE implements
employ only localized information, DANCE can easily benefit from parallel
processing environments and run on different computing architectures. To
illustrate this, we present a parallel implementation of DANCE and show how it
can be applied to the analysis of large-scale complex networks using different
kinds of network centralities. This implementation is made available to complex
network researchers and practitioners interested in using it through a

distributions of neutrino events. Based on the correlation between L_nu and
L_mu (Figures~16 to 18 in Part1) and the correlation between E_nu and E_mu
(Figure19 in Part1), we have made four possible L/E analyses, namely L_nu/E_nu,
L_nu/E_mu, L_mu/E_mu and L_mu/E_nu. Among four kinds of L/E analyses, we have
shown that only L_nu/E_nu analysis can give the signature of maximum
oscillations clearly, not only the first maximum oscillation but also the
second and third maximum oscillation and etc., as they should be, while the
L_mu/E_mu analysis which are really done by Super-Kamiokande Collaboration
cannot give any maximum oscillation at all. It is thus concluded from those
results that the experiments with the use of the cosmic-ray beam for neutrino
oscillation, such as Super-Kamiokande type experiment, are unable to lead the
maximum oscillation from their L/E analysis, because the incident neutrino
cannot be observed due to its neutrality. Therefore, we would suggest
Super-Kamiokande Collaboration to re-analyze the zenith angle distribution of
the neutrino events which occur inside the detector carefully, since L_nu and
L_mu are alternative expressions of the cosine of the zenith angle for the
incident neutrino and that for the emitted muon, respectively.

redshift ii) dust in the GRB host galaxy absorbs the optical/NIR flux iii) GRBs
have an intrinsically faint afterglow emission. Within this framework, GRB
100614A and GRB 100615A are extreme. In fact, they are bright in the X-rays,
but no optical/NIR afterglow has been detected for either source, despite
several follow-up campaigns began early after the triggers. We build
optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the times at which the
reddest upper limits are available, and we model our SEDs with the extinction
curves of the Milky Way (MW), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the attenuation
curve obtained for a sample of starburst galaxies. We find that to explain the
deepest NIR upper limits assuming either a MW or SMC extinction law, a visual
extinction of AV > 50 is required, which is extremely unlikely. Since both GRBs
are bright in X-rays, explanation iii) also cannot explain their dark
classification, unless optical radiation and X-rays are not part of the same
synchrotron spectrum. An alternative, or complementary explanation of the
previous possibility, involves greyer extinction laws. A starburst attenuation
curve gives AV>10, which is less extreme, despite still very high. Assuming
high redshift in addition to extinction, implies an AV>10 at z=2 and AV>4-5 at
z=5, regardless of the adopted extinction recipe. A different, exotic
possibility would be an extremely high redshift origin (z>17 given the missing
K detections). Population III stars are expected to emerge at z ~ 20 and can
produce GRBs with energies well above those inferred for our GRBs at these
redshifts. Mid- and far-IR observations of these extreme class of GRBs can help
us to differentiate between the proposed scenarios.

magnetic carpet. It is the first in a series of papers working towards
constructing a realistic 3D non-potential model for the interaction of
small-scale solar magnetic fields. In the model, the basic evolution of the
magnetic elements is governed by a supergranular flow profile. In addition,
magnetic elements may evolve through the processes of emergence, cancellation,
coalescence and fragmentation. Model parameters for the emergence of bipoles
are based upon the results of observational studies. Using this model, several
simulations are considered, where the range of flux with which bipoles may
emerge is varied. In all cases the model quickly reaches a steady state where
the rates of emergence and cancellation balance. Analysis of the resulting
magnetic field shows that we reproduce observed quantities such as the flux
distribution, mean field, cancellation rates, photospheric recycle time and a
magnetic network. As expected, the simulation matches observations more closely
when a larger, and consequently more realistic, range of emerging flux values
is allowed (4e16 - 1e19 Mx). The model best reproduces the current observed
properties of the magnetic carpet when we take the minimum absolute flux for
emerging bipoles to be 4e16 Mx. In future, this 2D model will be used as an
evolving photospheric boundary condition for 3D non-potential modeling.

of its optical afterglow. UVES high resolution spectroscopy of GRB 081008 was
secured ~5 hr after the Swift trigger. Our dataset comprises also three FORS2
nearly simultaneous spectra of the same source. The availability of nearly
simultaneous high and low resolution spectra for a GRB afterglow is an
extremely rare event. The GRB-Damped Lyman Alpha system at z = 1.9683 shows
that the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy is constituted by at
least three components which contribute to the line profiles. Component I is
the redmost one, and is 20 km/s and 78 km/s redward component II and III,
respectively. We detect several ground state and excited absorption features in
components I and II. These features have been used to compute the distances
between the GRB and the absorbers. Component I is found to be 52 +/- 6 pc away
from the GRB, while component II presents few excited transitions and its
distance is 200+60-80} pc. The hydrogen column density associated to GRB 081008
is log NH/cm^-2 = 21.11 +/- 0.10, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in
the range [X/H] = -1.29 to -0.52. In particular, we found [Fe/H]=-1.19 +/- 0.11
and [Zn/H]=-0.52 +/- 0.11 with respect to solar values. This discrepancy can be
explained by the presence of dust in the GRB ISM, given the opposite refractory
properties of iron and zinc. By deriving the depletion pattern for GRB 081008,
we find the optical extinction in the visual band to be AV ~ 0.19 mag. The
Curve of Growth analysis applied to the FORS2 spectra brings column densities
consistent at the 3 sigma level to that evaluated from the UVES data using the
line fitting procedure. This reflects the low saturation of the detected
GRB\,081008 absorption features.

beam downstream of the baseline undulator should provide a way of transporting
the radiation up to the experimental floor. Here we propose to use the dump
area access maze. In this way the THz output must propagate with limited size
at least for one hundred meters in a maze, following many turns, to reach the
near experimental hall. The use of a standard, discrete, open beam-waveguide
formed by periodic reflectors, that is a mirror guide, would lead to
unacceptable size of the system. To avoid these problems, in this paper we
propose an alternative approach based on periodically spaced metallic screens
with holes. This quasi-optical transmission line is referred to as an iris
line. We present complete calculations for the iris line using both analytical
and numerical methods, which we find in good agreement. We present a design of
a THz edge radiation source based on the use of an iris line. The proposed
setup takes almost no cost nor time to be implemented at the LCLS baseline, and
can be used at other facilities as well. The edge radiation source is limited
in maximally achievable field strength at the sample. An extension based on the
use of an undulator in the presence of the iris line, which is feasible at the
LCLS energies, is proposed as a possible upgrade of the baseline THz source.

powerful criterion to determine J_2/J_1 using a combination of exact

apply this method to the quasi-2D compound Cu(pz)_2(ClO_4)_2 and show that it

X-ray data from 0.3-40 keV to identify the source as a bright intermediate
polar (IP) with an estimate for the white dwarf mass of~0.60 M_solar. This
identification is supported by the presence of an iron triplet, the component
lines of which are some of the strongest seen in IPs; and the signature of the
spin period of the white dwarf at ~24 mins. We note that the lack of broad-band
variability may suggest that this object is a stream-fed IP, similar in many
respects to the well studied IP, V2400 Oph. Phase-binning has allowed us to
create spectra corresponding to the peaks and troughs of the lightcurve from
which we determine that the spectra appear harder in the troughs, consistent
with the behaviour of other IPs binned on their spin periods. This work
strongly suggests a mis-identification in the optical due to the presence of
large columns of enshrouding material. We instead propose a distance to the
source of <2.5 kpc to be consistent with the luminosities of other IPs in the
dim, hard state. The relatively high flux of the source together with the
strength of the iron lines may, in future, allow the source to be used to
diagnose the properties of the shock heated plasma and the reflected component

blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft X-ray, hard
X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. Our unique data set has allowed us to demonstrate
that the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biases
that cannot be ignored. Almost all the BL Lac objects have been detected by
Fermi-LAT, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in the
radio, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray selected samples are still below the
gamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of Fermi-LAT data.
The radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70GHz, above
which it steepens to <\alpha>~-0.65. BL Lacs have significantly flatter spectra
than FSRQs at higher frequencies. The distribution of the rest-frame
synchrotron peak frequency (\nupS) in the SED of FSRQs is the same in all the
blazar samples with <\nupS>=10^13.1 Hz, while the mean inverse-Compton peak
frequency, <\nupIC>, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 Hz. The distributions of \nupS
and of \nupIC of BL Lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energies
than those of FSRQs and strongly depend on the selection method. The Compton
dominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only FSRQs reaching values
>3. Its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,
with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selected
blazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar power
is dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. Simple SSC models
cannot explain the SEDs of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in all
samples. The SED of the blazars that were not detected by Fermi-LAT may instead
be consistent with SSC emission. Our data challenge the correlation between
bolometric luminosity and \nupS predicted by the blazar sequence.

electronics equipments adopted to compensate for cur-rent harmonic pollution in
electric mains, due to nonlinear loads. By using a proper ""floating"" capacitor
as energy reservoir, the SAF purpose is to inject in the line grid currents
canceling the polluting har-monics. Control algorithms play a key role for such
devices and, in general, in many power electronics applications. Moreover,
systems theory is crucial, since it is the mathematical tool that enables a
deep understanding of the involved dynamics of such systems, allowing a correct
dimensioning, beside an effective control. As a matter of facts, current
injection objective can be straightforwardly formulated as an output tracking
control problem. In this fashion, the structural and insidious
marginally-stable internal/zero dynamics of SAFs can be immediately highlighted
and characterized in terms of sizing and control issues. For what concerns the
control design strictly, time-scale separation among output and internal
dynamics can be effectively exploited to split the control design in different
stages that can be later aggregated, by using singular perturbation analysis.
In addition, for robust asymptotic output tracking the Internal Model Principle
is adopted.

"1108.1124","Nathan Linial","Amir Ban and Nati Linial","Leapfrog in Posets",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the following solitaire game whose rules are reminiscent of the
children's game of leapfrog. The player is handed an arbitrary ordering
$\pi=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ of the elements of a finite poset $(P,\prec)$. At each
round an element may ""skip over"" the element in front of it, i.e. swap
positions with it. For example, if $x_i \prec x_{i+1}$, then it is allowed to
move from $\pi$ to the ordering
$(x_1,x_2,...,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},x_i,x_{i+2},...,x_n)$. The player is to carry out
such steps as long as such swaps are possible. When there are several
consecutive pairs of elements that satisfy this condition, the player can
choose which pair to swap next. Does the order of swaps matter for the final
ordering or is it uniquely determined by the initial ordering? The reader may
guess correctly that the latter proposition is correct. What may be more
surprising, perhaps, is that this question is not trivial. The proof works by
constructing an appropriate system of invariants.

determined for prominent excited proton states with masses below 1.8 GeV in
independent analyses of major meson electroproduction channels: $\pi^{+}n$,
$\pi^0p$ and $\pi^+\pi^-p$. Consistent results on resonance electrocouplings
obtained from analyses of these exclusive reactions with different non-resonant
contributions demonstrate reliable extraction of these fundamental quantities
for states that have significant decays for either $N\pi$ or $N\pi\pi$
channels. Preliminary results on electrocouplings of $N^*$ states with masses
above 1.6 GeV have become available from the CLAS data on $\pi^+\pi^-p$
electroproduction off protons for the first time. Comparison with quark models
and coupled-channel approaches strongly suggest that $N^*$ structure is
determined by contributions from an internal core of three constituent quarks
and an external meson-baryon cloud at the distances covered in these
measurements with the CLAS detector.

has been intensely discussed for the last 40 years in relativistic
hadron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions and confirmed by new data
coming from the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, can lead to energetic
particle production. Created from hadronization of the quark/parton (or
quarks/partons), energetic particles could get the energy of grouped partons
from coherent interactions. Therefore, we think that in the centre of some
massive stars, a medium with high density, close to Quantum Chromodynamic one
could be a source of the super high-energy cosmic rays.

charge density distribution of a quantum system. According to protective
measurement, a charged quantum system has mass and charge density proportional
to the modulus square of its wave function. It is shown that the mass and
charge density is not real but effective, and it is formed by the ergodic
motion of a localized particle with the total mass and charge of the system.
Moreover, it is argued that the ergodic motion is not continuous but
discontinuous and random. This result suggests a new interpretation of the wave
function, according to which the wave function is a description of random
discontinuous motion of particles, and the modulus square of the wave function
gives the probability density of the particles being in certain locations. It
is shown that the suggested interpretation of the wave function disfavors the
de Broglie-Bohm theory and the many-worlds interpretation but favors the
dynamical collapse theories, and the random discontinuous motion of particles
may provide an appropriate random source to collapse the wave function.

from simply connected domains in $\CC$. We indicate a way in which Brownian
motion sees the identity function and the Koebe function as the smallest and
largest analytic functions, respectively, in the Schlicht class. We also give a
sharpening of a result of McConnell's concerning the moments of exit times of
Schlicht domains. We then show how a simple formula for expected exit time can
be applied in a series of examples. Included in the examples given are the
expected exit times from given points of a cardioid and regular $m$-gon, as
well as bounds on the expected exit time of an infinite wedge. We also
calculate the expected exit time of an infinite strip, and in the process
obtain a probabilistic derivation of Euler's result that
$\zeta(2)=\sum_{n=1}^\ff \frac{1}{n^2}= \frac{\pi^2}{6}$. We conclude by
showing how the formula can be applied to some domains which are not simply
connected.
