$\rho(\w)\propto|\w|^r$, of the bath fermions. Combining both analytical and
numerical renormalization group techniques, we characterize the impurity phases
and quantum phase transitions of the relevant Kondo and Anderson models. The
line of stable points, corresponding to the overscreened non-Fermi liquid
behavior of the metallic $r=0$ case, is replaced by a stable particle-hole
symmetric intermediate-coupling fixed point for $0<r<\rmax\approx0.23$. For
$r>\rmax$, this non-Fermi liquid phase disappears, and instead a critical fixed
point with an emergent spin--channel symmetry appears, controlling the quantum
phase transition between two phases with stable spin and channel moments,
respectively. We propose low-energy field theories to describe the quantum
phase transitions, all being formulated in fermionic variables. We employ
epsilon expansion techniques to calculate critical properties near the critical
dimensions $r=0$ and $r=1$, the latter being potentially relevant for
two-channel Kondo impurities in neutral graphene. We find the analytical
results to be in excellent agreement with those obtained from applying Wilson's
numerical renormalization group technique.

enough to simultaneously explain the supernovae observations, the small-angle

result is that the structure group of the direct sum of such canonical
algebraic curvature tensors on a decomposable model space must permute the
subspaces $V_i$ on which they are defined. For such an algebraic curvature
tensor, we show that if the vector space $V$ is a direct sum of subspaces $V_1$

$V_2$ are invariant of the action of the structure group on $V$. We determine
the freedom one has in permuting these subspaces, and show these subspaces are
invariant if $\dim V_1 \neq \dim V_2$ or if the corresponding symmetric forms
defined on those subspaces have different (but not reversed) signatures, so
that in this situation, only the trivial permutation is allowable. We exhibit a
model space that realizes the full permutation group, and, with exception to
the balanced signature case, show the corresponding structure group is
isomorphic to the wreath product of the structure group of a given symmetric
bilinear form by the symmetric group. Using these results, we conclude that the

tradeoff between utility, quantified via fidelity of its state estimate at each

functional MRI (fMRI) matrix into a set of 1-D basis time courses and their
associated 3-D spatial maps that are optimized for mutual independence. When
applied to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI), ICA produces several spatial
independent components (ICs) that seem to have biological relevance - the
so-called resting state networks (RSNs). The ICA problem is well posed when the
true data generating process follows a linear mixture of ICs model in terms of
the identifiability of the mixing matrix. However, the contrast function used
for promoting mutual independence in ICA is dependent on the finite amount of
observed data and is potentially non-convex with multiple local minima. Hence,
each run of ICA could produce potentially different IC estimates even for the
same data. One technique to deal with this run-to-run variability of ICA was
proposed by Yang et al. (2008) in their algorithm RAICAR which allows for the
selection of only those ICs that have a high run-to-run reproducibility. We
propose an enhancement to the original RAICAR algorithm that enables us to
assign reproducibility p-values to each IC and allows for an objective
assessment of both within subject and across subjects reproducibility. We call
the resulting algorithm RAICAR-N (N stands for null hypothesis test), and we
have applied it to publicly available human rsfMRI data (http://www.nitrc.org).
Our reproducibility analyses indicated that many of the published RSNs in

radiation in a reflecting cavity. By calculating the work necessary to keep the
cavity moving at a constant velocity against the radiation pressure he
concluded that to a moving observer the energy of the radiation would appear to
increase by an amount E=(3/8)mc^2, which in early 1905 he corrected to
E=(3/4)mc^2. Because relativistic corrections come in at order v^2/c^2 and
Hasenohrl's gedankenexperiment evidently required calculations only to order
v/c, it is initially puzzling why he did not achieve the answer universally
accepted today. Moreover, that $m$ should be equal to (4/3)E/c^2 has led
commentators to believe that this problem is identical to the famous ""4/3

Hasenohrl's mistake to neglect of the cavity stresses. We examine Hasenohrl's

of the predictions that result from our comparison is that the ejecta of some

central stars of the PNe that were shaped by ILOTs should have a main-sequence
binary companion with an eccentric orbit of several years long period.

the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) exhibits anomalously low
correlation at large angles. Quantifying the degree to which this feature in
the temperature data is in conflict with standard Lambda-CDM cosmology is
somewhat ambiguous because of the a posteriori nature of the observation. One
physical mechanism that has been proposed as a possible explanation for the
deficit in the large-angle temperature correlations is a suppression of
primordial power on ~Gpc scales. To distinguish whether the anomaly is a signal
of new physics, such as suppressed primordial power, it would be invaluable to
perform experimental tests of the authenticity of this signal in data sets
which are independent of the WMAP temperature measurements or even other CMB
measurements. We explore the possibility of testing models of power suppression
with large-scale structure observations, and compare the ability of planned
photometric and spectroscopic surveys to constrain the power spectrum. Of the
surveys planned for the next decade, a spectroscopic redshift survey such as
BigBOSS will have a greater number of radial modes available for study, but we
find that this advantage is outweighed by the greater surface density of
high-redshift sources that will be observed by photometric surveys such as LSST
or Euclid. We also find that the ability to constrain primordial power
suppression is insensitive to the precision of the calibration of photometric
redshifts. We conclude that very-wide-area imaging surveys have the potential
to probe viable models for the missing power but that it will be difficult to
use such surveys to conclusively rule out primordial power suppression as the
mechanism behind the observed anomaly.

driven effects and to increase the statistical significance, a very large set
of N-body integrations with different particle numbers N, ranging from 10^{3}
to 0.5 \cdot 10^{6} particles, is performed. Three different black hole capture
radii are taken into account, enabling us to scale these results to a broad
range of astrophysical systems with relaxation times shorter than one Hubble
time, i.e. for SMBHs up to M_bh \approx 10^{7} M_sun. The computed number of
disrupted stars are driven by diffusion in angular momentum space into the loss
cone of the black hole and the rate scales with the total number of particles
as dN/dt \propto N^{b}, where b is as large as 0.83. This is significantly
steeper than the expected scaling dN/dt \propto ln(N) derived from simplest
energy relaxation arguments. Only a relatively modest dependence of the tidal
disruption rate on the mass of the SMBH is found and we discuss our results in
the context of the M_bh/sigma relation. The number of disrupted stars
contribute a significant part to the mass growth of black holes in the lower
mass range as long as a significant part of the stellar mass becomes swallowed
by the SMBH. This also bears direct consequences for the search and existence
of IMBHs in globular clusters. For SMBHs similar to the galactic center black
hole SgrA*, a tidal disruption rate of 55 \pm 27 events per Myr is deduced.

impeding the diffusion of charged particles perpendicular to magnetic field
direction. This modification of transport processes is of vital importance for
a wide variety of astrophysical processes including cosmic ray transport,
transfer of heavy elements in the interstellar medium, star formation etc.
Dealing with these processes one should keep in mind that in realistic
astrophysical conditions magnetized fluids are turbulent. In this review we
single out a single transport process, namely, heat transfer and consider how
it occurs in the presence of the magnetized turbulence. We show that the
ability of magnetic field lines to constantly change topology and connectivity
is at the heart of the correct description of the 3D magnetic field
stochasticity in turbulent fluids. This ability is ensured by fast magnetic
reconnection in turbulent fluids and puts forward the concept of reconnection
diffusion at the core of the physical picture of heat transfer in astrophysical
plasmas. Appealing to reconnection diffusion we describe the ability of plasma
to diffuse between different magnetized eddies explaining the advection of the
heat by turbulence. Adopting the structure of magnetic field that follows from
the modern understanding of MHD turbulence, we also discuss thermal
conductivity that arises as electrons stream along stochastic magnetic field
lines. We compare the effective heat transport that arise from the two
processes and conclude that in many astrophysically-motivated cased eddy
advection of heat dominates. Finally, we discuss the concepts of sub and
superdiffusion and show that the subdiffusion requires rather restrictive
settings. At the same time, accelerated diffusion or superdiffusion of heat is
possible on the scales less than the injection scale of the turbulence.

learning the \emph{Markov network structure} from data. Such problem has become
increasingly important in machine learning, and many other application fields
of machine learning. Markov networks, together with Bayesian networks, are
probabilistic graphical models, a widely used formalism for handling
probability distributions in intelligent systems. Learning graphical models
from data have been extensively applied for the case of Bayesian networks, but
for Markov networks learning it is not tractable in practice. However, this
situation is changing with time, given the exponential growth of computers
capacity, the plethora of available digital data, and the researching on new
learning technologies. This work stresses on a technology called
independence-based learning, which allows the learning of the independence
structure of those networks from data in an efficient and sound manner,
whenever the dataset is sufficiently large, and data is a representative
sampling of the target distribution. In the analysis of such technology, this
work surveys the current state-of-the-art algorithms for learning Markov
networks structure, discussing its current limitations, and proposing a series
of open problems where future works may produce some advances in the area in
terms of quality and efficiency. The paper concludes by opening a discussion
about how to develop a general formalism for improving the quality of the
structures learned, when data is scarce.

power-law slope gamma=2, inherited from hierarchical fragmentation of molecular
clouds into clumps and clumps into stars. The well-known, logarithmic Salpeter
slope GAMMA=1.35 in clusters is then the aggregate slope for all the
star-forming clumps contributing to an individual cluster, and it is steeper
than the intrinsic slope within individual clumps because the smallest
star-forming clumps contributing to any given cluster are unable to form the
highest-mass stars. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the Salpeter
power-law index is the limiting value obtained for the cluster IMF when the
lower-mass limits for allowed stellar masses and star-forming clumps are
effectively equal, m_lo = M_lo. This condition indeed is imposed for the
high-mass IMF tail by the turn-over at the characteristic value m_c ~ 1 M_sun.
IMF slopes of GAMMA ~ 2 are obtained if the stellar and clump upper-mass limits
are also equal m_up = M_up ~ 100 M_sun, and so our model explains the observed
range of IMF slopes between GAMMA ~ 1 to 2. Flatter slopes of GAMMA = 1 are
expected when M_lo > m_up, which is a plausible condition in starbursts, where
such slopes are suggested to occur. While this model is a simplistic
parameterization of the star-formation process, it seems likely to capture the
essential elements that generate the Salpeter tail of the IMF for massive
stars. These principles also likely explain the IGIMF effect seen in
low-density star-forming environments.

obtained by taking a limit as N -> infinity of these curves scaled around
(0,2^{1/2} N) horizontally by a factor of N^{2/3} and vertically by N^{1/3}. If
a parabola is added to each limit curve, an x-translation invariant process
sometimes called the multi-line Airy process is obtained. We prove the
existence of a version of this process (which we call the Airy line ensemble)
in which curves are a.s. everywhere continuous and non-intersecting. This
process naturally arises in the study of growth processes and random matrix
ensembles, as do related processes with ""wanderers"" and ""outliers"". We
formulate our results to treat these relatives as well.
  Note that the law of the finite collection of Brownian bridges above has the
property -- called the Brownian Gibbs property -- of being invariant under the
following action. Select an index 1 <= k <= N and erase B_k on a fixed time
interval (a,b) subset of (-N,N); then replace this erased curve with a new
curve on (a,b) according to the law of a Brownian bridge between the two
existing endpoints (a,B_k(a)) and (b,B_k(b)), conditioned to intersect neither
the curve above nor the one below. We show that this property is preserved
under the edge-scaling limit and thus establish that the Airy line ensemble has
the Brownian Gibbs property.
  An immediate consequence is a proof of M. Prahofer and H. Spohn's prediction
that the lines of the Airy line ensemble are locally absolutely continuous with
respect to Brownian motion. We also prove the conjecture of K. Johansson that
the top line of the Airy line ensemble minus a parabola attains its maximum at
a unique point, thus establishing the asymptotic law of the transversal
fluctuation of last passage percolation with geometric weights.

darkest exoplanet currently known. By analysis of the orbital photometry from
publicly available Kepler data (0.4-0.9 microns), we determine a day-night
contrast amplitude of (6.5 +/- 1.9 ppm), constituting the lowest amplitude
orbital phase variation discovered. The signal is detected to 3.7 sigma
confidence and persists in six different methods of modelling the data and thus
appears robust. In contrast, we are unable to detect ellipsoidal variations or
beaming effects, but we do provide confidence intervals for these terms. If the
day-night contrast is interpreted as being due to scattering, it corresponds to
a geometric albedo of Ag = 0.0253 +/- 0.0072. However, our models indicate that
there is a significant emission component to day-side brightness, and the true
albedo is even lower (<1%). By combining our measurement with Spitzer and
ground-based data, we show that a model with moderate redistribution (Pn ~ 0.3)
and moderate extra optical opacity (kappa' ~ 0.3-0.4) provide a compatible
explanation to the data.

theory of Chandler allows the rate constant to be extracted from the plateau
region of an appropriate reactive flux function. However, when applied to real
data from single-molecule experiments or molecular dynamics simulations, the
rate can sometimes be difficult to extract due to the numerical differentiation
of a noisy empirical correlation function or difficulty in locating the plateau

new spectral shells for flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence. We derive
explicit cQPA propagators and Feynman rules for the transport theory. In
particular the nontrivial Wightman functions can be written as composite

strongly influence CP-violating flavour mixing even for relatively
slowly-varying backgrounds. Thus, unlike recently suggested, these correlations
cannot be neglected when studying asymmetry generation due to time-varying mass

communications over insecure channels. When legitimate communicating parties
are willing to spend an amount of computational effort proportional to some
parameter N, an eavesdropper cannot break into their communication without
spending a time proportional to N^2, which is quadratically more than the
legitimate effort. Two of us showed in 2008 that Merkle's schemes are
completely insecure against a quantum adversary, but that their security can be
partially restored if the legitimate parties are also allowed to use quantum
computation: the eavesdropper needed to spend a time proportional to N^{3/2} to
break our earlier quantum scheme. Furthermore, all previous classical schemes
could be broken completely by the onslaught of a quantum eavesdropper and we
conjectured that this is unavoidable.
  We give now two novel key establishment schemes in the spirit of Merkle's.
The first one can be broken by a quantum adversary who makes an effort
proportional to N^{5/3}, which is the optimal attack against this scheme. Our
second scheme is purely classical, yet it cannot be broken by a quantum
eavesdropper who is only willing to expend an effort proportional to that of
the legitimate parties.
  We then introduce two families of more elaborate protocols. The first family
consists in quantum protocols whose security is arbitrarily close to quadratic
in the query complexity model. The second is a family of classical protocols
whose security against a quantum adversary is arbitrarily close to N^{3/2} in
the same model.

the experimental data and the calculations. Agreement is improved if magnetism
is included in the calculations via the local spin density approximation, as
the Fe atomic motions parallel to the ferromagnetic ordering direction are
softened. However, the antiferromagnetically polarized modes remain hard, and
in disagreement with the experimental data. In fact, given the increasing
evidence for anisotropy in the iron pnictide materials, the phonon response is
surprisingly isotropic. We consider several modifications of the ab initio
calculations to improve the agreement with the experimental data. Improved
agreement is found by setting the matrix to zero (clipping the bond) between
nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetically aligned Fe atoms in the magnetic
calculation, or by softening only the in-plane nearest-neighbor Fe-As force
constant in the nonmagnetic calculation. We discuss these results in the
context of other measurements, especially of phonons, for several FeAs systems.
Fluctuating magnetism may be a partial explanation for the failure of the
calculations, but seems incomplete in the face of the similarity of the
measured phonon response in all the systems investigated here including those
known to have static magnetism.

on the unique diagnostic tools available in the visible and near infrared

emission lines in this wavelength range, over their extreme ultraviolet

observations out to a few solar radii, (2) the higher spectral selectivity
available for imaging, giving well-defined temperature responses for each

measurements in a number of spectral lines. Consequently, the evolution of the

important region of the corona where the expansion of the solar magnetic field
and the acceleration of the solar wind occur. Since the planning of eclipse

the first proof deals with the poles of the single-particle Green's function

Thus, there may be multiple Nambu-Goldstone bosons even in the single-component

lifetime in the long-wavelength limit in agreement with the conventional
viewpoint. In contrast, the first mode from $\hat{G}$, i.e., the Bogoliubov

temporally out of and back into the condensate. The substantial lifetime
originates from an ""improper"" structure of the self-energy inherent in the BEC,

  Control Conference, Yantai (China), July 22-24, 2011, 6267-6273, ISBN:

a model-based control law in presence of parametric and structural
uncertainties. The control law is usually a complex feedback law which is
derived from a (nonlinear) model, possibly complemented with some mathematical
envelope of the model uncertainty. Stability may be guarantee with the help of
some ignorance coefficients and restricting the feedback control effort with
respect to the model-based design. Embedded Model Control shows that under
certain conditions, the model-based control law must and can be kept intact
under uncertainty, if the controllable dynamics is complemented by a suitable
disturbance dynamics capable of real-time encoding the different uncertainties
affecting the 'embedded model', i.e. the model which is both the design source
and the core of the control unit. To be real-time updated the disturbance state
is driven by an unpredictable input vector, called noise, which can be only
estimated from the model error. The uncertainty (or plant)-based design
concerns the noise estimator, as the model error may convey into the embedded
model uncertainty components (parametric, cross-coupling, neglected dynamics)
which are command-dependent and thus prone to destabilize the controlled plant.
Separation of the components into the low and high frequency domain by the
noise estimator allows to recover and guarantee stability, and to cancel the
low frequency ones from the plant. Among the advantages, control algorithms are
neatly and univocally related to the embedded model, the embedded model
provides a real-time image of the plant, all control gains are tuned by fixing
closed-loop eigenvalues. Last but not least, the resulting control unit has
modular structure and algorithms, thus facilitating coding. A simulated case
study helps to understand the key assets of the methodology.

Monoceros OB1 molecular cloud. Various infrared reflection nebulae clusters
(IRNCs) associated with NGC 2264 IRS 2 and IRAS 12 S1 core were detected as
well as local infrared reflection nebulae (IRNe). The illuminating sources of
the IRNe were identified with known or new near- and mid-IR sources. In
addition, 314 point-like sources were detected in all three bands and their
aperture polarimetry was studied. Using a color-color diagram, reddened field
stars and diskless pre-main sequence stars were selected to trace the magnetic
field (MF) structure of the molecular cloud. The mean polarization position
angle of the point-like sources is 81 \pm 29 degree in the cluster core, and 58
\pm 24 degree in the perimeter of the cluster core, which is interpreted as the
projected direction on the sky of the MF in the observed region of the cloud.
The Chandrasekhar-Fermi method gives a rough estimate of the MF strength to be
about 100 {\mu}G. A comparison with recent numerical simulations of the cluster
formation implies that the cloud dynamics is controlled by the relatively
strong MF. The local MF direction is well associated with that of CO outflow
for IRAS 12 S1 and consistent with that inferred from submillimeter
polarimetry. In contrast, the local MF direction runs roughly perpendicular to
the Galactic MF direction.

isothermal sphere model and the King model in the limit of Newtonian gravity.
The common feature of these halos is that the density of a halo in the outer
region is larger (smaller) in the sDGP (galileon) model, respectively, in
comparison with Newtonian gravity. This comes from the suppression
(enhancement) of the effective gravity at large distance in the sDGP (galileon)
model, respectively. However, the difference between these modified gravity
models and Newtonian gravity only appears outside the halo due to the
Vainshtein mechanism, which makes it difficult to distinguish between them. We
also discuss the case in which the halo density profile is fixed independently
of the gravity model for comparison between our results and previous work.

Whenever a property is refuted, a counterexample trace is delivered that
reveals an undesired, erroneous navigation sequence. Unfortunately, the
analysis (or even the simple inspection) of such counterexamples may be
unfeasible because of the size and complexity of the traces under examination.
In this paper, we endow Web-TLR with a new Web debugging facility that supports
the efficient manipulation of counterexample traces. This facility is based on
a backward trace-slicing technique for rewriting logic theories that allows the
pieces of information that we are interested to be traced back through inverse
rewrite sequences. The slicing process drastically simplifies the computation
trace by dropping useless data that do not influence the final result. By using
this facility, the Web engineer can focus on the relevant fragments of the

the distribution and kinematics of galaxies. To detect HI beyond the ionisation
edge of galaxy disks, column density sensitivities have to be achieved that
probe the regime of Lyman limit systems. Typically HI observations are limited
to a brightness sensitivity of NHI~10^19 cm-2 but this has to be improved by at
least an order of magnitude. In this paper, reprocessed data is presented that
was originally observed for the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). HIPASS
provides complete coverage of the region that has been observed for the
Westerbork Virgo Filament HI Survey (WVFS), presented in accompanying papers,
and thus is an excellent product for data comparison. The region of interest
extends from 8 to 17 hours in right ascension and from -1 to 10 degrees in
declination. Although the original HIPASS product already has good flux
sensitivity, the sensitivity and noise characteristics can be significantly
improved with a different processing method. The newly processed data has an
1sigma RMS flux sensitivity of ~10 mJy beam-1 over 26 km s-1, corresponding to
a column density sensitivity of ~3\cdot10^17 cm-2. While the RMS sensitivity is
improved by only a modest 20%, the more substantial benefit is in the reduction
of spectral artefacts near bright sources by more than an order of magnitude.
In the reprocessed region we confirm all previously catalogued HIPASS sources
and have identified 29 additional sources of which 14 are completely new HI
detections. Extended emission or companions were sought in the nearby
environment of each discrete detection. With the improved sensitivity after
reprocessing and its large sky coverage, the HIPASS data is a valuable resource
for detection of faint HI emission.(Abridged)

  Methods: We use the simultaneously observed standard-stars as PSF reference

yields the flux residuals produced by the star-disk system. A detection

study of computationally more tractable and practical SAT instances. We give
two simple algorithms. One that runs simultaneously in time-space
$(O^*(2^{2tw(\phi)}), O^*(2^{tw(\phi)}))$ and another that runs in time-space
$(O^*(3^{tw(\phi)\log{|\phi|}}),|\phi|^{O(1)})$, where $tw(\phi)$ is the
tree-width of a formula $\phi$ with $|\phi|$ many clauses and variables. This
partially answers the question of Alekhnovitch and Razborov, who also gave
algorithms exponential both in time and space, and asked whether the space can
be made smaller. We conjecture that every algorithm for this problem that runs
in time $2^{tw(\phi)\mathbf{o(\log{|\phi|})}}$ necessarily blows up the space
to exponential in $tw(\phi)$.
  We introduce a novel way to combine the two simple algorithms that allows us
to trade \emph{constant} factors in the exponents between running time and

parameters. By fixing one parameter we obtain an algorithm that runs in

of this technique, and show that these algorithmic results are the best
achievable using this technique.

which creates a bi-directional magnonic pulse in the ferrite film. Conversion
of magnons to spin current occurs at the ferrite-metal interface, and the
resulting spin-transfer torque is used to achieve sub-nanosecond precessional
switching of the ferromagnetic free layer in the MTJ. Compared to electric
current driven STT-MRAM with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA),
thermoelectric STT-MRAM reduces the overall magnetization switching energy by
more than 40% for nano-second switching, combined with a write error rate (WER)
of less than 10-9 and a lifetime of 10 years or higher. The combination of
higher thermal activation energy, sub-nanosecond read/write speed, improved

significant asymmetry in 11 objects. There is a clear preference for blue
asymmetries, which are found in 9/13 quasars at 10% intensity level. In
coherence with studies on other types of active and non active galaxies, we
propose that the asymmetries are produced by outflows where differential dust
extinction is at work.
  This scenario is favoured by other results we find: in addition to quiescent
ambient gas, whose kinematic properties are consistent with gravitational
motions, we have discovered highly perturbed gas in all objects. This gas emits
very broad lines (R=FWHM[OIII]/FWHM(stars)>~2). While the quiescent gas shows
small or null velocity shifts relative to the systemic velocity, the highly
perturbed gas trends to show larger shifts which, moreover, are blueshifts in
general. Within a given object, the most perturbed gas trends to have the
largest blueshift as well. All together support that the perturbed gas, which
is responsible for the blue asymmetries of the line profiles, is outflowing.
Although some bias affects the sample, we argue that ionized gas outflows are a
common phenomenon in optically selected type 2 quasars at 0.3< z < 0.6.

spherically symmetric, equilibrium Jeans models imply that the product of
halflight radius and (squared) stellar velocity dispersion provides an estimate
of the mass enclosed within the halflight radius of a dSph stellar component,
and 2) some dSphs have chemo-dynamically distinct stellar

potential. We devise a statistical method that uses measurements of stellar
positions, velocities and spectral indices to distinguish two dSph stellar
subcomponents and to estimate their individual halflight radii and velocity
dispersions. For a dSph with two detected stellar subcomponents, we obtain
estimates of masses enclosed at two discrete points in the same mass profile,
immediately defining a slope. Applied to published spectroscopic data, our

values are consistent with 'cores' of constant density within the central

method tends systematically to overestimate the mass of the inner stellar
subcomponent to a greater degree than that of the outer stellar subcomponent,
and therefore to underestimate the slope $\Gamma$ (implying that the stated NFW
exclusion levels are conservative).

redshift may look similar to very high redshift galaxies in the optical/near
infrared (NIR) domain. This can lead to the contamination of high redshift
galaxy searches based on broad band optical/NIR photometry by lower redshift
dusty galaxies as both kind of galaxies cannot be distinguished. The
contamination rate could be as high as 50%. {This work shows how the far
infrared (FIR) domain can help to recognize likely low-z interlopers in an
optical/NIR search for high-z galaxies.} We analyse the FIR SEDs of two
galaxies proposed as very high redshift ($z>7$) dropout candidates based on
deep Hawk-I/VLT observations. The FIR SEDs are sampled with PACS/Herschel at
100 and 160\,$\mu$m, with SPIRE/Herschel at 250, 350 and 500\,$\mu$m and with
LABOCA/APEX at 870\,$\mu$m. We find that redshifts $>7$ would imply extreme FIR
SEDs (with dust temperatures $>100$\,K and FIR luminosities
$>10^{13}$\,$L_{\odot}$). At z$\sim$2, instead, the SEDs of both sources would
be compatible with that of typical ULIRGs/SMGs. Considering all the data
available for these sources from visible to FIR we re-estimate the redshifts
and we find $z\sim$1.6--2.5. Due to the strong spectral breaks observed in
these galaxies, standard templates from the literature fail to reproduce the
visible-near IR part of the SEDs even when additional extinction is included.
These sources resemble strongly dust obscured galaxies selected in Spitzer
observations with extreme visible-to-FIR colors, and the galaxy GN10 at $z=4$.
Galaxies with similar SEDs could contaminate other high redshift surveys.

large-scale, spatially extended stochastic neuronal networks with delays.
Rigorously, the asymptotic regime of such systems is characterized by a very
intricate stochastic delayed integro-differential McKean-Vlasov equation that
remain impenetrable, leaving the stochastic collective dynamics of such
networks poorly understood. In order to study these macroscopic dynamics, we
analyze networks of firing-rate neurons, i.e. with linear intrinsic dynamics
and sigmoidal interactions. In that case, we prove that the solution of the
mean-field equation is Gaussian, hence characterized by its two first moments,
and that these two quantities satisfy a set of coupled delayed
integro-differential equations. These equations are similar to usual neural
field equations, and incorporate noise levels as a parameter, allowing analysis
of noise-induced transitions. We identify through bifurcation analysis several
qualitative transitions due to noise in the mean-field limit. In particular,
stabilization of spatially homogeneous solutions, synchronized oscillations,
bumps, chaotic dynamics, wave or bump splitting are exhibited and arise from
static or dynamic Turing-Hopf bifurcations. These surprising phenomena allow
further exploring the role of noise in the nervous system.

estimating the intrinsic parameters mostly depends on the network signal to
noise ratio (SNR), but the resolution in the direction of arrival also strongly
depends on the network geometry.
  We compare results for 6 different existing and possible global networks and
two different choices of the parameter space. We show how the fraction of the

about 3 times when transitioning from the Hanford (USA), Livingston (USA) and
Cascina (Italy) network to possible 5 sites ones (while keeping the network SNR
fixed).
  The technique adopted here is an asymptotic expansion of the uncertainties in
inverse powers of the signal to noise ratio where the first order is the
inverse Fisher information matrix. We show that a common approach to use
simplified parameter spaces and only the Fisher information matrix can largely
underestimate the uncertainties (by a factor ~7 for the one sigma sky
uncertainty in square degrees at a network SNR of ~15).

reproduce roughly the observed orbital parameters such as eccentricities and
inclinations of the Kuiper Belt. It is known now that in Galactic environments,
such as stellar formation regions, the stellar densities of new born stars, are
high enough to produce close encounters within 200 AU. Moreover, in these

experiments. The unified model suggests that all gravitational, strong and
electroweak interactions appear to be dictated by gauge symmetries in the
generalized Yang-Mills framework.

occur through the 2-loop vertex renormalisation of the physical 1PI couplings.
We describe this effect and construct models in which this occurs. For models

analyse the tension between such models and constraints from low-energy flavour

interactions. In order to check for the effect of leading bulk corrections we
have also simulated the spin-1/2 Ising model on the simple cubic lattice. We
have accurately estimated the surface enhancement coupling at the special point

surface renormalization group exponents of the special transitions. These
results are compared with previous ones obtained by using field theoretic

study the behaviour of the surface transition near the special point and
finally we discuss films with special boundary conditions at one surface and

five galaxies having no detectable X-ray emission. Comparing X-ray luminosity
and star formation rate, we find that the total X-ray luminosity of the sample
is more than 10 times greater than expected if X-ray luminosity scales with
star formation rate according to the relation found for normal-metallicity
star-forming galaxies. However, due to the low number of sources detected, one
can exclude the hypothesis that the relation of the X-ray binaries to SFR in
low-metalicity BCDs is identical to that in normal galaxies only at the 96.6%
confidence level. It has recently been proposed that X-ray binaries were an
important source of heating and reionization of the intergalactic medium at the
epoch of reionization. If BCDs are analogs to unevolved galaxies in the early
universe, then enhanced X-ray binary production in BCDs would suggest an
enhanced impact of X-ray binaries on the early thermal history of the universe.

inspired by the hairpin formation in DNA biochemistry and by DNA computing. In
this paper we investigate the hairpin completion of regular languages.
  It is well known that hairpin completions of regular languages are linear
context-free and not necessarily regular. As regularity of a (linear)
context-free language is not decidable, the question arose whether regularity
of a hairpin completion of regular languages is decidable. We prove that this
problem is decidable and we provide a polynomial time algorithm.
  Furthermore, we prove that the hairpin completion of regular languages is an
unambiguous linear context-free language and, as such, it has an effectively
computable growth function. Moreover, we show that the growth of the hairpin
completion is exponential if and only if the growth of the underlying languages
is exponential and, in case the hairpin completion is regular, then the hairpin
completion and the underlying languages have the same growth indicator.

wellknown solutions in homogeneous case. We have also calculated the effective
deceleration parameter in terms of Hubble parameter. The whole situation is
