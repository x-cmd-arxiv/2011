pulsational study of M dwarf stellar models with masses in the range 0.1 to
0.5M_solar. We find the fundamental radial mode to be unstable due to an
\epsilon mechanism caused by deuterium (D-) burning for the young 0.1 and
0.2M_solar models, by non-equilibrium He^3 burning for the 0.2 and 0.25M_solar
models of 10^4Myr, and by a flux blocking mechanism for the partially
convective 0.4 and 0.5M_solar models once they reach the age of 500Myr. The
periods of the overstable modes excited by the D-burning are in the range 4.2
to 5.2h for the 0.1M_solar models and is of order 8.4h for the 0.2M_solar
models. The periods of the modes excited by He^3 burning and flux blocking are
in the range 23 to 40min. The more massive and oldest models are more promising
for the observational detection of pulsations, as their ratio of instability
e-folding time to age is more favourable.

devices have fueled the exploration of high carrier mobility semiconductors as
a Si replacement to further enhance the device performance. In particular,
compound semiconductors heterogeneously integrated on Si substrates have been
actively studied, combining the high mobility of III-V semiconductors and the
well-established, low cost processing of Si technology. This integration,
however, presents significant challenges. Conventionally, heteroepitaxial
growth of complex multilayers on Si has been explored. Besides complexity, high
defect densities and junction leakage currents present limitations in the
approach. Motivated by this challenge, here we utilize an epitaxial transfer
method for the integration of ultrathin layers of single-crystalline InAs on
Si/SiO2 substrates. As a parallel to silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology14,we
use the abbreviation ""XOI"" to represent our compound semiconductor-on-insulator
platform. Through experiments and simulation, the electrical properties of InAs
XOI transistors are explored, elucidating the critical role of quantum
confinement in the transport properties of ultrathin XOI layers. Importantly, a
high quality InAs/dielectric interface is obtained by the use of a novel
thermally grown interfacial InAsOx layer (~1 nm thick). The fabricated FETs
exhibit an impressive peak transconductance of ~1.6 mS/{\mu}m at VDS=0.5V with
ON/OFF current ratio of greater than 10,000 and a subthreshold swing of 107-150
mV/decade for a channel length of ~0.5 {\mu}m.

an effective Lagrangian approach to confront these models with the existing

iterative decoding of all correctable erasure patterns of size $s$ or less. The
problem is to derive bounds on the minimum size $F(r,s)$ of generic erasure
correcting sets and to find constructions for such sets. In this paper we
continue the study of these sets. We derive better lower and upper bounds.

slowly rising inside the influence radius of the supermassive black hole
(SMBH). Attributing the dynamical friction force to stars moving more slowly
than the test body, as is commonly done, is likely to be a poor approximation
in such a core since there are no stars moving more slowly than the local
circular velocity. We have tested this prediction using large-scale N-body
experiments. The rate of orbital decay never drops precisely to zero, because
stars moving faster than the test body also contribute to the frictional force.
When the contribution from the fast-moving stars is included in the expression
for the dynamical friction force, and the changes induced by the massive body
on the stellar distribution are taken into account, Chandrasekhar's theory is
found to reproduce the rate of orbital decay remarkably well. However, this
rate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by Chandrasekhar's
formula in its most widely-used forms, implying longer time scales for
inspiral. Motivated by recent observations that suggest a parsec-scale core
around the Galactic center SMBH, we investigate the evolution of a population
of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) as they spiral in to the center of the
Galaxy. After ~10Gyr, we find that the density of BHs can remain substantially
less than the density in stars at all radii; we conclude that it would be
unjustified to assume that the spatial distribution of BHs at the Galactic
center is well described by steady-state models. One consequence is that rates
of capture of BHs by the SMBH at the Galactic center (EMRIs) may be much lower
than in standard models. We finally study the orbital decay of satellite
galaxies into the central region of giant ellipticals and discuss the formation
of multiple nuclei and multiplet of black holes in such systems.

compression. The algorithm 1) predicts bits sequentially from those previously
seen and 2) has a structure and a number of computations similar to an
autoencoder. The likelihood under the model can be calculated exactly, and
arithmetic coding can be used directly for compression. When training on digits
the algorithm learns filters similar to those of restricted boltzman machines

a single sweep through the pixels. The algorithm has a good compression

domain, we will investigate a simple iterative approximation algorithm based on
the method by Frank & Wolfe 1956, that does not need projection steps in order
to stay inside the optimization domain. Instead of a projection step, the
linearized problem defined by a current subgradient is solved, which gives a
step direction that will naturally stay in the domain. Our framework
generalizes the sparse greedy algorithm of Frank & Wolfe and its primal-dual
analysis by Clarkson 2010 (and the low-rank SDP approach by Hazan 2008) to
arbitrary convex domains. We give a convergence proof guaranteeing
{\epsilon}-small duality gap after O(1/{\epsilon}) iterations.
  The method allows us to understand the sparsity of approximate solutions for
any l1-regularized convex optimization problem (and for optimization over the
simplex), expressed as a function of the approximation quality. We obtain
matching upper and lower bounds of {\Theta}(1/{\epsilon}) for the sparsity for
l1-problems. The same bounds apply to low-rank semidefinite optimization with
bounded trace, showing that rank O(1/{\epsilon}) is best possible here as well.
As another application, we obtain sparse matrices of O(1/{\epsilon}) non-zero
entries as {\epsilon}-approximate solutions when optimizing any convex function
over a class of diagonally dominant symmetric matrices.
  We show that our proposed first-order method also applies to nuclear norm and
max-norm matrix optimization problems. For nuclear norm regularized
optimization, such as matrix completion and low-rank recovery, we demonstrate
the practical efficiency and scalability of our algorithm for large matrix
problems, as e.g. the Netflix dataset. For general convex optimization over
bounded matrix max-norm, our algorithm is the first with a convergence
guarantee, to the best of our knowledge.

in systematic searches for galaxy-cluster-scale strong lenses in the Second
Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
The cluster lenses span 0.2 < z_lens < 1.2 in redshift, with a median z_lens =
0.58. Using broadband color criteria we sort the entire arc sample into
redshift bins based on u-g and g-r colors, and also r-z colors for the ~90% of
arcs that have z-band data. This analysis yields broad redshift constraints
with 71 +5 -4 % of the arcs at z > 1.0, 64 +6 -4 % at z > 1.4, 56 +5 -4 % at z
> 1.9, and 21 +4 -2 % at z > 2.7. The remaining 29 +3 -5 % have z < 1. The
inferred median redshift is z_s = 2.0 +/- 0.1, in good agreement with a
previous determination from a smaller sample of brighter arcs (g < 22.5). This
agreement confirms that z_s = 2.0 +/- 0.1 is the typical redshift for giant
arcs with g < 24 that are produced by cluster-scale strong lenses, and that
there is no evidence for strong evolution in the redshift distribution of arcs
over a wide range of g-band magnitudes (20 < g < 24). Establishing that half of
all giant arcs are at z > 2 contributes significantly toward relieving the
tension between the number of arcs observed and the number expected in a
Lambda-CDM cosmology, but there is considerable evidence to suggest that a
discrepancy persists. Additionally, this work confirms that forthcoming large

Design problem (Cap-SNDP). The Cap-SNDP is the problem of satisfying
connectivity requirements when edges have costs and hard capacities. We begin
by showing that the Group Steiner tree problem (GST) is a special case of
Cap-SNDP even when there is connectivity requirement between only one
source-sink pair. This implies the first poly-logarithmic lower bound for the
Cap-SNDP. We next provide combinatorial algorithms for several special cases of
this problem. The Cap-SNDP is equivalent to its special case when every edge
has either zero cost or infinite capacity. We consider a special case, called
Connected Cap-SNDP, where all infinite-capacity edges in the solution are
required to form a connected component containing the sinks. This problem is
motivated by its similarity to the Connected Facility Location problem
[G+01,SW04]. We solve this problem by reducing it to Submodular tree cover
problem, which is a common generalization of Connected Cap-SNDP and Group
Steiner tree problem. We generalize the recursive greedy algorithm [CEK]
achieving a poly-logarithmic approximation algorithm for Submodular tree cover
problem. This result is interesting in its own right and gives the first
poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms for Connected hard capacities set
multi-cover and Connected source location.
  We then study another special case of Cap-SNDP called Unbalanced
point-to-point connection problem. Besides its practical applications to shift
design problems [EKS], it generalizes many problems such as k-MST, Steiner
Forest and Point-to-Point Connection. We give a combinatorial logarithmic
approximation algorithm for this problem by reducing it to degree-bounded SNDP.

mass of the BH and NS, respectively. We model NS matter by systematically

estimate the BH spin and assuming an irrotational velocity field for the fluid

by an adaptive mesh refinement code, SACRA. The treatment of hydrodynamic

tidally disrupted irrespective of the mass ratio when the BH has a moderately
large prograde spin, whereas only binaries with low mass ratios, MBH/MNS <~ 3
or small compactnesses of the NSs, bring the tidal disruption when the BH spin
is zero or retrograde. The mass of the remnant disk is accordingly large as >~
0.1 Msun, which is required by central engines of short gamma-ray bursts, if
the BH spin is prograde. Information of the tidal disruption is reflected in a
clear relation between the compactness of the NS and an appropriately defined

damps exponentially. We find that the tidal disruption of the NS and excitation
of the quasinormal mode of the remnant BH occur in a compatible manner in high
mass-ratio binaries with the prograde BH spin. The correlation between the
compactness and the cutoff frequency still holds for such cases. It is also

a strong increase in the frequency of planet occurrence around stars more

mass stars, which are hostile to precision Doppler measurements due to rotation
and activity while on the main sequence. This paper considers the observed
$v\sin i$ and observationally inferred mass for exoplanet hosting giants with
the $v\sin i$ of distribution of field stars, which show discrepancies that can
be explained by erroneous mass determinations of some exoplanet host stars. By
comparison with an expected mass distribution constructed from integrating
isochrones, it is shown that the exoplanet hosts are inconsistent with a
population of massive stars. These stars are more likely to have originated
from a main sequence population of late F/early G dwarfs with mass 1.0--$1.2
M_\odot$, only slightly more more massive than the typical FGK dwarfs with
Doppler detected planets. The deficit of short period planets is most likely
explained by tidal capture. The planet abundance difference requires either a
steeper increase in planet frequency with mass than previously thought or a
high rate of false positives due to signals of stellar origin. The measurement
of photospheric Carbon isotope ratios is suggested as a method to discriminate
whether this sample of giant stars is significantly more massive than the

galaxies of the Milky Way, aimed at estimating the effect of the spatial
structure of reionisation at galaxy scale on the properties of the satellites.
In this model reionisation can be either: (A) externally-driven and uniform, or
(B) internally-driven, by the most massive progenitor of the Milky-Way. In the
latter scenario the propagation of the ionisation front and photon dilution
introduce a delay in the photo-evaporation of the outer satellites' gas with
respect to the inner satellites. As a consequence, outer satellites experience
a longer period of star formation than those in the inner halo. We use simple
models to account for star formation, the propagation of the ionisation front,
photo-evaporation and observational biases. Both scenarios yield a model
satellite population at z=0 that matches the observed luminosity function and
mass-to-light ratios. However, the predicted population for scenario (B) is
significantly more extended spatially than for scenario (A), by about 0.3 dex
in distance, resulting in a much better match to the observations. The survival
of this structural signature imprinted by the local UV field during
reionisation on the radial distribution of satellites makes it a promising tool
for studying the reionisation epoch at galaxy scale in the Milky Way and nearby
galaxies resolved in stars with forthcoming large surveys. However, more work
is needed to determine how the effect reported here can be disentangled from
that of cosmic variance between different realisations of Milky Way haloes.

accretion discs at large radii, where the temperature is low enough that
external irradiation likely contributes to the thermal balance. Irradiation is
known to weaken the strength of disc self-gravity, and can suppress it entirely
if the disc is maintained above the threshold for linear instability. However,
its impact on the susceptibility of the disc to fragmentation is less clear. We
use two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of
self-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of
irradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local
thermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be
represented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at
least 240 dynamical times). In this regime, the power spectrum of the
perturbations is uniquely set by the effective viscous alpha and not by the
cooling rate. Fragmentation occurs for cooling times tau < beta_crit / Omega,
where beta_crit is a weak function of the level of irradiation. We find that
beta_crit declines by approximately a factor of two, as irradiation is
increased from zero up to the level where instability is almost quenched. The
numerical results imply that irradiation cannot generally avert fragmentation
of self-gravitating discs at large radii; if other angular momentum transport
sources are weak mass will build up until self-gravity sets in, and
fragmentation will ensue.

of the galaxy two-point correlation function down to very small projected
separations (10 < r < 400 kpc/h), in a wide range of luminosity threshold
samples (absolute r-band magnitudes of -18 up to -23). We use a halo occupation
distribution (HOD) framework with free parameters that specify both the number
and spatial distribution of galaxies within their host dark matter halos. We
assume that the first galaxy in each halo lives at the halo center and that
additional satellite galaxies follow a radial density profile similar to the
dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, except that the concentration
and inner slope are allowed to vary. We find that in low luminosity samples,
satellite galaxies have radial profiles that are consistent with NFW. M_r < -20
and brighter satellite galaxies have radial profiles with significantly steeper
inner slopes than NFW (we find inner logarithmic slopes ranging from -1.6 to
-2.1, as opposed to -1 for NFW). We define a useful metric of concentration,
M_(1/10), which is the fraction of satellite galaxies (or mass) that are
enclosed within one tenth of the virial radius of a halo. We find that M_(1/10)
for low luminosity satellite galaxies agrees with NFW, whereas for luminous
galaxies it is 2.5-4 times higher, demonstrating that these galaxies are
substantially more centrally concentrated within their dark matter halos than
the dark matter itself. Our results therefore suggest that the processes that
govern the spatial distribution of galaxies, once they have merged into larger
halos, must be luminosity dependent, such that luminous galaxies become poor
tracers of the underlying dark matter.

dynamics and transport are difficult to answer using conventional field
theoretic methods. I argue that many of these can be addressed systematically

there are more exotic possibilities involving deconfined phases of gauge fields

survey data and (ii) to use these and simulation/forecast results to assess the
science case for a new, >10x larger, QSO survey. We first combine the SDSS, 2QZ
and 2SLAQ surveys to form a survey of ~60000 QSOs. We find a hint of a peak in
the QSO 2-point correlation function, xi(s), at the same scale (~105h^-1 Mpc)
as detected by Eisenstein et al (2005) in their sample of DR5 LRGs but only at
low statistical significance. We then compare these data with QSO mock
catalogues from the Hubble Volume simulation used by Hoyle et al (2002) and
find that both routes give statistical error estimates that are consistent at
~100h^-1 Mpc scales. Mock catalogues are then used to estimate the nominal
survey size needed for a 3-4 sigma detection of the BAO peak. We find that a
redshift survey of ~250000 z<2.2 QSOs is required over ~3000 deg^2. This is
further confirmed by static log-normal simulations where the BAO are clearly
detectable in the QSO power spectrum and correlation function. The nominal
survey would on its own produce the first detection of, for example,
discontinuous dark energy evolution in the so far uncharted 1<z<2.2 redshift
range. A survey with ~50% higher QSO sky densities and 50% bigger area will
give an ~6sigma BAO detection, leading to an error ~60% of the size of the BOSS
error on the dark energy evolution parameter, w_a.
  Another important aim for a QSO survey is to place new limits on primordial
non-Gaussianity at large scales, testing tentative evidence we have found for
the evolution of the linear form of the combined QSO xi(s) at z~1.6. Such a QSO
survey will also determine the gravitational growth rate at z~1.6 via z-space
distortions, allow lensing tomography via QSO magnification bias while also
measuring the exact luminosity dependence of small-scale QSO clustering.

used extensively to investigate the coherence dynamics of the central spin
model with the nuclear bath in a narrowed state characterized by a well defined
value of the Overhauser field. We revisit the perturbative NZ approach and
apply it to the exactly solvable case of a system with uniform hyperfine
couplings. This is motivated by the fact that the effective Hamiltonian-based
theory suggests that the dynamics of the realistic system at low magnetic
fields and short times can be mapped onto the uniform coupling model. We show
that the standard NZ approach fails to reproduce the exact solution of this
model beyond very short times, while the effective Hamiltonian calculation
agrees very well with the exact result on timescales during which most of the
coherence is lost. Our key finding is that in order to extend the timescale of
applicability of the NZ approach in this case, instead of using a single
projection operator one has to use a set of correlated projection operators
which properly reflect the symmetries of the problem and greatly improve the
convergence of the theory. This suggests that the correlated projection
operators are crucial for a proper description of narrowed state free induction
decay at short times and low magnetic fields. Our results thus provide
important insights toward the development of a more complete theory of central
spin decoherence applicable in a broader regime of timescales and magnetic
fields.

regions are excluded, the most relaxed clusters (or those with the strongest
cool cores) follow an LT relation with a slope that agrees well with simple
self-similar expectations. This is supported by an analysis of the gas density
profiles of the systems, which shows self-similar behaviour of the gas profiles
of the relaxed clusters outside the core regions. By comparing our data with
clusters in the REXCESS sample, which extends to lower masses, we find evidence
that the self-similar behaviour of even the most relaxed clusters breaks at
around 3.5keV. By contrast, the LT slopes of the subsamples of unrelaxed
systems (or those without strong cool cores) are significantly steeper than the
self-similar model, with lower mass systems appearing less luminous and higher
mass systems appearing more luminous than the self-similar relation. We argue
that these results are consistent with a model of non-gravitational energy
input in clusters that combines central heating with entropy enhancements from
merger shocks. Such enhancements could extend the impact of central energy
input to larger radii in unrelaxed clusters, as suggested by our data. We also
examine the evolution of the LT relation, and find that while the data appear
inconsistent with simple self-similar evolution, the differences can be
plausibly explained by selection bias, and thus we find no reason to rule out
self-similar evolution. We show that the fraction of cool core clusters in our
(non-representative) sample decreases at z>0.5 and discuss the effect of this
on measurements of the evolution in the LT relation.

shell, large amount of iron in the X-ray emitting ejecta, and lack of a compact
remnant support a Type Ia origin for this remnant. From hydrodynamic
simulations, the observed characteristics of RCW 86 are successfully reproduced
by an off-center explosion in a low-density cavity carved by the progenitor
system. This would make RCW 86 the first known case of a Type Ia supernova in a
wind-blown bubble. The fast shocks ($> 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) observed in the NE
are propagating in the low-density bubble, where the shock is just beginning to
encounter the shell, while the slower shocks elsewhere have already encountered
the bubble wall. The diffuse nature of the synchrotron emission in the SW and
NW is due to electrons that were accelerated early in the lifetime of the
remnant, when the shock was still in the bubble. Electrons in a bubble could
produce gamma-rays by inverse-Compton scattering. The wind-blown bubble
scenario requires a single-degenerate progenitor, which should leave behind a
companion star.

hypercontractive inequalities are implied by standard hypercontractive
inequalities as well as by the modified log-Sobolev inequality. Our proof is
based on a new comparison lemma for Dirichlet forms and an extension of the
Strook-Varapolos inequality.
  A consequence of our analysis is that {\em all} simple operators $L=Id-\E$ as
well as their tensors satisfy uniform reverse hypercontractive inequalities.
That is, for all $q<p<1$ and every positive valued function $f$ for $t \geq
\log \frac{1-q}{1-p}$ we have $\| e^{-tL}f\|_{q} \geq \| f\|_{p}$. This should
be contrasted with the case of hypercontractive inequalities for simple
operators where $t$ is known to depend not only on $p$ and $q$ but also on the
underlying space.
  The new reverse hypercontractive inequalities established here imply new
mixing and isoperimetric results for short random walks in product spaces, for
certain card-shufflings, for Glauber dynamics in high-temperatures spin systems
as well as for queueing processes. The inequalities further imply a
quantitative Arrow impossibility theorem for general product distributions and
inverse polynomial bounds in the number of players for the non-interactive
correlation distillation problem with $m$-sided dice.

in 2003. The source displayed a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of Lq ~ 1E33
(D/5.5kpc)^2 erg/s, which was completely dominated by hard non-thermal
emission. This is at odds with other non-pulsating neutron stars that typically
show detectable soft thermal emission at such quiescent luminosities. Here, we
use three additional Chandra observations, performed in 2009 and 2011, to
further study the quiescent properties of EXO 1745-248. We find that the
powerlaw intensity varies considerably up to a factor of ~3 within hours and by
about one order of magnitude between the different epochs. We discuss the
implications of the observed change in quiescent flux for the interpretation of
the hard powerlaw emission. Furthermore, we constrain the neutron star surface
temperature as seen by a distant observer to kT_inf < 42 eV and the thermal
bolometric luminosity to Lq,bol < 7E31 (D/5.5kpc)^2 erg/s. This confirms that
EXO 1745-248 harbours a relatively cold neutron star and suggests that, for
example, enhanced cooling mechanisms are operating in the stellar core, or that
the binary on average resides in quiescence for hundreds of years.

67 day eruption, for an average of one measure every 2.6 minutes. This unique
and unprecedented coverage is the first time that a nova has any substantial
amount of fast photometry. With this, two new phenomena have been discovered:
the fast flares in the early light curve seen from days 9-15 (which have no
proposed explanation) and the optical dips seen out of eclipse from days 41-61
(likely caused by raised rims of the accretion disk occulting the bright inner
regions of the disk as seen over specific orbital phases). The expanding shell
and wind cleared enough from days 12-15 so that the inner binary system became
visible, resulting in the sudden onset of eclipses and the turn-on of the
supersoft X-ray source. On day 15, a strong asymmetry in the out-of-eclipse
light points to the existence of the accretion stream. The normal optical
flickering restarts on day 24.5. For days 15-26, eclipse mapping shows that the
optical source is spherically symmetric with a radius of 4.1 R_sun. For days
26-41, the optical light is coming from a rim-bright disk of radius 3.4 R_sun.
For days 41-67, the optical source is a center-bright disk of radius 2.2 R_sun.
Throughout the eruption, the colors remain essentially constant. We present 12
eclipse times during eruption plus five just after the eruption.

designed to measure the orbital period change of recurrent novae (RNe) across
an eruption. The goal is to use the orbital period change to measure the mass
ejected during each eruption as the key part of trying to measure whether the
RNe white dwarfs are gaining or losing mass over an entire eruption cycle, and
hence whether they can be progenitors for Type Ia supernovae. This program has
now been completed for two eclipsing RNe; CI Aquilae (CI Aql) across its
eruption in 2000 and U Scorpii (U Sco) across its eruption in 1999. For CI Aql,
I present 78 eclipse times from 1991-2009 (including four during the tail of
the 2000 eruption) plus two eclipses from 1926 and 1935. For U Sco, I present
67 eclipse times, including 46 times during quiescence from 1989-2009, plus 21
eclipse times in the tails of the 1945, 1999, and 2010 eruptions. The eclipse
times during the tails of eruptions are systematically and substantially
shifted with respect to the ephemerides from the eclipses in quiescence, with
this being caused by shifts of the center of light during the eruption. These
eclipse times are plotted on an O-C diagram and fitted to models with a steady
period change (Pdot) between eruptions (caused by, for example, conservative
mass transfer) plus an abrupt period change (DeltaP) at the time of eruption.
For CI Aql, the best fit is DeltaP=-3.7^{+9.2}_{-7.3} X 10^{-7}. For U Sco, the
best fit is DeltaP=(+43+-69) X 10^{-7} days. These period changes can directly
give a dynamical measure of the mass ejected (M_ejecta) during each eruption
with negligible sensitivity to the stellar masses and no uncertainty from
distances. For CI Aql, the one-sigma upper limit is M_ejecta < 10 X 10^{-7}$
M_sun. For U Sco, I derive M_ejecta=(43+-67) X 10^{-7} M_sun.

significance to the fact that experiments and calculations can both be
performed with a high accuracy. In this review, both theoretical and

results will be presented. The discussion on the effects of the three-nucleon

at least 1989. However, despite its popularity and wide usage, database vendors
provide only limited indexing support for regular expression queries which
almost always require a full table scan.
  In this paper we propose a rigorous and robust approach for providing
indexing support for regular expression queries. Our approach consists of
formulating the indexing problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. We
begin with a database, abstracted as a collection of strings. From this data
set we generate a query workload. The input to the optimization problem is the
database and the workload. The output is a set of multigrams (substrings) which
can be used as keys to records which satisfy the query workload. The multigrams
can then be integrated with the data structure (like B+ trees) to provide
indexing support for the queries. We provide a deterministic and a randomized
approximation algorithm (with provable guarantees) to solve the optimization
problem. Extensive experiments on synthetic data sets demonstrate that our
approach is accurate and efficient.
  We also present a case study on PROSITE patterns - which are complex regular
expression signatures for classes of proteins. Again, we are able to
demonstrate the utility of our indexing approach in terms of accuracy and
efficiency. Thus, perhaps for the first time, there is a robust and practical
indexing mechanism for an important class of database queries.

also briefly discuss the issue of singularities in order to avoid impossible

relative equilibria, which follow naturally from the geometric properties of
${\mathbb S}_\kappa^3$ and ${\mathbb H}_\kappa^3$. Then we prove several
criteria, each expressing the conditions for the existence of a certain class
of relative equilibria, some of which have a simple rotation, whereas others
perform a double rotation, and we describe their qualitative behaviour. In
particular, we show that in ${\mathbb S}_\kappa^3$ the bodies move either on
circles or on Clifford tori, whereas in ${\mathbb H}_\kappa^3$ they move either
on circles or on hyperbolic cylinders. Then we construct concrete examples for
each class of relative equilibria previously described, thus proving that these
classes are not empty. We put into the evidence some surprising orbits, such as
those for which a group of bodies stays fixed on a great circle of a great
sphere of ${\mathbb S}_\kappa^3$, while the other bodies rotate uniformly on a
complementary great circle of another great sphere, as well as a large class of
quasiperiodic relative equilibria, the first such non-periodic orbits ever

research directions and the future perspectives in the light of the results we

Narrow-band interference filters can be tuned toward shorter
wavelengths by tilting them from the perpendicular to the optical axis. This
can be used as a cheap alternative to real tunable filters, such as
Fabry-P\'erot interferometers and Lyot filters. At the Swedish 1-m Solar
Telescope, such a setup is used to scan through the blue wing of the Ca II H
line. Because the filter is mounted in a converging beam, the incident angle
varies over the pupil, which causes a variation of the transmission over the
pupil, different for each wavelength within the passband. This causes
broadening of the filter transmission profile and degradation of the image
quality. Aims. We want to characterize the properties of our filter, at normal
incidence as well as at different tilt angles. Knowing the broadened profile is
important for the interpretation of the solar images. Compensating the images
for the degrading effects will improve the resolution and remove one source of
image contrast degradation. In particular, we need to solve the latter problem
for images that are also compensated for blurring caused by atmospheric
turbulence. Methods. We simulate the process of image formation through a
tilted interference filter in order to understand the effects. We test the
hypothesis that they are separable from the effects of wavefront aberrations
for the purpose of image deconvolution. We measure the filter transmission
profile and the degrading PSF from calibration data. Results. We find that the
filter transmission profile differs significantly from the specifications.We
demonstrate how to compensate for the image-degrading effects. Because the
filter tilt effects indeed appear to be separable from wavefront aberrations in
a useful way, this can be done in a final deconvolution, after standard image
restoration with MFBD/Phase Diversity based methods. We illustrate the
technique with real data.

addition, with the detailed balance condition softly breaking, the number of
independent coupling constants can be significantly reduced (from more than 70

limit, whereby the prediction powers of the theory are considerably improved.
The strong coupling problem in the matter sector can be cured by introducing an
energy scale $M_{*}$, so that $M_{*} < \Lambda_{\omega}$, where $M_{*}$ denotes
the suppression energy of high order derivative terms, and $\Lambda_{\omega}$

signed latitudes, respectively. We repeat the analysis with subsets which are
divided based on the criterion of which hemisphere is dominant for a given
solar cycle. Our primary findings are as follows: (1) COL is not monotonically
decreasing with time in each cycle. Small humps can be seen (or short plateaus)
around every solar maxima. (2) The distribution of COL resulting from each
hemisphere is bimodal, which can well be represented by the double Gaussian
function. (3) As far as the primary component of the double Gaussian function
is concerned, for a given data subset, the distributions due to the sunspots
appearing in two different hemispheres are alike. Regardless of which
hemisphere is magnetically dominant, the primary component of the double
Gaussian function seems relatively unchanged. (4) When the northern (southern)
hemisphere is dominant the width of the secondary component of the double
Gaussian function in the northern (southern) hemisphere case is about twice as
wide as that in the southern (northern) hemisphere. (5) For the distribution of
the COL averaged with signed latitude, whose distribution is basically
described by a single Gaussian function, it is shifted to the positive

fluctuation of high energy muons themselves but also the fluctuation of the
various quantities related to the energy losses by the muons, which are
difficult to obtain by the v_{cut} procedure. Namely, we obtain the fluctuation
on energy losses of muons in the present paper(Part1). In a subsequent paper
(Part2), based on the idea developed in Part1, we will examine the correlation
between the primary energies of muons and their energy deposits and the
correlation between the energy deposits of the muons concerned and their

simultaneously measure both [\ion{O}{3}] line profile and circumnuclear stellar
population in individual spectrum, a large sample of narrow emission-line
galaxies is selected from the MPA/JHU SDSS DR7 catalog. By requiring that 1)
the [\ion{O}{3}] line signal-to-noise ratio is larger than 30, 2) the
[\ion{O}{3}] line width is larger than the instrumental resolution by a factor
of 2, our sample finally contains 2,333 Seyfert galaxies/LINERs (AGNs), 793
transition galaxies, and 190 starforming galaxies. In additional to the
commonly used profile parameters (i.e., line centroid, relative velocity shift
and velocity dispersion), two dimensionless shape parameters, skewness and
kurtosis, are used to quantify the line shape deviation from a pure Gaussian
function. We show that the transition galaxies are systematically associated
with narrower line widths and weaker [\ion{O}{3}] broad wings than the AGNs,
which implies that the kinematics of the emission-line gas is different in the
two kinds of objects. By combining the measured host properties and line shape
parameters, we find that the AGNs with stronger blue asymmetries tend to be
associated with younger stellar populations. However, the similar trend is not
identified in the transition galaxies. The failure is likely resulted from a
selection effect in which the transition galaxies are systematically associated
with younger stellar populations than the AGNs. The evolutionary significance
revealed here suggests that both NLR kinematics and outflow feedback in AGNs
co-evolve with their host galaxies.

reveal the formation of three of these eddies at the southern tip of the Grand
Banks (42 N, 50 W). Using a recently developed method to detect eddies in float
trajectories and estimate their kinematic properties, it was found that the
eddies had average rotation periods of 5--7 days at radii of 1025 km, with mean
rotation speeds of up to 0.3 m/s. One especially long-lived (5.1 months) eddy
crossed under the Gulf Stream path and translated southwestward in the
subtropical recirculation to at least 35 N, where it hit one of the Corner Rise
Seamounts. Velocity, temperature and salinity measurements from a nine-month

their formation at intermediate levels of the Labrador Current south of the

heterostructure. A wire defined simultaneously in the lower well probes the
ability of the upper wire to screen the electric field from a biased surface
gate. The technique is sensitive enough to resolve spin-splitting of the
subbands in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We measure a
compressibility signal due to the 0.7 structure and study its evolution with
increasing temperature and magnetic field. We see no evidence of the formation
of the quasibound state predicted by the Kondo model, instead our data are
consistent with theories which predict that the 0.7 structure arises as a
result of spontaneous spin polarization.

ill-posedness for the Cauchy problem of the linearized Prandtl equation around

formation. Basic physical properties of the evolving dust aggregates strongly
depend on the porosity of the aggregates, e.g. mechanical strength, thermal
conductivity, gas-grain coupling time. Also the outcome of further collisions
depends on the porosity of the colliding aggregates. In laboratory experiments
we study the growth of large aggregates of $\sim$ 3 mm to 3 cm through
continuous impacts of small dust agglomerates of 100 $\mu$m size, consisting of
$\mu$m grains at different impact velocities. The experiments show that
agglomerates grow by direct sticking as well as gravitational reaccretion. The
latter can be regarded as suitable analog to reaccretion of fragments by gas
drag in protoplanetary disks. Experiments were carried out in the velocity
range between 1.5 m/s and 7 m/s. With increasing impact velocities the volume
filling factor of the resulting agglomerates increases from $\phi = 0.2$ for
1.5 m/s to $\phi = 0.32$ for 7 m/s. These values are independent of the target
size. Extrapolation of the measured velocity dependence of the volume filling
factor implies that higher collision velocities will not lead to more compact
aggregates. Therefore, $\phi = 0.32$ marks a degree of compaction suitable to
describe structures forming at $\rm v > 6\, m/s$. At small collision velocities
below 1 m/s highly porous structures with $\phi \approx 0.10$ will form. For
intermediate collision velocities porosities vary. Depending on the disk model
and resulting relative velocities, objects in protoplanetary disks up to
dm-size might evolve from highly porous ($\phi \approx 0.10$) to compact ($\phi
= 0.32$) with a more complex intermediate size range of varying porosity.

with a range of dependences on temperature affect the stability of interstellar
gas. For about four and a half decades, astrophysicists have recognised the
importance of the thermal instablity for the formation of clouds in the
interstellar medium. Even in the past several years, many papers have concerned
the role of the thermal instability in the production of molecular clouds.
About three and a half decades ago, astrophysicists investigating radiative
shocks noticed that for many cooling laws such shocks are unstable. Attempts to
address the effects of cosmic rays on the stablity of radiative media that are
initially uniform or that have just passed through shocks have been made. The
simplest approach to such studies involves the assumption that the cosmic rays
behave as a fluid. Work based on such an approach is described. Cosmic rays
have no effect on the stability of initially uniform, static media with respect
to isobaric perturbations, though they do affect the stability of such media
with respect to isentropic perturbations. The effect of cosmic rays on the
stability of radiative shocked media depends greatly on the efficiency of the
conversion of energy in accelerated cosmic rays into thermal energy in the
thermalized fluid. If that efficiency is low, radiative cooling makes weak
shocks propagating into upstream media with low cosmic-ray pressures more
likely to be cosmic-ray dominated than adiabatic shocks of comparable strength.
The cosmic-ray dominated shocks do not display radiative overstability. Highly
efficient conversion of cosmic-ray energy into thermal energy leads shocked
media to behave as they do when cosmic rays are absent.

quantities in the case of peristaltic transport of the blood in a channel are
much different from those for flow in an axisymmetric vessel of circular

the cross-sectional radius of blood vessels of the micro-circulatory system.

this P depends on the temperature and its gradient, the scattering properties

hard to obtain: it immediately confirms the presence of clouds, and P can then
constrain atmospheric inhomogeneities and the flattening due to the planet's
rotation rate. For zonally symmetric planets, the angle of polarization will
yield the components of the planet's spin axis normal to the line-of-sight.
Finally, our simulations show that P is generally more sensitive to variability
in a cloudy planet's atmosphere than the thermal flux is, and could hence
better reveal certain dynamical processes.

magnetic properties have been investigated on well oriented single crystals by
measuring the magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and heat
capacity. It has been found that CeGe orders antiferromagnetically at 10.5 K.
Both transport and magnetic studies have revealed large anisotropy reflecting
the orthorhombic crystal structure. The magnetization measurement measured at 2
K revealed metamagnetic transitions along the [010] direction at 4.8 and 6.4 T
and along [100] direction at a critical field of 10.7 T, while the
magnetiztaion along [001] direction was increasing linearly without any anomaly
up to a field of 16 T. From the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization
measurements it has been found that [010] direction is the easy axis of
magnetization. The electrical resistivity along the three crystallographic
directions exhibited an upturn at $T_{\rm N}$ indicating the superzone gap
formation below $T_{\rm N}$ in this compound. We have performed the crystalline
electric field (CEF) analysis on the magnetic susceptibility and the heat
capacity data and found that the ground state is doublet and the splitting
energies from the ground state to the first and second excited doublet states
were estimated to be 39 and 111 K, respectively.

D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.86.043011",,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The advanced world-wide network of gravitational waves (GW) observatories is
scheduled to begin operations within the current decade. Thanks to their
improved sensitivity, they promise to yield a number of detections and thus to
open a new observational windows for astronomy and astrophysics. Among the
scientific goals that should be achieved, there is the independent measurement
of the value of the cosmological parameters, hence an independent test of the
current cosmological paradigm. Due to the importance of such task, a number of
studies have evaluated the capabilities of GW telescopes in this respect.
However, since GW do not yield information about the source redshift, different
groups have made different assumptions regarding the means through which the GW
redshift can be obtained. These different assumptions imply also different
methodologies to solve this inference problem. This work presents a formalism
based on Bayesian inference developed to facilitate the inclusion of all
assumptions and prior information about a GW source within a single data
analysis framework. This approach guarantees the minimisation of information
loss and the possibility of including naturally event-specific knowledge (such
as the sky position for a Gamma Ray Burst - GW coincident observation) in the
analysis. The workings of the method are applied to a specific example, loosely
designed along the lines of the method proposed by Schutz in 1986, in which one
uses information from wide-field galaxy surveys as prior information for the
location of a GW source. I show that combining the results from few tens of
observations from a network of advanced interferometers will constrain the
Hubble constant $H_0$ to an accuracy of $\sim 4 - 5$% at 95% confidence.

diffusion theory alone. Both mass loss and turbulence have been invoked to slow
down atomic diffusion in order to match observed abundances. The fact that some
sdB stars show pulsations gives upper limits on the amount of mass loss and
turbulent mixing allowed. Consequently, non-adiabatic asteroseismology has the
potential to decide which process is responsible for the abundance anomalies.
We compute for the first time seismic properties of sdB models with atomic
diffusion included consistently during the stellar evolution. The diffusion
equations with radiative forces are solved for H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Fe and
Ni. We examine the effects of various mass-loss rates and mixed surface masses
on the abundances and mode stability. It is shown that the mass-loss rates
needed to simulate the observed He abundances (10^{-14}<=Mdot
[Msun/yr]<=10^{-13}) are not consistent with observed pulsations. We find that
for pulsations to be driven the rates should be Mdot<=10^{-15} Msun/yr. On the
other hand, weak turbulent mixing of the outer 10^{-6} Msun can explain the He
abundance anomalies while still allowing pulsations to be driven. The origin of
the turbulence remains unknown but the presence of pulsations gives tight
constraints on the underlying turbulence model.

bombarding energies far below the Coulomb barrier. This effect is shown its
worth in the dependence of mean-square angular momentum on the bombarding

allocation protocol for standalone MANETs is specified and evaluated within
NS2. Our solution is based on mutual authentication, and a fully distributed
Autoconfiguration and CA model, in conjunction with threshold cryptography. By

of concurrent traffic flows (NCTF) increases over a single common control
channel, as it is for most conventional networks. To alleviate this problem,
this paper proposes a two-stage coordination multi-radio multi-channel MAC
(TSC-M2MAC) protocol that designates all available channels as both control
channels and data channels in a time division manner through a two-stage
coordination. At the first stage, a load balancing breadth-first-search-based
vertex coloring algorithm for multi-radio conflict graph is proposed to
intelligently allocate multiple control channels. At the second stage, a
REQ/ACK/RES mechanism is proposed to realize dynamical channel allocation for
data transmission. At this stage, the Channel-and-Radio Utilization Structure
(CRUS) maintained by each node is able to alleviate the hidden nodes problem;
also, the proposed adaptive adjustment algorithm for the Channel Negotiation
and Allocation (CNA) sub-interval is able to cope with the variation of NCTF.
In addition, we design a power saving mechanism for the TSC-M2MAC to decrease
its energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol is
able to achieve higher throughput and lower end-to-end packet delay than
conventional schemes. They also show that the TSC-M2MAC can achieve load
balancing, save energy, and remain stable when the network becomes saturated.

pollution attack, in which attackers aggressively inject polluted contents into
the systems to reduce the availability of authentic contents, thus decreasing
the confidence of participating users.
  In this paper, we design a pollution-free P2P content sharing system, Green,
by exploiting the inherent content-based information and the social-based
reputation. In Green, a content provider (i.e., creator or sharer) publishes
the information of his shared contents to a group of content maintainers
self-organized in a security overlay for providing the mechanisms of redundancy
and reliability, so that a content requestor can obtain and filter the
information of his requested content from the associated maintainers. We employ
a reputation model to help the requestor better identify the polluted contents,
and then utilize the social (friend-related) information to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency of our reputation model. Now, the requestor could
easily select an authentic content version for downloading. While downloading,
each requestor performs a realtime integrity verification and takes prompt
protection to handle the content pollution. To further improve the system
performance, we devise a scalable probabilistic verification scheme.
  Green is broadly applicable for both structured and unstructured overlay
applications, and moreover, it is able to defeat various kinds of content
pollution attacks without incurring significant overhead on the participating
users. The evaluation in massive-scale networks validates the success of Green
against the content pollution.

emphasize the role of non-local radiative transfer effects that often are not
taken into account, for example, when modelling the core chemistry. These
include the radiative coupling between regions of different temperature and the
enhanced line cooling near the cloud surface. The uncertainty of the
temperature profiles does not necessarily translate to a significant error in
the column density derived from observations. However, depletion processes are
very temperature sensitive and a two degree difference can mean that a given

forward folding technique is used to determine the best-fit parameters for a

The best-fit parameters are estimated using a maximum-likelihood method with
simulated light curves in conjunction with the Lomb Scargle Periodogram (LSP)
and the first-order Structure Function (SF). In addition, a new approach based
upon the so-called Multiple Fragments Variance Function (MFVF) is introduced
and compared to the other methods. Simulated light curves have been used to
confirm the reliability of these methods as well as to estimate the
uncertainties of the best-fit parameters. Results: The light curve is
consistent with the assumed broken power-law PSD. All three methods agree
within the estimated uncertainties with the MFVF providing the most accurate
results. The red-noise behaviour of the PSD in frequency f follows a power law
with f^-{\beta}, {\beta}=1.8 +0.1/-0.2 and a break towards f^0 at frequencies

are believed to be some of the oldest galaxy systems in the universe. They have
therefore been the subject of much recent research.
  In this work we present a study of 10 fossil group candidates with an average
of 33 spectroscopically confirmed members per group, making this the deepest
study of its type to-date. We also use this data to perform an analysis of the
luminosity function of our sample of fossil groups.
  We confirm the high masses previously reported for many of fossil systems,
finding values more similar to those of clusters than of groups. We also
confirm the high dynamical mass-to-light ratios reported in many previous
studies. While our results are consistent with previous studies in many ways,
our interpretation is not. This is because we show that, while the luminosities
of the BCGs in these systems are consistent with their high dynamical masses,
their richnesses (total number of galaxies above some canonical value) are
extremely low. This leads us to suggest a new interpretation of fossil systems
in which the large differences between the luminosities of their brightest and
second brightest galaxies are simply the result the high BCG luminosities and
low richnesses, while the high masses and low richnesses also explain the high
mass-to-light ratios. Our results therefore suggest that fossil systems can be
characterised as cluster-like in their masses and BCG luminosities, but
possessing the richnesses and optical luminosities of relatively poor groups.
These findings are not predicted by any of the current models for the formation
of fossil groups. Therefore, if this picture is confirmed, current ideas about
the formation and evolution of fossil systems will need to be reformulated.

P2P hosts' connection patterns and traffic volume in an attempt to detect
active P2P worm attacks. Once detected, local isolation, alert propagation and
software patching will take place for containment. The Phagocytes further
provide the access control and filtering mechanisms for communication
establishment between the internal P2P overlay and the external hosts. We
design a novel adaptive and interaction-based computational puzzle scheme at
the Phagocytes to restrain external worms attacking the P2P overlay, without

represent the speed of the movement of the centers. In the slow stage, the

small size of the training data chosen. The time cost of the distance
calculation for the slow stage is also minimized due to small number of

crossover of a one-dimensional bosonic system from weak to strong interactions
in a harmonic trap. The explicit wave function, which is based on the exact
two-body states, consists of symmetric multiple products of the corresponding
parabolic cylinder functions, and respects the analytically known limits of
zero and infinite repulsion for arbitrary number of particles. For intermediate
interaction strengths we demonstrate, that the energies, as well as the reduced
densities of first and second order, are in excellent agreement with large
scale numerical calculations.

number of one-dimensional spinless free fermions on a segment of a given
length. The generating function for this probability distribution can be
expressed as a determinant of a Toeplitz matrix. We use the recently proven
generalized Fisher--Hartwig conjecture on the asymptotic behavior of such
determinants to find the generating function for the full counting statistics
of fermions on a line segment. Unlike the method of bosonization, the
Fisher--Hartwig formula correctly takes into account the discreteness of
charge. Furthermore, we check numerically the precision of the generalized
Fisher--Hartwig formula, find that it has a higher precision than rigorously
proven so far, and conjecture the form of the next-order correction to the
existing formula.

selfcoupling constants in the Higgs potential come only from the D-terms at the
tree level. We investigate the decoupling property of additional two heavier
Higgs doublet fields in the supersymmetric standard model with four Higgs
doublets. In particular, we study how they can modify the predictions on the
quantities well predicted in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM),
when the extra doublet fields are rather heavy to be measured at collider
experiments. The B-term mixing between these extra heavy Higgs bosons and the
relatively light MSSM-like Higgs bosons can significantly change the
predictions in the MSSM such as on the masses of MSSM-like Higgs bosons as well
as the mixing angle for the two light CP-even scalar states. We first give
formulae for deviations in the observables of the MSSM in the decoupling region
for the extra two doublet fields. We then examine possible deviations in the
Higgs sector numerically, and discuss their phenomenological implications.
