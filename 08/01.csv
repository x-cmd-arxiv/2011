services. The buffer is modeled as an M/M/1 queue, plus the consideration of
bursty arrivals. When the buffer is empty, the service restarts after a certain
amount of packets are \emph{prefetched}. With this goal, we propose two
approaches to obtain the \emph{exact distribution} of the number of buffer
starvations, one of which is based on \emph{Ballot theorem}, and the other uses
recursive equations. The Ballot theorem approach gives an explicit result. We
extend this approach to the scenario with a constant playback rate using
T\`{a}kacs Ballot theorem. The recursive approach, though not offering an
explicit result, can obtain the distribution of starvations with
non-independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) arrival process in which
an ON/OFF bursty arrival process is considered in this work. We further compute
the starvation probability as a function of the amount of prefetched packets
for a large number of files via a fluid analysis. Among many potential
applications of starvation analysis, we show how to apply it to optimize the
objective quality of experience (QoE) of media streaming, by exploiting the
tradeoff between startup/rebuffering delay and starvations.

LaRhSi$_{3}$ crystallizes with the BaNiSn$_{3}$-type tetragonal structure
(space group \textit{I4 mm}) as confirmed through our neutron diffraction
study. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and specific heat data
reveal a sharp and well defined superconducting transition at $T_{c}$ = 2.16

is a weakly coupled bulk BCS superconductor and has an s-wave singlet ground
state with an isotropic energy gap of $\sim$ 0.3 meV, $2 \Delta_{0}
/k_{B}T_{c}$ = 3.24. The specific heat data measured in applied magnetic field
strongly indicate a type-I behaviour. Type-I superconductivity in this compound
is also inferred from the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, $\kappa$ = 0.25. Various
superconducting parameters, including the electron-phonon coupling strength,
penetration depth and coherence length, characterize LaRhSi$_{3}$ as a moderate
dirty-limit superconductor. A detailed study of the magnetic field-temperature
($H-T$) phase diagram is presented and from a consideration of the free energy,
the thermodynamic critical field, $H_{c0}$ is estimated to be 17.1 $\pm$ 0.1
mT, which is in very good agreement with that estimated from the transverse
field $\mu$SR measurement that gives $H_{c0}$ = 17.2 $\pm$ 0.1 mT. The
transverse field $\mu$SR results are consistent with conventional type-I
superconductivity in this compound. Further, the zero-field $\mu$SR results
indicate that time reversal symmetry is preserved when entering the

channel. Some nodes have a rechargeable battery and the others are plugged to a
reliable power supply and, thus, have no energy limitations. We consider two
source-destination pairs and apply the concept of cognitive radio communication
in sharing the common channel. Specifically, we give high-priority to the
energy-constrained source-destination pair, i.e., primary pair, and
low-priority to the pair which is free from such constraint, i.e., secondary
pair. In contrast to the traditional notion of cognitive radio, in which the
secondary transmitter is required to relinquish the channel as soon as the
primary is detected, the secondary transmitter not only utilizes the idle slots
of primary pair but also transmits along with the primary transmitter with
probability $p$. This is possible because we consider the general multi-packet
reception model. Given the requirement on the primary pair's throughput, the
probability $p$ is chosen to maximize the secondary pair's throughput. To this
end, we obtain two-dimensional maximum stable throughput region which describes
the theoretical limit on rates that we can push into the network while
maintaining the queues in the network to be stable. The result is obtained for
both cases in which the capacity of the battery at the primary node is infinite
and also finite.

we evaluate the electromagnetic field Green tensor on the imaginary frequency

case of anisotropic polarizability. In dependence of the eigenvalues for the
polarizability tensor and of the orientation of its principal axes, the
Casimir-Polder force can be either repulsive or attractive. Moreover, there are
situations where the force changes the sign with separation. We show that for
an isotropic polarizability tensor the force is always repulsive. At large
separations between the microparticle and the string, the force varies
inversely as the fifth power of the distance. In the non-retarded regime,
corresponding to separations smaller than the relevant transition wavelengths,
the force decays as the inverse fourth power of the distance. In the case of
anisotropic polarizability, the dependence of the Casimir-Polder potential on
the orientation of the polarizability tensor principal axes also leads to the
moment of force acting on the particle.

that simplify analysis. It is important to know how restrictive this class of
functions is, for instance for the purpose of network reverse-engineering. This
paper contains a formula for the number of such functions and a comparison to
the class of all functions. In particular, it is shown that, as the number of
variables becomes large, the ratio of the number of nested canalyzing functions
to the number of all functions converges to zero. This shows that the class of
nested canalyzing functions is indeed very restrictive, indicating that
molecular networks have very special properties. The principal tool used for
this investigation is a description of these functions as polynomials and a
parameterization of the class of all such polynomials in terms of relations on
their coefficients.

present some examples of how our results can be applied to astrophysical
contexts. First, we show how our formulae, in conjunction with current
gravitational wave (non-)detections of the Crab pulsar and the Cassiopeia A
central compact object (Cas A CCO), can be used to constrain the strength of
the internal toroidal fields of those objects. We find that, for the Crab
pulsar (whose canonical equatorial dipole field strength, inferred from spin
down, is $4\times 10^8$ T) to emit detectable gravitational radiation, the
neutron star must have a strong toroidal field component, with maximum internal
toroidal field strength $B_{\mathrm{tm}}=7\times 10^{12}$ T; for gravitational
waves to be detected from the Cas A CCO at 300 Hz, $B_{\mathrm{tm}}\sim
10^{13}$ T, whereas detection at 100 Hz would require $B_{\mathrm{tm}}\sim
10^{14}$ T. Using our results, we also show how the gravitational wave signal
emitted by a magnetar immediately after its birth (assuming it is born rapidly

most of their lifetime at an intermediate level luminosity $\sim

adopted, the resulting radii of the emission region are always only a few
hundred meters, supporting the idea that during the intermediate state SFXTs
are accreting matter from the companion star. From these observational
phenomena we derive possible constraints on the magnetic field strengths of the
neutron stars in four SFXTs with known spin periods. While IGR J11215$-$5952,
IGR J16465$-$4507, and IGR J18483$-$0311 may have magnetic fields (up to a few
$10^{11}-10^{12}$ G) similar to those of normal X-ray pulsars, the magnetic
field of AX J1841.0$-$0536 is considerably low ($\la 10^{10}$ G). The high-mass
companion stars in SFXTs implies that the neutron stars are relatively young
objects, with age less than $\sim 10^7$ yr. Analysis of the spin evolution
shows that neutron stars like AX J1841.0$-$0536 should be born with relatively
long spin periods ($\la 1$ s). Considering the fact that among the four SFXTs
only AX J1841.0$-$0536 is a ""proper"" one, and the other three are either
""intermediate"" SFXTs or have peculiar characteristics, we suggest that the
neutron stars in some of SFXTs may have similar characteristics as several
young central compact objects in supernova remnants called ""anti-magnetars"".
These features, combining with accretion from clumpy winds, could make them
distinct from standard supergiant X-ray binaries -- the low fields and
relatively long spin periods guarantee accretion at very low level, resulting
in a large dynamic range ($10^4-10^5$) of X-ray luminosity.

parameters of timed Rebeca models, which represent the environment and
component variables, and use McErlang to run multiple simulations for different

internalised in a process calculus. An operational semantics for the calculus
specifies how queries, data and processes interact. A labelled transition

Bisimulation over the labelled transition system is used to verify an algebra

two processes based on their possible conflicts in combination with other

conflict preorder by introducing less conflicting pairs as a concrete

such as alcohol and other drug use (AOD) and depression. Group therapy is often
delivered under a rolling (or open) admissions policy, where new clients are
continuously enrolled into a group as space permits. Rolling admissions
policies result in a complex correlation structure among client outcomes.
Despite the ubiquity of rolling admissions in practice, little guidance on the
analysis of such data is available. We discuss the limitations of previously
proposed approaches in the context of a study that delivered group cognitive
behavioral therapy for depression to clients in residential substance abuse
treatment. We improve upon previous rolling group analytic approaches by fully
modeling the interrelatedness of client depressive symptom scores using a
hierarchical Bayesian model that assumes a conditionally autoregressive prior
for session-level random effects. We demonstrate improved performance using our
method for estimating the variance of model parameters and the enhanced ability
to learn about the complex correlation structure among participants in rolling
therapy groups. Our approach broadly applies to any group therapy setting where
groups have changing client composition. It will lead to more efficient
analyses of client-level data and improve the group therapy research
community's ability to understand how the dynamics of rolling groups lead to
client outcomes.

internal structure of the hadron. An understanding of the form factors is
necessary to describe the strong interactions as they are sensitive to the pion
cloud and provide a test for the QCD inspired effective field theories based on
the chiral symmetry. In view of the very exciting recent developments in the
field, we propose to apply the techniques of chiral constituent quark model to
measure the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon.The results obtained
are comparable to the latest experimental studies and also show improvement
over some theoretical interpretations.

integrated, distributed brain systems and networks, whose different regions
need to work in unison for normal functioning.
  The EEG is a non-invasive technique that can provide information for massive
connectivity analyses. Cortical signals of time varying electric neuronal
activity can be estimated from the EEG. Although such techniques have very high
time resolution, two cortical signals even at distant locations will appear to
be highly similar due to the low spatial resolution nature of the EEG.
  In this study a method for eliminating the effect of common sources due to
low spatial resolution is presented. It is based on an efficient estimation of
the whole-cortex partial coherence matrix. Using as a starting point any linear
EEG tomography that satisfies the EEG forward equation, it is shown that the
generalized partial coherences for the cortical grey matter current density
time series are invariant to the selected tomography. It is empirically shown
with simulation experiments that the generalized partial coherences have higher
spatial resolution than the classical coherences. The results demonstrate that
with as little as 19 electrodes, lag-connected brain regions can often be
missed and misplaced even with lagged coherence measures, while the new method
detects and localizes correctly the connected regions using the lagged partial
coherences.

We show that the corresponding dynamics may lead to a steady-state, divergence
in a finite time as well as the formation of spatiotemporal irregular patterns.
The latter, in particular, appear to be chaotic in part of the range of bounded
solutions, as demonstrated by the analysis of wavelet power spectra. Steady
states are achieved with sufficiently large values of the chemotactic

For $r > r_c$, the solutions of the differential equations of the model diverge

is present around 0.5 eV in all materials, which is mostly created by 5$f$
electrons. These fluctuations couple to the single-particle spectrum and give
rise to a peak-dip-hump feature, characteristic of the coexistence of itinerant
and localized electronic states. Results are in quantitative agreement with
photoemission spectra. Finally, we show that the studied actinides can be
understood within the rigid-band filling approach, in which the
spin-fluctuation coupling constant follows the same materials dependence as the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$.

novel disordered phases. We analyze the order parameters in all phases and
identify situations where SO entanglement is crucial and factorization of the

SO entanglement may play a role in a bilayer fluoride K$_3$Cu$_2$F$_7$ which is

investigate the spin relaxation with random Rashba field induced by both
adatoms and substrate, by means of the kinetic spin Bloch equation approach.
The charged adatoms on one hand enhance the Rashba spin-orbit coupling locally
and on the other hand serve as Coulomb potential scatterers. Both effects
contribute to spin relaxation limited by the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. In
addition, the random Rashba field also causes spin relaxation by spin-flip
scattering, manifesting itself as an Elliott-Yafet--like mechanism. Both
mechanisms are sensitive to the correlation length of the random Rashba field,
which may be affected by the environmental parameters such as electron density
and temperature. By fitting and comparing the experiments from the Groningen
group [J\'ozsa {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 80}, 241403(R) (2009)] and

understanding of galaxy evolution from early times to the present. One of the
important parameters is the intrinsic, or local, velocity dispersion of a
galaxy, which allows one to quantify the degree of non-circular motions such as
pressure support. However, this is difficult to measure because the observed
dispersion includes the effects of (often severe) beam smearing on the velocity
gradient. Here we investigate four methods of measuring the dispersion that
have been used in the literature, to assess their effectiveness at recovering
the intrinsic dispersion. We discuss the biasses inherent in each method, and
apply them to model disk galaxies in order to determine which methods yield
meaningful quantities, and under what conditions. All the mean weighted
dispersion estimators are affected by (residual) beam smearing. In contrast,
the dispersion recovered by fitting a spatially and spectrally convolved disk
model to the data is unbiassed by the beam smearing it is trying to compensate.
Because of this, and because the bias it does exhibit depends only on the
signal-to-noise, it can be considered reliable. However, at very low
signal-to-noise, all methods should be used with caution.

first consider a collision between two test particles following the radial
geodesics in the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m naked singular geometry. An initially
radially ingoing particle turns back due to the repulsive effect of gravity in
the vicinity of naked singularity. Such a particle then collides with an
another radially ingoing particle. We show that the center of mass energy of
collision taking place at $r \approx M$ is unbound, in the limit where the
charge transcends the mass by arbitrarily small amount $0<1-M/Q\ll1$.The
acceleration process we described avoids fine tuning of the parameters of the
particle geodesics for the unbound center of mass energy of collisions and the
proper time required for the process is also finite. We show that the
coordinate time required for the trans-Plankian collision to occur around one
solar mass naked singularity is around million years while it is many orders of
magnitude larger than Hubble time in the black hole case. We then study the
collision of the neutral spherically symmetric shells made up of dust
particles. In this case, it is possible to treat the situation by exactly
taking into account the gravity due to the shells using Israel`s thin shell
formalism, and thus this treatment allows us to go beyond the test particle
approximation. The center of mass energy of collision of the shells is then
calculated in a situation analogous to the test particle case and is shown to
be bounded above. However, we find thatthe energy of a collision between two of
constituent particles of the shells at the center of mass frame can exceed the
Planck energy.

evidence of diffuse cluster-scale radio emission. The radio bi-modality has a
correspondence in terms of dynamical state of the hosting clusters showing that
merging clusters host radio halos and follow the well known radio--X-ray
correlation, while more relaxed clusters do not host radio halos and populate a
region well separated from that correlation. These evidences can be understood
in the framework of a scenario where merger-driven turbulence re-accelerate the
radio emitting electrons. We discuss the main statistical expectations of this
scenario underlining the important role of upcoming LOFAR surveys to test
present models.

study the problem of scaling up a sophisticated statistical inference framework

Lagrangian relaxation from mathematical programming to decompose a program into
smaller tasks while preserving the joint-inference property of the original

scalable joint inference for MLNs. We empirically validate that Felix is
significantly more scalable and efficient than prior approaches to MLN
inference by constructing a knowledge base from 1.8M documents as part of the
TAC challenge. We show that Felix scales and achieves state-of-the-art quality

Includes supplemental materials",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Respondent-Driven Sampling is a method to sample hard-to-reach human
populations by link-tracing over their social networks. Beginning with a
convenience sample, each person sampled is given a small number of uniquely
identified coupons to distribute to other members of the target population,
making them eligible for enrollment in the study. This can be an effective
means to collect large diverse samples from many populations.
  Inference from such data requires specialized techniques for two reasons.
Unlike in standard sampling designs, the sampling process is both partially
beyond the control of the researcher, and partially implicitly defined.
Therefore, it is not generally possible to directly compute the sampling
weights necessary for traditional design-based inference. Any likelihood-based
inference requires the modeling of the complex sampling process often beginning
with a convenience sample. We introduce a model-assisted approach, resulting in
a design-based estimator leveraging a working model for the structure of the
population over which sampling is conducted.
  We demonstrate that the new estimator has improved performance compared to
existing estimators and is able to adjust for the bias induced by the selection
of the initial sample. We present sensitivity analyses for unknown population
sizes and the misspecification of the working network model. We develop a
bootstrap procedure to compute measures of uncertainty. We apply the method to
the estimation of HIV prevalence in a population of injecting drug users (IDU)
in the Ukraine, and show how it can be extended to include application-specific
information.

considering, instead of the Wigner function, general constraints. We
demonstrate that, if, as usual in transport theories, the quasi-particle
distributions in electrodes are constrained, this method yields the completely

conclude that the variational approach itself is defective.

models. We have searched for linearly polarized radio emission associated with

We found no significant polarization within an aperture of $2^{\circ}$

environmental disturbances causing motion of the interferometer optics,

noise events have been identified by finding coincidence between noise in an
auxiliary data signal (with negligible sensitivity to gravitational waves) and
noise in the gravitational wave data, but attempts to include seismometer
readings in this scheme have proven ineffective. We present a new method of
generating a list of times of high seismic noise by tuning a gravitational wave
burst detection pipeline to the low frequency signature of these events. This

PACS and SPIRE photometric observations. These Herschel data are complemented
by unpublished observations by the Infrared Space Observatory Long Wavelength
Spectrometer (ISO LWS), which used parallel mode scans to obtain photometric
images of the region with a larger beam than Herschel but with a complementary
wavelength coverage and more frequent sampling with ten detectors observing at
ten different wavelengths in the range from 46 to 180 \mum, where the emission
peaks. We also include data from the MSX at 21.3 \mum for completeness. We
model the combined ISO LWS continuum plus Herschel PACS and SPIRE photometric
data toward the central 2 pc in Sgr A*, a region that includes the CND. We find
that the FIR spectral energy distribution is best represented by a continuum
that is the sum of three greybody curves from dust at temperatures of 90, 44.5,
and 23 K. We obtain temperature and molecular hydrogen column density maps of
the region. We estimate the mass of the inner part of the CND to be ~5.0x10e+4
Msum, with luminosities: Lcavity ~2.2x10e+6 Lsun and Lcnd ~1.5x10e+6 Lsun in
the central 2 pc radius around SgrA* . We find from the Herschel and ISO data
that the cold component of the dust dominates the total dust mass, with a
contribution of ~3.2x10E+4 Msun; this important cold material had escaped the
notice of earlier studies that relied on shorter wavelength observations. The
hotter component disagrees with some earlier estimates, but is consistent with
measured gas temperatures and with models that imply shock heating or turbulent
effects are at work. We find that the dust grain sizes apparently change widely
across the region, perhaps in response to the temperature variations, and we
map that distribution.

integrators with variable time steps, with rather disappointing results. In
this paper we identify the causes for this lack of performance, and find that
they fall into two categories. In the first, the time step is considered a
function of time alone, \Delta=\Delta(t). In this case, backwards error
analysis shows that while the algorithms remain symplectic, parametric
instabilities arise because of resonance between oscillations of \Delta(t) and
the orbital motion. In the second category the time step is a function of phase
space variables \Delta=\Delta(q,p). In this case, the system of equations to be
solved is analyzed by introducing a new time variable \tau with dt=\Delta(q,p)
d\tau. The transformed equations are no longer in Hamiltonian form, and thus
are not guaranteed to be stable even when integrated using a method which is
symplectic for constant \Delta. We analyze two methods for integrating the
transformed equations which do, however, preserve the structure of the original
equations. The first is an extended phase space method, which has been
successfully used in previous studies of adaptive time step symplectic
integrators. The second, novel, method is based on a non-canonical
mixed-variable generating function. Numerical trials for both of these methods
show good results, without parametric instabilities or spurious growth or
damping. It is then shown how to adapt the time step to an error estimate found
by backward error analysis, in order to optimize the time-stepping scheme.
Numerical results are obtained using this formulation and compared with other
time-stepping schemes for the extended phase space symplectic method.

without instability, enabling an order 10 decrease in required computational
resources compared to standard particle in cell (PIC) methods in 2D, with
another reduction of that order in 3D. Further advantage compared to PIC
methods accrues in regimes where particle noise is an issue. VMD and PIC
results in a 2D model of localized Langmuir waves are in qualitative agreement.

fuzzy-valued initial conditions are introduced, in order to obtain a shared
estimation of the state of a system based on partial and distributed
observations, in the case where such a state is affected by ambiguity and/or
vagueness. The Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems (DFS) are introduced as an extension
of scalar fuzzy difference equations and some conditions for their stability
and representation are provided. The proposed framework is then applied in the
field of Critical Infrastructures; the consensus framework is used to represent
a scenario where human operators, each able to observe directly the state of a
given infrastructure (or of a given area considering vast and geographically
dispersed infrastructures), reach an agreement on the overall situation, whose
severity is expressed in a linguistic, fuzzy way; conversely synchronization is
used to provide a distributed interdependency estimation system, where an array
of interdependency models is synchronized via partial observation.

double degenerate system (P=0.246137 d, K_1 = 288 km/s) comprising a fainter
white dwarf secondary with M_2 ~ 0.9 M_solar. Light curves phased with the
orbital ephemeris show evidence of relativistic beaming and weaker ellipsoidal
variations. The light curves also reveal secondary eclipses (depth ~ 8 mmag)
while the primary eclipses appear partially compensated by the secondary
gravitational deflection and are below detection limits. Photospheric abundance
measurements show a nearly solar composition of Si, Ca, and Fe (0.1-1 solar),
while the normal kinematics suggest a relatively recent formation history.
Close binary evolutionary scenarios suggest that extremely low mass white
dwarfs form via a common-envelope phase and possible Roche-lobe overflow.

cycling efficiency, resulting in lower capacity fade, than equivalent silicon
thin-film electrodes. We believe that copper appears to act as a glue that
binds the electrode together and prevents the electronic isolation of silicon
particles, thereby decreasing capacity loss. Rate capability decreases
significantly at higher copper-coating thicknesses as the silicon

the copper coating need to be optimized for enhanced capacity retention and

constant and uniform extra-acceleration A_Rin of Rindler type acts upon a test
particle p in the static field of a central mass M if certain conditions are
satisfied. Among other things, it was proposed as a potentially viable
explanation of a part of the Pioneer anomaly. We study the impact that an
anomalous Rindler-type term as large as |A_Rin| \sim 10^-10 m s^-2 may have on
the the orbital dynamics of a typical object of the Oort cloud whose
self-energy is quite smaller than its putative Rindler energy. By taking a
typical comet moving along a highly eccentric and inclined orbit throughout the
expected entire extension of the Oort cloud (0.02 pc-1 pc), it turns out that
the addition of an outward Rindler-like acceleration, i.e. for A_Rin > 0, does
not allow bound orbits. Instead, if A_Rin < 0, the resulting numerically
integrated trajectory is limited in space, but it radically differs from the
standard Keplerian ellipse. In particular, the heliocentric distance of the
comet gets markedly reduced and experiences high frequency oscillations, its
speed is increased, and the overall pattern of the trajectory is quite
isotropic. As a consequence, the standard picture of the Oort cloud is
radically altered since its modified orbits are much less sensitive to the
disturbing actions of the Galactic tide and nearby passing stars whose effects,
in the standard scenario, are responsible for the phenomenology on which our
confidence in the existence of the cloud itself is based. The present analysis
may be supplemented in future by further statistical Monte Carlo-type
investigations by randomly varying the initial conditions of the comets.
