linked to a property of the fully entangled fraction. We show that the set of
states with their fully entangled fraction bounded by a threshold value
required for performing teleportation is both convex and compact. This feature
enables for the existence of hermitian witness operators the measurement of
which could distinguish unknown states useful for performing teleportation. We
present an example of such a witness operator illustrating it for different

with respect to a Gaussian. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that an
appropriately defined Markov chain, which is reversible with respect to the
measure in question, exhibits a diffusion limit to a noisy gradient flow, also
reversible with respect to the same measure. The Markov chain is defined by
applying a Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject mechanism to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
proposal which is itself reversible with respect to the underlying Gaussian
measure. The resulting noisy gradient flow is a stochastic partial differential
equation driven by a Wiener process with spatial correlation given by the
underlying Gaussian structure.

longitudinal data include a latent process to account for the unobserved
heterogeneity between subjects in a dynamic fashion. Such a process may be
continuous (typically an AR(1)) or discrete (typically a Markov chain). In this
paper, we propose a model for longitudinal data which is based on a mixture of
AR(1) processes with different means and correlation coefficients, but with
equal variances. This model belongs to the class of models based on a
continuous latent process, and then it has a natural interpretation in many
contexts of application, but it is more flexible than other models in this
class, reaching a goodness-of-fit similar to that of a discrete latent process
model, with a reduced number of parameters. We show how to perform maximum
likelihood estimation of the proposed model by the joint use of an
Expectation-Maximisation algorithm and a Newton-Raphson algorithm, implemented
by means of recursions developed in the hidden Markov literature. We also
introduce a simple method to obtain standard errors for the parameter estimates
and a criterion to choose the number of mixture components. The proposed
approach is illustrated by an application to a longitudinal dataset, coming
from the Health and Retirement Study, about self-evaluation of the health
status by a sample of subjects. In this application, the response variable is

compact space. These maps are Lipschitz continuous, with Lipschitz constant
smaller than one, when restricted to any piece of a finite and dense union of
disjoint open pieces. We focus on the topological and the dynamical properties
of the (global) attractor of the orbits that remain in this union. As a
starting point, we show that the attractor consists of a finite set of periodic
points when it does not intersect the boundary of a contraction piece, which
complements similar results proved for more specific classes of piecewise
contracting maps. Then, we explore the case where the attractor intersects
these boundaries by providing examples that show the rich phenomenology of
these systems. Due to the discontinuities, the asymptotic behaviour is not
always properly represented by the dynamics in the attractor. Hence, we
introduce generalized orbits to describe the asymptotic dynamics and its
recurrence and transitivity properties. Our examples include transitive and
recurrent attractors, that are either finite, countable, or a disjoint union of
a Cantor set and a countable set. We also show that the attractor of a
piecewise contracting map is usually a Lebesgue measure-zero set, and we give
conditions ensuring that it is totally disconnected. Finally, we provide an
example of piecewise contracting map with positive topological entropy and

in lattice field theory. It has resisted solution until recently when new ideas
drawn from orbifold constructions and topological field theories have been
brought to bear on the question. The result has been the creation of a new
class of lattice gauge theories in which the lattice action is invariant under
one or more supersymmetries. The resultant theories are local, free of doublers
and also possess exact gauge-invariance. In principle they form the basis for a
truly non-perturbative definition of the continuum SYM theories. In the
continuum limit they lead to a version of the Yang-Mills theory formulated in
terms of {\it twisted} fields. In this paper, we briefly review these ideas and

faded back to its quiescent brightness of r'~23, however, in mid-2008 it

V1647 Ori to be in an elevated photometric state with an optical brightness
similar to the value found at the start of the 2003 and 2008 outbursts. Optical
images taken between 2008 and 2011 suggest that the star has remained in
outburst from mid 2008 to the present. H-alpha and the far-red CaII triplet
lines remain in emission with H-alpha possessing a significant P Cygni profile.

the accretion luminosity and rate both declined by a factor 2-3 during the 5mag
fading in 2007. However, a significant parts of the fading was due to either
variable extinction or dust reformation. We discuss these new observations in
relation to previous published data and the classification schemes for young

results on the convergence of block entropy and block-state entropy in a
geometric setting, one that is more intuitive and that leads to a number of new
results. For example, we connect crypticity to how an observer synchronizes to
a process. We show that the block-causal-state entropy is a convex function of
block length. We give a complete analysis of spin chains. We present a
classification scheme that surveys stationary processes in terms of their
possible cryptic and Markov orders. We illustrate related entropy convergence
behaviors using a new form of foliated information diagram. Finally, along the
way, we provide a variety of interpretations of crypticity and cryptic order to
establish their naturalness and pervasiveness. Hopefully, these will inspire

This shape and its variation with the compacting voltage are reproduced in a

to the middle of the cell and a decreasing electric field that drives the
motion. After complete polarization is achieved, the shape of the peak stops
evolving with further increase of the compacting voltage. The spike-peak

from relativistic Boltzmann equation (RBE) on the basis of the
renormalization-group (RG) method. We introduce a macroscopic-frame vector
(MFV) to specify the local rest frame (LRF) on which the macroscopic dynamics
is described. The five hydrodynamic modes are identified with the same number
of the zero modes of the linearized collision operator, i.e., the collision
invariants. After defining the inner product in the function space spanned by
the distribution function, the higher-order terms, which give rise to the
dissipative effects, are constructed so that they are orthogonal to the zero
modes in terms of the inner product: Here, any ansatz's, such as the so-called
conditions of fit used in the standard methods in an ad-hoc way, are not
necessary. We elucidate that the Burnett term dose not affect the RDHEs owing
to the very nature of the hydrodynamic modes as the zero modes. Applying the RG
equation, we obtain the RDHE in a generic LRF specified by the MFV, as the
coarse-grained and covariant equation. Our generic RDHE reduces to RDHEs in
various LRFs, including the energy and particle LRFs with a choice of the MFV.
We find that our RDHE in the energy LRF coincides with that of Landau and
Lifshitz, while the derived RDHE in the particle LRF is slightly different from
that of Eckart, owing to the presence of the dissipative internal energy. We
prove that the Eckart equation can not be compatible with the underlying RBE.
The proof is made on the basis of the observation that the orthogonality
condition to the zero modes coincides with the ansatz's posed on the
dissipative parts of the energy-momentum tensor and the particle current in the
phenomenological RDHEs. We also present an analytic proof that all of our RDHEs
have a stable equilibrium state owing to the positive definiteness of the inner
product.

enhanced noise but no interference. With the network-coded precoder, each
station receives not only its desired signal and noise, but possibly also
self-interference, which can be perfectly canceled. Precoder design for
optimizing the received signal-to-noise ratios at the destinations is
investigated. For zero-forcing relaying, the problem is solved in closed form

alternate in sign. Other features are known. This paper presents the value of

state self-gravitating systems (SGSs) where many particles interact via the

and galaxies. The idea is to represent an interaction by which a particle of
the system is affected from the others by a special random force. That is, we
will use a special Langevin equation, just as the normal Langevin equation can
unveil the dynamics toward the steady state described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution. However, we cannot introduce the randomness into the system
without any evidence. Then, we must confirm that each orbit is random indeed.
Of course, it is impossible to understand orbits of stars in globular clusters
from observations. Thus we use numerical simulations. From the numerical
simulations of SGS, grounds that we use the random noise become clear. The
special Langevin equation includes the additive and the multiplicative noise.
By using the random process, we derive the non-Maxwellian distribution of SGS
especially around the core. The number density can be obtained through the
steady state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the random
process. We exhibit that the number density becomes equal to the density
profiles around the core by adjusting the friction coefficient and the
intensity of the multiplicative noise. Moreover, we also show that our model
can be applied in the system which has a heavier particle, corresponding to the
black hole in a globular cluster.

classical problem, first studied by Yamamoto, is addressed here by including
two new aspects: (i) The decoder obtains noisy measurements of its sequence,
where the quality of such measurements can be controlled via a cost-constrained
""action"" sequence; (ii) Measurement at the decoder may fail in a way that is
unpredictable to the encoder, thus requiring robust encoding. The considered

further insight into the optimal system design.

broken, then series of phase transitions mark the change of symmetry from the

we observe a short-range positional and long-range orientational order (similar
to a hexatic phase in the condensed matter physics). In other words, the longer
one pumps the system the more ordered it becomes. We show that these phase
transitions happen when the driving term corresponds to an instability (i.e. it
is multiplicative in the k-space) but not when the system is pumped by a random

performed. In such a scenario a frequency based method of investigation is
developed to obtain useful insights on the network. The information thus
derived can be fruitfully exploited to build acyclic graphical models, which
can be seen as extension of Bayesian Networks or Markov Chains. Moreover, it is
shown that the topology of polytree linear networks can be exactly identified

are the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon
distance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to
be candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy
production rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long
GRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view
that GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs. We here suggest that many of the low
luminosity GRBs, due to their low luminosity, can not trigger the current GRB
detectors and hence their contribution to the local gamma-ray energy production
rate is missing. We find that the real local energy production rate by
low-luminosity GRBs, taking into account the missing part, which constitutes a
dominant fraction of the total amount, could be sufficient to account for the
flux of UHECRs. Due to the low-luminosity, only intermediate-mass or heavy
nuclei can be accelerated to ~ 10^20 eV. We discuss the acceleration and
survival of these UHE nuclei in low-luminosity GRBs, especially in those
missing low-luminosity GRBs. At last, the accompanying diffuse neutrino flux

exactly four singular quadrics in the pencil. The singular and non-singular
quadrics are characterized by whether they have one or two rulings by
non-commutative lines. The Picard groups of the smooth quadrics are free
abelian of rank two. The alternating sum of dimensions of Ext groups allows us
to define an intersection pairing on the Picard group of the smooth
noncommutative quadrics. A surprise is that a smooth noncommutative quadric can
sometimes contain a ""curve"" having self-intersection number -2. Many of the
methods used in our paper are noncommutative versions of methods developed by
Buchweitz, Eisenbud and Herzog: in particular, the correspondence between the
geometry of a quadric hypersurface and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over its

is to introduce definitions of non-commutative analogues of the familiar
