spin-orbit interaction, a collection of weakly interacting fermions undergoes a
crossover from a BCS ground state to a BEC ground state when the strength of
the gauge field is increased [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 84}, 014512 (2011)]. The BEC
that is obtained at large gauge coupling strengths is a condensate of tightly
bound bosonic fermion-pairs whose properties are solely determined by the
Rashba gauge field -- hence called rashbons. In this paper, we conduct a
systematic study of the properties of rashbons and their dispersion. This study
reveals a new qualitative aspect of the problem of interacting fermions in
non-Abelian gauge fields, i.e., that the rashbon state induced by the gauge
field for small centre of mass momenta of the fermions ceases to exist when
this momentum exceeds a critical value which is of the order of the gauge
coupling strength. The study allows us to estimate the transition temperature
of the rashbon BEC, and suggests a route to enhance the exponentially small
transition temperature of the system with a fixed weak attraction to the order
of the Fermi temperature by tuning the strength of the non-Abelian gauge field.
The nature of the rashbon dispersion, and in particular the absence of the
rashbon states at large momenta, suggests a regime of parameter space where the
normal state of the system will be a dynamical mixture of uncondensed rashbons
and unpaired helical fermions. Such a state should show many novel features
including pseudogap physics.

  Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory","16 pages, 5 figures",,,,"q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Changes in hydration are central to the phenomenon of biomolecular
recognition, but it has been difficult to properly frame and answer questions
about their precise thermodynamic role. We address this problem by introducing
Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of
Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory on a 3D grid in a volume of interest. Here, the
solvent volume is divided into small grid boxes and localized thermodynamic
entropies, energies and free energies are defined for each grid box.
Thermodynamic solvation quantities are defined in such a manner that summing
the quantities over all the grid boxes yields the desired total quantity for
the system. This approach smoothly accounts for the thermodynamics of not only
highly occupied water sites but also partly occupied and water depleted regions
of the solvent, without the need for ad hoc terms drawn from other theories.
The GIST method has the further advantage of allowing a rigorous end-states
analysis that, for example in the problem of molecular recognition, can account
for not only the thermodynamics of displacing water from the surface but also
for the thermodynamics of solvent reorganization around the bound complex. As a
preliminary application, we present GIST calculations at the 1-body level for
the host cucurbit[7]uril, a low molecular weight receptor molecule which
represents a tractable model for biomolecular recognition. One of the most
striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of water density, at
the center of the host's nonpolar cavity, which is significantly disfavored
entropically, and hence may contribute to the ability of this small receptor to
bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities.

light of the increasing interest in uncertainty quantification and robust
design applications in aerospace engineering, the calculation of expected
values of such functions (e.g. performance measures) becomes important.
However, MC techniques often suffer from high variance and slow convergence as
the number of samples increases. In this paper we present Stacked Monte Carlo
(StackMC), a new method for post-processing an existing set of MC samples to
improve the associated integral estimate. StackMC is based on the supervised
learning techniques of fitting functions and cross validation. It should reduce
the variance of any type of Monte Carlo integral estimate (simple sampling,
importance sampling, quasi-Monte Carlo, MCMC, etc.) without adding bias. We
report on an extensive set of experiments confirming that the StackMC estimate
of an integral is more accurate than both the associated unprocessed Monte
Carlo estimate and an estimate based on a functional fit to the MC samples.
These experiments run over a wide variety of integration spaces, numbers of
sample points, dimensions, and fitting functions. In particular, we apply
StackMC in estimating the expected value of the fuel burn metric of future
commercial aircraft and in estimating sonic boom loudness measures. We compare
the efficiency of StackMC with that of more standard methods and show that for
negligible additional computational cost significant increases in accuracy are
gained.

modeling the coevolution of dust and MRI, we perform three-dimensional,
ohmic-resistive MHD simulations of a vertically stratified shearing box with an

of various strengths. We find that the vertical structure of turbulence is well
characterized by the vertical magnetic flux and three critical heights derived
from the linear analysis of MRI in a stratified disk. In particular, the
turbulent structure depends on the resistivity profile only through the
critical heights and is insensitive to the details of the resistivity profile.
We discover scaling relations between the amplitudes of various turbulent

coefficient, and outflow mass flux) and vertically integrated accretion
stresses. We also obtain empirical formulae for the integrated accretion

geomagnetic variations induced by the movement of electrically conducting
sea-water through the geomagnetic field, i. e., the identification of
transients related to the tsunamis. As well, using the minutely magnetogram
data, it was able to localize the initial phase and time of the tsunami maximum
height. The first interpretation of the results suggests that discrete wavelet
transform can be used to characterize the tsumani effects on the geomagnetic
field, but need further study.

of the investigations into the dynamical interaction of virus and defective
interfering particles (DIP), which are incomplete forms of the virus that
replicate through co-infection, have followed the same lines. In this work we
present an agent based model of viral infection with consideration of DIP and
the negative feedback loop introduced by interferon production as part of the
host innate immune response. The model is based high resolution microscopic
images of plaques of dead cells we took from mammalian cells infected with
Sendai virus with low and high DIP. In order to investigate the effects of the
discrete stochastic microscopic mechanisms, which are responsible for virus
spreading, have on the macroscopic growth of viral plaques, we generate an
agent-based model of viral infection. The two main aims of this work are to (i)
investigate the effects of discrete microscopic randomness on the macroscopic
growth of viral plaques; and (ii) examine the dynamic interactions between the
full length virus, DIP and interferon, and interpret what may be the function
of DIP. We find that we can explain the qualitative differences between our
stochastic model and deterministic models in terms of the fractal geometry of
the resulting plaques, and that DIP have a delaying effect while the
interaction between interferon and DIP has a slowing effect on the growth of
viral plaques, potentially contributing to viral latency.

mode populations differing by more than a certain threshold, while not
revealing which mode is more populated. It would allow engineering of
macroscopic quantum states of light in a way which is preserving specific
superpositions. As a result, it would enhance optical phase estimation with
these states as well as distinguishability of ""macroscopic"" qubits. We propose
an optical scheme, which is a relatively simple, albeit non-ideal, operational
implementation of such a filter. It uses tapping of the original polarization
two-mode field, with a polarization neutral beam splitter of low reflectivity.
Next, the reflected beams are suitably interfered on a polarizing beam
splitter. It is oriented such that it selects unbiased polarization modes with
respect to the original ones. The more an incoming two-mode Fock state is
unequally populated, the more the polarizing beam splitter output modes are
equally populated. This effect is especially pronounced for highly populated
states. Additionally, for such states we expect strong population correlations
between the original fields and the tapped one. Thus, after a photon-number
measurement of the polarizing beam splitter outputs, a feed-forward loop can be
used to let through a shutter the field, which was transmitted by the tapping
beam splitter. This happens only if the counts at the outputs are roughly
equal. In such a case, the transmitted field differs strongly in occupation
number of the two modes, while information on which mode is more populated is
non-existent (a necessary condition for preserving superpositions).

to hours), dynamical tides involving the excitation and dissipation of gravity
waves play a dominant role in determining the physical conditions of the WDs
prior to mass transfer or binary merger. We calculate the amplitude of the
tidally excited gravity waves as a function of the tidal forcing frequency
\omega=2(\Omega-\Omega_s) (where \Omega is the orbital frequency and \Omega_s
is the spin frequency) for several realistic carbon-oxygen WD models, assuming
that the waves are efficiently dissipated in the outer layer of the star by
nonlinear effects or radiative damping. The mechanism of wave excitation in WDs
is complex due to the sharp features associated with composition changes inside
the WD, and in our WD models gravity waves are launched just below the
helium-carbon boundary. We find that the tidal torque on the WD and the related
tidal energy transfer rate, \dot E_{\rm tide}, depend on \omega in an erratic
way. On average, \dot E_{\rm tide} scales approximately as \Omega^5\omega^5 for
a large range of tidal frequencies. We also study the effects of dynamical
tides on the long-term evolution of WD binaries. Above a critical orbital
frequency \Omega_c, corresponding to an orbital period of order one hour
(depending on WD models), dynamical tides efficiently drive \Omega_s toward
\Omega, although a small, almost constant degree of asynchronization
(\Omega-\Omega_s\sim {\rm constant}) is maintained even at the smallest binary
periods. While the orbital decay is always dominated by gravitational
radiation, the tidal energy transfer can induce significant phase error in the
low-frequency gravitational waveforms, detectable by the planned LISA project.
Tidal dissipation may also lead to significant heating of the WD envelope and
brightening of the system long before binary merger.

dependence in these species. We explore the capabilities of our methods to
detect density dependent effects, both by simulation and through analyzes of

examined. We conclude that our priors, which are motivated by considering the
dynamics of the system of interest, offer clear advances over the priors used
by previous authors for the duck data sets. We use this analysis as a
motivating example to demonstrate the importance of careful parameter prior
selection if we are to perform a balanced model selection procedure. We also
present some simple guidelines that can be followed in a wide variety of

selecting certain models, but improve the predictive ability of the resulting

model from a given initial density. The density, a macroscopic variable, needs
to be mapped to the distribution functions, mesoscopic variables, of the
lattice Boltzmann model. Several methods proposed as lifting operators have
been tested and discussed in the literature. The most famous methods are an
analytically found lifting operator, like the Chapman-Enskog expansion, and a
numerical method, like the Constrained Runs algorithm, to arrive at an implicit
expression for the unknown distribution functions with the help of the density.
This paper proposes a lifting operator that alleviates several drawbacks of
these existing methods. In particular, we focus on the computational expense
and the analytical work that needs to be done. The proposed lifting operator, a
numerical Chapman-Enskog expansion, obtains the coefficients of the
Chapman-Enskog expansion numerically. Another important feature of the use of
lifting operators is found in hybrid models. There the lattice Boltzmann model
is spatially coupled with a model based on a more macroscopic description, for
example an advection-diffusion-reaction equation. In one part of the domain,
the lattice Boltzmann model is used, while in another part, the more
macroscopic model. Such a hybrid coupling results in missing data at the
interfaces between the different models. A lifting operator is then an
important tool since the lattice Boltzmann model is typically described by more
variables than a model based on a macroscopic partial differential equation.

rate of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) as a function of galaxy properties at
intermediate redshift. A sample of 342 SNe Ia with 0.05<z<0.25 is constructed.
Using broad-band photometry we use the PEGASE spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) to estimate host galaxy stellar masses and recent star-formation rates.
We find that the rate of SNe Ia per unit stellar mass is significantly higher
(by a factor of ~30) in highly star-forming galaxies compared to passive
galaxies. When parameterizing the SN Ia rate (SNR_Ia) based on host galaxy
properties, we find that the rate of SNe Ia in passive galaxies is not linearly
proportional to the stellar mass, instead a SNR_Ia proportional to M^0.68 is
favored. However, such a parameterization does not describe the observed SN Ia
rate in star-forming galaxies. The SN Ia rate in star-forming galaxies is well
fit by SNR_Ia = 1.05\pm0.16x10^{-10} M ^{0.68\pm0.01} + 1.01\pm0.09x10^{-3}
SFR^{1.00\pm0.05} (statistical errors only), where M is the host galaxy mass
and SFR is the star-formation rate. These results are insensitive to the
selection criteria used, redshift limit considered and the inclusion of
non-spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia. We also show there is a dependence
between the distribution of the MLCS light-curve decline rate parameter,
\Delta, and host galaxy type. Passive galaxies host less luminous SNe Ia than
seen in moderately and highly star-forming galaxies, although a population of
luminous SNe is observed in passive galaxies, contradicting previous assertions
that these SNe Ia are only observed in younger stellar systems. The MLCS
extinction parameter, A_V, is similar in passive and moderately star-forming
galaxies, but we find indications that it is smaller, on average, in highly
star-forming galaxies. We confirm these results using the SALT2 light-curve
fitter.

collimated during their early evolution compared to later stages. Our paper
investigates various physical processes that impacts the outflow dynamics, i.e.
its acceleration and collimation. We perform axisymmetric MHD simulations
particularly considering the radiation pressure exerted by the star and the
disk. We have modified the PLUTO code to include radiative forces in the
line-driving approximation. We launch the outflow from the innermost disk
region (r < 50 AU) by magneto-centrifugal acceleration. In order to disentangle
MHD effects from radiative forces, we start the simulation in pure MHD, and
later switch on the radiation force. We perform a parameter study considering
different stellar masses (thus luminosity), magnetic flux, and line-force
strength. For our reference simulation - assuming a 30 Msun star, we find
substantial de-collimation of 35 % due to radiation forces. The opening angle
increases from 20 deg to 32 deg for stellar masses from 20 Msun to 60 Msun. A
small change in the line-force parameter 'alpha' from 0.60 to 0.55 changes the
opening angle by ~ 8 deg. We find that it is mainly the stellar radiation which
affects the jet dynamics. Unless the disk extends very close to the star, its
pressure is too small to have much impact. Essentially, our parameter runs with
different stellar mass can be understood as a proxy for the time evolution of
the star-outflow system. Thus, we have shown that when the stellar mass (thus
luminosity) increases (with age), the outflows become less collimated.

According to the standard viewpoint, the homogeneous and isotropic mode of the
inflaton field drove an early phase of nearly exponential expansion of the
universe, while the quantum fluctuations (uncertainties) of the other modes
gave rise to the seeds of cosmic structure. However, if we accept that the
accelerated expansion led the universe into an essentially homogeneous and
isotropic space-time, with the state of all the matter fields in their vacuum
(except for the zero mode of the inflaton field), we can not escape the
conclusion that the state of the universe as a whole would remain always
homogeneous and isotropic. It was recently proposed in [A. Perez, H. Sahlmann
and D. Sudarsky, ""On the quantum origin of the seeds of cosmic structure,""
Class. Quant. Grav. 23, 2317-2354 (2006)] that a collapse (representing physics
beyond the established paradigm, and presumably associated with a
quantum-gravity effect a la Penrose) of the state function of the inflaton
field might be the missing element, and thus would be responsible for the
emergence of the primordial inhomogeneities. Here we will discuss a formalism
that relies strongly on quantum field theory on curved space-times, and within
which we can implement a detailed description of such a process. The picture
that emerges clarifies many aspects of the problem, and is conceptually quite
transparent. Nonetheless, we will find that the results lead us to argue that
the resulting picture is not fully compatible with a purely geometric

the conifold, and N_f flavor D7-branes wrapping a holomorphic four-cycle inside

gauge theory without flavor and was thoroughly studied in the past. Besides,
there is a Higgs branch where some D3 and/or D5-branes dissolve in the
D7-branes forming the worldvolume gauge instantons. We study the Higgs branch
both from the field theory and the bulk point of view. On the classical level
the moduli space is closely related to the one of the N=2 C^2/Z_2 orbifold
theory, in particular certain vacua of the N=1 theory are related to
noncommutative instantons on the resolved C^2/Z_2. On the quantum level the
Higgs branch acquires corrections due to renormalization of the Kahler
potential and non-perturbative effects in field theory. In the bulk this is
encoded in the classical D7-brane geometry. We compute the VEVs of the
protected operators and the field theory RG flow and find an agreement with the
parallel computations in the bulk.

non-negative and generally not equal to the coherent information between the
source and distorted output (in spite of Barnum's conjecture that the coherent
information would be relevant here). Moreover, we prove several quantum
source-channel separation theorems. The strongest of these are in the

encodings compared to the ones in standard ASP language. In this paper, we
experimentally compare the original encodings (for the argumentation semantics

vapor pressures low enough for the the liquid (capillary) phase of the
adsorbate to be absent, has long been vaguely attributed to changes in the
nanopore structure, but no mathematically consistent explanation has been
presented. The present work takes an analytical approach to account for
discrete molecular forces in the nanopore fluid and proposes two related
mechanisms that can explain the hysteresis at low vapor pressure without
assuming any change in the nanopore structure. The first mechanism, presented
in Part I, consists of a series of snap-through instabilities during the
filling or emptying of non-uniform nanopores or nanoscale asperities. The
instabilities are caused by non-uniqueness in the misfit disjoining pressures
engendered by a difference between the nanopore width and an integer multiple
of the thickness of a monomolecular adsorption layer. The second mechanism,
presented in Part II, consists of molecular coalescence within a partially
filled surface, nanopore or nanopore network. This general thermodynamic
instability is driven by attractive intermolecular forces within the adsorbate
and forms the basis to develop a unified theory of both mechanisms. The
ultimate goals of the theory are to predict the fluid transport in nanoporous
solids from microscopic first principles, and to determine the pore size
distribution and internal surface area from sorption tests.

climate variables and consequent selection pressure by using simple models of
population dynamics. Higher variance of climate variables increases the
probability of weather extremes and consequent catastrophic disturbances.
Parameters of the model are selection pressure, mutation, directional and
stochastic variation of the environment. We follow the population dynamics and
the distribution of a trait that describes the adaptation of the individual to
the optimum phenotype defined by the environmental conditions. The survival
chances of a population depend quite strongly on the selection pressure and
decrease with increasing variance of the climate variable. In general, the
system is able to track the directional component of the optimum phenotype.
Intermediate levels of mutation generally increase the probability of tracking
the changing optimum and thus decrease the risk of extinction of a population.
With high mutation, the higher probability of maladaptation decreases the
survival chances of the populations, even with high variability of the optimum
phenotype.

sustain life in one or more chemical environments. For such networks, we define
a network module as a maximal set of reactions that are fully coupled, i.e.,
whose fluxes can only vary in fixed proportions. This definition overcomes
limitations of purely graph based analyses of metabolism by exploiting the
functional links between reactions. We call a metabolic network viable in a

Triangulations (CDTs) is to use the causal (or light-cone) structure of
Lorentzian manifolds to restrict the class of geometries appearing in the
Quantum Gravity (QG) path integral. By exploiting this structure the models
developed in CDTs differ from the analogous models developed in the Euclidean
domain, models of (Euclidean) Dynamical Triangulations (DT), and the
corresponding Lorentzian results are in many ways more ""physical"".
  In this paper we use this insight to formulate a Lorentzian signature model
that is analogous to the Quantum Regge Calculus (QRC) approach to Euclidean
Quantum Gravity. We exploit another crucial fact about the structure of
Lorentzian manifolds, namely that certain simplices are not constrained by the
triangle inequalities present in Euclidean signature. We show that this model
is not related to QRC by a naive Wick rotation; this serves as another
demonstration that the sum over Lorentzian geometries is not simply related to
the sum over Euclidean geometries. By removing the triangle inequality
constraints, there is more freedom to perform analytical calculations, and in
addition numerical simulations are more computationally efficient.
  We first formulate the model in 1+1 dimensions, and derive scaling relations
for the pure gravity path integral on the torus using two different measures.
It appears relatively easy to generate ""large"" universes, both in spatial and
temporal extent. In addition, loop-to-loop amplitudes are discussed, and a
transfer matrix is derived. We then also discuss the model in higher

constitute a chain model for the framed little disks operad, proving a cyclic

minimal operad of Kontsevich and Soibelman as a suboperad and restriction of
the action to this suboperad recovers their results in the unframed case.

Paper 447",,,"nucl-th hep-ex hep-ph nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This dissertation investigated selected processes involving baryons and
nuclei in hard scattering reactions. Through these processes, this work
explored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which
the interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected
reactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied
considering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant
mechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an
angular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is
explained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the
nucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter
yields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign
opposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard
breakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton
(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron
breakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in
conjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.
Cross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed
without the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp
breakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double
Delta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the
two double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An
important prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel
consistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that
unlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the
interaction. For such models both channels should have the same strength.

Still, the fundamental relationship between these solutions such as whether

conceptual gap by presenting a general theoretical framework showing that under
appropriate conditions, the global solution of nonconvex regularization leads
to desirable recovery performance; moreover, under suitable conditions, the
global solution corresponds to the unique sparse local solution, which can be
obtained via different numerical procedures. Under this unified framework, we
present an overview of existing results and discuss their connections. The

but ages originating from isotopic analyses are still identified with a lack of
clarity and using models that occasionally are unrealistic. If the effect of
advection and dispersion on water ages has already been extensively identified,
very few studies address the reliability of using radiometric ages as derived
from isotopic data to estimate aquifer properties such as average velocities.
Using simple one-dimensional and two-dimensional analytical solutions for
single-site and two-sites mobile-immobile systems, we compare the radiometric
ages to the mean ages (or residence times) as deduced from a direct,
physically-based simulation approach (using the mean age equation), and show
that the competition between isotope decay rate and dispersion coefficient can
generate important discrepancies between the two types of ages. A correction
for the average apparent velocity originating from apparent isotopic ages is
additionally provided. The particular case of the Tritium age dating method is
also addressed, and a numerical example is finally given for illustrating the
analysis considering a more complex and heterogeneous aquifer system. Our
results suggest that age definitions based on the radioactivity of isotopes may
not be representative for the mean age of the sample or for the groundwater
velocity at given locations, and may not always be suitable for constraining
the calibration of hydrogeological models.

(PEs) in tetravalent salt solutions under the action of electric fields by
means of molecular dynamics simulations. Chain conformations are found to have
a sensitive dependence on salt concentration $C_s$. As $C_s$ is increased, the
chains first shrink to a globular structure and subsequently reexpand above a
critical concentration $C_s^*$. An external electric field can further alter
the chain conformation. If the field strength $E$ is larger than a critical
value $E^*$, the chains are elongated. $E^*$ is shown to be a function of $C_s$
by using two estimators $E_{I}^*$ and $E_{II}^*$ through the study of the
polarization energy and the onset point of chain unfolding, respectively. The
electrophoretic mobility of the chains depends strongly on $C_s$, and the
magnitude increases significantly, accompanying the chain unfolding, when $E>
E_{II}^*$. We study the condensed ion distributions modified by electric fields
and discuss the connection of the modification with the change of chain
morphology and mobility. Finally, $E^*$ is studied by varying the chain length
$N$. The inflection point is used as a third estimator $E_{III}^*$. $E_{III}^*$
scales as $N^{-0.63(4)}$ and $N^{-0.76(2)}$ at $C_s=0.0$ and $C_s^*$,
respectively. $E_{II}^*$ follows a similar scaling law to $E_{III}^*$ but a
crossover appears at $C_s=C_s^*$ when $N$ is small. The $E_{I}^*$ estimator
fails to predict the critical field, which is due to oversimplifying the
critical polarization energy to the thermal energy. Our results provide
valuable information to understand the electrokinetics of PE solutions at the

exact value of these parameters is not practical in communication systems. To
study the effect of uncertainty and preserve the players' utilities in these

framework, the leaders' information and the followers' observations are
uncertain parameters, and the leaders and the followers choose their actions by
solving the worst-case robust optimizations. We show that the followers'
uncertain parameters always increase the leaders' utilities and decrease the
followers' utilities. Conversely, the leaders' uncertain information reduces
the leaders' utilities and increases the followers' utilities. We illustrate
our theoretical results with the numerical results obtained based on the power

with previous work on this event, and provided boundary conditions for
modeling. We found that the intensity in the dimming region dramatically drops
within 30 minutes from the flare onset, and the dimming region reaches the
equilibrium stage after $\sim$1 hour later. The temperature-dependent upflows
were observed during the equilibrium stage by EIS. The cross sectional area of
the fluxtube in the dimming region does not appear to expand significantly.
From the observational constraints, we reconstructed the temperature-dependent
upflow by using a new method which considers the mass and momentum conservation
law, and demonstrated the height variation of plasma conditions in the dimming
region. We found that a super radial expansion of the cross sectional area is
required to satisfy the mass conservation and momentum equations. There is a
steep temperature and velocity gradient of around 7 Mm from the solar surface.
This result may suggest that the strong heating occurred above 7 Mm from the
solar surface in the dimming region. We also showed that the ionization

  The resolution and shape of the coarse-graining function used in the

effects can be studied. The method does not require temporal averaging and thus
can be used to investigate time-dependent flows as well as static and steady
situations. Finally, the fore-mentioned continuous field can be used to define
'fuzzy' (highly rough) boundaries. Two discrete particle method simulations are
presented in which the novel boundary treatment is exemplified, including a

unitary comoving volume of the Universe, is a fundamental clue to investigate
the history of the assembling and evolution of structures in the Universe. Here
we develop a method to study the CSFR from a purely theoretical point of view.
Starting from detailed models of chemical evolution, which best fit the
properties of local galaxies, we obtain the histories of star formation of
galaxies of different morphological types (ellipticals, spirals, irregulars).
These histories are then used to determine the photometric evolution of
galaxies by means of a spectro-photometric code. The next step in computing the
CSFR is the calculation of the luminosity density for which we need to know how
galaxies are distributed in the Universe at any redshift. This is possible
thanks to the luminosity function (LF) of galaxies. At this point we calculate
the CSFR under different evolutionary scenarios. First, we study the hypothesis
of a pure luminosity evolution scenario, in which galaxies are supposed to form
all at the same redshift and then evolve only in luminosity without any merging
or interaction. In other words, we assume no number density evolution. Then we
define scenarios in which the number density and the slope of the LF are
assumed to vary with redshift. All our results have been compared with data
available in literature. We conclude that a pure number density evolution does
not provide a good fit to the data. On the other hand, a variation in the
number density for ellipticals and spirals as a function of redshift can
provide a better fit to the observed CSFR, although the data at very high
redshift are still quite uncertain and this solution predicts that most of the

the current and substrate. Particular attention is paid to the erosion and
deposition of the substrate particles, including application of an active layer
model. Multiple flows are modeled from a lock release that can show the
development of sediment waves (SW). These are stream-wise waves that are
triggered by the increasing slope on the downstream side of the obstacle. The
initial obstacle is completely erased by the resuspension after a few flows
leading to self consistent and self generated SW that are weakly dependant on
the initial obstacle. The growth of these waves is directly related to the
turbidity current being self sustaining, that is, the net erosion is more than
the net deposition. Four system parameters are found to influence the SW
growth: (1) slope, (2) current lock height, (3) grain lock concentration, and
(4) particle diameters. Three phases are discovered for the system: (1) ""no
SW"", (2) ""SW buildup"", and (3) ""SW growth"". The second phase consists of a
soliton-like SW structure with a preserved shape. The phase diagram of the

characteristics of wireless communications? The quality of connectivity
measures how easily and reliably a packet sent by a node can reach another

network in saturated traffic scenarios and provides a native measure of the
quality of (end-to-end) network connections. In this paper, we explore the use
of probabilistic connectivity matrix as a possible tool to measure the quality

transiently heated dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, even for

large Lz there are two permissible regions of non-plunging motion bounded by
two closed curves of zero velocity (CZV), while in the Kerr metric there is
only one closed CZV of non-plunging motion. The inner permissible region of the
MN metric contains mainly chaotic orbits, but it contains also a large island
of stability. We find the positions of the main periodic orbits as functions of
Lz and E, and their bifurcations. Around the main periodic orbit of the outer
region there are islands of stability that do not appear in the Kerr metric. In
a realistic binary system, because of the gravitational radiation, the energy E
and the angular momentum Lz of an inspiraling compact object decrease and
therefore the orbit of the object is non-geodesic. In fact in an EMRI system
the energy E and the angular momentum Lz decrease adiabatically and therefore
the motion of the inspiraling object is characterized by the fundamental
frequencies which are drifting slowly in time. In the Kerr metric the ratio of
the fundamental frequencies changes strictly monotonically in time. However, in
the MN metric when an orbit is trapped inside an island the ratio of the
fundamental frequencies remains constant for some time. Hence, if such a
phenomenon is observed this will indicate that the system is non integrable and
therefore the central object is not a Kerr black hole.

given a semantics for those using Scott domains whose elements are (possibly
infinite) sequences of values. This model has since then become a standard tool
for studying distributed asynchronous computations. From the beginning, process
networks have been drawn as particular graphs, but this syntax is never
formalized. We take the opportunity to clarify it by giving a precise
definition of these graphs, that we call nets. The resulting category is shown
to be a fixpoint category, i.e. a cartesian category which is traced wrt the
monoidal structure given by the product, and interestingly this structure
characterizes the category: we show that it is the free fixpoint category
containing a given set of morphisms, thus providing a complete axiomatics that
models of process networks should satisfy. We then use these tools to build a
model of networks in which data vary over a continuous time, in order to
elaborate on the idea that process networks should also be able to encompass
computational models such as hybrid systems or electric circuits. We relate
this model to Kahn's semantics by introducing a third model of networks based
on non-standard analysis, whose elements form an internal complete partial
order for which many properties of standard domains can be reformulated. The
use of hyperreals in this model allows it to formally consider the notion of
infinitesimal, and thus to make a bridge between discrete and continuous time:
time is ""discrete"", but the duration between two instants is infinitesimal.
Finally, we give some examples of uses of the model by describing some networks
implementing common constructions in analysis.

preserving and completely positive transformations in the space of quantum
states. Such operations describe discrete time evolution of an open quantum
system interacting with an environment. The thesis contains an analysis of
properties of quantum channels and different entropies used to quantify the
decoherence introduced into the system by a given operation. Part I of the
thesis provides a general introduction to the subject. In Part II, the action
of a quantum channel is treated as a process of preparation of a quantum
ensemble. The Holevo information associated with this ensemble is shown to be
bounded by the entropy exchanged during the preparation process between the
initial state and the environment. A relation between the Holevo information
and the entropy of an auxiliary matrix consisting of square root fidelities
between the elements of the ensemble is proved in some special cases. Weaker
bounds on the Holevo information are also established. The entropy of a
channel, also called the map entropy, is defined as the entropy of the state
corresponding to the channel by the Jamiolkowski isomorphism. In Part III of
the thesis, the additivity of the entropy of a channel is proved. The minimal
output entropy, which is difficult to compute, is estimated by an entropy of a
channel which is much easier to obtain. A class of quantum channels is
specified, for which additivity of channel capacity is conjectured. The last
part of the thesis contains characterization of Davies channels, which
correspond to an interaction of a state with a thermal reservoir in the week
coupling limit, under the condition of quantum detailed balance and
independence of rotational and dissipative evolutions. The Davies channels are
characterized for one-qubit and one-qutrit systems.

description of gravitational field equations. It remains unclear, we argue,
whether this property is necessarily interwoven with gravity itself or can be
understood instead as a manifestation of physics outside gravity.
  It is pointed out that if the latter is the case, so that the holographic
property of entropy could be considered as completely rooted on some
microscopic, non-gravitational, intrinsic property of matter, gravity could
merely be understood as the necessary macroscopic manifestation of this
microscopic property of matter, being simply the expression of the
thermodynamic conservation of energy. A quite peculiar status of Einstein's
gravity in this context (as compared to generalized metric theories of gravity)
is apparent. A successful microscopic property of matter, is found to
necessarily mean in particular the existence of an absolute minimum wavelength
for photons, of orders of Planck length.

excitation temperature, leading to a more exact evaluation of the column
densities and abundances. We find that the optical depths of both H13CN(1-0)

temperatures for these transitions in many positions in the three sources. The
observed excitation temperatures are consistent with recent computations of the
collisional rates for these species and they correlate with hydrogen column
density inferred from dust emission. We conclude that HCN and HNC are
relatively abundant in the high density zone, n(H2) about 10^5 cm-3, where CO
is depleted. The relative abundance [HNC]/[HCN] differs from unity by at most
30 per cent consistent with chemical expectations. The three hyperfine

the number of particles, despite the presence of electrostatic interactions.
Thus, this model allows to perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations
of metal oxides with realistic potentials. Details of the implementation are
given, and the generation of potentials for SiO2 and MgO is demonstrated. The
approach is validated by simulations of microstructural, thermodynamic and
vibrational properties of liquid silica and magnesia.

explicit example where there is a direct connection between the properly
determined vacuum energy and the cosmological constant of the effective gravity
emerging in condensed matter. This is in contrast to the acoustic gravity
emerging in Bose-Einstein condensates, where the ""value of this constant cannot
be easily predicted by just looking at the ground state energy of the
microscopic system from which spacetime and its dynamics should emerge"" (S.
Finazzi, S. Liberati and L. Sindoni, The cosmological constant: a lesson from
Bose-Einstein condensates, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 071101 (2012)). The advantage
of topological matter is that the relativistic fermions and gauge bosons
emerging near the Weyl point obey the same effective metric and thus the
effective gravity is more closely related to real gravity. We study this
connection in the bi-metric gravity emerging in 3He-A, and its relation to the
graviton masses, by comparison with a fully relativistic bi-metric theory of
gravity. This shows that the parameter \lambda, which in 3He-A is the bi-metric
generalization of the cosmological constant, coincides with the difference in
the proper energy of the vacuum in two states (the nonequilibrium state without
gravity and the equilibrium state in which gravity emerges) and is on the order
of the characteristic Planck energy scale of the system. Although the
cosmological constant \lambda\ is huge, the cosmological term itself is
naturally non-constant and vanishes in the equilibrium vacuum, as dictated by
thermodynamics. This suggests that the equilibrium state of any system
including the final state of the Universe is not gravitating.

properties of red giant stars is reviewed. While red giants are generally
characterised by low surface rotational velocities, they may have been rotating
much more rapidly during the main sequence, so that the rotational history of a
star has a large impact on its properties during the red giant phase. For stars
massive enough to ignite helium burning in non-degenerate conditions,
rotational mixing leads to a significant increase of the stellar luminosity and
shifts the location of the core helium burning phase to a higher luminosity in
the HR diagram. This results in a change of the seismic properties of red
giants and of the fundamental parameters of a red giant star as determined by
performing an asteroseismic calibration. For red giants with a lower mass that
undergo the helium flash, rotational mixing decreases the luminosity of the
bump at solar metallicity changing thereby the global and asteroseismic
properties of these stars.

through quantum chaotic systems have demonstrated the exponential suppression
of the weak localization corrections to the conductance and of the Fano factor
for shot-noise when the Ehrenfest time exceeds the electronic dwell time. On
the other hand, conductance fluctuations, an effect of quantum coherence,
retain their universal value in the limit of the ratio of Ehrenfest time over
dwell time to infinity, when the system is ideally coupled to external leads.
Motivated by this intriguing result we investigate conductance fluctuations
through quantum chaotic cavities coupled to external leads via (tunnel)
barriers of arbitrary transparency. Using the trajectory-based semiclassical
theory of transport, we find a linear Ehrenfest time-dependence of the
conductance variance showing a nonmonotonous, sinusoidal behavior as a function
of the transperancy. Most notably, we find an increase of the conductance
fluctuations with the Ehrenfest time, above their universal value, for the
transparency less than 0.5. These results, confirmed by numerical simulations,
show that, contrarily to the common wisdom, effects of quantum coherence may
increase in the semiclassical limit, under special circumstances.

single-packet messages over radio channel for tiny, battery powered, receivers.
The messages are labeled by the keys from some linearly ordered set. The sender
repeatedly broadcasts a sequence of many (possibly millions) of messages, while
each receiver is interested in reception of a message with a specified key
within this sequence. The transmission is arranged so that the receiver can
wake up in arbitrary moment and find the nearest transmission of its searched
message. Even if it does not know the position of the message in the sequence,
it needs only to receive a small number of (the headers of) other messages to
locate it properly. Thus it can save energy by keeping the radio switched off
most of the time. We show that bit-reversal permutation has ""recursive
bisection properties"" and, as a consequence, RBO can be implemented very
efficiently with only constant number of $\log_2 n$-bit variables, where $n$ is
the total number of messages in the sequence. The total number of the required
receptions is at most $2\log_2 n +2$ in the model with perfect synchronization.
The basic procedure of RBO (computation of the time slot for the next required
reception) requires only $O(\log^3 n)$ bit-wise operations. We propose
implementation mechanisms for realistic model (with imperfect synchronization),
for operating systems (such as e.g. TinyOS).

  First is introduced the singular semi-Riemannian geometry for metrics which
can change their signature (in particular be degenerate). The standard
operations like covariant contraction, covariant derivative, and constructions
like the Riemann curvature are usually prohibited by the fact that the metric
is not invertible. The things become even worse at the points where the
signature changes. We show that we can still do many of these operations, in a
different framework which we propose. This allows the writing of an equivalent
form of Einstein's equation, which works for degenerate metric too.
  Once we make the singularities manageable from mathematical viewpoint, we can
extend analytically the black hole solutions and then choose from the maximal
extensions globally hyperbolic regions. Then we find space-like foliations for
these regions, with the implication that the initial data can be preserved in
reasonable situations. We propose qualitative models of non-primordial and/or

direct reverberation mapping, (2) derivation of BLR radius for larger samples
using the radius-luminosity correlation derived from reverberation measures,
and (3) estimates of BLR radius using the definition of the ionization

0.7) FWHM H-beta serves as the most widely used estimator of virial velocity
dispersion. FWHM H-beta can provide estimates for tens of thousands of quasars
out to z ~ 3.8 (IR spectroscopy beyond z ~ 1). A new photoionization method
also shows promise for providing many reasonable estimates of BLR radius via
high S/N IR spectroscopy of the UV region 1300 -- 2000 A. FWHM MgII 2800 can
serve as a surrogate for FWHM H-beta in the range 0.4 < z < 6.5 while CIV 1549
is affected by broadening due to non-virial motions and best avoided (i.e.
there is no clear conversion factor between FWHM H-beta and FWHM CIV 1549).
Most quasars yield black hole mass estimates in the range 7 < log M< 9.7. There
is no strong evidence for values above 10.0 and there may be evidence for a

that always incorporates thermal vibrations even though it is also possible to
analyze the same data by ignoring them. Of the two possibilities, ignoring
thermal vibrations in both theoretical models and analysis of diffraction data
leads to the latter giving different magnetic order parameters for different
reciprocal lattice lines. This appears to be the first report of a unique
consequence, viz. the assumption to neglect a physical phenomenon turns a
single-valued experimental observable into a multiple-valued one where all
values are equally valid. This assumption is clearly unacceptable and must be
rejected. The second possibility of incorporating thermal vibrations in both

analysis of neutron diffraction data constrain the exchange interaction in all
theoretical models to be temperature dependent and represented as Jij(T).
Additional experimental and theoretical evidences in support of this conclusion

on single photons is at the heart of quantum communication and optical quantum
information processing. The combination of single-photon sources, passive
optical circuits and single-photon detectors enables quantum repeaters and
qubit amplifiers, and also forms the basis of all-optical quantum gates and of
linear-optics quantum computing. However, the monolithic integration of
sources, waveguides and detectors on the same chip, as needed for scaling to
meaningful number of qubits, is very challenging, and previous work on quantum
photonic circuits has used external sources and detectors. Here we propose an
approach to a fully-integrated quantum photonic circuit on a semiconductor
chip, and demonstrate a key component of such circuit, a waveguide
single-photon detector. Our detectors, based on superconducting nanowires on
GaAs ridge waveguides, provide high efficiency (20%) at telecom wavelengths,
high timing accuracy (60 ps), response time in the ns range, and are fully
compatible with the integration of single-photon sources, passive networks and
modulators.

relative fitness between the homozygotes and the heterozygote. It turns out
that for the three-allele model there are 14 patterns and for the four-allele

2351 patterns for the five-allele model. For the six-allele model, there are

on T^*M (the ""kinetic energy"") with respect to the twisted symplectic form
w_{T^*M}+ \pi^*w describes the trajectories of a particle moving on M under the

we can study the geometric quantization of the symplectic manifold
(T^*M,w_{T^*M}+\pi^*w) with the kinetic energy Hamiltonian. We say that the
quantizations of two such tori (M_1,h_1,w_1) and (M_2,h_2,w_2) are quantum
equivalent if their quantum spectra, i.e., the spectra of the associated
quantum Hamiltonian operators, coincide; these quantum Hamiltonian operators
are proportional to the h_j-induced bundle Laplacians on powers of the
Hermitian line bundle on M with Chern class [w].
  In this paper, we construct continuous families {(M,h_t)}_t of mutually

symplectic structure w, such that the associated classical Hamiltonian systems
are pairwise equivalent. If w represents an integer cohomology class, then the

translation-invariant metric h and any translation-invariant symplectic
structure w on M that represents an integer cohomology class, the associated
quantum spectrum determines whether (M,h,w) is Kaehler, and that all
translation-invariant Kaehler structures (h,w) of given volume on M have the
same quantum spectra. Finally, we construct pairs of magnetic fields (M,h,w_1),
(M,h,w_2) having the same quantum spectra but nonsymplectomorphic classical

users voluntarily signal their current location, opens the door to powerful
studies on human movement. In particular the fine granularity of the location
data, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of
Foursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility
patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing
a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in
human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are
predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban
environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which
isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of
places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as
considered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a
rank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different

mobility, with potential applications for urban planning, location-based
