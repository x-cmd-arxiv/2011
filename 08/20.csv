the non-asymptotic variance of particle approximations of time-homogeneous
Feynman-Kac formulae. These formulae appear in a wide variety of applications
including option pricing in finance and risk sensitive control in engineering.
In direct Monte Carlo approximation of these formulae, the non-asymptotic
variance typically increases at an exponential rate in the time parameter. It
is shown that a linear bound holds when a non-negative kernel, defined by the
logarithmic potential function and Markov kernel which specify the Feynman-Kac
model, satisfies a type of multiplicative drift condition and other regularity
assumptions. Examples illustrate that these conditions are general and flexible
enough to accommodate two rather extreme cases, which can occur in the context
of a non-compact state space: 1) when the potential function is bounded above,
not bounded below and the Markov kernel is not ergodic; and 2) when the
potential function is not bounded above, but the Markov kernel itself satisfies
a multiplicative drift condition.

core-collapse simulations of an $11.2 M_{\odot}$ star. By comparing one-(1D)
and two-dimensional(2D) results with those of 3D, we study how the increasing
spacial multi-dimensionality affects the postbounce supernova dynamics. The
calculations were performed with an energy-dependent treatment of the neutrino
transport that is solved by the isotropic diffusion source approximation
scheme. By performing a tracer-particle analysis, we show that the maximum
residency time of material in the gain region is shown to be longer for 3D due
to non-axisymmetric flow motions than 2D, which is one of advantageous aspects
of 3D models to obtain neutrino-driven explosions. Our results show that
convective matter motions below the gain radius become much more violent in 3D
than 2D, making the neutrino luminosity larger for 3D. Nevertheless the emitted
neutrino energies are made smaller due to the enhanced cooling. Our results
indicate whether these advantages for driving 3D explosions could or could not
overwhelm the disadvantages is sensitive to the employed numerical resolutions.
An encouraging finding is that the shock expansion tends to become more
energetic for models with finer resolutions. To draw a robust conclusion, 3D
simulations with much more higher numerical resolutions and also with more
advanced treatment of neutrino transport as well as of gravity is needed, which
could be hopefully practicable by utilizing forthcoming Petaflops-class
supercomputers.

which consists of a rapid rise followed by a slow exponential decay. However, a
study of 216 of the brightest flares on 161 pre-main sequence stars, observed
during the Chandra Orion-Ultradeep Project (COUP), showed that many flare
lightcurves depart from this typical morphology. While this can be attributed
to the superposition of multiple typical flares, we explore the possibility
that the time-variable eclipsing of flares by their host stars may also be an
important factor. We assume each flare is contained within a single, uniform
plasma density magnetic loop and specify the intrinsic variation of the flare's
emission measure with time. We consider rotational eclipse by the star itself,
but also by circumstellar discs and flare-associated prominences. Based on this
simple model, we generate a set of flares similar to those observed in the COUP
database. Many eclipses simply reduce the flare's maximum emission measure or
decay time. We conclude therefore that eclipses often pass undetected, but
usually have only a modest influence on the flare emission measure profile and
hence the derived loop lengths. We show that eclipsing can easily reproduce the
observed atypical flare morphologies. The number of atypical modelled flare
morphologies is however much less than that found in the COUP sample. The large
number of observed atypical flare morphologies, therefore, must be attributed
to other processes such as multiple flaring loops.

detector (SNSPD) are caused by the transition from a current-biased metastable
superconducting state to the normal state. Such a transition is triggered by
vortices crossing the thin film superconducting strip from one edge to another
due to the Lorentz force. Detector counts in SNSPDs may be caused by three
processes: (a) a single incident photon with energy sufficient to break enough
Cooper pairs to create a normal-state belt across the entire width of the strip
(direct photon count), (b) thermally induced single-vortex crossing in the
absence of photons (dark count), which at high bias currents releases the
energy sufficient to trigger the transition to the normal state in a belt
across the whole width of the strip, and (c) a single incident photon with
insufficient energy to create a normal-state belt but initiating a subsequent
single-vortex crossing, which provides the rest of the energy needed to create
the normal-state belt (vortex-assisted single photon count). We derive the
current dependence of the rate of vortex-assisted photon counts. The resulting
photon count rate has a plateau at high currents close to the critical current
and drops as a power-law with high exponent at lower currents. While the
magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane does not affect the formation of
hot spots by photons, it causes the rate of vortex crossings (with or without
photons) to increase. We show that by applying a magnetic field one may
characterize the energy barrier for vortex crossings and identify the origin of
dark counts and vortex-assisted photon counts.

mergers using the N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code
\textsc{Gadget}. The simulations include the effects of radiative cooling, star
formation and supernova feedback. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is implemented
using the SPH method. We present 32 simulations of binary mergers of disc
galaxies with mass ratios of 2:1 up to 100:1, whereby we have additionally
varied the initial magnetic field strengths, disc orientations and resolutions.
We investigate the amplification of a given initial magnetic field within the
galaxies and an ambient intergalactic medium (IGM) during the interaction. We
find that the magnetic field strengths of merger remnants with mass ratios up
to 10:1 saturate at a common value of several $\mu$G. For higher mass ratios,
the field strength saturates at lower values. The saturation values correspond
to the equipartition value of magnetic and turbulent energy density. The
initial magnetization, disc orientation and numerical resolution show only
minor effects on the saturation value of the magnetic field. We demonstrate
that a higher impact energy of the progenitor galaxies leads to a more
efficient magnetic field amplification. The magnetic and turbulent energy
densities are higher for larger companion galaxies, consistent with the higher
impact energy supplied to the system. We present a detailed study of the
evolution of the temperature and the bolometric X-ray luminosity within the
merging systems. Thereby we find that magnetic fields cause a more efficient
increase of the IGM temperature and the corresponding IGM X-ray luminosity
after the first encounter. However, the presence of magnetic fields does not
enhance the total X-ray luminosity. Generally, the final value of the X-ray
luminosity is even clearly lower for higher initial magnetic fields.

local universe, spanning -650 km/s < cz < 17,500 km/s and covering 517.0 square
degrees (7% of the full ALFALFA survey). The survey is sensitive to HI
absorption lines stronger than 7.7 mJy (8983 radio sources) and is 90% complete
for lines stronger than 11.0 mJy (7296 sources). The total redshift interval
sensitive to all damped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems (N_HI >= 2x10^20 cm^-2) is
Delta z = 7.0 (129 objects, assuming T_s = 100 K and covering fraction unity);
for super-DLAs (N_HI >= 2x10^21 cm^-2) it is Delta z= 128.2 (2353 objects). We
re-detect the intrinsic HI absorption line in UGC 6081 but detect no
intervening absorption line systems. We compute a 95% confidence upper limit on
the column density frequency distribution function f(N_HI,X) spanning four
orders of magnitude in column density, 10^19 (T_s/100 K)(1/f) cm^-2 < N_HI <
10^23 (T_s/100 K)(1/f) cm^-2, that is consistent with previous redshifted
optical damped Ly alpha surveys and the aggregate HI 21 cm emission in the
local universe. The detection rate is in agreement with extant observations.
This pilot survey suggests that an absorption line search of the complete
ALFALFA survey --- or any higher redshift, larger bandwidth, or more sensitive
survey, such as those planned for Square Kilometer Array pathfinders or a low
frequency lunar array --- will either make numerous detections or will set a
strong statistical lower limit on the typical spin temperature of neutral

dynamics of galactic systems without the need to invoke the existence of dark
matter, a prediction often appears regarding low acceleration systems: wherever
$a$ falls below $a_{0}$ one should expect a transition from the classical to
the modified gravity regime.This modified gravity regime will be characterised
by equilibrium velocities which become independent of distance, and which scale
with the fourth root of the total baryonic mass, $V^{4} \propto M$. The two
above conditions are the well known flat rotation curves and Tully-Fisher
relations of the galactic regime. Recently however, a similar phenomenology has
been hinted at, at the outskirts of Galactic globular clusters, precisely in
the region where $a<a_{0}$. Radial profiles of the projected velocity
dispersion have been observed to stop decreasing along Keplerian expectations,
and to level off at constant values beyond the radii where $a<a_{0}$. We have
constructed gravitational equilibrium dynamical models for a number of globular
clusters for which the above gravitational anomaly has been reported, using a
modified Newtonian force law which yields equilibrium velocities equivalent to
MOND. We find models can be easily constructed having an inner Newtonian region
and an outer modified gravity regime, which reproduce all observational
constraints, surface brightness profiles, total masses and line of sight
velocity dispersion profiles. Through the use of detailed single stellar
population models tuned individually to each of the globular clusters in
question, we derive estimates of the total masses for these systems.
Interestingly, we find that the asymptotic values of the velocity dispersion
profiles are consistent with scaling with the fourth root of the total masses,
as expected under modified gravity scenarios.

are inversely proportional to the quantity we define as the effective Hilbert

dimension of the entire available Hilbert space. Nevertheless, in the
semiclassical regime this effective Hilbert space dimension is in general
large, in which case even a chaotic environment with few degrees of freedom
produces decoherence without revivals. Moreover we show that in this regime the
environment leads the central system to equilibrate to the time average of its
reduced density matrix, which corresponds to a diagonal state in the
preferential energy eigenbasis. For the case of two uncoupled, initially
entangled central systems that interact with identical local quantum
environments with chaotic underlying classical dynamics, we show that in the

  We first begin by presenting a nice proof of the amalgamated product

classification of birational maps and some applications (Tits alternative,
non-simplicity...) Since any birational map can be written as a composition of
quadratic birational maps up to an automorphism of the complex projective
plane, we spend time on these special maps. Some questions of group theory are
evoked: the classification of the finite subgroups of the Cremona group and
related problems, the description of the automorphisms of the Cremona group and
the representations of some lattices in the Cremona group. The description of
the centralizers of discrete dynamical systems is an important problem in real
and complex dynamic, we make a state of art of this problem in the Cremona
group.
  Let $Z$ be a compact complex surface which carries an automorphism $f$ of
positive topological entropy. Either the Kodaira dimension of $Z$ is zero and
$f$ is conjugate to an automorphism on the unique minimal model of $Z$ which is
either a torus, or a K3 surface, or an Enriques surface, or $Z$ is a
non-minimal rational surface and $f$ is conjugate to a birational map of the
complex projective plane. We deal with results obtained in this last case:
construction of such automorphisms, dynamical properties (rotation domains...)

networks are found to divide naturally into communities of densely connected
individuals. Finding community structure is one of fundamental problems in
network science. Since Newman's suggestion of using \emph{modularity} as a
measure to qualify the goodness of community structures, many efficient methods
to maximize modularity have been proposed but without a guarantee of
optimality. In this paper, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms to the
modularity maximization problem with theoretical performance guarantees. The
first algorithm comes with a \emph{priori guarantee} that the modularity of
found community structure is within a constant factor of the optimal modularity
when the network has the power-law degree distribution. Despite being mainly of
theoretical interest, to our best knowledge, this is the first approximation
algorithm for finding community structure in networks. In our second algorithm,
we propose a \emph{sparse metric}, a substantially faster linear programming
method for maximizing modularity and apply a rounding technique based on this
sparse metric with a \emph{posteriori approximation guarantee}. Our experiments
show that the rounding algorithm returns the optimal solutions in most cases
and are very scalable, that is, it can run on a network of a few thousand nodes
whereas the LP solution in the literature only ran on a network of at most 235
nodes.

of two unequal mass C/O white dwarfs (WDs). After the dynamical phase of the
merger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading to
nearly solid-body rotation on a viscous timescale of 1e-4 to 1 yr, long before
significant cooling can occur. Due to heating during the dynamical and viscous
phases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, and
radially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.
  Following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near the
envelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convective
carbon-burning. If not, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the inner region of the
envelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of the
envelope, again yielding off-center burning. As a result, the long-term
evolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous
calculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventually
yielding a high-mass O/Ne WD or a collapse to a neutron star. During the
cooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near the
Eddington limit. Given the double WD merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, tens of
these ~1e38 erg/s sources should exist in a Milky Way-type galaxy.
  While the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physical
picture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previous
work. Furthermore, remaining uncertainties related to the convective structure
near the photosphere and mass loss during the thermal evolution may
significantly affect our conclusions. Thus, future work within the context of
the physical model presented here is required to better address the eventual
fate of double WD mergers, including those for which one or both of the
components is a He WD.

select powerful radio sources at high redshifts (z>~2). Typically restricted to
large-sky surveys and relatively bright radio flux densities, it has gradually
become possible to extend the USS search to sub-mJy levels, thanks to the
recent appearance of sensitive low-frequency radio facilities. Here a first
detailed analysis of the nature of the faintest USS sources is presented. By
using Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Very Large Array radio observations
of the Lockman Hole at 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz, a sample of 58 USS sources, with
610 MHz integrated fluxes above 100 microJy, is assembled. Deep infrared data
at 3.6 and 4.5 micron from the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume
Survey (SERVS) is used to reliably identify counterparts for 48 (83%) of these
sources, showing an average total magnitude of [3.6](AB)=19.8 mag.
Spectroscopic redshifts for 14 USS sources, together with photometric redshift
estimates, improved by the use of the deep SERVS data, for a further 19
objects, show redshifts ranging from z=0.1 to z=2.8, peaking at z~0.6 and
tailing off at high redshifts. The remaining 25 USS sources, with no redshift
estimate, include the faintest [3.6] magnitudes, with 10 sources undetected at
3.6 and 4.5 micron (typically [3.6]>22-23 mag, from local measurements), which
suggests the likely existence of higher redshifts among the sub-mJy USS
population. The comparison with the Square Kilometre Array Design Studies
Simulated Skies models indicate that Fanaroff-Riley type I radio sources and
radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei may constitute the bulk of the faintest USS
population, and raises the possibility that the high efficiency of the USS
technique for the selection of high redshift sources remains even at the
sub-mJy level.

dimensions, obtained on partitioning space into two regions. For trivial phases
without topological order, we argue that the entanglement entropy may be
obtained by integrating an `entropy density' over the partition boundary that
admits a gradient expansion in the curvature of the boundary. This constrains
the expansion of entanglement entropy as a function of system size, and points
to an even-odd dependence on dimensionality. For example, in contrast to the
familiar result in two dimensions, a size independent constant contribution to
the entanglement entropy can appear for trivial phases in any odd spatial
dimension. We then discuss phases with topological entanglement entropy (TEE)
that cannot be obtained by adding local contributions. We find that in three
dimensions there is just one type of TEE, as in two dimensions, that depends
linearly on the number of connected components of the boundary (the `zeroth
Betti number'). In D > 3 dimensions, new types of TEE appear which depend on
the higher Betti numbers of the boundary manifold. We construct generalized
toric code models that exhibit these TEEs and discuss ways to extract TEE in D

the smaller Euclidean area (rather than the intrinsic area). We give an example

derive a new lower bound for the ADM mass of a conformally flat, asymptotically

automated photometry of HII regions, to identify the regions and measure their
fluxes and sizes. A 10 {\sigma} detection level was used to exclude diffuse gas
fluctuations and star residuals after continuum subtraction. That selection
limit may result in missing some faint HII regions, but our catalog of 3691 HII
regions is still complete to a luminosity of LH{\alpha} = 10^34 erg/s. This is
five times fainter than the only previous CCD-based study which contained 967
objects in the NE half of M31. We determined the H{\alpha} luminosity function
(LF) by fitting a power law to luminosities larger than LH{\alpha} = 10^36.7
and determined a slope of 2.52\pm0.07. The in-arm and inter-arm LFs peak at
different luminosities but they have similar bright-end slopes. The inter- arm
regions are less populated (40% of total detected regions) and constitute only
14% of the total luminosity of LH{\alpha} = 5.6 /times 10^40 erg/s (after
extinction correction and considering 65% contribution from diffused ionized
gas). A star formation rate of 0.44 M\odot/yr was estimated from the H{\alpha}
total luminosity; this value is consistent with the determination from the
Spitzer 8 {\mu}m image. We removed all known and potential planetary nebulae,
yet we found a double peaked luminosity function. The inter-arm older
population suggests a starburst between 15 and 20 million years ago. This
result is in agreement with UV studies of the star formation history in M31
which found a star formation rate decrease in the recent past. We found a fair
spatial correlation between the HII regions and stellar clusters in selected

the sphere by curves of genus $g$, for example. However, the combinatorics of
some equally important $\mathfrak{S}_n$-factorization problems forces $k$
elements in $\{1,...,n\}$ to be distinguished. Examples of such problems
include the star factorization problem, for which $k=1,$ and the enumeration of
2-cell embeddings of dipoles with two distinguished edges
\cite{VisentinWieler:2007} associated with Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase
operators in Yang-Mills theory \cite{ConstableFreedmanHeadrick:2002}, for which
$k=2.$ Although distinguishing these elements obstructs the use of central
methods, these problems may be encoded algebraically in the centralizer of
$\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_n]$ with respect to the subgroup $\mathfrak{S}_{n-k}.$
We develop methods for studying these problems for $k=1,$ and demonstrate their
efficacy on the star factorization problem. In a subsequent paper
\cite{JacksonSloss:2011}, we consider a special case of the the above dipole
problem by means of these techniques.

[OII] emission features in the LRG spectra. The primarily old stellar
populations in the LRGs indicate that starburst driven outflows are unlikely to
explain the observed MgII absorbers at large distances from the LRGs. In
addition, the spectroscopic LRG sample allows us to derive a sensitive

simulations of this interaction that illuminate the long term dynamical

our simulations to model emission, we predict that the shock surrounding the

shock is likely to be detectable in X-ray emission. We construct an analytic

transmitted over links with high queue differentials, offers the promise of
throughput-optimal operation for a wide range of communication networks.
However, when the traffic load is low, due to the corresponding low queue
occupancy, backpressure scheduling/routing experiences long delays. This is
particularly of concern in intermittent encounter-based mobile networks which
are already delay-limited due to the sparse and highly dynamic network
connectivity. While state of the art mechanisms for such networks have proposed
the use of redundant transmissions to improve delay, they do not work well when
the traffic load is high. We propose in this paper a novel hybrid approach that
we refer to as backpressure with adaptive redundancy (BWAR), which provides the
best of both worlds. This approach is highly robust and distributed and does
not require any prior knowledge of network load conditions. We evaluate BWAR
through both mathematical analysis and simulations based on cell-partitioned
model. We prove theoretically that BWAR does not perform worse than traditional
backpressure in terms of the maximum throughput, while yielding a better delay
bound. The simulations confirm that BWAR outperforms traditional backpressure
at low load, while outperforming a state of the art encounter-routing scheme
(Spray and Wait) at high load.

present photometric and spectroscopic data for a pre-MS K5 star (1SWASP

Upper Cen-Lup subgroup of Sco-Cen at a kinematic distance of 128 pc. SuperWASP
and ASAS light curves for this star show a remarkably long, deep, and complex
eclipse event centered on 29 April 2007. At least 5 multi-day dimming events of
>0.5 mag are identified, with a >3.3 mag deep eclipse bracketed by two pairs of
~1 mag eclipses symmetrically occurring +-12 days and +-26 days before and
after. Hence, significant dimming of the star was taking place on and off over
at least a ~54 day period in 2007, and a strong >1 mag dimming event occurred
over a ~12 day span. We place a firm lower limit on the period of 850 days
(i.e. the orbital radius of the eclipser must be >1.7 AU and orbital velocity
must be <22 km/s). The shape of the light curve is similar to the lop-sided
eclipses of the Be star EE Cep. We suspect that this new star is being eclipsed
by a low-mass object orbited by a dense inner disk, girded by at least 3 dusty
rings of lower optical depth. Between these rings are at least two annuli of
near-zero optical depth (i.e. gaps), possibly cleared out by planets or moons,
depending on the nature of the secondary. For possible periods in the range
2.33-200 yr, the estimated total ring mass is ~8-0.4 Mmoon (if the rings have

  Pictorial Structures",,,,,"cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scene understanding remains a significant challenge in the computer vision
community. The visual psychophysics literature has demonstrated the importance
of interdependence among parts of the scene. Yet, the majority of methods in
computer vision remain local. Pictorial structures have arisen as a fundamental
parts-based model for some vision problems, such as articulated object
detection. However, the form of classical pictorial structures limits their
applicability for global problems, such as semantic pixel labeling. In this
paper, we propose an extension of the pictorial structures approach, called
pixel-support parts-sparse pictorial structures, or PS3, to overcome this
limitation. Our model extends the classical form in two ways: first, it defines
parts directly based on pixel-support rather than in a parametric form, and
second, it specifies a space of plausible parts-based scene models and permits
one to be used for inference on any given image. PS3 makes strides toward
unifying object-level and pixel-level modeling of scene elements. In this
report, we implement the first half of our model and rely upon external
knowledge to provide an initial graph structure for a given image. Our
experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the capability of this
new parts-based view of scene modeling.

Using the exact transfer-matrix method the transverse and longitudinal pressure

phase transition does not occur even in the widest tube, where the method just
loses its exactness, but the appearance of the dramatic change in the equation
of state and the longitudinal correlation function shows that the system
undergoes a structural change from a fluid to a solid-like order. The pressure

densities, while they are transverse in the vicinity of close packing density.
The transverse correlation function shows that the size of solid-like domains
grows exponentially with increasing pressure and the correlation length
diverges at close packing. It is managed to find an analytically solvable model
by expanding the contact distance up to first order. The approximate model,
which corresponds to the system of hard parallel rhombuses, behaves very

analytical tool to understand multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels

studies based on large dimensional RMT rely on the assumption that the transmit
correlation matrix is diagonal or the propagation channel matrix is Gaussian.
There is an increasing interest in the channels where the transmit correlation
matrices are generally nonnegative definite and the channel entries are
non-Gaussian. This class of channel models appears in several applications in
MIMO multiple access systems, such as small cell networks (SCNs). To address
these problems, we use the generalized Lindeberg principle to show that the
Stieltjes transforms of this class of random matrices with Gaussian or
non-Gaussian independent entries coincide in the large dimensional regime. This
result permits to derive the deterministic equivalents (e.g., the Stieltjes

from the known results developed for Gaussian MIMO channels, and is of great
importance in characterizing the spectral efficiency of SCNs.

privacy and security in a cloud computing environment. In cloud, user's data is
stored in one or more remote server(s) which poses more security challenges for
the system. One of the most important concerns is to protect user's sensitive
information from other users and hackers that may cause data leakage in cloud
storage. Having this security challenge in mind, this paper focuses on the
development of a more secure cloud environment, to determine the trust of the
service requesting authorities by using a novel VM (Virtual Machine) monitoring
system. Moreover, this research aims towards proposing a new trusted and
collaborative agent-based two-tier framework, titled WAY (Who Are You?), to
protect cloud resources. The framework can be used to provide security in
network, infrastructure, as well as data storage in a heterogeneous cloud
platform. If the trust updating policy is based on network activities, then the
framework can provide network security. Similarly, it provides storage security
by monitoring unauthorized access activities by the Cloud Service Users (CSU).
Infrastructure security can be provided by monitoring the use of privileged
instructions within the isolated VMs. The uniqueness of the proposed security
solution lies in the fact that it ensures security and privacy both at the
service provider level as well as at the user level in a cloud environment.

stellar orbital eccentricity for a sample of solar-neighbour halo stars. Two
types of static, spherical gravitational potentials are adopted to define the
eccentricity e for given energy E and angular momentum L, such as an isochrone
potential and a Navarro-Frenk-White potential that can serve as two extreme
ends covering in-between any realistic potential of the Milky Way halo. The
solar-neighbour eccentricity distribution \Delta N(e) is then formulated, based
on a static distribution function of the form f(E,L) in which the velocity
anisotropy parameter \beta monotonically increases in the radial direction away
from the galaxy center, such that beta is below unity (near isotropic velocity
dispersion) in the central region and asymptotically approaches \sim 1
(radially anisotropic velocity dispersion) in the far distant region of the
halo. We find that \Delta N(e) sensitively depends upon the radial profile of
\beta, and this sensitivity is used to constrain such profile in comparison
with some observational properties of \Delta N_{obs}(e) recently reported by
Carollo et al. (2010). Especially, the linear e-distribution and the fraction
of higher-e stars for their sample of solar-neighbour inner-halo stars rule out
a constant profile of \beta, contrary to the opposite claim by Bond et al.
(2010). Our constraint of \beta \lesssim 0.5 at the galaxy center indicates
that the violent relaxation that has acted on the inner halo is effective
within a scale radius of \sim 10 kpc from the galaxy center. We discuss that
our result would help understand the formation and evolution of the Milky Way
halo.

antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition in
Fe49(Rh0.93Pd0.07)51 has been constructed using resistivity measurements under
simultaneous application of magnetic field (up to 8 Tesla) and pressure (up to
20 kbar). Temperature dependence of resistivity ({\rho}-T) shows that with
increasing pressure, the width of the transition and the extent of hysteresis
decreases whereas with the application of magnetic field it increases.
Consistent with existing literature the first order transition temperature (TN)
increases with the application of external pressure (~ 7.3 K/ kbar) and
decreases with magnetic field (~ - 12.8 K/Tesla). Exploiting these opposing
trends, resistivity under simultaneous application of magnetic field and
pressure is used to distinguish the relative effect of temperature, magnetic
field and pressure on disorder broadened first order transition. For this a set
of H and P values are chosen for which TN (H1, P1) = TN (H2, P2). Measurements
for such combinations of H and P show that the temperature dependence of
resistivity is similar i.e. the broadening (in temperature) of transition as
well as extent of hysteresis remains independent of H and P. The transition
width decreases exponentially with increasing temperature. Isothermal
magnetoresistance measurement under various constant pressure show that even
though the critical field required for AFM-FM transition depends on applied
pressure, the hysteresis as well as transition width (in magnetic field) both
remains independent of pressure, consistent with our conclusions drawn from
{\rho}-T measurements.

optical and dc electric fields. Here we report the X-ray writing of
high-qualitysuperconducting regions, derived from defect ordering, in the
superoxygenated layered cuprate, La2CuO4+y. Irradiation of a poor
superconductor prepared by rapid thermal quenching results first in growth of
ordered regions, with an enhancement of superconductivity becoming visible only
after a waiting time, as is characteristic of other systems such as
ferroelectrics, where strain must be accommodated for order to become extended.
However, in La2CuO4+y, we are able to resolve all aspects of the growth of
(oxygen) intercalant order, including an extraordinary excursion from low to
high and back to low anisotropy of the ordered regions. We can also clearly
associate the onset of high quality superconductivity with defect ordering in
two dimensions. Additional experiments with small beams demonstrate a
photoresist-free, single-step strategy for writing functional materials.

physics. Many different operator algebras exist for example for a theory of
quantum mechanics. In Loop Quantum Gravity only two algebras have been
introduced until now. In the project about 'Algebras of Quantum Variables (AQV)
for LQG' the known holonomy-flux *-algebra and the Weyl C*-algebra will be
modified and a set of new algebras will be proposed and studied. The idea of
the construction of these algebras is to establish a finite set of operators,
which generates (in the sense of Woronowicz, Schm\""udgen and Inoue) the
different O*- or C*-algebras of quantum gravity and to use inductive limits of
these algebras. In the Loop Quantum Gravity approach usually the basic
classical variables are connections and fluxes. Studying the three constraints
appearing in the canonical quantisation of classical general relativity in the
ADM-formalism some other variables like curvature appear. Consequently the main
difficulty of a quantisation of gravity is to find a suitable replacement of
the set of elementary classical variables and constraints. The algebra of
quantum gravity is supposed to be generated by a set of the operators
associated to holonomies, fluxes and in some cases even the curvature. There
are two reasonable choices for this algebra: The set of constraints of Quantum
Gravity are contained in or at least the constraints are affilliated with this
algebra. Secondly, the algebra of quantum variables is said to be physical if
it contains complete observables. In the project of 'Algebras of Quantum
Variables for LQG' different algebras will be studied with respect to the
property of being a physical algebra. Furthermore the existence of KMS-states
on these algebras will be argued.
