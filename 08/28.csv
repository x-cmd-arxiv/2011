collinear cluster tripartition is carried out within the framework of the model
based on the dinuclear system concept. The yield of fission products is
calculated using the statistical model based on the driving potentials for the
fissionable system. The minima of potential energy of the decaying system
correspond to the charge numbers of the products which are produced with large
probabilities in the sequential fission (partial case of the collinear cluster
tripartition) of the compound nucleus. The realization of this mechanism
supposes the asymmetric fission channel as the first stage of sequential
mechanism. It is shown that only the use of the driving potential calculated by
the binding energies with the shell correction allows us to explain the yield
of the true ternary fission products. The theoretical model is applied to
research collinear cluster tripartition in the reaction $^{235}$U(n$_{\rm
th}$,f). Calculations showed that in the first stage of this fission reaction,
the isotopes $^{82}$Ge and $^{154}$Nd are formed with relatively large
probabilities and in the second stage of sequential fission of the isotope Nd
mainly Ni and Ge are formed. This is in agreement with the yield of the isotope
$^{68}$Ni which is observed as the product of the collinear cluster
tripartition in the experiment.

received signal strength, interference from simultaneous transmissions, and
available coding-modulation schemes. Rate allocation is a key problem in
wireless network design, but a very challenging problem because: (i) wireless
interference is global, i.e., a transmission interferes all other simultaneous
transmissions, and (ii) the rate-power relation is non-convex and
non-continuous, where the discontinuity is due to limited number of
coding-modulation choices in practical systems. In this paper, we propose a
distributed power control and coding-modulation adaptation algorithm using
annealed Gibbs sampling, which achieves throughput optimality in an arbitrary
network topology. We consider a realistic
Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio (SINR) based interference model, and
assume continuous power space and finite rate options (coding-modulation
choices). Our algorithm first decomposes network-wide interference to local
interference by properly choosing a ""neighborhood"" for each transmitter and
bounding the interference from non-neighbor nodes. The power update policy is
then carefully designed to emulate a Gibbs sampler over a Markov chain with a
continuous state space. We further exploit the technique of simulated annealing
to speed up the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal power and
coding-modulation configuration. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

transit time probability distributions in a deterministic manner, considering
advective-dispersive transport in steady velocity fields. In a first step, we
propose to model the statistical distribution of groundwater age at aquifer
scale by means of the classical advection-dispersion equation for a
conservative and nonreactive tracer, associated to proper boundary conditions.
The evaluated function corresponds to the density of probability of the random
variable age, age being defined as the time elapsed since the water particles
entered the aquifer. An adjoint backward model is introduced to characterize
the life expectancy distribution, life expectancy being the time remaining
before leaving the aquifer. By convolution of these two distributions,
groundwater transit time distributions, from inlet to outlet, are fully defined
for the entire aquifer domain. In a second step, an accurate and efficient
method is introduced to simulate the transit time distribution at discharge
zones. By applying the reservoir theory to advective-dispersive aquifer
systems, we demonstrate that the discharge zone transit time distribution can
be evaluated if the internal age probability distribution is known. The
reservoir theory also applies to internal life expectancy probabilities
yielding the recharge zone life expectancy distribution. Internal groundwater
volumes are finally identified with respect to age and transit time. One- and
two-dimensional theoretical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed
mathematical models, and make inferences on the effect of aquifer structure and
macro-dispersion on the distributions of age, life expectancy and transit time.

model are derived, providing insights on how to relate exchange and storage
coefficients to the volumetric density of the high-permeability medium. It is
shown that porosity-weighted storage and exchange coefficients are needed when
handling highly heterogeneous systems - such as karstic aquifers - using
equivalent dual-porosity models. The sensitivity of these coefficients is
illustrated by means of numerical experiments with theoretical karst systems.
The presented 1-D dual-porosity analytical model is used to reproduce the
hydraulic responses of reference 3-D karst aquifers, modelled by a discrete
single-continuum approach. Under various stress conditions, simulation results
show the relations between the dual-porosity model coefficients and the
structural features of the discrete single-continuum model. The calibration of
the equivalent 1-D analytical dual-porosity model on reference hydraulic
responses confirms the dependence of the exchange coefficient with the karstic
network density. The use of the analytical model could also point out some
fundamental structural properties of the karstic network that rule the shape of
the hydraulic responses, such as density and connectivity.

The method (Le Loc'h and Galli 1994) is based on the idea of truncating at

derive a new numerical algorithm for such cases, which holds for all positive

the original function $G(v)$ is given by the product of a power $v^{\beta-1}$
and a polynomial in $v$. We test the algorithm numerically for very small
positive $\beta$, $\beta=10^{-6}$ obtaining numerical results that imitate the
Dirac delta function $\delta(v)$. We also devolve the published MSTW2008LO
gluon distribution at virtuality $Q^2=5$ GeV$^2$ down to the lower virtuality
$Q^2=1.69$ GeV$^2$. For devolution, $ \beta$ is negative, giving rise to
inverse Laplace transforms that are distributions and not proper functions.

considered demand-proportional resource provisioning schemes, where servers are
turned on/off according to the load of requests.
  Most existing work considers instantaneous (Internet) requests only, which
are explicitly or implicitly assumed to be delay-sensitive. On the other hand,
in datacenters, there exist a vast amount of delay-tolerant jobs, such as
background/maintainance jobs. In this paper, we explicitly differentiate
delay-sensitive jobs and delay tolerant jobs. We focus on the problem of using
delay-tolerant jobs to fill the extra capacity of datacenters, referred to as
trough/valley filling. Giving a higher priority to delay-sensitive jobs, our
schemes complement to most existing demand-proportional resource provisioning
schemes. Our goal is to design intelligent trough filling mechanisms that are
energy efficient and also achieve good delay performance. Specifically, we
propose two joint dynamic speed scaling and traffic shifting schemes, one
subgradient-based and the other queue-based. Our schemes assume little
statistical information of the system, which is usually difficult to obtain in
practice. In both schemes, energy cost saving comes from dynamic speed scaling,
statistical multiplexing, electricity price diversity, and service efficiency
diversity. In addition, good delay performance is achieved in the queue-based
scheme via load shifting and capacity allocation based on queue conditions.
Practical issues that may arise in datacenter networks are considered,
including capacity and bandwidth constraint, service agility constraint, and
load shifting cost. We use both artificial and real datacenter traces to
evaluate the proposed schemes.

postulated in the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, but arises dynamically
(relaxation to quantum equilibrium). These simulations were done for a particle
in a two-dimensional box whose wave-function obeys the non-relativistic
Schroedinger equation and is therefore scalar. The chaotic nature of the de
Broglie-Bohm trajectories, thanks to the nodes of the wave-function which act
as vortices, is crucial for a fast relaxation to quantum equilibrium. For
spinors, we typically do not expect any node. However, in the case of the Dirac
equation, the de Broglie-Bohm velocity field has vorticity even in the absence
of nodes. This observation raises the question of the origin of relaxation to
quantum equilibrium for fermions. In this article, we provide numerical
evidence to show that Dirac particles also undergo relaxation, by simulating
the evolution of various non-equilibrium distributions for two-dimensional
systems (the 2D Dirac oscillator and the Dirac particle in a spherical 2D box).
