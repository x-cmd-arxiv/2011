have proven useful tools in the study of quantum critical systems. Here we lay
out a general, unified formalism of GSF and QRG; specifically, we propose a
method to calculate GSF through QRG, obviating the need for calculating or
approximating ground states. This method thus enhances characterization of
quantum criticality as well as scaling analysis of relevant properties with
system size. We illustrate the formalism in the one-dimensional Ising model in
a transverse field and the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model.

feature in the NIST (FIPS 186-2) and SECG standards for use in elliptic curve
cryptography. Their form is such that modular reduction is extremely efficient,
thus making them an attractive choice for modular multiplication
implementation. However, the issue of residue multiplication efficiency seems
to have been overlooked. Asymptotically, using a cyclic rather than a linear
convolution, residue multiplication modulo a Mersenne number is twice as fast
as integer multiplication; this property does not hold for prime GMNs, unless
they are of Mersenne's form. In this work we exploit an alternative
generalisation of Mersenne numbers for which an analogue of the above property
--- and hence the same efficiency ratio --- holds, even at bitlengths for which
schoolbook multiplication is optimal, while also maintaining very efficient
reduction. Moreover, our proposed primes are abundant at any bitlength, whereas
GMNs are extremely rare. Our multiplication and reduction algorithms can also
be easily parallelised, making our arithmetic particularly suitable for
hardware implementation. Furthermore, the field representation we propose also
naturally protects against side-channel attacks, including timing attacks,
simple power analysis and differential power analysis, which is essential in
many cryptographic scenarios, in constrast to GMNs.

activates, because of its high content in quartzite, the generation of a

generally at a state of an oscillating stress load. Therefore, large EQs which
occur at the peaks of the stress load must coincide with the peaks of the
generated piezoelectric potential. In this work a physical mechanism is
postulated that accounts for the latter hypothesis. The postulated model is
statistically tested by comparing the time of occurrence of 280 large EQs
(Ms>5.0R) which occurred during the period from 2003 to 2011, to the same
period of time Earth's electric field registered at ATH (Athens) and PYR

the oscillating component of T = 1 day and for both the E - W and N - S
directions. The statistical results indicate that the postulated model does not
behave randomly. Instead, it represents a smooth normal distribution which
peaks on the zero deviation in time between the time of occurrence of the large
EQs and the amplitude peaks of the Earth's oscillating electric field.
Therefore, the proposed physical model is an acceptable one and can be used for
the finer refinement of the prediction of the occurrence time of a large EQ

that it can be used on a computational domain with excised regions for a black

accuracy for the finite difference schemes. We perform convergence tests for

similar accuracies as VW with 2^14 hashed values per data point.
  We demonstrate that the preprocessing cost of b-bit minwise hashing is
roughly on the same order of magnitude as the data loading time. Furthermore,
by using a GPU, the preprocessing cost can be reduced to a small fraction of

  Minwise hashing has been widely used in industry, at least in the context of

permutations by (e.g.,) universal hashing. In other words, there is no need to
store the permutation matrix. In this paper, we empirically verify this
practice, by demonstrating that even using the simplest 2-universal hashing

famous Hoag's Object, a peculiar ring galaxy with a central roundish core. The
nature of Hoag's Object is still under controversial discussion. Previous
studies demonstrated that a major accretion event that took place at least 2-3
Gyr ago can account for the observational evidence. However, the role of
internal nonlinear mechanisms in forming the outer ring was not yet completely
ruled out. These new data, together with HI and optical information from the
literature, are used to demonstrate that Hoag's Object is a relatively isolated
system surrounded by a luminous quasi-spiral pattern and a massive, low-density
HI disc. The main stellar body is an old, mildly triaxial elliptical galaxy
with very high angular momentum. We review previous formation scenarios of
Hoag's Object in light of the new data and conclude that the peculiar
morphology could not represent a late phase in barred early-type galaxies
evolution. In addition, no observational evidence supports late merging events
in the evolution of the galaxy, although further tests are required before
safely dismissing this idea. We propose a new scenario where the elliptical
core formed in the early Universe with the HI disc forming shortly after the
core by prolonged ""cold"" accretion of primordial gas from the intergalactic
medium. The low gas density does not allow intense star formation to occur
everywhere in the disc, but only along a tightly wound spiral pattern of
enhanced density induced by the triaxial gravitational potential.

interacts with the environment."" The former follows from the quantum Bayes
Theorem we derive. We show that because of the long-range entanglement created
by cosmological inflation, the cosmic entropy decreases exponentially rather
than linearly with the number of bits of information observed, so that a given
observer can reduce entropy by much more than the amount of information her
brain can store. Indeed, we argue that as long as inflation has occurred in a
non-negligible fraction of the volume, almost all sentient observers will find
themselves in a post-inflationary low-entropy Hubble volume, and we humans have
no reason to be surprised that we do so as well, which solves the so-called
inflationary entropy problem. An arguably worse problem for unitary cosmology
involves gamma-ray-burst constraints on the ""Big Snap"", a fourth cosmic
doomsday scenario alongside the ""Big Crunch"", ""Big Chill"" and ""Big Rip"", where
an increasingly granular nature of expanding space modifies our life-supporting
laws of physics.

quantum gravity approximation that the Einstein tensor equals the quantum
expectation value of the stress-energy tensor, and how problems with recent
attempts to explain dark energy as gravitational backreaction from
super-horizon scale fluctuations can be understood as a failure of this

quiescence has an amplitude of ~0.025 mag. The quality of the Kepler data is
such that we can test vigorously the models for accretion disk dynamics that
have been emerging in the past several years. The SC data for V344 Lyr are
consistent with the model that two physical sources yield positive superhumps:
early in the superoutburst, the superhump signal is generated by viscous
dissipation within the periodically flexing disk, but late in the
superoutburst, the signal is generated as the accretion stream bright spot
sweeps around the rim of the non-axisymmetric disk. The disk superhumps are
roughly anti-phased with the stream/late superhumps. The V344 Lyr data also
reveal negative superhumps arising from accretion onto a tilted disk precessing
in the retrograde direction, and suggest that negative superhumps may appear
during the decline of DN outbursts. The period of negative superhumps has a
positive dP/dt in between outbursts.

sufficient gas is driven towards the BH, gravitational instabilities
generically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. The lopsided
stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuel
rapid BH growth. Here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'
invoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has
characteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the
torus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are
substantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the
vertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and
warps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly
attributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:
misalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and
turbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN
luminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations
of gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities
in AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent. We argue that it is not
possible to reproduce these observations and the observed column density (N_H)
distribution without a clumpy gas distribution, but allowing for clumping on
small scales the predicted N_H distribution is in good agreement with
observations from 10^20-27 cm^-2. We examine how N_H scales with galaxy and AGN
properties, and find that AGN feedback may be necessary to explain some trends
with luminosity and/or redshift. The torus is not merely a bystander or passive
fuel source for accretion, but is itself the mechanism driving accretion.

(8.4+/-0.5)x10^16cm^-2. The relation scales linearly for possible higher
excitation temperatures. In the context of a model with a molecular ring that
connects the two nuclei in Arp220, we estimate the H2 gas density to be
~f_V^-0.5 x (1-4)x10^3, (f_V: volume filling factor). In addition to NH3, our
ATCA data show an absorption feature adjacent in frequency to the NH3 (3,3)
line. If we interpret the line to be from the OH ^2Pi_3/2 J=9/2 F=4-4
transition, it would have a linewidth, systemic velocity, and apparent optical
depth similar to what we detect in the NH3 lines. If this association with OH
is correct, it marks the first detection of the highly excited (~511K above
ground state) ^2Pi_3/2 J=9/2 F=4-4 OH line in an extragalactic object.

belt asteroids yet exhibit dust ejection like comets. In order to constrain
their physical and orbital properties we searched the Thousand Asteroid Light
Curve Survey (TALCS; Masiero et al. 2009) for additional candidates using two
diagnostics: tail and coma detection. This was the most sensitive MBC survey
effort to date, extending the search from MBCs with H~18 (D~1 km) to H~21
(D~150 m).
  We fit each of the 924 TALCS objects to a PSF model incorporating both a coma
and nuclear component to measure the fractional contribution of the coma to the
total surface brightness. We determined the significance of the coma detection
using the same algorithm on a sample of comparable null detections. We did not
identify any MBC candidates with this technique to a sensitivity limit on the
order of cometary mass loss rate of about 0.1 kg/s. Our tail detection
algorithm identified statistically significant flux in a segmented annulus
around the candidate object. We show that the technique can detect tail
activity throughout the asteroid belt to the level of the currently known MBCs.
Although we did not identify any MBC candidates with this technique, we find a
statistically significant detection of faint activity in the entire ensemble of
TALCS asteroids. This suggests that many main belt asteroids are active at very
low levels.
  We set 90% upper confidence limits on the number distribution of MBCs as a
function of absolute magnitude, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination.

local standard of rest velocities (-130 to 100 km -1). An analysis of this
absorption yields HF abundances relative to H2 of ~1.3 {\times}10-8, in most

Interestingly, we also find velocity intervals in which the HF spectrum shows
strong absorption features that are not present, or are very weak, in spectra
of other molecules, such as 13CO (1-0) and CS (2-1). HF absorption reveals
components of diffuse clouds with small extinction that can be studied for the

their joint soft X-ray (0.1-2.4 keV) and far-infrared ({\lambda} = 60-100

reflect the orbital motion in the gravitational potential of the host galaxy,

the CO line width and hard (0.3-8 keV from Chandra and XMM-Newton) X-ray

interactions. I investigate the tidal heating of each WD, parameterized in
terms of its tidal Q parameter. Assuming that the heating can be radiated
efficiently, the current luminosities are consistent with Q_1=7*10^{10} and
Q_2=2*10^7, for the He and C/O WDs, respectively. Conversely, if the observed
luminosities are merely from the cooling of the WDs, these estimated values of
Q represent upper limits. A large Q_1 for the He WD means its spin velocity
will be slower than that expected if it was tidally locked, which, since the
binary is eclipsing, may be measurable via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.
After one year, gravitational wave emission shifts the time of eclipses by 5.5
s, but tidal interactions cause the orbit to shrink more rapidly, changing the
time by up to an additional 0.3 s after a year. Future eclipse timing
measurements may therefore infer the degree of tidal locking.

nonoscillatory correction to the gravitational-wave polarizations. It arises
from gravitational waves that are sourced by gravitational waves. Previous
considerations of the nonlinear memory effect have focused on quasicircular
binaries. Here, I consider the nonlinear memory from Newtonian orbits with
arbitrary eccentricity. Expressions for the waveform polarizations and
spin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes are derived for elliptic, hyperbolic,
parabolic, and radial orbits. In the hyperbolic, parabolic, and radial cases
the nonlinear memory provides a 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) correction to the
leading-order waveforms. This is in contrast to the elliptical and
quasicircular cases, where the nonlinear memory corrects the waveform at
leading (0PN) order. This difference in PN order arises from the fact that the
memory builds up over a short ""scattering"" time scale in the hyperbolic case,
as opposed to a much longer radiation-reaction time scale in the elliptical
case. The nonlinear memory corrections presented here complete our knowledge of
the leading-order (Peters-Mathews) waveforms for elliptical orbits. These
calculations are also relevant for binaries with quasicircular orbits in the
present epoch which had, in the past, large eccentricities. Because the
nonlinear memory depends sensitively on the past evolution of a binary, I
discuss the effect of this early-time eccentricity on the value of the
late-time memory in nearly circularized binaries. I also discuss the
observability of large ""memory jumps"" in a binary's past that could arise from
its formation in a capture process. Lastly, I provide estimates of the
signal-to-noise ratio of the linear and nonlinear memories from hyperbolic and
parabolic binaries.

galaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. In this
Letter, we report \emph{Herschel} PACS-100$\mu$m, PACS-160$\mu$m and
\emph{Spitzer} MIPS-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopically
GALEX-selected LAEs at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. Five out of ten and one out of
two LAEs are detected in, at least, one PACS band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,
respectively. These measurements have a great importance given that they allow
us to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of LAEs from direct FIR
observations. MIPS-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine IR properties of
the PACS-undetected LAEs. We obtain that mid-IR/FIR detected star-forming (SF)
LAEs at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $A_{1200\AA}$
$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of A$_{1200\textrm{\AA}}$$\sim$1.1. This
range broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $A_{1200\AA}$ $\lesssim$2.5 when
considering those LAEs at z$\sim$1.0. Only one SF LAE is undetected both in
MIPS-24$\mu$m and PACS, with $A_{1200\AA}$ $\lesssim$0.75. These results seem
to be larger than those reported for high-redshift LAEs and, therefore,
although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out that
low-redshift LAEs are dustier than high-redshift ones. However, the diverse
methods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

library, contain regular expression matchers. Rather than first translating a
regular expression into a deterministic finite automaton, such implementations
typically match the regular expression on the fly. Thus they can be seen as
virtual machines interpreting the regular expression much as if it were a
program with some non-deterministic constructs such as the Kleene star. We
formalize this implementation technique for regular expression matching using
operational semantics. Specifically, we derive a series of abstract machines,
moving from the abstract definition of matching to increasingly realistic
machines. First a continuation is added to the operational semantics to
describe what remains to be matched after the current expression. Next, we
represent the expression as a data structure using pointers, which enables
redundant searches to be eliminated via testing for pointer equality. From
there, we arrive both at Thompson's lockstep construction and a machine that
performs some operations in parallel, suitable for implementation on a large
number of cores, such as a GPU. We formalize the parallel machine using process
algebra and report some preliminary experiments with an implementation on a
graphics processor using CUDA.

between the effective widths of Fourier transform pairs of variables (i.e.
conjugate variables). We note that the HUP is not a quantum mechanical
measurement principle per se. We introduce the Quantum Mechanical equivalent of
the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem of Fourier Transform theory, and show that
it is a better principle to describe the measurement limitations of Quantum
Mechanics. We show that Brillouin zones in Solid State physics are a
manifestation of the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem at the quantum level. By
comparison with other fields where Fourier Transform theory is used, we propose
that we need to discern between measurement limitations and inherent
limitations when interpreting the impact of the HUP on the nature of the
quantum level. We further propose that while measurement limitations result in
our perception of indeterminism at the quantum level, there is no evidence that
there are any inherent limitations at the quantum level, based on the

age, gender and sexual activity-group. Developing this model and a means to

  We extend the development of a sexual mixing matrix for the population, based

consider a stochastic mixing matrix framework which allows us to jointly
estimate unknown attributes and parameters of the mixing matrix along with the
parameters involved in the calibration of the HPV epidemic model. This matrix
describes the sexual interactions between members of the population under study
and relies on several quantities which are a-priori unknown. The Bayesian model
developed allows one to estimate jointly the HPV-6 and HPV-11 epidemic model
parameters such as the probability of transmission, HPV incubation period,
duration of infection, duration of genital warts treatment, duration of
immunity, the probability of seroconversion, per gender, age-group and sexual

assortativity. We conclude with simulation studies on synthetic and actual data

average subthreshold slope, the nature of the output characteristics and the
immunity against the DIBL effects. We demonstrate that if appropriate
work-functions are chosen for the gate materials on the source side and the
drain side, the tunnel field effect transistor shows a significantly improved

Field Effect Transistor with a high-k gate dielectric to show an overall
improvement in the characteristics of the device along with achieving a good
on-current and an excellent average subthreshold slope. The results show that
the DMG technique can be applied to TFETs with different channel materials,

result to the general framework of shift-invariant subspaces. We prove that
time encoding machines may be considered as non-uniform sampling devices, where
time locations are unknown a priori. Using this fact, we show that perfect
representation and reconstruction of a signal with a time encoding machine is
possible whenever this device satisfies some density property. We prove that
this method is robust under timing quantization, and therefore can lead to the
design of simple and energy efficient sampling devices.

algorithm's output to small change in the training dataset (e.g. deletion or
replacement of a single training sample). Such conditions have recently been
shown to be more powerful to characterize learnability in the general learning
setting under i.i.d. samples where uniform convergence is not necessary for
learnability, but where stability is both sufficient and necessary for
learnability. We here show that similar stability conditions are also
sufficient for online learnability, i.e. whether there exists a learning
algorithm such that under any sequence of examples (potentially chosen
adversarially) produces a sequence of hypotheses that has no regret in the
limit with respect to the best hypothesis in hindsight. We introduce online
stability, a stability condition related to uniform-leave-one-out stability in
the batch setting, that is sufficient for online learnability. In particular we
show that popular classes of online learners, namely algorithms that fall in
the category of Follow-the-(Regularized)-Leader, Mirror Descent, gradient-based
methods and randomized algorithms like Weighted Majority and Hedge, are
guaranteed to have no regret if they have such online stability property. We
provide examples that suggest the existence of an algorithm with such stability
condition might in fact be necessary for online learnability. For the more
restricted binary classification setting, we establish that such stability
condition is in fact both sufficient and necessary. We also show that for a
large class of online learnable problems in the general learning setting,
namely those with a notion of sub-exponential covering, no-regret online
algorithms that have such stability condition exists.

erratic and uncontrollable behavior. To a large extend, this is correct. At
first approximation the difference between real price changes and the random
walk model is too small to be detected using traditional time series analysis.
However, we show in the following that this difference between real financial
time series and random walks, as small as it is, is detectable using modern
statistical multivariate analysis, with several triggers encoded in trading
systems. This kind of analysis are based on methods widely used in nuclear
physics, with large samples of data and advanced statistical inference.
Considering the movements of the Euro future contract at high frequency, we
show that a part of the non-random content of this series can be inferred,
namely the trend-following content depending on volatility ranges. Of course,
this is not a general proof of statistical inference, as we focus on one
particular example and the generality of the process can not be claimed.
Therefore, we produce other examples on a completely different markets, largely
uncorrelated to the Euro future, namely the DAX and Cacao future contracts. The
same procedure is followed using a trading system, based on the same
ingredients. We show that similar results can be obtained and we conclude that
this is an evidence that some invariants, as encoded in our system, have been
identified. They provide a kind of quantification of the non-random content of

two clear signals of the process: the ""pure muon"" from $\bar{\nu}_e e \to

observation of only one pure muon or contained lollipop event essentially
signals discovery of the resonance, even if the expected event numbers are
small. We also evaluate the total event rates of the Glashow resonance from the

elongated particles in quasistatic equilibrium is complex due to the combined
effects of local nematic ordering of the particles and orientations of contacts
between particles. We show that particle elongation affects force distributions
and force/fabric anisotropy via various local structures allowed by steric
exclusions and the requirement of force balance. As a result, the force
distributions become increasingly broader as particles become more elongated.
Interestingly, the weak force network transforms from a passive stabilizing
agent with respect to strong force chains to an active force-transmitting
network for the whole system. The strongest force chains are carried by
side/side contacts oriented along the principal stress direction.

localisation zones. To do so, a local/global technique is devised where the
global (slave) problem (far from the zones undergoing severe damage and
cracking) is solved for in a reduced space computed by the classical Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition, while the local (master) degrees of freedom
(associated with the part of the structure where most of the damage is taking
place) are fully resolved. Both domains are coupled through a local/global
technique. This method circumvents the difficulties associated with model order
reduction for the simulation of highly non-linear mechanical failure and offers
an alternative or complementary approach to the development of multiscale
fracture simulators.

intergranular lanes is dominated by Hall drift in the photosphere-lower
chromosphere region ($\lesssim 1 Mm$). In the internetwork regions, Hall drift
dominates above $0.25 Mm$ in the photosphere and below $2.5 Mm$ in the
chromosphere. Although Hall drift does not cause any dissipation in the ambient
plasma, it can destabilise the flux tubes and magnetic elements in the presence
of azimuthal shear flow. The physical mechanism of this instability is quite
simple: the shear flow twists the radial magnetic field and generates azimuthal
field; torsional oscillations of the azimuthal field in turn generates the
radial field completing feedback loop. The maximum growth rate of Hall
instability is proportional to the absolute value of the shear gradient and is
dependent on the ambient diffusivity. The diffusivity also determines the most
unstable wavelength which is smaller for weaker fields.
  We apply the result of local stability analysis to the network and
internetwork magnetic elements and show that the maximum growth rate for
kilogauss field occurs around $0.5 Mm$ and decreases with increasing altitude.
However, for a $120 G$ field, the maximum growth rate remains almost constant
in the entire photosphere-lower chromosphere except in a small region of lower
photosphere. For shear flow gradient $\sim 0.01 s^{-1}$, the Hall growth time
is 10 minute near the footpoint. Therefore, network fields are likely to be
unstable in the photosphere, whereas internetwork fields could be unstable in
the entire photosphere-chromosphere. Thus the Hall instability can play an
important role in generating low frequency turbulence which can heat the
chromosphere.

disturbs carrier injection. We therefore used an electrical training process to
obtain ferroelectric control of the diode polarity where, by changing the
polarization direction using an external bias, we could switch the transport
characteristics between forward and reverse diodes. Our system is characterized
with a rectangular polarization hysteresis loop, with which we confirmed that
the diode polarity switching occurred at the ferroelectric coercive voltage.
Moreover, we observed a simultaneous switching of the diode polarity and the
associated photovoltaic response dependent on the ferroelectric domain
configurations. Our detailed study suggests that the polarization charge can
affect the Schottky barrier at the ferroelectric/metal interfaces, resulting in
a modulation of the interfacial carrier injection. The amount of
polarization-modulated carrier injection can affect the transition voltage
value at which a space-charge-limited bulk current-voltage (J-V) behavior is
changed from Ohmic (i.e., J ~ V) to nonlinear (i.e., J ~ V^n with n \geq 2).

paper, we propose a computationally efficient time-domain algorithm capable of
detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binaries of compact objects

algorithm also has the flexibility to trigger EM observation before the merger.
The key to the efficiency of our algorithm arises from the use of chains of
so-called Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, which filter time-series
data recursively. Computational cost is further reduced by a template
interpolation technique that requires filtering to be done only for a much
coarser template bank than otherwise required to sufficiently recover optimal
signal-to-noise ratio. Towards future detectors with sensitivity extending to
lower frequencies, our algorithm's computational cost is shown to increase
rather insignificantly compared to the conventional time-domain correlation

this method is expected to be computationally more efficient than the

weights are frequency-specific and derived under the quadratic risk criterion

well-known maximum as a function of water/AOT molar ratio, which is usually
attributed to increased attractions among nearly spherical droplets. The
maximum can be removed by adding salt or by changing the oil to CCl$_4$.
Systematic small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements have been used to
monitor the structure of the microemulsion droplets in the composition regime
where the maximum appears. On increasing the droplet concentration, the
scattering intensity is found to scale with the inverse of the wavevector, a
behavior which is consistent with cylindrical structures. The inverse
wavevector scaling is not observed when the molar ratio is changed, moving the
system away from the value corresponding to the viscosity maximum. It is also
not present in the scattering from systems containing enough added salt to
essentially eliminate the viscosity maximum. An asymptotic analysis of the SAXS
data, complemented by some quantitative modeling, is consistent with
cylindrical growth of droplets as their concentration is increased. Such
elongated structures are familiar from related AOT systems in which the sodium

the modulus presents a narrow dip at the MIT followed by an abrupt stiffening
of ~6%. The anomaly is reproducible between cooling and heating in
Nd0:65Eu0:35NiO3 but only appears as a slow stiffening during cooling in
undoped NdNiO3, conformingly with the fact that the MIT in RNiO3 changes from
strongly first order to second order when the mean R size is decreased. The
elastic anomaly seems not to be associated with the antiferromagnetic
transition, which is distinct from the MIT in Nd0.65Eu0.35NiO3. It is concluded
that the steplike stiffening is due to the disappearance or freezing of dynamic
Jahn- Teller (JT) distortions through the MIT, where the JT active Ni3+ is
disproportionated into alternating Ni3+d and Ni3-d. The fluctuating octahedral
JT distortion necessary to justify the observed jump in the elastic modulus is
estimated as ~3%, but does not have a role in determining the MIT, since the

telescopes without adaptive optics (AO) for wavefront correction in space

coronagraph, and to demonstrate its performance without adaptive wavefront
correction. Estimation of both the raw contrast and the gain of the point
spread function (PSF) subtraction were needed. The limiting factor of the
contrast was also important. A binary shaped pupil mask of a checkerboard type
has been designed. The mask, consisting of an aluminum film on a glass
substrate, was manufactured using nano-fabrication techniques with electron
beam lithography. Careful evaluation of coronagraphic performance, including
PSF subtraction, was carried out in air using the developed mask. A contrast of
$6.7 \times 10^{-8}$ was achieved for the raw coronagraphic image by areal
averaging of all of the observed dark regions. Following PSF subtraction, the
contrast reached $6.8 \times 10^{-9}$. Speckles were a major limiting factor
throughout the dark regions of both the raw image and the PSF subtracted image.
A rigid coronagraph with PSF subtraction without AO is a useful method to
achieve high contrast observations. Applications of a rigid coronagraph to a
Space Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) and other
platforms are discussed.

imply different error bounds. For uniformly ergodic and reversible Markov
chains we prove a lower and an upper error bound with respect to the L2 -norm
of f . If there exists an L2 -spectral gap, which is a weaker convergence
property than uniform ergodicity, then we show an upper error bound with

efficient way to tune the algorithm. We provide and justify a recipe how to
choose the burn-in period. The error bounds are applied to the problem of the

consider the integration with respect to log-concave densities and the
integration over convex bodies. By the use of the Metropolis algorithm based on

non-empty intersection. It is a well-known and simple fact that an intersecting
family of subsets of [n]={1,2,...,n} can contain at most 2^(n-1) sets. Katona,
Katona and Katona ask the following question. Suppose instead a family X of
subsets of [n] satisfies |X|=2^(n-1)+i for some fixed i>0. Create a new family
X_p by choosing each member of X independently with some fixed probability p.
How do we choose X to maximize the probability that X_p is intersecting? They
conjecture that there is a nested sequence of optimal families for i=1, 2, ...,
2^(n-1). In this paper, we show that the families [n]^(\ge
r)={A\subset[n]:|A|\ge r} are optimal for the appropriate values of i, thereby
proving the conjecture for this sequence of values. Moreover, we show that for
intermediate values of i there exist optimal families lying between those we
have found. It turns out that the optimal families we find simultaneously
maximize the number of intersecting subfamilies of every possible order.
Standard compression techniques appear inadequate to solve the problem as they
do not preserve intersection properties of subfamilies. Instead, our main tool
is a novel compression method, together with a way of `compressing'
subfamilies, which may be of independent interest.

shock models that have been invoked to explain the H_2 S(0), S(1), and S(2)
lines observed with Spitzer. We analyze our data together with the H_2 lines,
CO(3-2), and IR continuum from the literature using a combined PDR/shock model.
We find that the mid-J CO originates almost entirely from shock-excited warm
molecular gas; contributions from PDRs are negligible. Also, almost all the H_2
S(2) and half of the S(1) line is predicted to emerge from shocks. Shocks with
a pre-shock density of 2x10^4 cm^-3 and velocities of 10 km/s and 20 km/s for
C-shocks and J-shocks, respectively, provide the best fit. In contrast, the
[CI] line emission arises exclusively from the PDR component, which is best
parameterized by a density of 3.2x10^3 cm^-3 and a FUV field of G_o = 100 for
both PDR/shock-type combinations. Our mid-J CO observations show that
turbulence is a very important heating source in molecular clouds, even in
normal quiescent galaxies. The most likely energy sources for the shocks are
supernovae or outflows from YSOs. The energetics of these shock sources favor
C-shock excitation of the lines.

momentum transport. The excitation of nonaxisymmetric modes requires higher
rotation rates than the excitation of the axisymmetric mode and this the more
the higher the azimuthal mode number m. We find that the weak-field branch in
the instability map of the nonaxisymmetric modes has always a positive slope
(in opposition to the axisymmetric modes) so that for given magnetic field the
modes with m>0 always have an upper limit of the supercritical Reynolds number.
In order to excite a nonaxisymmetric mode at 1 AU in a Kepler disk a minimum
field strength of about 1 Gauss is necessary. For weaker magnetic field the
nonaxisymmetric modes decay. The angular momentum transport of the
nonaxisymmetric modes is always positive and depends linearly on the Lundquist
number of the background field. The molecular viscosity and the basic rotation
rate do not influence the related {\alpha}-parameter. We did not find any
indication that the MRI decays for small magnetic Prandtl number as found by
use of shearing-box codes. At 1 AU in a Kepler disk and a field strength of

magnetosdisc field structure on the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current
system at Jupiter. We find that the azimuthal current intensity, and thus the
stretching of the magnetic field lines, is dependent on the
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, i.e. the
ionospheric Pedersen conductivity and iogenic plasma mass outflow rate.
Overall, however, the equatorial magnetic field profiles obtained are similar
in the inner region to those used previously, such that the currents are of the
same order as previous solutions obtained using a fixed empirical equatorial
field strength model, although the outer fringing field of the current disc
acts to reverse the field-aligned current in the outer region. We also find
that, while the azimuthal current in the inner region is dominated by hot
plasma pressure, as is generally held to be the case at Jupiter, the use of a
realistic plasma angular velocity profile actually results in the centrifugal
current becoming dominant in the outer magnetosphere. In addition, despite the
dependence of the intensity of the azimuthal current on the
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system parameters, the location of
the peak field-aligned current in the equatorial plane also varies, such that
the ionospheric location remains roughly constant. It is thus found that
significant changes to the mass density of the iogenic plasma disc are required
to explain the variation in the main oval location observed using the Hubble
Space Telescope.

(diagonalizing the York-Lichnerowicz approach) in ADM tetrad gravity for
asymptotically Minkowskian space-times without super-translations. This allows
to identify the inertial (gauge) and tidal (physical) degrees of freedom of the
gravitational field and to interpret Ashtekar variables in these space-times.
The use of radar 4-coordinates centered on a time-like observer allows to
connect the 3+1 splittings of space-time with the relativistic metrology used
in atomic physics and astronomy. The asymptotic ADM Poincar\'e group replaces
the Poincar\'e group of particle physics. The general relativistic remnant of
the gauge freedom in clock synchronization is described by the inertial gauge
variable ${}^3K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the non-Euclidean
3-spaces. The theory can be linearized in a Post-Minkowskian way by using the
asymptotic Minkowski metric as an asymptotic background at spatial infinity and
the family of non-harmonic 3-orthogonal Schwinger time gauges allows to
reproduce the known results on gravitational waves in harmonic gauges. It is
shown that the main signatures for the existence of dark matter can be
reinterpreted as an relativistic inertial effect induced by ${}^3K$: while in
the space-time inertial and gravitational masses coincide (equivalence
principle), this is not true in the non-Euclidean 3-spaces (breaking of Newton
equivalence principle), where the inertial mass has extra ${}^3K$-dependent
terms simulating dark matter. Therefore a Post-Minkowskian extension of the

atom, i.e. a semiconductor quantum dot. The photon correlation measurements
demonstrate both 'single' and 'heralded' photon emission from the Mollow
triplet sidebands. The ultra-bright and narrowband emission (5.9 MHz into the
first lens) can be conveniently frequency-tuned by laser detuning over 15 times
its linewidth ({\Delta \nu} \approx 1.0 GHz). These unique properties make the
Mollow triplet sideband emission a valuable light source for, e.g.quantum light
spectroscopy and quantum information applications.

Borrowing the ideas from input-to-state stability (ISS) and integral
input-to-state stability (iISS), robust consensus and integral robust consensus
are defined with respect to $L_\infty$ and $L_1$ norms of the disturbance
functions, respectively. Sufficient and/or necessary connectivity conditions
are obtained for the system to reach robust consensus or integral robust
consensus, which answer the question: how much communication capacity is
required for a multi-agent network to converge despite certain amount of
disturbance. The $\epsilon$-convergence time is then obtained for the network
as a special case of the robustness analysis. The results are based on quite
general assumptions on switching graph, weights rule and noise regularity. In
addition, as an illustration of the applicability of the results, distributed
event-triggered coordination is studied.

galaxies selected by their 70 um emission in the Extended-Chandra Deep

in these infrared sources through their X-ray emission and quantify the
fraction that host an AGN. We find that the fraction depends strongly on both
the mid-infrared color and rest-frame mid-infrared luminosity of the source,
rising to ~ 50-70% at the warmest colors and highest mid-infrared luminosities
(corresponding to ultraluminous infrared galaxies), similar to the trends found
locally. Additionally, we find that the AGN fraction depends strongly on the
star formation rate of the host galaxy (inferred from the observed 70 um
luminosity after subtracting the estimated AGN contribution), particularly for
more luminous AGNs (L_X > 10^43 erg/s). At the highest star formation rates (~
1000 M_sun/yr), the fraction of galaxies with an X-ray detected AGN rises to ~
30%, roughly consistent with that found in high-redshift submillimeter
galaxies. Assuming that the AGN fraction is driven by the star formation rate
(rather than stellar mass or redshift, for which our sample is largely
degenerate), this result implies that the duty cycle of luminous AGN activity
increases with the star formation rate of the host galaxy: specifically, we
find that luminous X-ray detected AGNs are at least ~ 5-10 times more common in
systems with high star formation rates (> 300 M_sun/yr) than in systems with
lower star formation rates (< 30 M_sun/yr). Lastly, we investigate the ratio
between the supermassive black hole accretion rate and the growth rate of the
host galaxy and find that, for sources with detected AGNs and star formation,
this ratio in distant starbursts agrees well with that expected from the local
scaling relation assuming the black holes and bulges grew at the same epoch.

hierarchical model. Fitting this model requires assessing the Level-2 variance
$A\equiv\operatorname {Var}(\theta_i)$ to estimate shrinkages $B_i\equiv
V_i/(V_i+A)$ toward a (possibly estimated) subspace, with $B_i$ as the target
because the conditional means and variances of $\theta_i$ depend linearly on
$B_i$, not on $A$. Adjustment for density maximization, ADM, can do the fitting
for any smooth prior on $A$. Like the MLE, ADM bases inferences on two
derivatives, but ADM can approximate with any Pearson family, with Beta
distributions being appropriate because shrinkage factors satisfy $0\le
B_i\le1$. Our emphasis is on frequency properties, which leads to adopting a
uniform prior on $A\ge0$, which then puts Stein's harmonic prior (SHP) on the
$k$ random effects. It is known for the ""equal variances case"" $V_1=...=V_k$
that formal Bayes procedures for this prior produce admissible minimax
estimates of the random effects, and that the posterior variances are large
enough to provide confidence intervals that meet their nominal coverages.
Similar results are seen to hold for our approximating ""ADM-SHP"" procedure for
equal variances and also for the unequal variances situations checked here. For
shrinkage coefficient estimation, the ADM-SHP procedure allows an alternative
frequency interpretation. Writing $L(A)$ as the likelihood of $B_i$ with $i$
fixed, ADM-SHP estimates $B_i$ as $\hat{B_i}=V_i/(V_i+\hat{A})$ with
$\hat{A}\equiv \operatorname {argmax}(A*L(A))$. This justifies the term

use of ABS and SDS for modelling agents' behaviour in an environment with

types of agents it is preferable to use SDS, as it takes up less computational
resources and produces the same results as those obtained by the ABS model. In
order to move this research forward, our next research question is: if we
introduce interactions between these agents will SDS still be the most
appropriate paradigm to be used? To answer this question for immune system
simulation problems, we will use, as case studies, models involving
interactions between tumour cells and immune effector cells. Experiments show
that there are cases where SDS and ABS can not be used interchangeably, and
therefore, their comparison is not straightforward.

The tangent cones of $Y$ at a point $p\in Y$ are known to be metric cones
$C(X)$, however they need not be unique. Let
$\bar\Omega_{Y,p}\subseteq\cM_{GH}$ be the closed subset of compact metric
spaces $X$ which arise as cross sections for the tangents cones of $Y$ at $p$.
In this paper we study the properties of $\bar\Omega_{Y,p}$. In particular, we
give necessary and sufficient conditions for an open smooth family
$\Omega\equiv (X_s,g_s)$ of closed manifolds to satisfy $\bar\Omega
=\bar\Omega_{Y,p}$ for {\it some} limit $Y$ and point $p\in Y$ as above, where
$\bar\Omega$ is the closure of $\Omega$ in the set of metric spaces equipped
with the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We use this characterization to construct
examples which exhibit fundamentally new behaviors. The first application is to
construct limit spaces $(Y^n,d_Y,p)$ with $n\geq 3$ such that at $p$ there
exists for every $0\leq k\leq n-2$ a tangent cone at $p$ of the form
$\RR^{k}\times C(X^{n-k-1})$, where $X^{n-k-1}$ is a smooth manifold not
isometric to the standard sphere. In particular, this is the first example
which shows that a stratification of a limit space $Y$ based on the Euclidean
behavior of tangent cones is not possible or even well defined. It is also the
first example of a three dimensional limit space with nonunique tangent cones.
The second application is to construct a limit space $(Y^5,d_Y,p)$, such that
at $p$ the tangent cones are not only not unique, but not homeomorphic.
Specifically, some tangent cones are homeomorphic to cones over $\CC
P^2\sharp\bar{\CC P}^2$ while others are homeomorphic to cones over $\Sn^4$.

constructing universal coverings works well only for the class of Poincar\' e
spaces. For general spaces there were several attempts to define generalized
coverings (see \cite{BP3}, \cite{BDLM}, and \cite{FisZas}), yet there is no
general theory so far that covers all path connected spaces. In this paper we
plan to remedy that by changing the order of things: we define the universal
covering first and its group of deck transformations is the new fundamental
group of the base space.
  The basic idea is that a non-trivial loop ought to be detected by a covering
(not by extension over the unit disk): a loop is non-trivial if there is a
covering such that some lift of the loop is a non-loop.
  So it remains to define coverings: the most natural class is the class of
maps that have unique disk lifting property. To make the theory work one needs
to add the assumption that path components of pre-images of open sets form a
basis of the total space.

this motivation, we studied several decision/optimization versions of this

Clasp, and then identify similar/diverse solutions using clustering methods.
The online methods compute similar/diverse solutions following one of the three
approaches: by reformulating the ASP representation of the problem to compute
similar/diverse solutions at once using an ASP solver; by computing
similar/diverse solutions iteratively (one after other) using an ASP solver; by
modifying the search algorithm of an ASP solver to compute similar/diverse
solutions incrementally. We modified Clasp to implement the last online method
and called it Clasp-NK. In the first two online methods, the given distance
function is represented in ASP; in the last one it is implemented in C++. We
showed the applicability and the effectiveness of these methods on
reconstruction of similar/diverse phylogenies for Indo-European languages, and
on several planning problems in Blocks World. We observed that in terms of
computational efficiency the last online method outperforms the others; also it

evolving with time. Thus, our model is nonparametric and generalizes the
traditional parametric state-space models. This random function approach also
frees us from the restrictive assumption that the functional forms, although
time-dependent, are of fixed forms. The traditional approach of assuming known,
parametric functional forms is questionable, particularly in state-space
models, since the validation of the assumptions require data on both the
observed time series and the latent states; however, data on the latter are not
available in state-space models.
  We specify Gaussian processes as priors of the random functions and exploit
the ""look-up table approach"" of \ctn{Bhattacharya07} to efficiently handle the
dynamic structure of the model. We consider both univariate and multivariate
situations, using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for studying the
posterior distributions of interest. In the case of challenging multivariate
situations we demonstrate that the newly developed Transformation-based MCMC
(TMCMC) of \ctn{Dutta11} provides interesting and efficient alternatives to the
usual proposal distributions. We illustrate our methods with a challenging
multivariate simulated data set, where the true observational and the
evolutionary equations are highly non-linear, and treated as unknown. The
results we obtain are quite encouraging. Moreover, using our Gaussian process
approach we analysed a real data set, which has also been analysed by

low-level languages, i.e., stack-based imperative languages that lack strong
type systems and automatic memory management.
  In this paper, we describe techniques for self-adjusting computation which
are suitable for low-level languages. Necessarily, we take a different approach
than previous work: instead of starting with a high-level language with
additional primitives to support self-adjusting computation, we start with a
low-level intermediate language, whose semantics is given by a stack-based
abstract machine. We prove that this semantics is sound: it always updates
computations in a way that is consistent with full reevaluation. We give a
compiler and runtime system for the intermediate language used by our abstract
machine. We present an empirical evaluation that shows that our approach is
efficient in practice, and performs favorably compared to prior proposals.

achieve a fully quantitative fit. Our analysis, however, is regulated by the

phase slips, degeneracy of stable solutions and double bifurcation composition.
As a result of our analysis, we show that stable fixed points in the
synchronized region may be obtained with just a small amount of the existent
solutions, and for a class of natural frequencies configuration we show
analytical expressions for the critical synchronization coupling as a function
of the number of oscillators, both exact and asymptotic.

submillisecond pulsars. The blind search was conducted within 3deg of the
Galactic plane and at longitudes between 20 and 110deg. It takes 22073
pointings to cover this region, and 5487 different positions in the sky. The
first targeted search was aimed at Galactic globular clusters, the second one
at 24 bright polarized and pointlike radiosources with steep spectra, and the
third at 65 faint polarized and pointlike radiosources. The observations were
conducted at the large radiotelescope of Nancay Observatory, at a frequency
near 1400 MHz. Two successive backends were used, first a VLBI S2 system,
second a digital acquisition board and a PC with large storage capacity
sampling the signal at 50 Mb/s on one bit, over a 24-MHz band and in one
polarization. The bandwidth of acquisition of the second backend was later
increased to 48 MHz and the sampling rate to 100 Mb/s. The survey used the
three successive setups, with respective sensitivities of 3.5, 2.2, and 1.7
mJy. The targeted-search data were obtained with the third setup and reduced
with a method based on the Hough transform, yielding a sensitivity of 0.9 mJy.
The processing of the data was done in slightly differed time by
soft-correlation in all cases. No new short-period millisecond pulsars were
discovered in the different searches. To better understand the null result of
the blind survey, we estimate the probability of detecting one or more
short-period pulsars among a given Galactic population of synthetic pulsars
with our setup: 25% for the actual incomplete survey and 79% if we had
completed the whole survey with a uniform nominal sensitivity of 1.7 mJy. The
alternative of surveying a smaller, presumably more densely populated, region
with a higher sensitivity would have a low return and would be impractical at a
transit instrument. (abridged)

The ants are
modeled as self-propelled particles which deposit directed pheromones and
interact with them through alignment interaction. The directed pheromones
intend to model pieces of trails, while the alignment interaction translates
the tendency for an ant to follow a trail when it meets it. Thanks to adequate
quantitative descriptors of the trail patterns, the existence of a phase
transition as the ant-pheromone interaction frequency is increased can be
evidenced. Finally, we propose both kinetic and fluid descriptions of this
model and analyze the capabilities of the fluid model to develop trail
patterns. We observe that the development of patterns by fluid models require
extra trail amplification mechanisms that are not needed at the
Individual-Based Model level.

Infrared Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. More than 11,000
distinct sources were extracted using a dedicated algorithm based on the SMART
software with an optimal extraction (AdOpt package). These correspond to all
13,000 low resolution observations of fixed objects (both single source and
cluster observations). The pipeline includes image cleaning, individual
exposure combination, and background subtraction. A particular attention is
given to bad pixel and outlier rejection at the image and spectra levels. Most
sources are spatially unresolved so that optimal extraction reaches the highest
possible signal-to-noise ratio. For all sources, an alternative extraction is
also provided that accounts for all of the source flux within the aperture.
CASSIS provides publishable quality spectra through an online database together
with several important diagnostics, such as the source spatial extent and a
quantitative measure of detection level. Ancillary data such as available
spectroscopic redshifts are also provided. The database interface will
eventually provide various ways to interact with the spectra, such as
on-the-fly measurements of spectral features or comparisons among spectra.

produced. Some of the structures are formed by spherical and ellipsoidal
nanoclusters. Membrane geometry and pulsed current electroplating parameters
are the main factors, which determine the shape formation process of these

geometry, electrolyte composition and pulsed current electroplating parameters
one can deliberately fabricate volume ordered complex shape nano- and submicron
structures of various metals and alloys. Such objects can be of interest for
fundamental research as well as for applications in catalysis, electronics,
optics, medicine, etc.
