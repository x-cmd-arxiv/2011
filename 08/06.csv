approaches on various types of static problems of continuum mechanics.
Particularly, form-finding problems of tension structures are discussed in the
first half and the large deformation problems of continuum bodies are discussed
in the last half. In the first half, as the standards of iterative direct
minimization strategies, two types of simple recursive methods are presented,
namely the two-term method and the three-term method. The dual estimate is also
introduced as a powerful means of involving equally constraint conditions into
minimization problems. As examples of direct minimization approaches on usual
engineering issues, some form finding problems of tension structures which can
be solved by the presented strategies are illustrated. Additionally, it is
pointed out that while the two-term method sometimes becomes useless, the
three-term method always provides remarkable rate of global convergence
efficiency. Then, to show the potential ability of the three-term method, in
the last part of this work, some principle of virtual works which usually
appear in the continuum mechanics are approximated and discretized in a common
manner, which are suitable to be solved by the three-term method. Finally, some
large deformation analyses of continuum bodies which can be solved by the
three-term method are presented.

exponentiation in multiparton scattering amplitudes, where the exponent is
written as a sum of webs - closed sets of diagrams whose colour and kinematic
parts are entangled via mixing matrices. A complementary approach to
exponentiation is based on the multiplicative renormalizability of intersecting
Wilson lines, and their subsequent finite anomalous dimension. Relating this
framework to that of webs, we derive renormalization constraints expressing all
multiple poles of any given web in terms of lower-order webs. We examine these
constraints explicitly up to four loops, and find that they are realised
through the action of the web mixing matrices in conjunction with the fact that
multiple pole terms in each diagram reduce to sums of products of lower-loop
integrals. Relevant singularities of multi-eikonal amplitudes up to three loops
are calculated in dimensional regularization using an exponential infrared
regulator. Finally, we formulate a new conjecture for web mixing matrices,
involving a weighted sum over column entries. Our results form an important
step in understanding non-Abelian exponentiation in multiparton amplitudes, and
pave the way for higher-loop computations of the soft anomalous dimension.

difficult to reliably connect, for example by all-atom molecular dynamics
calculations, the states, their energies and the pathways between them. A major
issue needed to improve sampling on the intermediate states is an order

that can be used to aid sampling for the large conformational change. We
present a novel way to combine information from molecular dynamics using

determine an order parameter connecting two large-scale conformationally

considered as a mere first step towards more sophisticated models. Spherical
symmetry is but a mathematical simplification and one must consider spherical
symmetric models as exhibiting an energy density smoothed out over angles
around us. However, they have been taken at face value by some authors who
tried to use them for either irrelevant purposes or to put them to the test as
if they were robust models of our Universe. We wish to clarify how these models

(parabolic) LT models always exhibit an overdensity near their centre and
growing-mode (elliptic or hyperbolic) LT models, a void. This is at variance
with some statements in the literature. We dismiss all previous proposals
merely designed to test the spherical symmetry of the LT models, and we agree
that the value of $H_0$ and the measurement of the redshift drift are valid
tests of the models. However, we suspect that this last test, which is the best
in principle, will be more complicated to implement than usually claimed.

benchmark for calibration of theoretical evolutionary models of low-mass stars.
The limiting factor to the precision of this calibration is the age of the
system, as both the mass and luminosity of ABDorA and C are well monitored by
other ongoing programs. In this paper we present VLTI/AMBER observations of
ABDorA which provide a direct measurement of the size of this star, 0.96+/-0.06

distinct from others in the compressed sensing literature. While sparsity has
been applied in the context of tomography, key questions regarding uniqueness
and recovery remain unanswered. Our work exploits the tree structure of path
measurements to derive sufficient conditions for sparse solutions to be unique
and the condition that $\ell_1$ minimization recovers the true underlying
solution. We present a fast single-pass linear algorithm for $\ell_1$
minimization and prove that a minimum $\ell_1$ solution is both unique and
sparsest for tree topologies. By considering the placement of lossy links
within trees, we show that sparse solutions remain unique more often than is
commonly supposed. We prove similar results for a noisy version of the problem.

Internet traffic. P2P systems have emerged as an accepted way to share enormous
volumes of data. Needs for widely distributed information systems supporting
virtual organizations have given rise to a new category of P2P systems called
schema-based. In such systems each peer is a database management system in
itself, ex-posing its own schema. In such a setting, the main objective is the
efficient search across peer databases by processing each incoming query
without overly consuming bandwidth. The usability of these systems depends on
successful techniques to find and retrieve data; however, efficient and
effective routing of content-based queries is an emerging problem in P2P
networks. This work was attended as an attempt to motivate the use of mining
algorithms in the P2P context may improve the significantly the efficiency of
such methods. Our proposed method based respectively on combination of
clustering with hypergraphs. We use ECCLAT to build approximate clustering and
discovering meaningful clusters with slight overlapping. We use an algorithm
MTMINER to extract all minimal transversals of a hypergraph (clusters) for
query routing. The set of clusters improves the robustness in queries routing
mechanism and scalability in P2P Network. We compare the performance of our
method with the baseline one considering the queries routing problem. Our
experimental results prove that our proposed methods generate impressive levels
of performance and scalability with with respect to important criteria such as
response time, precision and recall.

isospin violation. The dark matter is nearly Dirac, but with small Majorana
masses induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking, so that the gauge boson
couplings become exactly off-diagonal in the mass basis, and the small mass
splitting needed for inelasticity is simultaneously produced. If only elastic
scattering is demanded, then an alternative model, with interference between
the kinetically mixed gauge boson and a hidden sector scalar Higgs, is adequate
to give the required isospin violation. In both cases, the light kinetically
mixed gauge boson is in the range of interest for currently running fixed

studied redshifts the average luminosity functions of the LRGs and their
satellite galaxies are poorly fitted by a Schechter function due to a
luminosity gap between the centrals and their most luminous satellites. We
utilize a two-component fit of a Schechter function plus a log-normal
distribution to demonstrate that LRGs are typically brighter than their most
luminous satellite by roughly 1.3 magnitudes. This luminosity gap implies that
interactions within LRG environments are typically restricted to minor mergers
with mass ratios of 1:4 or lower. The luminosity functions further imply that
roughly 35% of the mass in the environment is locked in the LRG itself,
supporting the idea that mass growth through major mergers within the

least partially explained by the selection of LRGs as the gap can be reproduced

work we refine this no-go result by demonstrating that there are no infinite
sequences accumulating to the large complex structure point of a certain class
of one-parameter Calabi-Yau manifolds. We perform a similar analysis for
conifold points and for the decoupling limit, obtaining identical results.
Furthermore, we establish the absence of infinite sequences in a D-limit
corresponding to the large complex structure limit of a two-parameter
Calabi-Yau. In particular, our results demonstrate analytically that the series
of vacua recently discovered by Ahlqvist et al., seemingly accumulating to the
large complex structure point, are finite. We perform a numerical study of
these series close to the large complex structure point using appropriate
approximations for the period functions. This analysis reveals that the series
bounce out from the large complex structure point, and that the flux eventually
ceases to be imaginary self-dual. Finally, we study D-limits for F-theory
compactifications on K3\times K3 for which the finiteness of supersymmetric
vacua is already established. We do find infinite sequences of flux vacua which

against both local Jeans instabilities and discontinuous edge instabilities. We
examine these timescales for collapse in spheres, discs, and cylinders, with
emphasis on the structure, size, and degree of internal perturbations required
in order for local collapse to occur before global collapse. We find that
internal, local collapse is more effective for the lower dimensional objects.
Spheres and discs, if unsupported against global collapse, must either contain
strong perturbations or must be unrealistically large in order for small
density perturbations to collapse significantly faster than the entire cloud.
We find, on the other hand, that filamentary geometry is the most favorable
situation for the smallest perturbations to grow before global collapse
overwhelms them and that filaments containing only a few Jeans masses and weak
density perturbations can readily fragment. These idealized solutions are
compared with simulations of star-forming regions in an attempt to delineate
the role of global, local, and edge instabilities in determining the
fragmentation properties of molecular clouds. The combined results are also

solar zodiacal dust cloud. In an edge-on system, the dust ""clumps"" periodically
pass in front of the star as the planet orbits, occulting and
forward-scattering starlight. In this paper, we predict the shape and magnitude
of the corresponding transit signal. To do so, we model the dust distributions
of collisional, steady-state exozodiacal clouds perturbed by planetary
companions. We examine disks with dusty ring structures formed by the planet's
resonant trapping of in-spiraling dust for a range of planet masses and
semi-major axes, dust properties, and disk masses. We synthesize edge-on images
of these models and calculate the transit signatures of the resonant ring
structures. The transit light curves created by dusty resonant ring structures
typically exhibit two broad transit minima that lead and trail the planetary
transit. We find that Jupiter-mass planets embedded within disks hundreds of
times denser than our zodiacal cloud can create resonant ring structures with
transit depths up to $\sim10^{-4}$, possibly detectable with \emph{Kepler}.
Resonant rings produced by planets more or less massive than Jupiter produce
smaller transit depths. Observations of these transit signals may provide upper

graviton degrees of freedom. According to a theorem of Hojman, Kuchar, and
Teitelboim, modifications of general relativity must either introduce new
degrees of freedom or violate the principle of general covariance. In this
paper, we explore modifications of general relativity that retain the same
number of gravitational degrees of freedom, and therefore explicitly break
general covariance. Motivated by cosmology, the modifications of interest
maintain spatial covariance. Demanding consistency of the theory forces the
physical Hamiltonian density to obey an analogue of the renormalization group
equation. In this context, the equation encodes the invariance of the theory
under flow through the space of conformally equivalent spatial metrics. This
paper is dedicated to setting up the formalism of our approach and applying it
to a realistic class of theories. Forthcoming work will apply the formalism
more generally.

mergers create shock waves within the intracluster medium (ICM) that can
accelerate particles to extreme energies. In the presence of magnetic fields,
relativistic electrons form large regions emitting synchrotron radiation,
so-called radio relics. Behind the shock front, synchrotron and inverse Compton
(IC) losses cause the radio spectral index to steepen away from the shock
front. An example of such a cluster is CIZA J2242.8+5301, where very clear
spectral steepening in the downstream region is observed. Here we present
hydrodynamical simulations of idealized binary cluster mergers with the aim of
constraining the merger scenario for this cluster. From our simulations, we
find that CIZA J2242.8+5301 is probably undergoing a merger in the plane of the
sky (less then 10 deg from edge-on) with a mass ratio of about 2:1, and an
impact parameter < 400 kpc. We find that the core passage of the clusters
happened about 1 Gyr ago. We conclude that double relics relics can set
constraints on the mass ratios, impact parameters, timescales, and viewing
geometry of binary cluster mergers, which is particularly useful when detailed
X-ray observations are not available. In addition, the presence of large radio
relics can be used to constrain the degree of clumping in the outskirts of the
ICM, which is important to constrain the baryon fraction, density and entropy
profiles, around the virial radius and beyond. We find that the amplitude of
density fluctuations, with sizes of < 200 kpc, in the relic in CIZA
J2242.8+5301 is not larger than 30%. [abridged]

graphs are considered: directed trees and undirected graphs. We prove stability
of the formation with arbitrary number of vehicles for linear as well as a
class of nonlinear controllers. In the case of linear control, we provide
quantitative scaling laws of the stability margin and sensitivity to external
disturbances (H-infinity norm) with respect to the number of vehicles $N$ in
the formation. It is shown that the formation with directed tree graph achieves
size-independent stability margin but suffers from high algebraic growth of
initial errors. The stability margin in case of the undirected graph decays to
0 as at least $O(1/N)$. In addition, we show that the sensitivity to external
disturbances in directed tree graphs is geometric in $k$ where $k <= N$ is the
number of generations of the directed tree, while that of the undirected graph
is only quadratic in $N$. In particular, for 1-D vehicular platoons, we obtain
precise formulae for the H-infinity norm of the transfer function from the
disturbances to the position errors. It is shown that the H-infinity norm
scales as $O(\alpha^N) (\alpha>1)$ for predecessor-following architecture, but
only as $O(N^3)$ for symmetric bidirectional architectures. For a class of
nonlinear controllers, numerical simulations show that the transient response
due to initial errors and sensitivity to external disturbances are improved

noise and information flow from neighbors: larger, slowly decaying \alpha_k
improves information flow but injects more communication noise. Further, we
quantify the best achievable C_{\mathrm{dis}} as a function of the sensing

of the decays indicates fully gapped hole bands and nodal or very anisotropic

present spherically-symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the long-term
accretion of a rotating gamma-ray burst progenitor star, a ""collapsar,"" onto
the central compact object, which we take to be a black hole. The simulations
were carried out with the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH in one spatial
dimension and with rotation, an explicit shear viscosity, and convection in the
mixing length theory approximation. Once the accretion flow becomes
rotationally supported outside of the black hole, an accretion shock forms and
traverses the stellar envelope. Energy is carried from the central
geometrically thick accretion disk to the stellar envelope by convection.
Energy losses through neutrino emission and nuclear photodisintegration are
calculated but do not seem important following the rapid early drop of the
accretion rate following circularization. We find that the shock velocity,
energy, and unbound mass are sensitive to convective efficiency, effective
viscosity, and initial stellar angular momentum. Our simulations show that
given the appropriate combinations of stellar and physical parameters,
explosions with energies ~5x10^50 ergs, velocities 3000 km/s, and unbound

The Second LAT AGN Catalog (2LAC) includes 1017 gamma-ray sources located at
high Galactic latitudes (|b|>10{\deg}) that are detected with a test statistic
greater than 25 and associated statistically with AGNs. However some of these
are affected by analysis issues and some are associated with multiple AGNs.
Consequently we define a clean sample which includes 886 AGNs, comprising 395
BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), 310 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 157
candidate blazars of unknown type (i.e., with broad-band blazar characteristics
but with no optical spectral measurement yet), eight misaligned AGNs, four
narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1s), 10 AGNs of other types and two starburst
galaxies. Where possible, the blazars have been further classified based on
their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as archival radio, optical, and
X-ray data permit. While almost all FSRQs have a synchrotron-peak frequency
10^14 Hz, about half of the BL Lacs have a synchrotron-peak frequency >10^15
Hz. The 2LAC represents a significant improvement relative to the First LAT AGN
Catalog (1LAC), with 52% more associated sources. The full characterization of
the newly detected sources will require more broad-band data. Various
properties, such as gamma-ray fluxes and photon power law spectral indices,
redshifts, gamma-ray luminosities, variability, and archival radio
luminosities---and their correlations are presented and discussed for the
different blazar classes. The general trends observed in 1LAC are confirmed.

particular, in the case with delayed CSI on both channels, it is shown that the
optimal SDoF is 2/3. We then generalize the result to the two-user Gaussian
MISO broadcast channel with confidential messages and characterize the SDoF
region when the transmitter has delayed CSI of both receivers. Interestingly,
the artificial noise schemes exploiting several time instances are shown to
provide the optimal SDoF region by masking the confidential message to the

  Wireless","10pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performances of the routing protocols are important since they compute
the primary path between source and destination. In addition, routing protocols
need to detect failure within a short period of time when nodes move to start
updating the routing table in order to find a new primary path to the
destination. Meantime, loss of packets and end-to- end delays will increase
thereby reducing throughput and degrading the performance of the network. This
paper proposes a new algorithm, DBRT (Driven Backup Routing Table), to improve
the existing proactive protocols such as DSDV (Destination Sequenced Distance
Vector) protocol by creating a backup routing table to provide multiple
alternative routes. The DBRT algorithm identifies adjacent nodes for each node
in the same range and then selects one of these as a backup next hop according
to the available path to the destination. The results show that loss of data
packets, throughput and end-to-end delay times between source and destination
are improved. The results show that the new protocol does not degrade the
network's performance despite sending extra messages to construct and update
the new backup routing table. Simulations (using an NS2 simulator) are
undertaken to demonstrate the difference between using a DSDV protocol with or
without the proposed schema.

protocols when failure occurred is required. These applications can be very
sensitive to packet loss when link/node goes down. In this paper, we propose
two algorithms schemas for the link state protocol to reroute the traffic in
two states; first, pre-calculated an alternative and disjoint path with the
primary one from the source to the destination by re-routing traffic through
it, regardless of the locations of failure and the number of failed links.
Second, rerouting the traffic via an alternative path from a node whose local
link is down without the need to wait until the source node knows about the
failure. This is achieved by creating a new backup routing table based on the
original routing table which is computed by the dijkstra algorithm. The goal of
these algorithms is to reduce loss of packets, end-to-end delay time, improve
throughput and avoiding local loop when nodes re-converge the topology in case
of failure.

given a collection of graphs and associated classes, how can one predict the
class of a newly observed graph? To address this question we propose a
statistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of
estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or ""signal-subgraph,""
defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between
the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal
and efficient, but differ by their assumption about the ""coherency"" of the
signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges ""stick
together"" around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best
estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but
also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a
contemporary neuroscience question: can we classify ""connectomes""
(brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better
than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates
that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of
training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of
salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions.

studying the kinetic behavior of biomolecules. Through application of an
external force, conformational states with small or transient populations can
be stabilized, allowing them to be characterized and the statistics of
individual trajectories studied to provide insight into biomolecular folding
and function. Because the observed quantity (force or extension) is not
necessarily an ideal reaction coordinate, individual observations cannot be
uniquely associated with kinetically distinct conformations. While
maximum-likelihood schemes such as hidden Markov models have solved this
problem for other classes of single-molecule experiments by using temporal
information to aid in the inference of a sequence of distinct conformational
states, these methods do not give a clear picture of how precisely the model
parameters are determined by the data due to instrument noise and finite-sample
statistics, both significant problems in force spectroscopy. We solve this
problem through a Bayesian extension that allows the experimental uncertainties
to be directly quantified, and build in detailed balance to further reduce
uncertainty through physical constraints. We illustrate the utility of this
approach in characterizing the three-state kinetic behavior of an RNA hairpin

Higgs is free to propagate in the bulk. It is demonstrated that, like the RS
model, one can generate the hierarchy of fermion masses by localising the
fermions at different locations throughout the space. However, there are two
significant differences. Firstly the possible fermion masses scale down, from
the electroweak scale, less steeply than in the RS model and secondly there now
exists a minimum fermion mass for fermions sitting towards the UV brane. With a
quadratic Higgs VEV, this minimum mass is about fifteen orders of magnitude
lower than the electroweak scale. We derive the gauge propagator and despite
the KK masses scaling as $m_n^2\sim n$, it is demonstrated that the
coefficients of four fermion operators are not divergent at tree level. FCNC's
amongst kaons and leptons are considered and compared to calculations in the RS
model, with a brane localised Higgs and equivalent levels of tuning. It is
found that since the gauge fermion couplings are slightly more universal and
the SM fermions typically sit slightly further towards the UV brane, the
contributions to observables such as $\epsilon_K$ and $\Delta m_K$, from the
exchange of KK gauge fields, are significantly reduced.

Source detection is based on the average flux over the 24-month period. The
Second Fermi-LAT catalog (2FGL) includes source location regions, defined in
terms of elliptical fits to the 95% confidence regions and spectral fits in
terms of power-law, exponentially cutoff power-law, or log-normal forms. Also
included are flux measurements in 5 energy bands and light curves on monthly
intervals for each source. Twelve sources in the catalog are modeled as
spatially extended. We provide a detailed comparison of the results from this
catalog with those from the first Fermi-LAT catalog (1FGL). Although the
diffuse Galactic and isotropic models used in the 2FGL analysis are improved
compared to the 1FGL catalog, we attach caution flags to 162 of the sources to
indicate possible confusion with residual imperfections in the diffuse model.
The 2FGL catalog contains 1873 sources detected and characterized in the 100
MeV to 100 GeV range of which we consider 127 as being firmly identified and
1170 as being reliably associated with counterparts of known or likely
gamma-ray-producing source classes.

is the phenomenon of deuterium-burning pulsation in brown dwarfs and
very-low-mass stars, whose existence on 1-4 hours timescales has been proposed
but not yet borne out by observations. To investigate short-timescale
variability in young, low-mass objects, we carried out high-precision,
high-cadence time series monitoring with the Warm Spitzer mission on 14 low
mass stars and brown dwarfs in the ~3 Myr Sigma Orionis cluster. The flux in
many of our raw light curves is strongly correlated with sub-pixel position and
can vary systematically as much as 10%. We present a new approach to
disentangle true stellar variability from this ""pixel-phase effect,"" which is
more pronounced in Warm Spitzer observations as compared to the cryogenic
mission. The light curves after correction reveal that most of the sample is
devoid of variability down to the few-millimagnitude level, on the minute to
day timescales probed. However, one exceptional brown dwarf displays erratic
brightness changes at the 10-15% level, suggestive of variable obscuration by
dusty material. The uninterrupted 24-hour datastream and sub-1% photometric
precision enables limits on pulsation in the near-infrared. If this phenomenon
is present in our light curves, then its amplitude must lie below 2-3
millimagnitudes. In addition, we present three field eclipsing binaries and one

mechanism for cooperation in social dilemma situations with which players help
others when they are helped by somebody else. It is a type of indirect
reciprocity. Although upstream reciprocity is often observed in experiments,
most theories suggest that it is operative only when players form short cycles
such as triangles, implying a small population size, or when it is combined
with other mechanisms that promote cooperation on their own. An expectation is
that real social networks, which are known to be full of triangles and other
short cycles, may accommodate upstream reciprocity. In this study, I extend the
upstream reciprocity game proposed for a directed cycle by Boyd and Richerson
to the case of general networks. The model is not evolutionary and concerns the
conditions under which the unanimity of cooperative players is a Nash
equilibrium. I show that an abundance of triangles or other short cycles in a
network does little to promote upstream reciprocity. Cooperation is less likely
for a larger population size even if triangles are abundant in the network. In
addition, in contrast to the results for evolutionary social dilemma games on
networks, scale-free networks lead to less cooperation than networks with a
homogeneous degree distribution.

conventional assumption that the prompt emission of GRBs is dominated by the
synchrotron radiation, we calculate the synchrotron luminosity of GRBs from
their total isotropic energy and burst duration. Intriguingly, we discover a
uniform correlation between the synchrotron luminosity and Doppler factor,
L_syn \propto D^3.1, for GRBs and blazars, which suggests that they may share
some similar jet physics. One possible reason is that GRBs and blazars have,
more or less, similar intrinsic synchrotron luminosities and both of them are
strongly enhanced by the beaming effect. After Doppler and redshift-correction,
we find that the intrinsic peak energy of the GRBs ranges from 0.1 to 3 keV
with a typical value of 1 keV. We further correct the beaming effect for the
observed luminosity of GRBs and find that there exists a positive correlation
between the intrinsic synchrotron luminosity and peak energy for GRBs, which is
similar to that of blazars. Our results suggest that both the intrinsic
positive correlation and the beaming effect may be responsible for the observed
tight correlation between the isotropic energy and the peak energy in GRBs (so

YBa2(Cu1-yZny)3O7-d compounds over a wide range of hole concentration, p, and
Zn content (y). Zn induced rate of suppression of Tc, dTc(p)/dy, was found to
be strongly p-dependent and showed a monotonic variation with p, except in the
vicinity of p ~ 0.125, i.e., near the so-called 1/8th anomaly where the
charge/spin stripe correlations are at their strongest in hole doped cuprates.
The magnitude of dTc(p)/dy decreased significantly around this hole
concentration implying that Zn suddenly became less effective in degrading Tc
near the 1/8th anomaly for La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4. The same feature, somewhat at a
reduced scale, was also observed for YBa2(Cu1-yZny)3O7-d compounds. This is
counterintuitive since static stripe order itself degrades superconducting
order. We have discussed the possible scenarios that can give rise to such a
non-monotonic dTc(p)/dy near p ~ 0.125. We have also looked at the p-dependent
characteristic pseudogap energy scale, {\epsilon}g(p), which shows a nearly
linear decrease with increasing p without any noticeable feature at p ~ 0.125.
Moreover, there is no significant effect of Zn content on the value of
{\epsilon}g(p). All these observations are indicative of a complex and possibly
competing interplay among the superconducting, pseudogap, and stripe
correlations in the hole doped cuprates.

the other hand, kinetic temperature averaged over the whole GM-B, 25 K, is

service providers (WSPs) face critical challenges in provisioning spectrum
resource. Given the permission of unlicensed access to TV white spaces, WSPs
can alleviate their burden by exploiting the concept of ""capacity offload"" to
transfer part of their traffic load to unlicensed spectrum. For such use cases,
a central problem is for WSPs to coexist with others, since all of them may
access the unlicensed spectrum without coordination thus interfering each
other. Game theory provides tools for predicting the behavior of WSPs, and we
formulate the coexistence problem under the framework of non-cooperative games
as a capacity offload game (COG). We show that a COG always possesses at least
one pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE), and does not have any mixed-strategy
NE. The analysis provides a full characterization of the structure of the NEs
in two-player COGs. When the game is played repeatedly and each WSP
individually updates its strategy based on its best-response function, the
resulting process forms a best-response dynamic. We establish that, for
two-player COGs, alternating-move best-response dynamics always converge to an
NE, while simultaneous-move best-response dynamics does not always converge to
an NE when multiple NEs exist. When there are more than two players in a COG,
if the network configuration satisfies certain conditions so that the resulting
best-response dynamics become linear, both simultaneous-move and
alternating-move best-response dynamics are guaranteed to converge to the
unique NE.

properties of both the energy spectrum of closed graphene billiards and the

we use the semiclassical Green's function for ballistic graphene flakes that we
have derived in Reference 1. First we study the spectral two point correlation
function, or more precisely its Fourier transform the spectral form factor,
starting from the graphene version of Gutzwiller's trace formula for the
oscillating part of the density of states. We calculate the two leading order
contributions to the spectral form factor, paying particular attention to the
influence of the edge characteristics of the system. Then we consider transport
properties of open graphene cavities. We derive generic analytical expressions
for the classical conductance, the weak localization correction, the size of
the universal conductance fluctuations and the shot noise power of a ballistic
graphene cavity. Again we focus on the effects of the edge structure. For both,
the conductance and the spectral form factor, we find that edge induced
pseudospin interference affects the results significantly. In particular
intervalley coupling mediated through scattering from armchair edges is the key
mechanism that governs the coherent quantum interference effects in ballistic
graphene cavities.

cutaneous force feedback are substituted by cutaneous feedback (CF) only,
provided by two wearable devices able to apply forces to the index finger and
the thumb, while holding a handle during a teleoperation task. The force
pattern, fed back to the user while using the cutaneous devices, is similar, in
terms of intensity and area of application, to the cutaneous force pattern
applied to the finger pad while interacting with a haptic device providing both
cutaneous and kinesthetic force feedback. The pattern generated using the
cutaneous devices can be thought as a subtraction between the complete haptic
feedback (HF) and the kinesthetic part of it. For this reason, we refer to this
approach as sensory subtraction instead of sensory substitution. A needle
insertion scenario is considered to validate the approach. The haptic device is
connected to a virtual environment simulating a needle insertion task.
Experiments show that the perception of inserting a needle using the
cutaneous-only force feedback is nearly indistinguishable from the one felt by
the user while using both cutaneous and kinesthetic feedback. As most of the
sensory substitution approaches, the proposed sensory subtraction technique
also has the advantage of not suffering from stability issues of teleoperation
systems due, for instance, to communication delays. Moreover, experiments show
that the sensory subtraction technique outperforms sensory substitution with
more conventional visual feedback (VF).

therefore a purely gravitational hair. The black holes are constructed as a
warped product of a two-dimensional space-time, which resembles the r-t plane
of the BTZ black hole, times a warp factor multiplying the metric of a
D-2-dimensional Euclidean base manifold, which is restricted by a scalar
equation. It is shown that all the Noether charges vanish. Furthermore, this is
consistent with the Euclidean action approach: even though the black hole has a
finite temperature, both the entropy and the mass vanish. Interesting examples
of base manifolds are given in eight dimensions which are products of Thurston
geometries, giving then a nontrivial topology to the black hole horizon. The

the Crab Nebula taken at low zenith angles to assess the performance of the
MAGIC stereo system. The trigger threshold of the MAGIC telescopes is 50-60
GeV. Advanced stereo analysis techniques allow MAGIC to achieve a sensitivity
as good as (0.76 +/- 0.03)% of the Crab Nebula flux in 50 h of observations
above 290 GeV. The angular resolution at those energies is better than ~0.07
degree. We also perform a detailed study of possible systematic effects which
may influence the analysis of the data taken with the MAGIC telescopes.

blobs flowing outwards sequentially along a bright coronal ray in the wake of a
coronal mass ejection. The ray is believed to be associated with the current
sheet structure that formed as a result of solar eruption, and the blobs are
products of magnetic reconnection occurring along the current sheet. The ray
morphology and blob dynamics are investigated statistically. It is found that
the apparent angular widths of the rays at a fixed time vary in a range of
2.1-6.6 (2.0-4.4) degrees with an average of 3.5 (2.9) degrees at 3 (4) Rs,
respectively, and the observed durations of the events vary from 12 h to a few
days with an average of 27 h. It is also found, based on the analysis of blob
motions, that 58% (26) of the blobs were accelerated, 20% (9) were decelerated,
and 22% (10) moved with a nearly-constant speed. Comparing the dynamics of our
blobs and those that are observed above the tip of a helmet streamer, we find
that the speeds and accelerations of the blobs in these two cases differ
significantly. It is suggested that these differences of the blob dynamics stem
from the associated magnetic reconnection involving different magnetic field
configurations and triggering processes.

high-energies"", which took place at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Seattle
in Fall 2010. The principal aim of the program was to develop and sharpen the
science case for an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), a facility that will be able
to collide electrons and positrons with polarized protons and with light to
heavy nuclei at high energies, offering unprecedented possibilities for
in-depth studies of quantum chromodynamics. This report is organized around
four major themes: i) the spin and flavor structure of the proton, ii)
three-dimensional structure of nucleons and nuclei in momentum and
configuration space, iii) QCD matter in nuclei, and iv) Electroweak physics and
the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. Beginning with an executive
summary, the report contains tables of key measurements, chapter overviews for
each of the major scientific themes, and detailed individual contributions on
various aspects of the scientific opportunities presented by an EIC.

models and their numerical implementations (such as MIN3P) to simulate simple
microbial transformations in conditions of chemostat or gradostat models, that
are popular in microbial ecology and waste treatment ecosystems. To make this
comparison, we first consider an abstract ecosystem composed of a single
limiting resource and a single microbial species that are carried by advection.
In a second stage, we consider another microbial species in competition for the
same limiting resource. Comparing the numerical solutions of the two models, we
found that the numerical accuracy of simulations of advective transport models
performed with MIN3P depends on the evolution of the concentrations of the
microbial species: when the state of the system is close to a non-hyperbolic
equilibrium, we observe a numerical inaccuracy that may be due to the
discretization method used in numerical approximations of reactive transport
equations. Therefore, one has to be cautious about the predictions given by the
models.

information. We present the design and simulation of an experimental method for
entanglement estimation for a general multiqubit state. The system can be in a
pure or a mixed state, and it need not be ""close"" to any particular state. Our
method, based on dynamic learning, does not require prior state reconstruction
or lengthy optimization. Results for three-qubit systems compare favorably with
known entanglement measures. The method is then extended to four- and
five-qubit systems, with relative ease. As the size of the system grows the
amount of training necessary diminishes, raising hopes for applicability to
large computational systems.

support pervasive computing applications. We propose a new architecture
consisting of a search engine and peripheral clients that addresses issues in
scalability, data sharing, data transformation and inherent platform
heterogeneity. Key features of our application are a type-aware data transport
that is capable of extract data, and present data through handheld devices (PDA
(personal digital assistant), mobiles, etc). Pervasive computing uses web
technology, portable devices, wireless communications and nomadic or ubiquitous
computing systems. The web and the simple standard HTTP protocol that it is
based on, facilitate this kind of ubiquitous access. This can be implemented on
a variety of devices - PDAs, laptops, information appliances such as digital
cameras and printers. Mobile users get transparent access to resources outside
their current environment. We discuss our system's architecture and its
implementation. Through experimental study, we show reasonable performance and
adaptation for our system's implementation for the mobile devices.

Local consistency is one
of an ideal property of Monte Carlo method. However, it may fail to hold local
consistency for several reason. In fact, in practice, it is more important to
study such a non-ideal behavior. We call local degeneracy for one of a
non-ideal behavior of Monte Carlo methods. We show some equivalent conditions
for local degeneracy. As an application we study a Gibbs sampler (data
augmentation) for cumulative logit model with or without marginal augmentation.
It is well known that natural Gibbs sampler does not work well for this model.
In a sense of local consistency and degeneracy, marginal augmentation is shown
to improve the asymptotic property. However, when the number of categories is
large, both methods are not locally consistent.

with impurities $\pm i\gamma$ and hopping amplitudes $t_0 (t_b)$ for regions
outside (between) the impurity locations, we probe the origin of maximal
PT-symmetry breaking that occurs when the impurities are nearest neighbors.
Through a simple and exact derivation, we prove that the critical impurity
strength is equal to the hopping amplitude between the impurities,
$\gamma_c=t_b$, and the simultaneous emergence of $N$ complex eigenvalues is a
robust feature of any PT-symmetric hopping profile. Our results show that the
threshold strength $\gamma_c$ can be widely tuned by a small change in the
global profile of the lattice, and thus have experimental implications.

applications in 0.18um CMOS technology with load mismatch protection and power
control features. The breakdown induced by load mismatch can be avoided by
attenuating the RF power to the final stage during over voltage conditions.
Power control is realized by means of ""open loop"" techniques to regulate the
power supply voltage, and a novel controllable bias network with temperature
compensated is proposed, which allows a moderate power control slope (dB/V) to
be achieved. Post-layout Simulation results show that the level of output power
can be controlled in 2dBm steps; especially the output power in every step is
quite insensitive to temperature variations.

communication in which either a network or a wireless node changes its
transmission or reception parameters to communicate efficiently avoiding
interference with licensed or unlicensed users. In this work, a fuzzy logic
based system for spectrum management is proposed where the radio can share
unused spectrum depending on some parameters like distance, signal strength,
node velocity and availability of unused spectrum. The system is simulated and
is found to give satisfactory results.
