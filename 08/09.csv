solutions of field theories when turning on an interaction. A nonlinear
interaction term generates harmonics analogous to those observed in nonlinear
optical media. This calls for a generalization to anharmonic waves in both
classical and quantum field theory. Three simple requirements make anharmonic
waves compatible with relativistic field theory and quantum physics. Some
non-essential concepts have to be abandoned, such as orthogonality, the
superposition principle, and the existence of single-particle energy
eigenstates. The most general class of anharmonic waves allows for a zero
frequency term in the Fourier series, which corresponds to a quantum field with
a non-zero vacuum expectation value. Anharmonic quantum fields are defined by
generalizing the expansion of a field operator into creation and annihilation
operators. This method provides a framework for handling exact quantum fields,
which define exact single particle states.

Hierarchical Smoothing problem. Given a directed acyclic graph and a
non-negative value, called target value, for each vertex in the graph, we wish
to find non-negative values for the vertices satisfying a certain constraint
while minimizing the distance of these assigned values and the target values in
the lp-norm. The constraint is that the value assigned to each vertex should be
no less than the sum of the values assigned to its children. We motivate this
problem with applications in information retrieval and web mining. While our
problem can be solved in polynomial time using linear programming, given the
input size in these applications such a solution might be too slow. We mainly
study the \ell_1-norm case restricting the underlying graphs to rooted trees.
For this case we provide an efficient algorithm, running in O(n^2) time. While
the algorithm is purely combinatorial, its proof of correctness is an elegant
use of linear programming duality. We believe that our approach may be
applicable to similar problems, where comparable hierarchical constraints are
involved, e.g. considering the average of the values assigned to the children
of each vertex. While similar in flavor to other smoothing problems like
Isotonic Regression (see for example [Angelov et al. SODA'06]), our problem is

turbulence. This turbulence is generated behind the outer shock and propagates
into the bubble volume, leading to a non-trivial spatial variation of the
electron spectral index. Rather than a constant volume emissivity as predicted

also reproduce the observed sharp edges of the bubbles. We comment on possible

under quite general conditions. Informally speaking, the obstructions to
perfect matchings are geometric, and are of two distinct types: 'space
barriers' from convex geometry, and 'divisibility barriers' from arithmetic
lattice-based constructions. To formulate precise results, we introduce the
setting of simplicial complexes with minimum degree sequences, which is a
generalisation of the usual minimum degree condition. We determine the
essentially best possible minimum degree sequence for finding an almost perfect
matching. Furthermore, our main result establishes the stability property:
under the same degree assumption, if there is no perfect matching then there
must be a space or divisibility barrier. This allows the use of the stability
method in proving exact results. Besides recovering previous results, we apply
our theory to the solution of two open problems on hypergraph packings: the
minimum degree threshold for packing tetrahedra in 3-graphs, and Fischer's
conjecture on a multipartite form of the Hajnal-Szemer\'edi Theorem. Here we
prove the exact result for tetrahedra and the asymptotic result for Fischer's
conjecture; since the exact result for the latter is technical we defer it to a
subsequent paper.

introduced, and it has been argued that they should play as central a role as
that played by particles or ordinary branes. In this article we show that in
the presence of a Chern-Simons coupling, a magnetically charged extended event
emits an extended object, which geometrically is just like a Dirac string, but
it is observable, obeys equations of motion, and may be electrically charged.
We write a complete action principle which accounts for this effect. The action
involves two Chern-Simons terms, one integrated over spacetime and the other
integrated over the worldvolume of the submanifold that is the union of the
Dirac world-sheet and the history of the emitted physical object. By demanding
that the total charge emitted by a composite extended magnetic event be
quantized according to Dirac's rule, we find a quantization condition for the
Chern-Simons coupling. For a 1-form electric potential in D=2n+1 spacetime
dimensions, the composite event is formed by n elementary extended magnetic
events separated in time such that the product of their transverse spaces,
together with the time axis, is the entire spacetime. We show that the emitted
electric charge is given by the integral of the (n-1)-th exterior power of the
electromagnetic field strength over the last elementary event, or,
equivalently, over an appropriate closed surface. The extension to more general
p-form potentials and higher dimensions is also discussed. For the case D=11,
p=3, our result for the quantization of the Chern-Simons coupling was obtained
previously in the context of M-theory, a remarkable agreement that makes the
existence of events even more compelling.

of $n$ strategic agents report their \emph{locations} and a mechanism
determines, either deterministically or randomly, the location of the facility.
Game theoretic perspectives of the facility location problem advanced in two
main directions. The first direction is concerned with the characterization of
\emph{strategyproof} (SP) mechanisms; i.e., mechanisms that induce truthful
reporting as a dominant strategy; and the second direction quantifies how well
various objective functions can be approximated when restricted to SP
mechanisms. The current paper provides contributions in both directions. First,
we construct a parameterized randomized SP mechanism, and show that all of the
previously proposed deterministic and randomized SP mechanisms for the current
settings can be formalized as special cases of this mechanism. Second, we give
tight results for the approximation ratio of SP mechanisms with respect to the
objective of minimizing the sum of squares of distances to the agents
(\emph{miniSOS}). Holzman \cite{Holzman1990} provided an axiomatic foundation
for this function, showing that it is the unique function that satisfies
unanimity, continuity and invariance. We devise a randomized mechanism that
gives a 1.5-approximation for the miniSOS function, and show that no other
randomized SP mechanism can provide a better approximation. This mechanism
chooses the average location with probability 1/2 and a \emph{random dictator}
with probability 1/2. For deterministic mechanisms, we show that the median
mechanism provides a 2-approximation, and this is tight. Together, our study
provides fundamental understanding of the miniSOS objective function and makes
a step toward the characterization of randomized SP facility location
mechanisms.

unmagnetized nonthermal plasma consisting of negatively charged dust grains,
adiabatic positive ions and nonthermal electrons. For isothermal electrons, the
present plasma system does not support any double layer solution, whereas for
nonthermal electrons, negative potential double layer starts to occur whenever
the nonthermal parameter exceeds a critical value. However this double layer
solution is unable to restrict the occurrence of all negative potential
solitary waves of the present system. As a result, two different types of
negative potential solitary waves have been observed, in which occurrence of
first type of solitary wave is restricted by M_c<M<M_D whereas the second type
solitary wave exists for all M>M_D, where M_c is the lower bound of Mach number
M and M_D(>M_c) is the Mach number corresponding to a negative potential double
layer. A finite jump between the amplitudes of negative potential of solitary
waves at M=M_D-\epsilon_1 and at M=M_D+\epsilon_2 has been observed, where
0<\epsilon_1<M_D-M_c and \epsilon_2>0. An analytical theory for the existence
of double layer has been presented. A numerical scheme has also been provided
to find the value of Mach number at which double layer solution exists and also
the amplitude of that double layer. Although the occurrence of coexistence of
solitary structures of both polarities is restricted by M_c<M <= M_max, only
negative potential solitary wave still exists for all M>M_max, where M_max is
the upper bound of M for the existence of positive potential solitary waves
only. Qualitatively different compositional parameter spaces showing the nature
of existing solitary structures of the energy integral have been found. These
solution spaces are capable of producing new results and physical ideas for the

describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize
the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not
continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email,
text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or
practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for
non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at
hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals
is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the
temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems
interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of
patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we
present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for
analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their
relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional
network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when
things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself.
Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not
necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite
different from those for static networks.

Steiner-Triple-System is defined as follows. Begin with a complete graph on $n$
vertices and proceed to remove the edges of triangles one at a time, where each
triangle removed is chosen uniformly at random out of all remaining triangles.
This stochastic process terminates once it arrives at a triangle-free graph,
and a longstanding open problem is to estimate the final number of edges, or
equivalently the time it takes the process to conclude. The intuition that the
edge distribution is roughly uniform at all times led to a folklore conjecture
that the final number of edges is $n^{3/2+o(1)}$ with high probability, whereas
the best known upper bound is $n^{7/4+o(1)}$. It is no coincidence that various
methods break precisely at the exponent 7/4 as it corresponds to the inherent
barrier where co-degrees become comparable to the variations in their values
that arose earlier in the process.
  In this work we significantly improve upon the previous bounds by
establishing that w.h.p. the number of edges in the final graph is at most $
n^{5/3+o(1)} $. Our approach relies on a system of martingales used to control
key graph parameters, where the crucial new idea is to harness the
self-correcting nature of the process in order to control these parameters well
beyond the point where their early variation matches the order of their
expectation.

of NGC 4395, this constitutes the first reported detection of CO. In general,
the CO emission is faint, as may be expected from their less-than-spectacular

that power active galactic nuclei by exchanging angular momentum with disk gas.
Here we show that an individual NCO undergoing runaway outward migration
comparable to Type III protoplanetary migration can generate an accretion rate
corresponding to Seyfert AGN or quasar luminosities. Multiple migrating NCOs in
an AGN disk can dominate traditional viscous disk accretion and at large disk
radii, ensemble NCO migration and accretion could provide sufficient heating to
prevent the gravitational instability from consuming disk gas in star
formation. The magnitude and energy of the X-ray soft excess observed at
~0.1-1keV in Seyfert AGN could be explained by a small population of
~10^{2}-10^{3} accreting stellar mass black holes or a few ULXs. NCO migration
and accretion in AGN disks are therefore extremely important mechanisms to add

conditions, we observe a critical influence of the competition rate $p$ on the
stability of spiral waves and on the emergence of biodiversity. In particular,
while increasing values of $p$ promote biodiversity, they may act detrimental
on spatial pattern formation. For random initial conditions, we observe a phase
transition from biodiversity to an absorbing phase, whereby the critical value
of mobility grows linearly with increasing values of $p$ on a log-log scale,
but then saturates as $p$ becomes large. For prepared initial conditions, we
observe the formation of single-armed spirals, but only for values of $p$ that
are below a critical value. Once above, the spirals break up and form
disordered spatial structures, mainly because of the percolation of vacant
sites. Thus, there exists a critical value of the competition rate $p_{c}$ for
stable single-armed spirals in finite populations. Importantly though, $p_{c}$
increases with increasing system size, because noise reinforces the
disintegration of ordered patterns. In addition, we also find that $p_{c}$
increases with the mobility. These phenomena are reproduced by a deterministic
model that is based on nonlinear partial differential equations. Our findings
indicate that competition is vital for the sustenance of biodiversity and
emergence of pattern formation in ecosystems governed by cyclical interactions.

Eulerian and Lagrangian methods in a single computational technique. The
employed grid is defined as the Voronoi tessellation of a set of
mesh-generating points which can move along with the flow, yielding an
automatic adaptivity of the mesh and a substantial reduction of advection
errors. Our scheme solves the MHD Riemann problem in the rest frame of the
Voronoi interfaces using the HLLD Riemann solver. To satisfy the divergence
constraint of the magnetic field in multiple dimensions, the Dedner divergence
cleaning method is applied. In a set of standard test problems we show that the

field is kept sufficiently small to closely preserve the correct physical
solution. We also apply the code to two first application problems, namely
supersonic MHD turbulence and the spherical collapse of a magnetized cloud. We

gravitational potential on subhorizon scales. The growth in the gravitational
potential occurs on timescales << H^(1). This effect is present even when the
quintessence parameters are chosen to reproduce an expansion history consistent
with observations. For linearized fluctuations, we find that although the
gravitational potential power spectrum is enhanced in a scale-dependent manner,
the shape of the dark matter/galaxy power spectrum is not significantly
affected. We find that the best constraints on such a transition in the
quintessence field is provided via the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in
the CMB temperature power spectrum. Going beyond the linearized regime, the

gas physics on the vertical heating and thickening of disc galaxies during
minor mergers. For the first time we present a suite of simulations that
includes a diffuse, rotating, cooling, hot gaseous halo, as predicted by
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations as well as models of galaxy formation.
We study the effect of this new gaseous component on the vertical structure of
a Milky Way-like stellar disc during 1:10 and 1:5 mergers. For 1:10 mergers we
find no increased final thin disc scale height compared to the isolated
simulation, leading to the conclusion that thin discs can be present even after
a 1:10 merger if a reasonable amount of hot gas is present. The reason for this
is the accretion of new cold gas, leading to the formation of a massive new
thin stellar disc that dominates the surface brightness profile. In a previous
study, in which we included only cold gas in the disk, we showed that the
presence of cold gas decreased the thickening by a minor merger relative to the
no-gas case. Here, we show that the evolution of the scale height in the
presences of a cooling hot halo is dominated by the formation of the new
stellar disc. In this scenario, the thick disc is the old stellar disc that has
been thickened in a minor merger at z>1, while the thin disc is the new stellar
disc that reforms after this merger. In addition, we study the evolution of the
scale height during a 1:5 merger and find that a thin disc can be present even
after this merger, provided enough hot gas is available. The final scale height
in our simulations depends on the mass of the hot gaseous halo, the efficiency
of the winds and the merger mass ratio. We find post-merger values in the range
0.5<z0<1.0 kpc in good agreement with observational constraints by local
galaxies.

their study in this range crucial for constraining the models. Observations

spectral range that will be covered by ALMA. The catalogue of mm/submm
observations collected here is the largest to date and is composed of 102 GRBs,
of which 88 had afterglow observations, whereas the rest are host galaxy
searches. With our programmes, we contributed with data of 11 GRBs and the
discovery of 2 submm counterparts. In total, the full sample, including data
from the literature, has 22 afterglow detections with redshift ranging from
0.168 to 8.2. GRBs have been detected in mm/submm wavelengths with peak
luminosities spanning 2.5 orders of magnitude, the most luminous reaching
10^33erg s^-1 Hz^-1. We observe a correlation between the X-ray brightness at
0.5 days and the mm/submm peak brightness. Finally we give a rough estimate of
the distribution of peak flux densities of GRB afterglows, based on the current
mm/submm sample. Observations in the mm/submm bands have been shown to be
crucial for our understanding of the physics of GRBs, but have until now been
limited by the sensitivity of the observatories. With the start of the
operations at ALMA, the sensitivity will be increased by more than an order of

anisotropic and frustrated by further neighbour interactions. Mean field theory
suggests a ground state with 4-sublattice zig-zag magnetic order in a parameter
regime that can be relevant to the honeycomb iridate compound Na2IrO3, where

insufficient to draw robust conclusions about the roles of tidal interaction

values of parameters in the analytical functions given the observed
eccentricities. These analytical functions can be used in theoretical
investigations or as priors for the eccentricity distribution when analyzing

longitudes in the inner Galaxy. We have detected the NH3(1,1) line towards 72%
of our targets (456), demonstrating that the high column density features
identified in the BGPS and other continuum surveys accurately predict the
presence of dense gas. We have determined kinematic distances and resolved the
distance ambiguity for all BGPS sources detected in NH3. The BGPS sources trace
the locations of the Scutum and Sagittarius spiral arms, with the number of
sources peaking between Galactocentric radii of 4-5 kpc. We measure the
physical properties of each source and find that depending on the distance,
BGPS sources are primarily clumps, with some cores and clouds. We have examined
the physical properties as a function of Galactocentric distance, and find a
mean gas kinetic temperature of 15.6 K, and that the NH3 column density and
abundance decrease by nearly an order of magnitude between Galactocentric radii
of 3 - 11 kpc. Comparing sources at similar distances demonstrates that the
physical properties are indistinguishable, which suggests a similarity in clump
structure across the Galactic disk. We have also compared the BGPS sources to
criteria for efficient star formation presented independently by Heiderman et
al. and Lada et al., and massive star formation presented by Kauffmann et al.
48% of our sample should be forming stars (including massive stars) with high
efficiency, and 87% contain subregions that should be efficiently forming
stars. Indeed, we find that 67% of the sample exhibit signs of star formation
activity based on an association with a mid-IR source.

null cone in a generic curved spacetime. They develop ""tails,"" traveling at all
speeds equal to and less than unity. If sizeable, this off-the-null-cone effect
could mean objects at cosmological distances, such as supernovae, appear dimmer
than they really are. Their light curves may be distorted relative to their
flat spacetime counterparts. These in turn could affect how we infer the
properties and evolution of the universe or the objects it contains. Within the
gravitational context, the tail effect induces a self-force that causes a
compact object orbiting a massive black hole to deviate from an otherwise
geodesic path. This needs to be taken into account when modeling the
gravitational waves expected from such sources. Motivated by these
considerations, we develop perturbation theory for solving the massless scalar,
photon and graviton retarded Green's functions in perturbed spacetimes,
assuming these Green's functions are known in the background spacetime. In
particular, we elaborate on the theory in perturbed Minkowski spacetime in
significant detail; and apply our techniques to compute the retarded Green's
functions in the weak field limit of the Kerr spacetime to first order in the
black hole's mass and angular momentum. Our methods build on and generalizes

over cosmological distances, within a spatially flat inhomogeneous
Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. This perturbative
scheme applied to the graviton Green's function, when pushed to higher orders,

quasi-circular orbits. Our implementation can be regarded as a subset of the
ppE formalism developed by Yunes and Pretorius, being able to investigate also
next-to-leading order effects. In order to find error distributions for the
alternative theory parameters, we use the Fisher information formalism and
carry out Monte Carlo simulations for 17 different binary black hole mass
configurations in the range 10^5 Msun < M < 10^8 Msun with 10^3 randomly
distributed points in the parameter space each, comparing the full (FWF) and
restricted (RWF) version of the gravitational waveform. We find that the
binaries can roughly be separated into two groups: one with low (< ~10^7 Msun)
and one with high total masses (> ~10^7 Msun). The RWF errors on the
alternative theory parameters are two orders of magnitude higher than the FWF
errors for high-mass binaries while almost comparable for low-mass binaries.
Due to dilution of the available information, the accuracy of the binary
parameters is reduced by factors of a few, except for the luminosity distance
which is affected more seriously in the high-mass regime. As an application and
to compare our research with previous work, we compute an optimal lower bound

gamma-ray luminosity is $\sim$ $1 \times 10^{33}$erg s$^{-1}$ between 1--100

originate in interactions between particles accelerated in the SNR and
interstellar gas or radiation fields adjacent to the shock regions. The decay
of neutral pions produced in nucleon-nucleon interactions between accelerated
hadrons and interstellar gas provides a reasonable explanation for the

feature in the central perturbations induced by the binary systems commonly
appears in a constant range where the size of the caustic induced by the binary
companion is between 1.5 and 1.9 times of the diameter of the source, whereas
in the central perturbations induced by the planetary systems the feature
commonly appears in a range where the ratio of the size of the caustic induced
by the planet to the source diameter changes with the planet/primary mass
ratio. High-magnification events caused by the binary and planetary systems
with the characteristic feature produce a distinctive short-duration bump in
the residuals from the single-lensing light curve, where the bump occurs near
the time of peak magnification of the events. Because of a well-known
planet/binary degeneracy, we compare binary- and planetary-lensing events with
the short-duration bump in the residuals. As a result, we find the features of
the binary-lensing events that are discriminated from the planetary-lensing
events despite the moderately strong finite-source effect and thus can be used
to immediately distinguish between the binary and planetary companions. We also
find the feature that appears only in binary-lensing events with a very low
mass ratio or planetary-lensing events. This implies that the lens systems with
the feature have a very low mass binary companion (such as a brown dwarf) or a
planet.

control, in which the control at each vehicle only depends on the information
from its neighbors in an information graph. We consider a D-dimensional lattice
as information graph, of which the 1-D platoon is a special case. The stability
margin is measured by the real part of the least stable eigenvalue of the
closed-loop state matrix, which quantifies the rate of decay of initial errors.
In [1], it was shown that with symmetric control, in which two neighbors put
equal weight on information received from each other, the stability margin of a
1-D vehicular platoon decays to 0 as O(1/N^2), where N is the number of
vehicles. Moreover, a perturbation analysis was used to show that with
vanishingly small amount of asymmetry in the control gains, the stability
margin scaling can be improved to O(1/N). In this paper, we show that, with
judicious choice of non-vanishing asymmetry in control, the stability margin of
the closed loop can be bounded away from zero uniformly in N. Asymmetry in
control gains thus makes the control architecture highly scalable. The results
are also generalized to D-dimensional lattice information graphs that were
studied in [2], and the correspondingly stronger conclusions than those derived
in [2] are obtained. In addition, we show that the size-independent stability
margin can be achieved with relative position and relative velocity (RPRV)
feedback as well as relative position and absolute velocity (RPAV) feedback,
while the analysis in [1], [2] was only for the RPAV case.

Moreover, we show that intuition and approximations derived from asymptotic

finite samples, even for moderate to large sample sizes. In contrast, we show
via simulation that performance on a variety of metrics is improved and
asymptotic approximations are applicable for smaller sample sizes when the

particularly apparent when the process is mean square differentiable or the

of frustration related slow magnetic fluctuations. ESR experiments show a
multi-step magnetic and spin chirality ordering process. For temperatures above
30 K, the weak temperature dependence of the ESR linewidth $\Delta
H_{pp}\propto T^{-p}$ with $p=0.8$ evidences the development of short-range
correlated spin clusters. The critical broadening with $p =1.8$, persisting
down to 14 K, indicates the coexistence of the short-range ordered spin
clusters within a helically ordered state. Below 9.5 K, the anomalously large
decrease of the linewidth reveals the stabilization of a long-range ordered
state with one chirality.

connection between these effects is complex, involving: (1) thermal
equilibration between sample and substrate; (2) spin currents along the height

studies in detail the first of these steps, and outlines the other two steps.
Thermal equilibration processes between the magnons and phonons in the sample,
as well as between the sample and the substrate leads to two surface modes,
with surface lengths $\lambda$, to provide for thermal equilibration.
Increasing the coupling between the two modes increases the longer mode length
and decreases the shorter mode length. The applied thermal gradient along $x$
leads to a thermal gradient along $z$ that varies as $\sinh{(x/\lambda)}$,
which can in turn produce fluxes of the carriers of up- and down- spins along
$z$, and gradients of their associated \textit{magnetoelectrochemical
potentials} $\bar{\mu}_{\uparrow,\downarrow}$, which vary as
$\sinh{(x/\lambda)}$. By the inverse spin Hall effect, this spin current along
$z$ can produce a transverse (along $y$) voltage difference $\Delta V_y$, which

considerable investigation, and observational limits on their strength are
required to constrain the theory. Due to their impact on the reionization
process, the strength of primordial fields can be limited using the latest data
on reionization and the observed UV-luminosity function of high-redshift
galaxies. Given the steep faint-end slope of the luminosity function, faint
galaxies contribute substantial ionizing photons, and the low-luminosity cutoff
has an impact on the total budget thereof. Magnetic pressure from primordial
fields affects such cutoff by preventing collapse in halos with mass below
10^{10} M_solar (B_0 / 3 nG)^3, with B_0 the co-moving field strength. In this
letter, the implications of these effects are consistently incorporated in a

supertropical semirings, which have been introduced and used by the first and
the third authors for refinements of tropical geometry and matrix theory in
[IR1]-[IR3], and then studied by us in a systematic way in [IKR1]-[IKR3] in
connection with ""supervaluations"".
  In the present paper we establish a category $\STROP_m$ of supertropical
monoids by choosing as morphisms the ""transmissions"", defined in the same way
as done in [IKR1] for supertropical semirings. The previously investigated
category $STROP$ of supertropical semirings is a full subcategory of $STROP_m.$
Moreover, there is associated to every supertropical monoid $V$ a supertropical
semiring $\hat V$ in a canonical way.
  A central problem in [IKR1]-[IKR3] has been to find for a supertropical
semiring $U$ the quotient $U/E$ by a ""TE-relation"", which is a certain kind of
equivalence relation on the set $U$ compatible with multiplication (cf. [IK1,
Definition 4.5]). It turns out that this quotient always exists in $\STROP_m$.
In the good case, that $U/E$ is a supertropical semiring, this is also the
right quotient in $\STROP.$ Otherwise, analyzing $(U/E)^\wedge,$ we obtain a
mild modification of $E$ to a TE-relation $E'$ such that $U/E' = (U/E)^\wedge$
in $\STROP.$
  In this way we now can solve various problems left open in [IKR1], [IKR2] and
gain further insight into the structure of transmissions and supervaluations.
Via supertropical monoids we also obtain new results on totally ordered
supervaluations and monotone transmissions studied in [IKR3].

deaths will result from lung cancer alone. Genetic information is an extremely
valuable data source in characterizing the personal nature of cancer. Over the
past several years, investigators have conducted numerous association studies
where intensive genetic data is collected on relatively few patients compared
to the numbers of gene predictors, with one scientific goal being to identify
genetic features associated with cancer recurrence or survival. In this note,
we propose high-dimensional survival analysis through a new application of
boosting, a powerful tool in machine learning. Our approach is based on an
accelerated lifetime model and minimizing the sum of pairwise differences in
residuals. We apply our method to a recent microarray study of lung
adenocarcinoma and find that our ensemble is composed of 19 genes, while a
proportional hazards (PH) ensemble is composed of nine genes, a proper subset
of the 19-gene panel. In one of our simulation scenarios, we demonstrate that
PH boosting in a misspecified model tends to underfit and ignore
moderately-sized covariate effects, on average. Diagnostic analyses suggest
that the PH assumption is not satisfied in the microarray data and may explain,
in part, the discrepancy in the sets of active coefficients. Our simulation
studies and comparative data analyses demonstrate how statistical learning by
PH models alone is insufficient.

to repulsion of eigenfrequencies. The participation ratio for the major part of

argument may be used to establish the stability of the set of minimisers as a

The magnetic fields chosen do not have any finite/infinite discontinuity for
finite values of the radial coordinate. The novelty of the two magnetic fields
is related to the equations which are used to find the excited spectra of the

presence of the $1/r$ (inverse-radial) magnetic field. For the other magnetic
field profile one can use the knowledge of the bound state spectrum of a
two-dimensional cut-off Coulomb potential to dictate the excitation spectra of

  Protocol For Wireless Sensor Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beaconless position-based forwarding protocols have recently evolved as a
promising solution for packet forwarding in wireless sensor networks. However,
as the node density grows, the overhead incurred in the process of relay
selection grows significantly. As such, end-to-end performance in terms of
energy and latency is adversely impacted. With the motivation of developing a
packet forwarding mechanism that is tolerant to node density, an alternative
position-based protocol is proposed in this paper. In contrast to existing
beaconless protocols, the proposed protocol is designed such that it eliminates
the need for potential relays to undergo a relay selection process. Rather, any
eligible relay may decide to forward the packet ahead, thus significantly
reducing the underlying overhead. The operation of the proposed protocol is
empowered by exploiting favorable features of orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) at the physical layer. The end-to-end performance of the
proposed protocol is evaluated against existing beaconless position-based
protocols analytically and as well by means of simulations. The proposed
protocol is demonstrated in this paper to be more efficient. In particular, it
is shown that for the same amount of energy the proposed protocol transports
one bit from source to destination much quicker.

the choice of the renormalization scheme. In the linear version of the model

  We show that if a polynomial upper bound on the size of the network n is

  Finally, if we assume nodes have access to synchronized clocks or we consider

that can predict endeffector trajectories and joint excursions consistent with

inherent in these multi-joint tasks there are an infinite number of postures
that could be adopted to complete them. By developing models to simulate
full-body reaching movements in 3D space we can begin to explore cost functions
that may be used by the central nervous system to plan and execute these
movements. Methods A robust simulation model was developed using 1)
graphic-based modeling tools to generate an inverse dynamics controller
(SimMechanics), 2) controller parameterization methods, and 3) cost function
criteria. An adaptive weight coefficient based on the final motor task error
(i.e. distance between end-effector and target at the end of movement) was
proposed to balance motor task error and physiological cost terms (e.g. joint
power). The output of the simulation models using different cost controller
functions based on motor task error or motor task error and various
physiological cost terms (e.g. joint power, center of mass displacement) were
compared to experimental data from 15 healthy participants performing full body
reaching movements. Results In sum, the best fit to the experimental data was
obtained by minimizing motor task error, joint power, and center of mass
displacement. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the
proposed method is effective for the simulation of large-scale human skeletal
systems. Conclusions This method can reasonably predict the whole body reaching
movements including final postures, joint power and movement of COM using
simple algebraic calculations of inverse dynamics and forward kinematics.

the choice of models. We find systematic variations exist at the 0.06 dex level

effects our final gradients depend only on abundances derived herein. A simple
linear fit to the Cepheid data from 398 stars yields a gradient d[Fe/H]/dRG =
-0.062 \pm 0.002 dex/kpc which is in good agreement with previously determined
values. We have also reexamined the region of the ""metallicity island"" of Luck

slightly decreases the reconnection rate and the magnetic reconnection
evolution depends mainly on the lighter H+ ion species in the presented
simulations. Second, the Hall magnetic field is characterized by a two-scale
structure in presence of O+ ions: it reaches sharp peak values in a small area
in proximity of the neutral line, and then decreases slowly over a large
region. Third, the two background species initially separate in the outflow
region because H+ and O+ ions are accelerated by different mechanisms occurring
on different time scales and with different strengths. Fourth, the effect of a
guide field on the O+ dynamics is studied: the O+ presence does not change the
reconnected flux and all the characteristic features of guide field magnetic
reconnection are still present. Moreover, the guide field introduces an O+
circulation pattern between separatrices that enhances high O+ density areas
and depletes low O+ density regions in proximity of the reconnection fronts.
The importance and the validity of these results are finally discussed.

Web search and online advertising are implemented using inverted indices. An
inverted index represents a sparse term-document matrix, where non-zero

present an approach for lossless compression of inverted indices. Our approach
maps terms in a document corpus to a new term space in order to reduce the
number of non-zero elements in the term-document matrix, resulting in a more
compact inverted index. We formulate the problem of selecting a new term space
that minimizes the resulting index size as a matrix factorization problem, and
prove that finding the optimal factorization is an NP-hard problem. We develop
a greedy algorithm for finding an approximate solution. A side effect of our
approach is increasing the number of terms in the index, which may negatively
affect query evaluation performance. To eliminate such effect, we develop a
methodology for modifying query evaluation algorithms by exploiting specific
properties of our compression approach. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves an index size reduction of 20%, while
maintaining the same query response times. Higher compression ratios up to 35%
are achievable, however at the cost of slightly longer query response times.
Furthermore, combining our approach with other lossless compression techniques,
namely variable-byte encoding, leads to index size reduction of up to 50%.
