orbiting different types of stars in both the visible and near infrared
wavelength range. We use a one-dimensional radiative-convective steady-state
atmospheric model coupled with a parametric cloud model, based on observations
in the Earth's atmosphere to study the effect of both cloud types on the
reflection spectra and albedos of Earth-like extrasolar planets at low
resolution for various types of central stars. We find that the high scattering
efficiency of clouds substantially causes both the amount of reflected light
and the related depths of the absorption bands to be substantially larger than
in comparison to the respective clear sky conditions. Low-level clouds have a
stronger impact on the spectra than the high-level clouds because of their much
larger scattering optical depth. The detectability of molecular features in
near the UV - near IR wavelength range is strongly enhanced by the presence of
clouds. However, the detectability of various chemical species in
low-resolution reflection spectra depends strongly on the spectral energy
distribution of the incident stellar radiation. In contrast to the reflection
spectra the spectral planetary albedos enable molecular features to be detected
without a direct influence of the spectral energy distribution of the stellar
radiation. Here, clouds increase the contrast between the radiation fluxes of
the planets and the respective central star by about one order of magnitude,
but the resulting contrast values are still too low to be observable with the
current generation of telescopes.

  USA, October 2010",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fact apparently not observed earlier in the literature of nonmonotonic
reasoning is that Reiter, in his default logic paper, did not directly
formalize informal defaults. Instead, he translated a default into a certain
natural language proposition and provided a formalization of the latter. A few
years later, Moore noted that propositions like the one used by Reiter are
fundamentally different than defaults and exhibit a certain autoepistemic
nature. Thus, Reiter had developed his default logic as a formalization of
autoepistemic propositions rather than of defaults.
  The first goal of this paper is to show that some problems of Reiter's
default logic as a formal way to reason about informal defaults are directly
attributable to the autoepistemic nature of default logic and to the mismatch
between informal defaults and the Reiter's formal defaults, the latter being a
formal expression of the autoepistemic propositions Reiter used as a
representation of informal defaults.
  The second goal of our paper is to compare the work of Reiter and Moore.
While each of them attempted to formalize autoepistemic propositions, the modes
of reasoning in their respective logics were different. We revisit Moore's and
Reiter's intuitions and present them from the perspective of autotheoremhood,
where theories can include propositions referring to the theory's own theorems.
We then discuss the formalization of this perspective in the logics of Moore
and Reiter, respectively, using the unifying semantic framework for default and
autoepistemic logics that we developed earlier. We argue that Reiter's default
logic is a better formalization of Moore's intuitions about autoepistemic
propositions than Moore's own autoepistemic logic.

relatively little attention so far. In this paper, we revisit the formalism of
epistemic specification. We offer a new definition of the formalism, propose
several semantics (one of which, under syntactic restrictions we assume, turns
out to be equivalent to the original semantics by Gelfond), derive some

independent of the strength and multipolarity of the couplings induced. The
exception is for cases in which there is an s-wave coupled to the ground state
of the core, the proton system is loosely bound, and the states have large

structure, we allow inelastic collisions above an activation threshold. When
the medium allows finite dissipation, we find that the shock waves are unstable
and form distinctive high density non-uniformities and convective rolls on
their surface. Using analytical and numerical results for the shock Hugoniot,
we show that both DK and BZT instabilities can be ruled out. Instead, the
results suggest that the clustering instability of Goldhirsch and Zanetti in
dissipative gases is the dominant mechanism.

dynamic programming to determine optimal policies for controlled Markov chains.
In this paper, we provide a method to construct sub-optimal policies along with
a bound for the deviation of such a policy from the optimum via a linear
programming approach. The state-space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go
or value function is approximated by a constant over each partition. By
minimizing a non-negative cost function defined on the partitions, one can
construct an approximate value function which also happens to be an upper bound
for the optimal value function of the original Markov Decision Process (MDP).
As a key result, we show that this approximate value function is {\it
independent} of the non-negative cost function (or state dependent weights as
it is referred to in the literature) and moreover, this is the least upper
bound that one can obtain once the partitions are specified. Furthermore, we
show that the restricted system of linear inequalities also embeds a family of
MDPs of lower dimension, one of which can be used to construct a lower bound on
the optimal value function. The construction of the lower bound requires the
solution to a combinatorial problem. We apply the linear programming approach
to a perimeter surveillance stochastic optimal control problem and obtain
numerical results that corroborate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

Tevatron suggest that new-physics may be playing a role in t-tbar production.
To better understand the source of the asymmetry, recent proposals have called
for a measurement of the bottom and charm forward-backward asymmetries at the
Tevatron, using jets with embedded muons. Here we propose a corresponding
measurement of the bottom quark forward-central asymmetry designed to look for
similar effects in the b-sector at ATLAS and CMS. We construct a set of cuts
designed to enhance sensitivity to this asymmetry, and test our analysis on a
toy axigluon model representative of those used to explain the top asymmetry.
We find that if the relevant new-physics couplings to the bottom quark are
similar to those of the top, then the effects should be visible at the two
sigma level in less than 10 fb-1 of 7 TeV LHC data. Such a measurement would be
of general importance, and would provide valuable model-building input, serving
to restrict the set of models put forward to explain the Tevatron t-tbar
anomaly. However, a relatively low trigger threshold on non-isolated muons
inside hard jets must be maintained to allow for this measurement.

information is gathered about the local minima that are reached after passing
the anticrossing non-adiabatically. This information is then used to penalize
pathways to the corresponding local minima, by adjusting the initial

We generate 64-qubit random instances of the maximum independent set problem,

at an initially linear 3D null point that is stressed by a localised shear
motion across the spine axis. The fan plane is not rotationally symmetric and
this allows for different behaviours depending on the alignment of the fan
plane relative to the imposed driver direction. Aims. The aim is to show how
the current accumulation and the associated reconnection process depends on the
relative orientation between the driver imposed stress across the spine axis of
the null and the main eigenvector direction in the fan plane. Methods. The time
evolution of the 3D null point is investigated solving the 3D non-ideal MHD
equations numerically in a Cartesian box. The magnetic field is frozen to the
boundaries and the boundary velocity is only non-zero where the imposed driving
is for stressing the system is applied. Results. The current accumulation is
found to be along the direction of the fan eigenvector associated with the
smallest eigenvalue until the direction of the driver is almost parallel to
this eigenvector. When the driving velocity is parallel to the weak eigenvector
and has an impulsive temporal profile the null only forms a weak current layer.
However, when the null point is stressed continuously boundary effects
dominates the current accumulation. Conclusions. There is a clear relation
between the orientation of the current concentration and the direction of the
fan eigenvector corresponding to the small eigenvalue. This shows that the
structure of the magnetic field is the most important in determining where
current is going to accumulate when a single 3D null point is perturbed by a
simple shear motion across the spine axis. As the angle between the driving
direction and the strong eigenvector direction increases, the current that
accumulates at the null becomes progressively weaker.

consequence of a self-limiting profile that develops, respectively, at the
bottom of V-grooves and inverted pyramids. Our model is based on a system of
reaction-diffusion equations, one for each crystallographic facet that defines
the pattern, and include the group III precursors, their decomposition and
diffusion kinetics (for which we discuss the experimental evidence), and the
subsequent diffusion and incorporation kinetics of the group-III atoms released
by the precursors. This approach can be applied to any facet configuration,
including pyramidal quantum dots, but we focus on the particular case of
V-groove templates and offer an explanation for the self-limited profile and
the Ga segregation observed in the V-groove. The explicit inclusion of the
precursor decomposition kinetics and the diffusion of the atomic species
revises and generalizes the earlier work of Basiol et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81,
2962 (1998); Phys. Rev. B 65, 205306 (2002)] and is shown to be essential for
obtaining a complete description of self-limiting growth. The solution of the
system of equations yields spatially resolved adatom concentrations, from which
average facet growth rates are calculated. This provides the basis for
determining the conditions that yield selflimiting growth. The foregoing
scenario, previously used to account for the growth modes of vicinal GaAs(001)

patterned with V-grooves, can be used to describe the morphological evolution

particle-hole pairs that lead to the emergence of a non-local string order in
one dimension. Using high-resolution imaging of low-dimensional quantum gases
in an optical lattice, we directly detect these pairs with single-site and
single-particle sensitivity and observe string order in the one-dimensional
case.

mathematics and also feature extensively in scientific applications. In modern
high-dimensional applications, a common approach to finding sparse positive
definite matrices is to threshold their small off-diagonal elements. This
thresholding, sometimes referred to as hard-thresholding, sets small elements
to zero. Thresholding has the attractive property that the resulting matrices
are sparse, and are thus easier to interpret and work with. In many
applications, it is often required, and thus implicitly assumed, that
thresholded matrices retain positive definiteness. In this paper we formally
investigate the algebraic properties of p.d. matrices which are thresholded. We
demonstrate that for positive definiteness to be preserved, the pattern of
elements to be set to zero has to necessarily correspond to a graph which is a
union of disconnected complete components. This result rigorously demonstrates
that, except in special cases, positive definiteness can be easily lost. We
then proceed to demonstrate that the class of diagonally dominant matrices is
not maximal in terms of retaining positive definiteness when thresholded.
Consequently, we derive characterizations of matrices which retain positive
definiteness when thresholded with respect to important classes of graphs. In
particular, we demonstrate that retaining positive definiteness upon
thresholding is governed by complex algebraic conditions.

extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  Our motivating problem is learning a labeling function in R^n, which is
determined by an unknown k-dimensional subspace. This problem of learning a
k-subspace junta is a common generalization of learning a k-junta (a function
of k coordinates in R^n) and learning intersections of k halfspaces. In this
context, we introduce an irrelevant noisy attributes model where the
distribution over the ""relevant"" k-dimensional subspace is independent of the
distribution over the (n-k)-dimensional ""irrelevant"" subspace orthogonal to it.
  We give a spectral tensor algorithm which identifies the relevant subspace,
and thereby learns k-subspace juntas under some additional assumptions. We do
this by exploiting the structure of local optima of higher moment tensors over
the unit sphere; PCA finds the global optima of the second moment tensor
(covariance matrix). Our main result is that when the distribution in the
irrelevant (n-k)-dimensional subspace is any Gaussian, the complexity of our
algorithm is T(k,\epsilon) + \poly(n), where T is the complexity of learning
the concept in k dimensions, and the polynomial is a function of the
k-dimensional concept class being learned. This substantially generalizes
existing results on learning low-dimensional concepts.

associated with ultraviolet or infrared bright galaxies, suggesting an extreme
starburst event or accretion onto a central black hole. Another possibility is
gas that is shock excited by supernovae. However some blobs are not associated
with galaxies, and may instead be heated by gas falling into a dark matter
halo. The polarization of the Ly-alpha emission can in principle distinguish
between these options, but a previous attempt to detect this signature returned
a null detection. Here we report on the detection of polarized Ly-alpha from
the blob LAB1. Although the central region shows no measurable polarization,
the polarized fraction (P) increases to ~20 per cent at a radius of 45 kpc,

photoionization against recombination. Our newly developed on-line reionization
simulator allows users to assess the required SFR and ionization histories,
using a variety of assumptions for galactic and stellar populations, IGM
clumping factor and temperature, and LyC escape fraction. The decline in
high-redshift galaxy candidates and Lya emitters at z = 6-8 suggests a rising
neutral fraction, with reionization at z > 7 increasingly difficult owing to
increased recombination rates and constraints from the ionizing background and
LyC mean free path. The required rate is rho_SFR = (0.018 M_sun/yr/Mpc^3)
[(1+z)/8]^3 (C_H/3)(0.2/f_esc) T_4^(-0.845) scaled to fiducial values of
clumping factor C_H = 3, escape fraction f_esc = 0.2, electron temperature T_e
= 10^4 K, and low-metallicity initial mass functions (IMF) and stellar
atmospheres. Our hydrodynamical + N-body simulations find a mean clumping
factor C_H = (2.9)[(1+z)/6]^-1.1 in the photoionized, photoheated filaments at
z = 5-9. The critical SFR could be reduced by increasing the minimum stellar
mass, invoking a top-heavy IMF, or systematically increasing f_esc at high z.

reionization, producing tau_e = 0.050 back to z_rei = 7, augmented by

observables that probe two-dimensional topological order through binding of the
zero-energy modes. We analytically demonstrate that pi-flux hosts a Kramers
pair of zero modes in the topological Gamma (Berry phase skyrmion at the zero
momentum) and M (Berry phase skyrmion at a finite momentum) phases of the M-B
model introduced for the HgTe quantum spin Hall insulator. Furthermore, we
analytically show that the dislocation acts as a pi-flux, but only so in the M
phase. Our numerical analysis confirms this through a Kramers pair of zero
modes bound to a dislocation appearing in the M phase only, and further
demonstrates the robustness of the modes to disorder and the Rashba coupling.
Finally, we conjecture that by studying the zero modes bound to dislocations
all translationally distinguishable two-dimensional topological band insulators
can be classified.

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). Deep, targeted observations with the SZA allow
us to probe a broader range of cluster spatial scales, better disentangle
cluster decrements from radio point source emission, and derive more robust
integrated SZE flux and mass estimates than we can with ACT data alone. For the
two clusters we detect with the SZA we compute integrated SZE signal and derive
masses from the SZA data only. ACT-CL J2337+0016, also known as Abell 2631, has
archival Chandra data that allow an additional X-ray-based mass estimate.
Optical richness is also used to estimate cluster masses and shows good
agreement with the SZE and X-ray-based estimates. Based on the point sources
detected by the SZA in these three cluster fields and an extrapolation to ACT's
frequency, we estimate that point sources could be contaminating the SZE
decrement at the <= 20% level for some fraction of clusters.

the MHD solver in FLASH 3.3, we compare several sub-resolution approaches to

various models to magnetize the cluster medium, and assess the sensitivity of
these models to their underlying subgrid parameters. We find that magnetized
jet-based models suffer a severe reduction in accretion rate compared to
hydrodynamic jets; however, bubble models remain largely unaffected. While both
jets and sporadically-placed bubbles have difficulty reproducing the observed
strength and topology of cluster magnetic fields, models based on
centrally-located bubbles come closest to observations. Finally, whereas jet
models are relatively insensitive to changes in their subgrid parameters, the
accretion rate and average magnetic field produced by the bubbles vary by as
much as an order of magnitude depending on the grid resolution and accretion
strength.

Such an evolution follows from a modified theory of gravity of the type
$f(R)=\beta R^n$, and it is showed that the spectrum of created particles is
$\beta$ independent. We find that greater the value of $n$ smaller is the
number of created particles. We study in detail the spectrum of the total
particle number created for $n=1\pm \varepsilon$, with $\varepsilon = 0.1$, a
very small deviation from the standard general relativity case ($n=1$). We find
that such a very small deviation causes a great difference in the total
particle number, of about one order of magnitude as compared to the standard
general relativity. Our calculations are based on the method of instantaneous
Hamiltonian diagonalization, where the vacuum states are defined as those which
minimizes the energy at a particular instant of time. The spectrum of the total
number and total energy of created particles can be determined exactly for any
value of the physical time in a matter dominated universe. We also find that
the main contribution to the total number of particles and total energy comes
from small wavenumbers $k$ and for particles with large values of $k$ the
contribution is very small.

the SDSS low-redshift galaxy sample (z<0.05). Out of 1636 galaxies with SDSS
photometry, we identify 48 detections; out of the 1063 galaxies that also have
SDSS spectroscopy, we identify 33 detections. We find that maser detection rate
is higher at higher optical luminosity (M_B), larger velocity dispersion
($\sigma$), and higher [OIII]5007 luminosity, with [OIII]5007 being the
dominant factor. These detection rates are essentially the result of the
correlations of isotropic maser luminosity with all three of these variables.
These correlations are natural if maser strength increases with central black
hole mass and the level of AGN activity. We also find that the detection rate
is higher in galaxies with higher extinction. Based on these results, we
propose that maser surveys seeking to efficiently find masers should rank AGN
targets by extinction-corrected [OIII]5007 flux when available. This
prioritization would improve maser detection efficiency, from an overall ~ 3%
without pre-selection to ~ 16% for the strongest intrinsic [OIII]5007 emitters,

aspect is the role of photo-excited hot carriers in charge and energy transport
at graphene interfaces. Here, we perform time-resolved (~250 fs) scanning
photocurrent microscopy on a tunable graphene pn junction. The ultrafast
pump-probe measurements yield a photocurrent response time of ~1.5 ps at room
temperature increasing to ~4 ps at 20 K. Combined with the negligible
dependence of photocurrent amplitude on environmental temperature this implies
that hot carriers rather than phonons dominate energy transport at high
frequencies. Gate-dependent pump-probe measurements demonstrate that both
thermoelectric and built-in electric field effects contribute to the
photocurrent excited by laser pulses. The relative weight of each contribution
depends on the junction configuration. A single laser beam excitation also
displays multiple polarity-reversals as a function of carrier density, a
signature of impact ionization. Our results enhance the understanding of
non-equilibrium electron dynamics, electron-electron interactions, and
electron-phonon interactions in graphene. They also determine fundamental
limits on ultrafast device operation speeds (~500 GHz) for potential
graphene-based photon detection, sensing, and communication.

formation of spectral lines in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) using 3D
hydrodynamical and 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres of red giant stars.
Continuum flux levels, spectral line profiles and curves of growth for
different species are compared with calculations that treat scattering as
absorption. Photons may escape from deeper, hotter layers through scattering,
resulting in significantly higher continuum flux levels beneath a wavelength of
5000 A. The magnitude of the effect is determined by the importance of
scattering opacity with respect to absorption opacity; we observe the largest
changes in continuum flux at the shortest wavelengths and lowest metallicities;
intergranular lanes of 3D models are more strongly affected than granules.
Continuum scattering acts to increase the profile depth of LTE lines: continua
gain more brightness than line cores due to their larger thermalization depth
in hotter layers. We thus observe the strongest changes in line depth for
high-excitation species and ionized species, which contribute significantly to
photon thermalization through their absorption opacity near the continuum
optical surface. Scattering desaturates the line profiles, leading to larger
abundance corrections for stronger lines, which reach -0.5 dex at 3000 A for Fe
II lines in 3D with excitation potential 2 eV at [Fe/H]=-3.0. The corrections
are less severe for low-excitation lines, longer wavelengths, and higher
metallicity. Velocity fields increase the effects of scattering by separating
emission from granules and intergranular lanes in wavelength. 1D calculations
exhibit similar scattering abundance corrections for weak lines, but those for
strong lines are generally smaller compared to 3D models and depend on the
choice of microturbulence.

  Our approach is to generalize the checkerboard decompositions of alternating

decomposition of their complement. We employ normal surface theory to establish
a dictionary between the pieces of the JSJ decomposition of the surface

like canonical coherent states are generated by canonical kinematical
variables. Although all classical and quantum formalisms normally entail
canonical variables, it is shown that affine variables can serve equally well
for many classical and quantum studies. This general purpose analysis provides
tools to discuss two major applications: (1) the completely successful
quantization of a nonrenormalizable scalar quantum field theory by affine
techniques, in complete contrast to canonical techniques which only offer
triviality; and (2) a formulation of the kinematical portion of quantum gravity
that favors affine kinematical variables over canonical kinematical variables,
and which generates a framework in which a favorable analysis of the
constrained dynamical issues can take place. All this is possible because of
the close connection between the affine and the canonical stories, while the
few distinctions can be used to advantage when appropriate.

melting point of all the naturally occurring stable phases of CuTi alloys do
not show a definite trend with gradual increase in Ti concentration. To
understand the phenomenon, super cells of CuTi alloy are constructed where Cu
atom is substituted by Ti randomly and at selective sites. For random
substitution, the melting point decreases linearly with increase in Ti
concentration. A non-monotonous dependence is seen when Cu atoms at selective
sites are replaced by Ti. For a particular doping concentration, the melting
point shows a wide range of variation depending on the order of atomic
arrangement, and can be fine tuned by selecting the sites for substitution. The
variations in melting points in different cases are explained in terms of the
peak height, width and position of the corresponding radial distribution
functions. Finally, it is verified that initial structures of the naturally

to consider various numerical approaches: the finite difference method, the
spectral element method, the boundary element method, the finite element
method, the finite volume method, etc. All these methods have various
advantages and drawbacks. The amplification of seismic waves in surface soil
layers is mainly due to the velocity contrast between these layers and,
possibly, to topographic effects around crests and hills. The influence of the
geometry of alluvial basins on the amplification process is also know to be
large. Nevertheless, strong heterogeneities and complex geometries are not easy
to take into account with all numerical methods. 2D/3D models are needed in
many situations and the efficiency/accuracy of the numerical methods in such
cases is in question. Furthermore, the radiation conditions at infinity are not
easy to handle with finite differences or finite/spectral elements whereas it
is explicitely accounted in the Boundary Element Method. Various absorbing
layer methods (e.g. F-PML, M-PML) were recently proposed to attenuate the
spurious wave reflections especially in some difficult cases such as shallow
numerical models or grazing incidences. Finally, strong earthquakes involve
nonlinear effects in surficial soil layers. To model strong ground motion, it
is thus necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of soils and
simultaneously investigate seismic wave propagation in complex 2D/3D geological
structures! Recent advances in numerical formulations and constitutive models
in such complex situations are presented and discussed in this paper. A crucial
issue is the availability of the field/laboratory data to feed and validate
such models.

for the three-dimensional leader follower formation control of unmanned
helicopters. The proposed hybrid control framework captures internal
interactions between the decision making unit and the path planner continuous
dynamics of the system, and hence improves the system's overall reliability. To
design such a hybrid controller, a spherical abstraction of the state space is
proposed as a new method of abstraction. Utilizing the properties of
multi-affine functions over the partitioned space leads to a finite state
Discrete Event System (DES) model, which is shown to be bisimilar to the
original continuous-variable dynamical system. Then, in the discrete domain, a
logic supervisor is modularly designed for the abstracted model. Due to the
bisimilarity between the abstracted DES model and the original UAV dynamics,
the designed logic supervisor can be implemented as a hybrid controller through
an interface layer. This supervisor drives the UAV dynamics to satisfy the
design requirements. In other words, the hybrid controller is able to bring the
UAVs to the desired formation starting from any initial state inside the
control horizon and then, maintain the formation. Moreover, a collision
avoidance mechanism is embedded in the designed supervisor. Finally, the
algorithm has been verified by a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform,
which is developed for unmanned helicopters. The presented results show the
effectiveness of the algorithm.

two-dimensional turbulent fluid flows where they often emerge on time-scales
much shorter than the viscous time scale, and then dominate the dynamics for
very long time intervals. In this paper we propose a dynamical systems
explanation of the metastability of an explicit family of solutions, referred
to as bar states, of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation
on the torus. These states are physically relevant because they are associated
with certain maximum entropy solutions of the Euler equations, and they have
been observed as one type of metastable state in numerical studies of
two-dimensional turbulence. For small viscosity (high Reynolds number), these
states are quasi-stationary in the sense that they decay on the slow, viscous
timescale. Linearization about these states leads to a time-dependent operator.
We show that if we approximate this operator by dropping a higher-order,
non-local term, it produces a decay rate much faster than the viscous decay
rate. We also provide numerical evidence that the same result holds for the
full linear operator, and that our theoretical results give the optimal decay
rate in this setting.

modelling approach for biological systems. In this paper we develop an
abstraction theory for asynchronous multi-valued network models that allows the
state space of a model to be reduced while preserving key properties of the
model. The abstraction theory therefore provides a mechanism for coping with
the state space explosion problem and supports the analysis and comparison of
multi-valued networks. We take as our starting point the abstraction theory for
synchronous multi-valued networks which is based on the finite set of traces
that represent the behaviour of such a model. The problem with extending this
approach to the asynchronous case is that we can now have an infinite set of
traces associated with a model making a simple trace inclusion test infeasible.
To address this we develop a decision procedure for checking asynchronous
abstractions based on using the finite state graph of an asynchronous
multi-valued network to reason about its trace semantics. We illustrate the
abstraction techniques developed by considering a detailed case study based on
a multi-valued network model of the regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in
Escherichia coli.

the associated acceptor-hole wavefunction tends to be more localized around the
Mn than for an impurity in bulk GaAs. The magnetic anisotropy energy for

not possess spherical symmetry. This hints that a modified gravity with
difference to Newtonian inverse-square law at large scale, and less symmetry is
worth investigating. In this paper, we study the dynamics in Randers-Finsler

work out the long-term effects that such a putative modification of the usual
Newtonian inverse-square law would induce on the trajectory of a test particle
orbiting a central mass. Without making any a-priori simplifying assumptions
concerning the orbital configuration of the test particle, it turns out that
its osculating semi-major axis a, eccentricity e, pericenter \varpi and mean

the node \Omega are left unaffected. Moreover, the radial and the transverse

particular focus on their global properties, as opposed to the microphysics
such as that needed for magnetic reconnection or particle acceleration as such.
Indeed solar flares will always remain in the domain of remote sensing, so we
cannot observe the microscales directly and must understand the basic physics
entirely via the global properties plus theoretical inference. The global
observables include the general energetics -radiation in flares and mass loss
in coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - and the formation of different kinds of
ejection and global wave disturbance: the type II radio-burst exciter, the
Moreton wave, the EIT ""wave,"" and the ""sunquake"" acoustic waves in the solar
interior. Flare radiation and CME kinetic energy can have comparable
magnitudes, of order 10^32 erg each for an X-class event, with the bulk of the
radiant energy in the visible-UV continuum. We argue that the impulsive phase
of the flare dominates the energetics of all of these manifestations, and also

for strongly decelerating ejecta on the scale of several hundred
milli-arcsecond, never observed in X-ray binaries before. Although the distance
of the source is not well constrained, it is clear that these ejectas are at
least mildly relativistic at the early stages. Moreover, we show the large

band (0.3-0.7 keV) lags are detected over all the four observations, in the
frequency range $\nu \lsim 6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz, where hard lags, similar to
those observed in black hole X-ray binaries, are usually detected in smaller

in the parent Kerr geometry become highly focused along the principal outgoing

Poisson (1990) regarding inflation in rotating black holes are reviewed, and
shown to be based on Raychauduri's equation applied along the outgoing and

almost shear-free. A full set of shear-free equations is derived. A specific
line-element is proposed, which is argued should provide a satisfactory
approximation during early inflation. Finally, it is argued that

entropy production, bringing inflation to an end, and precipitating collapse.

cloud core is investigated by three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations.
Starting from the prestellar cloud core, the star formation process is
calculated until the end of the main accretion phase. In the calculations, the
mass of the prestellar cloud is parameterized. During the star formation, the
protostellar outflow is driven by the circumstellar disk. The outflow extends
also in the transverse direction until its width becomes comparable to the
initial cloud scale, and thus, the outflow has a wide opening angle of >40
degrees. As a result, the protostellar outflow sweeps up a large fraction of
the infalling material and ejects it into the interstellar space. The outflow
can eject at most over half of the host cloud mass, significantly decreasing
star formation efficiency. The outflow power is stronger in clouds with a
greater initial mass. Thus, the protostellar outflow effectively suppresses
star formation efficiency in a massive cloud. The outflow weakens significantly
and disappears in several free-fall timescales of the initial cloud after the
cloud begins to collapse. The natal prestellar core influences the lifetime and
size of the outflow. At the end of the main accretion phase, a massive
circumstellar disk comparable in mass to the protostar remains. Calculations
show that typically, ~30% of the initial cloud mass is converted into the
protostar and ~20% remains in the circumstellar disk, while ~40% is ejected
into the interstellar space by the protostellar outflow. Therefore, a single
cloud core typically has a star formation efficiency of 30-50%.

two-dimensional hexagonal crystal unlike any other. Here we exhibit some of the

are considered a consequence of the influence of the environment of the
physical systems. We regard the multiplicity of states with a definite energy
value as a result of internal probabilistic processes in the macrosystem; these
internal probabilistic processes are not taken into account by quantum
mechanics. On a simple example it is demonstrated, that canonical distribution
is not independent and equal to microcanonical one, but is a result of
averaging by microcanonical ensemble.

thermodynamic system imply the new concept of {\it equipartition of energy
bound} (EEB) or, more generally, a thermodynamical bound for the {\it
partition} of energy. We theorized and discussed the possibility to put an
upper limit to the equipartition factor for a fluid of particles. This could be
interpreted as a sort of transcription of the entropy bounds from
quantum-holographic sector: the EEB number $\pi^{2}/2 = 4.93$, obtained from a
comparison between the Margolus-Levitin quantum theorem and the TTT bound for
relaxation times by Hod, seems like a special value for the thermodynamics of
particle systems. This bound has been related to the idea of an extremal
statistics and independently traced in a statistical mechanics framework,
analyzing the mathematical behavior of the distributions which obey to a
thermodynamical statistics with a power law greater than the planckian one.
