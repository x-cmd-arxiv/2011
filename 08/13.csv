Observatory of the long period dwarf nova RU Peg. RU Peg contains a massive
white dwarf, possibly the hottest white dwarf in a dwarf nova, it has a low
inclination, thus optimally exposing its X-ray emitting boundary layer, and has
an excellent trigonometric parallax distance. We modeled the X-ray data using
XSPEC assuming a multi-temperature plasma emission model built from the MEKAL
code. We obtained a maximum temperature of 31.7 keV, based on the EPIC MOS1, 2
and pn data, indicating that RU Peg has an X-ray spectrum harder than most
dwarf novae, except U Gem. This result is consistent with and indirectly
confirms the large mass of the white dwarf in RU Peg. The X-ray luminosity we
computed corresponds to a boundary layer luminosity for a mass accretion rate
of 2.E-11 Msun/yr (assuming Mwd=1.3Msun), in agreement with an expected
quiescent accretion rate. The modeling of the O VIII emission line at 19A as
observed by the RGS implies a projected stellar rotational velocity of 695
km/s, i.e. the line is emitted from material rotating at about 936-1245 km/s
(for i about 34-48deg) or about 1/6 of the Keplerian speed; this velocity is
much larger than the rotation speed of the white dwarf inferred from the FUSE
spectrum. Cross-correlation analysis yielded an undelayed component and a
delayed component of 116 +/- 17 sec where the X-ray variations/fluctuations
lagged the UV variations. This indicates that the UV fluctuations in the inner
disk are propagated into the X-ray emitting region in about 116 sec. The
undelayed component may be related to irradiation effects.

an applied electric and tilted magnetic field can, surprisingly, become more
pronounced as the lattice and conduction electron temperature increases from
4.2 K to room temperature and beyond. It has previously been demonstrated that
at certain critical field parameters, the semiclassical trajectories of
electrons in the lowest miniband of the superlattice change abruptly from fully
localised to completely unbounded. The unbounded electron orbits propagate
through intricate web patterns, known as stochastic webs, in phase space, which
act as conduction channels for the electrons and produce a series of resonant
peaks in the electron drift velocity versus electric field curves. Here, we
show that increasing the lattice temperature strengthens these resonant peaks
due to a subtle interplay between thermal population of the conduction channels
and transport along them. This enhances both the electron drift velocity and
the influence of the stochastic webs on the current-voltage characteristics,
which we calculate by making self-consistent solutions of the coupled electron
transport and Poisson equations throughout the superlattice. These solutions
reveal that increasing the temperature also transforms the collective electron
dynamics by changing both the threshold voltage required for the onset of
self-sustained current oscillations, produced by propagating charge domains,
and the oscillation frequency.

quantum theory. Exploring such quantum-classical correspondences in a more

aspects and has attracted a great deal of attention - starting from the early
days of quantum theory. While it is often highlighted that quantum to classical
transition occurs in the limit hbar tending to zero, several objections have
been raised about its suitability in some physical contexts. Ehrenfest's
theorem is another widely discussed classical limit - however, its inadequacy
has also been pointed out in specific examples. It has been proposed that since
a quantum mechanical wave function inherits an intrinsic statistical behavior,
its classical limit must correspond to a classical ensemble - not an individual
particle. This opens up the question ""how would uncertainty relations of
canonical observables compare themselves in quantum and classical realms?"" In
this paper we explore parallels between uncertainty relations in stationary
states of quantum systems and that in the corresponding classical ensemble. We
confine ourselves to one dimensional conservative systems and show, with the
help of suitably defined dimensionless physical quantities, that first and
second moments of the canonical observables match with each other in classical
and quantum descriptions - resulting in an identical structure for uncertainty
relations in both the realms.

  To our knowledge, works which have implemented a bit-vector representation of
points-to sets so far, allocates bits for each pointer without considering
pointer's type. By considering the type, we are able to allocate bits only for
a subset of all abstract objects which are of compatible type with the
pointer's type and as a consequence improve the memory usage and running time.
To achieve this goal, we number abstract objects in a way that all the abstract
objects of a type and all of its sub-types be consecutive in order.
  Our most efficient implementation uses about 2.5 times less memory than
hybrid points-to set (default points-to set in Spark) and also improves the

While the optimization conditions vary depending on the underlying photon-pair

directions, using a new variant of the k-means clustering algorithm. On boosted
top benchmark samples from the BOOST2010 workshop, we demonstrate that a simple
cut on the 3-subjettiness to 2-subjettiness ratio yields 20% (50%) tagging
efficiency for a 0.23% (4.1%) fake rate, making N-subjettiness a highly
effective boosted top tagger. N-subjettiness can be modified by adjusting an
angular weighting exponent, and we find that the jet broadening measure is
preferred for boosted top searches. We also explore multivariate techniques,
and show that additional improvements are possible using a modified Fisher
discriminant. Finally, we briefly mention how our minimization procedure can be
extended to the entire event, allowing the event shape N-jettiness to act as a
fixed N cone jet algorithm.

reasonably well described by a thermal single-particle density matrix that
takes the initial single particle conservation laws into account. The

SDSS galaxies with a close companion (rp < 80 kpc, Delta V < 200 km/s), we
classify AGN based either on emission line ratios or on spectral classification
as a quasar. The AGN fraction in the close pairs sample is compared to a
control sample of 110,600 mass- and redshift-matched control galaxies with no
nearby companion. We find a clear increase in the AGN fraction in close pairs
of galaxies with projected separations < 40 kpc by up to a factor of 2.5
relative to the control sample (although the enhancement depends on the chosen
S/N cut of the sample). The increase in AGN fraction is strongest in equal mass
galaxy pairings, and weakest in the lower mass component of an unequal mass
pairing. The increased AGN fraction at small separations is accompanied by an
enhancement in the number of `composite' galaxies whose spectra are the result
of photoionization by both AGN and stars. Our results indicate that AGN
activity occurs (at least in some cases) well before final coalescence and
concurrently with ongoing star formation. Finally, we find a marked increase at
small projected separations of the fraction of pairs in which BOTH galaxies
harbour AGN. We demonstrate that the fraction of double AGN exceeds the
expected random fraction, indicating that some pairs undergo correlated nuclear
activity. Taken together with complimentary studies, we favour an
interpretation where interactions trigger AGN, but are not the only cause of

dipolar response of hydrated proteins. The effective dielectric constant of the
solvated protein, representing the average dipole moment induced at the protein
by a uniform external field, shows a remarkable variation among the proteins
studied by numerical simulations. It changes from 0.5 for ubiquitin to 640 for
cytochrome c. The former value implies a negative dipolar susceptibility of
ubiquitin, that is a dia-electric dipolar response and negative
dielectrophoresis. It means that a protein carrying an average dipole of ~240 D
is expected to repel from the region of a stronger electric field. This outcome
is the result of a negative cross-correlation between the protein and water
dipoles, compensating for the positive variance of the protein dipole in the
overall dipolar susceptibility. This phenomenon can be characterized as
overscreening of protein's dipole by the hydration shell. In contrast to the
neutral ubiquitin, charged proteins studied here show para-electric dipolar
response and positive dielectrophoresis. The protein-water dipolar
cross-correlations are long-ranged, extending approximately 2 nm from the
protein surface into the bulk. The analysis of numerical simulations suggests
that the polarization of the protein-water interface is strongly affected by
the distribution of the protein surface charge. This component of the protein
dipolar response gains in importance for high frequencies, above the protein
Debye peak, when the response of the protein dipole becomes dynamically
arrested. The interface response found in simulations suggests a possibility of
a positive increment of the high-frequency dielectric constant of the solution
compared to the dielectric constant of the solvent, in support of the observed
THz absorbance of protein solutions.

develop a corresponding lattice-based algorithm for the latter problem. In

performed in the effective point spread function (ePSF) formalism using our own

are members of Leo II that are brighter than magnitude 25 in the F814W band. We
identify 17 compact extra-galactic sources, for which we measure a systemic
proper motion relative to this stellar reference grid. We derive a proper
motion [\mu_{\alpha},\mu_{\delta}]=[+104+/-113,-33+/-151] microarcseconds/yr
for Leo II in the heliocentric reference frame. Though marginally detected, the
proper motion yields constraints on the orbit of Leo II. Given a distance of
230 Kpc and a heliocentric radial velocity +79 km/s, and after subtraction of
the solar motion, our measurement indicates a total orbital motion
266.1+/-128.7 km/s in the Galactocentric reference frame, with a radial
component +21.5+/-4.3 km/s and tangential component 265.2+/-129.4 km/s. The
small radial component indicates that Leo II either has a low-eccentricity
orbit, or is currently close to perigalacticon or apogalacticon distance. We
see evidence for systematic errors in the astrometry of the extragalactic
sources which, while close to being point sources, are slightly resolved in the
HST images. We argue that more extensive observations at later epochs will be
necessary to better constrain the proper motion of Leo II. We provide a
detailed catalog of the stellar and extragalactic sources identified in the HST

investigated by numerical calculations. Starting from an initial Gaussian
function, these wave packets form into annular peaks that propagate to all
directions like ripple-rings on water surface. At the beginning, electronic
probability alternates between the central peak and the ripple-rings and
transient oscillation occurs at the center. As time increases, the ripple-rings
propagate at the fixed Fermi speed, and their widths remain unchanged. The
axial symmetry of the energy dispersion leads to the circular symmetry of the
wave packets. The fixed speed and widths, however, are attributed to the
linearity of the energy dispersion. Interference between states that
respectively belong to two branches of the energy dispersion leads to multiple
ripple-rings and the probability-density oscillation. In a magnetic field,
annular wave packets become confined and no longer propagate to infinity. If
the initial Gaussian width differs greatly from the magnetic length, expanding
and shrinking ripple-rings form and disappear alternatively in a limited
spread, and the wave packet resumes the Gaussian form frequently. The
probability thus oscillates persistently between the central peak and the
ripple-rings. If the initial Gaussian width is close to the magnetic length,
the wave packet retains the Gaussian form and its height and width oscillate
with a period determined by the first Landau energy. The wave-packet evolution
is determined jointly by the initial state and the magnetic field, through the
electronic structure of graphene in a magnetic field.

in total. In spite of the many specific successes of energy landscape and other
approaches, there still seems to be some missing guiding factor that explains
how energy from diverse small sources can drive a complex molecule to a unique
state. We explore the possibility that the missing factor is in the geometry.
  A comparison of folding with other physical phenomena, together with analytic
modeling of a molecule, led us to analyze the physics of optical caustic
formation and of folding behavior side-by-side. The physics of folding and
caustics is ostensibly very different but there are several strong parallels.
This comparison emphasizes the mathematical similarity and also identifies
differences. Since the 1970's, the physics of optical caustics has been
developed to a very high degree of mathematical sophistication using
catastrophe theory. That kind of quantitative application of catastrophe theory
has not previously been applied to folding nor have the points of similarity
with optics been identified or exploited.
  A putative underlying physical link between caustics and folding is a torsion
wave of non-constant wave speed, propagating on the dihedral angles and $\Psi$
found in an analytical model of the molecule.

loss with the response of its Roche radius determines whether mass loss
persists and, if so, determines the timescale and stability of the ensuing
evolutionary phase. For giants with deep convective envelopes, the canonical
description holds that once mass transfer begins it typically proceeds
catastrophically on the dynamical timescale, as the star cannot lose sufficient
heat in order to avoid expansion. However, we demonstrate that the local
thermal timescale of the envelope's superadiabatic outer surface layer remains
comparable to that of mass loss in most cases of ""dynamical"" mass loss. We
argue therefore that if mass loss proceeds on a timescale longer than this,
then even a deep convective envelope will not dramatically expand, as the
surface layer will have time to relax thermally and reconstitute itself. We
demonstrate that in general the polytropic approximation gives much too strict
a criterion for stability, and discuss the dependence of the donor's response
on its radius in addition to its core mass. In general, we find that the
effective response of the donor on rapid timescales cannot be determined
accurately without detailed evolutionary calculations.

results for as many query intents as possible. On the other hand, they should
provide depth for each intent by displaying more than a single result. Since
both diversity and depth cannot be achieved simultaneously in the conventional
static retrieval model, we propose a new dynamic ranking approach. Dynamic
ranking models allow users to adapt the ranking through interaction, thus
overcoming the constraints of presenting a one-size-fits-all static ranking. In
particular, we propose a new two-level dynamic ranking model for presenting
search results to the user. In this model, a user's interactions with the
first-level ranking are used to infer this user's intent, so that second-level
rankings can be inserted to provide more results relevant for this intent.
Unlike for previous dynamic ranking models, we provide an algorithm to
efficiently compute dynamic rankings with provable approximation guarantees for
a large family of performance measures. We also propose the first principled
algorithm for learning dynamic ranking functions from training data. In
addition to the theoretical results, we provide empirical evidence

Although the two contacts are made of the same metal, an energy offset of 580
meV between them, ascribed to differences in the deposition techniques

the current-voltage characteristics at low voltage. A band mobility 0.13 cm2/Vs

shape of the trap distribution for energies deeper than 0.3 eV or shallower

addition NII at 121.90 micron. The CII emission is extended over a region of 7
kpc with a similar spatial morphology and kinematics to the optical H-alpha
emission. This has the profound implication that the optical hydrogen
recombination line, H-alpha, the optical forbidden lines, NII 6583 Angstrom,
the soft X-ray filaments and the far-infrared CII line all have the same energy
source. We also detect dust emission using the PACS and SPIRE photometers at

using a two-component modified black-body function and find a cold 19 K dust
component with mass 1.6x10^6 solar mass and a warm 46 K dust component with
mass 4.0x10^3 solar mass. The total FIR luminosity between 8 micron and 1000
micron is 7.5x10^8 solar luminosity, which using Kennicutt relation yields a
low star formation rate of 0.13 solar mass per yr. This value is consistent
with values derived from other tracers, such as ultraviolet emission. Combining
the spectroscopic and photometric results together with optical H-alpha, we
model emitting clouds consisting of photodissociation regions (PDRs) adjacent
to ionized regions. We show that in addition to old and young stellar
populations, there is another source of energy, such as cosmic rays, shocks or
reconnection diffusion, required to excite the H-alpha and CII filaments.

stars and stellar remnants, these stars should be rapidly rotating and hence
have hot coronae, emitting copious amounts of X-ray emission with temperatures
kT<~ a few keV. The Chandra data thus place an interesting upper limit on the
space density of (currently unobservable) low-mass main-sequence stars near Sgr
A*. This bound is close to and consistent with current constraints on the
central stellar cusp provided by infrared observations. If coronally active
stars do provide a significant fraction of the X-ray luminosity of Sgr A*, it
should be variable on hourly and daily time scales due to giant flares
occurring on different stars. Another consequence is that the quiescent X-ray
luminosity and accretion rate of the SMBH are yet lower than believed before.

  Linear Systems: A Linear Programming Approach","Report",,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present two control laws that are tailored for control
applications in which computational and/or communication resources are scarce.
Namely, we consider minimum attention control, where the `attention' that a
control task requires is minimised given certain performance requirements, and
anytime attention control, where the performance under the `attention' given by
a scheduler is maximised. Here, we interpret `attention' as the inverse of the
time elapsed between two consecutive executions of a control task. By focussing
on linear plants, by allowing for only a finite number of possible intervals
between two subsequent executions of the control task, by making a novel
extension to the notion of control Lyapunov functions and taking these novel
extended control Lyapunov function to be infinity-norm-based, we can formulate
the aforementioned control problems as online linear programs, which can be
solved efficiently. Furthermore, we provide techniques to construct suitable
infinity-norm-based extended control Lyapunov functions for our purposes.
Finally, we illustrate the resulting control laws using numerical examples. In
particular, we show that minimum attention control outperforms an alternative
implementation-aware control law available in the literature.

symmetry are well established: the way these arise in Kramers-Wannier type
local-global dualities, and as a way to encode local constraints encountered in
(doped) Mott insulators. We demonstrate that these gauge structures are closely
related, and appear as counterparts in either the canonical or
field-theoretical language. The restoration of symmetry in a disorder phase
transition is due to having the original local variables subjected to a
coherent superposition of all possible topological defect configurations, with
the effect that correlation functions are no longer well-defined. This is
completely equivalent to assigning gauge freedom to those variables. Two cases
are considered explicitly: the well-known vortex duality in bosonic Mott
insulators serves to illustrate the principle. The acquired wisdoms are then
applied to the less familiar context of dualities in quantum elasticity, where
we elucidate the relation between the quantum nematic and linearized gravity.
We reflect on some deeper implications for the emergence of gauge symmetry in
general.

Structural Operational Semantics, held on the 5th of September 2011 in Aachen,
Germany as an affiliated workshop of CONCUR 2011, the 22nd International
Conference on Concurrency Theory.
  Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework for giving
operational semantics to programming and specification languages. A growing
number of programming languages from commercial and academic spheres have been
given usable semantic descriptions by means of structural operational
semantics. Because of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural
operational semantics has found considerable application in the study of the
semantics of concurrent processes. It is also a viable alternative to
denotational semantics in the static analysis of programs, and in proving
compiler correctness. Moreover, it has found application in emerging areas of
computing such as probabilistic systems and systems biology.
  Structural operational semantics has been successfully applied as a formal
tool to establish results that hold for classes of process description
languages. This has allowed for the generalization of well-known results in the
field of process algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process
calculi based on the realization that many of the results in this field only
depend upon general semantic properties of language constructs.
  The workshop is a forum for researchers, students and practitioners
interested in new developments and directions for future investigations. One of
the specific goals of the workshop is to provide a meeting point for the
concurrency and programming language communities. Another goal is the
dissemination of the theory and practice of SOS amongst postgraduate students
and young researchers worldwide.

a union of toric varieties. Hypersurfaces are typical examples, and we study
lines on K3 surfaces and quintic Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in detail. In
particular, we combinatorially prove the existence of 2875 lines in a generic
quintic Calabi-Yau 3-fold. Also, we give a geometric construction of walls in
the Gross-Siebert construction of Calabi-Yau varieties.

nonlocal SPS type equation in balls of $\mathbb R^3$ with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. We show that for every $k\in\mathbb N$ each problem considered
admits a nodal radially symmetric solution which changes sign exacly $k$ times
in the radial variable. Moreover when the domain is the ball of $\mathbb R^3$
we obtain the existence of radial global solutions for the associated nonlocal
parabolic problem having $k+1$ nodal regions at every time.

  Suction for Unsaturated Ash-Fall Pyroclastic Soils in the Campania Region
  (Southern Italy)","23 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the territory of the Campania region (southern Italy), critical rainfall
events periodically trigger dangerous fast slope movements involving ashy and
pyroclastic soils originated by the explosive phases of the Mt. Somma-Vesuvius
volcano and deposited along the surrounding mountain ranges. In this paper, an
integration of engineering-geological and geophysical measurements is presented
to characterize unsaturated pyroclastic samples collected in a test area on the
Sarno Mountains (Salerno and Avellino provinces, Campania region). The
laboratory analyses were aimed at defining both soil water retention and
electrical resistivity curves versus water content. From the matching of the
experimental data, a direct relationship between electrical resistivity and
matric suction is retrieved for the investigated soil horizons typical of a
ash-fall pyroclastic succession. The obtained relation turns out to be helpful
in characterizing soils up to close saturation, which is a critical condition
for the trigger of slope failure. In such a regime, the water content and the
matric suction have small variations, while electrical resistivity variations
can be appreciated in a larger range of values. For this reason, besides
suction measurements on very small soil volumes through classical tensiometers,
our analyses suggest the direct monitoring of in-situ electrical resistivity
values as an effective tool to recognise the hydrological state of larger and
more representative soil volumes and to improve early warning of dangerous
slope movements.

Local Correlation Modeling (LCM) and they are compared with one another so as
to choose the best technique, that can be applied on multi-resolution satellite

evaluating the quality of image fusion (F) by using various methods including
Standard Deviation (SD), Entropy(En), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Signal-to
