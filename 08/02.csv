non-supersymmetric spectrum of 4D particles of mass M, whose 4D geometry --
{\em including loop effects} -- has a curvature that is of order R ~
m_KK^4/M_p^2, where m_KK is the extra-dimensional Kaluza-Klein scale and M_p is
the 4D Planck constant. m_KK is stabilized and can in particular satisfy m_KK
<< M. The system consists of a (5+1)-dimensional model with a flux-stabilized
supersymmetric bulk coupled to non-supersymmetric matter localized on a
(3+1)-dimensional positive-tension brane. We use recent techniques for
calculating how extra dimensions respond to changes in brane properties to show
(at the classical level) that the low-energy 4D geometry is exactly flat,
independent of the value of the brane tensions. Its mechanism for doing so is
the transfer of stabilizing flux between the bulk and the branes. The UV
completion of the model can arise at scales much larger than M, allowing the
calculation of quantum effects like the zero-point energy of very massive
particles in the vacuum. We find that brane-localized loops do not affect the
4D curvature at all, but bulk loops can. These can be estimated on general
grounds and we show that supersymmetry dictates that they generate curvatures
that are generically of order m_KK^4/M_p^2. For realistic applications this
points to a world with two supersymmetric extra dimensions, with supersymmetry
in the bulk broken at the sub-eV KK scale - as proposed in hep-th/0304256 -
requiring a 6D gravity scale somewhat higher than 10 TeV. Ordinary Standard
Model particles are brane-localized and not at all supersymmetric (implying in
particular no superpartners or the MSSM). We discuss how the model evades
various no-go theorems that would naively exclude it, and briefly outline
several striking observational implications for tests of gravity and at the
LHC.

(LLs), but radically alters the DOS by introducing a new set of peaks at
energies $E_n\pm\omega_E$, where $E_n$ is the energy of the $n$th LL. If one of
these new peaks lies sufficiently close to a LL, it causes the LL to split in
two; if the system contains an energy gap, a LL may be split in three. The new
peaks occur outside the interval $(-\omega_E,\omega_E)$, leaving the LLs in
that interval largely unaffected. If the chemical potential is greater than the
phonon frequency, the zeroth LL lies outside the interval and can be split,
eliminating its association with a single Dirac point. We find that coupling to
an extended phonon distribution such as a Lorentzian or Debye spectrum does not
qualitatively alter these results.

solutions representing unrealistic scenarios. Taking into account the dynamical
stability as an additional observable while interpreting the RV data, we can
analyse the phase space in a neighbourhood of the statistically best-fit and

Our Newtonian stable best-fit model is capable of surviving for at least 250

representations of the Lie group as physical states are defined only up to a
phase. A cornerstone theorem shows that these representations are equivalent to
the unitary representations of the central extension of the group. The
formulation of the inertial states of special relativistic quantum mechanics as
the projective representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group, and its
nonrelativistic limit in terms of the Galilei group, are fundamental examples.
Interestingly, neither of these symmetries includes the Weyl-Heisenberg group;
the hermitian representations of its algebra are the Heisenberg commutation
relations that are a foundation of quantum mechanics. The Weyl-Heisenberg group
is a one dimensional central extension of the abelian group and its unitary
representations are therefore a particular projective representation of the
abelian group of translations on phase space. A theorem involving the
automorphism group shows that the maximal symmetry that leaves invariant the
Heisenberg commutation relations are essentially projective representations of
the inhomogeneous symplectic group. In the nonrelativistic domain, we must also
have invariance of Newtonian time. This reduces the symmetry group to the
inhomogeneous Hamilton group that is a local noninertial symmetry of Hamilton's
equations. The projective representations of these groups are calculated using
the Mackey theorems for the general case of a nonabelian normal subgroup.

finite, and delay unstable otherwise. First, we show that a heavy-tailed
traffic flow is delay unstable under any scheduling policy. Then, we focus on
the celebrated Max-Weight scheduling policy, and show that a light-tailed flow

irrespective of the rate or the tail distribution of the light-tailed flow, or
other scheduling constraints in the network. Surprisingly, we show that a

heavy-tailed traffic. Furthermore, delay stability in this case may depend on
the rate of the light-tailed flow. Finally, we turn our attention to the class
of Max-Weight-a scheduling policies; we show that if the a-parameters are
chosen suitably, then the sum of the a-moments of the steady-state queue

the existence of the stress-potential coupling in lithiated-silicon; based on
the known properties of the material, the magnitude of the coupling is
estimated to be ca. 60 mV/GPa in thin-film geometry. An experimental

Groupings of patents into primary and secondary classes (co-classification) can

use and using information from patents in a different way. Policy makers may

network analysis indicates what innovation activity occurs in a countries and
which fields of technology are likely to give rise to innovative products in

modeled as a multiplicative stochastic transference of value, where each
interaction multiplies the wealth of the poorest of the two intervening agents
by a random gain eta=(1+kappa), with kappa a random return. Analyzing the
kinetic equation for the wealth distribution P(w,t), general properties are
derived for arbitrary return distributions pi(kappa). If the geometrical
average of the gain is larger than one, i.e. if <ln eta> >0, in the long time
limit a nontrivial equilibrium wealth distribution P(w) is attained. Whenever
<ln eta> <0, on the other hand, Wealth Condensation occurs, meaning that a
single agent gets the whole wealth in the long run. This concentration
phenomenon happens even if the average return <kappa> of the poor agent is
positive. In the stable phase, P(w) behaves as w^{(T-1)} for w -> 0, and we
find T exactly. This exponent is nonzero in the stable phase but goes to zero
on approach to the condensation interface. The exact wealth distribution can be
obtained analytically for the particular case of Kelly betting, and it turns
out to be exponential. We show, however, that our model is never reversible, no
matter what pi(kappa) is. In the condensing phase, the wealth of an agent with
relative rank x is found to be w(x,t) \sim e^{x t <ln eta>} for finite times t.
The wealth distribution is consequently P(w) \sim 1/w for finite times, while
all wealth ends up in the hands of a single agent for large times. Numerical
simulations are carried out, and found to satisfactorily compare with the above

low-intermediate mass stars that have undergone extensive mass-loss. The nebula
manifests itself in an extremely wide variety of shapes, but exactly how the
mass lost is shaped into such a diverse range of morphologies is still highly
uncertain despite over thirty years of vigorous debate. Binaries have long been
thought to offer a solution to this vexing problem. Now, thanks to recent
surveys and improved observing strategies, it appears clearly that a binary
channel, in particular common-envelope (CE) evolution, is responsible for a
large fraction of planetary nebulae. Moreover, as planetary nebulae are just
""fresh out of the oven"" compared to other post-CE systems, they provide
invaluable contributions to the study of common-envelope evolution and to the
formation of jets in binary systems. Our studies have also started to identify
strong links between binarity and morphology, including a high proportion of
bipolar nebulae and rings of low ionisation filaments resembling SN 1987A.
Equally important are the newly found binary CSPN with intermediate periods,
which appear linked to chemically peculiar stars whose composition was modified
by binary evolution. Their study may also reveal much information on mass and
angular momentum transfer processes in binary stars. Here we show examples of
four PNe for which we have discovered their binary nature, including the
discovery of a rare case of a barium-rich cool central star.

safety researchers with the design of countermeasures such as advanced restrain

geometrical complexity as element size decreases. These finite element models
can now capture small geometrical features with an attempt to predict fracture.
However, the bone material properties currently available, and in particular
the rate sensitivity, have been mainly determined from compression tests or
tests on long bones. There is a need for a new set of material properties for
the human rib cortical bone. With this objective, a new clamping technique was
developed to test small bone coupons under tensile loading. Ten coupons were
harvested from the cortical shell of the sixth and seventh left ribs from three
cadavers. The coupons were tested to fracture under quasi-static (target strain
rate of 0.07 %/s) and dynamic loading (target strain rate of 170 %/s). Prior to
testing, each coupon was imaged with a computed micro-tomograph to document the
bone microstructure. An optical method was used to determine the strain field
in the coupon for the quasi-static tests. The rib bone coupons were found to be
elastic, with brittle fracture. No plastic behavior was observed in this test
series. The bone coupons were assumed isotropic, homogeneous and elastic
linear, and the average Young's modulus for the quasi-static tests (13.5 GPa)
and the failure stresses (quasi-static: 112 MPa, dynamic: 124.6 MPa) were in
line with published data. Fracture however did not always occur in the gage
area where the cross-sectional area was the smallest, which contradicted the
assumption of isotropy and homogeneity. The comparison with material properties
obtained for long bones suggests that the effective cross-section has an effect
on the calculated material properties.

non-Einstein solutions is particularly connected to the question about the role
played by complex saddle points in the Euclidean path integral. Consequently,
studying (the existence of) non-locally AdS3 solutions to chiral gravity is
relevant to understand the quantum theory. Here, we discuss a special family of

axially symmetric solutions that asymptote AdS3 space without being locally

multiagent systems. Finding optimal joint actions is especially challenging
when each agent has only imperfect information about the state of its

which each agent receives private information in the form of its type. However,
representing and solving such games requires space and computation time
exponential in the number of agents. This article introduces collaborative
graphical Bayesian games (CGBGs), which facilitate more efficient collaborative
decision making by decomposing the global payoff function as the sum of local
payoff functions that depend on only a few agents. We propose a framework for
the efficient solution of CGBGs based on the insight that they posses two
different types of independence, which we call agent independence and type
independence. In particular, we present a factor graph representation that
captures both forms of independence and thus enables efficient solutions. In
addition, we show how this representation can provide leverage in sequential
tasks by using it to construct a novel method for decentralized partially
observable Markov decision processes. Experimental results in both random and

Taurus molecular cloud: one in the dense core L1495/B213 filament, the other in
a diffuse region to the west. The field is measured from the polarization of
background starlight seen through the cloud. In total, we measured 287
high-quality near-infrared polarization vectors in these regions. In
L1495/B213, the percent polarization increases with column density up to Av ~ 9
mag, the limits of our data. The Radiative Torques model for grain alignment
can explain this behavior, but models that invoke turbulence are inconsistent
with the data. We also combine our data with published optical and
near-infrared polarization measurements in Taurus. Using this large sample, we
estimate the strength of the plane-of-sky component of the magnetic field in
nine subregions. This estimation is done with two different techniques that use
the observed dispersion in polarization angles. Our values range from 5-82
microgauss and tend to be higher in denser regions. In all subregions, the
critical index of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio is sub-unity, implying that
Taurus is magnetically supported on large scales (~2 pc). Within the region
observed, the B213 filament makes a sharp turn to the north and the direction
of the magnetic field also takes a sharp turn, switching from being
perpendicular to the filament to becoming parallel. This behavior can be
understood if we are observing the rim of a bubble. We argue that it has
resulted from a supernova remnant associated with a recently discovered nearby
gamma-ray pulsar.

certain quasars, known as FeLoBALs, has recently revealed the number density of
the wind absorbers and their distance from the central supermassive black hole.
From these, the feedback efficiency of the quasars can in principle be derived.
The implied properties of the FeLoBALs are, however, surprising, with the
thickness of the absorbers relative to their distance from the black hole,
Delta R/R, as small as ~10^-5. Such absorbers are unlikely to survive the
journey from the supermassive black hole to their inferred location. We show
that the observed FeLoBAL properties are readily explained if they are formed
in situ in radiative shocks produced when a quasar blast wave impacts a
moderately dense interstellar clump along the line of sight. This physical
picture differs significantly from the thin shell approximation often assumed,
and implies outflow rates, kinetic luminosities and momentum fluxes that differ
correspondingly, in some cases at the order of magnitude level. Using the
radiative shock model, we estimate the ratio of the outflow kinetic luminosity
to bolometric luminosity for three bright FeLoBAL quasars in the literature. We
find Edot/Lbol~2-5% (and corresponding momentum fluxes Pdot~2-15 Lbol/c),
similar to what is adopted in models reproducing the M-sigma relation. These
outflow properties are also comparable to those recently inferred for molecular
outflows in local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, suggesting that active
galactic nuclei are capable of driving such outflows.

undertaken with the VLA. The sample was chosen to explore the role of rotation
in the radio activity of ultracool dwarfs. Combining the new sample with
results from our previous studies and from the literature, we compile the
largest sample to date of ultracool dwarfs with radio observations and measured
rotation velocities (167 objects). In the spectral type range M0-M6 we find a
radio activity-rotation relation, with saturation at log(L_rad/L_bol) 10^(-7.5)
above vsini~5 km/s, similar to the relation in H-alpha and X-rays. However, at
spectral types >M7 the ratio of radio to bolometric luminosity increases
regardless of rotation velocity, and the scatter in radio luminosity increases.
In particular, while the most rapid rotators (vsini>20 km/s) exhibit
""super-saturation"" in X-rays and H-alpha, this effect is not seen in the radio.
We also find that ultracool dwarfs with vsini>20 km/s have a higher radio
detection fraction by about a factor of 3 compared to objects with vsini<10
km/s. When measured in terms of the Rossby number (Ro), the radio
activity-rotation relation follows a single trend and with no apparent
saturation from G to L dwarfs and down to Ro~10^-3; in X-rays and H-alpha there
is clear saturation at Ro<0.1, with super-saturation beyond M7. A similar trend
is observed for the radio surface flux (L_rad/R^2) as a function of Ro. The
continued role of rotation in the overall level of radio activity and in the
fraction of active sources, and the single trend of L_rad/L_bol and L_rad/R^2
as a function of Ro from G to L dwarfs indicates that rotation effects are
important in regulating the topology or strength of magnetic fields in at least
some fully-convective dwarfs. The fact that not all rapid rotators are detected
in the radio provides additional support to the idea of dual dynamo states.

gas, and metal content of galaxies. It is based on the idea, inspired by
hydrodynamic simulations, that galaxies live in a slowly-evolving equilibrium
between inflow, outflow, and star formation. We argue that this formalism
broadly captures the behavior of galaxy properties evolving in simulations. The
resulting equilibrium equations for the star formation rate, gas fraction, and
metallicity depend on three key free parameters that represent ejective
feedback, preventive feedback, and re-accretion of ejected material. We
schematically describe how these parameters are constrained by models and
observations. Galaxies perturbed off the equilibrium relations owing to inflow
stochasticity tend to be driven back towards equilibrium, such that deviations
in star formation rate at a given mass are correlated with gas fraction and
anti-correlated with metallicity. After an early gas accumulation epoch,
quiescently star-forming galaxies are expected to be in equilibrium over most
of cosmic time. The equilibrium model provides a simple intuitive framework for
understanding the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties, and centrally features
the cycle of baryons between galaxies and surrounding gas as the driver of
galaxy growth.

specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the
Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment.
The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles
that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the
principles, (4) the linkages between the objectives, principles and practices,

Several different factors affect spectral features including sample chemistry

different sample preparation techniques lead to variations in porosity, density
and water content. The convolution of chemical and physical effects makes it
difficult to attribute changes in spectral parameters to any given variable. It
is important that detailed chemical and structural characterization be provided
along with laboratory spectra. In addition to composition and density, we
measured the glass transition temperatures for the samples which place upper
limits on the formation/processing temperatures of these solids in space.
Popular synthetically-generated optical functions do not have spectral features
that match any of our glass samples. However, the ~10 microns feature generated

Gaussian random field with a Kolmogorov-like energy spectrum. Both the power of
the jets and the viewing angle that is used for the synthetic Rotation Measure
(RM) observations are investigated. We find the model radio sources introduce
and amplify fluctuations on the RM statistical properties which we analyse as a
function of time as well as the viewing angle. The average RM and the RM
standard deviation are increased by the action of the jets. Energetics, RM
statistics and magnetic power spectral analysis consistently show that the
effects also correlate with the jets' power, and that the lightest, fastest
jets produce the strongest changes in their environment. We see jets distort
and amplify the CMFs especially near the edges of the lobes and the jets'
heads. This process leads to a flattening of the RM structure functions at
scales comparable to the source size. The edge features we find are similar to
ones observed in Hydra A. The results show that jet-produced RM enhancements
are more apparent in quasars than in radio galaxies. Globally, jets tend to
enhance the RM standard deviation which may lead to overestimations of the
CMFs' strength by about 70%. This study means to serve as a pathfinder for the

with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.6 GHz in two epochs: during the
January/February 2011 X-ray outburst and 30 days later. Results. The VLBI image
obtained during the outburst shows a compact ~0.4 mJy radio source, whereas 30
days later the source has faded and appears extended, with a projected size of
~75 AU. The peak of the emission is displaced between runs 21+/-5 AU, which is
bigger than the orbit size. The position of the radio source is compatible with
the Be star MWC 148, which sets the proper motion of the binary system below 3

models in which the elementary particles carry more than one kind of charge
with running coupling constants, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, having different
energy dependence and belonging to different gauge groups. Let these coupling
constants be normalized to agree with experiment at hadronic energies and
written as $\alpha_1 = \frac{e}{\sqrt{\hbar c}}$ and $\alpha_2 =

-1$. If this condition is maintained, then $eg = \hbar c$. If the elementary
particle is like a Schwinger dyon and therefore the source of magnetic as well

in the gas phase, with a significant fraction as O2. For this small source, the
line ratios require a temperature \geq 180 K. The inferred O2 column density

diffusion in temporal dimension, that is, how the information propagates over
time. Little attempt has been given on understanding information diffusion over
both temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we propose a Partial

to model the temporal and spatial characteristics of information diffusion in
online social networks. To be more specific, we develop a PDE-based theoretical
framework to measure and predict the density of influenced users at a given

of influenced users over time and distance provides valuable insight on the
actual information diffusion process. We present the temporal and spatial
patterns in a real dataset collected from Digg social news site, and validate
the proposed DL equation in terms of predicting the information diffusion
process. Our experiment results show that the DL model is indeed able to
characterize and predict the process of information propagation in online
social networks. For example, for the most popular news with 24,099 votes in
Digg, the average prediction accuracy of DL model over all distances during the

methodology. Predictive process approximation provides an effective solution to
the cubic order computational complexity of Gaussian process models. This
approximation crucially depends on a set of points, called knots, at which the
original process is retained, while the rest is approximated via a
deterministic extrapolation. Knots should be few in number to keep the
computational complexity low, but provide a good coverage of the process domain
to limit approximation error. We present theoretical calculations to show that
coverage must be judged by the canonical metric of the Gaussian process. This
necessitates having in place a knots selection algorithm that automatically
adapts to the changes in the canonical metric affected by changes in the
parameter values controlling the Gaussian process covariance function. We
present an algorithm toward this by employing an incomplete Cholesky
factorization with pivoting and dynamic stopping. Although these concepts
already exist in the literature, our contribution lies in unifying them into a
fast algorithm and in using computable error bounds to finesse implementation
of the predictive process approximation. The resulting adaptive predictive
process offers a substantial automatization of Guassian process model fitting,

recently shown an interesting connection between the gravitational Lagrangian
and black hole thermodynamics. A study of the actual spacetime was not the main
focus of this work and in particular, the rich and interesting structure of the
interior has not been investigated in much detail and remains largely unknown.
We elucidate its features by performing a numerical study of the spacetime in
isotropic coordinates during gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field.
The most salient feature to emerge is the formation of a thin shell of matter
just inside the apparent horizon. The energy density and Ricci scalar peak at
the shell and there is a jump discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature across
the apparent horizon, the hallmark that a thin shell is present in its
vicinity. At late stages of the collapse, the spacetime consists of two vacuum
regions separated by the thin shell. The interior is described by an
interesting collapsing isotropic universe. It tends towards a vacuum (never
reaches a perfect vacuum) and there is a slight inhomogeneity in the interior
that plays a crucial role in the collapse process as the areal radius tends to
zero. The spacetime evolves towards a curvature (physical) singularity in the
interior, both a Weyl and Ricci singularity. In the exterior, our numerical
results match closely the analytical form of the Schwarzschild metric in
isotropic coordinates, providing a strong test of our numerical code.

Reo's development tools. In this paper, we address one of these questions: we
investigate the equivalence between coloring models and constraint automata,
the two most dominant and practically relevant semantic models of Reo. More
specifically, we define operators that transform one model to the other (and
vice versa), prove their correctness, and show that they distribute over
composition. To ensure that the transformation operators map one-to-one
(instead of many-to-one), we extend coloring models with data constraints.
Though primarily a theoretical contribution, we sketch some potential
applications of our results: the broadening of the applicability of existing
tools for connector verification and animation.

we enriched a notation based on concepts from programming languages, especially
partial evaluation, for specifying a variety of unsolicited reporting,

specification in this notation from requirements. To demonstrate that such a

that automatically generates an implementation of the dialog, called a stager,
from it. These two components constitute a dialog modeling toolkit that
automates dialog specification and implementation. These results provide a

clinical trials and observational studies. It can be used to increase
efficiency and thus power, and to reduce possible bias. While most statistical
tests in randomized clinical trials are nonparametric in nature, approaches for
covariate adjustment typically rely on specific regression models, such as the
linear model for a continuous outcome, the logistic regression model for a
dichotomous outcome and the Cox model for survival time. Several recent efforts
have focused on model-free covariate adjustment. This paper makes use of the
empirical likelihood method and proposes a nonparametric approach to covariate
adjustment. A major advantage of the new approach is that it automatically
utilizes covariate information in an optimal way without fitting nonparametric
regression. The usual asymptotic properties, including the Wilks-type result of
convergence to a chi-square distribution for the empirical likelihood ratio
based test, and asymptotic normality for the corresponding maximum empirical
likelihood estimator, are established. It is also shown that the resulting test
is asymptotically most powerful and that the estimator for the treatment effect
achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. The new method is applied to the
Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO)-I trial.
Extensive simulations are conducted, validating the theoretical findings.

emissions in Martian dayglow has been developed to explain the recent
observations made by the Spectroscopy for Investigation of Characteristics of
the Atmosphere of Mars (SPICAM) ultraviolet spectrograph aboard Mars Express.
Steady state photoelectron fluxes and volume excitation rates have been
calculated using the analytical yield spectra technique. Since interstate
cascading is important for triplet states of N2, the population of any given
level of N2 triplet states is calculated under statistical equilibrium
considering direct excitation, cascading, and quenching effects. Relative
population of all vibrational levels of each triplet state is calculated in the
model. Line of sight intensities and height-integrated overhead intensities
have been calculated for VK, first positive (B^3Pi_g - A^3Sigma_u^+), second
positive (C^3Pi_u - B^3Pi_g), and Wu-Benesch (W^3Delta_u - B^3Pi_g) bands of
N2. A reduction in the N2 density by a factor of 3 in the Mars thermospheric
general circulation model is required to obtain agreement between calculated
limb profiles of VK (0-6) and SPICAM observation. Calculations are carried out
to asses the impact of model parameters, namely, electron impact cross
sections, solar EUV flux, and model atmosphere, on the emission intensities.
Constraining the N2/CO2 ratio by SPICAM observations, we suggest the N2/CO2
ratios to be in the range 1.1-1.4% at 120 km, 1.8-3.2% at 140 km, and 4-7% at
170 km. During high solar activity the overhead intensity of N2 VK band
emissions would be ~2.5 times higher than that during low solar activity.

angle a and range r. The coverage area of the antenna at point p is a circular
sector of angle a and radius r, whose orientation is adjustable. For a given
orientation assignment, the induced symmetric communication graph (SCG) of P is
the undirected graph that contains the edge (u,v) iff v lies in u's sector and
vice versa. In this paper we ask what is the smallest angle a for which there
exists an integer n=n(a), such that for any set P of n antennas of angle a and
unbounded range, one can orient the antennas so that the induced SCG is
connected, and the union of the corresponding wedges is the entire plane. We
show that the answer to this problem is a=\pi/2, for which n=4. Moreover, we
prove that if Q_1 and Q_2 are quadruplets of antennas of angle \pi/2 and
unbounded range, separated by a line, to which one applies the above
construction, independently, then the induced SCG of Q_1 \cup Q_2 is connected.
This latter result enables us to apply the construction locally, and to solve
the following two further problems.
  In the first problem, we are given a connected unit disk graph (UDG),
corresponding to a set P of omni-directional antennas of range 1, and the goal
is to replace these antennas by directional antennas of angle \pi/2 and range
r=O(1) and to orient them, such that the induced SCG is connected, and,
moreover, is an O(1)-spanner of the UDG, w.r.t. hop distance. In our solution r
= 14\sqrt{2} and the spanning ratio is 8. In the second problem, we are given a
set P of directional antennas of angle \pi/2 and adjustable range. The goal is
to assign to each antenna p, an orientation and a range r_p, such that the
resulting SCG is connected, and \sum_{p \in P} r_p^\beta is minimized, where
\beta \ge 1 is a constant. We present an O(1)-approximation algorithm.

belongs to the more general area of molecular computing. Membrane computing
aims at defining parallel and non-deterministic computing models, called
membrane systems or P Systems, which abstract from the functioning and
structure of the cell. A membrane system consists of a spatial structure, a
hierarchy of membranes which do not intersect, with a distinguishable membrane
called skin surrounding all of them. A membrane without any other membranes
inside is elementary, while a non-elementary membrane is a composite membrane.
The membranes define demarcations between regions; for each membrane there is a
unique associated region. Since we have a one-to-one correspondence, we
sometimes use membrane instead of region, and vice-versa. The space outside the
skin membrane is called the environment.
  In this thesis we define and investigate variants of systems of mobile
membranes as models for molecular computing and as modelling paradigms for
biological systems. On one hand, we follow the standard approach of research in
membrane computing: defining a notion of computation for systems of mobile
membranes, and investigating the computational power of such computing devices.
Specifically, we address issues concerning the power of operations for
modifying the membrane structure of a system of mobile membranes by mobility:
endocytosis (moving a membrane inside a neighbouring membrane) and endocytosis
(moving a membrane outside the membrane where it is placed). On the other hand,
we relate systems of mobile membranes to process algebra (mobile ambients,
timed mobile ambients, pi-calculus, brane calculus) by providing some encodings
and adding some concepts inspired from process algebra in the framework of
mobile membrane computing.

measurements from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO, for a sub sample of
199 objects). Our unprecedentedly large sample permits us to assess with high
accuracy the statistical significance of the correlation, using a
surrogate-data method designed to simultaneously account for common-distance
bias and the effect of a limited dynamical range in the observed quantities. We
find that the statistical significance of a positive correlation between the cm
radio and the broad band (E>100 MeV) gamma-ray energy flux is very high for the
whole AGN sample, with a probability <1e-7 for the correlation appearing by
chance. Using the OVRO data, we find that concurrent data improve the
significance of the correlation from 1.6e-6 to 9.0e-8. Our large sample size
allows us to study the dependence of correlation strength and significance on
specific source types and gamma-ray energy band. We find that the correlation
is very significant (chance probability <1e-7) for both FSRQs and BL Lacs

we combine these two methods with a study of the microlensing behaviour of the
BELR in Q2237+0305, as a change in continuum emission (a ""flare"") passes
through it. Beginning with some generic models of the BELR - sphere, bicones,
disk - we slice in velocity and time to produce brightness profiles of the BELR
over the duration of the flare. These are numerically microlensed to determine
whether microlensing of reverberation mapping provides new information about
the properties of BELRs. We describe our method and show images of the models
as they are flaring, and the unlensed and lensed spectra that are produced.
Qualitative results and a discussion of the spectra are given in this paper,
highlighting some effects that could be observed. Our conclusion is that the
influence of microlensing, while not strong, can produce significant observable
effects that will help in differentiating the properties of BELRs.

$^{54,55,56}$Fe, are advocated to play a key role inside the cores primarily
decreasing the electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) mainly via electron capture
processes thereby reducing the pressure support. Electron decay and positron
capture on $^{55}$Fe, on the other hand, also has a consequential role in
increasing the lepton ratio during the silicon burning phases of massive stars.
The neutrinos and antineutrinos produced, as a result of these weak-interaction
reactions, are transparent to the stellar matter and assist in cooling the core
thereby reducing the entropy. The structure of the presupernova star is altered
both by the changes in $Y_{e}$ and the entropy of the core material. The aim of
this paper is to report the improved microscopic calculation of Gamow-Teller
(GT$_{\pm}$) strength distributions of these key isotopes of iron using the
pn-QRPA theory. The main improvement comes from the incorporation of
experimental deformation values for these nuclei. Additionally six different
weak-interaction rates, namely electron & positron capture, electron & positron
decay, and, neutrino & antineutrino cooling rates, were also calculated in
presupernova matter. The calculated electron capture and neutrino cooling rates
due to isotopes of iron are in good agreement with the large-scale shell model
(LSSM) results. The calculated beta decay rates, however, are suppressed by
three to five orders of magnitude.

(ICMEs) in the ecliptic plane using data from STEREO/SECCHI at large
elongations from the Sun in combination with different geometric assumptions
about the ICME front shape (Fixed-\Phi (FP): a point and harmonic Mean (HM): a
circle). These forecasting techniques use single-spacecraft imaging data and
are based on the assumptions of constant velocity and direction. We show that
for the slow (350 km/s) ICME on 2009 February 13-18, observed at quadrature by
the two STEREO spacecraft, the results for the arrival time given by the HM
approximation are more accurate by 12 hours than those for FP in comparison to
in situ observations of solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters by
STEREO/IMPACT/PLASTIC, and by 6 hours for the arrival time at Venus Express
(MAG). We propose that the improvement is directly related to the ICME front
shape being more accurately described by HM for an ICME with a low inclination
of its symmetry axis to the ecliptic. In this case the ICME has to be tracked
to > 30{\deg} elongation to get arrival time errors < 5 hours. A newly derived
formula for calculating arrival times with the HM method is also useful for a
triangulation technique assuming the same geometry.

description. The mechanism of relaxation is assumed to be due to dipole-dipole
interaction of nuclear spins and is treated within the framework of the
standard Bloemberger, Purcell, Pound - Solomon scheme. We consider the general
case of arbitrary orientation of the cone axis relative the magnetic field. The
BPP-Solomon scheme is shown to remain valid for systems with the distribution
of the cone axes depending only on the tilt relative the magnetic field but
otherwise being isotropic. We consider the case of random isotropic orientation
of cone axes relative the magnetic field taking place in powders. Also we
consider the cases of their predominant orientation along or opposite the
magnetic field and that of their predominant orientation transverse to the
magnetic field which may be relevant for, e.g., liquid crystals. Besides we
treat in details the model case of the cone axis directed along the magnetic
field. The latter provides direct comparison of the limiting case of our
formulas with the textbook formulas for free isotropic rotational diffusion.
The dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate on the cone half-width

Voltage modulated light emission tracks the onset of observed negative
capacitance at a forward bias level for each modulation frequency. Active
participation of sub-bandgap defect states in minority carrier recombination
dynamics is sought to explain the results. Negative capacitance is understood
as a necessary dielectric response to compensate any irreversible transient
changes in the minority carrier reservoir due to radiative recombinations
mediated by slowly responding sub-bandgap defects. Experimentally measured
variations of the in-phase component of modulated electroluminescence spectra
with forward bias levels and modulation frequencies support the dynamic
influence of these states in the radiative recombination process. Predominant
negative sign of the in-phase component of voltage modulated
electroluminescence signal further confirms the bi-molecular nature of light
emission. We also discuss how these states can actually affect the net density
of minority carriers available for radiative recombination. Results indicate
that these sub-bandgap states can suppress external quantum efficiency of such

uniformly approach capacity over the class of binary-input memoryless

resultant tubulin configuration changes. The GTP cap model has been proposed to
interpret the stabilizing mechanism of microtubule growth from the view of
hydrolysis effects. Besides, the microtubule growth involves the closure of a
curved sheet at its growing end. The curvature conversion also helps to
stabilize the successive growth, and the curved sheet is referred to as the
conformational cap. However, there still lacks theoretical investigation on the
mechanical-chemical coupling growth process of microtubules. In this paper, we
study the growth mechanisms of microtubules by using a coarse-grained molecular
method. Firstly, the closure process involving a sheet-to-tube transition is
simulated. The results verify the stabilizing effect of the sheet structure,
and the minimum conformational cap length that can stabilize the growth is
demonstrated to be two dimers. Then, we show that the conformational cap can
function independently of the GTP cap, signifying the pivotal role of
mechanical factors. Furthermore, based on our theoretical results, we describe
a Tetris-like growth style of microtubules: the stochastic tubulin assembly is
regulated by energy and harmonized with the seam zipping such that the sheet
keeps a practically constant length during growth.

classified following the ABC classification that has been proposed before. Our
results show that the ABC classification can be extended to include spectral
dependencies and that the three QPO types have indeed intrinsically different
properties. In terms of the relation between QPO frequency and power-law flux,
type-A and -C QPOs may follow the same relation, whereas the type-B QPOs trace
out a very different relation. Type-B QPO frequencies clearly correlate with
the powerlaw-flux and are connected to local increases of the count rate. The
frequency of all QPOs observed in the rising phase of the 2002, 2007 and 2010
outburst correlate with the disk flux. Our results can be interpreted within
the framework of recently proposed QPO models involving Lense-Thirring
precession. We suggest that type- C and -A QPOs might be connected and could be

different level of energy shifts, boosting, and amplification by relativistic
effects. These have to be convolved with the intrinsic emissivity of the line,
which is a function of radius and the emission angle in the local frame. We
study if the currently discussed instruments on-board X-ray satellites will be
able to reveal the departure of the line radial emissivity from a simple smooth
power-law function, which is often assumed in data fitting and interpretation.
Such a departure can be a result of excess emission occurring at a certain

the classical FR II models, we assume that the lobe is dominated by the
particles injected from the central jet. The entrainment produces a boundary
shear layer which acts at the interface between the dense central jet and the
less denser surrounding lobe, and the associated erosion of the jet places
interesting limits on the maximum size of FR II sources. The model shows that
this limit depends mainly on the initial bulk velocity of the relativistic jet
triggered. The bulk velocities of FR IIs suggested by our model are in good
agreement with that obtained from direct pc-scale observations on ordinary

find that increasing the binding energy $\epsilon$ between the chaperone and
the chain and the chaperone concentration $N_c$ can greatly improve the
translocation probability. Particularly, with increasing the chaperone
concentration a maximum translocation probability is observed for weak binding.
For a fixed chaperone concentration, the histogram of translocation time $\tau$
has a transition from long-tailed distribution to Gaussian distribution with
increasing $\epsilon$. $\tau$ rapidly decreases and then almost saturates with
increasing binding energy for short chain, however, it has a minimum for longer
chains at lower chaperone concentration. We also show that $\tau$ has a minimum
as a function of the chaperone concentration. For different $\epsilon$, a
nonuniversal dependence of $\tau$ on the chain length $N$ is also observed.
These results can be interpreted by characteristic entropic effects for
flexible polymers induced by either crowding effect from high chaperone
concentration or the intersegmental binding for the high binding energy.

structure in the excursion set approach, accounting for correlations between
steps of the random walks in the smoothed initial density field. These
correlations are induced by realistic smoothing filters (as opposed to a filter
that is sharp in k-space), but have been ignored by many analyses to date. We
present analytical arguments -- building on existing results for Gaussian
initial conditions -- which suggest that the effect of the filter at large
smoothing scales is remarkably simple, and is in fact identical to what happens
in the Gaussian case: the non-Gaussian walks behave as if they were smooth and
deterministic, or ""completely correlated"". As a result, the first crossing
distribution (which determines, e.g., halo abundances) follows from the
single-scale statistics of the non-Gaussian density field -- the so-called
""cloud-in-cloud"" problem does not exist for completely correlated walks. Also,
the answer from single-scale statistics is simply one half that for sharp-k
walks. We explicitly test these arguments using Monte Carlo simulations of
non-Gaussian walks, showing that the resulting first crossing distributions,
and in particular the factor 1/2 argument, are remarkably insensitive to
variations in the power spectrum and the defining non-Gaussian process. We also
use our Monte Carlo walks to test some of the existing prescriptions for the
non-Gaussian first crossing distribution. Since the factor 1/2 holds for both
Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions, it provides a theoretical
motivation (the first, to our knowledge) for the common practice of
analytically prescribing a ratio of non-Gaussian to Gaussian halo abundances.

develop a turbulent environment. In this scenario the post shocked regions are
able to produced both H$_2$ and HD molecules very efficiently reaching maximum
abundances of $n_\mathrm{H_2}\sim10^{-2}n_\mathrm{H}$ and $n_\mathrm{HD}\sim
\mathrm{few}\times10^{-6}n_\mathrm{H}$, enough to cool the gas below 100K in
some regions. The kinetic energy spectrum of the turbulent primordial gas is
close to a Burgers spectrum, $\hat{E}_k\propto k^{-2}$, which could favor the
formation of low mass primordial stars. The solenoidal to total kinetic energy
ratio is $0.65\la R_k\la0.7$ for a wide range of wave numbers; this value is
close to $R_k\approx 2/3$ natural equipartition energy value of a random
turbulent flow. In this way turbulence and molecular cooling seem to work
together in order to produce potential star formation regions of cold and dense
gas in primordial environments. We conclude that both the mergers and the
collapse process onto the main DM halo provide enough energy to develop super
sonic turbulence which favor the molecular coolants formation: this mechanism,
which could be universal and the main route toward formation of the first
galaxies, is able to create potential star forming regions at high redshift.

damage rf accelerators, tokamaks and other high gradient structures. We
simulate the dense, non-ideal plasma sheath near a metallic surface using
Molecular Dynamics (MD) to evaluate sheaths in the non-Debye region for high
density, low temperature plasmas. We use direct two-component MD simulations
where the interactions between all electrons and ions are computed explicitly.
We find that the non-Debye sheath can be extrapolated from the Debye sheath
parameters with small corrections. We find that these parameters are roughly
consistent with previous PIC code estimates, pointing to densities in the range
$10^{24} - 10^{25}\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The high surface fields implied by these
results could produce field emission that would short the sheath and cause an
instability in the time evolution of the arc, and this mechanism could limit
the maximum density and surface field in the arc. These results also provide a
way of understanding how the ""burn voltage"" of an arc is generated, and the
relation between self sputtering and the burn voltage, while not well
understood, seems to be closely correlated. Using these results, and equating
surface tension and plasma pressure, it is possible to infer a range of plasma
densities and sheath potentials from SEM images of arc damage. We find that the
high density plasma these results imply and the level of plasma pressure they
would produce is consistent with arc damage on a scale 100 nm or less, in
examples where the liquid metal would cool before this structure would be lost.
We find that the sub-micron component of arc damage, the burn voltage, and
fluctuations in the visible light production of arcs may be the most direct
indicators of the parameters of the dense plasma arc, and the most useful
diagnostics of the mechanisms limiting gradients in accelerators.

shown to significantly improve estimates based on only a few sampling probes,

strength, length scale, and precise functional form of the exploited
autocorrelation function of the matrix diagonal is determined from the probes

cutting and depinning. The intriguing occurrence of negative current patterns
and the enhancement of the transport current flow along the center of the
superconducting sample are reproduced as a straightforward consequence of the
magnetically induced internal anisotropy. Moreover, we show that related to a
maximal projection of the current density vector onto the local magnetic field,
a maximal transport current density occurs somewhere within the sample. The
elusive measurement of the flux cutting threshold (critical value of such
parallel component $J_{c ||}$) is suggested on the basis of local measurements
of the transport current density. Finally, we show that a high correlation

confined by the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits located at
the ends of the bar. We discuss whether the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar
compose a single bar or two independent bars and perform a number of
comparisons which, taken together, argue strongly in favour of the former. More
specifically, we favour the possibility that the so-called COBE/DIRBE bar is
the boxy/peanut bulge of a bar whose outer thin parts are the so-called Long
bar. This possibility is in good agreement both with observations of external
galaxies, with orbital structure theory and with simulations. We then analyse
in detail the morphology and kinematics given by five representative Galactic
potentials. Two have a Ferrers bar, two have a quadrupole bar and the last one
a composite bar. We first consider only the COBE/DIRBE bar and then extend it
to include the effect of the Long bar. We find that the large-scale structure
given by the manifolds describes an inner ring, whose size is similar to the
near and far 3-kpc arm, and an outer ring, whose properties resemble those of
the Galactic Molecular Ring. We also analyse the kinematics of these two
structures, under the different galactic potentials, and find they reproduce
the main over-densities found in the galactic longitude-velocity CO diagram.
Finally, we consider for what model parameters, the global morphology of the

n-interval groupoids, n-interval semigroups, n-interval loops and so on are
introduced and analysed. Using these notions n-interval mixed algebraic
structure are defined and described. Some probable applications are discussed.
Only in due course of time several applications would be evolved by researchers
as per their need. The final chapter suggests around 295 problems of which some
are simple exercises, some are difficult and some of them are research
problems.
