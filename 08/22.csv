symmetry group can possess structurally stable heteroclinic cycles. In this
paper we study stability properties of a class of structurally stable
heteroclinic cycles in R^n which we call heteroclinic cycles of type Z. It is
well-known that a heteroclinic cycle that is not asymptotically stable can
attract nevertheless a positive measure set from its neighbourhood. We say that
an invariant set X is fragmentarily asymptotically stable, if for any delta>0
the measure of its local basin of attraction B_delta(X) is positive. A local
basin of attraction B_delta(X) is the set of such points that trajectories
starting there remain in the delta-neighbourhood of X for all t>0, and are
attracted by X as t\to\infty. Necessary and sufficient conditions for
fragmentary asymptotic stability are expressed in terms of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of transition matrices. If all transverse eigenvalues of
linearisations near steady states involved in the cycle are negative, then
fragmentary asymptotic stability implies asymptotic stability. In the latter
case the condition for asymptotic stability is that the transition matrices
have an eigenvalue larger than one in absolute value. Finally, we discuss
bifurcations occurring when the conditions for asymptotic stability or for
fragmentary asymptotic stability are broken.

$S$ have been defined, for example [3], [4] and [8]. The homology curve complex
$\mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha)$ defined in [7] is one such complex, with vertices
corresponding to multicurves in a nontrivial integral homology class $\alpha$.
Given two multicurves $m_1$ and $m_2$ corresponding to vertices in
$\mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha)$, it was shown in [8] that a path in
$\mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha)$ connecting these vertices represents a surface in
$S\times \mathbb{R}$, and a simple algorithm for constructing minimal genus
surfaces of this type was obtained. In this paper, a Morse theoretic argument
will be used to prove that all embedded orientable incompressible surfaces in
$S\times \mathbb{R}$ with boundary curves homotopic to $m_{2}-m_1$ are
homotopic to a surface constructed in this way. This is used to relate distance
between two vertices in $\mathcal{HC}(S,\alpha)$ to the Seifert genus of the
corresponding link in $S\times \mathbb{R}$.

rotation of the trap containing a spin-orbit condensate does not lead to an
equilibrium state with static vortex structures, but gives rise instead to
non-equilibrium behavior described by an intrinsically time-dependent
Hamiltonian. We propose here the following alternative methods to induce
thermodynamically stable static vortex configurations: (1) to rotate both the
lasers and the anisotropic trap; and (2) to impose a synthetic Abelian field on
top of synthetic spin-orbit interactions. Effective Hamiltonians for spin-orbit
condensates under such perturbations are derived for most currently known
realistic laser schemes that induce synthetic spin-orbit couplings. The
Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved for several experimentally relevant
regimes. The new interesting effects include spatial separation of left- and
right-moving spin-orbit condensates, the appearance of unusual vortex
arrangements, and parity effects in vortex nucleation where the topological
excitations are predicted to appear in pairs. All these phenomena are shown to
be highly non-universal and depend strongly on a specific laser scheme and

the computation of the accuracy in 2D and 3D are often simplified by an

accuracy results that are too conservative (up to 25% in the 2D case and up to
43% in the 3D case, for a 95% confidence level), which in turn translates into
pessimistic System Availability. This article presents a way to compute the

introduced here, allows getting accurate results swiftly.
  The generic mathematical solution to compute the accuracy is presented. The

detecting solar and core collapsing supernovae (SNe) neutrinos and the Gamow
Teller strength are calculated by considering the high-lying excited states up
to a few tens of MeV region. The nucleus was originally exploited to identify
the solar neutrino emitted from $^{8}$B produced in the pp-chains on the Sun.
With the higher energy neutrinos emitted from the core collapsing SNe,
contributions from higher multi-pole transitions including the spin dipole
resonances (SDR) as well as the Gamow Teller (GT) and Fermi transitions are
shown to be important ingredients for understanding reactions induced by the
SNe as well as solar neutrinos. In this work, we focused on the role of
high-lying excited states which are located beyond a few low-lying states known
in the experiment. Expected large difference between the cross sections of
$\nu_e$ and ${\bar \nu_e}$ reactions on $^{40}$Ar, which difference has been
anticipated in previous calculations because of the large Q value in the ${\bar
\nu}_e$ reaction, is significantly diminished. The reduction leads only to
about 2 times difference between them. Our calculations are carried out by the
Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA), which takes account of the
neutron-proton pairing as well as proton-proton and neutron-neutron pairing
correlations. They were successfully applied in the description of the nuclear
beta decay and relevant neutrino reaction data on $^{12}$C and $^{56}$Fe, and
the GT data on the $^{138}$La and $^{180}$Ta.

current is converted into an electric voltage due to the inverse spin-Hall

types of galaxies observed today. Multi-zoom cosmological simulations are used
to estimate as a function of time the evolution of mass in bound systems, for
dark matter as well as baryons. The baryonic contents of dark matter haloes are
studied. Merger histories are followed as a function of external density, and
the different ways in which mass is assembled in galaxies and the stellar
component accumulated are quantified. We find that most galaxies assemble their
mass through smooth accretion, and only the most massive galaxies also grow
significantly through mergers. The mean fraction of mass assembled by accretion
is 77 %, and by mergers 23 %. We present typical accretion histories of
hundreds of galaxies: masses of the most massive galaxies increase
monotonically in time, mainly through accretion, many intermediate-mass objects
also experience mass-loss events such as tidal stripping and evaporation.
However, our simulations suffer from the overcooling of massive galaxies caused
by the neglect of active galaxy nuclei (AGN) feedback. The time by which half
of the galay mass has assembled, both in dark matter and baryons, is a
decreasing function of mass, which is compatible with the observations of a
so-called downsizing. At every epoch in the universe, there are low-mass
galaxies actively forming stars, while more massive galaxies form their stars
over a shorter period of time within half the age of the universe.

and comparing lower bounds on $C$ and upper bounds on $C_{\text{SS}}$, various

also demonstrated that $C_{\text{SS}}$ is strictly less than $C$ for a broad
class of LOCs. In general, an optimal subspace coding scheme is difficult to
find because it requires to solve the maximization of a non-concave function.
However, for a LOC with a unique subspace degradation, $C_{\text{SS}}$ can be
obtained by solving a convex optimization problem over rank distribution.
Classes of LOCs with a unique subspace degradation are characterized. Since
LOCs with uniform-given-rank transfer matrices have unique subspace
degradations, some existing results on LOCs with uniform-given-rank transfer

of dominance of nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances. Experimental data for these
reactions have recently been reported by the HADES Collaboration. In the
original model, the dileptons are produced either from the decays of nucleon
and $\Delta$ resonances $R \rightarrow N e^+ e^-$ or from the Dalitz decays of
$\pi^0$- and $\eta$-mesons created in the $R \to N\pi^0$ and $R \to N\eta$
decays. We found that the distribution of dilepton invariant masses in the $pp
\rightarrow e^+ e^- X$ reaction is well reproduced by the contributions of $R
\rightarrow N e^+ e^-$ decays and $R \rightarrow N \pi^0$, $\pi^0 \to \gamma
e^+e^-$ decays. Among the resonances, the predominant contribution comes from
the $\Delta(1232)$, which determines both the direct decay channel $R
\rightarrow N e^+ e^-$ and the pion decay channel. In the collisions $np
\rightarrow e^+ e^- X$, additional significant contributions arise from the
$\eta$-meson Dalitz decays, produced in the $np \rightarrow np\eta$ and $np
\rightarrow d\eta$ reactions, the radiative capture $np \rightarrow d e^+ e^-$,
and the $np \rightarrow np e^+ e^-$ bremsstrahlung. These mechanisms may partly
explain the strong excess of dileptons in the cross section for collisions of
$np$ versus $pp$, which ranges from 7 to 100 times for the dilepton invariant
masses of 0.2 to 0.5 GeV.

broadband emission from radio to gamma rays. If the system comprises a massive
star and a young non-accreting pulsar, their winds will collide producing
broadband non-thermal emission, most likely originated in the shocked pulsar
wind. Thermal X-ray emission is expected from the shocked stellar wind, but
until now it has neither been detected nor studied in the context of gamma-ray
binaries. We present a semi-analytic model of the thermal X-ray emission from
the shocked stellar wind in pulsar gamma-ray binaries, and find that the
thermal X-ray emission increases monotonically with the pulsar spin-down
luminosity, reaching luminosities of the order of 10^33 erg/s. The lack of
thermal features in the X-ray spectrum of gamma-ray binaries can then be used
to constrain the properties of the pulsar and stellar winds. By fitting the
observed X-ray spectra of gamma-ray binaries with a source model composed of an
absorbed non-thermal power law and the computed thermal X-ray emission, we are
able to derive upper limits on the spin-down luminosity of the putative pulsar.
We applied this method to LS 5039, the only gamma-ray binary with a radial,
powerful wind, and obtain an upper limit on the pulsar spin-down luminosity of
~6x10^36 erg/s. Given the energetic constraints from its high-energy gamma-ray
emission, a non-thermal to spin-down luminosity ratio very close to unity may
be required.

detected within the sunspots, and track them through their evolution. We find
the total visible umbral area is 20-40% of the total visible sunspot area at
all stages of the solar cycle. We find that the number of sunspots observed
follows the Solar Influences Data Centre International Sunspot Number with some
interesting deviations. Finally, we use the magnetic information in our
catalogue to study the long term variation of magnetic field strength within
sunspot umbrae and find that it increases and decreases along with the sunspot
number. However, if we were to assume a secular decreaseas was reported in the
Kitt Peak data and take into account sunspots throughout the whole solar cycle

interactions has only been recently investigated. In this paper, a versatile
framework for cell motility is implemented in-silico in order to study the
minimal requirements for the coordination of a group of epithelial cells. We
find that cell motility and cell-cell mechanical interactions are sufficient to
generate a broad array of behaviours commonly observed in vitro and in vivo.
Cell streaming, sheet migration and susceptibility to leader cells are examples
of behaviours spontaneously emerging from these simple assumptions, which might
explain why collective effects are so ubiquitous in nature. This analysis
provides also new insights into cancer metastasis and cell sorting, suggesting
in particular that collective invasion might result from an emerging
coordination in a system where single cells are mechanically unable to invade.

Math. 274 (2015), 881-927",,,"math.CA math.GN math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new concept of dimension for metric spaces, the so-called
topological Hausdorff dimension. It is defined by a very natural combination of
the definitions of the topological dimension and the Hausdorff dimension. The
value of the topological Hausdorff dimension is always between the topological
dimension and the Hausdorff dimension, in particular, this new dimension is a
non-trivial lower estimate for the Hausdorff dimension.
  We examine the basic properties of this new notion of dimension, compare it
to other well-known notions, determine its value for some classical fractals
such as the Sierpinski carpet, the von Koch snowflake curve, Kakeya sets, the
trail of the Brownian motion, etc.
  As our first application, we generalize the celebrated result of Chayes,
Chayes and Durrett about the phase transition of the connectedness of the limit
set of Mandelbrot's fractal percolation process. They proved that certain
curves show up in the limit set when passing a critical probability, and we
prove that actually `thick' families of curves show up, where roughly speaking
the word thick means that the curves can be parametrized in a natural way by a
set of large Hausdorff dimension. The proof of this is basically a lower
estimate of the topological Hausdorff dimension of the limit set. For the sake
of completeness, we also give an upper estimate and conclude that in the
non-trivial cases the topological Hausdorff dimension is almost surely strictly

the prescriptions of Blumenthal et al. (1986) and Gnedin et al. (2004), and its
impact on rotation curves. Adiabatically contracted halos display a central
power index of ~0.7+/-0.1 for nearly all values of the Einasto shape parameter,
alpha, and are well fit inside ~>1 kpc by double power laws. However, attempts
to fit exponential disc and uncontracted halos to adiabatically contracted
rotation curves yield disc masses and central power indices that are too large.
We also determine whether or not the rotation curve of NGC 6503 displays
evidence of adiabatic contraction using previously published bar formation
constraints, and find that NGC 6503 most likely has a minimally contracted
halo. However, this conclusion depends on the correct choice of circular
velocity curve.

binary soft spheres. We found that even in the strongly sheared situation, the
supercooled liquid exhibits surprisingly isotropic responses to oscillating
shear strains applied in three different components of the strain tensor. Based
on this isotropic feature, we successfully constructed a simple two-mode
Maxwell model that can capture the key features of the storage and loss moduli,
even for highly non-equilibrium state. Furthermore, we examined the correlation
functions of the shear stress fluctuations, which also exhibit isotropic
relaxation behaviors in the sheared non-equilibrium situation. In contrast to
the isotropic features, the supercooled liquid additionally demonstrates
anisotropies in both its responses and its correlations to the shear stress
fluctuations. Using the constitutive equation (a two-mode Maxwell model), we
demonstrated that the anisotropic responses are caused by the coupling between
the oscillating strain and the driving shear flow. We measured the magnitude of
this violation in terms of the effective temperature. It was demonstrated that
the effective temperature is notably different between different components,
which indicates that a simple scalar mapping, such as the concept of an
effective temperature, oversimplifies the true nature of supercooled liquids
under shear flow. An understanding of the mechanism of isotropies and
anisotropies in the responses and fluctuations will lead to a better
appreciation of these violations of the FDT, as well as certain consequent
modifications to the concept of an effective temperature.

within the binary system as a result of the interaction of the pulsar and

determine abundances of N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and Fe and study the properties of the
LBV from the fluxes and widths of broad emission lines. We derive an
interstellar oxygen abundance of 12+log O/H = 7.71+/-0.02, which is in
agreement with previous determinations. The observed fluxes of narrow Balmer,
Paschen and Brackett hydrogen lines correspond to the theoretical recombination
values after correction for extinction with a single value C(Hbeta) = 0.225.
This implies that the star-forming region observed in the optical range is the
only source of ionisation and there is no additional source of ionisation that
is seen in the NIR range but is hidden in the optical range. For the LBV star
in PHL 293B we find broad emission with P Cygni profiles in several Balmer
hydrogen emission lines and for the first time in several Paschen hydrogen
lines and in several HeI emission lines, implying temporal evolution of the LBV
on a time scale of 8 years. The Halpha luminosity of the LBV star is by one
order of magnitude higher than the one obtained for the LBV star in NGC
2363=Mrk 71 which has a slightly higher metallicity 12+logO/H = 7.87. The
terminal velocity of the stellar wind in the low-metallicity LBV of PHL293B is
high, ~800 km/s, and is comparable to that seen in spectra of some
extragalactic LBVs during outbursts. We find that the averaged terminal
velocities derived from the Paschen and HeI emission lines are by some ~40-60
km/s lower than those derived from the Balmer emission lines. This probably
indicates the presence of the wind accelerating outward.

the long stagnation periods cause time-averages to divert from the

the fraction of time spent by a particle in half box, and the time-average of
the particle's position in a harmonic field. In both cases, we obtain the
probability density function of the time-averages for $t \rightarrow \infty$

potential of 30 nearly face-on intermediate-to-late-type spirals from the

sigma(z,R=0), is related to the maximum rotation speed (Vmax) as sigma(z,R=0) ~
0.26 Vmax, consistent with previous measurements for edge-on disk galaxies and
a mean stellar velocity ellipsoid axial ratio sigma(z) / sigma(R) = 0.6. For
reasonable values of disk oblateness, this relation implies these galaxy disks
are submaximal. We find disks in our sample contribute only 15% to 30% of the
dynamical mass within 2.2 disk scale-lengths (hR), with percentages increasing
systematically with luminosity, rotation speed and redder color. These trends
indicate the mass ratio of disk-to-total matter remains at or below 50% at 2.2
hR even for the most extreme, fast-rotating disks (Vmax > 300 km/s), of the
reddest rest-frame, face-on color (B-K ~ 4 mag), and highest luminosity

results imply that the stellar mass-to-light ratio and hence the accounting of
baryons in stars should be lowered by at least a factor of 3.

evolving in a symmetric and spatially periodic potential. The latter is exerted
to a time-periodic modulation of its inclination. Our interest is twofold:
Firstly we deal with the issue of chaotic motion in the higher-dimensional
phase space. To this end a homoclinic Melnikov analysis is utilised assuring
the presence of transverse homoclinic orbits and homoclinic bifurcations for
weak coupling allowing also for the emergence of hyperchaos. In contrast, we
also prove that the time evolution of the two coupled particles attains a
completely synchronised (chaotic) state for strong enough coupling between
them. The resulting `freezing of dimensionality' rules out the occurrence of
hyperchaos. Secondly we address coherent collective particle transport provided
by regular periodic motion. A subharmonic Melnikov analysis is utilised to
investigate persistence of periodic orbits. For directed particle transport
mediated by rotating periodic motion we present exact results regarding the
collective character of the running solutions entailing the emergence of a
current. We show that coordinated energy exchange between the particles takes
place in such a manner that they are enabled to overcome - one particle
followed by the other - consecutive barriers of the periodic potential
resulting in collective directed motion.

paper proposes a GSM model - the Bessel K model - that induces concave penalty

used, the value of the noise variance, and whether real or complex signals are
estimated. Using the Bessel K model, we derive a sparse estimator based on a
modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm formulated for Type II

proposed by Tipping and Faul [1] and by Babacan et al. [2]. Numerical results
show the superiority of the proposed estimator over these state-of-the-art

resolution near infrared imaging data obtained with NAOS/CONICA at the ESO VLT
to measure the individual proper motions of stars in the Quintuplet cluster in
the cluster reference frame. An unbiased sample of cluster members within a
radius of 0.5 pc from the cluster centre was established based on their common
motion with respect to the field and a subsequent colour-cut. Initial stellar
masses were inferred from four isochrones covering ages from 3 to 5 Myr and two
sets of stellar evolution models. For each isochrone the present-day mass
function of stars was determined for the full sample of main sequence cluster

alpha = -1.66+-0.14 for an approximate mass range from 5 to 40M_Sun, which is
significantly flatter than the Salpeter slope of alpha = -2.35. The flattening
of the present-day mass function may be caused by rapid dynamical evolution of
the cluster in the strong Galactic centre tidal field. The derived mass
function slope is compared to the values found in other young massive clusters

function. The characteristic function of QNC in a composite system is defined
as a response function under the local quantum measurement. It is explored that
once a characteristic function is given, the state of a composite system, with
just a local trace-preserving quantum operation uncertainty, will be
determined. We show that the strength of QNC basing on the characteristic
function is a half-positive-definite function and does not change under any LU
operation. For a two-partite pure state, the strength of QNC is equivalent to
the quantum entanglement. Generally, we give a new definition for quantum
entanglement using the strength function. Furthermore, we also give a
separability-criterion for 2\timesm-dimensional mixed real matrix. This letter
proposes an alternate way for QNC further research.

relaxed by introducing a singlet which couples to the Higgs fields, even at a

moment. In the models of a singlet extension, it is known that the upper bound
is relaxed by a tree-level contribution, especially at small tan beta region.
For large tan beta, however, the requirement for the perturbativity on the
singlet-Higgs coupling up to the GUT scale prevents the lightest Higgs from
obtaining a large tree-level mass. We construct an explicit UV complete model
which allows large singlet-Higgs coupling at low energy without disturbing the
perturbativity. The UV completion can be applied for any singlet extension of
the MSSM. Moreover, we point out that the radiative correction from the
singlet-Higgs coupling becomes dominant, and the lightest Higgs mass can be
easily as heavy as 130 GeV if this coupling is large enough even for large tan
beta.

initially drive the rotation period and the orientation of the rotation axis
into an equilibrium state but do not necessarily lead to synchronous rotation.
As tides also circularize the orbit, eventually the rotation period does equal
the orbital period and one hemisphere will be permanently irradiated by the
star. Furthermore, the rotational axis will become perpendicular to the orbit,
i.e. the planetary surface will not experience seasonal variations of the
insolation. We illustrate here how tides alter the spins of planets in the
traditional habitable zone. As an example, we show that, neglecting
perturbations due to other companions, the Super-Earth Gl581d performs two
rotations per orbit and that any primordial obliquity has been eroded.

revisit the constraints on diffusion-model parameters set by the quartet (1H,
2H, 3He, 4He), using the most recent data as well as updated formulae for the
inelastic and production cross-sections. The analysis relies on the USINE
propagation package and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to estimate the
probability density functions of the parameters. Simulated data are also used
to validate analysis strategies. The fragmentation of CNO cosmic rays (resp.
NeMgSiFe) on the ISM during their propagation contributes to 20% (resp. 20%) of
the 2H and 15% (resp. 10%) of the 3He flux at high energy. The C to Fe elements
are also responsible for up to 10% of the 4He flux measured at 1 GeV/n. The
analysis of 3He/4He (and to a less extent 2H/4He) data shows that the transport
parameters are consistent with those from the B/C analysis: the diffusion model
with delta~0.7 (diffusion slope), Vc~20 km/s (galactic wind), Va~40 km/s
(reacceleration) is favoured, but the combination delta~0.2, Vc~0, and Va~80
km/s is a close second. The confidence intervals on the parameters show that
the constraints set by the quartet data are competitive with those brought by
the B/C data. These constraints are tighter when adding the 3He (or 2H) flux
measurements, and the tightest when further adding the He flux. For the latter,
the analysis of simulated and real data show an increased sensitivity to
biases. Using secondary-to-primary ratio along with a loose prior on the source
parameters is recommended to get the most robust constraints on the transport
parameters.

disintegration of projectile like fragment resulting from heavy ion collisions
at intermediate or higher energy. The model has three parts: (1) abrasion, (2)
disintegration of the hot abraded projectile like fragment (PLF) into nucleons
and primary composites using a model of equilibrium statistical mechanics and
(3) possible evaporation of hot primary composites. It was assumed that the PLF
resulting from abrasion has one temperature T. Data suggested that while just
one value of T seemed adequate for most cross-sections calculations, it failed
when dealing with very peripheral collisions. We have now introduced a variable
T=T(b) where b is the impact parameter of the collision. We argue there are
data which not only show that T must be a function of b but, in addition, also
point to an approximate value of T for a given b. We propose a very simple
formula: T(b)=D_0+D_1(A_s(b)/A_0) where A_s(b) is the mass of the abraded PLF
and A_0 is the mass of the projectile; D_0 and D_1 are constants. Using this

In contrast to previous 2D models, these 3D networks with binary cross-links
are under-constrained with respect to fiber stretching elasticity, suggesting
that bending may dominate their response. We find that such networks exhibit a
fiber length-controlled bending regime and a crossover to a stretch-dominated
regime for lengths beyond a characteristic scale that depends on the fiber's
elastic properties. Finally, by extending the model to the nonlinear regime, we
show that these networks become intrinsically nonlinear with a vanishing linear
response regime in the limit of floppy or long filaments.

  Explosions?","25 pages, 20 figures, 33 eps files; significant extension due to
  referee comments and more simulations; version accepted by ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/755/2/138",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Following a simulation approach of recent publications we explore the
viability of the neutrino-heating explosion mechanism in dependence on the
spatial dimension. Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also
observe that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino
luminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that
explosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that
the average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension
and thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,
mass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic
energy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.
Coherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing
accretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions
because they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.
While 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the
opposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the
turbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial
scales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D
is in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on
smaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more
similar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be
tightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including
nonaxisymmetric ones.

will begin to dominate its behavior. This entails the exciting possibility of
controlling the conductance of a device by direct manipulation of the electron
wave function. Such control has been most clearly demonstrated in mesoscopic
semiconductor structures at low temperatures. Indeed, the Aharanov-Bohm effect,
conductance quantization and universal conductance fluctuations are direct
manifestations of the electron wave nature. However, an extension of this
concept to more practical emperatures has not been achieved so far. As
molecules are nano-scale objects with typical energy level spacings (~eV) much
larger than the thermal energy at 300 K (~25 meV), they are natural candidates
to enable such a break-through. Fascinating phenomena including giant
magnetoresistance, Kondo effects and conductance switching, have previously
been demonstrated at the molecular level. Here, we report direct evidence for
destructive quantum interference in charge transport through two-terminal
molecular junctions at room temperature. Furthermore, we show that the degree
of interference can be controlled by simple chemical modifications of the
molecule. Not only does this provide the experimental demonstration of a new
phenomenon in quantum charge transport, it also opens the road for a new type
of molecular devices based on chemical or electrostatic control of quantum
interference.

This holds in particular for the field of comparative network analysis, where
one wants to identify commonalities between biological networks. Since
biological functionality primarily operates at the network level, there is a
clear need for topology-aware comparison methods.
  In this paper we present a method for global network alignment that is fast
and robust, and can flexibly deal with various scoring schemes taking both
node-to-node correspondences as well as network topologies into account. It is
based on an integer linear programming formulation, generalizing the
well-studied quadratic assignment problem. We obtain strong upper and lower
bounds for the problem by improving a Lagrangian relaxation approach and
introduce the software tool natalie 2.0, a publicly available implementation of
our method. In an extensive computational study on protein interaction networks
for six different species, we find that our new method outperforms alternative
state-of-the-art methods with respect to quality and running time.

recently, from MiniBooNE and from reanalyses of reactor experiments following
recent recalculations of reactor fluxes. There are other tentative indications

well. Using the allowed sterile parameter ranges in a 3+1 mixing framework in
order to test these results, we perform a fit assuming active-sterile

oscillation exclusion limits using atmospheric down-going muon neutrino and
anti-neutrino events. We find that (for both \nu_{\mu} and {\bar{\nu_{\mu}}}) a

complementary coverage in these regions, improving sensitivity limits in

analyse the bounds using muon antineutrino events only and compare them with

to these approximation-theoretic results is a characterization of extremal

usual, ""ideal"" source is defined as a source whose proposed function is

generalization to nonlinear 1-ports. Some limitations on the circuit's

ideal source for any load, is the aesthetical point.
