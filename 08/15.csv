storage systems due to their improved error performance, but the high
computational complexity of their decoders is a key obstacle to their adoption
in practice. As discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) can evaluate a polynomial at
multiple points, efficient DFT algorithms are promising in reducing the
computational complexities of syndrome based decoders for long RS codes. In
this paper, we first propose partial composite cyclotomic Fourier transforms
(CCFTs) and then devise syndrome based decoders for long RS codes over large
finite fields based on partial CCFTs. The new decoders based on partial CCFTs
achieve a significant saving of computational complexities for long RS codes.
Since partial CCFTs have modular and regular structures, the new decoders are
suitable for hardware implementations. To further verify and demonstrate the
advantages of partial CCFTs, we implement in hardware the syndrome computation
block for a $(2720, 2550)$ shortened RS code over GF$(2^{12})$. In comparison
to previous results based on Horner's rule, our hardware implementation not
only has a smaller gate count, but also achieves much higher throughputs.

of the operator product expansion approach to the same axial

Taking into account the 4-th order result for $S_{GLS}$ and the perturbative
effects of the violation of the conformal symmetry in the generalized Crewther
relation, we obtain the analytical contribution to the singlet $\alpha_s^4$

recent result of direct diagram-by-diagram evaluation of the singlet 4-th order

be obtained in the conformal invariant limit from the original Crewther
relation. On the contrary to previous belief, the appearance of $zeta_3$-terms
in perturbative series in gauge models does not contradict to the property of
conformal symmetry and can be considered as ragular feature. The Banks-Zaks
motivated relation between our predicted and obtained 4-th order corrections is

space are classified by the Volterra process construction method. We employ the
same method to classify the continuous 2D defects of a vacuum in a 4D maximally
symmetric spacetime. These so-called \textit{cosmic forms} fall into three
classes: i)- $m$-forms, akin to 3D space disclinations, related to ordinary
rotations, analogous to Kibble's global cosmic strings (except that being
continuous any deficit angle is allowed); ii)- $t$-forms, related to Lorentz
boosts (hyperbolic rotations); iii)- $r$-forms, never considered so far,
related to null rotations. A detailed account of their metrics is presented. In
each class, one distinguishes between wedge forms, whose singularities occupy a
2D world sheet, and twist or mixed forms, whose inner structure appears as a
non-singular \textit{core} separated from the outer part by a 3D world shell
with distributional curvature and/or torsion. Relaxation processes of the world
shell involve new types of topological interactions between cosmic dislocations
and cosmic disclinations. The resulting structures of the core region itself
are not explored in this article. Whereas $m$-forms are \textit{compatible}
with the usual cosmological principle (CP) of space homogeneity and isotropy,
$t$- and $r$-forms demand spacetime homogeneity. Thus we advance that $t$- and
$r$-forms are typical of a primeval false vacuum obeying the perfect CP in a de
Sitter spacetime. Cosmic forms may assemble into networks with conservation
laws at their nodes, such that all the segments are made of \textit{positive}
forms, say, thus generating some characteristic curvature field. To this
network may be adjunct a conjugated network made of \textit{negative} forms, in
order to tune the final spatial curvature to a given value.

  Vehicular Technology",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, users
are practically heterogeneous in nature. However, most of the existing user
scheduling algorithms are designed with an implicit assumption that the users
are homogeneous. In this paper, we revisit the problem by exploring the
characteristics of heterogeneous users from a subspace point of view. With an
objective of minimizing interference non-orthogonality among users, three new
angular-based user scheduling criteria that can be applied in various user
scheduling algorithms are proposed. While the first criterion is heuristically
determined by identifying the incapability of largest principal angle to
characterize the subspace correlation and hence the interference
non-orthogonality between users, the second and third ones are derived by
using, respectively, the sum rate capacity bounds with block diagonalization
and the change in capacity by adding a new user into an existing user subset.
Aiming at capturing fairness among heterogeneous users while maintaining
multiuser diversity gain, two new hybrid user scheduling algorithms are also
proposed whose computational complexities are only linearly proportional to the
number of users. We show by simulations that the effectiveness of our proposed
user scheduling criteria and algorithms with respect to those commonly used in

field reversals. These reversals occur in the absence of a dynamo and without
accompanying poloidal field reversals. The nature and presence of such

with north-south symmetric reversals only seen at a particular initial field
strength. Coupled with a dynamo mechanism which regenerates the poloidal field

is very general because this Hamiltonian applies to not only the silicene
itself but also the low-buckled counterparts of graphene for other group IVA
elements Ge and Sn, as well as graphene when the structure returns to the
planar geometry. The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene
quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian. Similar to graphene model, the
effective SOC in low-buckled geometry opens a gap at Dirac points and
establishes QSHE. The effective SOC actually contains first order in the atomic
intrinsic SOC strength $\xi_{0}$, while such leading order contribution of SOC
vanishes in planar structure. Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled
counterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger
gap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled
geometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is
the structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in
low-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature
regime. In addition, the Rashba SOC in silicene is intrinsic due to its own
low-buckled geometry, which vanishes at Dirac point $K$, while has nonzero
value with $\vec{k}$ deviation from the $K$ point. Therefore, the QSHE in
silicene is robust against to the intrinsic Rashba SOC.

sublattice symmetry of un-doped graphene is discussed. We formulate a strong
coupling expansion where the ground state of the Coulomb Hamiltonian is found
exactly and the kinetic hopping Hamiltonian is treated as a perturbation. We
argue that many of the properties of the resulting system would be shared by
graphene with a Hubbard model interaction. In particular, the best candidate
sublattice symmetry breaking ground state is an antiferromagnetic Mott
insulator. We discuss the results of some numerical simulations which indicate
that the Coulomb interaction is indeed subcritical. We also point out the
curious fact that, if the electron did not have spin degeneracy, the tendency
to break chiral symmetry would be much greater and even relatively weak Coulomb
interactions would likely gap the spectrum.

empirical oblateness relation), we calculate dynamical disk mass surface
densities from stellar kinematics, which provide vertical velocity dispersions
after correcting for the shape of the stellar velocity ellipsoid (measured to
have sigma_theta/sigma_R=1.04 +/- 0.22 and sigma_z/sigma_R=0.48 +/- 0.09). We
isolate the stellar mass surface density by accounting for all gas mass

al. predict, respectively, 0.56 and 3.6 times our dynamical value based on
stellar-population-synthesis modeling. The baryonic matter is submaximal by a
factor of ~3 in mass and the baryonic-to-total circular-speed ratio is
0.61^{+0.07}_{-0.09} (ran) ^{+0.12}_{-0.18} (sys) at 2.2 h_R; however, the disk
is globally stable with a multi-component stability that decreases
asymptotically with radius to Q~2. We directly calculate the circular speed of
the DM halo by subtracting the baryonic contribution to the total circular
speed; the result is equally well described by either a Navarro-Frenk-White
halo or a pseudo-isothermal sphere. The volume density is dominated by DM at
heights of |z|>1.6 h_z for radii of R > h_R. As is shown in follow-up papers,
UGC 463 is just one example among nearly all galaxies we have observed that
contradict the hypothesis that high-surface-brightness spiral galaxies have

in spectral lines and the continuum. In the outer layers of a stellar
atmosphere the anisotropy of the radiation field is typically dominated by the
radiation escaping away, but local horizontal fluctuations of the physical
conditions may also contribute, distorting the illumination and hence, the
polarization pattern. Additionally, a magnetic field may perturb and modify the
line scattering polarization signals through the Hanle effect. Here, we study
such symmetry-breaking effects. We develop a method to solve the transfer of
polarized radiation in a scattering atmosphere with weak horizontal
fluctuations of the opacity and source functions. It comprises linearization
(small opacity fluctuations are assumed), reduction to a quasi-planeparallel
problem through harmonic analysis, and numerical solution by generalized
standard techniques. We apply this method to study scattering polarization in
atmospheres with horizontal fluctuations in the Planck function and opacity. We
derive several very general results and constraints from considerations on the
symmetries and dimensionality of the problem, and we give explicit solutions of
a few illustrative problems of especial interest. For example, we show (a) how
the amplitudes of the fractional linear polarization signals change when
considering increasingly smaller horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities, (b)
that in the presence of such inhomogeneities even a vertical magnetic field may
modify the scattering line polarization, and (c) that forward scattering
polarization may be produced without the need of an inclined magnetic field.

benchmarks for multidimensional radiative transfer codes.

correlation between these two features by applying experimental and theoretical
techniques on two specific medium-sized/large PAHs (dibenzorubicene C30H14 and
hexabenzocoronene C42H18) in their neutral and cationic states. It was already
shown that mixtures of sufficiently large, neutral PAHs can partly or even
completely account for the UV bump. We investigated how the absorption bands
are altered upon ionization of these molecules by interstellar UV photons. The
experimental studies presented here were realized by performing matrix
isolation spectroscopy with subsequent far-UV irradiation. The main effects
were found to be a broadening of the absorption bands in the UV combined with
slight red shifts. The position of the complete pi - pi* absorption structure
around 217.5 nm, however, remains more or less unchanged which could explain
the observed position invariance of the interstellar bump for different lines
of sight. This favors the assignment of this feature to the interstellar PAH
population. As far as the DIBs are concerned, neither our investigations nor
the laboratory studies carried out by other research groups support a possible
connection with this class of molecules. Instead, there are reasonable
arguments that neutral and singly ionized cationic PAHs cannot be made

scattering were incorporated into the code.
  $\epsilon$ Aurigae is one of the most mysterious objects on the sky. Prior
modeling of its light-curve assumed dark, inclined, disk of dust with the
central hole to explain the light-curve with a sharp mid-eclipse brightening.
Our model consists of two geometrically thick flared disks. Internal optically
thick disk and external optically thin disk which absorbs and scatters
radiation. Shallow mid-eclipse brightening may result from eclipses by nearly
edge-on flared (dusty or gaseous) disks. Mid-eclipse brightening may also be
due to strong forward scattering and optical properties of the dust which can
have an important effect on the light-curves.
  There are many similarities between interacting binary stars and transiting
extrasolar planets. Reflection effect which is briefly reviewed is one of them.
The exact Roche shape and temperature distributions over the surface of all
currently known transiting extrasolar planets have been determined. In some
cases (HAT-P-32b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b) departures from the spherical shape can
reach 7-15%.

sub-microsecond timescales with non-ergodic systems.
  A case study for the Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) at the
European XFEL employing the intensity autocorrelation technique was performed
using the detector simulation tool HORUS. As optimum results from XPCS
experiments are obtained when the pixel size approximates the (small) speckle
size, the presented study compares the AGIPD (pixel size of (200 $\upmu$m)$^2$)
to a possible apertured version of the detector and to a hypothetical system
with (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$ pixel size and investigates the influence of intensity
fluctuations and incoherent noise on the quality of the acquired data.
  The intuitive conclusion that aperturing is not beneficial as data is 'thrown
away' was proven to be correct for low intensities. For intensities larger than
approximately 1 photon per (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$ aperturing was found to be
beneficial, as charge sharing effects were excluded by it.
  It was shown that for the investigated case (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$ pixels
produced significantly better results than (200 $\upmu$m)$^2$ pixels when the
average intensity exceeded approximately 0.05 photons per (100 $\upmu$m)$^2$.
  Although the systems were quite different in design they varied in the signal
to noise ratio only by a factor of 2-3, and even less in the relative error of
the extracted correlation constants. However the dependence on intensity showed
distinctively different features for the different systems.

transparently built into that expression. The energies and structures of the

shorter motifs that interlink in only one shared site variable. Structures

local Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) to create kinematic maps. By means
of these, we classify the kinematics of these galaxies into three different
classes: rotating disk (RD), perturbed rotation (PR), and complex kinematics
(CK). We find 48% are RDs, 28% are PRs, and 24% are CKs. RDs show rotational
velocities that range between $\sim50$ and $\sim200 km s^{-1}$, and dynamical
masses that range between $\sim1\times10^{9}$ and $\sim3\times10^{10}
M_{\odot}$. We also address the following two fundamental questions through the
study of the kinematic maps: \emph{(i) What processes are triggering the
current starbust in LCBGs?} We search our maps of the galaxy velocity fields
for signatures of recent interactions and close companions that may be
responsible for the enhanced star formation in our sample. We find 5% of
objects show evidence of a recent major merger, 10% of a minor merger, and 45%
of a companion. This argues in favor of ongoing interactions with close
companions as a mechanism for the enhanced star formation activity in these
galaxies. \emph{(ii) What processes may eventually quench the current starbust
in LCBGs?} Velocity and velocity width maps, together with emission line ratio
maps, can reveal signatures of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity or
supernova (SN) driven galactic winds that could halt the current burst. We find
only 5% of objects with clear evidence of AGN activity, and 27% with kinematics
consistent with SN-driven galactic winds. Therefore, a different mechanism may
be responsible for quenching the star formation in LCBGs. Finally, from our
analysis, we find that the velocity widths of RDs, rather than accounting
exclusively for the rotational nature of these objects, may account as well for
other kinematic components, and may not be good tracers of their dynamical
masses.

rules of band edge transitions, the injection in each conduction band valley,

phonon-assisted transitions dominate the injection at low photon energies, and
the TO phonon-assisted at high photon energies. At 300 K, the former dominates
at all photon energies of interest. The carrier injection shows anisotropy and
linear-circular dichroism with respect to light propagation direction. For
light propagating along the $<001>$ direction, the carrier injection exhibits
valley anisotropy, and the injection into the $Z$ conduction band valley is
larger than that into the $X/Y$ valleys. For $\sigma^-$ light propagating along
the $<001>$ ($<111>$) direction, the degree of spin polarization gives a
maximum value about 20% (6%) at 4 K and -10% (20%) at 300 K, and at both

contributions from different phonon branches. Forthe two-color coherent current
injection with an incident optical field composed of a fundamental frequency

positive jumps and arbitrary negative jumps. Using the results from the theory
of entire functions of Cartwright class we prove that the positive Wiener-Hopf
factor can be expressed as an infinite product in terms of the solutions to the
equation $\psi(z)=q$, where $\psi$ is the Laplace exponent of the process.
Under some additional regularity assumptions on the Levy measure we obtain an
asymptotic expression for these solutions, which is important for numerical
computations. In the case when the process is spectrally negative with bounded
jumps, we derive a series representation for the scale function in terms of the
solutions to the equation $\psi(z)=q$. To illustrate possible applications we
discuss the implementation of numerical algorithms and present the results of
several numerical experiments.

p\to p\eta$ from MAMI are presented. A fit using known broad resonances and
only standard background amplitudes can not describe the relatively narrow
peaking structure in the cross section in the mass region of 1660-1750 MeV
which follows a minimum. An improved description of the data can be reached by
either assuming the existence of a narrow resonance at a mass of about 1700 MeV
with small photo-coupling or by a threshold effect. In the latter case the
observed structure is explained by a strong (resonant or non-resonant) $\gamma
p\to\omega p$ coupling in the $S_{11}$ partial wave. When the beam asymmetry
data, published by part of the GRAAL collaboration, are included in the fit,
the solution with a narrow $P_{11}$ state is slightly preferred. In that fit,
mass and width of the hypothetical resonance are determined to $M\sim$1694 MeV
and $\Gamma\sim 40$ MeV, respectively, and the photo-coupling to $\sqrt{{\rm
Br}_{\eta N}} A_{1/2}^p \sim 2.6\cdot 10^{-3}$ GeV$^{-1/2}$. High precision
measurements of the target asymmetry and $F$-observable are mandatory to
establish the possible existence of such a narrow state and to provide the
necessary information to define which partial wave is responsible for the
structure observed in the data.

temperature T varies from T = 150 K to T = 165 K, the Gd3+ ESR fine and
hyperfine structures coalesce into a broad inhomogeneous single resonance. At T
= 200 K the line narrows and as T increases further, the resonance becomes
homogeneous with a thermal broadening of 1.1(2) Oe/K. These results suggest
that the origin of these features may be associated to a subtle interdependence
of thermally activated mechanisms that combine: i) an increase with T of the
density of activated conduction-carriers across the T-dependent semiconducting
pseudogap; ii) the Gd3+ Korringa relaxation process due to an exchange
interaction, J_{fd}S.s, between the Gd3+ localized magnetic moments and the
thermally activated conduction-carriers and; iii) a relatively weak confining
potential of the rare-earth ions inside the oversized (Fe2P3)4 cage, which
allows the rare-earths to become rattler Einstein oscillators above T = 148 K.
We argue that the rattling of the Gd3+ ions, via a motional narrowing
mechanism, also contributes to the coalescence of the ESR fine and hyperfine

for deformable or moving targets of the spine, abdomen, thorax, breast, head

Results: The algorithm delivers a multi-criteria optimization framework

in the developed countries in recent years; manufacturing is decreasing while
the service sector is becoming more important. However, currently most
simulation models for investigating service systems are still built in the same
way as manufacturing simulation models, using a process-oriented world view,
i.e. they model the flow of passive entities through a system. These kinds of
models allow studying aspects of operational management but are not well suited
for studying the dynamics that appear in service systems due to human
behaviour. For these kinds of studies we require tools that allow modelling the
system and entities using an object-oriented world view, where intelligent
objects serve as abstract ""actors"" that are goal directed and can behave
proactively. In our work we combine process-oriented discrete event simulation
modelling and object-oriented agent based simulation modelling to investigate
the impact of people management practices on retail productivity. In this
paper, we reveal in a series of experiments what impact considering proactivity
can have on the output accuracy of simulation models of human centric systems.
The model and data we use for this investigation are based on a case study in a
UK department store. We show that considering proactivity positively influences
the validity of these kinds of models and therefore allows analysts to make
better recommendations regarding strategies to apply people management
practises.

characterizing stimuli) and a set of several stochastically non-independent
outputs (e.g., random variables describing different aspects of responses), how
can one determine, for each of the outputs, which of the inputs it is
influenced by? The problem has applications ranging from modeling pairwise
comparisons to reconstructing mental processing architectures to conjoint
testing. A necessary and sufficient condition for a given pattern of selective
influences is provided by the Joint Distribution Criterion, according to which
the problem of ""what influences what"" is equivalent to that of the existence of
a joint distribution for a certain set of random variables. For inputs and
outputs with finite sets of values this criterion translates into a test of
consistency of a certain system of linear equations and inequalities (Linear
Feasibility Test) which can be performed by means of linear programming. The
Joint Distribution Criterion also leads to a metatheoretical principle for
generating a broad class of necessary conditions (tests) for diagrams of
selective influences. Among them is the class of distance-type tests based on
the observation that certain functionals on jointly distributed random
variables satisfy triangle inequality.

(DFT) we studied the effect of hydrogenation on electronic properties of
armchair single-wall carbon nanotubes. The calculations demonstrate strong
preference for formation of monoatomic H chains along the (5,5) nanotube axis
with the H binding in an infinite H chain reaching the value of 2.58 eV per
atom. Upon formation of chains of H adatoms, initially metallic (5,5) nanotubes
change electronic structure to the semiconducting. The opening of the band gap
of $\sim$0.6 eV is accompanied with antiferromagnetic coupling of
ferromagnetically ordered magnetic moments on C atoms in vicinity of the H
chain. These electronic properties are strikingly similar to those previously
observed in narrow graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges.

recovering lost information. In this paper, we present a novel iterative
phase-retrieval algorithm using a sparse representation of the object amplitude
and phase. The algorithm is derived in terms of a constrained maximum
likelihood, where the wave field reconstruction is performed using a number of
noisy intensity-only observations with a zero-mean additive Gaussian noise. The
developed algorithm enables the optimal solution for the object wave field
reconstruction. Our goal is an improvement of the reconstruction quality with
respect to the conventional algorithms. Sparse regularization results in
advanced reconstruction accuracy, and numerical simulations demonstrate
significant enhancement of imaging.

  proceedings, in Physics Procedia",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Podkletnov effect is an unexplained loss of weight of between 0.05% and
0.07% detected in test masses suspended above supercooled levitating
superconducting discs exposed to AC magnetic fields. A larger weight loss of up
to 0.5% was seen over a disc spun at 5000 rpm. The effect has so far been
observed in only one laboratory. Here, a new model for inertia that assumes
that inertial mass is caused by Unruh radiation which is subject to a
Hubble-scale Casimir effect (called MiHsC or quantised inertia) is applied to
this anomaly. When the disc is exposed to the AC magnetic field it vibrates
(accelerates), and MiHsC then predicts that the inertial mass of the nearby
test mass increases, so that to conserve momentum it must accelerate upwards
against freefall by 0.0029 m/s^2 or 0.03% of g, about half of the weight loss
observed. With disc rotation, MiHsC predicts an additional weight loss, but 28
times smaller than the rotational effect observed. MiHsC suggests that the
effect should increase with disc radius and rotation rate, the AC magnetic
field strength (as observed), and also with increasing latitude and for lighter
discs.
