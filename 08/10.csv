associated tool that can allow various kinds of operations to be performed in a
simple way. Different kinds of annotation frameworks and many query languages
for them have been proposed, including some to deal with multiple layers of
annotation. We present here an easy to learn query language for a particular
kind of annotation framework based on 'threaded trees', which are somewhere
between the complete order of a tree and the anarchy of a graph. Through
'typed' threads, they can allow multiple levels of annotation in the same
document. Our language has a simple, intuitive and concise syntax and high
expressive power. It allows not only to search for complicated patterns with
short queries but also allows data manipulation and specification of arbitrary
return values. Many of the commonly used tasks that otherwise require writing
programs, can be performed with one or more queries. We compare the language
with some others and try to evaluate it.

simplicial gravity and (Euclidean) Regge calculus, in particular. A discrete
forward/backward evolution is realized by gluing/removing single simplices step
by step to/from a bulk triangulation and amounts to Pachner moves in the
triangulated hypersurfaces. As a result, the hypersurfaces evolve in a discrete
`multi-fingered' time through the full Regge solution. Pachner moves are an
elementary and ergodic class of homeomorphisms and generically change the
number of variables, but can be implemented as canonical transformations on
naturally extended phase spaces. Some moves introduce a priori free data which,
however, may become fixed a posteriori by constraints arising in subsequent
moves. The end result is a general and fully consistent formulation of
canonical Regge calculus, thereby removing a longstanding obstacle in
connecting covariant simplicial gravity models to canonical frameworks. The
present scheme is, therefore, interesting in view of many approaches to quantum
gravity, but may also prove useful for numerical implementations.

of many standard tools used for investigating the statistical properties of
cosmological random fields. They have found regular use in studies of
departures from Gaussianity in a number of important cosmological scenarios.
Important examples include the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), weak lensing
studies, 21cm surveys and large scale structure (LSS). To lowest order the MFs
depend on three generalised skewness parameters that can be shown to probe the
bispectrum with differing weights. Recent studies have advocated the use of a
power spectrum associated with the bispectrum, called the skew-spectrum, that
has more power to distinguish between various contributions to the bispectrum
than the conventional formalism adopted when using the Minkowski Functionals.
In this article we review the motivations for studying non-Gaussianity and
emphasize the importance of the momentum dependence of higher order correlators
in investigating both inflationary and early Universe models as well as
analytical models for gravitational instability. We then introduce the
skew-spectra, applied to galaxy surveys, as a tool for investigating various
models for primordial and gravitationally induced non-Gaussianities. We present
analytical expressions for the skew-spectra for the density field and
divergence of the velocity field in 3D and for projected surveys as a function
of redshift and a smoothing angular scale. A Gaussian window function is
assumed throughout this paper. Analytical results are derived for the case of
gravitationally induced non-Gaussianity. These results can be generalised to
incorporate redshift space effects. This will be useful in probing primordial
and gravitationally induced non-Gaussianity from ongoing and future galaxy
surveys.

relativity theory and the signaling abilities of probabilistic devices with
inputs and outputs: while time-reversal in relativity will not introduce the
ability to signal between spacelike separated regions, this is not the case for
probabilistic devices with space-like separated input-output pairs. We
explicitly describe a non-signaling device which becomes a perfect signaling
device under time-reversal, where time-reversal can be conceptualized as
playing backwards a videotape of an agent manipulating the device. This leads
to an arrow of time that is identifiable when studying the correlations of
events for spacelike separated regions. Somewhat surprisingly, although
time-reversal of Popuscu-Roerlich boxes also allows agents to signal, it does
not yield a perfect signaling device. Finally, we realize time-reversal using
post-selection, which could lead experimental implementation.

necessitate the design of distributed cross-layer optimization algorithms. So
far, the standard approach of distributed cross-layer design is based on dual
decomposition and the subgradient algorithm, which is a first-order method that
has a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we focus on solving a joint
multi-path routing and flow control (MRFC) problem by designing a new
distributed Newton's method, which is a second-order method and enjoys a
quadratic rate of convergence. The major challenges in developing a distributed
Newton's method lie in decentralizing the computation of the Hessian matrix and
its inverse for both the primal Newton direction and dual variable updates. By
appropriately reformulating, rearranging, and exploiting the special problem
structures, we show that it is possible to decompose such computations into
source nodes and links in the network, thus eliminating the need for global
information. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for both the primal
Newton direction and dual variable updates, thus significantly reducing the
computational complexity. The most attractive feature of our proposed
distributed Newton's method is that it requires almost the same scale of
information exchange as in first-order methods, while achieving a quadratic
rate of convergence as in centralized Newton methods. We provide extensive
numerical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm. Our
work contributes to the advanced paradigm shift in cross-layer network design
that is evolving from first-order to second-order methods.

such distinctiveness extends to the disease dynamics. Under these hypothesis,
we show that two asymptotic regimes naturally appear: the fast host dynamics
and the fast vector dynamics. The former regime yields, at leading order, a SIR
model for the hosts, but with a rational incidence rate. In this case, the
vector disappears from the model, and the dynamics is similar to a directly
contagious disease. The latter yields a SI model for the vectors, with the
hosts disappearing from the model. Numerical results show the performance of
the approximation, and a rigorous proof validates the reduced models.

as a spin system analogue of emergent geometry and gravity. Graphs with regions
of high connectivity in the lattice were identified as candidate analogues of
spacetime geometries that contain trapped surfaces. We carry out a detailed
study of these systems and show explicitly that the highly connected subgraphs
trap matter. We do this by solving the model in the limit of no back-reaction
of the matter on the lattice, and for states with certain symmetries that are
natural for our problem. We find that in this case the problem reduces to a
one-dimensional Hubbard model on a lattice with variable vertex degree and
multiple edges between the same two vertices. In addition, we obtain a
(discrete) differential equation for the evolution of the probability density
of particles which is closed in the classical regime. This is a wave equation
in which the vertex degree is related to the local speed of propagation of
probability. This allows an interpretation of the probability density of
particles similar to that in analogue gravity systems: matter inside this
analogue system sees a curved spacetime. We verify our analytic results by
numerical simulations. Finally, we analyze the dependence of localization on a
gradual, rather than abrupt, fall-off of the vertex degree on the boundary of
the highly connected region and find that matter is localized in and around
that region.

the most promising candidates to explain this excess of emission is electric
dipole radiation from rapidly rotating very small dust grains, commonly
referred to as spinning dust. Photometric data obtained with the Spitzer Space
Telescope have been reprocessed and used in conjunction with the dust emission
model DUSTEM to characterise the properties of the dust within the cloud. This
analysis has allowed us to constrain spatial variations in the strength of the
interstellar radiation field ($\chi_\mathrm{ISRF}$), the mass abundances of the
PAHs and VSGs relative to the BGs (Y$_\mathrm{PAH}$ and Y$_\mathrm{VSG}$), the
column density of hydrogen (N$_\mathrm{H}$) and the equilibrium dust
temperature (T$_\mathrm{dust}$). The parameter maps of Y$_\mathrm{PAH}$,
Y$_\mathrm{VSG}$ and $\chi_\mathrm{ISRF}$ are the first of their kind to be
produced for the Perseus cloud, and we used these maps to investigate the
physical conditions in which anomalous emission is observed. We find that in
regions of anomalous emission the strength of the ISRF, and consequently the
equilibrium temperature of the dust, is enhanced while there is no significant
variation in the abundances of the PAHs and the VSGs or the column density of
hydrogen. We interpret these results as an indication that the enhancement in
$\chi_\mathrm{ISRF}$ might be affecting the properties of the small
stochastically heated dust grains resulting in an increase in the spinning dust
emission observed at 33 GHz. This is the first time that such an investigation
has been performed, and we believe that this type of analysis creates a new
perspective in the field of anomalous emission studies, and represents a
powerful new tool for constraining spinning dust models.

Symmetric Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SSPE). The characterized SSPE is
stationary when re-entry in the auction is allowed, and it is Markov perfect
when re-entry is forbidden. Furthermore, we fully characterize the expected
revenue of the seller. Generally, with or without re-entry, it is more
beneficial for the seller to choose $v$ (value of the object), $s$ (sale
price), and $c$ (bidding fee) such that $\frac{v-s}{c}$ becomes sufficiently
large. In particular, when re-entry is permitted: the expected revenue of the
seller is \emph{independent} of the number of bidders, decreasing in the sale
price, increasing in the value of the object, and decreasing in the bidding
fee; Moreover, the seller's revenue is equal to the value of the object when
players are risk neutral, and it is strictly greater than the value of the
object when bidders are risk-loving. We further show that allowing re-entry can
be important in practice. Because, if the seller were to run such an auction
without allowing re-entry, the auction would last a long time, and for almost
all of its duration have only two remaining players. Thus, the seller's revenue
relies on those two players being willing to participate, without any breaks,
in an auction that might last for thousands of rounds

winds which still lack clear physical explanation. Among these phenomena are
photospheric turbulence, line profile variability (LPV), non-thermal emission,
non-radial pulsations, discrete absorption components (DACs) and wind clumping.
Cantiello et al. (2009) argued that a convection zone close to the stellar
surface could be responsible for some of these phenomena. This convective zone
is caused by a peak in the opacity associated with iron-group elements and is
referred to as the ""iron convection zone"" (FeCZ). Assuming dynamo action
producing magnetic fields at equipartition in the FeCZ, we investigate the
occurrence of subsurface magnetism in OB stars. Then we study the surface
emergence of these magnetic fields and discuss possible observational
signatures of magnetic spots. Simple estimates are made using the subsurface
properties of massive stars, as calculated in 1D stellar evolution models. We
find that magnetic fields of sufficient amplitude to affect the wind could
emerge at the surface via magnetic buoyancy. While at this stage it is
difficult to predict the geometry of these features, we show that magnetic
spots of size comparable to the local pressure scale height can manifest
themselves as hot, bright spots. Localized magnetic fields could be widespread
in those early type stars that have subsurface convection. This type of surface
magnetism could be responsible for photometric variability and play a role in
X-ray emission and wind clumping.

E(B-V)g steadily increases from 1.5 mag at r = 1 pc to 1.7 mag at r = 2 pc, and
stays nearly constant at 1.7 mag for 2 pc < r < 3 pc. The different radial
profiles and the pixel-to-pixel variations of E(B-V)g clearly indicate the
presence of significant differential reddening across the 4.9 pc \times 4.3 pc
area centered on the HD 97950 star cluster. We interpret the variations of
E(B-V)g as the result of stellar radiation and stellar winds interacting with
an inhomogeneous dusty local interstellar medium (ISM) whose density varies
spatially. From the E(B-V)g values measured along the rims of the prominent
pillars MM1 and MM2 in the southwest and southeast of the HD 97950 cluster we
estimate an H2 column density of log10(N(H2))=21.7 and extrapolate it to
log10(N(H2))=23 in the pillars' interior. We find the pillars to be closer to
us than the central ionizing cluster and suggest that star formation may be
occurring in the pillar heads.

linear separation into a combination of E, B and mixed modes, and ignoring the
latter. With current computational power and for typical resolutions
appropriate for r detection, the large matrix inversions required are accurate
and fast. We explore two classes of experiments. One is motivated by a long
duration balloon experiment like Spider, with pixel noise \propto \sqrt{fsky}
for a specified observing period, but also applies to ground-based array
experiments. We find that, ignoring systematic effects and foregrounds, an
experiment with Spider-like noise over fsky ~0.02-0.2 could place a 2sigma_r
~0.014 (~95% CL) bound, rising to 0.02 with an L-dependent foreground residual.
We contrast this with a Planck-like fixed instrumental noise as fsky varies,
which gives a Galaxy-masked (fsky = 0.75) 2sigma_r ~0.015, rising to ~0.05 with
the foreground residuals. Using for a figure of merit the (marginalized) 1D
Shannon entropy of r, taken relative to the first 2003 WMAP1 CMB-only
constraint, gives -1.7 (-1.9) bits from the 2010 WMAP7+ACT (2011 WMAP7+SPT)

which are otherwise hard to overcome classically at low temperatures. However,
this is not always the case. In this paper we provide simple exactly solvable
examples where the barriers each system encounters on its approach to lower and
lower energy states become increasingly large and eventually scale with the
system size. If the environment couples locally to the physical degrees of
freedom in the system, tunnelling under large barriers requires processes whose
order in perturbation theory is proportional to the width of the barrier. This
results in quantum relaxation rates that are exponentially suppressed in system
size: For these quantum systems, no physical bath can provide a mechanism for
relaxation that is not dynamically arrested at low temperatures. The examples
discussed here are drawn from three dimensional generalizations of Kitaev's
toric code, originally devised in the context of topological quantum computing.
They are devoid of any local order parameters or symmetry breaking and are thus
examples of topological quantum glasses. We construct systems that have slow
dynamics similar to either strong or fragile glasses. The example with

three methods to diagnose disc presence from infrared measurements. We find no
significant difference in the mean ages or age distributions of stars with and
without discs, consistent with expectations for a coeval population. Using a
simple quantitative model we show that any real age spread must be smaller than
the median disc lifetime. For a log-normal age distribution, there is an upper
limit of <0.14 dex (at 99% confidence) to any real age dispersion, compared to
the ~=0.4 dex implied by the H-R diagram. If the mean age of the ONC is 2.5
Myr, this would mean at least 95% of its low-mass stellar population has ages
between 1.3--4.8 Myr. We suggest that the observed luminosity dispersion is
caused by a combination of observational uncertainties and physical mechanisms
that disorder the conventional relationship between luminosity and age for pre
main-sequence stars. This means that individual stellar ages from the H-R
diagram are unreliable and cannot be used to directly infer a star formation
history. Irrespective of what causes the wide luminosity dispersion, the
finding that any real age dispersion is less than the median disc lifetime
argues strongly against star formation scenarios for the ONC lasting longer
than a few Myr.

the Uncertain Nearest Neighbor (UNN) rule is here introduced, which represents
the generalization of the deterministic nearest neighbor rule to the case in
which uncertain objects are available. The UNN rule relies on the concept of
nearest neighbor class, rather than on that of nearest neighbor object. The
nearest neighbor class of a test object is the class that maximizes the
probability of providing its nearest neighbor. It is provided evidence that the
former concept is much more powerful than the latter one in the presence of
uncertainty, in that it correctly models the right semantics of the nearest
neighbor decision rule when applied to the uncertain scenario. An effective and
efficient algorithm to perform uncertain nearest neighbor classification of a
generic (un)certain test object is designed, based on properties that greatly
reduce the temporal cost associated with nearest neighbor class probability
computation. Experimental results are presented, showing that the UNN rule is
effective and efficient in classifying uncertain data.

active elements in nanoelectronic devices, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)
and multifunctional nanocomposites. The interplay between the network
nanostructure and the its properties is crucial, yet current understanding
remains limited to the passive response. Here, we employ a novel superstructure
consisting of millimeter-long vertically aligned singe walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) sandwiched between polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers to quantify the
effect of two classes of mechanical stimuli, film densification and stretching,
on the electronic and thermal transport across the network. The network deforms
easily with increase in electrical and thermal conductivities suggestive of
floppy yet highly reconfigurable network. Insight from atomistically informed
coarse-grained simulations uncover an interplay between the extent of lateral
assembly of the bundles, modulated by surface zipping/unzipping, and the
elastic energy associated with the bent conformations of the nanotubes/bundles.
During densification, the network becomes highly interconnected yet we observe
a modest increase in bundling primarily due to the reduced spacing between the
SWCNTs. The stretching, on the other hand, is characterized by an initial
debundling regime as the strain accommodation occurs via unzipping of the
branched interconnects, followed by rapid re-bundling as the strain transfers
to the increasingly aligned bundles. In both cases, the increase in the
electrical and thermal conductivity is primarily due to the increase in bundle
size; the changes in network connectivity have a minor effect on the transport.
Our results have broad implications for filamentous networks of inorganic
nanoassemblies composed of interacting tubes, wires and ribbons/belts.

by recent experiments, we study the effects of coarse-graining in photon number
measurements on the observability of micro-macro entanglement that is created
by greatly amplifying one photon from an entangled pair. We compare the results
obtained for a unitary quantum cloner, which generates micro-macro
entanglement, and for a measure-and-prepare cloner, which produces a separable
micro-macro state. We show that the distance between the probability
distributions of results for the two cloners approaches zero for a fixed
moderate amount of coarse-graining. Proving the presence of micro-macro
entanglement therefore becomes progressively harder as the system size
increases.

the graphene is rotationally disordered and interactions between the graphene
and substrate lead to a shift in the Dirac crossing of $\sim$ -0.3 eV and the
opening of a $\sim$ 250 meV gap. Exposure of the samples to air resulted in
intercalation of oxygen under the graphene on Cu(100), which formed a
($\sqrt{2} \times 2\sqrt{2}$)R45$^{\rm o}$ superstructure. The effect of this
intercalation on the graphene $\pi$ bands is to increase the offset of the
Dirac crossing ($\sim$ -0.6 eV) and enlarge the gap ($\sim$ 350 meV). No such
effect is observed for the graphene on Cu(111) sample, with the surface state
at $\Gamma$ not showing the gap associated with a surface superstructure. The
graphene film is found to protect the surface state from air exposure, with no

observed star-formation rates in all but the most extreme cases and must be
included in any assessment of the gas-mass budget of a central cluster galaxy.

  Correctly","A shorter version is in submission to IEEE INFOCOM 2012",,,,"cs.NI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network coding achieves optimal throughput in multicast networks. However,
throughput optimality \emph{relies} on the network nodes or routers to code
\emph{correctly}. A Byzantine node may introduce junk packets in the network
(thus polluting downstream packets and causing the sinks to receive the wrong
data) or may choose coding coefficients in a way that significantly reduces the
throughput of the network.
  Most prior work focused on the problem of Byzantine nodes polluting packets.
However, even if a Byzantine node does not pollute packets, he can still affect
significantly the throughput of the network by not coding correctly. No
previous work attempted to verify if a certain node \emph{coded correctly using
random coefficients} over \emph{all} of the packets he was supposed to code
over.
  We provide two novel protocols (which we call PIP and Log-PIP) for detecting
whether a node coded correctly over all the packets received (i.e., according
to a random linear network coding algorithm). Our protocols enable any node in
the network to examine a packet received from another node by running a
""verification test"". With our protocols, the worst an adversary can do and
still pass the packet verification test is in fact equivalent to random linear
network coding, which has been shown to be optimal in multicast networks. Our
protocols resist collusion among nodes and are applicable to a variety of
settings.
  Our topology simulations show that the throughput in the worst case for our
protocol is two to three times larger than the throughput in various
adversarial strategies allowed by prior work. We implemented our protocols in
C/C++ and Java, as well as incorporated them on the Android platform (Nexus
One). Our evaluation shows that our protocols impose modest overhead.

to transform them into smaller aggregates, even in short time periods (days).

helicity provides remarkable resilience to backscattering even in the presence

states' wavelength diverges bulk doping results in pronounced nanoscale spatial
fluctuations of energy, momentum, and helicity. Our results and their

important to know whether cancer cells with higher tumorigenic potential, such
as cancer stem cells, are only a small subpopulation. We attempt to address the
question of variability in tumorigenic potential based on the heterogeneity in
apoptosis resistance of cancer cells. We use stochastic differential equations
and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to explore the mechanisms that generate
cell-to-cell variability in apoptosis resistance of cancer cells. In our model,
a simplified scheme of apoptosis signaling reactions is developed focusing on
the proapoptotic Bid-Bax reaction and its inhibition by Bcl-2 like
antiapoptotic proteins. We show how a combination of low probability Bid-Bax
reaction along with overexpressed reactant molecules allows specific killing of
cancer cells, especially under targeted therapy such as Bcl-2 inhibition. This
low probability Bid-Bax reaction protects normal cells from accidental
apoptosis but generates cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptotic
activation of cells equipped with overexpressed Bid and Bax molecules. We
further demonstrate that cellular variations in Bcl-2 / Bax ratio, within a
cancer cell population, can affect the intrinsic fluctuations arising from the
stochastic Bid-Bax reaction and thereby provides a mechanism for origin of
cells with higher tumorigenic potential. We discuss the implications of our
results for cancer therapy, such as, optimal strategies to minimize stochastic

weakly acyclic game, from any starting state, there is a sequence of
better-response moves that leads to a pure Nash equilibrium; informally, these
are games in which natural distributed dynamics, such as better-response
dynamics, cannot enter inescapable oscillations. We establish a novel link
between such games and the existence of pure Nash equilibria in subgames.
Specifically, we show that the existence of a unique pure Nash equilibrium in
every subgame implies the weak acyclicity of a game. In contrast, the possible
existence of multiple pure Nash equilibria in every subgame is insufficient for
weak acyclicity in general; here, we also systematically identify the special
cases (in terms of the number of players and strategies) for which this is
sufficient to guarantee weak acyclicity.

etc.) emerged in recent years that allow requesters from all around the world
to post tasks and seek help from an equally global pool of workers. However,
intrinsic incentive problems reside in crowdsourcing applications as workers
and requester are selfish and aim to strategically maximize their own benefit.
In this paper, we propose to provide incentives for workers to exert effort
using a novel game-theoretic model based on repeated games. As there is always
a gap in the social welfare between the non-cooperative equilibria emerging
when workers pursue their self-interests and the desirable Pareto efficient
outcome, we propose a novel class of incentive protocols based on social norms
which integrates reputation mechanisms into the existing pricing schemes
currently implemented on crowdsourcing websites, in order to improve the
performance of the non-cooperative equilibria emerging in such applications. We
first formulate the exchanges on a crowdsourcing website as a two-sided market
where requesters and workers are matched and play gift-giving games repeatedly.
Subsequently, we study the protocol designer's problem of finding an optimal
and sustainable (equilibrium) protocol which achieves the highest social
welfare for that website. We prove that the proposed incentives protocol can
make the website operate close to Pareto efficiency. Moreover, we also examine
an alternative scenario, where the protocol designer aims at maximizing the
revenue of the website and evaluate the performance of the optimal protocol.

So,

near deterministic ideas. An adversary might deduce sensitive information by
observing the contextual data, which when correlated with prior information
about the people and the physical locations that are being monitored by a set
of sensors can reveal most of the sensitive information. So, it is obvious that
for security and privacy preservation in ubiquitous computing context

provides two layer privacy protection of user's or application's context data.
Our proposed context protecting privacy preservation scheme focuses on

argue that if the motion is relativistic, the high superluminal velocities
beta_{app} ~ gamma, expected in the case of an homokinetic jet, are only
possible for geometrical collimation smaller than the relativistic beaming
angle 1/gamma. This is relatively independent of the jet velocity profile. For
jet collimation angles larger than 1/gamma, the apparent image of the jet will
always be dominated by parts of the jet traveling directly towards the observer
at lorentz factors < gamma resulting in maximal apparent velocities smaller
than gamma}. Furthermore, getting rid of the homokinetic hypothesis yields a
complex relation between the observing angle and the Doppler factor, resulting
in important consequences for the numerical computation of AGN population and

practice of statistics. Any Bayesian inference depends on a likelihood and a
prior. Ideally one would like to elicit a prior from related sources of
information or past data. However, in its absence, Bayesian methods need to
rely on some ""objective"" or ""default"" priors, and the resulting posterior
inference can still be quite valuable. Not surprisingly, over the years, the
catalog of objective priors also has become prohibitively large, and one has to
set some specific criteria for the selection of such priors. Our aim is to
review some of these criteria, compare their performance, and illustrate them
with some simple examples. While for very large sample sizes, it does not
possibly matter what objective prior one uses, the selection of such a prior
does influence inference for small or moderate samples. For regular models
where asymptotic normality holds, Jeffreys' general rule prior, the positive
square root of the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, enjoys many
optimality properties in the absence of nuisance parameters. In the presence of
nuisance parameters, however, there are many other priors which emerge as
optimal depending on the criterion selected. One new feature in this article is
that a prior different from Jeffreys' is shown to be optimal under the
chi-square divergence criterion even in the absence of nuisance parameters. The
latter is also invariant under one-to-one reparameterization.

sample clusters are located in the halo of M31 and the most remote one is out
to a projected radius of 78.75 kpc from the galactic center. For all our sample
clusters, we measured the Lick absorption-line indices and the radial
velocities. It is noted that most GCs of our sample are distinct from the HI
rotation curve of M31 galaxy, especially for B514, MCGC5, H12 and B517,
suggesting that most of our sample clusters do not have kinematic association
with the star forming young disk of the galaxy. We fitted the absorption line
indices with the updated stellar population model Thomas et al. (2010) with two
different tracks of Cassisi and Padova, separately, by applying the
$\chi^2-$minimization method. The fitting results show that all our sample
clusters are older than 10 Gyr, and metal-poor ($-0.91 \le $ [Fe/H] $\le -2.38$
dex). After merging the spectroscopic metallicity of our work with the
previously published ones, we extended the cluster sample out to a projected
radius of 117 kpc from the galaxy's center. We found the metallicity gradient
for all the confirmed clusters exists with a slope of $-0.028\pm0.001$ dex
kpc$^{-1}$. However, the slope turns to be $-0.018\pm0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ for
all the halo clusters, which is much shallower. If we only consider the outer
halo clusters with $r_{\rm p}>25$ kpc, the slope becomes $-0.010\pm0.002$ dex
kpc$^{-1}$ and if one cluster G001 is excluded from the outer halo sample, the
slope is $-0.004\pm0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. Thus we conclude that metallicity
gradient for M31 outer halo clusters is not significant, which agrees well with
the previous findings.

which is a nonstandard situation. We use a recent construction for such
situations, developed by Grundling and Neeb. Once the field C*-algebra is
constructed for the fermions and gauge bosons, we define local and global gauge
transformations, and identify the Gauss law constraint. The full field algebra
is the crossed product of the previous one with the local gauge
transformations. The rest of the paper is concerned with enforcing the Gauss
law constraint to obtain the C*-algebra of quantum observables. For this, we
use the method of enforcing quantum constraints developed by Grundling and
Hurst. In particular, the natural inductive limit structure of the field
algebra is a central component of the analysis, and the constraint system
defined by the Gauss law constraint is a system of local constraints in the

solve the full constraint system by first solving the finite (local) systems

interstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies) project. Methods: We present the
12CO(1-0) data for 273 AMIGA galaxies. We constructed a redshift-limited sample
containing galaxies with 1500\kms <v<5000\kms and excluded objects with
morphological evidence of possible interaction. This sample ($n=173$) is the
basis for our statistical analysis. It is dominated, both in absolute number
and in detection rate, by galaxies of type T=3-5 (Sb-Sc). Most galaxies were
observed with a single pointing towards their centers. Therefore, we performed
an extrapolation to the total molecular gas mass expected in the entire disk
based on the assumption of an exponential distribution. We then studied the
relationships between \mhtwo\ and other galactic properties (\lb,\dopttwo,\lk,
\lfir, and \mhi). Results: We find correlations between \mhtwo\ and \lb,
\dopttwo, \lk, and \lfir. The tightest correlation of \mhtwo\ holds with \lfir\
and, for $T=3-5$, with \lk, and the poorest with \dopttwo. The correlations
with \lfir and \lk are very close to linearity. The correlation with \lb is
nonlinear so that \mhtwo/\lb\ increases with \lb. The molecular and the atomic
gas masses of our sample show no strong correlation. We find a low mean value,
log(\mhtwo/\mhi)=-0.7 (for $T=3-5$), and a strong decrease in this ratio with
morphological type. The molecular gas column density and the surface density of
the star formation rate (the Kennicutt-Schmidt law) show a tight correlation
with a rough unity slope. We compare the relations of \mhtwo\ with \lb and \lk
found for AMIGA galaxies to samples of interacting galaxies from the literature
and find an indication for an enhancement of the molecular gas in interacting
galaxies of up to 0.2-0.3 dex.

at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). Specifically, we address the
recent experimental observation of an elliptic flow of direct photons
comparable in magnitude to that of pions, which is at variance with
expectations based on quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dominated photon radiation. Our
thermal emission rate is based on previous work, i.e., resummed leading-order
QGP emission and in-medium hadronic rates in the confined phase. These rates
are nearly degenerate at temperatures close to the expected QCD-phase change.
The rates are convoluted over an improved elliptic-fireball expansion with
transverse- and elliptic-flow fields quantitatively constrained by empirical
light- and strange-hadron spectra. The resulting direct-photon spectra in
central Au-Au collisions are characterized by hadron-dominated emission up to
transverse momenta of ~2-3 GeV. The associated large elliptic flow in the
hadronic phase mitigates the discrepancy with the measured photon-v2 compared
to scenarios with QGP-dominated emission.

density or star formation (e.g. long GRB), we derive constraints arising from

smaller than a gyroradius, implying the escape time is very long, b) the

and charge densities of pulsar magnetospheres which do not obey the ideal

production of radiation requires the presence of an electric field component
parallel to the magnetic field, ${\bf E}_\parallel$, the structure of non-Ideal
pulsar magnetospheres is intimately related to the production of pulsar
radiation. Therefore, knowledge of the structure of non-Ideal pulsar
magnetospheres is important because their comparison (including models for the
production of radiation) with observations will delineate the physics and the
parameters underlying the pulsar radiation problem. We implement a variety of
prescriptions that support nonzero values for ${\bf E}_\parallel$ and explore
their effects on the structure of the resulting magnetospheres. We produce
families of solutions that span the entire range between the vacuum and the
(ideal) Force-Free Electrodynamic solutions. We also compute the amount of
dissipation as a fraction of the Poynting flux for pulsars of different angles
between the rotation and magnetic axes and conclude that this is at most 20-40%
(depending on the non-ideal prescription) in the aligned rotator and 10% in the
perpendicular one. We present also the limiting solutions with the property
$J=\rho c$ and discuss their possible implication on the determination of the
""on/off"" states of the intermittent pulsars. Finally, we find that solutions
with values of $J$ greater than those needed to null ${\bf E}_\parallel$

us to properly study the intrinsic continuum emission from M82 X-1. The

than uniform, we have local uniqueness and asymptotic normality with a rate of
1 / \surdn. With increased proximity to the uniform distribution the rate can
be arbitrarly slow, and in the limit, local uniqueness is lost. Further, we
give general distributional conditions, e.g. unimodality, that ensure global
uniqueness. Along the way, we discover that sample means can occur only at the
vertices of a regular polygon which allows to compute intrinsic sample means in
linear time from sorted data. This algorithm is finally applied in a simulation
study demonstrating the dependence of the convergence rates on the behavior of

agreement and discrepancies with different published data based on deep

because data derived from the scattering experiments predict in water two
maxima of K_H around 270 K and 277 K, and that K_H is lower in ice than in

the heat capacity of water and ice at constant pressure, and the isotopic shift
in the melting temperature of ice upon isotopic substitution of either H or O

cooperative relayed transmission from fixed indoor nodes to a common outdoor
access point. A stochastic bivariate model for the spatial distribution of the
fading parameters that govern the link performance, namely the Rician K-factor
and the path-loss, is proposed and validated by means of real channel
measurements. The partner selection protocol is based on the real-time
estimation of a function of these fading parameters, i.e., the coding gain. To
reduce the complexity of the link quality assessment, a Bayesian approach is
proposed that uses the site-specific bivariate model as a-priori information
for the coding gain estimation. This link quality estimator allows network
lifetime gains almost as if all K-factor values were known. Furthermore, it
suits IEEE 802.15.4 compliant networks as it efficiently exploits the
information acquired from the receiver signal strength indicator. Extensive
numerical results highlight the trade-off between complexity, robustness to
model mismatches and network lifetime performance. We show for instance that
infrequent updates of the site-specific model through K-factor estimation over
a subset of links are sufficient to at least double the network lifetime with
respect to existing algorithms based on path loss information only.

heightened interest among researchers, educators and policy makers in using
these data to evaluate educational inputs, as well as for school and possibly
teacher accountability. Researchers have developed elaborate ""value-added
models"" of these longitudinal data to estimate the effects of educational
inputs (e.g., teachers or schools) on student achievement while using prior
achievement to adjust for nonrandom assignment of students to schools and
classes. A challenge to such modeling efforts is the extensive numbers of
students with incomplete records and the tendency for those students to be
lower achieving. These conditions create the potential for results to be
sensitive to violations of the assumption that data are missing at random,
which is commonly used when estimating model parameters. The current study
extends recent value-added modeling approaches for longitudinal student
achievement data Lockwood et al. [J. Educ. Behav. Statist. 32 (2007) 125--150]
to allow data to be missing not at random via random effects selection and
pattern mixture models, and applies those methods to data from a large urban
school district to estimate effects of elementary school mathematics teachers.
We find that allowing the data to be missing not at random has little impact on
estimated teacher effects. The robustness of estimated teacher effects to the
missing data assumptions appears to result from both the relatively small
impact of model specification on estimated student effects compared with the
large variability in teacher effects and the downweighting of scores from
students with incomplete data.

the nuclei of active galaxies and used to precisely determine the mass of their
host black holes. We show that there is an empirical linear correlation between
the disk radius and the black hole mass. We demonstrate that such disks are
naturally formed by the partial capture of molecular clouds passing through the
galactic nucleus and temporarily engulfing the central supermassive black hole.
Imperfect cancellation of the angular momenta of the cloud material colliding
after passing on opposite sides of the hole leads to the formation of a compact
disk. The radial extent of the disk is determined by the efficiency of this
process and the Bondi-Hoyle capture radius of the black hole, and naturally
produces the empirical linear correlation of the radial extent of the maser
distribution with black hole mass. The disk has sufficient column density to
allow X-ray irradiation from the central source to generate physical and
chemical conditions conducive to the formation of 22 GHz H2O masers. For

and with the magnetic field parallel to the crystal c-axis, undergoes a
sequence of transitions between different structures as a function of applied
magnetic field. However, from structural studies alone, it is not possible to
determine precisely the system anisotropy that governs the transitions between
different structures. To address this question, here we report new small-angle
neutron scattering measurements of both the VL structure at higher
temperatures, and the field- and temperature-dependence of the VL form factor.
Our measurements demonstrate how the influence of anisotropy on the VL, which
in theory can be parameterized as nonlocal corrections, becomes progressively
important with increasing magnetic field, and suppressed by increasing the
temperature towards Tc. The data indicate that nonlocality due to different
anisotropies play important roles in determining the VL properties.

state transitions between the low/hard state and the high/soft state. We select
all observations within a certain hardness ratio range during the soft
intermediate state (SIMS). This sample was chosen in such a way to comprise all
observations that show a type-B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). In addition,
we also investigate the spectra of hard intermediate state observations. The
spectra, obtained from Proportional Counter Array data in the 10 to 40 keV
range, are fitted with a power law and an additional high energy cut-off if
needed. We find that the spectra are significantly harder during the SIMS of
the soft-to-hard transition than they are during the hard-to-soft transition.
This demonstrates that during the SIMS of the soft-to-hard transition not only
the luminosity and peak frequencies of type-B QPOs are lower, but that also the
photon index is lower, compared to the hard-to-soft transition. Hence, type-B
QPOs can be associated to a different spectral shape even though they appear at
the same hardness. However, in each branch only certain combinations of
centroid frequency and photon index are realised.

spherical cluster model to simplify the analysis, but some recent studies have
suggested this simplifying assumption may result in large biases in estimated
cluster masses and concentration values, since clusters are expected to exhibit
triaxiality. Several such analyses have, however, quoted expressions for the
spatial derivatives of the lensing potential in triaxial models, which are open
to misinterpretation. In this paper, we give a clear description of weak
lensing by triaxial NFW galaxy clusters and also present an efficient and
robust method to model these clusters and obtain parameter estimates. By
considering four highly triaxial NFW galaxy clusters, we re-examine the impact
of simplifying spherical assumptions and found that while the concentration
estimates are largely unbiased except in one of our traixial NFW simulated
clusters, for which the concentration is only slightly biased, the masses are
significantly biased, by up to 40%, for all the clusters we analysed. Moreover,
we find that such assumptions can lead to the erroneous conclusion that some
substructure is present in the galaxy clusters or, even worse, that multiple
galaxy clusters are present in the field. Our cluster fitting method also
allows one to answer the question of whether a given cluster exhibits
triaxiality or a simple spherical model is good enough.

periodic Abrikosov vortex lattice in a type-II superconductor. We investigate
electromagnetic behavior of vacuum in this state. Since superconductivity is
realized along the axis of magnetic field only, strong anisotropy of the vacuum
dielectric tensor is observed. The diagonal components of the tensor are
positive in the x and y directions perpendicular to the magnetic field, and
negative in the z direction along the field. As a result, vacuum behaves as a
hyperbolic metamaterial medium. If the magnetic field is constant, low
frequency extraordinary photons experience this medium as a (3+1) Minkowski
spacetime in which the role of time is played by the spatial z coordinate.
Spatial variations of the magnetic field curve this effective spacetime, and
may lead to formation of ""event horizons"", which are analogous to
electromagnetic black holes in hyperbolic metamaterials. We also note that
hyperbolic metamaterials behave as diffractionless ""perfect lenses"". Since
large enough magnetic fields probably had arisen in the course of evolution of
early Universe, the demonstrated hyperbolic behavior of early vacuum may have
imprints in the large scale structure of the present-day Universe.

Poisson spaces. Specifically, it seeks to understand when a singular symplectic
quotient V/G of a symplectic vector space V by a group G \subseteq Sp_2n(R) is
realizable as a Poisson subspace of some Poisson manifold (R^n,{.,.}).
  The local embedding problem is recast in the language of schemes and
reinterpreted as a problem of extending the Poisson bracket to infinitesimal
neighborhoods of an embedded singular space. Such extensions of a Poisson
bracket near a singular point p of V/G are then related to the cohomology and
representation theory of the cotangent Lie algebra at p.
  Using this framework, it is shown that the real 4-dimensional quotient
V/\ZZ_n (n odd) is not realizable as a Poisson subspace of any
(R^{2n+6},{.,.}), even though the underlying variety algebraically embeds into
R^{2n+6}. The proof of this nonembedding result hinges on a refinement of the
Levi decomposition for Poisson manifolds to partially linearize any extension
with respect to the Levi decomposition of the cotangent Lie algebra of V/G at
the origin. Moreover, in the case n=3, this nonembedding result is complemented
by a concrete realization of V/\ZZ_3 as a Poisson subspace of R^78.

show that the system does not polarize unless charged defects or adsorbates

bound charge generated on its surface by redox processes when poling the film.
This, in turn, alters the band alignment at the bottom electrode interface,
explaining the observed tunneling electroresistance. Our conclusions are
supported by energetics calculated for varied electrochemical scenarios.

$F:dom(F)\to\bar R^F$ defined on the dense $G_\delta$-set $dom(F)=\bigcap_{f\in

$\Gamma(F)=\{(x,f(x)):x\in dom(F)\}$ in $\bar R^2\times\bar R^F$ is called the
{\em graphoid} of the family $F$. We prove the graphoid $\bar\Gamma(F)$ has
topological dimension $dim(\bar\Gamma(F))=2$. If the family $F$ contains all
linear fractional transformations $f(x,y)=\frac{x-a}{y-b}$ for $(a,b)\in Q^2$,
then the graphoid $\bar\Gamma(F)$ has cohomological dimension
$dim_G(\bar\Gamma(F))=1$ for any non-trivial 2-divisible abelian group $G$.
Hence the space $\bar\Gamma(F)$ is a natural example of a compact space that is
