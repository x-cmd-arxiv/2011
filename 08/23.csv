giants. This model follows the energy flux of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence
from a subsurface convection zone to its eventual dissipation and escape
through open magnetic flux tubes. We show how Alfven waves and turbulence can
produce winds in either a hot corona or a cool extended chromosphere, and we
specify the conditions that determine whether or not coronal heating occurs.
These models do not utilize arbitrary normalization factors, but instead
predict the mass loss rate directly from a star's fundamental properties. We
take account of stellar magnetic activity by extending standard
age-activity-rotation indicators to include the evolution of the filling factor
of strong photospheric magnetic fields. We compared the predicted mass loss
rates with observed values for 47 stars and found significantly better
agreement than was obtained from the popular scaling laws of Reimers,
Schroeder, and Cuntz. The algorithm used to compute cool-star mass loss rates

gravity theories like Brans-Dicke, Ho$\check{\text r}$ava-Lifshitz and $f(R)$
gravities. We have considered the universe filled with dark matter and dark

closed and flat models. We have observed that in all cases the equation of
state behaves like quintessence. The temperature and heat capacity of the
universe are found to decrease with the expansion of the universe in all cases.
In Brans-Dicke and $f(R)$ gravity theories the squared speed of sound is found
to exhibit increasing behavior for open, closed and flat models and in
Ho$\check{\text r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity theory it is found to exhibit
decreasing behavior for open and closed models with the evolution of the

constant in Ho$\check{\text r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity.

the class of linear functions. We improve the best known bound in this setting
from $(1.39+o(1))en\ln n$ to $en\ln n+O(n)$ in expectation and with high
probability, which is tight up to lower-order terms. Moreover, upper and lower
bounds for arbitrary mutations probabilities $p$ are derived, which imply
expected polynomial optimization time as long as $p=O((\ln n)/n)$ and which are
tight if $p=c/n$ for a constant $c$. As a consequence, the standard mutation
probability $p=1/n$ is optimal for all linear functions, and the (1+1) EA is
found to be an optimal mutation-based algorithm. The proofs are based on
adaptive drift functions and the recent multiplicative drift theorem.

be explained by core-collapse supernovae, as is commonly assumed for their
counterparts in the Galactic disk. We apply a Bayesian analysis to the results
from surveys for radio pulsars in globular clusters and find the number of
potentially observable non-recycled radio pulsars present in all clusters to be
< 3600. Accounting for beaming and retention considerations, the implied birth
rate for any formation scenario for all 97 clusters is < 0.25 pulsars per
century assuming a Maxwellian distribution of velocities with a dispersion of
10 km s^{-1}. The implied birth rates for higher velocity dispersions are
substantially higher than inferred for such pulsars in the Galactic disk. This
suggests that the velocity dispersion of young pulsars in globular clusters is
significantly lower than those of disk pulsars. These numbers may be
substantial overestimates due to the fact that the currently known sample of
young pulsars is observed only in metal-rich clusters. We propose that young
pulsars may only be formed in globular clusters with metallicities with
log[Fe/H] > -0.6. In this case, the potentially observable population of such
young pulsars is 447^{+1420}_{-399} (the error bars give the 95% confidence

makes an explicit use of the regularity of $F$ in the forward step, and the

conduct an ongoing monitoring campaign with the Swift X-ray Telescope and found
that HLX-1 showed two fast rise and exponential decay with increases in the
count rate of a factor ~40 separated by 375+/-13 days. We obtained new
XMM-Newton and Chandra dedicated pointings that were triggered at the lowest
and highest luminosities, respectively. The unabsorbed luminosities ranged from
1.9x10^40 to 1.25x10^42 erg/s. We confirm here the detection of spectral state
transitions from HLX-1 reminiscent of Galactic black hole binaries: at high
luminosities, the X-ray spectrum showed a thermal state dominated by a disk
component with temperatures of 0.26 keV at most, and at low luminosities the
spectrum is dominated by a hard power law with a photon index in the range
1.4-2.1, consistent with a hard state. The source was also observed in a steep
power law state. In the thermal state, the luminosity of the disk component
appears to scale with the fourth power of the inner disk temperature which
supports the presence of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk.
The low fractional variability (rms of 9+/-9%) in this state also suggests the
presence of a dominant disk. The spectral changes and long-term variability of
the source cannot be explained by variations of the beaming angle and are not
consistent with the source being in a super-Eddington accretion state. HLX-1 is
thus an unusual ULX as it is similar to Galactic black hole binaries, which
have non-beamed and sub-Eddington emission, but with luminosities 3 orders of
magnitude higher. In this picture, a lower limit on the mass of the black hole
of >9000 M_sun can be derived, and the disk temperature in the thermal state
also suggests the presence of a black hole of a few 10^3 M_sun.

of galaxy mergers compiled from the SDSS. 95% of TD-producing mergers involve
two spiral progenitors, while most remaining systems have at least one spiral
progenitor. The fraction of TD-producing mergers where both parents are
early-type galaxies is <2%, suggesting that TDs are unlikely to form in such
mergers. The bulk of TD-producing systems inhabit a field environment and have
mass ratios greater than 1:7 (the median value is 1:2.5). TDs forming at the
tidal-tail tips are ~4 times more massive than those forming at the base of the
tails. TDs have stellar masses that are less than 10% of the stellar masses of
their parents and typically lie within 15 optical half-light radii of their
parent galaxies. The TD population is typically bluer than the parents, with a
median offset of ~0.3 mag in the (g-r) colour and the TD colours are not
affected by the presence of AGN activity in their parents. An analysis of their
star formation histories indicates that TDs contain both newly formed stars
(with a median age of ~30 Myr) and old stars drawn from the parent disks, each
component probably contributing roughly equally to their stellar mass. Thus,
TDs are not formed purely through gas condensation in tidal tails but host a
significant component of old stars from the parent disks. Finally, an analysis
of the TD contribution to the local dwarf-to-massive galaxy ratio indicates
that ~6% of dwarfs in nearby clusters may have a tidal origin, if TD production
rates in nearby mergers are representative of those in the high-redshift
Universe. Even if TD production rates at high redshift were several factors
higher, it seems unlikely that the entire dwarf galaxy population today is a
result of merger activity over the lifetime of the Universe.

galaxy, or galaxy cluster, to become gravitationally unstable. The subsequent
collapse of this gas on a dynamical timescale can provide an abundant source of
fuel for AGN heating and star formation. Thus, this mechanism provides a way to
link the AGN accretion rate to the global properties of an ambient cooling
flow, but without the implicit assumption that the accreted material must have
flowed onto the black hole from 10s of kiloparsecs away. It is shown that a
fuelling mechanism of this sort naturally leads to a close balance between AGN
heating and the radiative cooling rate of the hot, X-ray emitting halo.
Furthermore, AGN powered by cooling-induced gravitational instability would
exhibit characteristic duty cycles (delta) which are redolent of recent
observational findings: delta is proportional to L_X/sigma_{*}^{3}, where L_X
is the X-ray luminosity of the hot atmosphere, and sigma_{*} is the central
stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. Combining this result with
well-known scaling relations, we deduce a duty cycle for radio AGN in
elliptical galaxies that is approximately proportional to M_{BH}^{1.5}, where
M_{BH} is the central black hole mass. Outburst durations and Eddington ratios

motion in the internal space. The dilaton is considered as a spectator field
which modulates the evolution of the vector field. In this set up, the vector
curvaton is able to generate measurable statistical anisotropy in the spectrum
and bispectrum of the curvature perturbation assuming that the dilaton evolves
as e^(-\phi)\propto a^2 where a(t) is the scale factor. Our work constitutes a
first step towards exploring how such distinctive features may arise from the
presence of several light fields that naturally appear in string theory models
of cosmology.

definitely be ruled out to host an IMBH. The measured r_c/r_h ratio has similar
values for clusters that have not undergone core-collapse, and those containing

magnetized gas sloshing in galaxy clusters initiated by encounters with

magnetized intracluster medium by simulating their formation in realistic,
idealized mergers with high resolution ({\Delta}x ~ 2 kpc). Our simulations
sample a parameter space of plausible initial magnetic field strengths and
field configurations. In the simulations, we observe strong velocity shears
associated with the cold fronts amplifying the magnetic field along the cold
front surfaces, increasing the magnetic field strength in these layers by up to
an order of magnitude, and boosting the magnetic pressure up to
near-equipartition with thermal pressure in some cases. In these layers, the
magnetic field becomes strong enough to stabilize the cold fronts against
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, resulting in sharp, smooth fronts as those seen
in observations of real clusters. These magnetic fields also result in strong
suppression of mixing of high and low-entropy gas in the cluster, seen in our
simulations of mergers in the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, the
heating of the core due to sloshing is very modest and is unable to stave off a
cooling catastrophe.

when problems are single-dimensional, and disciplinary boundaries are open, all
workers will specialize. However, when there are barriers to working on

specialist and the wider scope of problems the generalist has available. When
problems are simple, having a wide variety of problems makes it is rational to
be a generalist. As these problems become more difficult, though, depth wins
out over scope, and workers again tend to specialize. However, that decision is
not necessarily socially optimal--on a societal level, we would prefer that

heavier elements results in a radial composition profile which is stabilizing
against buoyant acceleration, with light material residing above heavier
material. However, under some circumstances, such as off-center ignition, the
composition profile resulting from nuclear burning can be destabilizing, and
characterized by an outwardly increasing mean molecular weight. The potential
for instabilities under these circumstances, and the consequences that they may
have on stellar structural evolution, remain largely unexplored. In this paper
we study the development and evolution of instabilities associated with
unstable composition gradients in regions which are initially stable according
to linear Schwarzschild and Ledoux criteria. In particular, we explore the
mixing taking place under various conditions with multi-dimensional
hydrodynamic convection models based on stellar evolutionary calculations of
the core helium flash in a 1.25 \Msun star, the core carbon flash in a
9.3\,\Msun star, and of oxygen shell burning in a star with a mass of
23\,\Msun. The results of our simulations reveal a mixing process associated
with regions having outwardly increasing mean molecular weight that reside
below convection zones. The mixing is not due to overshooting from the
convection zone, nor is it due directly to thermohaline mixing which operates
on a timescale several orders of magnitude larger than the simulated flows.
Instead, the mixing appears to be due to the presence of a wave field induced
in the stable layers residing beneath the convection zone which enhances the
mixing rate by many orders of magnitude and allows a thermohaline type mixing
process to operate on a dynamical, rather than thermal, timescale. We discuss
our results in terms of related laboratory phenomena and associated theoretical
developments.

extend out to a radius r$\sim$40 kpc and show that the abundance profiles of
Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Ne, Mg, and Ni are all centrally peaked. Interestingly, the
abundance profiles of Si and S - which are measured robustly and to high
precision - are even more centrally peaked than Fe, while the Si/S ratio is
relatively flat. These measurements challenge the standard picture of chemical
enrichment in galaxy clusters, wherein type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) from an
evolved stellar population are thought to dominate the central enrichment. The
observed abundance patterns are most likely due to one or more of the following
processes: continuing enrichment by winds of a stellar population pre-enriched
by SNCC products; intermittent formation of massive stars in the central
cooling core; early enrichment of the low entropy gas. We also discuss other
processes that might have contributed to the observed radial profiles, such as
a stellar initial mass function that changes with radius; changes in the
pre-enrichment of core-collapse supernova progenitors; and a diversity in the
elemental yields of SN Ia. Although systematic uncertainties prevent us from
measuring the O abundance robustly, indications are that it is about 2 times
lower than predicted by the enrichment models.

from the insight that in order to understand and design intelligent behavior,
we must adopt an embodied perspective, i.e. we must take the entire agent,
including its shape or morphology, the materials out of which it is built, and
its interaction with the environment into account, in addition to the neural

sensory-motor tasks such as locomotion (e.g. walking, running, jumping),
navigation, and grasping. While this research is of interest in itself, in the
context of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, this leads to the
question of what these kinds of tasks have to do with higher levels of
cognition, or to put it more provocatively, ""What does walking have to do with
thinking?"" This question is of course reminiscent of the notorious ""symbol
grounding problem"". In contrast to most of the research on symbol grounding, we
propose to exploit the dynamic interaction between the embodied agent and the
environment as the basis for grounding. We use the term ""morphological
computation"" to designate the fact that some of the control or computation can
be taken over by the dynamic interaction derived from morphological properties
(e.g. the passive forward swing of the leg in walking, the spring-like
properties of the muscles, and the weight distribution). By taking
morphological computation into account, an agent will be able to achieve not
only faster, more robust, and more energy-efficient behavior, but also more
situated exploration by the agent for the comprehensive understanding of the

continuum field characterization of nonperiodic and localized textures. The
phenomenological functional is based on the pairwise direction-dependent
interaction of field gradients that are separated by a fixed distance. In an
appendix, we describe the numerical minimization of our functional. On that
basis, we investigate the kinetic evolution of thread-like stripe patterns that
are created by the functional when we start from an initially disordered state.
At later stages, we find a coarse-graining that shows the same scaling behavior
as was obtained for the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In fact, the Cahn-Hilliard
model is contained in our characterization as a limiting case. A slight
modification of our model omits this coarse-graining and leads to nonperiodic
stripe phases. For the latter case, we investigate the temporal evolution of
the defects (end points) of the thread-like stripes. In view of possible
applications of this functional, we discuss a possible characterization of
polymeric systems and vesicles. The statistics of the growth of the thread-like
structures is compared to the case of step-growth polymerization reactions.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the functional may be applied for the study of
vesicles in a continuum field description. Basic features, such as the tendency
of tank-treading in simple shear flows and parachute folding in pipe flows, are
reproduced.

used for the design of a magnetic linear actuator with applications to
fin-based locomotion. Most of the current robotic fish generate bending motion
using rotary motors which implies at least one mechanical conversion of the
motion. We seek a solution that directly bends the fin and, at the same time,
is able to exploit the magneto-mechanical properties of the fin material. This
strong fin-actuator coupling blends the actuator and the body of the robot,
allowing cross optimization of the system's elements.
  We study a simplified model of an elastic element, a spring-mass system
representing a flexible fin, subjected to nonlinear forcing, emulating magnetic
interaction. The dynamics of the system is studied under unforced and periodic
forcing conditions. The analysis is focused on the limit cycles present in the
system, which allows the periodic bending of the fin and the generation of
thrust. The frequency, maximum amplitude and center of the periodic orbits
(offset of the bending) depend directly on the stiffness of the fin and the
intensity of the forcing; we use this dependency to sketch a simple parameter
controller. Although the model is strongly simplified, it provides means to
estimate first values of the parameters for this kind of actuator and it is
useful to evaluate the feasibility of minimal actuation control of such
systems.

  Renormalization group (RG) techniques offer great potential for theoretical
advances in both hot and dense QCD as well as many-body physics, but their

further step to bridge this gap. A cross-fertilization is indeed promising
since it may eventually provide us with an ab-initio description of
hadronization, condensation, and bound-state formation in strongly interacting
theories. After giving a thorough introduction to the derivation and analysis
of fermionic RG flows, we give an introductory review of our present
understanding of universal long-range behavior in various different theories,
ranging from non-relativistic many-body problems to relativistic gauge
theories, with an emphasis on scaling behavior of physical observables close to
quantum phase transitions (i. e. phase transitions at zero temperature) as well

trace the dust continuum emission and the N2H+ (J=1-0) and CH3CN (J=5-4)

each MDC. These velocity components reveal local shears in the velocity fields
which are best interpreted as convergent flows. Moreover, we report the
detection of weak extended emission from CH3CN at the position of the N2H+
velocity shears. We propose that this extended CH3CN emission is tracing warm
gas associated with the low-velocity shocks expected at the location of
convergence of the flows where velocity shears are observed. This is the first
detection of low-velocity shocks associated with small (sub-parsec) scale
convergent flows which are proposed to be at the origin of the densest
structures and of the formation of (high-mass) stars. In addition, we propose
that MDCs may be active sites of star-formation for more than a crossing time
as they continuously receive material from larger scale flows as suggested by
the global picture of dynamical, gravity driven evolution of massive clumps
which is favored by the present observations.

metals. We calculate the electron-phonon matrix elements including the
spin-orbit interaction in the electronic wave functions and the interaction
potential. Using the matrix elements in Boltzmann scattering integrals, the
momentum-resolved carrier distributions are obtained by solving their equation
of motion numerically. We find that the optical excitation with realistic laser
intensities alone leads to a negligible magnetization change, and that the
demagnetization due to electron-phonon interaction is mostly due to hole
scattering. Importantly, the calculated demagnetization quenching due to this
Elliot-Yafet type depolarization mechanism is not large enough to explain the
experimentally observed result. We argue that the ultrafast demagnetization of
ferromagnets does not occur exclusively via an Elliott-Yafet type process,
i.e., scattering in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction, but is
influenced to a large degree by a dynamical change of the band structure, i.e.,
the exchange splitting.

do with the micro-level uncertainty. Besides, the sensitive dependence on
initial condition (SDIC) of Lorenz chaos has never been considered together
with the so-called continuum-assumption of fluid (on which Lorenz equations are
based), from physical and statistic viewpoints. A very fine numerical technique
(Liao, 2009) with negligible truncation and round-off errors, called here the
""clean numerical simulation"" (CNS), is applied to investigate the propagation
of the micro-level unavoidable uncertain fluctuation (caused by the
continuum-assumption of fluid) of initial conditions for Lorenz equation with
chaotic solutions. Our statistic analysis based on CNS computation of 10,000
samples shows that, due to the SDIC, the uncertainty of the micro-level
statistic fluctuation of initial conditions transfers into the macroscopic
randomness of chaos. This suggests that chaos might be a bridge from
micro-level uncertainty to macroscopic randomness, and thus would be an origin
of macroscopic randomness. We reveal in this article that, due to the SDIC of
chaos and the inherent uncertainty of initial data, accurate long-term
prediction of chaotic solution is not only impossible in mathematics but also
has no physical meanings. This might provide us a new, different viewpoint to
deepen and enrich our understandings about the SDIC of chaos.

on the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system
utility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted geometric mean rate, and the
weighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and
individual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a
complicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem
and make the optimization problem difficult to handle. {Although} this
nonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner,
this brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of
transmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of
transmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are
necessary. The focus of this paper is hence on the design of such efficient
approximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient
successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality
approximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex
approximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a
stationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming
design problem. {Furthermore}, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where
each transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information
obtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its
distributed counterpart indeed converge, and near-optimal performance can be
achieved for all the considered system utilities.

sets of a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. The algorithm can be used to
estimate the error floor of LDPC codes or to be part of the apparatus to design
LDPC codes with low error floors. For regular codes, the algorithm is initiated
with a set of short cycles as the input. For irregular codes, in addition to
short cycles, variable nodes with low degree and cycles with low approximate
cycle extrinsic message degree (ACE) are also used as the initial inputs. The
initial inputs are then expanded recursively to dominant trapping sets of
increasing size. At the core of the algorithm lies the analysis of the
graphical structure of dominant trapping sets and the relationship of such

The algorithm is universal in the sense that it can be used for an arbitrary

absorbing sets and Zyablov-Pinsker (ZP) trapping sets, known to dominate the
performance of LDPC codes in the error floor region over different channels and
for different iterative decoding algorithms. Simulation results on several LDPC
codes demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In

resulting from the many-body effect of interacting electrons and is of vast
interest in fundamental physics. The experimental observation of topological
surface states (SSs) in three-dimensional bulk solids has allowed the study of
a correlated chiral Dirac fermion system, which can host a single Dirac valley
without spin degeneracy. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) might be observable in topological insulators.
However, due to the dominant bulk conduction it is difficult to probe the
strong correlation effect in topological insulators from resistivity
measurements. Here we report the discovery of FQH states in Bi2Te3 from
thermopower measurements. The surface thermopower is ten times greater than
that of bulk, which makes possible the observation of fractional-filled Landau
levels in SSs. Thermopower hence provides a powerful tool to investigate
correlated Dirac fermions in topological insulators. Our observations
demonstrate that Dirac topological SSs exhibit strongly correlated phases in a
high magnetic field, and would enable studies of a variety of exotic fractional
quantum Hall physics and other correlated phenomena in this newly discovered
chiral Dirac system.

Previous approaches proved the existence of infinitely many such sets given the

develop a new, explicit construction for one such set, and then extend to a
positive percentage of sets.
  We extend these results further, finding sets that exhibit different behavior

that for any $m$, $|\epsilon_1A + ... + \epsilon_kA| - |\delta_1A + ... +

Numerical searches were unable to find even a 2-generational set (heuristics
indicate the probability is at most $10^{-9}$, and almost surely significantly

Since the first stars are expected to form anisotropic ionization fronts in the
surrounding clumpy media, magnetic fields are generated by effects of radiation
force as well as the Biermann battery effect. We have calculated the amplitude
of magnetic field generated by the effects of radiation force around the first
stars in the preceding paper, in which the Biermann battery effects are not
taken into account.In this paper, we calculate the generation of magnetic
fields by the Biermann battery effect as well as the effects of radiation
force, utilizing the radiation hydrodynamics simulations. As a result, we find
that the generated magnetic field strengths are ~ 10^{-19}G-10^{-17}G at ~
100pc-1kpc scale mainly by the Biermann battery, which is an order of magnitude
larger than the results of our previous study. We also find that this result is
insensitive to various physical parameters including the mass of the source
star, distance between the source and the dense clump, unless we take unlikely
values of these parameters.

of the high stellar density in star forming regions, while formation by capture
in the Galactic field is highly improbable. We propose that these binary
systems were formed during the dissolution phase of star clusters (see
Kouwenhoven et al. 2010, for details). Stars escaping from a dissolving star
cluster can have very similar velocities, which can lead to the formation of a
wide binary systems. We carry out N-body simulations to test this hypothesis.
The results indicate that this mechanism explains the origin of wide binary
systems in the Galaxy. The resulting wide binary fraction and semi-major axis
distribution depend on the initial conditions of the dissolving star cluster,
while the distributions in eccentricity and mass ratio are universal. Finally,
since most stars are formed in (relatively tight) primordial binaries, we
predict that a large fraction of the wide ""binary stars"" are in fact

the ranking mechanisms into the query processing methods and makes two
improvements to support efficient top-$k$ keyword search in relational

in computing the top-$k$ results in a static database and in maintaining the
top-$k$ results when the database continually being updated. Experimental

Firstly, we present a dynamical system analysis of a general $f(R)$-DGP model.
We show that in the phase space of the model, there exist three standard
critical points; one of which is a de Sitter point corresponding to
accelerating phase of the universe expansion. The stability of this point
depends on the effective equation of state parameter of the curvature fluid. If
we consider the curvature fluid to be a canonical scalar field in the
equivalent scalar-tensor theory, the mentioned de Sitter phase is unstable,
otherwise it is an attractor, stable phase. We show that the effective equation
of state parameter of the model realizes an effective phantom-like behavior. A

phase in its expansion history, is a cosmologically viable scenario.

stars, it has been found that the chemical composition of the Sun seems to
depart systematically from those of the twins. One possible explanation is that
the effect is due to the special aspect angle of the Sun when observed from
Earth, as compared with the aspect angles of the twins. Thus, a latitude
dependence of the solar spectrum, even with the heliocentric angle constant,
could lead to effects of the type observed.
  Aim: We explore a possible variation in the strength of certain spectral
lines, used in the comparisons between the composition of the Sun and the
twins, at loci on the solar disk with different latitudes but at constant
heliocentric angle.
  Methods: We use the TRIPPEL spectrograph at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope
on La Palma to record spectra in five spectral regions in order to compare
different locations on the solar disk at a heliocentric angle of 45 deg.
Equivalent widths and other parameters are measured for fifteen different lines
representing nine atomic species.
  Results: The relative variations in equivalent widths at the equator and at
solar latitude 45 deg are found to be less than 1.5 % for all spectral lines
studied. Translated to elemental abundances as they would be measured from a
terrestrial and a hypothetical pole-on observer, the difference is estimated to
be within 0.005 dex in all cases.
  Conclusion: It is very unlikely that latitude effects could cause the
reported abundance difference between the Sun and the solar twins. The accuracy
obtainable in measurements of small differences in spectral line strengths
between different solar disk positions is very high.

similarly as a source or a sink for the mean energy transfer rate. When
isotropy is assumed, compressible turbulence may be described by the relation,
$- {2 \over 3} \epsilon_{\rm{eff}} r = {\cal F}_r(r)$, where ${\cal F}_r$ is

solve various optimization problems. The question of how the performance of a
population-based EA depends on the population size arises naturally. The
performance of an EA may be evaluated by different measures, such as the
average convergence rate to the optimal set per generation or the expected
number of generations to encounter an optimal solution for the first time.
Population scalability is the performance ratio between a benchmark EA and
another EA using identical genetic operators but a larger population size.
Although intuitively the performance of an EA may improve if its population
size increases, currently there exist only a few case studies for simple
fitness functions. This paper aims at providing a general study for discrete
optimisation. A novel approach is introduced to analyse population scalability
using the fundamental matrix. The following two contributions summarize the
major results of the current article. (1) We demonstrate rigorously that for
elitist EAs with identical global mutation, using a lager population size
always increases the average rate of convergence to the optimal set; and yet,
sometimes, the expected number of generations needed to find an optimal
solution (measured by either the maximal value or the average value) may
increase, rather than decrease. (2) We establish sufficient and/or necessary
conditions for the superlinear scalability, that is, when the average
convergence rate of a $(\mu+\mu)$ EA (where $\mu\ge2$) is bigger than $\mu$
times that of a $(1+1)$ EA.

presents an exact, variational nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory for fully

calculations as a lowest order approximation to an exact nonequilibrium
thermodynamics density functional evaluation. The theory starts from the
complete electron nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics and I identify
the operator for the nonequilibrium Gibbs free energy. I demonstrate a minimal
property of a functional for the nonequilibrium thermodynamic grand potential
which thus uniquely identifies the solution as the exact nonequilibrium density
matrix. I also show that a uniqueness-of-density proof from a closely related
study [Phys. Rev. B 78, 165109 (2008)] makes it possible to provide a
single-particle formulation based on universal electron-density functionals. I
illustrate a formal evaluation of the thermodynamics grand potential value
which is closely related to the variation in scattering phase shifts and hence
to Friedel density oscillations. This paper also discusses the difference
between the here-presented exact thermodynamics forces and the often-used
electrostatic forces. Finally the paper documents an inherent adiabatic nature
of the thermodynamics forces and observes that these are suited for a
nonequilibrium implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

magnetic candidate stars. We quantify UV wind line variability, and analyse its
time behaviour. The B1/B2V star sigma Lup emerged as a new magnetic candidate
star. AAT spectropolarimetric measurements with SEMPOL were obtained.
  The stellar wind line variations of sigma Lup are similar to what is known in
magnetic B stars, but no periodicity could be determined. We detected a
longitudinal magnetic field with varying strength and amplitude of about 100 G
with error bars of typically 20 G, which supports an oblique magnetic-rotator
configuration. The equivalent width variations of the UV lines, the magnetic
and the optical line variations are consistent with the well-known photometric
period of 3.02 days, which we identify with the rotation period of the star.
Additional observations with ESPaDOnS at CFHT strongly confirmed this
discovery, and allowed to determine a precise magnetic period. Further analysis
revealed that $\sigma$ Lupi is a helium-strong star, with an enhanced nitrogen
abundance and an underabundance of carbon, and has a spotted surface.
  We conclude that sigma Lup is a magnetic oblique rotator, and is a He-strong
star. It is the 4th B star for which a magnetic field is discovered from
studying only its wind variability. Like in the other magnetic B stars the wind
emission originates in the magnetic equator, with maximum emission occurring
when a magnetic pole points towards the Earth. The 3.02 d magnetic rotation
period is consistent with the photometric period, with maximum light
corresponding to maximum magnetic field. A full paper will be submitted to A&A.

Scatter Peak. The essence of the method is the valuation of the local scatter

ground-based millimagnitude photometry with 3-min cadence, and the expected
data quality of the planned ESA mission of PLATO. The method requires ~100
transit observations, therefore applicable for moons of 10-20 day period

turned out to be quite promising even for the simulated ground-based
observations, while the detection limit of the expected PLATO data is around
0.4 R_Earth. We give practical suggestions for observations and data reduction
to improve the chance of such a detection: (i) transit observations must
include out-of-transit phases before and after a transit, spanning at least the
same duration as the transit itself; (ii) any trend filtering must be done in
such a way that the preceding and following out-of-transit phases remain
unaffected.

the size of hot spots is much smaller then the size of the polar cap that
follows from the purely dipolar geometry of pulsar magnetic field. Most
plausible explanation of this phenomena is an assumption that the magnetic
field at the stellar surface differs essentially from the purely dipolar field.
We can determine magnetic field at the surface by the conservation of the
magnetic flux through the area bounded by open magnetic field lines. Then the
value of the surface magnetic field can be estimated as of the order of
$10^{14}$ G. On the other hand observations show that the temperature of the
hot spot is about a few million Kelvins. Based on these observations the
Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed which assumes that the
temperature of the actual polar cap (hot spot) equals to the so called critical
temperature.
  We discuss correlation between the temperature and corresponding area of the
thermal X-ray emission for a number of pulsars. The results of our analysis
show that the PSG model is suitable to explain both cases: when the hot spot is
smaller and larger then conventional polar cap. We argue that in the second
case structure and curvature of field lines allow pair creation in the closed
field lines region thus the secondary particles can heat the stellar surface
outside the actual polar cap.
  We have found that the Curvature Radiation (CR) plays dominant role in
avalanche pair production in the PSG. We studied dependence of the PSG
parameters on the pulsar period, the magnetic field strength and the curvature
of field lines.

anomalous microwave emission (AME). This assignation is based on an observed
tight correlation between the mid-IR emission of PAHs and the AME; and a good
agreement between models of spinning dust and the broadband AME spectrum. So
far often detected at large scale in the diffuse interstellar medium, the AME
has recently been studied in detail in well-known dense molecular clouds with
the help of Planck data. While much attention has been given to the physics of
spinning dust emission, the impact of varying local physical conditions has not
yet been considered in detail. Our aim is to study the emerging spinning dust
emission from interstellar clouds with realistic physical conditions and
radiative transfer. We use the DustEM code from Compiegne et al. to describe
the extinction and IR emission of all dust populations. The spinning dust
emission is obtained with SpDust, as described by Silsbee et al., that we have
coupled to DustEM. We carry out full radiative transfer simulations and
carefully estimate the local gas state as a function of position within
interstellar clouds. We show that the spinning dust emission is sensitive to
the abundances of the major ions and we propose a simple scheme to estimate
these abundances. We also investigate the effect of changing the cosmic-ray
rate. In dense media, where radiative transfer is mandatory, we show that the
relationship between the spinning and mid-IR emissivities of PAHs is no longer
linear and that the spinning dust emission may actually be strong at the centre
of clouds where the mid-IR PAH emission is weak. These results provide new ways
to trace grain growth from diffuse to dense medium and will be useful for the
analysis of AME at the scale of interstellar clouds.

for more softer and broader, power law-like emission spectra. We introduce a

few) of these components become distinct over the ""background"" emission,
producing hard spectral features and/or hardening of the observed spectra. We
show that this model can explain the peculiar high-energy characteristics of

role to play in the stellar evolution and a fine-tuning of this parameter at
various stages of presupernova evolution is the key to generate an explosion.
During the presupernova evolution of massive stars, isotopes of iron, mainly
$^{54,55,56}$Fe, are considered to be key players in controlling $Y_{e}$ ratio
via electron capture on these nuclide. Recently an improved microscopic
calculation of weak interaction mediated rates for iron isotopes was introduced
using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA)
theory. The pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic \textit{state-by-state}
calculation of stellar capture rates which greatly increases the reliability of

magnetic field topology. For example, magnetic fields are able to lower the
cutoff frequency for acoustic waves thus allowing waves which would otherwise
be trapped below the photosphere to propagate into the upper atmosphere.
Another example is that MHD waves can be transmitted or converted into other
forms of waves at altitudes where the sound speed equals the Alfv\'en speed. We
take advantage of the large field-of-view provided by the IBIS experiment to
study the wave propagation at two heights in the solar atmosphere, as sampled
by the photospheric Fe 617.3 nm spectral line and the chromospheric Ca 854.2 nm
spectral line, and its relationship to the local magnetic field. Among other
things, we find substantial leakage of waves with 5-minute periods in the
chromosphere at the edges of a pore and in the diffused magnetic field
surrounding it. By using spectro-polarimetric inversions of Hinode SOT/SP data,
we also find a relationship between the photospheric power spectrum and the
magnetic field inclination angle; in particular, well-defined transmission
peaks around 25\degree for 5 minutes waves and around 15\degree for 3 minutes
waves. We propose a very simple model based upon wave transmission theory to
explain this behavior. Finally, an analysis of both the power spectra and
chromospheric amplification spectra suggests the presence of longitudinal
acoustic waves along the magnetic field lines.

masses in cataclysmic variables (CVs) significantly exceed the mean mass of

high-precision measurements of WD masses in a great number of CVs are
challenging this interpretation. We review the measured WD masses of CVs,
determine the WD-mass distribution of an extensive sample of
post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) that are representative for the
progenitors of the current CV population (pre-CVs) and compare both
distributions. We calculate the CV formation time of the PCEBs in our sample by
determining the post common-envelope (CE) and the main-sequence evolution of
the binary systems and define a pre-CV to be a PCEB that evolves into a
semi-detached configuration with stable mass transfer within less than the age
of the Galaxy. Possible observational biases affecting the WD-mass distribution
for the pre-CV and the CV samples are discussed. The mean WD mass among CVs is
<Mwd>=0.83\pm0.23 Msun, much larger than that found for pre-CVs,
<Mwd>=0.67\pm0.21 Msun. Selection effects cannot explain the high WD masses
observed in CVs and we here suggest two possible explanations, both of which
imply substantial revisions to the standard model of CV evolution: either most
CVs have formed above the orbital-period gap (which requires a high WD mass to
initiate stable mass transfer or a previous phase of thermal-timescale mass
transfer), or the mass of the WDs in CVs grows through accretion (which
strongly disagrees with the predictions of classical nova models). Both options
may imply that CVs contribute to the single-degenerate progenitors of Type Ia
supernovae. The number of He-core WDs found in CVs (<=10%) is roughly
consistent with the number of He-core WDs in pre-CVs (<=17+-8%), which
indicates a low value of the CE efficiency.

evolution of the particle and B-field energetics. However, these results are
based on assumptions of the shape and extension of the GRG lobe electron
spectrum. We re-examine the energetics of GRG lobes as derived by inverse
Compton scattering of CMB photons (ICS-CMB) by relativistic electrons in RG
lobes to assess the physical conditions of RG lobes, their energetics and their
radiation regime. We consider the GRG DA 240 recently observed by Suzaku as a
reference case and we also discuss other RG lobes observed with Chandra and
XMM. We model the spectral energy distribution of the DA 240 East lobe to get
constraint on the shape and the extension of the electron spectrum in the lobe
by using multi-frequency information from radio to gamma-rays. We use radio and
X-ray data to constrain the shape and normalization of the electron spectrum
and we then calculate the SZ effect expected in GRG lobes that is sensitive to
the total electron energy density. We show that the electron energy density U_e
derived form X-ray observations yields only a rough lower limit to its actual
value and that most of the estimates of U_e based on X-ray measurements have to
be increased even by a large factor by considering realistic estimates of the
lower electron momentum p_1. This brings RG lobes away from the equipartition
condition towards a particle-dominated and Compton power dominance regime. We
use the distribution of RG lobes in the U_e/U_B vs. U_e/U_CMB plane as a
further divide between different physical regimes of particle and field
dominance, and radiation mechanism dominance in RG lobes. We conclude that the
SZ effect produced by ICS-CMB mechanism observable in RG lobes provides
reliable estimate of p_1 and U_e and is the best tool to determine the total
energy density of RG lobes and to assess their physical regime.

considerably larger than that considered previously. For the extreme strong
disorder case (Min-Max system), associated with the Directed Percolation model,
the expected value of the meandering exponent, zeta = 0.5 is clearly revealed,
with very week finite size effects. For the week disorder case, associated with
the KPZ equation, finite size effects are stronger, but the value of seta is
clearly seen in the vicinity of 0.57. In systems with ""strong disorder"" it is
expected that the system will cross over sharply from Min-Max behavior at short
chains to weak disorder behavior at long chains. This is indeed what we find.
These results indicate that 1+4 is not the Upper Critical Dimension (UCD) in
the week disorder case, and thus 4+1 does not seem to be the upper critical

carried out with the HIFI instrument on board Herschel, allowing us to resolve
the line profiles and providing insights into the spatial distribution of the
emission. Our interpretation of the observations, with the use of radiative
transfer calculations, indicates that both HF and HCl are formed in the inner
regions of the envelope close to the AGB star. Thermochemical equilibrium
calculations predict HF and HCl to be the major reservoirs of fluorine and
chlorine in the atmospheres of AGB stars. The abundances relative to H2 derived
for HF and HCl, 8e-9 and 1e-7 respectively, are substantially lower than those
predicted by thermochemical equilibrium, indicating that F and Cl are likely
affected by significant depletion onto dust grains, although some chlorine may
be in the form of atomic Cl. The H35Cl/H37Cl abundance ratio is 3.3 +/- 0.3.
The low abundance derived for HF in IRC +10216 makes it likely that the
fluorine abundance is not enhanced over the solar value by nucleosynthesis in
the AGB star, although this conclusion may not be robust because the HF
abundance we derive is a lower limit to the elemental abundance of F. These
observations suggest that both HF and HCl should be detectable through low J
rotational transitions in other evolved stars.

provides high signal to noise ratios in the radio images. Thus, one can image
the jet out to large distances ($ > 10^{15}$ cm). This combined with the
broadband coverage make this epoch the best suited for modeling the jet. The
parametric method developed in the papers \cite{ghi85,ghi89,ghi96,sam97} that
has been successfully utilized in the realm of extragalactic radio jets is
implemented. The basic model is one where external inverse Compton (EIC)
scattering of accretion disk photons by jet plasma provides the hard X-ray
powerlaw. Unlike AGN jets, it is found that the radio jet must be highly
stratified in the transverse direction in order to produce the observed surface
brightness distribution in the radio images. Various jet models are considered.
The jet power is $Q \approx 3-4 \times 10^{38}$ ergs/sec if the hard X-ray
powerlaw luminosity is from EIC in the jet and $Q \approx 2 - 9 \times 10^{37}$
ergs/sec if the X-rays are emitted from the accretion disk corona. These
estimates indicate that the jet power can be as high as 60% of the total X-ray
luminosity.

hyperfine interactions (Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 183201 (2009)). The main effect
of hyperfine interactions for spin relaxation cross sections is that the
kinetic energy release of the dominant outgoing channels does not reduce to
zero at low fields. This results in reduced centrifugal suppression on the
cross sections and increased inelastic cross sections at low energy and low
field. We also analyze state-to-state cross sections, for various initial
states, and show that hyperfine interactions introduce additional mechanisms
for spin relaxation. In particular, there are hyperfine-mediated collisions to
outgoing channels that are not centrifugally suppressed. However, for Mg+NH
these unsuppressed channels make only small contributions to the total cross
sections. We consider the implications of our results for sympathetic cooling
of NH by Mg and conclude that the ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections

potentials find applications in $d=4$ dimensions, too. Higgs, inflaton and

theory can be mapped onto the neutral Coulomb-gas (CG) in arbitrary dimension

obtained in the dilute gas approximation. It signals a single phase for $d>2$,

neutron-nucleus optical model potential. Based on the existing experimental
data of elastic scattering angular distributions for neutron as projectile, we
obtain a set of the isospin dependent global neutron-nucleus optical model
potential parameters, which can basically reproduce the experimental data for
target nuclei from $^{24}$Mg to $^{242}$Pu with the energy region up to 200
MeV.

  Calculus","32",,,,"math.HO math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a characterization of the completeness of the field of real
numbers in the form of a \emph{collection of ten equivalent statements}
borrowed from algebra, real analysis, general topology and non-standard
analysis. We also discuss the completeness of non-Archimedean fields and
present several examples of such fields. As an application we exploit one of
our results to argue that the Leibniz infinitesimal calculus in the
$18^\textrm{th}$ century was already a rigorous branch of mathematics -- at
least much more rigorous than most contemporary mathematicians prefer to
believe. By advocating our particular historical point of view, we hope to
provoke a discussion on the importance of mathematical rigor in mathematics and
science in general. We believe that our article will be of interest for those
readers who teach courses on abstract algebra, real analysis, general topology,
logic and the history of mathematics.
