motion under a barrier is impossible in classical mechanics. With quantum
effects a motion of a particle through a barrier is allowed due to quantum
tunneling. According to usual theories of tunneling, the particle density
decays inside a classical barrier resulting in an extremely slow pentration
process. However, there are no general laws forbidding fast motion through
classical barriers. The problem addressed is investigation of unusual features
o quantum tunneling through a classic static barrier which is at least
two-dimensional. Here we show that penetration through such barrier can be not
slow. When the barrier satisfies the certain conditions, a regime of quantum
lens is possible with formation of caustics. De Broglie waves are reflected
from the caustics, interfere, and result in a not small flux from under the

under-barrier density. We construct a particular example of fast motion through
a classical barrier. One can unexectedly conclude that, in principle, nature
allows fast penetration through classical barriers which against common sense.
The phenomenon may be responsible for a variety of processes in labs and
nature. For example, tunneling in solids may occur with a different scenario,
in biophysics and chemistry one can specify conditions for unusual reactions,
and evanescent optical waves may strongly change their properties. In condensed
matter and cosmic physics there are phenomena with misterious reasons of an
energy emission, for instance, gamma-ray bursts. One can try to treat them in
the context of fast escape from under some barriers.

on the channel variations of the wireless environment. This type of approach is
not always suitable for wireless networks where the channel remains static for
most of the network lifetime. For these scenarios, a channel independent
physical layer security measure is more appropriate which will rely on a secret
known to the sender and the receiver but not to the eavesdropper. In this
paper, we propose CD-PHY, a physical layer security technique that exploits the
constellation diversity of wireless networks which is independent of the

constellation symbol mapping to secure the physical layer communication which
is not known a priori to the eavesdropper. Through theoretical modeling and
experimental simulation, we show that this information theoretic construct can
achieve Shannon secrecy and any brute force attack from the eavesdropper incurs
high overhead and minuscule probability of success. Our results also show that
the high bit error rate also makes decoding practically infeasible for the
eavesdropper, thus securing the communication between the sender and receiver.

eigenmodes of the secular behavior, rather than current orbital elements, can
help identify tidal effects, early planet-planet scattering, and dynamical
coupling among the planets, for systems in which mean-motion resonances do not
play a role. Although tidal damping can result in aligned major axes after all
but one eigenmode have damped away, such alignment may simply be fortuitous. An
example of this is 55 Cancri (orbital solution of Fischer et al., 2008) where
multiple eigenmodes remain undamped. Various solutions for 55 Cancri are
compared, showing differing dynamical groupings, with implications for the
coupling of eccentricities and for the partitioning of damping among the
planets. Solutions for orbits that include expectations of past tidal evolution
with observational data, must take into account which eigenmodes should be
damped, rather than expecting particular eccentricities to be near zero.
Classical secular theory is only accurate for low eccentricity values, but
comparison with other results suggests that it can yield useful qualitative
descriptions of behavior even for moderately large eccentricity values, and may
have advantages for revealing underlying physical processes and, as large
numbers of new systems are discovered, for triage to identify where more
comprehensive dynamical studies should have priority.

gyrosynchrotron radiation generated by accelerated electrons in coronal

pitch-angle distribution of the emitting electrons and the source geometry. In
this work, we perform systematic simulations of solar microwave emission using
recently developed tools (GS Simulator and fast gyrosynchrotron codes) capable
of simulating maps of radio brightness and polarization as well as spatially
resolved emission spectra. A 3D model of a symmetric dipole magnetic loop is
used. We compare the emission from isotropic and anisotropic (of loss-cone
type) electron distributions. We also investigate effects caused by
inhomogeneous distribution of the emitting particles along the loop. It is
found that effect of the adopted moderate electron anisotropy is the most
pronounced near the footpoints and it also depends strongly on the loop
orientation. Concentration of the emitting particles at the loop top results in
a corresponding spatial shift of the radio brightness peak, thus reducing
effects of the anisotropy. The high-frequency (around 50 GHz) emission spectral
index is specified mainly by the energy spectrum of the emitting electrons;
however, at intermediate frequencies (around 10-20 GHz), the spectrum shape is
strongly dependent on the electron anisotropy, spatial distribution, and
magnetic field nonuniformity. The implications of the obtained results for the
diagnostics of the energetic electrons in solar flares are discussed.

narrowness of the distribution of masses of the underlying neutron-star

permit a direct, independent measurement of the distance to the source systems.
If the redshift of the source is known, these inspiraling double-neutron-star
binary systems can be used as standard sirens to extract cosmological
information. Unfortunately, the redshift and the system chirp mass are
degenerate in GW observations. Thus, most previous work has assumed that the
source redshift is obtained from electromagnetic counterparts. In this paper,
we explore what we can learn about the background cosmology and the mass
distribution of neutron stars from the set of neutron-star (NS) mergers
detected by such a network. We use a Bayesian formalism to analyze catalogs of
NS-NS inspiral detections. We find that it is possible to constrain the Hubble
constant, H_0, and the parameters of the NS mass function using
gravitational-wave data alone, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts.
Under reasonable assumptions, we will be able to determine H_0 to +/- 10% using
~100 observations, provided the Gaussian half-width of the underlying double NS
mass distribution is less than 0.04 solar masses. The expected precision
depends linearly on the intrinsic width of the NS mass function, but has only a
weak dependence on H_0 near the default parameter values. Finally, we consider
what happens if, for some fraction of our data catalog, we have an
electromagnetically measured redshift. The detection, and cataloging, of these
compact-object mergers will allow precision astronomy, and provide a
determination of H_0 which is independent of the local distance scale.

with nonlinear diffusion are popular models for nonlocal aggregation phenomenon
and are a source of a number of interesting mathematical problems in nonlinear
PDE. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, we continue our previous work,
which focused on nonlocal aggregation, modeled with a convolution. The goal was
to unify the local and global theory of these convolution-type models,
including the identification of a sharp critical mass; however, some cases
involving unbounded domains were left open. In particular, the biologically
relevant case $\Real^2$ was not treated. In this paper, we present an
alternative proof of local existence, which now applies to $\Real^d$ for all $d
\geq 2$ and give global results that were left open. The proof departs from
previous work in that it uses a more direct and intuitive regularization that
constructs approximate solutions on $\Real^d$ instead of on sequences of

exclusion boundaries on these models, finding that the LSP mass should be at
least about 92 GeV, with a corresponding boundary gaugino mass M_1/2 above
about 485 GeV. In contrast to the higher mass constraints established for the
CMSSM, we find the minimum exclusion boundary on the FSU5 gluino and heavy
squark masses resides in the range of 658-674 GeV and 854-1088 GeV,
respectively, with a minimum light stop squark mass of about 520 GeV. Moreover,
we show that elements of the surviving parameter space not only escape the
onslaught of LHC data which is currently decimating the standard mSUGRA/CMSSM
benchmarks, but are further able to efficiently explain certain tantalizing
production excesses over the SM background which have been reported by the CMS
collaboration. We also extend this study comparatively to five distinct
collider energies and four specific cut methodologies, including a proposed set
of selection cuts designed to reveal the natural ultra-high jet multiplicity
signal associated with the stable mass hierarchy m_t < m_g < m_q of the FSU5
models. By so doing, we demonstrate that a rather stable enhancement in model
visibility, conservatively of order ten, may be attained by adoption of these
cuts, which is sufficient for an immediate and definitive testing of a majority
of the model space using only the existing LHC data set. We stress the point
that habits established in lower jet multiplicity searches do not necessarily
carry over into the ultra-high jet multiplicity search regime.

provide a large set of models exploring the observational consequences of

this will ultimately help to distinguish between different physical mechanisms
of planet formation. However, the exact entropies and radii of newly-formed
planets due to these two modes of formation cannot, at present, be precisely
predicted. We introduce a broad range of ""Warm Start"" gas-giant planet models.
Between the hottest and the coldest models that we consider, differences in
radii, temperatures, luminosities, and spectra persist for only a few million
to a few tens of millions of years for planets that are a few times Jupiter's
mass or less. For planets that are ~five times Jupiter's mass or more,
significant differences between hottest-start and coldest-start models persist
for on the order of 100 Myrs. We find that out of the standard infrared bands
(J, H, K, L', M, N) the K and H bands are the most diagnostic of the initial
conditions. A hottest-start model can be from ~4.5 magnitudes brighter (at
Jupiter's mass) to ~9 magnitudes brighter (at ten times Jupiter's mass) than a
coldest-start model in the first few million years. In more massive objects,
these large differences in luminosity and spectrum persist for much longer than

hundreds of parsecs, where many of the GCs are doomed to collide, and
eventually merge. Several such objects appear likely to present a significant
range in ages, hence possibly metallicities, and their merger could plausibly
lead to multi-metallic GCs. Here we explore this process with direct-summation
N-body simulations with GPU hardware. Our results reveal that colliding GCs
with different metallicities and ages can produce a GC with multiplicity and
occupation fractions not unlike those observed in multi-metallic clusters. In
our simulations, the merged clusters have a phase with a larger amount of
flattening than average, as a consequence of rapid rotation- thus suggesting
that relatively recent mergers may play a role in producing highly flattened,
multi-metallic clusters. We additionally explore the role of the King parameter
of the cluster in the occupation fractions with a set of 160 direct-summation
simulations and find that for equal size clusters the King parameter of the
progenitor clusters determines the occupation fractions in the merger product,
while in unequal size mergers the size of the clusters dominates the
distribution of stars in the new GC. In particular, we find that the observed
distribution of populations in Omega Cen can be described to some extent with
our dynamical models.

Relativity (GR) and MBH properties, as well as the stellar distribution about
these holes in galactic nuclei. Current data analysis techniques can provide us
with parameter estimation with very narrow errors. However, an EMRI is not a
two-body problem, since other stellar bodies orbiting nearby will influence the
capture orbit. Any deviation from the isolated inspiral will induce a small,
though observable deviation from the idealised waveform which could be
misinterpreted as a failure of GR. Based on conservative analysis of mass
segregation in a Milky Way like nucleus, we estimate that the possibility that
another star has a semi-major axis comparable to that of the EMRI is
non-negligible, although probably very small. This star introduces an
observable perturbation in the orbit in the case in which we consider only loss
of energy via gravitational radiation. When considering the two first-order
non-dissipative post-Newtonian contributions (the periapsis shift of the
orbit), the evolution of the orbital elements of the EMRI turns out to be
chaotic in nature. The implications of this study are twofold. From the one
side, the application to testing GR and measuring MBHs parameters with the
detection of EMRIs in galactic nuclei with a millihertz mission will be even
more challenging than believed. From the other side, this behaviour could in
principle be used as a signature of mass segregation in galactic nuclei.

innermost stellar kinematics of globular clusters (GCs) or small galaxies, the
possible natural loci to IMBHs, are very difficult to resolve. However, if
IMBHs reside in the centre of GCs, a possibility is that they interact
dynamically with their environment. A binary formed with the IMBH and a compact
object of the GC would naturally lead to a prominent source of gravitational
radiation, detectable with future observatories. We use N-body simulations to
study the evolution of GCs containing an IMBH and calculate the gravitational
radiation emitted from dynamically formed IMBH-SBH binaries and the possibility
that the IMBH escapes the GC after an IMBH-SBH merger. We run for the first
time direct-summation integrations of GCs with an IMBH including the dynamical
evolution of the IMBH with the stellar system and relativistic effects, such as
energy loss in gravitational waves (GWs) and periapsis shift, and gravitational
recoil. We find in one of our models an intermediate mass-ratio inspiral
(IMRI), which leads to a merger with a recoiling velocity higher than the
escape velocity of the GC. The GWs emitted fall in the range of frequencies
that a LISA-like observatory could detect, like the European eLISA or in
mission options considered in the recent preliminary mission study conducted in
China. The merger has an impact on the global dynamics of the cluster, as an
important heating source is removed when the merged system leaves the GC. The
detection of one IMRI would constitute a test of GR, as well as an irrefutable
proof of the existence of IMBHs.

Axisymmetric Multi-Gaussian mass model, we investigate the limit that a relaxed
mass distribution produces all of the measured velocity dispersion, and find an
upper limit on the black hole mass at $2.0 \pm 0.2 \times 10^9 M_{\sun}$. When

compare Keplerian velocity fields to the measured two-dimensional velocity

temperature). Firm conclusions cannot be drawn for the other two
Spitzer-observed CHVCs since their small-scale HI structures are not
sufficiently well known; nonetheless, no extended dust emission is apparent

content, and dust-corrected SFRs are constrained using broadband SED fitting,
giving insights into the nature of these low-mass systems. First, a correlation
found between rest-frame UV luminosity and galaxy stellar mass suggests that
many sub-L* galaxies at z~2.3 may have approximately constant star formation
histories. A nearly-linear relation between stellar mass and star formation
rate is also found, hinting that the rate at which a sub-L* BX galaxy forms its
stars is directly related to the mass of stars that it has already formed. A
possible explanation is that new gas that falls onto the galaxy's host halo
along with accreting dark matter is the source of fuel for ongoing star
formation. The instantaneous efficiency of star formation is low in this
scenario, of order 1%. The low-mass end of the stellar mass function is steeper
than expected from extrapolations of shallower surveys, resulting in a SMD at
z~2.3 that's ~25% of the present-day value; this value is z~1.5-2x higher than
that given by extrapolations of shallower surveys, suggesting that the build-up
of stellar mass in the universe has proceeded more rapidly than previously
thought. An update to the KDF z~2 UV LF finds a steeper faint-end slope than
previously reported, though not as steep as that found by Reddy & Steidel
(2009). Finally, sub-L* galaxies at z~2 carry very small amounts of dust
compared to their more luminous cousins, so that while only ~20% of 1700A
photons escape from a typical M* galaxy, more than half make it out of an M*+3
one. This paucity of dust highlights the fact that sub-L* galaxies are not
simple scaled copies of their more luminous cousins. It also suggests that
sub-L* are important contributors to keeping the Universe ionized at z~2.

chiral matter spectrum of a gauge theory which include those necessary for the
absence of cubic nonabelian anomalies, but also contain some additional
conditions. In the class of theories we study, some of these are present in a
field theory augmented by anomalous U(1)'s and Chern-Simons terms, but some are
genuinely not present in field theory. Their violation has phenomenological
implications, rendering inconsistent many quiver gauge theories with the chiral
matter spectrum of the MSSM. The inconsistent MSSM quivers often violate the
constraints in a particular way that is suggestive of what matter must be added
for consistency. The preferred matter additions are MSSM singlets with
anomalous U(1) charge, hyperchargeless SU(2) triplets, quasichiral Higgs or
lepton isodoublet pairs, quasichiral quark isosinglet pairs, and nonabelian
singlets with charge +-1. Smaller numbers of quark isodoublet pairs, lepton
pairs with charges (+- 1,+- 2), and chiral fourth families are also found. We
present the results of systematic analyses including multiplicity counts of
matter beyond the standard model and also study the possibility of using the
singlets for a dynamical perturbative \mu-term or for neutrino mass. We also
systematically study the appearance of additional non-anomalous U(1)'
symmetries in the low energy theory and find that family non-universality is
very common. These new physics effects may be observable at the LHC even for a
large string scale close to the Planck scale.

\[ H^G_*(G/H,E(A))=E_*(A\rtimes H) \] If now $\cF$ is a nonempty family of

that the strong $(G,\cF,E,P)$ isomorphism conjecture for $(G,\cF)$-proper $P$
is true in several cases of interest in the algebraic $K$-theory context. Thus
we give a purely algebraic, discrete counterpart to a result of Guentner,
Higson and Trout in the $C^*$-algebraic case. We apply this to show that under
rather general hypothesis, the assembly map $H_*^G(\cE(G,\cF),E(A))\to
E_*(A\rtimes G)$ can be identified with the boundary map in the long exact
sequence of $E$-groups associated to certain exact sequence of rings. Along the

promising tool to follow the time evolution of cosmological perturbations at
small redshifts and at mildly nonlinear scales. All these schemes are based on
two approximations: the existence of a smoothing scale and the single-stream
approximation, where velocity dispersion of the dark matter fluid, as well as
higher moments of the particle distributions, are neglected. Despite being
widely recognized, these two assumptions are, in principle, incompatible, since
any finite smoothing scale gives rise to velocity dispersion and higher moments
at larger scales. We describe a new approach to perturbation theory, where the
Vlasov and fluid equations are derived in presence of a finite coarse-graining
scale: this allows a clear separation between long and short distance modes and
leads to a hybrid approach where the former are treated perturbatively and the
effect of the latter is encoded in external source terms for velocity, velocity
dispersion, and all the higher order moments, which can be computed from N-body
simulations. We apply the coarse-grained perturbation theory to the computation
of the power spectrum and the cross-spectrum between density and velocity
dispersion, and compare the results with N-body simulations, finding good
agreement.

systems with broken continuous symmetry. It is expected in antiferromagnets,
short coherence length superconductors, charge density waves, and lattice Bose
condensates. Its detection is a valuable test of the corresponding field
theory, and its mass gap measures the proximity to a quantum critical point.
However, since the amplitude mode can decay into low-energy Goldstone modes,
its experimental visibility has been questioned. Here we show that the
visibility depends on the symmetry of the measured susceptibility. The
longitudinal susceptibility diverges at low frequency as \chi_{\sigma\sigma} ~
i/\omega (d=2) or log(1/|\omega|) (d=3), which can completely obscure the
amplitude peak. In contrast, the scalar susceptibility is suppressed by four
extra powers of frequency, exposing the amplitude peak throughout the ordered
phase. We discuss experimental setups for measuring the scalar susceptibility.
The conductivity of the O(2) theory (relativistic superfluid) is a scalar
response and therefore exhibits suppressed absorption below the Higgs mass
threshold, \sigma ~ \omega^{2d+1}. In layered, short coherence length
superconductors, (relevant e.g. to cuprates) this threshold is raised by the
interlayer plasma frequency.

the majority of GCs, Omega Cen exhibits significant star-to-star variations in
metallicity and in relative neutron-capture element abundance ratios with
respect to Fe, along with split evolutionary sequences as revealed from
colour-magnitude diagrams. Combining information from photometry and
spectroscopy, several studies suggested that an age spread of several Gyr has
to be invoked to explain (at least partially) some of the observed features.
However, a comprehensive understanding of the formation, evolution and chemical
enrichment processes is still not at hand. Relatively metal-rich Omega cen
stars display neutron-capture abundance distributions dominated by
contributions from the s-process, but it is not clear what roles have been
played by the so-called main and weak s-process components in generating these
abundances. To gain better insight into this question we derived lead (Pb)
abundances for several cluster members, because this element can only be
produced by the main s-process. We analysed high-resolution UVES@VLT spectra of
a sample of twelve red-giant branch stars, deriving abundances of Pb and also
of Y, Zr, La, Ce, Eu, and the C+N+O sum. Spectral synthesis was applied to all
features, taking into account isotopic shifts and/or hyperfine structure as
needed. We measured for the first time the Pb content in Omega Cen, discovering
a clear hint for a Pb production occurring at [Fe/H]>-1.7 dex. Our data suggest
that the role of the weak component in the production of s-process elements is
negligible. Moreover, evidence gathered from the abundances of other elements
indicates that the main component occurring in this GC is peculiar and shifted
towards higher mass polluters than the standard one.

inner bubbles at 0.6 kpc, filled with 5 GHz and 1.5 GHz radio plasma and
coincident with Halpha emission, and in a ghost bubble at 5.2 kpc west of NGC
5846's nucleus. The outburst energy and ages for the inner (ghost) bubbles are
~10^{55} ergs and ~2 Myr (~ 5 x 10^{55} ergs and 12 Myr), respectively,
implying an AGN duty cycle of 10 Myr. The inner bubble rims are threaded with 9

Nevertheless, within domains of the size of inverse graviton mass we find
approximately homogeneous and isotropic solutions that can well describe the
past and present of the Universe. At energy densities above a certain crossover
value, these solutions approximate the standard FRW evolution with great
accuracy. As the Universe evolves and density drops below the crossover value
the inhomogeneities become more and more pronounced. In the low density regime
each domain of the size of the inverse graviton mass has essentially non-FRW

roughly estimate to be an order of magnitude below the present-day value of the
Hubble parameter. The bound becomes especially restrictive if one utilizes an
exact self-accelerated solution that this theory offers. Although the above are
robust predictions of massive gravity with an explicit mass term, we point out
that if the mass parameter emerges from some additional scalar field

of either quasars being obscured due to dust, or the consequence of many GRBs
being strongly gravitationally lensed. We analyze observations of GRBs that
show strong foreground MgII absorption. We Monte-Carlo the distances between
foreground galaxies in the HUDF and lines of sight distributed randomly within
a radius derived from the covering factor, and find that galaxies are located
systematically closer to the position of the observed GRBs than expected for
random lines of sight. This over-density at small impact parameters is
statistically more robust than the well known excess of MgII absorbers among
GRB afterglow spectra, and presents a new puzzle for MgII absorption studies.
The over-density cannot be explained by obscuration in the GRB sample, but is a
natural consequence of gravitational lensing. Upon examining the particular
configurations of galaxies near a sample of GRBs with strong MgII absorption,
we find several intriguing lensing candidates. Our results suggest that lensing
provides a viable contribution to the observed enhancement of strong MgII
absorption along lines of sight to GRBs, and we outline the future observations
required to test this hypothesis conclusively.

whether the minimal (in a precise sense) multistationary chemical reaction
networks, which we propose to call `atoms of multistationarity,' characterize
the entire set of multistationary networks. Our main result states that the
answer to this question is `yes' in the context of fully open continuous-flow
stirred-tank reactors (CFSTRs), which are networks in which all chemical
species take part in the inflow and outflow. In order to prove this result, we
show that if a subnetwork admits multiple steady states, then these steady
states can be lifted to a larger network, provided that the two networks share
the same stoichiometric subspace. We also prove an analogous result when a
smaller network is obtained from a larger network by `removing species.' Our
results provide the mathematical foundation for a technique used by
Siegal-Gaskins et al. of establishing bistability by way of `network ancestry.'
Additionally, our work provides sufficient conditions for establishing
multistationarity by way of atoms and moreover reduces the problem of
classifying multistationary CFSTRs to that of cataloging atoms of
multistationarity. As an application, we enumerate and classify all 386
bimolecular and reversible two-reaction networks. Of these, exactly 35 admit
multiple positive steady states. Moreover, each admits a unique minimal
multistationary subnetwork, and these subnetworks form a poset (with respect to
the relation of `removing species') which has 11 minimal elements (the atoms of
multistationarity).

crossing this radius can move from orbiting the cluster centre to independently
orbiting the galaxy. In this paper, the stability radius of a globular cluster
is estimated using a novel approach from the theoretical standpoint of the

transition radius between stable and unstable orbits in a globular cluster. A
stability analysis, outlined by Mardling, is used here to predict the
occurrence of unstable stellar orbits in the outermost region of a globular
cluster in a distant orbit around a galaxy. It is found that the eccentricity
of the cluster-galaxy orbit has a far more significant effect on the stability
radius of globular clusters than previous theoretical results of the tidal
radius have found. A simple analytical formula is given for determining the
transition between stable and unstable orbits, which is analogous to the tidal
radius for a globular cluster. The stability radius estimate is interior to
tidal radius estimates and gives the innermost region from which stars can
random walk to their eventual escape from the cluster. The time-scale for this
random walk process is also estimated using numerical three-body scattering
experiments.

Milky Way GCs, or lack thereof, is explained by recourse to the stability of
the three-body problem in Newtonian dynamics. The previous paper in this series
determined an analytical formula for the transition radius between stable and
unstable orbits for a star in a GC. This stability boundary is used here to
predict where the velocity dispersion profile is expected to flatten in GCs,
given known orbital parameters of the GC-galaxy orbit. Published observational
data for the velocity dispersion as a function of radius of 15 Milky Way GCs
with approximately known orbital parameters are used here. We find that the
stability boundary predicts flattening in the majority of clusters. While
observational uncertainties in the orbital parameters prevent MOND from being
ruled out entirely for some clusters, it is not the preferred model in any
cluster. Based on the results of this study, we recommend further velocity
dispersion observations and orbital determination for NGC 6171 and NGC 6341 as
these are promising candidates for distinguishing Newtonian and MOND models. In
particular, NGC 6171 may already be showing evidence of the chaotic diffusion

functional theory is used for electronic structure and bonding in
Au_(144-x)Ag_x(SR)_60 based on a structural model of the icosahedral
Au_144(SR)_60 that features a 114-atom metal core with 60 symmetry-equivalent
surface sites, and a protecting layer of 30 RSAuSR units. In the optimal
configuration the 60 surface sites of the core are occupied by silver in
Au_84Ag_60(SR)_60. Silver enhances the electron shell structure around the
Fermi level in the metal core, which predicts a structured absorption spectrum
around the onset (about 0.8 eV) of electronic metal-to-metal transitions. The
calculations also imply element-dependent absorption edges for Au(5d)
\rightarrow Au(6sp) and Ag(4d) \rightarrow Ag(5sp) interband transitions in the
""plasmonic"" region, with their relative intensities controlled by the Ag/Au
mixing ratio.

algorithmic game theory. There is an inherent tradeoff between how general a
language is, allowing it to capture more elaborate games, and how hard it is
computationally to optimize and solve such games. One prominent such language
is the simple yet expressive Weighted Graph Games (WGGs) representation [14],
which maintains knowledge about synergies between agents in the form of an edge
weighted graph.
  We consider the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure in WGGs.
The agents in such games are vertices in a graph, and the value of a coalition
is the sum of the weights of the edges present between coalition members. The
optimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that
maximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. We show that finding
the optimal coalition structure is not only hard for general graphs, but is
also intractable for restricted families such as planar graphs which are
amenable for many other combinatorial problems. We then provide algorithms with
constant factor approximations for planar, minor-free and bounded degree
graphs.

reversal around the rapid fading from the superoutburst. The object showed a
prominent beat phenomenon even after the end of the superoutburst. A pilot

is much larger than that of mining FI/FCI. Therefore, this paper presents an
application of frequent closed itemsets lattice (FCIL) for mining minimal
non-redundant association rules (MNAR) to reduce a lot of time for generating
rules. Firstly, we use CHARM-L for building FCIL. After that, based on FCIL, an

quintessential example in the strongly correlated electron physics where both
effects of geometric frustration and quantum fluctuation are pushed to their
limit. Among possible non-magnetic ground states, the valence bond solid (VBS)
with a 36-site unit cell is one of the most promising candidates. A natural
theoretical framework for the analysis of such VBS order is to consider quantum
states on a bond connecting the nearest-neighboring sites as fundamental
quantum modes of the system and treat them as effectively independent ""bond
particles."" While correctly describing the VBS order in the ground state, this
approach, known as the bond operator theory, significantly overestimates the
lowest spin excitation energy. To overcome this problem, we take a next logical
step in this paper to improve the bond operator theory and consider extended
spin clusters as fundamental building blocks of the system. Depending on two
possible configurations of the VBS order, various spin clusters are considered:
(i) in the VBS order with staggered hexagonal resonance, we consider one spin
cluster for a David star and two spin clusters with each composed of a perfect
hexagon and three attached dimers, and (ii) in the VBS order with uniform
hexagonal resonance, one spin cluster composed of a David star and three
attached dimers. It is shown that the majority of low-energy spin excitations
are nearly or perfectly flat in energy. With most of its weight coming from the
David star, the lowest spin excitation has a gap much lower than the previous
value obtained by the bond operator theory, narrowing the difference against
exact diagonalization results.

emission features are well reproduced with a mixture of amorphous (with
olivine, forsterite, and silica stoichiometry) and crystalline grains
(forsterite, enstatite). We explore grain size and disk structure using
radiative transfer disk models, finding that most objects have suffered
substantial evolution (grain growth, settling). About half of the disks show
inside-out evolution, with either dust-cleared inner holes or a
radially-dependent dust distribution, typically with larger grains and more
settling in the innermost disk. The typical strong silicate features require
nevertheless the presence of small dust grains, and could be explained by
differential settling according to grain size, anomalous dust distributions,
and/or optically thin dust populations within disk gaps. M-type stars tend to
have weaker silicate emission and steeper SEDs than K-type objects. The
inferred low dust masses are in a strong contrast with the relatively high gas
accretion rates, suggesting global grain growth and/or an anomalous gas to dust
ratio. Transition disks (TD) in the Cep OB2 region display strongly processed
grains, suggesting that they are dominated by dust evolution and settling.
Finally, the presence of rare but remarkable disks with strong accretion at old
ages reveals that some very massive disks may still survive to grain growth,
gravitational instabilities, and planet formation.

control of step-up-down (SUD) multiple testing procedures. It has been
established in earlier literature that for this type of procedure, under some
broad conditions, and in an asymptotical sense, the FDR is maximum when the
signal strength under the alternative is maximum. In other words, so-called
""Dirac uniform configurations"" are asymptotically {\em least favorable} in this
setting. It is known that this property also holds in a non-asymptotical sense
(for any finite number of hypotheses), for the two extreme versions of SUD
procedures, namely step-up and step-down (with extra conditions for the
step-down case). It is therefore very natural to conjecture that this
non-asymptotical {\em least favorable configuration} property could more
generally be true for all ""intermediate"" forms of SUD procedures. We prove that
this is, somewhat surprisingly, not the case. The argument is based on the
exact calculations proposed earlier by Roquain and Villers (2011), that we
extend here by generalizing Steck's recursion to the case of two populations.
Secondly, we quantify the magnitude of this phenomenon by providing a
nonasymptotic upper-bound and explicit vanishing rates as a function of the
total number of hypotheses.

transport lifetime one order of magnitude smaller than spectral lifetime of the
states involved in the transport mechanism. With increasing temperature, the
transport properties reach the Ioffe-Regel limit which is ascribed to less and
less appreciable contribution of itinerant states to the conduction process.
The model provides features of the mobility in close agreement with

intra-and inter-band transition channels. It is found that with increasing q
and carrier density, the plasmon modes couple strongly with the optic-phonon
modes in graphene. The coupled plasmon-phonon modes exhibit some interesting
features which can be utilized to realize the plasmonic devices. Our results
suggest that the carrier-phonon interaction should be considered to understand
and explain the properties of elementary electronic excitations in graphene.

often be described by an effective model, where only the lowest-energy degrees

strong trimerization limit of the spin 1/2 kagome antiferromagnet in a magnetic
field. It has been suggested that this system can be realized experimentally by
a gas of spinless fermions in an optical kagome lattice at 2/3 filling. We
investigate the low-energy behavior of both the spin 1/2 quantum version and
the classical limit of this system by applying various techniques. We study in
parallel both signs of the coupling constant J since the two cases display
qualitative differences. One of the main peculiarities of the J>0 case is that,
at the classical level, there is an exponentially large manifold of
lowest-energy configurations. This renders the thermodynamics of the system
quite exotic and interesting in this case. For both cases, J>0 and J<0, a
finite-temperature phase transition with a breaking of the discrete dihedral
symmetry group D_6 of the model is present. For J<0, we find a transition
temperature T^<_c/|J| = 1.566 +/- 0.005, i.e., of order unity, as expected. We
then analyze the nature of the transition in this case. While we find no
evidence for a discontinuous transition, the interpretation as a continuous
phase transition yields very unusual critical exponents violating the
hyperscaling relation. By contrast, in the case J>0 the transition occurs at an
extremely low temperature, T^>_c ~= 0.0125 J. Presumably this low transition
temperature is connected with the fact that the low-temperature ordered state
of the system is established by an order-by-disorder mechanism in this case.

spheres and compare the physical properties of critical non-isothermal and
isothermal gas spheres. These configurations can serve as models for prestellar
cores before gravitational collapse.
  Methods: A stability condition for non-isothermal spheres is derived by
constructing an expression for the derivative of boundary pressure with respect
to core volume. The temperature distribution is determined by means of
radiative transfer calculations. Based on the stability analysis, we derive the
physical parameters of critical cores for the mass range 0.1 - 5.0 M_sun. In
addition, the properties of roughly Jupiter-mass cores are briefly examined.
  Results: At the low-mass end the critical non-isothermal sphere has lower
central density and a slightly larger physical radius than the corresponding
isothermal sphere (i.e. one with the same mass and average temperature). The
temperature decrease towards the core centre becomes steeper towards smaller
masses as the central density becomes higher. The slope depends on the adopted
dust model. We find that the critical dimensionless radius increases above the
isothermal value xi_0 = 6.45 for very low-mass cores (< 0.2 M_sun). However, in
the mass-range studied here the changes are within 5% from the isothermal
value.
  Conclusions: The density structures of non-isothermal and isothermal
Bonnor-Ebert spheres for a given mass are fairly similar. However, the present
models predict clear differences in the average temperatures for the same
physical radius. Especially for low-mass cores, the temperature gradient
probably has implications on the chemistry and the observed line emission. We
also find that hydrostatic Jupiter-mass cores with radii less than 100 AU would
have very high boundary pressures compared with typical pressures in the
interstellar space.

On the other hand, the ballistic plus precession model likely holds in majority
samples of jet motion. This paper discusses the relationship between the
ballistic and non-ballistic model of jet motion, which suggests that the
interaction of ejectors with ambient matter can produce knots at different
stages of evolution and hence different separations to the core. And as a jet
precesses, knots produced between the core and the deceleration radius result
in spiral pattern expected by the model of ballistic plus precession; and knots
generated at the deceleration radius display non-radial motion such as bent jet
or oscillation of ridge-line. This paper develops the first non-ballistic model
in four aspects. Firstly, it provides a numerical simulation to the production
of multi-knot for a precessing jet. Secondly, it fits the precession behavior
of multi-knot and interprets the oscillation of ridge lines like S5 1803+784.
Thirdly, it gives an unified interpretation to the bent jet applicable to both

Problems (CSPs) is the notion of a relational clone, which is the set of all
relations expressible using primitive positive formulas over a particular set
of base relations. Post's lattice gives a complete classification of all
Boolean relational clones, and this has been used to classify the computational
difficulty of CSPs. Motivated by a desire to understand the computational
complexity of (weighted) counting CSPs, we develop an analogous notion of
functional clones and study the landscape of these clones. One of these clones
is the collection of log-supermodular (lsm) functions, which turns out to play
a significant role in classifying counting CSPs. In the conservative case
(where all nonnegative unary functions are available), we show that there are
no functional clones lying strictly between the clone of lsm functions and the
total clone (containing all functions). Thus, any counting CSP that contains a
single nontrivial non-lsm function is computationally as hard to approximate as
any problem in #P. Furthermore, we show that any non-trivial functional clone
(in a sense that will be made precise) contains the binary function ""implies"".
As a consequence, in the conservative case, all non-trivial counting CSPs are

Given the complexity-theoretic results, it is natural to ask whether the
""implies"" clone is equivalent to the clone of lsm functions. We use the Mobius
transform and the Fourier transform to show that these clones coincide
precisely up to arity 3. It is an intriguing open question whether the lsm
clone is finitely generated. Finally, we investigate functional clones in which
only restricted classes of unary functions are available.

hyperkahler manifold restricted to possess a special Killing vector field which
generates an SO(2) group of rotations on the two-sphere of complex structures

the target spaces of N=2 superconformal sigma models, prove to possess such a
vector field that belongs to the Lie algebra of an isometry group SU(2) acting
by rotations on the complex structures. A unique property of the N=2 sigma

  Observations",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper concerns state-based systems that interact with their environment
at physically distributed interfaces, called ports. When such a system is used
a projection of the global trace, called a local trace, is observed at each
port. This leads to the environment having reduced observational power: the set
of local traces observed need not uniquely define the global trace that
occurred. We consider the previously defined implementation relation
$\sqsubseteq_s$ and start by investigating the problem of defining a language
${\mathcal {\tilde L}} (M)$ for a multi-port finite state machine (FSM) $M$
such that $N \sqsubseteq_s M$ if and only if every global trace of $N$ is in
${\mathcal {\tilde L}} (M)$. The motivation is that if we can produce such a
language ${\mathcal {\tilde L}} (M)$ then this can potentially be used to
inform development and testing. We show that ${\mathcal {\tilde L}} (M)$ can be
uniquely defined but need not be regular. We then prove that it is generally
undecidable whether $N \sqsubseteq_s M$, a consequence of this result being
that it is undecidable whether there is a test case that is capable of
distinguishing two states or two multi-port FSM in distributed testing. This
result complements a previous result that it is undecidable whether there is a
test case that is guaranteed to distinguish two states or multi-port FSMs. We
also give some conditions under which $N \sqsubseteq_s M$ is decidable. We then
consider the implementation relation $\sqsubseteq_s^k$ that only concerns input
sequences of length $k$ or less. Naturally, given FSMs $N$ and $M$ it is
decidable whether $N \sqsubseteq_s^k M$ since only a finite set of traces is
relevant. We prove that if we place bounds on $k$ and the number of ports then
we can decide $N \sqsubseteq_s^k M$ in polynomial time but otherwise this
problem is NP-hard.

to precisely evaluate the leading order quadratic portion of the potential

is proved above critical mass using a maximum-principle type argument based on
comparing the mass distribution of solutions to a barrier consisting of the
unique stationary solutions of the scale-invariant PKS. Although effective
where standard Virial methods do not apply, this method seems to be dependent

general the preferred ones. We extend this result and show that even optimal
classical models (models with minimal internal entropy) in general are not the
best possible models (called ideal models). Instead of optimal classical models
we can construct quantum models which are significantly better but not yet the
best possible ones (i.e. they have a strictly smaller internal entropy). In
this paper we show conditions when the internal entropies between classical
models and specific quantum models coincide. Furthermore it turns out that this
situation appears very rarely. An example shows that our results hold only for
the specific quantum model construction and in general not for alternative

the presumed saddle point along the real axis of the grand canonical parameters
may exist it cannot, in general, be characterized as ""strong"", in the sense of

and the various approximations of the method can be interpreted as a tricky
reformulation of usual thermodynamic relations. The close connection of the
method with the formalism of the Laplace transform may produce wrong results if
the internal energy of the components of the ensemble is not large enough.
Therefore, although useful in many applications the Darwin-Fowler method may
not be suitable, in general, for a detailed microscopic analysis of the nuclear

growth must have occurred. For example, some levelling-off could occur at
finite time, followed either by some growth again or then by some decay.
Numerous examples show that the Verhulst and Gompertz modelisations are too
