centerpiece of the world's high energy physics program. The collider was
arguably one of the most complex research instruments ever to reach the
operation stage and is widely recognized for numerous physics discoveries and
for many technological breakthroughs. In this article we outline the historical
background that led to the construction of the Tevatron Collider, the strategy
applied to evolution of performance goals over the Tevatron's operational
history, and briefly describe operations of each accelerator in the chain and
achieved performance.

  `Is reality digital or analog?' [fqxi.org]",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum theory is extremely successful in explaining most physical phenomena,
and is not contradicted by any experiment. Yet, the theory has many puzzling
features : the occurrence of probabilities, the unclear distinction between the
microscopic and the macroscopic, the unexplained absence of superpositions in
positions of macroscopic objects, the dependence of the theory on an external
classical time, and the experimentally verified but peculiar `influence'
outside the light-cone in EPR experiments. These puzzles point towards a
conflict between quantum theory and our present understanding of spacetime
structure, and suggest the existence of a deeper theory. In this essay we make
the case that in the underlying theory the matter and spacetime degrees of
freedom are non-commuting matrices, and yet the dynamics is analog. A digital
quantum-theory like dynamics for matter as well as spacetime emerges in the
statistical thermodynamic approximation to this deeper theory. When most of the
matter clumps into macroscopic structures, it is shown to behave classically,
and it induces classical dynamics on spacetime; this is the eventual analog
limit, our macroscopic world. In between the digital layer and the uppermost
analog layer is the realm of standard quantum theory - microscopic objects and
their interaction with measuring apparatuses on a classical spacetime
background : the semi-digital approximation. Such a multi-layered description
of dynamics can explain the puzzling features of quantum theory, and is
testable by ongoing laboratory experiments.

information on numerical accuracy as well as entanglement. Their spectra can
thus be analyzed twofold. The smallest eigenvalues provide a sensitive estimate
of how much weight is discarded in the low energy description of later
iterations. As such, the discarded weight is a clear indicator of the accuracy
of a specific NRG calculation. In particular, it indicates in a site-specific
manner whether sufficiently many states have been kept within a single NRG run.
The largest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices, on the other hand,
lend themselves to a straightforward analysis in terms of entanglement spectra,
which can be combined into entanglement flow diagrams. The latter show strong
similarities with the well-known standard energy flow diagram of the NRG,
supporting the prevalent usage of entanglement spectra to characterize
different physical regimes.

We show that these systems provide no temporal guarantees on data deletion and
that deleted data still persists for nearly 44 hours with average phone use and
indefinitely if the phone is not used after the deletion. Furthermore, we show
that file overwriting and encryption, methods commonly used for secure deletion
on block-structured file systems, do not ensure data deletion in log-structured

  We propose three mechanisms for secure deletion on log-structured file

the cost of negligible device wear. Ballooning is a user-level mechanism that
runs continuously and gives probabilistic improvements to secure deletion. Zero
overwriting is a kernel-level mechanism that guarantees immediate secure
deletion without device wear. We implement these mechanisms on Nexus One
smartphones and show that they succeed in secure deletion and neither
prohibitively reduce the longevity of the flash memory nor noticeably reduce
the device's battery lifetime. These techniques provide mobile phone users more
confidence that data they delete from their phones are indeed deleted.

consideration is the spectrum of the frame operator. Indeed, the minimum and
maximum eigenvalues of the frame operator are the optimal frame bounds, and the
frame is tight precisely when this spectrum is constant. Often, the second-most
important design consideration is the lengths of frame vectors: Gabor, wavelet,
equiangular and Grassmannian frames are all special cases of equal norm frames,
and unit norm tight frame-based encoding is known to be optimally robust
against additive noise and erasures. We consider the problem of constructing
frames whose frame operator has a given spectrum and whose vectors have
prescribed lengths. For a given spectrum and set of lengths, the existence of
such frames is characterized by the Schur-Horn Theorem---they exist if and only
if the spectrum majorizes the squared lengths---the classical proof of which is
nonconstructive. Certain construction methods, such as harmonic frames and
spectral tetris, are known in the special case of unit norm tight frames, but
even these provide but a few examples from the manifold of all such frames, the
dimension of which is known and nontrivial. In this paper, we provide a new
method for explicitly constructing any and all frames whose frame operator has
a prescribed spectrum and whose vectors have prescribed lengths. The method
itself has two parts. In the first part, one chooses eigensteps---a sequence of
interlacing spectra---that transform the trivial spectrum into the desired one.
The second part is to explicitly compute the frame vectors in terms of these
eigensteps; though nontrivial, this process is nevertheless straightforward
enough to be implemented by hand, involving only arithmetic, square roots and
matrix multiplication.

when J is close to J_c, the transition to the ferromagnetic state, i.e., when

perform detailed analytic computations on the energies of the striped and

exponential decay and with power law decay r^{-p}, p>2, that depend on the
Manhattan distance instead of the Euclidean distance. We prove that the striped

the ground state structure is very large. This happens for J\lesssim J_c if

Simultaneously, the retention of the cold population's relatively unexcited

system formation model, that is driven by a transient period of instability,
where Neptune is temporarily eccentric. Here, we show that the cold belt can
survive the instability, and its dynamical structure can be reproduced. We
develop a simple analytical model for secular excitation of cold KBOs and show
that comparatively fast apsidal precession and nodal recession of Neptune,
during the eccentric phase, are essential for preservation of an unexcited

self-consistent N-body simulations. We further show that contamination of the

with polygons (faces). In this article we shall only give examples using
squares, regular hexagons, equilateral triangles and parallelograms (""unions""
of two equilateral triangles). We shall call some ""multiple"" of the fundamental
region ""the board"". We naturally identify pairs of corresponding edges of the
the board. Figures 9 and 19-29, in this article, show different boards. The
""border"" of the board is represented by a yellow thick line, unless part of it
or all of it is the edge of a face.
  The board is tiled by a finite number of polygons. Construct polygonal plates
in the same number, shape and size as the polygons of the board. Adjacent to
each side of each plate draw a number, or two numbers, like it is shown in
Figures 1 and 18-29. Figure 1 shows the obvious possibility of having plates
with simple drawings, coloured drawings, etc.
  Now the game is to put the plates over the board polygons in such a way that
the numbers near each board edge are equal. If there is at least one solution
of this puzzle one says that we have a periodical plane puzzle with numbers.
  These puzzles are a tool in teaching and learning mathematics. For those that
already have some mathematical knowledge, they are a source for many examples
and exercises, that go from the elementary to complex ones, in combinatorics,
group theory (including symmetry and permutation groups), programming, and so
on. The object of this work is to point out some possibilities by giving simple
examples.
  The computer is the only practical way of ""materializing"" infinite periodical
plane puzzles. Hence, these puzzles can be very well put into practice as
computer games.
  This article follows some others on puzzles with numbers.

film. Each pixel in the sensor has a binary response, giving only a one-bit
quantized measurement of the local light intensity. To analyze its performance,
we formulate the oversampled binary sensing scheme as a parameter estimation
problem based on quantized Poisson statistics. We show that, with a
single-photon quantization threshold and large oversampling factors, the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimation variance approaches that of
an ideal unquantized sensor, that is, as if there were no quantization in the
sensor measurements. Furthermore, the CRLB is shown to be asymptotically
achievable by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). By showing that the
log-likelihood function of our problem is concave, we guarantee the global
optimality of iterative algorithms in finding the MLE. Numerical results on
both synthetic data and images taken by a prototype sensor verify our
theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our image
reconstruction algorithm. They also suggest the potential application of the
oversampled binary sensing scheme in high dynamic range photography.

approximately reducing the mechanism design problem for multiple buyers to
single buyer sub-problems. Our framework can be applied to any setting which
roughly satisfies the following assumptions: (i) buyers' types must be
distributed independently (not necessarily identically), (ii) objective
function must be linearly separable over the buyers, and (iii) except for the
supply constraints, there should be no other inter-buyer constraints. Our
framework is general in the sense that it makes no explicit assumption about
buyers' valuations, type distributions, and single buyer constraints (e.g.,
budget, incentive compatibility, etc).
  We present two generic multi buyer mechanisms which use single buyer
mechanisms as black boxes; if an $\alpha$-approximate single buyer mechanism
can be constructed for each buyer, and if no buyer requires more than
$\frac{1}{k}$ of all units of each item, then our generic multi buyer
mechanisms are $\gamma_k\alpha$-approximation of the optimal multi buyer
mechanism, where $\gamma_k$ is a constant which is at least
$1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+3}}$. Observe that $\gamma_k$ is at least 1/2 (for $k=1$)
and approaches 1 as $k \to \infty$. As a byproduct of our construction, we
present a generalization of prophet inequalities. Furthermore, as applications
of our framework, we present multi buyer mechanisms with improved approximation
factor for several settings from the literature.

new alternatives to the positivity condition for inverse probability weighting.
The probability distribution that would govern the frequency of observations in
the counterfactual scenario can be characterized in terms of a so-called
martingale problem. The counterfactual and factual probability distributions
may be related through a likelihood ratio given by a stochastic differential
equation. We can perform inference for counterfactual scenarios based on the
original observations, re-weighted according to this likelihood ratio. This is
possible if the solution of the stochastic differential equation is uniformly
integrable, a property that can be determined by comparing the corresponding
factual and counterfactual short-term predictions. Local independence graphs
are directed, possibly cyclic, graphs that represent short-term prediction
among sufficiently autonomous stochastic processes. We show through an example
that these graphs can be used to identify and provide consistent estimators for
counterfactual parameters in continuous time. This is analogous to how Judea
Pearl uses graphical information to identify causal effects in finite state

quantum particle motion using probe nanotechnologies have revealed the
necessity of revising previous concepts of their motion. Particularly, quantum
particles transfer quantum motion nonlocality energy beside classical kinetic
energy, in other words, they are in two different kinds of motion
simultaneously. The quantum component of the motion energy may be quite
considerable under certain circumstances. Some new effects were predicted and
proved experimentally in terms of this phenomenon. A new prototype
refrigerating device was tested, its principle of operation being based on the
effect of transferring the quantum component of the motion energy.

characteristic Halpha and beta Zeeman triplets. Using VLT X-shooter spectra we
measured a surface-averaged magnetic field B_S ~ 0.5 MG. The relative intensity
of the pi and sigma components of the calcium and hydrogen lines imply a high
inclination (i > 60 deg). The optical-to-infrared V-J colour index and the
CaI/CaII ionization balance indicate a temperature between 4900 and 5200 K,
while the Balmer line profiles favour a higher temperature of 5400 K. The
discrepancy is potentially resolved by increasing the metallicity to 0.03x
solar, hence increasing the electron pressure. However, the measured calcium
abundance and abundance upper limits for other elements (Na, Al, Si. and Fe)
imply a low photospheric metallicity < 10^{-4} solar. Assuming diffusion
steady-state, a calcium accretion rate of log(dM/dt)(g/s)=5.6+/-0.3 is required

of the $\qbar\gamma^i{\tau}q$ and $\qbar\sigma^{0i}{\tau}q$ interpolators to a
given meson state at different resolution scales tells one about the degree of
chiral symmetry breaking in the meson wave function at these scales. Using a
Gaussian gauge invariant smearing of the quark fields in the interpolators, we
are able to extract the chiral content of mesons up to the infrared resolution
of ~1 fm. In the ground state rho meson the chiral symmetry is strongly broken
with comparable contributions of both the (0,1) + (1,0) and (1/2,1/2)_b chiral
representations with the former being the leading contribution. In contrast, in
the rho' meson the degree of chiral symmetry breaking is manifestly smaller and
the leading representation is (1/2,1/2)_b. Using a unitary transformation from
the chiral basis to the {2S +1}L_J basis, we are able to define and measure the
angular momentum content of mesons in the rest frame. This definition is
different from the traditional one which uses parton distributions in the
infinite momentum frame. The rho meson is practically a 3S_1 state with no
obvious trace of a ""spin crisis"". The rho' meson has a sizeable contribution of
the 3D_1 wave, which implies that the rho' meson cannot be considered as a pure

early asymptotic giant branch stars and central red giant branch stars can be
measured, and used to derive the mass loss between these two phases. This can
then be used as a physical check of models of horizontal branch (HB) stars. For
omega Cen, the average difference is found to be 26 +/- 4%. Assuming initial
and final masses of 0.83 and 0.53 solar masses, we determine that 0.21 +/- 0.03
solar masses is lost on the RGB and 0.09 +/- ~0.05 solar masses is lost on the
AGB. The implied HB stellar mass of 0.62 +/- 0.04 solar masses is commensurate
with literature determinations of the masses of the cluster's HB stars. The
accuracy of this measurement can be improved through better selection of stars
and spectral coverage, and applied to other clusters where horizontal branch
models do not currently agree.

with n vertices and no edges. Now at each time k, choose 2 vertices uniformly
at random and attach an edge between these two vertices. Let \bfG_n(k) be the
graph obtained at step k. Refined analysis in random graph theory now shows
that for fixed t\in \Rbold, when k(n) = n/2+ n^{2/3} t/2, the sizes of the
components in \bfG_n(k(n)) scale like n^{2/3} and rescaled component sizes
converge to the standard multiplicative coalescent at time $t$. The last decade
has seen variants of this process introduced, under the name Achlioptas
processes, to understand the effect of simple changes in the edge formation
scheme on the emergence of the giant component. Stimulated by a question of
Achlioptas, one of the simplest and most popular of such models is the Bohman
Frieze (BF) model wherein at each stage $k$, 2 edges e_1(k)=(v_1,v_2) and
e_2(k) = (v_3, v_4) are chosen uniformly at random. If at this time v_1, v_2
are both isolated then this edge is added, otherwise e_2 is added. Then
\cite{bohman2001avoiding} (and further analysis in \cite{spencer2007birth})
show that once again there is a critical parameter, which is larger than 1,
above and below which the asymptotic behavior is as in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
setting. While an intense study for this and related models seems to suggest
that at criticality, this model should be in the same universality class as the
original Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi process, a precise mathematical treatment of the
dynamics in the critical window has to date escaped analysis. In this work we
study the component structure of the BF model in the critical window and show

Background (CMB) fluctuations enable us to probe the physics of the very early
Universe especially at the epoch of inflation. A particular interest lays on
the detection of the non-Gaussianity of the CMB as it can constrain the current
proposed models of inflation and structure formation, or possibly point out new
models. The current approach to measure the degree of non-Gaussianity of the
CMB is to estimate a single parameter which is highly model-dependent. The
bispectrum is a natural and widely studied tool for measuring the
non-Gaussianity in a model-independent way. This paper sets the grounds for a
full CMB bispectrum estimator based on the decomposition of the sphere onto
projected patches. The mean bispectrum estimated this way can be calculated
quickly and is model-independent. This approach is very flexible, allowing
exclusion of some patches in the processing or consideration of just a specific
region of the sphere.

types in the theory of topological groups and theirs actions on compacts

spaces for amenability. We observe that a Polish group is amenable if and only
if its every continuous action on the Hilbert cube admits an invariant
probability measure. This generalizes a result of Bogatyi and Fedorchuk. We
also show that actions on the Cantor space can be used to detect amenability
and extreme amenability of Polish non-archimedean groups as well as amenability
at infinity of discrete countable groups. As corollary, the latter property can
also be tested by actions on the Hilbert cube. These results generalise a
criterion due to Giordano and de la Harpe. In the second part of this thesis we
are motivated by the problem of existence of an universal topological group of
uncountable weight. We show that the group of isometries of a universal
Urysohn-Katetov metric space of uncountable density is not a universal group of
the corresponding weight. For instance, it does not contain the group of
isometries of the classical separable Urysohn metric space. This stands in
sharp contrast with Uspenskij's 1990 result about the group of isometries of
the classical separable Urysohn metric space being a universal Polish group.

The intensities of different lines were taken to construct a multivariate

transformation of multi characteristic line intensities according to the
physical mechanisms of lased induced plasma spectrum were made, combined with
linear-correlation-based PLS method, to model the nonlinear self-absorption and
inter-element interference effects. This enables the linear PLS method to
describe non-linear relationship more accurately and provides the
statistics-based PLS method with physical backgrounds. Moreover, a secondary
PLS is applied utilizing the whole spectra information to further correct the
model results. Experiments were conducted using standard brass samples. Taylor
expansion was applied to make the nonlinear transformation to describe the
self-absorption effect of Cu. Then, line intensities of another two elements,
Pb and Zn, were taken into account for inter-element interference. The proposed
method shows a significant improvement when compared with conventional PLS
model. Results also show that, even compared with the already-improved baseline
dominant-factor-based PLS model, the present PLS model based on the
multivariate dominant factor yields the same calibration quality (R2=0.999)

be the most important ones: by assuming that the pressure Hessian is local in

correlated with the true pressure Hessian both in terms of eigenvalue
magnitudes and eigenvector alignments.

It is well-known that each pseudo-Boolean function $f$ can be written as
$f(x)=\sum_{I\in {\cal F}}\hat{f}(I)\chi_I(x),$ where ${\cal F}\subseteq \{I:\
I\subseteq [n]\}$, $[n]=\{1,2,...,n\}$, and $\chi_I(x)=\prod_{i\in I}x_i$ and
$\hat{f}(I)$ are non-zero reals. The degree of $f$ is $\max \{|I|:\ I\in {\cal

$\mathbf{x}_i$ be a random variable taking values 1 or -1 uniformly and
independently from all other variables $\mathbf{x}_j$, $j\neq i.$ Let
$\mathbf{x}=(\mathbf{x}_1,...,\mathbf{x}_n)$. The $p$-norm of $f$ is

well-known that $||f||_q\ge ||f||_p$ whenever $q> p\ge 1$. However, the higher

depending on $f$: if $f$ is of degree $d$ and $q> p>1$ then $ ||f||_q\le
(\frac{q-1}{p-1})^{d/2}||f||_p.$ This inequality is called the Hypercontractive

((2r)!\rho^{r-1})^{1/(2r)}||f||_p,$ where $r=\lceil q/2\rceil$. For the case
$q=4$ and $p=2$, which is important in many applications, we prove a stronger

extended, metal-poor population with a flattish velocity dispersion profile,
and a more concentrated, metal-rich population with a velocity dispersion
declining with radius. The two populations can be modelled with Michie-King
distribution functions (DFs) in the isothermal and in the sharply truncated
limits, respectively. We argue that the truncation of the metal-rich population
can be traced back to the spatial distribution of the star forming gas. Suppose
D is the exponent of the first non-constant term in the Taylor expansion of the
total potential at the center (D=1 for NFW halos, D=2 for cored halos). Then,
we show that the ratio of the half-light radii of the populations raised to the
D/2 power must be smaller than the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity
dispersions. Specialising to the case of the Sculptor dSph, we develop a
technique to fit simultaneously both populations with Michie-King DFs. This
enables us to determine the mass profile of the Sculptor dSph with
unprecedented accuracy in the radial range between 0.2 and 1.2 kpc. We show
that cored halo models are preferred over cusped halo models, with a likelihood
ratio test rejecting NFW models at any significance level higher than 0.05%.
Even more worryingly, the best-fit NFW models require concentrations with c<20,
which is not in the cosmologically preferred range for dwarf galaxies. We
conclude that the kinematics of multiple populations in dSphs provides a
substantial new challenge for theories of galaxy formation, with the weight of
available evidence strongly against dark matter cusps at the centre.

Several
descriptions exist for the evolution of the shower size along the atmospheric
depth. The well known functions for shower profiles, Greisen, Gaisser-Hillas

approximate solutions of versions of the Rossi and Greisen diffusion equations.
The mathematical connection will be demonstrated by means of two simple models
for the longitudinal electromagnetic shower profile. Both models can be
regarded either as a generalization of the Heitler model or as a simplification
of the diffusion model of Rossi and Greisen. These models are far closer to
reality than the Heitler model, while they are not as close to reality as the
model of Rossi and Greisen. Therefore, they will be referred to as intermediate
models. For each intermediate model the evolution of the shower is governed by
either a single differential equation or a single integro-differential
equation. The approximate solution of the differential equation is a
Gaisser-Hillas function and can be adjusted such that it almost matches the
Greisen profile. The approximate solution of the integro-differential equation
is a `Gaussian in Age' function. The corresponding profile is, after suitable
adjustment, in excellent agreement with the Greisen profile. The analysis also
leads to an alternative functional form for the age parameter.

fractals and chaos by means of cities. Especially, a principle of space filling
and spatial replacement is proposed to explain the fractal dimension of urban
form. The fractal dimension evolution of urban growth can be empirically
modeled with Boltzmann's equation. For the normalized data, Boltzmann's
equation is equivalent to the logistic function. The logistic equation can be
transformed into the well-known 1-dimensional logistic map, which is based on a
2-dimensional map suggesting spatial replacement dynamics of city development.
The 2-dimensional recurrence relations can be employed to generate the
nonlinear dynamical behaviors such as bifurcation and chaos. A discovery is
made that, for the fractal dimension growth following the logistic curve, the
normalized dimension value is the ratio of space filling. If the rate of
spatial replacement (urban growth) is too high, the periodic oscillations and
chaos will arise, and the city system will fall into disorder. The spatial
replacement dynamics can be extended to general replacement dynamics, and
bifurcation and chaos seem to be related with some kind of replacement process.

particular, we critically investigate recent claims that the M-sigma relation
only represents the upper limit to a broad distribution of black-hole masses in
galaxies of a given velocity dispersion. We find that this hypothesis can be
rejected at a high confidence level, at least for the early-type galaxies with
relatively high velocity dispersions (median 268 km/s) that comprise most of
our sample. We also describe a general procedure for incorporating
observational selection effects in estimates of the properties of the M-sigma

earlier estimates that did not account for selection effects, although with
larger error bars. In particular, (i) the width of the M-sigma relation is not
significantly increased; (ii) the slope and normalization of the M-sigma

them from their single-gap counterparts. The calculational degree of complexity
increases only slightly with respect to the conventional Ginzburg-Landau
expansion, thus the extended Ginzburg-Landau model remains numerically far less
demanding compared to the full microscopic approaches.

there exists a cause and effect relation between the vertical tidal M1

physical model mechanism is postulated that justifies the obtained results. It
is shown that the tidal waves can trigger a large EQ, despite their small
amplitude, provided that the seismogenic area is under critical stress load
conditions. Actually, it is shown that a large EQ can be triggered by the
cooperative action of all vertical tidal components but mainly by the M1 and K1
ones. Examples are presented from the most recent global large EQs (Summatra,

Hamiltonians on a lattice in D spatial dimensions. Different types of tensor
network states can be seen to generate different geometries. Matrix product
states (MPS) in D=1 dimensions, as well as projected entangled pair states
(PEPS) in D>1 dimensions, reproduce the D-dimensional physical geometry of the
lattice model; in contrast, the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz
(MERA) generates a (D+1)-dimensional holographic geometry. Here we focus on
homogeneous tensor networks, where all the tensors in the network are copies of
the same tensor, and argue that certain structural properties of the resulting
many-body states are preconditioned by the geometry of the tensor network and
are therefore largely independent of the choice of variational parameters.
Indeed, the asymptotic decay of correlations in homogeneous MPS and MERA for
D=1 systems is seen to be determined by the structure of geodesics in the
physical and holographic geometries, respectively; whereas the asymptotic
scaling of entanglement entropy is seen to always obey a simple boundary law --
that is, again in the relevant geometry. This geometrical interpretation offers
a simple and unifying framework to understand the structural properties of, and
helps clarify the relation between, different tensor network states. In
addition, it has recently motivated the branching MERA, a generalization of the
MERA capable of reproducing violations of the entropic boundary law in D>1
dimensions.

Oxidation to only 200 mV does not form such extra NEXAFS feature, supporting
that a critical electrochemical potential between 200 and 600 mV is necessary

Ea of bulk and grain boundary conductivity from two perovskites synthesized by

At high temperature, the bulk activation energy increases with pressure by 5%

between the activation energy at 1.0 GPa and > 1.2 GPa. The grain boundary
activation energy is around a factor two times as that of the bulk, and it

essential for GW-like calculations to obtain the full spectral information. The

a better spectral description of the plasmon peak and side-band peaks in

angles. This indicates a second dust grain population preferably forward
scattering and smaller in size. It shows that, relatively, in the inner disk
regions (40-50 AU) a higher fraction of larger grains is found compared to the
outer disk regions (100-110 AU). Finally, our images reveal distinct
substructures between 25-35 AU physical separation from the star and we discuss
the possible origin for the two features in the context of ongoing planet
formation.

the formation and evolution of aspherical planetary nebulae, however
observational support for this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we present the most
recent results of a continuing programme to model the morphologies of all
planetary nebulae known to host a close binary central star. Initially, this
programme allows us to compare the inclination of the nebular symmetry axis to
that of the binary plane, testing the theoretical expectation that they will
lie perpendicular - to date, all have satisfied this expectation, indicating
that each nebula has been shaped by its central binary star. As a greater
sample of nebulae are modelled, it will be possible to search for trends
connecting the parameters of both nebula and central binary, strengthening our
understanding of the processes at work in these objects. I will discuss some of
the more obvious comparisons, and their current statuses, as well as the
obvious links to common envelope evolution.

Supergravity at least in some energy regimes. The currently most advanced
description of Quantum Supergravity and beyond is Superstring Theory/M-Theory
in 10/11 dimensions. String Theory is a top-to-bottom approach to Quantum
Supergravity in that it postulates a new object, the string, from which
classical Supergravity emerges as a low energy limit. On the other hand, one
may try more traditional bottom-to-top routes and apply the techniques of
Quantum Field Theory. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is a manifestly background
independent and non-perturbative approach to the quantisation of classical
General Relativity, however, so far mostly without supersymmetry. The main
obstacle to the extension of the techniques of LQG to the quantisation of
higher dimensional Supergravity is that LQG rests on a specific connection
formulation of General Relativity which exists only in D+1 = 4 dimensions. In
this Letter we introduce a new connection formulation of General Relativity
which exists in all space-time dimensions. We show that all LQG techniques
developed in D+1 = 4 can be transferred to the new variables in all dimensions
and describe how they can be generalised to the new types of fields that appear
in Supergravity theories as compared to standard matter, specifically
Rarita-Schwinger and p-form gauge fields.

time-one map of an identity isotopy on a closed oriented surface with genus
$g\geq1$. In symplectic geometry, a classical object is the notion of action
function, defined on the set of contractible fixed points of the time-one map
of a Hamiltonian isotopy. We give a dynamical interpretation of this function
that permits us to generalize it in the case of a homeomorphism isotopic to
identity that preserves a Borel finite measure of rotation vector zero,
provided that a boundedness condition is satisfied. We give some properties of
the generalized action. In particular, we generalize a result of Schwarz
[Pacific J. Math.,2000] about the action function being non-constant which has
been proved by using Floer homology. As applications, we generalize some
results of Polterovich [Invent. Math.,2002] about the symplectic and
Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms groups on closed oriented surfaces being distortion
free, which permits us to give an alternative proof of the $C^1$-version of the
Zimmer conjecture on closed oriented surfaces.

size and increasing complexity operate on a tight energy budget. Thus, energy
consumption is becoming one of the major concerns regarding the current and
upcoming wireless communication systems. On the other hand, the available
bandwidth resources are limited and modern applications are throughput
demanding, leading thus to strong competition for the medium. In this
direction, we consider a stochastic contention based medium access scheme,
where the devices may choose to turn off for some time in order to save energy.
We perform an analysis for a slotted ALOHA scenario and we show that the energy
constraints, if properly exploited, may reduce contention for the medium. Our
results give valuable insights on the energy--throughput tradeoff for any
contention based system.
