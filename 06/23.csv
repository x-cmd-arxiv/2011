discovery rate provide an achieved error rate as the adjusted p-value for each
hypothesis tested. However, since such p-values are not probabilities that the
null hypotheses are true, empirical Bayes methods have been devised to estimate
such posterior probabilities, called local false discovery rates (LFDRs) to
emphasize the frequency interpretation of their priors. The main approaches to
LFDR estimation, relying either on numerical algorithms to maximize likelihood
or on the selection of smoothing parameters for nonparametric density
estimation, lack the automatic nature of the methods of error rate control. To
begin filling the gap, this paper introduces automatic methods of LFDR
estimation with proven asymptotic conservatism under the independence of
p-values but without strong parametric assumptions. Simulations indicate that
they remain conservative even for very small numbers of hypotheses. One of the
proposed procedures enables interpreting the original FDR control rule in terms
of LFDR estimation, thereby facilitating practical interpretation. The most
conservative of the new procedures is applied to measured abundance levels of
20 proteins.

We find significant differences between models with and without stellar
rotation, and between models from different authors. More specifically, we find
that the main ingredients in the formation of structures in the Wolf-Rayet wind
bubbles are the duration of the Red Supergiant (or Luminous Blue Variable)
phase, the amount of mass lost, and the wind velocity during this phase, in
agreement with previous authors. Thermal conduction is also included in our
models. We find that main-sequence bubbles with thermal conduction are slightly
smaller, due to extra cooling which reduces the pressure in the hot, shocked
bubble, but that thermal conduction does not appear to significantly influence
the formation of structures in post-main-sequence bubbles. Finally, we study
the predicted X-ray emission from the models and compare our results with
observations of the Wolf-Rayet bubbles S\,308, NGC\,6888, and RCW\,58. We find
that bubbles composed primarily of clumps have reduced X-ray luminosity and
very soft spectra, while bubbles with shells correspond more closely to

modular random graphs and on graphs based on actual, interdependent power
grids. Starting from two isolated networks, adding some connectivity between
them is beneficial, for it suppresses the largest cascades in each system. Too
much interconnectivity, however, becomes detrimental for two reasons. First,
interconnections open pathways for neighboring networks to inflict large
cascades. Second, as in real infrastructure, new interconnections increase
capacity and total possible load, which fuels even larger cascades. Using a
multitype branching process and simulations we show these effects and estimate
the optimal level of interconnectivity that balances their tradeoffs. Such
equilibria could allow, for example, power grid owners to minimize the largest
cascades in their grid. We also show that asymmetric capacity among
interdependent networks affects the optimal connectivity that each prefers and
may lead to an arms race for greater capacity. Our multitype branching process
framework provides building blocks for better prediction of cascading processes
on modular random graphs and on multi-type networks in general.

weakly coupled AdS particles, in one-to-one correspondence with
minimal-color-singlet CFT primary operators. If all but a finite number of
""protected"" primary operators have very large scaling dimensions, it is shown
that there exists a low-AdS-curvature effective field theory regime for the
corresponding finite set of AdS particles. Effective 5D gauge theory and
General Relativity on AdS are derived in this way from the most robust examples
of protected CFT primaries, Noether currents of global symmetries and the
energy-momentum tensor. Witten's prescription for computing CFT local operator
correlators within the AdS dual is derived. The main new contribution is the
derivation of 5D locality of AdS couplings. This is accomplished by studying a
confining IR-deformation of the CFT in the large-N ""planar"" approximation,
where the discrete spectrum and existence of an S-matrix allow the constraints
of unitarity and crossing symmetry to be solved (in standard fashion) by a
tree-level expansion in terms of 4D local ""glueball"" couplings. When the
deformation is carefully removed, this 4D locality (with plausible technical
assumptions specifying its precise nature) combines with the restored conformal
symmetry to yield 5D AdS locality. The sense in which AdS/CFT duality
illustrates the possibility of emergent relativity, and the special role of
strong coupling, are briefly discussed. Care is taken to conclude each step

assumptions to be reconstructed. Our main objective is to analyze the multiple
parameters of the image reconstruction process with particular attention to the
regularization term and the study of their behavior in different situations.
The secondary goal is to derive practical rules for the users. Using the
Multi-aperture image Reconstruction Algorithm (MiRA), we performed multiple
systematic tests, analyzing 11 regularization terms commonly used. The tests
are made on different astrophysical objects, different (u,v) plane coverages
and several signal-to-noise ratios to determine the minimal configuration
needed to reconstruct an image. We establish a methodology and we introduce the
mean-square errors (MSE) to discuss the results. From the ~24000 simulations
performed for the benchmarking of image reconstruction with MiRA, we are able
to classify the different regularizations in the context of the observations.
We find typical values of the regularization weight. A minimal (u,v) coverage
is required to reconstruct an acceptable image, whereas no limits are found for
the studied values of the signal-to-noise ratio. We also show that
super-resolution can be achieved with increasing performance with the (u,v)
coverage filling. Using image reconstruction with a sufficient (u,v) coverage
is shown to be reliable. The choice of the main parameters of the
reconstruction is tightly constrained. We recommend that efforts to develop

non-linear boundaries for the ring restore gauge invariance but lead
unexpectedly to eigenfunctions with a continuous eigenvalue spectrum, a
discreet subset of which forms a Hilbert space with energy bands. This Hilbert
space maintains the principle of superposition of eigenfunctions despite the
nonlinearity. The momentum operator remains Hermitian. If physical reality
requires gauge invariance, it would appear that quantum mechanics should
incorporate these nonlinear boundary conditions.

gravitational wave propagation in the linearized approximation of general
relativity. In this approximation we consider the situation where the metric
can be written as $g_{\mu\nu}= \eta_{\mu\nu}+ h_{\mu\nu}^\Lambda +
h_{\mu\nu}^W$, $h_{\mu\nu}^{\Lambda,W}<< 1$, where $h_{\mu\nu}^{\Lambda}$ is
the background perturbation and $h_{\mu\nu}^{W}$ is a modification
interpretable as a gravitational wave. For $\Lambda \neq 0$ this linearization
of Einstein equations is self-consistent only in certain coordinate systems.
The cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates do not belong to this
class and the derived linearized solutions have to be reinterpreted in a
coordinate system that is homogeneous and isotropic to make contact with
observations. Plane waves in the linear theory acquire modifications of order
$\sqrt{\Lambda}$, both in the amplitude and the phase, when considered in FRW
coordinates. In the linearization process for $h_{\mu\nu}$, we have also
included terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda h_{\mu\nu})$. For the background
perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}^\Lambda$ the difference is very small but when the
term $h_{\mu\nu}^{W}\Lambda$ is retained the equations of motion can be
interpreted as describing massive spin-2 particles. However, the extra degrees
of freedom can be approximately gauged away, coupling to matter sources with a
strength proportional to the cosmological constant itself. Finally we discuss
the viability of detecting the modifications caused by the cosmological
constant on the amplitude and phase of gravitational waves. In some cases the
distortion with respect to gravitational waves propagating in Minkowski
space-time is considerable. The effect of $\Lambda$ could have a detectable
impact on pulsar timing arrays.

may be explained by a power law for the growth costs of hyphal expansion on a
microscopic scale. The information about the response of the fungal mycelium on
a microscopic scale to environmental conditions is essential to simulate its
behavior in complex structure substrates such as wood, where the impact of the
fungus to the wood (i.e. the degradation of bordered pits or the creation of
bore holes and cavities) changes the local environmental condition, e.g. the
permeability of the substrate and therefore the water activity level in a
colonized wood cell lumen. A combination of diffusion and moisture processes
into wood with the FGM may brighten the knowledge about the colonization
strategy of P. vitreus and helps to optimize its growth behavior for

heavy mesons and excited meson states into three light pseudoscalar mesons. The
model accounts for the three-mesons final state interactions in the decay
processes, as required by both the three-body and two-body unitarity
conditions. In the absence of the Z-diagram mechanisms that are necessary
consequences of the three-body unitarity, our decay amplitudes are reduced to a
form similar to those used in the so-called isobar-model analysis. We apply our
coupled-channels model to the three-pions decays of a1(1260), pi2(1670),
pi2(2100), and D0 mesons, and show that the Z-diagram mechanisms can contribute
to the calculated Dalitz plot distributions by as much as 30% in magnitudes in
the regions where f0(600), rho(770), and f2(1270) dominate the distributions.
Also, by fitting to the same Dalitz plot distributions, we demonstrate that the
decay amplitudes obtained with the unitary model and the isobar model can be
rather different, particularly in the phase that plays a crucial role in
extracting the CKM CP-violating phase from the data of B meson decays. Our
results indicate that the commonly used isobar model analysis must be extended
to account for the final state interactions required by the three-body
unitarity to reanalyze the three-mesons decays of heavy mesons, thereby
exploring hybrid or exotic mesons, and signatures of physics beyond the
standard model.

compare various nanofullerene materials proposed theoretically as storage
medium for hydrogen. Doping of transition elements leads to clustering which
reduces the gravimetric density of hydrogen, while doping of alkali and
alkali-earth metals on the nanocage materials, such as carborides, boronitride,
and boron cages, were stabilized by the charger transfer from the dopant to the
nanocage. Further, the alkali or alkali-earth elements exist with a charge,

dipole- dipole and change-induced dipole interaction. The binding energies of
hydrogen on these systems were found to be in the range of 0.1 eV to 0.2 eV,

phase diagram as well as the critical properties of two dimensional classical
statistical mechanics models and quantum Hamiltonians in one dimension. The
most used method to locate quantum critical points is the so called crossing
method, where the estimates are obtained by comparing the mass gaps of two
distinct lattice sizes. The success of this method is due to its simplicity and
the ability to provide accurate results even considering relatively small
lattice sizes. In this paper, we introduce an estimator that locates quantum
critical points by exploring the known distinct behavior of the entanglement
entropy in critical and non critical systems. As a benchmark test, we use this
new estimator to locate the critical point of the quantum Ising chain and the
critical line of the spin-1 Blume-Capel quantum chain. The tricritical point of
this last model is also obtained. Comparison with the standard crossing method
is also presented. The method we propose is simple to implement in practice,
particularly in density matrix renormalization group calculations, and provides
us, like the crossing method, amazingly accurate results for quite small
lattice sizes. Our applications show that the proposed method has several
advantages, as compared with the standard crossing method, and we believe it
will become popular in future numerical studies.

ambient toric varieties are given in terms of fans over the facets of reflexive
lattice polytopes. The program performs crepant star triangulations of
reflexive polytopes and determines the Mori cones of the resulting toric
varieties. Furthermore, it computes the intersection rings and characteristic
classes of hypersurfaces.

transformation is thermodynamically limited by very high activation energy
(\sim 7 eV in fullerene), which can get reduced due to the presence of
hydrogen, extra carbon atom, or due to endohedral metal doping. Using
first-principles density functional calculations, we show that the
substitutional boron doping substantially reduces the Stone-Wales activation
barrier (from \sim 7 eV to 2.54 eV). This reduction is the largest in magnitude
among all the mechanisms of barrier reduction reported till date. Analysis of
bonding charge density and phonon frequencies suggests that the bond weakening
at and around the active Stone-Wales site in B-heterofullerene is responsible
for such reduction. The formation of Stone-Wales defect is, therefore, promoted
in such heterofullerenes, and is expected to affect their proposed H2 storage
properties. Such substitutional doping can also modify the Stone-Wales
activation barrier in carbon nanotube and graphene naonostructures, and
catalyze isomerization, fusion, and nanowelding processes.

an approximate analytical expression, valid at zero temperature and weak

distinct departure from ionization equilibrium in that the abundances of Fe I

alpha-element ratios are enhanced to 0.4 (RGB) and 0.3 dex (TO), respectively,
and we also confirm strong variations in the O, Na, and Al/Fe abundance ratios.
Accordingly, the light-element abundance patterns in one of the red giants can
be attributed to pollution by an early generation of massive SNe II. TO and RGB
abundances are not significantly different, with the possible exception of Mg
and Ti, which is, however, amplified by the patterns in one TO star,

NMSSM, Higgs portals etc., the lightness of these new states ensures their
large transverse momenta and, as a consequence, the collinearity of their decay

easily be missed by standard analysis techniques, can be superbly exploited in
an analysis based on subjet observables. When combined with additional
selection strategies, this analysis can even facilitate an early discovery of
the Higgs boson. To be specific, a light Higgs can be found with $S/\sqrt{B}

than focus on one or more stable dark-matter particles, we instead consider a
multi-component framework in which the dark matter of the universe comprises a
vast ensemble of interacting fields with a variety of different masses,
mixings, and abundances. Moreover, rather than impose stability for each field
individually, we ensure the phenomenological viability of such a scenario by
requiring that those states with larger masses and Standard-Model decay widths
have correspondingly smaller relic abundances, and vice versa. In other words,
dark-matter stability is not an absolute requirement in such a framework, but
is balanced against abundance. This leads to a highly dynamical scenario in
which cosmological quantities such as Omega_{CDM} experience non-trivial
time-dependences beyond those associated with the expansion of the universe.
Although it may seem difficult to arrange an ensemble of states which have the
required decay widths and relic abundances, we present one particular example
in which this balancing act occurs naturally: an infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein
(KK) states living in the bulk of large extra spacetime dimensions. Remarkably,
this remains true even if the stability of the KK tower itself is entirely
unprotected. Thus theories with large extra dimensions --- and by extension,
certain limits of string theory --- naturally give rise to dynamical dark
matter. Such scenarios also generically give rise to a rich set of collider and
astrophysical phenomena which transcend those usually associated with dark
matter.

indicates that model parameters are correctly tuned, giving accurate values of
the main properties of galaxies for further use in our study. In the present
work, we perform a statistical analysis of the relative contribution to the
stellar mass and metallicity of galaxies along the CMR by the different
processes involved in their formation and evolution (i.e. quiescent star
formation, disc instability events and galaxy mergers). Our results show that a
mix of minor and major dry mergers at low redshifts is relevant in the
evolution of the most luminous galaxies in the CMR. These processes contribute
with low metallicity stars to the remnant galaxies, thus increasing the galaxy
masses without significantly altering their colours. These results are found
for all simulated clusters, supporting the idea of the universality of the CMR

gas-rich interactions produces larger metal dilutions factors which are
afterward modulated by the new chemical production by Supernova. We find that
the more gas-rich interaction develops violent and clumpy star formation
triggered by local instabilities all over the disc before the first pericentre,
so that if these galaxies were observed at these early stages where no
important tidally-induced inflows have been able to develop yet, they would

examples often must be limited due to the costs associated with procuring,
preparing, and storing the training examples and/or the computational costs
associated with learning from them. In such circumstances, one question of
practical importance is: if only n training examples can be selected, in what
proportion should the classes be represented? In this article we help to answer
this question by analyzing, for a fixed training-set size, the relationship
between the class distribution of the training data and the performance of
classification trees induced from these data. We study twenty-six data sets
and, for each, determine the best class distribution for learning. The
naturally occurring class distribution is shown to generally perform well when
classifier performance is evaluated using undifferentiated error rate (0/1
loss). However, when the area under the ROC curve is used to evaluate
classifier performance, a balanced distribution is shown to perform well. Since
neither of these choices for class distribution always generates the
best-performing classifier, we introduce a budget-sensitive progressive
sampling algorithm for selecting training examples based on the class
associated with each example. An empirical analysis of this algorithm shows
that the class distribution of the resulting training set yields classifiers
with good (nearly-optimal) classification performance.

  We use extensive Monte-Carlo simulations to define the optimal strategy for
the recovery of the dark-energy equation of state using the high redshift (z~2)
Hubble relation, but accounting also for the effects of gravitational lensing,
which for such high redshifts can significantly affect the derived cosmological
constraints. Based on a ""Figure of Merit"" analysis, we provide estimates for
the number of 2<z<3.5 tracers needed to reduce the cosmological solution space,
presently provided by the Constitution SNIa set, by a desired factor. We find
that it is much more efficient to increase the number of tracers than to reduce
their individual uncertainties.
  Finally, we propose a framework to put constraints on the dark energy
equation of state by using the joint likelihood of the X-ray AGN clustering and
of the Hubble relation cosmological analyses. A preliminary joint analysis
using the X-ray AGN clustering of the 2XMM survey and the Hubble relation of
the Constitution SNIa set provide: Omega_m= 0.31+-0.01 and w=-1.06+-0.05. We
also find that the joint SNIa-2XMM analysis provides significantly more

~2, with respect to that of the joint SNIa-BAO analysis.

central regions of the clusters, we are still able to measure up to 30-100
supergiant stars in each of the richest clusters, along with the brighter main
sequence stars. The resulting CMDs and luminosity functions are compared with
photometry of artificially generated clusters, designed to reproduce the
photometric errors and completeness as realistically as possible. In agreement
with previous studies, our CMDs show no clear gap between the H-burning main
sequence and the He-burning supergiant stars, contrary to predictions by common
stellar isochrones. In general, the isochrones also fail to match the observed
number ratios of red-to-blue supergiant stars, although the difficulty of
separating blue supergiants from the main sequence complicates this comparison.
In several cases we observe a large spread (1-2 mag) in the luminosities of the
supergiant stars that cannot be accounted for by observational errors. This
spread can be reproduced by including an age spread of 10-30 million years in

Remarkably, the measured halo power spectrum in redshift space exhibits a

the effect becomes significant for the massive or highly biased halo samples.
These findings cannot be simply explained by the so-called streaming model
frequently used in the literature. By contrast, a physically-motivated
perturbation theory model developed in the previous paper reproduces the halo
power spectrum very well, and the model combining a simple linear
scale-dependent bias can accurately characterize the clustering anisotropies of

The results highlight the significance of non-linear coupling between density

the subject of debate in recent years, between ""evolutionary"" models (where
clusters can evolve from CC to NCC, mainly through mergers) and ""primordial""
models (where the state of the cluster is fixed ""ab initio"" by early mergers or
pre-heating). We found that in a well-defined sample (clusters in the GMRT
Radio halo survey with available Chandra or XMM-Newton data), none of the
objects hosting a giant radio halo can be classified as a cool core. This
result suggests that the main mechanisms which can start a large scale
synchrotron emission (most likely mergers) are the same that can destroy CC and
therefore strongly supports ""evolutionary"" models of the CC-NCC dichotomy.
Moreover combining the number of objects in the CC and NCC state with the
number of objects with and without a radio-halo, we estimated that the time
scale over which a NCC cluster relaxes to the CC state, should be larger than
the typical life-time of radio-halos and likely shorter than about 3 Gyr. This
suggests that NCC transform into CC more rapidly than predicted from the
cooling time, which is about 10 Gyr in NCC systems, allowing the possibility of
a cyclical evolution between the CC and NCC states.

smaller than that from dark matter pair-annihilation. However, if dark matter
particles cannot pair-annihilate, as is the case for example in asymmetric dark
matter scenarios, cosmic-ray scattering with final state photon emission
provides a unique window to detect a signal from dark matter with gamma rays.
We estimate the expected flux level and its spectral features for a generic
supersymmetric setup, and we also discuss dipolar and luminous dark matter. We
show that in some cases the gamma-ray emission might be large enough to be
detectable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope.

the losses in overall performance. To provide a tool for use by multiagent
researchers in evaluating this tradeoff, we present a unified framework, the
COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem (COM-MTDP). The COM-MTDP model
combines and extends existing multiagent theories, such as decentralized
partially observable Markov decision processes and economic team theory. In
addition to their generality of representation, COM-MTDPs also support the
analysis of both the optimality of team performance and the computational
complexity of the agents' decision problem. In analyzing complexity, we present
a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing optimal teams under
various classes of problem domains, along the dimensions of observability and
communication cost. In analyzing optimality, we exploit the COM-MTDP's ability
to encode existing teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of
joint intentions theory taken from the literature. Furthermore, the COM-MTDP
model provides a basis for the development of novel team coordination
algorithms. We derive a domain-independent criterion for optimal communication
and provide a comparative analysis of the two joint intentions instantiations
with respect to this optimal policy. We have implemented a reusable,
domain-independent software package based on COM-MTDPs to analyze teamwork
coordination strategies, and we demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating

introduce competitive safety analysis. This approach bridges the gap between
the desired normative AI approach, where a strategy should be selected in order
to guarantee a desired payoff, and equilibrium analysis. We show that a safety
level strategy is able to guarantee the value obtained in a Nash equilibrium,
in several classical computer science settings. Then, we discuss the concept of
competitive safety strategies, and illustrate its use in a decentralized load
balancing setting, typical to network problems. In particular, we show that
when we have many agents, it is possible to guarantee an expected payoff which
is a factor of 8/9 of the payoff obtained in a Nash equilibrium. Our discussion
of competitive safety analysis for decentralized load balancing is further
developed to deal with many communication links and arbitrary speeds. Finally,
we discuss the extension of the above concepts to Bayesian games, and

autonomy, transferring decision-making control to other entities (typically
agents transferring control to human users) in key situations. Determining
whether and when such transfers-of-control should occur is arguably the
fundamental research problem in adjustable autonomy. Previous work has
investigated various approaches to addressing this problem but has often
focused on individual agent-human interactions. Unfortunately, domains
requiring collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key
shortcomings of these previous approaches. First, these approaches use rigid
one-shot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable coordination
failures in multiagent settings. Second, they ignore costs (e.g., in terms of
time delays or effects on actions) to an agent's team due to such
transfers-of-control. To remedy these problems, this article presents a novel
approach to adjustable autonomy, based on the notion of a transfer-of-control
strategy. A transfer-of-control strategy consists of a conditional sequence of
two types of actions: (i) actions to transfer decision-making control (e.g.,
from an agent to a user or vice versa) and (ii) actions to change an agent's
pre-specified coordination constraints with team members, aimed at minimizing
miscoordination costs. The goal is for high-quality individual decisions to be
made with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team. We present a
mathematical model of transfer-of-control strategies. The model guides and
informs the operationalization of the strategies using Markov Decision
Processes, which select an optimal strategy, given an uncertain environment and
costs to the individuals and teams. The approach has been carefully evaluated,
including via its use in a real-world, deployed multi-agent system that assists
a research group in its daily activities.

of $N$ queues; after completion of service at its queue, a job leaves the
network. We also assume that jobs arrive into the system according to a
rate-$\alpha N$ Poisson process, $\alpha<1$, with rate-1 service at each queue.
When the service at queues is exponentially distributed, it was shown in
Vvedenskaya et al. [Probl. Inf. Transm. 32 (1996) 15-29] that the tail of the
equilibrium queue size decays doubly exponentially in the limit as
$N\rightarrow\infty$. This is a substantial improvement over the case D=1,
where the queue size decays exponentially. The reasoning in [Probl. Inf.
Transm. 32 (1996) 15-29] does not easily generalize to jobs with nonexponential
service time distributions. A modularized program for treating general service
time distributions was introduced in Bramson et al. [In Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS
(2010) 275-286]. The program relies on an ansatz that asserts, in equilibrium,
any fixed number of queues become independent of one another as
$N\rightarrow\infty$. This ansatz was demonstrated in several settings in
Bramson et al. [Queueing Syst. 71 (2012) 247-292], including for networks where
the service discipline is FIFO and the service time distribution has a
decreasing hazard rate. In this article, we investigate the limiting behavior,
as $N\rightarrow \infty$, of the equilibrium at a queue when the service
discipline is FIFO and the service time distribution has a power law with a
given exponent $-\beta$, for $\beta>1$. We show under the above ansatz that, as
$N\rightarrow\infty$, the tail of the equilibrium queue size exhibits a wide
range of behavior depending on the relationship between $\beta$ and $D$. In
particular, if $\beta>D/(D-1)$, the tail is doubly exponential and, if
$\beta<D/(D-1)$, the tail has a power law. When $\beta=D/(D-1)$, the tail is
exponentially distributed.

yields poly(1/epsilon)-time property testing algorithms for membership in these
classes of graphs. Another application of the oracle is a poly(1/epsilon)-time
algorithm that approximates the maximum matching size, the minimum vertex cover
size, and the minimum dominating set size up to an additive epsilon*n in graphs
with bounded treewidth. Finally, the oracle can be used to test in
poly(1/epsilon) time whether the input bounded-treewidth graph is k-colorable
or perfect.

  Non-Rigid Shape Analysis and Deformable Image Alignment (in conjunction with

of (3-dimensional) shapes, and extensively used in biological morphometrics.
Typically each (normalized) shape is represented by N landmark points, chosen
to be homologous (i.e. corresponding to each other), as far as possible, and
the Procrustes distance is then computed as the infimum, over all Euclidean
transformations R, of the sum of the squared Euclidean distances between R x_j
and x'_j, and the correspondences x_j <-> x'_j are picked in an optimal way.
The discrete Procrustes distance has the drawback that each shape is
represented by only a finite number of points, which may not capture all the
geometric aspects of interest; a need has been expressed for alternatives that
are still easy to compute. We propose in this paper the concept of continuous
Procrustes distance, and prove that it provides a true metric for
two-dimensional surfaces embedded in three dimensions. The continuous
Procrustes distance leads to a hard optimization problem over the group of
area-preserving diffeomorphisms. One of the core observations of our paper is
that for small continuous Procrustes distances, the global optimum of the
Procrustes distance can be uniformly approximated by a conformal map. This
observation leads to an efficient algorithm to calculate approximations to this
new distance.

were performed from 2007 October to 2008 January. The campaign represents the
first contemporaneous data on the object at very high energy (VHE, E >100 GeV)
{\gamma}-ray, X-ray, and UV energies. Observations with VERITAS in VHE
{\gamma}-rays yield a strong detection of 20 {\sigma} with 633 excess events in
a total exposure of 18.1 hours live-time. A strong VHE {\gamma}-ray flare on
2007 December 7 is measured at F(>300 GeV) = (6.76 \pm 0.62) \times 10-11 ph
cm-2 s-1, corresponding to 48% of the Crab Nebula flux. Excluding this flaring
episode, nightly variability at lower fluxes is observed with a time-averaged
mean of F(>300 GeV) = (1.06 \pm 0.09) \times 10-11 ph cm-2 s-1 (7.6% of the
Crab Nebula flux). The differential photon spectrum between 390 GeV and 8.3 TeV
for the time-averaged observations excluding 2007 December 7 is well described
by a power law with a photon index of {\Gamma} = 2.78 \pm 0.09stat \pm
0.15syst. Over the full period of VERITAS observations contemporaneous X-ray
and UV data were taken with Swift and RXTE. The measured 2-10 keV flux ranged
by a factor of ~7 during the campaign. On 2007 December 8 the highest ever
observed X-ray flux from 1ES 2344+514 was measured by Swift XRT at a flux of
F(2-10 keV) = (6.28 \pm 0.31) \times 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1. Evidence for a
correlation between the X-ray flux and VHE {\gamma}-ray flux on nightly
time-scales is indicated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.60 \pm
0.11. Contemporaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 1ES 2344+514 are
presented for two distinct flux states. A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) model describes both SEDs using parameters consistent with previous SSC
modeling of 1ES 2344+514 from non-contemporaneous observations.

two different states, namely, the large magnetization (LM) and small

emerges with warming from the LT helimagnetic phase. The weak ferromagnetism
along the b-axis and the unusual temperature hysteresis in the IT phase can be
understood by assuming a spontaneous formation of the stripe structure

regardless of the electron angular momentum. The original scalar Schrodinger
Hamiltonian operator is factored into vector ""charge"" operators: Q and

staggered magnetic fields in two dimensions (2D). To mimic real materials, we
consider a system of coupled, antiferromagnetic chains, whose interchain
interaction can be either ferro- or antiferromagnetic. When the staggered field
is commensurate with the magnetic interactions, an energy gap opens immediately
and follows a power law as a function of the applied field, similar to the
situation in 1D. When the field competes with the interactions, a quantum phase
transition (QPT) occurs from a gapless, magnetically ordered phase at low
fields to a gapped, disordered regime. We use a continuous-time Monte Carlo
method to compute the staggered moment of the ordered phases and the spin gap
of the disordered phases. We deduce the phase diagrams as functions of the
anisotropy ratio and the applied field, and calculate the scaling behavior of
the models in both quantities. We show that in the competitive case, the
staggered field acts to maintain a regime of quasi-1D behavior around the QPT,
and we discuss as a consequence the nature of the crossover from 1D to 2D
physics.

systems confined to a 20 nm-wide, (311)A GaAs quantum well. The holes in this
system occupy two nearly-degenerate spin subbands whose $m^{*}$ we measure to
be $\sim $ 0.2 (in units of the free electron mass). Despite the relatively
large $r_{s}$ in our 2D system, the measured $m^{*}$ is in good agreement with
the results of our energy band calculations which do not take interactions into
account. We hen apply a sufficiently strong parallel magnetic field to fully
depopulate one of the spin subbands, and measure $m^{*}$ for the populated
subband. We find that this latter $m^{*}$ is surprisingly close to the $m^{*}$
we measure in the absence of the parallel field. We also deduce the spin
susceptibility of the 2D hole system from the depopulation field, and conclude
that the susceptibility is enhanced by about 50% relative to the value expected
from the band calculations.

distribution of dark matter is modeled as an ensemble of smooth, universal,
rigid, disjoint, spherical halos with distribution and universal properties
constrained by simulation data. We apply this formalism to theories of dark
matter with p-wave annihilation, for which the relative-velocity-weighted
annihilation cross section is \sigma v=a+bv^2. We determine that this
significantly increases the gamma-ray power if b/a >> 10^6. The effect of
p-wave annihilation on the angular power spectrum is very similar for the
sample of particle physics models we explored, suggesting that the important
effect for a given b/a is largely determined by the cosmic dark matter
distribution. If the dark matter relic from strong p-wave theories is thermally
produced, the intensities of annihilation gamma-rays are strongly p-wave
suppressed, making them difficult to observe. If an angular power spectrum
consistent with a strong p-wave were to be observed, it would likely indicate
non-thermal production of dark matter in the early Universe.

free energy barrier for forming a droplet of the liquid phase from the
metastable gas phase for a model colloidal fluid exhibiting competing
interactions. The pair potential has a hard core of diameter {\sigma}, is
attractive Yukawa at intermediate separations, and is repulsive Yukawa at large
separations. We find that even a very weak long-range repulsive tail in the
pair potential has a profound effect on nucleation: increasing the amplitude of
the repulsive Yukawa tail reduces significantly the free energy barrier height
and therefore increases the liquid droplet nucleation rate. The method we
introduce for calculating the droplet density profile and free energy employs a
fictitious external potential to stabilize a liquid droplet of the desired
size, i.e. with a given excess number of particles. For the critical droplet,
corresponding to an extremum of the grand potential, this fictitious potential
is everywhere zero. We examine the decay of the droplet density profiles into
the bulk gas. For a range of nucleation state points the DFT predicts
exponentially damped, long wavelength oscillatory decay for systems exhibiting
long-range repulsion, contrasting sharply with the monotonic decay found when
the pair potential has only an attractive Yukawa piece. The changes in
nucleation properties that we find for small amplitudes of the repulsive Yukawa
tail reflect the propensity of the fluid to form modulated structures such as
clusters or stripes.

in four and five dimensional gravity (S. Vacaru, IJGMMP 4 (2007) 1285). In this
letter, we prove that such a geometric method can be used for constructing
general non-Killing solutions. The key idea is to introduce an auxiliary linear
connection which is also metric compatible and completely defined by the metric
structure but contains some torsion terms induced nonholonomically by generic
off-diagonal coefficients of metric. There are some classes of nonholonomic
frames with respect to which the Einstein equations (for such an auxiliary
connection) split into an integrable system of partial differential equations.
We have to impose additional constraints on generating and integration
functions in order to transform the auxiliary connection into the Levi-Civita
one. This way, we extract general exact solutions (parametrized by generic
off-diagonal metrics and depending on all coordinates) in Einstein gravity and
five dimensional extensions.

small scale structure have been observed and reported in a previous paper, as
well as the fact that the previously observed loop that mediates the second
intercommutation is only a loop for sufficiently large beta =
m_scalar^2/m_gauge^2. Here we give a more detailed account of our study,
involving 3D numerical simulations with beta in the range 1 to 64, the largest
value simulated to date, as well as 2D simulations of vortex-antivortex (v-av)
collisions to understand the possible relation to the new 3D phenomena. Our
simulations give further support to the idea that Abelian Higgs strings never
pass through each other, unless this is the result of a double reconnection;
and that the critical velocity (v_c) for double reconnection goes down with
increasing mass ratio, but energy conservation suggests a lower bound around
0.77c. We discuss the qualitative change in the intermediate state observed for
large mass ratios. We relate it to a similar change in the outcome of 2D v-av
collisions in the form of radiating bound states. In the deep type-II regime
the angular dependence of v_c for double reconnection does not seem to conform
to semi-analytic predictions based on the Nambu-Goto approximation. We model
the high angle collisions reasonably well by incorporating the effect of core
interactions, and the torque they produce on the approaching strings, into the
Nambu-Goto description of the collision. An interesting, counterintuitive
aspect is that the effective collision angle is smaller because of the torque.
Our results suggest differences in network evolution and radiation output with

dynamics.

simulations of the interaction of the relativistic proto-magnetar wind with a
surrounding 10^-1 10^-3 M_\odot envelope, which represents material ejected
during the merger; the supernova following AIC; or via outflows from the
accretion disk. The collision between the relativistic magnetar wind and the
expanding ejecta produces a magnetized nebula inside the ejecta. A strong
toroidal magnetic field builds up in the nebula, which drives a bipolar jet out
through the ejecta, similar to the magnetar model developed in the case of long
duration GRBs. We quantify the `break-out' time and opening angle of the jet
theta_j as a function of the wind energy flux dot{E} and ejecta mass M_ej. We
show that dot{E} and theta_j are inversely correlated, such that the
beaming-corrected (isotropic) luminosity of the jet is primarily a function of
M_ej. Both variability arguments, and the lower limit on the power of magnetar
outflows capable of producing bright emission, suggest that the true opening
angle of the magnetar jet must be relatively large. The model thus predicts a
class of events for which the EE is observable with no associated short GRB.
These may appear as long-duration GRBs or X-Ray Flashes, which may be detected

optical counterpart. We have analysed all RXTE observations since its
discovery, archived optical spectroscopic and photometric data and obtained for
the first time near-IR spectra. The K-band spectrum shows HeI 20581 A and HI
21660 A (Brackett-gamma) in emission, which confine the spectral type of the
companion to be earlier than B2.5. The H-band spectrum exhibits the HI Br-18-11
recombination series in emission. The most prominent feature of the optical
band spectrum is the strong emission of the Balmer line Halpha. The 4000-5000 A
spectrum contains HeII and numerous HeI ines in absorption, indicating an early
B-type star. The source shows three consecutive stages characterised by
different types of variability in the X-ray band: a smooth decay after the peak
of a large outburst, large-amplitude flaring variability (reminiscent of type I
oytbursts) and quiescence. We observed that the spectrum becomes softer as the
flux decreases and that this is a common characteristic of the X-ray emission
for all observing epochs. An emission line feature at ~6.5 keV is also always
present. The X-ray/optical/IR continuum and spectral features are typical of an
accreting X-ray pulsar with an early-type donor. The long-term X-ray

SWIFT J1626.6-5156 is a Be/X-ray binary with a B0Ve companion located at a

superfluid stiffness and membrane bending modulus, we derive conditions under
which the quantum buckling instability occurs. An ansatz for the resulting

analyzed through a 2D finite element thermo-mechanical model. Oceanic slab
dehydration and consequent mantle wedge hydration are implemented using a
dynamic method. Hydration is accomplished by lawsonite and serpentine
breakdown; topography is treated as a free surface. Subduction rates of 1, 3,
5, 7.5 and 10 cm/y, slab angles of 30o, 45o and 60o and a mantle rheology
represented by dry dunite and dry olivine flow laws, have been taken into
account during successive numerical experiments. Model predictions pointed out
that a direct relationship exists between mantle rheology and the amount of
recycled crustal material: the larger the viscosity contrast between hydrated
and dry mantle, the larger the percentage of recycled material into the mantle
wedge. Slab dip variation has a moderate impact on the recycling. Metamorphic
evolution of recycled material is influenced by subduction style. TPmax,
generally representative of eclogite facies conditions, is sensitive to changes
in slab dip. A direct relationship between subduction rate and exhumation rate
results for different slab dips that does not depend on the used mantle flow
law. Thermal regimes predicted by different numerical models are compared to PT
paths followed by continental crustal slices involved in ancient and recent
subduction zones, making ablative subduction a suitable pre-collisional
mechanism for burial and exhumation of continental crust.

located at the depth of the 1600 K isotherm. Numerical simulations were
performed while taking into account four different initial thicknesses for the
oceanic lithosphere (60, 80, 95 and 110 km) and five different thicknesses of
the overriding plate, as compared in terms of the continental-oceanic plate
thickness ratio (100, 120, 140, 160 and 200% of the oceanic lithosphere
thickness). The results of numerical modeling indicate that a high variability
of the subducting plate geometry occurs for an oceanic lithosphere thickness
ranging from 60 to 80 km, while the variability decreases where the oceanic
plates are thicker (95 and 110 km). Furthermore, the slab dip strongly depends
on the thermal state of the overriding plate, and, in particular, the slab dip
decreases with the increase in the upper plate thickness. The model predictions
also confirm that a direct correlation between the slab dip and the age of the
oceanic lithosphere does not exist, at least for subduction plates thinner that
110 km. These conclusions are supported by the good agreement between the model
results and the natural data referring to worldwide ocean-continent subduction

due to the limited spatial resolution but due to the narrowly defined test

Physics-based disambiguation methods, adapted for solar magnetic fields
extending to infinity, are not designed to handle such data; hence, they could
only fail this test. I demonstrate how an appropriate limited-resolution

magnetogram very similar to that of Leka et al. (2009) but representing a

additional three fields cover the northwestern (NW) side of the galaxy along

stellar populations are found in all fields out to 120' (~ 30 kpc), while a
diffuse population of young stars (~ 200 Myr) is detected out to a
galactocentric radius of 15 kpc. The mean metallicity in the southern fields
remains approximately constant at [M/H] = -0.7 beyond the edge of the optical
disc, from 40' out to 80'. Along the northern fields probing the outer \hi
disc, we also find a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.7 between 35' and 70' from the

the northernmost field, outside the disc extent, the stellar population of the
large stellar feature possibly related to a M33-M31 interaction is on average
more metal-poor ([M/H] = -1.3) and older (> 6 Gyr). An exponential disc with a

the nonlocal correlations are small, and the DMFT paramagnetic solution is in

if confirmed, would imply a large annihilation scenario in the QCD
factorization approach. This is somewhat unexpected as the large annihilation
scenario was disfavored in previous studies. In this paper we reinvestigate the
role of annihilation topology in QCD factorization. We find that it is not easy
to reach the CDF central value of $B_s \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ decays when other decay
channels are considered. Our analysis also reveals that, for well-measured
charmless B decays into two final pseudoscalar mesons, the QCD factorization
predictions with large annihilation parameters show good agreement with the
experimental data except $B_s \to K^+ K^-$ and $B_d \to K^0 \bar{K}^0$ decays.
Though other possibilities can not be excluded, this may indicate that the
SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking should be taken into account for the
annihilation topology. In addition, there are different annihilation
topologies, so that somewhat different annihilation parameters may be chosen
for different final states and different annihilation topologies. If so, the
predictive power of the QCD factorization method may be rather limited for many
decay channels.

self-obscured by very dense, dusty stellar winds. An explosive transient with
an un-observed shock break-out luminosity of order 10^10 Lsun is required to
render the transients little obscured and visible in the optical at their
peaks. Such a large break-out luminosity then implies that the progenitor stars
were cool, red supergiants, most probably ~9 Msun extreme AGB (EAGB) stars. As
the shocks generated by the explosions propagate outward through the dense
wind, they produce a shock luminosity in soft X-rays that powers the long-lived
luminosity of the transients. Unlike typical cases of transients exploding into
a surrounding circumstellar medium, the progenitor winds in these systems are
optically thick to soft X-rays, easily absorb radio emission and rapidly reform
dust destroyed by the peak luminosity of the transients. As a result, X-rays
are absorbed by the gas and the energy is ultimately radiated by the reformed
dust. Three years post-peak, both systems are still significantly more luminous
than their progenitor stars, but they are again fully shrouded by the re-formed
dust and only visible in the mid-IR. The high luminosity and heavy obscuration
may make it difficult to determine the survival of the progenitor stars for ~10
years. However, our model indicates that SN2008S, but not the NGC300-OT, should
now be a detectable X-ray source. SN2008S has a higher estimated shock velocity
and a lower density wind, so the X-rays begin to escape at a much earlier
phase.

have been successfully applied to machine learning tasks that involve

two-sample homogeneity test. However, since density-ratio functions often
possess high fluctuation, divergence estimation is still a challenging task in
practice. In this paper, we propose to use relative divergences for
distribution comparison, which involves approximation of relative
density-ratios. Since relative density-ratios are always smoother than
corresponding ordinary density-ratios, our proposed method is favorable in
terms of the non-parametric convergence speed. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed divergence estimator has asymptotic variance independent of the model
complexity under a parametric setup, implying that the proposed estimator
hardly overfits even with complex models. Through experiments, we demonstrate
the usefulness of the proposed approach.

observed white dwarf-main sequence post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs). We
apply multi-regression analysis in order to investigate whether correlations
exist between the CE ejection efficiencies, alpha_CE, inferred from the sample,
and the binary parameters: white dwarf mass, secondary mass, orbital period at
the point the CE commences, or the orbital period immediately after the CE
phase. We do this with and without consideration for the internal energy of the
progenitor primary giants' envelope. Our fits should pave the first steps
towards an observationally motivated recipe for calculating alpha_CE using the
binary parameters at the start of the CE phase, which will be useful for
population synthesis calculations or models of compact binary evolution. If we
do consider the internal energy of the giants' envelope, we find a
statistically significant correlation between alpha_CE and the white dwarf
mass. If we do not, a correlation is found between alpha_CE and the orbital
period at the point the CE phase commences. Furthermore, if the internal energy
of the progenitor primary envelope is taken into account, then the CE ejection
efficiencies are within the canonical range 0<alpha_CE<=1, although PCEBs with
brown dwarf secondaries still require alpha_CE>=1.

closed curve. Unique feature of this method, unlike other perturbation schemes,
is that it does not require a separate formalism to treat degeneracies.
Degenerate states are handled equally elegantly as the non-degenerate ones. A
real parameter, extracted from the parameters defining the irregular boundary,
serves as a perturbation parameter in this scheme as opposed to earlier schemes
where the perturbation parameter is an artificial one. The efficacy of the
proposed scheme is gauged by calculating the eigenvalues for elliptical and
supercircular boundaries and comparing with the results obtained numerically.
We also present a simple and interesting semi-empirical formula, determining
the eigenspectrum of the 2D Helmholtz equation with the Dirichlet or the
Neumann condition for a supercircular boundary. A comparison of the
eigenspectrum for several low-lying modes obtained by employing the formula
with the corresponding numerical estimates shows good agreement for a wide

paper, we present a model in a 2D interacting spin system with nontrivial
on-site $Z_2$ symmetry protected topological order. The order is nontrivial
because we can prove that the 1D system on the boundary must be gapless if the
symmetry is not broken, which generalizes the gaplessness of Wess-Zumino-Witten
model for Lie symmetry groups to any discrete symmetry groups. The construction
of this model is related to a nontrivial 3-cocycle of the $Z_2$ group and can
be generalized to any symmetry group. It potentially leads to a complete
classification of symmetry protected topological orders in interacting boson
and fermion systems of any dimension. Specifically, this exactly solvable model
has a unique gapped ground state on any closed manifold and gapless excitations
on the boundary if $Z_2$ symmetry is not broken. We prove the latter by
developing the tool of matrix product unitary operator to study the nonlocal
symmetry transformation on the boundary and revealing the nontrivial 3-cocycle
structure of this transformation. Similar ideas are used to construct a 2D

M 31 has been completely imaged for the first time obtaining a
luminosity lower limit ~10^35 erg s-1 in the 0.2-4.5 keV band. Our XMM-Newton
EPIC survey combines archival observations with observations taken between June
2006 and February 2008. The main goal of the paper is a study of the X-ray
source population of M 31. Methods. An X-ray catalogue of 1897 sources was
created; 914 were detected for the first time. Source classification and
identification were based on X-ray hardness ratios, spatial extent of the
sources, and by cross correlating with catalogues in the X-ray, optical,
infrared and radio wavelengths. We also analysed the long-term variability of
the X-ray sources. Results. Fourteen of the 30 supersoft source candidates
represent supersoft emission of optical novae. Many of the 25 supernova
remnants (SNRs) and 31 SNR candidates lie within the 10 kpc dust ring and other
star forming regions in M 31; this connection between SNRs and star forming
regions implies that most of the remnants originate in type II supernovae. The
brightest sources in X-rays in M 31 belong to the class of X-ray binaries
(XRBs). Ten low mass XRBs (LMXBs) and 26 LMXB candidates were identified based
on their temporal variability. In addition 36 LMXBs and 17 LMXB candidates were
identified due to correlations with globular clusters and globular cluster
candidates. From optical and X-ray colour-colour diagrams, possible high mass
XRB (HMXB) candidates were selected. Two of these candidates have an X-ray
spectrum as is expected for an HMXB containing a neutron star primary.
Conclusions. While our survey has greatly improved our understanding of the
X-ray source populations in M 31, at this point 65% of the sources can still
only be classified as ""hard"" sources. Deeper observations in X-ray and at other
wavelengths would help classify these sources. ABRIDGED
