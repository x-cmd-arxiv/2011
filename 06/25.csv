incorporates an X-junction, while maintaining the ions near the motional
ground-state of the confining potential well. We expand on the first report of
the experiment [1], including a detailed discussion of how the transport
potentials were calculated. Two main mechanisms that caused motional excitation
during transport are explained, along with the methods used to mitigate such
excitation. We reduced the motional excitation below the results in Ref. [1] by
a factor of approximately 50. The effect of a mu-metal shield on qubit
coherence is also reported. Finally, we examined a method for exchanging energy
between multiple motional modes on the few-quanta level, which could be useful
for cooling motional modes without directly accessing the modes with lasers.
These results establish how trapped ions can be transported in a large-scale
quantum processor with high fidelity.

magnetic field maps are manipulated directly. Throughout, statistical
comparisons of the degraded maps with the originals serve to quantify the
outcomes. Overall, we find that areas with inferred magnetic fill fractions
close to unity may be insensitive to optical spatial resolution; areas of
sub-unity fill fractions are very sensitive. Trends with worsening spatial
resolution can include increased average field strength, lower total flux, and
a field vector oriented closer to the line of sight. Further-derived quantities
such as vertical current density show variations even in areas of high average
magnetic fill-fraction. In short, unresolved maps fail to represent the
distribution of the underlying unresolved fields, and the ""post-facto"" methods
generally do not reproduce the effects of a smaller telescope aperture. It is
argued that selecting a method in order to reconcile disparate spatial
resolution effects should depend on the goal, as one method may better preserve
the field distribution, while another can reproduce spatial resolution
degradation. The results presented should help direct future inter-instrument

both stellar types to the integrated flux of distant metal-poor galaxies. The
equivalent SAGE survey of the higher-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud

production. We find that the SMC RSG stars are less likely to produce a large
amount of dust (as indicated by the [3.6]-[8] color). There is a higher
fraction of carbon-rich stars in the SMC, and these stars appear to able to
reach colors as red as their LMC counterparts, indicating that C-rich dust
forms efficiently in both galaxies. A preliminary estimate of the dust
production in AGB and RSG stars reveals that the extreme C-rich AGB stars
dominate the dust input in both galaxies, and that the O-rich stars may play a
larger role in the LMC than in the SMC.

three charge states of interstitial hydrogen in Yttria. The present
calculations were carried out by employing the GGA-PBE and the HSE06
exchange-correlation functional. It is observed that the ground state H$^0$ and
H$^-$ configurations are similar in behaviour; these prefer to relax in the O
vacant site, with limited structural relaxation. For the neutral and the
negative charged systems more two different geometrical configurations occur
with higher energies, which evidence the existence of metastable sites of H in
the Yttria lattice. The H$^+$ equilibrium state is found only when a strong
bond between the impurity ion and an anion, O-H bond of $\sim$1 \AA, is formed.
The formation energy of the interstitial impurity is studied, for which
amphoteric behaviour is found for this defect and for the ground state
structures. These results evidence that hydrogen counteracts the prevailing
conductivity of the host lattice, thus passivating any existing electrical
levels originated from other doping sources. To compare results with
non-equilibrium and short time-scale $\mu$SR measurements, the formation energy
of the higher energy configurations were also evaluated. For the Bond O
geometrical site, H evidences a donor-dopant behaviour, hence enabling the
coexistence of donor behaviour with the ground-state amphoteric behaviour. From
the density of states results, and for the H$^0$ and H$^-$ charge states, a
defect level was observed in the band gap. For the ground state Vacant O
configuration and the metastable Interstitial structure the defect level was
found to be slightly above the valence band maximum, hence indicating no
dopant-donor character for the Yttria material. But, for the Bond O,
local-minimum, configuration, the defect level is located above the middle of
the band gap, closer the conduction band.

to the enrichment of the interstellar medium in dust and molecules. The
physical mechanism of this mass loss is however relatively poorly known.
Betelgeuse is the nearest RSG, and as such a prime object for high angular
resolution observations of its surface (by interferometry) and close
circumstellar environment. Aims: The goal of our program is to understand how
the material expelled from Betelgeuse is transported from its surface to the
interstellar medium, and how it evolves chemically in this process. Methods: We
obtained diffraction-limited images of Betelgeuse and a PSF calibrator
(Aldebaran) in six filters in the N band (7.76 to 12.81 mic) and two filters in
the Q band (17.65 and 19.50 mic), using the VLT/VISIR instrument. Results: Our
images show a bright, extended and complex circumstellar envelope at all
wavelengths. It is particularly prominent longwards of 9-10 mic, pointing at
the presence of O-rich dust, such as silicates or alumina. A partial circular
shell is observed between 0.5 and 1.0"" from the star, and could correspond to
the inner radius of the dust envelope. Several knots and filamentary structures
are identified in the nebula, one of the knots, located at a distance of 0.9""
west of the star, being particularly bright and compact. Conclusions: The
circumstellar envelope around Betelgeuse extends at least up to several tens of
stellar radii. Its relatively high degree of clumpiness indicates an
inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the material lost by the star. Its
extension corresponds to an important intermediate scale, where most of the
dust is probably formed, between the hot and compact gaseous envelope observed
previously in the near infrared and the interstellar medium.

environment for the LambdaCDM and wCDM paradigms. It is argued that the baryons
do not necessarily follow into the dark matter potential wells after they are
released from the drag of the photons. The baryonic evolution equations inherit
a forcing term whose explicit form depends on the plasma description and can be
deduced, for instance, in the resistive magnetohydrodynamical approximation.
After deriving an analytical expression for the growth rate applicable when
dark energy does not cluster, the effects of relativistic corrections and of
the inhomogeneities associated with the other species of the plasma are taken
into account numerically. The spectral amplitudes and slopes of the stochastic
magnetic background are selected to avoid appreciable distortions in the
measured temperature and polarization anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave
Background. The growth of structures in the current paradigms of structure
formation represents a complementary probe of large-scale magnetism in the same
way as the shape of the growth factor and the associated indices can be used,
in the conventional lore, to discriminate between competing scenarios of dark
energy or even to distinguish different models of gravity.

demonstrated that a stellar-dynamical operator exists, which uniquely
transforms an initial orbital parameter distribution function for binaries into
a new distribution depending on the initial cluster mass and half-mass radius,
after some time of dynamical evolution. For the initial distribution the
distribution functions derived by Kroupa (1995a,b) are used, which are
consistent with constraints for pre-main sequence and Class I binary

of N-body models it is found that the binary populations change their
properties on a crossing time-scale such that the stellar dynamical operator
can be well parametrized as a function of the initial cluster density.
Furthermore it is shown that the binary-fraction in clusters with similar
initial velocity dispersions follows the same evolutionary tracks as a function
of the passed number of relaxation-times. Present-day observed binary
populations in star clusters put constraints on their initial stellar densities
which are found to be in the range 10^2 - 2x10^5 M_sun pc^-3 for open clusters
and a few x 10^3 - 10^8 M_sun pc^-3 for globular clusters, respectively.

unusually large optical depth of ~5 at 100 microns. Non-LTE modeling of the CO
shows two temperature components: cold molecular gas at T ~ 50 K and warm
molecular gas at T ~1350 K. The mass of the warm gas is 10% of the cold gas,
but dominates the luminosity of the CO ladder. The temperature of the warm gas
is in excellent agreement with H2 rotational lines. At 1350 K, H2 dominates the

radiative corrections to the b and \tau Yukawa couplings, and the possibility

that heating events occur rapidly enough to keep high temperature active region
loops close to equilibrium. In this paper, we couple observations of Active
Region 10955 made with XRT and EIS on \textit{Hinode} to test a simple steady
heating model. First we calculate the differential emission measure of the apex
region of the loops in the active region core. We find the DEM to be broad and
peaked around 3\,MK. We then determine the densities in the corresponding
footpoint regions. Using potential field extrapolations to approximate the loop
lengths and the density-sensitive line ratios to infer the magnitude of the
heating, we build a steady heating model for the active region core and find
that we can match the general properties of the observed DEM for the
temperature range of 6.3 $<$ Log T $<$ 6.7. This model, for the first time,
accounts for the base pressure, loop length, and distribution of apex
temperatures of the core loops. We find that the density-sensitive spectral
line intensities and the bulk of the hot emission in the active region core are
consistent with steady heating. We also find, however, that the steady heating
model cannot address the emission observed at lower temperatures. This emission
may be due to foreground or background structures, or may indicate that the
heating in the core is more complicated. Different heating scenarios must be

to a projected radius of approximately 30 kpc. Our ground-based data were
combined with archival and published Hubble Space Telescope data to probe the
properties of the GC system close to the galaxy center and reduce contamination
in the GC candidate sample from foreground stars and background galaxies. We
performed surface photometry of NGC 7457 and compared the galaxy's surface
brightness profile with the surface density profile of the GC system. The
profiles have similar shapes in the inner 1 arcminute (3.9 kpc), but the GC
system profile appears to flatten relative to the galaxy light at larger radii.
The GC system of NGC 7457 is noticeably elliptical in our images; we measure an
ellipticity of 0.66 +/- 0.14 for the GC distribution, which is consistent with
our measured ellipticity of the galaxy light. We integrated the radial surface
density profile of the GC system to derive a total number of GCs N_GC = 210 +/-
30. The GC specific frequency normalized by the galaxy luminosity and mass are
S_N = 3.1 +/- 0.7 and T = 4.8 +/- 1.1, respectively. Comparing the derived GC

their tensor spectra: inflation predicts a red tilt ($n_T<0$), string gases and
loop quantum cosmology predict a blue tilt ($n_T>0$), while a nonsingular

binary systems by using Lyapunov exponents and power spectra for the special
case of the circular restricted 3-body problem (CR3BP). The centerpiece of our
method is the concept of Lyapunov exponents, which are incorporated into the
analysis of orbital stability by integrating the Jacobian of the CR3BP and
orthogonalizing the tangent vectors via a well-established algorithm originally
developed by Wolf et al. The criterion for orbital stability based on the
Lyapunov exponents is independently verified by using power spectra. The
obtained results are compared to results presented in the two previous papers
of this series. It is shown that the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be used as
an indicator for chaotic behaviour of planetary orbits, which is consistent
with previous applications of this method, particularly studies for the Solar
System. The chaotic behaviour corresponds to either orbital stability or
instability, and it depends solely on the mass ratio of the binary components
and the initial distance ratio of the planet relative to the stellar separation
distance. Our theoretical results allow us to link the study of planetary
orbital stability to chaos theory noting that there is a large array of
literature on the properties and significance of Lyapunov exponents. Although
our results are given for the special case of the CR3BP, we expect that it may
be possible to augment the proposed Lyapunov exponent criterion to studies of
planets in generalized stellar binary systems, which is strongly motivated by
existing observational results as well as results expected from ongoing and
future planet search missions.

popularity in recent years, due to the growing societal awareness of reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and gaining independence on foreign oil or
petroleum. Large-scale deployment of PEVs currently faces many challenges. One
particular concern is that the PEV charging can potentially cause significant
impacts on the existing power distribution system, due to the increase in peak
load. As such, this work tries to mitigate the impacts of PEV charging by
proposing a decentralized smart PEV charging algorithm to minimize the
distribution system load variance, so that a `flat' total load profile can be
obtained. The charging algorithm is myopic, in that it controls the PEV
charging processes in each time slot based entirely on the current power system
states, without knowledge about future system dynamics. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the asymptotic optimality of the proposed charging algorithm.
Thus, compared to other forecast based smart charging approaches in the
literature, the charging algorithm not only achieves optimality asymptotically
in an on-line, and decentralized manner, but also is robust against various
uncertainties in the power system, such as random PEV driving patterns and
distributed generation (DG) with highly intermittent renewable energy sources.

III, and to compare the results to our recent survey of Cha I. We used the
Large APEX Bolometer Array (LABOCA) to map Cha III in dust continuum emission
at 870 micron. 29 sources are extracted from the map, all of them being
starless. The starless cores are found down to a visual extinction of 1.9 mag,
in marked contrast with other molecular clouds, including Cha I. Apart from
this difference, the Cha III starless cores share very similar properties with
those found in Cha I. At most two sources have a mass larger than the critical
Bonnor-Ebert mass, which suggests that the fraction of prestellar cores is very
low, even lower than in Cha I. Only the most massive sources are candidate
prestellar cores, in agreement with the correlation found earlier in the Pipe
nebula. The mass distribution of the 85 starless cores of Cha I and III that
are not candidate prestellar cores is consistent with a single power law down
to the 90% completeness limit, with an exponent close to the Salpeter value. A
fraction of the starless cores in Cha I and III may still grow in mass and
become gravitationally unstable. Based on predictions of numerical simulations
of turbulent molecular clouds, we estimate that at most 50% and 20% of the
starless cores of Cha I and III, respectively, may form stars. The LABOCA
survey reveals that Cha III, and Cha I to some extent too, is a prime target to
study the formation of prestellar cores, and thus the onset of star formation.

Constrained random walks of n steps in Rd are obtained from the latter walks by
imposing that the sum of the step lengths is equal to a fixed value. When the
latter is chosen, without loss of generality, to be equal to 1, then the
constrained step lengths have a Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are all
equal to q. The density of the endpoint position of a n- step planar walk of

1+floor(n/2) endpoint densities of planar Pearson-Dirichlet walks with q=1

space dimension and any number of steps n\geq2 when the parameter of the

mixture of 1+floor(n/2) densities with simple forms, equivalently expressed as
a product of a power and a Gauss hypergeometric function. The weights are
products of factors which depend both on d and n and Bessel numbers independent

difficult to measure the top quark forward-backward asymmetry. To improve the

quarks produced from quarks and those from gluons: the invariant mass of the
top pair, the rapidity of the top-antitop system in the lab frame, the rapidity
of the top quark in the top-antitop rest frame, the top quark polarization and
the top-antitop spin correlation. We combine all the variables in a likelihood
discriminant method to separate quark-initiated events from gluon-initiated

motivated by the recent observation of a large top quark forward-backward

of the asymmetry increase by 40% to 100%. We have also analytically derived the
best spin quantization axes for studying top quark polarization as well as

fibril embedded in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. The scattering is
mediated through the excitation of slow sausage waves on the magnetic tube, and
only the scattering of the monopole component of the wavefield is considered.
Since such tube waves are not confined by the acoustic cavity and may freely
propagate along the field lines removing energy from the acoustic wavefield,
the excitation of fibril oscillations is a source of acoustic wave absorption
as well as scattering. We compute the mode mixing that is achieved and the
absorption coefficients and phase shifts. We find that for thin tubes the mode
mixing is weak and the absorption coefficient is small and is a smooth function
of frequency over the physically relevant band of observed frequencies. The
prominent absorption resonances seen in previous studies of unstratified tubes
are absent. Despite the relatively small absorption, the phase shift induced
can be surprisingly large, reaching values as high as 15 degree for f modes.
Further, the phase shift can be positive or negative depending on the incident
mode order and the frequency.

reminiscent of the final AGB outflow history of the central star, so far as
these have not yet been transformed by the hot wind and radiation of the
central star. Obviously, the evolution of the mass loss rate of that
dust-driven, cool wind of the former giant in its final AGB stages must have
shaped these envelopes to some extent. Less clear is the impact of changes in
the outflow velocity. Certainly, larger and fast changes would lead to
significant complications in the reconstruction of the mass-loss history from a
cool envelope's density profile.
  Here, we analyse the outflow velocity v_{\rm exp} in a consistent set of over
50 carbon-rich, dust-driven and well ""saturated"" wind models, and how it
depends on basic stellar parameters. We find a relation of the kind of v_{\rm
exp} \propto (L/M)^{0.6}. By contrast to the vast changes of the mass-loss rate
in the final outflow phase, this relation suggest only very modest variations
in the wind velocity, even during a thermal pulse. Hence, we conclude that the
density profiles of cool envelopes around young PNe should indeed compare
relatively well with their recent mass-loss history, when diluted plainly by
the equation of continuity.

galaxies by measuring the average alignments between the major axes of the
pseudo inertia tensors from all satellites within cluster's virial radius and
from only those satellites within some smaller radius as a function of the
top-hat scale difference. The alignment profiles quantify how well the
satellite galaxies retain the memory of the external tidal fields after merging
into their host clusters and how fast they lose the initial alignment tendency
as the cluster's relaxation proceeds. It is found that the alignment profile
drops faster at higher redshifts and on smaller mass scales. This result is
consistent with the picture that the faster merging of the satellites and
earlier onset of the nonlinear effect inside clusters tend to break the
preferential alignments of the satellites with the external tidal fields.
Modeling the alignment profile of cluster galaxies as a power-law of the
density correlation coefficient that is independent of the power spectrum
normalization ($\sigma_{8}$) and demonstrating that the density correlation
coefficient varies sensitively with the density parameter ($\Omega_{m}$) and
neutrino mass fraction ($f_{\nu}$), we suggest that the alignment profile of
cluster galaxies might be useful for breaking the $\Omega_{m}$-$\sigma_{8}$ and
$f_{\nu}$-$\sigma_{8}$ degeneracies.

about the same luminosity M_R ~ -22 (and approximately the same mass). We
investigate the kinematics of these galaxies, and the radial and angular
distribution of their satellites. Using VIMOS at the VLT, we carried out a
spectroscopic survey in seven 14' x 14' fields each around a late-type isolated
spiral galaxy. We obtained radial velocities and spatial distributions for 77
candidate satellites. After removing the interlopers, we are left with 61 true
satellites. In combination with the rotation curves of the primary galaxies,
satellites are used to probe the gravitational potential of the primaries and
derive the dark matter halo properties by means of standard mass modeling
techniques. We find (a) that the dark matter haloes of luminous spirals (M_R ~
-22) have virial radii of ~400 kpc and virial masses of 3.5 x 10^12 Msun; (b)
that the radial velocity and angular distributions of the satellites around the
primaries are isotropic; and (c) that the resulting mass distribution is in
good agreement with that found in the optical regions of spirals and described
by the universal rotation curve of spirals once extrapolated to large radii.
The results obtained in this pilot phase of the project are already interesting
and limited only by small number statistics. The full project involving an
order of magnitude more targets, would very likely provide us with a definitive
picture of the dark matter distribution around spirals out to their virial
radii and beyond.

particular we take into account the constraints from EDM and from
$B$-observables. We analyse first the case where a Higgs boson mass is around
125 GeV and the other two Higgs masses are below 100 GeV and not observabed so
far. In the second case the lightest Higgs boson mass is around 125 GeV and the
other two are decoupled. We analyse the production of two Higgses and their
decay modes leading to various final states for these benchmark points. We
perform a collider simulation with PYTHIA and Fastjet where we consider all the
major backgrounds. Among the final states we have analysed, we find that
$2b+2\tau$ is promising and the signal significance is $5\sigma$ at an
integrated luminosity $\lesssim 10$ fb$^{-1}$. For some benchmark points it is
also possible to observe the light Higgs mass peak. We also explore the
leptonic final state which could be instrumental in the precision measurement
of a very light Higgs.

as the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array (TA), the search for the
sources of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) continues. Already we have
some hints about the sources or type of sources involved and more work is
required to confirm any of this. Aims: We intend to predict the UHECR fluxes
and the maximal energies of particles from two complete samples of nearby
active galaxies, selected at radio and far-infrared frequencies. Also, we
investigate the magnetic scattering of the UHECR path in the intervening cosmic
space. Methods: We propose here a new method of searching for the sources of
the UHECR in three steps, first we model the activity of the type of sources
and get the flux of UHECR and a maximal energy for particle acceleration, then
we model the interaction and angle deflection in the intergalactic space and
finally we simulate the distribution of the cosmic rays events that can be
statistically compared with future data of the cosmic rays observatories.
Results: We analyzed two classes of sources, gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and Radio
Galaxies (RGs). Ordering by the UHECR flux, few RGs are viable candidates, as
for GRB many sources are viable candidates, requiring less scattering of the
particles along their path to Earth to interpret the presently observed sky
distribution. Most of the flux from RGs comes from the Southern sky, and most
of the flux of particles from GRB comes from the North, although the
differences are so small as to require large statistics to confirm this. The
intergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields may help to distinguish the two
extreme cases, also pure protons from heavy nuclei at the same energy. As a
consequence flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C279 should confirm the
production of UHECR in this class of sources through energetic neutrinos.

$K$ deterministic sources impinging on an array of $M$ antennas, from $N$
observations of the source signal, corrupted by gaussian noise. The problem
reduces to estimate a quadratic form (called ""localization function"") of a
certain projection matrix related to the source signal empirical covariance
matrix. Recently, a new subspace estimation method (called ""G-MUSIC"") has been
proposed, in the context where the number of available samples $N$ is of the
same order of magnitude than the number of sensors $M$. In this context, the
traditional subspace methods tend to fail because the empirical covariance
matrix of the observations is a poor estimate of the source signal covariance
matrix. The G-MUSIC method is based on a new consistent estimator of the
localization function in the regime where $M$ and $N$ tend to $+\infty$ at the
same rate. However, the consistency of the angles estimator was not adressed.
The purpose of this paper is to prove the consistency of the angles of arrival
estimator in the previous asymptotic regime. To prove this result, we show the
property that the singular values of M x N Gaussian information plus noise
matrix escape from certain intervals is an event of probability decreasing at
rate O(1/N^p) for all p. A regularization trick is also introduced, which
allows to confine these singular values into certain intervals and to use
standard tools as Poincar\'e inequality to characterize any moments of the
estimator. These results are believed to be of independent interest.

  Let weak-BW be the statement the every bounded sequence in \ell_2 has a weak

thus that it is equivalent to (nested uses of) the usual Bolzano-Weierstra{\ss}
principle BW. We show that weak-BW is instance-wise equivalent to the
\Pi^0_2-CA. This means that for each \Pi^0_2 sentence A(n) there is a sequence
(x_i) in \ell_2, such that one can define the comprehension functions for A(n)
recursively in a cluster point of (x_i). As consequence we obtain that the
Turing degrees d > 0"" are exactly those degrees that contain a weak cluster
point of any computable, bounded sequence in \ell_2. Since a cluster point of
any sequence in the unit interval [0,1] can be computed in a degree low over
0', this show also that instances of weak-BW are strictly stronger than
instances of BW.

our analysis provide strong convincing evidence that the flare was produced by
the accretion of matter from a massive clump onto the compact object hosted in

velocity as the homogeneous stellar wind, we estimate a mass and radius of Mcl
\simeq1.4\times10^(22) g and Rcl \simeq8\times10^(11) cm. These are in

It is subdominant and mixed with the luminous matter inside the optical region
half-light radius wide, while it dominates the gravitational potential at outer
radii. On the whole, the dark halo structure is very similar to that found
around spirals of comparable luminosity and it is well reproduced by a Burkert

quantum information processing by investigating optimum unambiguous
discrimination problems for both the qubit and qutrit states. In general, a
priori knowledge in optimum unambiguous discrimination problems can be classed
into two types: a priori knowledge of discriminated states themselves and a
priori probabilities of preparing the states. It is clarified that whether a
priori probabilities of preparing discriminated states are available or not,
what type of discriminators one should design just depends on what kind of the
classical knowledge of discriminated states. This is in contrast to the
observation that choosing the parameters of discriminators not only relies on
the a priori knowledge of discriminated states, but also depends on a priori
probabilities of preparing the states. Two types of a priori knowledge can be
utilized to improve optimum performance but play the different roles in the
optimization from the view point of decision theory.
