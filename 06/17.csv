ice-mantle formation and (subsequent) grain coagulation. Following previous
work where the dust size distribution has been calculated from a state-of-the
art collision model for dust aggregates that involves both coagulation and
fragmentation (Paper I), the corresponding opacities are presented in this
study. The opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theory
assuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\mu}m silicate and graphite
grains and vacuum. In particular, we explore how the coagulation affects the
near-IR opacities and the opacity in the 9.7{\mu}m silicate feature. We find
that as dust aggregates grow to {\mu}m-sizes both the near-IR color excess and
the opacity in the 9.7 {\mu}m feature increases. Despite their coagulation,
porous aggregates help to prolong the presence of the 9.7{\mu}m feature. We
find that the ratio between the opacity in the silicate feature and the near-IR
color excess becomes lower with respect to the ISM, in accordance with many
observations of dark clouds. However, this trend is primarily a result of ice
mantle formation and the mixed material composition of the aggregates, rather
than being driven by coagulation. With stronger growth, when most of the dust
mass resides in particles of size 10{\mu}m or larger, both the near-IR color
excess and the 9.7{\mu}m silicate feature significantly diminish. Observations
at additional wavelengths, in particular in the sub-mm range, are essential to
provide quantitative constraints on the dust size distribution within dense
cores. Our results indicate that the sub-mm index {\beta} will increase
appreciably, if aggregates grow to ~100{\mu}m in size.

close to, but isolated from, rotating rings cooled to 5K. The observed ratio

is predicted using a new model that assumes that the inertial mass of the
gyroscope is caused by Unruh radiation that appears as the ring and the fixed
stars accelerate relative to it, and that this radiation is subject to a
Hubble-scale Casimir effect. The model predicts that the sudden acceleration of
the ring causes a slight increase in the inertial mass of the gyroscope, and,
to conserve momentum the gyroscope must move with the ring with an acceleration
ratio of 2.67+/-0.24*10^-8 for clockwise rotations and 1.34+/-0.12*10^-8 for
anticlockwise ones, in agreement with the observations. The model predicts that
in the southern hemisphere the anomaly should be larger for anticlockwise

topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) to their non-unitary counterparts.
Here we investigate Galois conjugates of quantum double models, such as the
Levin-Wen model. While these Galois conjugated Hamiltonians are typically
non-Hermitian, we find that their ground state wave functions still obey a
generalized version of the usual code property (local operators do not act on
the ground state manifold) and hence enjoy a generalized topological
protection. The key question addressed in this paper is whether such
non-unitary topological phases can also appear as the ground states of
Hermitian Hamiltonians. Specific attempts at constructing Hermitian
Hamiltonians with these ground states lead to a loss of the code property and
topological protection of the degenerate ground states. Beyond this we
rigorously prove that no local change of basis can transform the ground states
of the Galois conjugated doubled Fibonacci theory into the ground states of a
topological model whose Hermitian Hamiltonian satisfies Lieb-Robinson bounds.
These include all gapped local or quasi-local Hamiltonians. A similar statement
holds for many other non-unitary TQFTs. One consequence is that the ""Gaffnian""
wave function cannot be the ground state of a gapped fractional quantum Hall
state.

The superb angular resolution of the Chandra X-ray Observatory enables
distinguishing the pulsar from the surrounding nebulosity. Analysis of the
spectrum as a function of pulse phase allows the least-biased measure of
interstellar X-ray extinction due primarily to photoelectric absorption and
secondarily to scattering by dust grains in the direction of the Crab Nebula.
We modify previous findings that the line-of-sight to the Crab is
under-abundant in oxygen and provide measurements with improved accuracy and
less bias. Using the abundances and cross sections from Wilms, Allen & McCray
(2000) we find [O/H] = $(5.28 \pm 0.28)\times10^{-4}$ ($4.9 \times10^{-4}$ is
solar abundance). We also measure for the first time the impact of scattering
of flux out of the image by interstellar grains. We find $\tau_{\rm scat} =
0.147 \pm 0.043$. Analysis of the spectrum as a function of pulse phase also
measures the X-ray spectral index even at pulse minimum --- albeit with
increasing statistical uncertainty. The spectral variations are, by and large,
consistent with a sinusoidal variation. The only significant variation from the
sinusoid occurs over the same phase range as some rather abrupt behavior in the
optical polarization magnitude and position angle. We compare these spectral
variations to those observed in Gamma-rays and conclude that our measurements
are both a challenge and a guide to future modeling and will thus eventually
help us understand pair cascade processes in pulsar magnetospheres. The data
were also used to set new, and less biased, upper limits to the surface
temperature of the neutron star for different models of the neutron star
atmosphere.

on recent results in protoplanetary discs observations, to generate a variety
of planetary systems and analyze them statistically. We explore the relevance
of the mass and size of the disc, its metallicity, the mass of the central star
and the time-scale of gaseous disc dissipation, in defining the architecture of
the planetary system. We also test different values of some key parameters of
our model, to find out which factors best reproduce the diverse sample of
observed planetary systems. According to this, we predict which systems are the
most common in the solar neighbourhood. Our results show that planetary systems
with only terrestrial planets are the most common, being the only planetary
systems formed when considering low metallicity discs and which also represent
the best environment for the developing of rocky, potentially habitable
planets. We also found that planetary systems like our own are not rare in the
solar neighbourhood, being its formation favoured in massive discs where there
is not a large accumulation of solids in the inner region of the disc.
Regarding the planetary systems that harbor hot and warm Jupiter planets, we
found that this systems are born in very massive, metal-rich discs. Also a fast
migration rate is required in order to form these systems. According to our
results, most of the hot and warm Jupiter systems are composed by only one
giant planet, which is also a tendency of the current observational data.

star formation rate (Sigma_{SFR}) and the gas surface density (Sigma_{g}) in a
feedback regulated model of star formation in galactic disks. In this model,
star formation occurs in gravitationally bound protocluster clumps embedded in
larger giant molecular clouds with the protocluster clump mass function
following a power law function with a slope of -2. Metallicity dependent
feedback is generated by the winds of OB stars (M > 5 Msol) that form in the
clumps. The quenching of star formation in clumps of decreasing metallicity
occurs at later epochs due to weaker wind luminosities, thus resulting in
higher final star formation efficiencies (SFE_{exp}). By combining SFE_{exp}
with the timescales on which gas expulsion occurs, we derive the metallicity
dependent star formation rate per unit time in this model as a function of
Sigma_{g}. This is combined with the molecular gas fraction in order to derive
the global dependence of Sigma_{SFR} on Sigma_{g}. The model reproduces very
well the observed star formation laws extending from low gas surface densities
up to the starburst regime. Furthermore, our results show a dependence of
$\Sigma_{SFR}$ on metallicity over the entire range of gas surface densities in
contrast to other models, and can also explain part of the scatter in the
observations. We provide a tabulated form of the star formation laws that can
be easily incorporated into numerical simulations or semi-analytical models of
galaxy formation and evolution.

  Sparse Recovery in Large but Correlated Noise",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work studies the recursive robust principal components' analysis (PCA)
problem. Here, ""robust"" refers to robustness to both independent and correlated
sparse outliers, although we focus on the latter. A key application where this
problem occurs is in video surveillance where the goal is to separate a slowly
changing background from moving foreground objects on-the-fly. The background
sequence is well modeled as lying in a low dimensional subspace, that can
gradually change over time, while the moving foreground objects constitute the
correlated sparse outliers. In this and many other applications, the foreground
is an outlier for PCA but is actually the ""signal of interest"" for the
application; where as the background is the corruption or noise. Thus our
problem can also be interpreted as one of recursively recovering a time
sequence of sparse signals in the presence of large but spatially correlated
noise.
  This work has two key contributions. First, we provide a new way of looking
at this problem and show how a key part of our solution strategy involves
solving a noisy compressive sensing (CS) problem. Second, we show how we can
utilize the correlation of the outliers to our advantage in order to even deal
with very large support sized outliers. The main idea is as follows. The
correlation model applied to the previous support estimate helps predict the
current support. This prediction serves as ""partial support knowledge"" for
solving the modified-CS problem instead of CS. The support estimate of the
modified-CS reconstruction is, in turn, used to update the correlation model
parameters using a Kalman filter (or any adaptive filter). We call the
resulting approach ""support-predicted modified-CS"".

translational symmetry of the conventional BaFe$_2$Se$_2$-like crystal of
$I4/mmm$ space group. This pairing state becomes compatible when the Fe
vacancies form an ordered state and the crystal symmetry changes to a
low-temperature $I4/m$ one. For the specific case of an incommensurate vacancy
order at $Q_v=(1/5, 3/5)$ in K$_{0.82(2)}$Fe$_{1.626(3)}$Se$_2$, we find that
it induces a block checkerboard antiferromagnetic phase at wavevector ${\bf
Q}_m=4{\bf Q}_v$. The coexistence of vacancy order and magnetic order leads to
a reconstructed ground state which naturally couples to the $d-$wave
superconductivity in a uniform phase in what we propose will be a general
coupling for all iron-selenide superconductors. Our results agree with numerous
experimental data available to date. We thus suggest that the
incommensurability leads to uniform coexistence of multiple phases as a viable
alternative to a nanoscale phase separation in high-$T_c$ superconductors and

is concerned with the behaviour of the distributions of the overshoot and

asymptotics under minimal conditions in the Cram\'er case, and compare them

the striking and unexpected fact that they become identical when certain
parameters tend to equality.
  Thus, at least regarding these quantities, the ""medium-heavy"" tailed
convolution equivalent model segues into the ""light-tailed"" Cram\'er model in a
natural way. This suggests a usefully expanded flexibility for modelling the

asymptotic distributions obtained for the overshoot and undershoots, assuming
the L\'evy process belongs to the ""GTSC"" class.

Mortality rates (measured as the number of carcasses recorded per day) were

turtles and mammals, an exponential increase in mortality was observed after an

combined with a deviation from quasi-equilibrium conditions in the conduction
band. The latter is confirmed by a simple model suggesting that the deviation
from quasi-equilibrium is caused by the much shorter recombination lifetime in
the films relative to bulk Ge.

reflection groups---generated by complex reflections through a set of
hyperplanes, the author announced a general conjecture related to reflection
groups. The claim is that for each reflection group G, there is a G-equivariant
holomorphic map that is critical exactly on the set of reflecting hyperplanes.
One such group is the Valentiner action V---isomorphic to the alternating group
A_6---on the complex projective plane. A previous algorithm that solved
sixth-degree equations harnessed the dynamics of a V-equivariant. However,
important global dynamical properties of this map were unproven. Revisiting the
question in light of the reflection group conjecture led to the discovery of a
degree-31 map that is critical on the 45 lines of reflection for V. The map's
critical finiteness provides a means of proving its possession of the previous
elusive global properties. Finally, a sextic-solving procedure that employs
this map's reliable dynamics is developed.

large collection of interacting Markov chains is studied. The evolution of the
interacting particles is described through a time inhomogeneous transition
probability kernel that depends on the 'gradient' of the potential field. The
particles, in turn, dynamically modify the potential field through their
cumulative input. Interacting Markov processes of the above form have been
suggested as models for active biological transport in response to external
stimulus such as a chemical gradient. One of the basic mathematical challenges
is to develop a general theory of stability for such interacting Markovian
systems and for the corresponding nonlinear Markov processes that arise in the
large agent limit. Such a theory would be key to a mathematical understanding
of the interactive structure formation that results from the complex feedback
between the agents and the potential field. It will also be a crucial
ingredient in developing simulation schemes that are faithful to the underlying
model over long periods of time. The goal of this work is to study qualitative
properties of the above stochastic system as the number of particles (N) and
the time parameter (n) approach infinity. In this regard asymptotic properties
of a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system, that arises in the propagation
of chaos limit of the stochastic model, play a key role. We show that under
suitable conditions this dynamical system has a unique fixed point. This result
allows us to study stability properties of the underlying stochastic model. We
show that as N \rightarrow \infty, the stochastic system is well approximated
by the dynamical system, uniformly over time. As a consequence, for an
arbitrarily initialized system, as N\rightarrow \infty and n \rightarrow
\infty, the potential field and the empirical measure of the interacting
particles are shown to converge to the unique fixed point of the dynamical
system. In general, simulation of such interacting Markovian systems is a
computationally daunting task. We propose a particle based approximation for
the dynamic potential field which allows for a numerically tractable simulation
scheme. It is shown that this simulation scheme well approximates the true
physical system, uniformly over an infinite time horizon.

  The quote above illustrates a widely shared assumption about recursion
implementations: either they are done in purely structural terms or they cannot
be done at all.
  Multi-dimensional interpolation on a grid is one of hosts of semi-recursive
schemes that, while often referred to as recursive and routinely described in
vaguely recursive terms, cannot be implemented as a recursion in their
structural entirety.
  This article describes a computer-implemented scheme for isolating the
recursive core of interpolation on a multi-grid, an arrangement that both stems
from and provides a structural framework to a number of multi-dimensional
interpolation optimization techniques that, once implemented, provide gains in
multi-dimensional interpolation speed that, compared to some known benchmarks,
measure in multiple orders of magnitude.

down to kpc scales. We measure the IGrM entropy profile over 3 orders of
magnitude in radius, including 3 data bins beyond 0.5R200 with azimuthal

(>R500), and when corrected for the enclosed gas fraction, the entropy profile
is very close to the predictions from self-similar structure formation
simulations, as seen in massive clusters. Within Rvir, we measure a baryon
fraction of 0.17+/-0.02, consistent with the Cosmological value. These results
are in sharp contrast to the gas behaviour at large scales recently reported in

multi-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25
galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. The survey,
described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of
concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of CDM. The
CLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of
space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized
lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.
Specifically, twenty CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray
selected clusters are massive (kT > 5 keV; 5 - 30 x 10^14 M_solar) and, in most
cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their
lensing strength (Einstein radii > 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to further
quantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution dark
matter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified
high-redshift (z > 7) galaxies. The high magnification, in some cases, provides
angular resolutions unobtainable with any current UVOIR facility and can yield
z > 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. A total of 16
broadband filters, spanning the near-UV to near-IR, are employed for each
20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise
(sigma_phz < 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discovered
multiply-lensed images per cluster. Observations of each cluster are spread
over 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for Type Ia
supernovae at z > 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark

presence of an exterior massive planet, considering octupole-order secular
interactions. In the standard Kozai mechanism (SKM), the planet's orbit is
circular, and so the particle conserves vertical angular momentum. As a result,
the particle's orbit oscillates periodically, exchanging eccentricity for
inclination. However, when the planet's orbit is eccentric, the particle's
vertical angular momentum varies and its Kozai oscillations are modulated on
longer timescales---we call this the eccentric Kozai mechanism (EKM). The EKM
can lead to behavior that is dramatically different from the SKM. In
particular, the particle's orbit can flip from prograde to retrograde and back
again, and it can reach arbitrarily high eccentricities given enough time. We
map out the conditions under which this dramatic behavior (flipping and extreme
eccentricities) occurs, and show that when the planet's eccentricity is
sufficiently high, it occurs quite generically. For example, when the planet's
eccentricity exceeds a few percent of the ratio of semi-major axes (outer to
inner), around half of randomly oriented test particle orbits will flip and
reach extreme eccentricities. The SKM has often been invoked for bringing pairs
of astronomical bodies (star-star, planet-star, compact-object pairs) close
together. Including the effect of the EKM will enhance the rate at which such
matchmaking occurs.

role in shaping the properties of galaxies. For this reason, cosmological
studies focused on the evolution of halo/subhalo pairs are vital. In this paper
I describe a large catalogue of halo pairs extracted from the publicly
available Millennium Simulation (Springel et. al. 2005). (Throughout this work
I use the term `halo' to refer both to individual haloes in the field and
subhaloes embedded in larger structures.) Pairs are selected according to
whether or not they come within a given critical (comoving) distance dcrit,
without the prerequisite that they must merge. Also, a condition requiring
haloes to surpass a critical mass Mcrit during their history is imposed. The
primary catalogue, consisting of 502,705 pairs, is selected by setting dcrit=1
Mpc/h and Mcrit = 8.6 10^10 Msun/h (equivalent to 100 simulation particles).
One of the central goals of this paper is to evaluate the effects of modifying
these criteria. For this purpose, additional subcatalogues with more stringent
proximity and mass conditions are constructed (i.e., dcrit=200 kpc/h or/and
Mcrit=8.6 10^11 Msun/h =1,000 simulation particles). I use a simple five stage
picture to perform statistical analyses of their separations, redshifts,
masses, mass ratios, and relevant lifetimes. The fraction of pairs that never
merge (because one of the members is absorbed by an external halo or both
members survive until today) is accounted for. These results provide a broad
picture that captures the essential characteristics behind the evolution of
halo pairs. This is the first of a series of papers aimed to explore the huge
wealth of information encoded in this catalogue. Such investigations will play
a fundamental role in future cosmological studies of interacting galaxies and
binary (and multiple) quasars.

vector of the discrete graphical action. The difference matrix and source
vector of theory X are related via a graphical self-consistency criterion (SCC)
based on the boundary of a boundary principle on a graph. In this approach, the
SCC ensures the source vector is divergence-free and resides in the row space
of the difference matrix. Accordingly, the difference matrix will necessarily
have a nontrivial eigenvector with eigenvalue zero, so the graphical SCC is the
origin of gauge invariance. Factors of infinity associated with gauge groups of
infinite volume are excluded in our approach, since Z is restricted to the row

episodes of rapid disk accretion; yet until recently evolutionary tracks for
these protostars assumed only constant or slowly-varying accretion. Important
initial steps toward examining the potential effects of rapid accretion were
recently made by Baraffe, Chabrier, & Gallardo, who showed that in the limit of
low-temperature (""cold"") accretion, protostars may have much smaller radii than
found in previous treatments. Such small radii at the end of protostellar
accretion would have the effect of making some young stars appear much older -
perhaps as much as 10 Myr - than they really are. However, we argue that very
rapid disk accretion is unlikely to be cold, because observations of the
best-studied pre-main sequence disks with rapid disk accretion outbursts - the
FU Ori objects - have spectral energy distributions which imply large, not
small, protostellar radii. In addition, theory indicates models that at high
accretion rates, protostellar disks become internally hot and geometrically
thick, making it much more likely that hot material is added to the star. In
addition, the very large luminosity of the accretion disk is likely to
irradiate the central star strongly, heating up the outer layers and
potentially expanding them. Nevertheless, the Baraffe et al. calculations
emphasize the importance of initial protostellar radii for subsequent
evolution.

(6dFGS) and detect a Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal. The 6dFGS BAO
detection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at z_{\rm eff}
= 0.106. We achieve a distance measure of D_V(z_{\rm eff}) = 456\pm27 Mpc and a
measurement of the distance ratio, r_s(z_d)/D_V(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.336\pm0.015
(4.5% precision), where r_s(z_d) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch z_d.
The low effective redshift of 6dFGS makes it a competitive and independent
alternative to Cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the Hubble
constant. We find a Hubble constant of H_0 = 67\pm3.2 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1} (4.8%
precision) that depends only on the WMAP-7 calibration of the sound horizon and
on the galaxy clustering in 6dFGS. Compared to earlier BAO studies at higher
redshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. The
sensitivity to H_0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energy
equation of state parameter w and H_0 in the CMB data. We determine that w =
-0.97\pm0.13, using only WMAP-7 and BAO data from both 6dFGS and
\citet{Percival:2009xn}. We also discuss predictions for the large scale
correlation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the WALLABY blind H{\sc
I} survey (with the Australian SKA Pathfinder, ASKAP), and the proposed TAIPAN
all-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST). We
find that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the BAO peak,
making WALLABY the first radio galaxy survey to do so. We also predict that
TAIPAN has the potential to constrain the Hubble constant with 3% precision.

equidistribution of pullbacks of points for $C^1$-test functions in terms of
the proximity of wandering critical orbits to the initial points, and show that
the order is $O(\sqrt{kd^{-k}})$ upto a specific exceptional set of capacity 0

points and the omega-limit set of wandering critical points from the Julia set

Favre and Rivera-Letelier's quantitative equidistribution in a purely local

case n = 1, Schroeder's equation, f \circ \phi = \phi '(0) f has a solution f,
which is bijective near 0 precisely when \phi '(0) \neq 0. In 2003, Cowen and
MacCluer formulated the analogous problem in C^n (for a non-negative integer n)
by defining Schroeder's equation in several variables as F \circ \phi = \phi
'(0)F and giving appropriate assumptions on \phi . The 2003 Cowen and MacCluer
paper also provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an analytic
solution, F taking values in C^n and having full-rank near 0 under the
additional assumption that \phi '(0) is diagonalizable. The main result of this
paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a Schroeder solution F
which has full rank near 0 without the added assumption of diagonalizability.
More generally, it is proven in this paper that the functional equation F \circ
\phi = \phi '(0)^k F with k a positive integer, is always solvable with an F
whose component functions are linearly independent, but if k > 1 any such F
cannot be injective near 0. In 2007 Enoch provides many theorems giving formal

proved in this note that any formal power series solution indeed represents an
analytic function on the ball.

that the sufficient conditions can be relaxed, and the locations can even be

n-superalgebra is obtained from an (n+1)-cocycle on a nilpotent Lie
superalgebra, there is a geometric procedure to integrate the cocycle to one on
the corresponding nilpotent Lie supergroup.
  In general, a smooth (n+1)-cocycle on a supergroup yields a `Lie
n-supergroup': that is, a weak n-group internal to supermanifolds. Using our
geometric procedure to integrate the 3-cocycle in dimensions k+2, we obtain a
Lie 2-supergroup extending the Poincare supergroup in those dimensions, and
similarly integrating the 4-cocycle in dimensions k+3, we obtain a Lie
3-supergroup extending the Poincare supergroup in those dimensions.

creativity is unique in that it has transformed our planet. Given that the
anatomy of the human brain is not so different from that of the great apes,
what enables us to be so creative? Recent collaborations at the frontier of
anthropology, archaeology, psychology, and cognitive science are culminating in
speculative but increasingly sophisticated efforts to answer to this question.
Examining the skeletons of our ancestors gives cues as to anatomical
constraints that hindered or made possible various kinds of creative
expression. Relics of the past have much to tell us about the thoughts,
beliefs, and creative abilities of the people who invented and used them. How
the spectacular creativity of humans came about is the first topic addressed in
this chapter. Studies at the intersection of creativity and evolution are not
limited to investigations into the biological evolution of a highly creative
species. Creative ideas themselves might be said to evolve through culture.
Human creativity is distinctive because of the adaptive and open-ended manner
in which change accumulates. Inventions build on previous ones in ways that
enhance their utility or aesthetic appeal, or make them applicable in different
situations. There is no a priori limit to how a creative idea might unfold. It
is this proclivity to take an idea and make it our own, or 'put our own spin on
it', that makes creative ideas evolve. The next section of this chapter
investigates in what sense creative ideas evolve through culture. Finally, we
address what forces supported the evolution of creativity. Does being creative
help us live longer, or attract mates? Perhaps creative projects can sometimes
interfere with survival and reproductive fitness; are there non-biological
factors that compel us to create? This is a third topic addressed in this
chapter.

chiral fermions we find, in strong coupling regime, that the density inside the

Similar results hold also for non-chiral fermions. As one moves from weak to

attractive. Different power-laws of induced density are found for chiral and

$ab$-$initio$ type cluster model in order to clarify the role of the tensor
force and to investigate cluster distortions in low energy $d+d$ and $t+p$
scattering. In the present method, the description of the cluster wave function
is extended from a simple (0$s$) harmonic-oscillator shell model to a few-body
model with a realistic interaction, in which the wave function of the
subsystems are determined with the Stochastic Variational Method. In order to
calculate the matrix elements of the four-body system, we have developed a
Triple Global Vector Representation method for the correlated Gaussian basis
functions. To compare effects of the cluster distortion with realistic and
effective interactions, we employ the AV8$^{\prime}$ potential as a realistic
interaction and the Minnesota potential as an effective interaction. Especially
for $^1S_0$, the calculated phase shifts show that the $t+p$ and $h+n$ channels
are strongly coupled to the $d+d$ channel for the case of the realistic
interaction. On the contrary, the coupling of these channels plays a relatively
minor role for the case of the effective interaction. This difference between
both potentials originates from the tensor term in the realistic interaction.
Furthermore, the tensor interaction makes the energy splitting of the negative
parity states of $^4$He consistent with experiments. No such splitting is
however reproduced with the effective interaction.

This criterion turns out to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the
full correlation, where it includes information on both entanglement and
correlation other than entanglement. Moreover, we discuss to what extent this
criterion can give information on the entanglement of the system. The criterion
is generic in the sense that it can be applied to mixed and pure systems. Also,
it can be easily extended to treat the correlation of multipartite systems. We
compare the results obtained from this criterion to those from concurrence for
various examples and we gain agreement regarding entanglement. We believe that
this criterion may have a wide range of potential applications in quantum
information theory.

estimation bias for computational efficiency. The joint optimisation problem is
tackled via a Bayesian framework using the Iterated Conditioning on the Modes

efficient solutions to the identification problem, for comparison. We
illustrate the estimation performance of our methodology for a range of widely
used relay functionalities. The relative total error attained by our algorithm

The radio bursts correlate very well with the EUV jets coming from the western
side of a sunspot in AR11092. The EUV jet emission also correlates well with
brightening at what looks like their footpoint at the edge of the umbra. For
10-15 min after strong EUV jets are ejected, the footpoint brightens at roughly
3 min intervals. In both the EUV images and the extracted light curves, it
looks as though the brightening is related to the 3-min sunspot oscillations,
although the correlation coefficient is rather low. The only open field near
the jets is rooted in the sunspot. We conclude that active region EUV/X-ray

formation and evolution. Complementing our previous studies in innermost fields
(3<R<7 kpc), we obtained deep color magnitude diagrams in 6 fields with radius
from 5.2 to 9.2 kpc. The comparison with isochrones shows that while the oldest
population is approximately coeval in all fields, the age of the youngest
populations increases with increasing radius. Low-resolution spectroscopy in
the infrared CaII triplet region has been obtained for about 150 stars near the
tip red giant branch in the same fields. Radial velocities and stellar
metallicities have been obtained from these spectra. The metallicity
distribution of each field has been analyzed together with those previously
studied. The metal content of the most metal-poor objects, which are also the
oldest according to the derived age-metallicity relationships, is similar in
all fields independently of the radius. However, while the metallicity of the
most metal-rich objects measured, which are the youngest ones, remains constant
in the inner 6 kpc, it decreases with increasing radius from there off. The
same is true for the mean metallicity. According to the derived age-metallicity
relationships, which are consistent with being the same in all fields, this
result may be interpreted as an outside-in formation scheme in opposition with
the inside-out scenario predicted by LCDM cosmology for a galaxy like the LMC.
The analysis of the radial velocities of our sample of giants shows that they
follow a rotational cold disk kinematics. The velocity dispersion increases as
metallicity decreases indicating that the most metal-poor/oldest objects are
distributed in a thicker disk than the most metal-rich/youngest ones in
agreement with the findings in other disks such as that of the Milky Way. They
do not seem to be part of a hot halo, if one exists in the LMC.

estimates of Lyman alpha emission from a protogalactic halo illuminated by UV

performed cosmological hydrodynamics simulations with the adaptive mesh
refinement code FLASH, including a detailed network for primordial
chemistry,comprising the formation of primordial molecules, a multi-level model
for the hydrogen atom as well as the photo-ionization and photo-dissociation
processes in a UV background. We find that the presence of a background
radiation field J_21 excites the emission of Lyman alpha photons, increasing
the Lyman alpha luminosity up to two orders of magnitude. For a halo of \sim
10^10 M_sun, we find that a maximum flux of 5 \times 10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 is
obtained for J21 \times f_esc = 0.1, where f_esc is the escape fraction of the
ionizing radiation. Depending on the environmental conditions, the flux may
vary by three orders of magnitude. For J_21 \times f_esc > 0.1 the Lyman alpha
luminosity decreases as the atomic hydrogen abundance becomes rather small. The
fluxes derived here can be probed using Subaru and the upcoming James Webb
Space Telescope. The emission of Lyman alpha photons is extended and comes from
the envelope of the halo rather than its core. In the center of the halo, line
trapping becomes effective above columns of 10^22 cm^-2 and suppresses the
emission of Lyman alpha. In addition, cooling by primordial molecules may
decrease the gas temperature in the central region, which further reduces Lyman
alpha emission. In the central core, H_2 is photo-dissociated for a background
flux of J_21 \geq 1000. For weaker radiation fields, i.e. J_21 < 0.1, H_2 and
HD cooling are particularly strong in the center of the halo, leading to gas
temperatures as low as \sim 100 K.

cluster Abell 194, which hosts two luminous radio galaxies, NGC547 (3C 40B) and
NGC541 (3C 40A). We demonstrated the presence of a large X-ray cavity (r~34
kpc) formed by the giant southern radio lobe arising from 3C 40B in NGC547. The
estimated age of the cavity is t=7.9 x 10^7 years and the total work of the AGN
is 3.3 x 10^59 erg, hence the cavity power is P_cav=1.3 x 10^44 erg/s.
Furthermore, in the Chandra images of NGC545 and NGC541 we detected sharp
surface brightness edges, identified as merger cold fronts, and extended tails.
Using the pressure ratios between inside and outside the cold fronts we
estimated that the velocities of NGC545 and NGC541 correspond to Mach-numbers
of M=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.5} and M=0.9^{+0.2}_{-0.5}, respectively. The low radial
velocities of these galaxies relative to the mean radial velocity of Abell 194
imply that their motion is oriented approximately in the plane of the sky.
Based on these and earlier observations, we concluded that NGC545 and NGC541
are falling through the cluster, whose center is NGC547, suggesting that Abell
194 is undergoing a significant cluster merger event. Additionally, we detected
20 bright X-ray sources around NGC547 and NGC541, a surprisingly large number,
since the predicted number of resolved LMXBs and CXB sources is 2.2 and 4.1,
respectively. To explain the nature of additional sources, different
possibilities were considered, none of which are satisfactory. We also studied
the origin of X-ray emission in Minkowski's Object, and concluded that it is
most likely dominated by the population of HMXBs rather than by hot diffuse
ISM. Moreover, in view of the galaxy dynamics in Abell 194, we explored the
possibility that the starburst in Minkowski's Object was triggered by its past
interaction with NGC541, and concluded that it may be a viable path.

conclude that unresolved emission is determined by four main components, three
of which were known before: (i) The population of faint unresolved sources
associated with old stellar population. In early-type galaxies, their 2-10 keV
band luminosity scales with the stellar mass with L_X/L_K = (3.1\pm 0.9) x
10^27 erg/s/L_K,sun; (ii) The ISM with kT ~ 0.2-0.8 keV present in galaxies of
all types. Because of the large dispersion in the gas content of galaxies, the
size of our sample is insufficient to obtain reliable scaling law for this
component; (iii) The population of unresolved young stars and young stellar
objects in late-type galaxies. Their 2-10 keV band luminosity scales with the
star-formation rate with L_X/SFR = (1.7\pm0.9) x 10^38 (erg/s)/(M_sun/yr); (iv)
In four old and massive Virgo ellipticals (M49, M60, M84, NGC4636) we find
anomalously high X-ray emission in the 2-10 keV band. Its presence has not been
recognized before and its nature is unclear. Although it appears to be stronger
in galaxies having stronger ISM component, its existence cannot be explained in
terms of an extrapolation of the warm ISM spectrum. Association with Virgo
cluster of galaxies suggests that the excess emission may be due to
intracluster gas accreted in the gravitational well of a massive galaxy. We
investigate this and other possibilities.

sets of quasi-steady, high-emissivity, nearly-parallel X-ray stripes in some
localized regions of the SNR. These stripes are most likely the result of
cosmic-ray (CR) generated magnetic turbulence at the SNR blast wave. However,
for the amazingly regular pattern of these stripes to appear requires the
simultaneous action of a number of shock-plasma phenomena and is not predicted
by most models of magnetic field amplification. A consistent explanation of
these stripes yields information on the complex nonlinear plasma processes
connecting efficient CR acceleration and magnetic field fluctuations in strong
collisionless shocks. The nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NL-DSA) model
described here, which includes magnetic field amplification from a cosmic-ray
current driven instability, does predict stripes consistent with the
synchrotron emission observations of Tycho's SNR. We argue that the local
ambient mean magnetic field geometry determines the orientation of the stripes
and therefore it can be reconstructed with the high resolution X-ray imaging.
The estimated maximum energy of the CR protons responsible for the stripes is
$\sim 10^{15}$\,eV. Furthermore, the model predicts that a specific X-ray
polarization pattern, with a polarized fraction ~ 50%, accompanies the stripes,
which can be tested with future X-ray polarimeter missions.

2011] provided a fast implementation of the exact real numbers in the Coq proof
assistant. Our implementation improved on an earlier implementation by O'Connor
by using type classes to describe an abstract specification of the underlying
dense set from which the real numbers are built. In particular, we used dyadic
rationals built from Coq's machine integers to obtain a 100 times speed up of
the basic operations already. This article is a substantially expanded version
of [Krebbers/Spitters 2011] in which the implementation is extended in the
various ways. First, we implement and verify the sine and cosine function.
Secondly, we create an additional implementation of the dense set based on
Coq's fast rational numbers. Thirdly, we extend the hierarchy to capture order
on undecidable structures, while it was limited to decidable structures before.
This hierarchy, based on type classes, allows us to share theory on the
naturals, integers, rationals, dyadics, and reals in a convenient way. Finally,
we obtain another dramatic speed-up by avoiding evaluation of termination
proofs at runtime.

field properties have been studied rather intensively with coil designs, the
dynamics have been neglected almost completely for a long time. Instead, the
devices and their technology defined the waveform. Here, an analysis of the
waveform space is performed. Based on these data, an appropriate optimisation
approach is outlined which makes use of a modern nonlinear axon description of
a mammalian motor nerve. The approach is based on a hybrid global-local method;
different coordinate systems for describing the continuous waveforms in a
limited parameter space are defined for sufficient stability. The results of
the numeric setup suggest that there is plenty of room for waveforms with
higher efficiency than the traditional shapes. One class of such pulses is
analysed further. Although the voltage profile of these waveforms is almost
rectangular, the current shape presents distinct characteristics, such as a
first phase which precedes the main pulse and decreases the losses. The single
representatives, which differ in their maximum voltage shape, are linked by a
nonlinear transformation. The main phase, however, seems to scale in time only.

the nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of

natural human mobility, diffusion does not capture the high degree of
predictability in natural human mobility patters, e.g. the high percentage of
return movements to individuals' base location, the effective force of

the model exhibits significant dynamical differences in comparison to ordinary

human mobility model exhibits a saturation of wave front speeds and a novel

$I^\natural \subset I^{\rm cont}$ and $I^{\rm cont} \subset I^{\rm ax}$ can be

investigation is done to handle the challenges of face recognition, which
include pose variations, changes in facial expression, partial occlusions,
variations in illumination, rotation through different angles, change in scale
etc. To overcome these obstacles we have implemented and thoroughly examined
two different fusion techniques through rigorous experimentation. In the first
method log-polar transformation is applied to the fused images obtained after
fusion of visual and thermal images whereas in second method fusion is applied
on log-polar transformed individual visual and thermal images. After this step,
which is thus obtained in one form or another, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) is applied to reduce dimension of the fused images. Log-polar transformed
images are capable of handling complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation.
The main objective of employing fusion is to produce a fused image that
provides more detailed and reliable information, which is capable to overcome
the drawbacks present in the individual visual and thermal face images.
Finally, those reduced fused images are classified using a multilayer
perceptron neural network. The database used for the experiments conducted here
is Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database
benchmark thermal and visual face images. The second method has shown better
performance, which is 95.71% (maximum) and on an average 93.81% as correct
recognition rate.

corresponding thermal images to generate fused image. Data fusion is
implemented in the wavelet domain after decomposing the images through
Daubechies wavelet coefficients (db2). During the data fusion maximum of
approximate and other three details coefficients are merged together. After
that Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is applied over the fused coefficients
and finally two different artificial neural networks namely Multilayer
Perceptron(MLP) and Radial Basis Function(RBF) networks have been used
separately to classify the images. After that, for decision fusion based
decisions from both the classifiers are combined together using Bayesian
formulation. For experiments, IRIS thermal/visible Face Database has been used.
Experimental results show that the performance of multiple classifier system
along with decision fusion works well over the single classifier system.

extracted from the Gabor wavelet transformation of frontal face images, is
combined together with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for enhanced face
recognition. Firstly, the high-intensity feature vectors are automatically
extracted using the local characteristics of each individual face from the
Gabor transformed images. Then ICA is applied on these locally extracted
high-intensity feature vectors of the facial images to obtain the independent
high intensity feature (IHIF) vectors. These IHIF forms the basis of the work.
Finally, the image classification is done using these IHIF vectors, which are
considered as representatives of the images. The importance behind implementing
ICA along with the high-intensity features of Gabor wavelet transformation is
twofold. On the one hand, selecting peaks of the Gabor transformed face images
exhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation
selectivity. Thus these images produce salient local features that are most
suitable for face recognition. On the other hand, as the ICA employs locally
salient features from the high informative facial parts, it reduces redundancy
and represents independent features explicitly. These independent features are
most useful for subsequent facial discrimination and associative recall. The
efficiency of IHIF method is demonstrated by the experiment on frontal facial
images dataset, selected from the FERET, FRAV2D, and the ORL database.

Based on HARPS data, synthetic spectral modelling, and proper motions, we
derive the astrophysical parameters and kinematics of the star and discuss its
evolutionary status. This solar-mass red giant (Teff=3460+/-60K and
log(g)=0.6+/-0.2) is characterised by a relatively fast rotation (v
sin(i)~8km/s), slightly subsolar metallicity and a high-lithium abundance,
A(Li)=2.4+/-0.2dex. We discuss IRAS12556-7731 within the context of other known
lithium-rich K-type giants. Because it is close to the tip of the red giant
branch, IRAS12556-7731 is the coolest lithium-rich giant known so far, and it
is among the least massive and most luminous giants where enhancement of
lithium has been detected. Among several possible explanations, we cannot
preclude the possibility that the lithium enhancement and rapid rotation of the
star were triggered by the engulfment of a brown dwarf or a planet.

with a high p_T leading jet were found to have an increasing momentum imbalance
that was significantly larger than predicted by simulations. The angular
distribution of jet fragmentation products has been explored by associating
charged tracks with the jets measured in the calorimeters. By projecting the

IceCube detector in coincidence with the Crab nebula flare reported on
September 2010 by various experiments. Due to the unusual flaring state of the
otherwise steady source we performed a prompt analysis of the 79-string
configuration data to search for neutrinos that might be emitted along with the
observed gamma-rays. We performed two different and complementary data
selections of neutrino events in the time window of 10 days around the flare.
One event selection is optimized for discovery of E^-2 neutrino spectrum
typical of 1st order Fermi acceleration. A similar event selection has also
been applied to the 40-string data to derive the time-integrated limits to the
neutrino emission from the Crab. The other event selection was optimized for
discovery of neutrino spectra with softer spectral index and TeV energy
cut-offs as observed for various galactic sources in gamma-rays. The 90% CL
best upper limits on the Crab flux during the 10 day flare are 4.73 x 10^-11
cm-2 s-1 TeV-1 for an E^-2 neutrino spectrum and 2.50 x 10^-10 cm-2 s-1 TeV-1
for a softer neutrino spectra of E-2.7, as indicated by Fermi measurements
during the flare. IceCube has also set a time-integrated limit on the neutrino
emission of the Crab using 375.5 days of livetime of the 40-string
configuration data. This limit is compared to existing models of neutrino
production from the Crab and its impact on astrophysical parameters is
discussed. The most optimistic predictions of some models are already rejected
by the IceCube neutrino telescope with more than 90% CL.

perturbations in different cases. To this goal we use the squared sound speed
$v_s^2$ whose sign determines the stability of the model. When $v_s^2<0$ the
model is unstable against perturbation. At first we discuss the noninteracting
ghost dark energy model in a flat FRW universe and find out that such a model
is unstable due to the negativity of the $v_s^2$ in all epoches. The
interacting ghost dark energy model in both flat and non-flat universe are
studied in the next parts and in both cases we find that the squared sound
speed of ghost dark energy is always negative. This implies that the perfect
fluid for ghost dark energy is classically unstable against perturbations. In
both flat and non flat cases we find that the instability of the model
increases with increasing the value of the interacting coupling parameter.

binary evolution processes are incorporated; optically thick winds from
mass-accreting WDs, mass-stripping from the binary companion star by the WD
winds, and WDs being supported by differential rotation. The WD mass can
increase by accretion up to 2.3 (2.7) M_sun from the initial value of 1.1 (1.2)
M_sun, being consistent with high luminosity SNe Ia such as SN 2003fg, SN
2006gz, SN 2007if, and SN 2009dc. There are three characteristic mass ranges of
exploding WDs. In an extreme massive case, differentially rotating WDs explode
as an SN Ia soon after the WD mass exceeds 2.4 M_sun because of a secular
instability at T/|W|\sim 0.14. For a mid mass range of M_WD=1.5-2.4 M_sun, it
takes some time (spinning-down time) until carbon is ignited to induce an SN Ia
explosion after the WD mass has reached maximum, because it needs a loss or
redistribution of angular momentum. For a lower mass case of rigidly rotating
WDs, M_WD=1.38-1.5 M_sun, the spinning-down time depends on the timescale of
angular momentum loss from the WD. The difference in the spinning-down time may
produce the ""prompt"" and ""tardy"" components. We also suggest the very bright
super-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia are born in a low metallicity environment.

Van den Berg argued that this pattern grows out of the flux closure domains as
the external field is reduced. Based on experimental observations and theory,
we argue that in sufficiently elongated thin-film elements, the concertina
pattern rather bifurcates from an oscillatory buckling mode. Using a reduced
model derived by asymptotic analysis and investigated by numerical simulation,
we quantitatively predict the average period of the concertina pattern and
qualitatively predict its hysteresis. In particular, we argue that the
experimentally observed coarsening of the concertina pattern is due to
secondary bifurcations related to an Eckhaus instability. We also link the
