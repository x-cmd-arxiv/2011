huge discrepancy between the observed vacuum density and our expectations from
theories of high energy physics, which has been dubbed the Old Cosmological
Constant problem. One proposal to address this puzzle at the semi-classical
level is to decouple quantum vacuum from space-time geometry via a modification
of gravity that includes an incompressible fluid, known as Gravitational
Aether. In this paper, we discuss classical predictions of this theory along
with its compatibility with cosmological and experimental tests of gravity. We
argue that deviations from General Relativity (GR) in this theory are sourced
by pressure or vorticity. In particular, the theory predicts that the
gravitational constant for radiation is 33% larger than that of
non-relativistic matter, which is preferred by (most) cosmic microwave
background (CMB), Lyman-Alpha forest, and Lithium-7 primordial abundance
observations, while being consistent with other cosmological tests at ~2-sigma
level. It is further shown that all Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN)
parameters have the standard GR values aside from the anomalous coupling to
pressure, which has not been directly measured. A more subtle prediction of
this model (assuming irrotational aether) is that the (intrinsic)
gravitomagnetic effect is 33% larger than GR prediction. This is consistent
with current limits from LAGEOS and Gravity Probe B at ~2-sigma level.

intimately linked to complementarity, by which we mean that consistently
assigning values to different observables at the same time is not possible.
Nonlocality can only occur when some of the relevant observables do not
commute, and this noncommutativity makes the observables complementary. Beyond
quantum mechanics, the concept of complementarity can be formalized in several
distinct ways. Here we describe some of these possible formalizations and ask
how they relate to nonlocality. We partially answer this question by describing
two toy theories which display nonlocality and obey the no-signaling principle,
although each of them does not display a certain kind of complementarity. The
first toy theory has the property that it maximally violates the CHSH
inequality, although the corresponding local observables are pairwise jointly
measurable. The second toy theory also maximally violates the CHSH inequality,
although its state space is classical and all measurements are mutually
nondisturbing: if a measurement sequence contains some measurement twice with
any number of other measurements in between, then these two measurements give
the same outcome with certainty.

r$ vanishes within a range where the Hall resistivity forms a plateau. A
microscopic theory is developed, starting with a crystal lattice, setting up a
BCS-like Hamiltonian in terms of composite bosons, and using statistical
mechanical method. The main advantage of our bosonic theory is its capability
of explaning the plateau formation in the Hall resistivity, which is assumed in
the composite fermion theories. In the QHE under radiation, the resistivity
vanishes within a range with no plateau formation. This is shown in terms of
two-channels model, one channel excited by radiation where the supercurrents
run and the other (base) channel in which the normal currents run. The
transport diamonds (TD) and the zero direct current anomaly (ZCA) occur when
the resistivity $r$ is measured as a function of magnetic field and direct
current (DC). The spiral motion of an electron under a magnetic field can be
decomposed into two, the cyclotron motion with the cyclotron mass $m^*$ and the
guiding center motion with the magnetotransport $M^*$. The quantization of the
motion generates magnetic oscillations in the density of states. The
magnetoconductivity is calculated, using kinetic theory and quantum statistical
mechanics. The TR and ZCA are shown to be a breakdown of QHE. The integer QHE
minima are shown to become the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) maxima progressively as
the DC increases. The ZCA at low temperatures ($T=0.253$--1.2\,K) is
temperature-dependent, which is caused by the electron-optical-phonon
scattering.

negative eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This choice
implies that the energy density of the perfect fluid is negative. A stiff
matter perfect fluid with this property produces a model with a bouncing
solution, at the classical level, free from an initial singularity. After that,
we use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets and evaluate the
time-dependent expectation value of the scale factor. We find that it
oscillates between maximum and minimum values. Since the expectation value of
the scale factor never vanishes, we confirm that this model is free from an

photon to have 10 GeV or more of transverse energy, and to be in the central
region. Using an event selection optimized for the ttbar+photon candidate
sample we measure the production cross section of, and the ratio of cross
sections of the two samples. Control samples in the dilepton+photon and
lepton+photon+$\met$, channels are constructed to aid in decay product
identification and background measurements. We observe 30 ttbar+photon
candidate events compared to the standard model expectation of 26.9 +/- 3.4
events. We measure the ttbar+photon cross section to be 0.18+0.08 pb, and the
ratio of the cross section of ttbar+photon to ttbar to be 0.024 +/- 0.009.
Assuming no ttbar+photon production, we observe a probability of 0.0015 of the
background events alone producing 30 events or more, corresponding to 3.0
standard deviations.

path and merge to the identity path form two normal chains. The Schreier
refinement theorem can be applied to these two normal chains. The refinement of

Schreier matrix form, with rows and columns determined by the two normal
chains.
  Based on the Schreier matrix form, we give an encoder structure for a group
code which is an estimator. The encoder uses the important idea of shortest
length generator sequences previously explained by Forney and Trott. In this
encoder the generator sequences are shown to have an additional property: the
components of the generators are coset representatives in a chain coset
decomposition of the branch group B of the code. Therefore this encoder appears
to be a natural form for a group code encoder. The encoder has a register
implementation which is somewhat different from the classical shift register
structure.
  This form of the encoder can be extended. We find a composition chain of the
branch group B and give an encoder which uses coset representatives in the
composition chain of B. When B is solvable, the generators are constructed
using coset representatives taken from prime cyclic groups.

in five different Dark Energy models: the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and
four models where the Dark Energy density is allowed to have a non-trivial
redshift evolution. For each cosmology we have a control run with dark matter
only, in order to allow a direct assessment of the impact of baryonic
processes. We found that the power spectra of gas and stars, as well as the
total matter power spectrum, are in qualitative agreement with the results of
previous works in the framework of the fiducial model, although several
quantitative differences exist. We used the halo model in order to investigate
the backreaction of gas and stars on the dark matter distribution, finding that
it is very well reproduced by increasing the average dark matter halo
concentration by 17%, irrespective of the mass. Moving to model universes
dominated by dynamical Dark Energy, it turns out that they introduce a specific
signature on the power spectra of the various matter components, that is
qualitatively independent of the exact cosmology considered. This generic shape
is well captured by the halo model, however the finer details of the dark
matter power spectrum can be precisely captured only at the cost of a few
slight modifications to the ingredients entering the model. The backreaction of
baryons onto the dark matter distribution works pretty much in the same way as
in the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. Nonetheless, the increment in average
concentration is less pronounced than in the fiducial model (only $\sim 10%$),
in agreement with a series of other clues pointing toward the fact that star
formation is less efficient when Dark Energy displays a dynamical evolution.

metallic film, the previous analytical calculation for a single slot [Technical
Phys. 50, 1076 (2005)] is generalized into a model for an arbitrary linear
array of slots with variable slot width, slot separation and slot dielectric
material. The advantage as well as the effectiveness of the generalized model
presented in this paper are best described by enabling calculation of a
continuous spatial distribution of an electromagnetic field by inverting a
small discrete coefficient matrix spanned by both the slot index and the
slot-eigenmode index for a set of linear equations. In comparisons with
well-known plane-wave and finite-difference time-domain methods, inverting a
large matrix, in wave number space for the former case and in real space at
each time step for the latter case, can be avoided to greatly speed up
numerical calculations. In addition, based on a partial-domain method, the
formalism presented here can be employed to treat a composite surface (e.g., a
slotted metal film with different dielectric materials in the slots), while the
analytical Green's function approach [J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt. 8, S191

spin-orbit coupling forms local quintuplets with an effective spin moment
$j=2$. Moreover, due to strongly orbital-dependent exchange, the effective
spins have substantial biquadratic and bicubic interactions (fourth and sixth
order in the spins, respectively). This leads, at the mean field level, to a
rich ground state phase diagram which includes seven different phases: a
uniform ferromagnetic phase with an ordering wavevector ${\bf p} = {\bf 0}$ and
uniform magnetization along $[111]$ direction, four two-sublattice phases with
an ordering wavevector ${\bf p} = 2\pi(001)$ and two four-sublattice
antiferromagnetic phases. Amongst the two-sublattice phases there is a
quadrupolar ordered phase which preserves time reversal symmetry. Extending the
mean field theory to finite temperatures, we find ten different magnetization
processes with different magnetic thermal transitions. In particular, we find
that thermal fluctuations stabilize the two-sublattice quadrupolar ordered

The main originality of this model is to define a density and a life-time of
the virtual particles. Compared to the usual QED $(p,E)$ framework, we add here
the $(x,t)$ space time parameters. We show how $\epsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$
originate from the polarization and the magnetization of these virtual pairs
when the vacuum is stressed by an electrostatic or magnetostatic field
respectively. We obtain numerical values very close to the measured values. The
exact equalities constraint the free parameters of our vacuum model. Then we
show that if we simply model the propagation of a photon in vacuum as a
succession of transient captures with virtual pairs, we can derive a finite
velocity of the photon with a magnitude close to the measured speed of light
$c$. Again this is the occasion to adjust better our vacuum model. Since the
transit time of a photon is a statistical process we expect it to be
fluctuating and this translates into a fluctuation of $c$ which, if measured,
would bring another piece of information on the vacuum.
  When submitted to a stress the vacuum may change and this will induce a
variation in the electromagnetic constants. We show this to be the case around
a gravitational mass. It gives a physical interpretation of a varying vacuum
refractive index equivalent to the curved space-time in General Relativity. The
known measurements of the deflection of light by a mass, the Shapiro delay and
the gravitational redshift do bring constraints on the way inertial masses
should depend upon the vacuum.
  At last some experimental predictions are proposed.

transition and pattern formation for systems with long-range repulsive
interactions. The main focus is on the Cahn-Hilliard model with a nonlocal term
in the corresponding energy functional, representing the long-range repulsive
interaction. First, we show that as soon as the linear problem loses stability,
the system always undergoes a dynamic transition to one of the three types,
forming different patterns/structures. The types of transition are then
dictated by a nondimensional parameter, measuring the interactions between the
long-range repulsive term and the quadratic and cubic nonlinearities in the
model. The derived explicit form of this parameter offers precise information
for the phase diagrams. Second, we obtain a novel and explicit pattern
selection mechanism associated with the competition between the long-range
repulsive interaction and the short-range attractive interactions. In
particular, the hexagonal pattern is unique to the long-range interaction, and
is associated with a novel two-dimensional reduced transition equations on the
center manifold generated by the unstable modes, consisting of (degenerate)
quadratic terms and non-degenerate cubic terms. Finally, explicit information
on the metastability and basin of attraction of different disordered/ordered
states and patterns are derived as well.

proximity-induced superconducting systems ignores number-conservation and thus
leaves open the conceptual question of how a topological degeneracy that is
robust to all local perturbations arises in a number-conserving system. In this
work, we study how local attractive interactions generate a topological
ground-state near-degeneracy in a quasi one-dimensional superfluid using
bosonization of the fermions. The local attractive interactions opens a
topological quasiparticle gap in the odd channel wires (with more than one

We explicitly study the robustness of the topological degeneracy to local
perturbations and find that such local perturbations result in quantum phase
slips which split of the topological degeneracy by an amount that does not
decrease exponentially with the length of the wire, but still decreases rapidly
if the number of channels is large. Therefore a bulk superconductor with a
large number of channels is crucial for true topological degeneracy.

the study of astrophysical accretion disks. However, the fact that angular
momentum transport in disks is mediated by MHD turbulence (with structure down
to very small scales) raises the concern that the properties of the modeled
accretion disks are affected by the finite numerical resolution of the
simulation. By implementing an orbital advection algorithm into the Athena code
in cylindrical geometry, we have performed a set of global (but unstratified)
Newtonian disk simulations extending up to resolutions previously unattained.
We study the convergence of these models as a function of spatial resolution
and initial magnetic field geometry. The usual viscosity parameter ($\alpha$)
or the ratio of thermal-to-magnetic pressure ($\beta$) are found to be poor
diagnostics of convergence, whereas the average tilt angle of the magnetic
field in the $(r,\phi)$-plane is a very good diagnostic of convergence. We
suggest that this is related to the saturation of the MHD turbulence via
parasitic modes of the magnetorotational instability. Even in the case of
zero-net magnetic flux, we conclude that our highest resolution simulations
(with 32-zones and 64-zones per vertical scale height) have achieved
convergence.
  Our global simulations reach resolutions comparable to those used in local,
shearing box models of MHD disk turbulence. We find that the saturation
predictors derived from local simulations correspond well to the instantaneous
correlations between local flux and stress found in our global simulations.
However, the conservation of magnetic flux implicit in local models is not
realized in our global disks. Thus, the magnetic connectivity of an accretion
disk represents physics that is truly global and cannot be captured in any
ab-initio local model.

Kaluza-Klein vector mass scale $m_{KK}\gtrsim 3.5$ TeV, which is roughly the
lowest scale allowed by electroweak considerations. The model with Dirac

ancillary data from ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths, we estimate the
total emission from dust and stars of 62 nearby galaxies in the KINGFISH survey
in a way that is as empirical and model-independent as possible. We collect and
exploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated by
dust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. By including SPIRE
data, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previous
analyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dust
temperatures and masses.
  The dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the SEDs, has a
range of nearly three decades. The inclusion of SPIRE data shows that estimates
based on data not reaching these far-IR wavelengths are biased low. We find
that the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total IR
luminosity. We also find that dust/stellar flux ratios are related to gas-phase
metallicity, while the dust/stellar mass ratios are less so. The substantial
scatter between dust/stellar flux and dust/stellar mass indicates that the
former is a poor proxy of the latter. Comparing the dust/stellar flux ratios
and dust temperatures, we show that early-types tend to have slightly warmer
temperatures than spiral galaxies, which may be due to more intense
interstellar radiation fields, or to different dust grain compositions.
Finally, we show that early-types and early-type spirals have a strong
correlation between the dust/stellar flux ratio and specific star formation
rate, which suggests that the relatively bright far-IR emission of some of
these galaxies is due to ongoing star formation and the radiation field from
older stars.

signal-to-noise regimes, the background noise chosen to mimic that found in
interferometric radio maps. We show that our technique is capable of recovering
the parameters of the sources with a similar accuracy to that obtained from the
traditional AIPS task IMFIT when the image is relatively simple (e.g., few

recovering the parameters of the jet components. Our methodology is also able

slower for a single processor, depending on the number of sources to be
optimized). As in the case of any model fitting performed in the image plane,
caution is required in analyzing images constructed from a poorly sampled (u,v)

field can lead to a current parallel to the magnetic field. This is the chiral
magnetic effect. We use gauge-gravity duality to study the chiral magnetic
effect in large-Nc, strongly-coupled N=4 supersymmetric SU(Nc) Yang-Mills
theory coupled to a number Nf << Nc of N=2 hypermultiplets in the Nc
representation of SU(Nc), i.e. flavor fields. Specifically, we introduce an
external magnetic field and a time-dependent phase for the mass of the flavor
fields, which is equivalent to an axial chemical potential for the flavor
fermions, and we compute holographically the resulting chiral magnetic current.
For massless flavors we find that the current takes the value determined by the
axial anomaly. For massive flavors the current appears only in the presence of
a condensate of pseudo-scalar mesons, and has a smaller value than for massless
flavors, dropping to zero for sufficiently large mass or magnetic field. The
axial symmetry in our system is part of the R-symmetry, and the states we study
involve a net flow of axial charge to the adjoint sector from an external
source coupled to the flavors. We compute the time rate of change of axial
charge and of energy both in field theory and from holography, with perfect
agreement. In contrast to previous holographic models of the chiral magnetic
effect, in our system the vector current is conserved and gauge-invariant
without any special counterterms.

gravitationally lensed broad absorption line (BAL) quasar APM 08279+5255. These
results are based on spectral fits to all the long exposure observations of APM
08279+5255 using a new quasar-outflow model. This model is based on cloudy
simulations of a near-relativistic quasar outflow. The main conclusions from
our multi-epoch spectral re-analysis of Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku
observations of APM 08279+5255 are: 1) In every observation we confirm the
presence of two strong features, one at rest-frame energies between 1-4 keV,
and the other between 7-18 keV. 2) We confirm that the low-energy absorption
(1-4 keV rest-frame) arises from a low-ionization absorber with logNH~23 and
the high-energy absorption (7-18 keV rest-frame) arises from highly ionized
(3>log xi>4; where xi is the ionization parameter) iron in a near-relativistic
outflowing wind. Assuming this interpretation, we find that the velocities on
the outflow could get up to ~0.7c. 3) We confirm a correlation between the
maximum outflow velocity and the photon index and find possible trends between
the maximum outflow velocity and the X-ray luminosity, and between the total
column density and the photon index. We performed calculations of the force
multipliers of material illuminated by absorbed power laws and a
Mathews-Ferland SED. We found that variations of the X-ray and UV parts of the
SEDs and the presence of a moderate absorbing shield will produce important
changes in the strength of the radiative driving force. These results support
the observed trend found between the outflow velocity and X-ray photon index in
APM 08279+5255. If this result is confirmed it will imply that radiation
pressure is an important mechanism in producing quasar outflows.

model-independent constraints on reionization from cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and QSO absorption line data by decomposing the function N_{ion}(z) (the
number of photons entering the IGM per baryon in collapsed objects) into its
principal components. The main addition in this work is that for the CMB data
set, we explicitly include the angular power spectra C_l for TT, TE and EE
modes in our analysis which seem to contain somewhat more information than
taking the electron scattering optical depth tau_{el} as a single data point.
Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we find that all the quantities related
to reionization can be severely constrained at z < 6 whereas a broad range of
reionization histories at z > 6 are still permitted by the current data sets.
With currently available data from WMAP7, we constrain 0.080 < tau_{el} < 0.112
(95% CL) and also conclude that reionization is 50% complete between 9.0 <
z(Q_{HII} = 0.5) < 11.8 (95% CL) and is 99% complete between 5.8 < z(Q_{HII} =
0.99) < 10.4 (95% CL). With the forthcoming PLANCK data on large-scale
polarization (ignoring effect of foregrounds), the z > 6 constraints will be
improved considerably, e.g., the 2-sigma error on tau_{el} will be reduced to
0.009 and the uncertainties on z(Q_{HII} = 0.5) and z(Q_{HII} = 0.99) would be
\sim 1 and 3 (95% CL), respectively. For more stringent constraints on
reionization at z > 6, one has to rely on data sets other than CMB. Our method
will be useful in such case since it can be used for non-parametric
reconstruction of reionization history with arbitrary data sets.

different value of N. Bounds for the first scalar traceless-symmetric

the full set of constraints. Our analysis only assumes unitarity of the CFT,

--- a much larger timing program on $\gtrsim 50 - 100$ MSPs will be needed. For
other values of $A$, the constraint is $\sigma_r \lesssim 20 {\rm ns}
(A/10^{-15} {\rm yr}^{-2/3})$. Identification of suitable MSPs itself requires
an aggressive survey campaign followed by characterization of the level of spin
noise in the timing residuals of each object. The search and timing programs

suggests that the Kozai effect has played an important role in shaping their
dynamical architectures. However, the formation of planets in inclined binary
systems poses a considerable theoretical challenge, as orbital excitation due
to the Kozai resonance implies destructive, high-velocity collisions among
planetesimals. To resolve the apparent difficulties posed by Kozai resonance,
we seek to identify the primary physical processes responsible for inhibiting
the action of Kozai cycles in protoplanetary disks. Subsequently, we seek to
understand how newly-formed planetary systems transition to their observed,
Kozai-dominated dynamical states. We find that theoretical difficulties in
planet formation arising from the presence of a distant companion star, posed
by the Kozai effect and other secular perturbations, can be overcome by a
proper account of gravitational interactions within the protoplanetary disk. In
particular, fast apsidal recession induced by disk self-gravity tends to erase
the Kozai effect, and ensure that the disk's unwarped, rigid structure is
maintained. Subsequently, once a planetary system has formed, the Kozai effect
can continue to be wiped out as a result of apsidal precession, arising from
planet-planet interactions. However, if such a system undergoes a dynamical
instability, its architecture may change in such a way that the Kozai effect
becomes operative. The results presented here suggest that planetary formation
in highly inclined binary systems is not stalled by perturbations, arising from
the stellar companion. Consequently, planet formation in binary stars is
probably no different from that around single stars on a qualitative level.
Furthermore, it is likely that systems where the Kozai effect operates,
underwent a transient phase of dynamical instability in the past.

intracluster medium (ICM) generally requires some prior information, in
addition to the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry.
Often, this information takes the form of particular parametrized functions
used to describe the cluster gas density and temperature profiles. In this
paper, we investigate the implicit priors on hydrostatic masses that result
from this fully parametric approach, and the implications of such priors for
scaling relations formed from those masses. We show that the application of
such fully parametric models of the ICM naturally imposes a prior on the slopes
of the derived scaling relations, favoring the self-similar model, and argue
that this prior may be influential in practice. In contrast, this bias does not
exist for techniques which adopt an explicit prior on the form of the mass
profile but describe the ICM non-parametrically. Constraints on the slope of
the cluster mass--temperature relation in the literature show a separation
based the approach employed, with the results from fully parametric ICM
modeling clustering nearer the self-similar value. Given that a primary goal of
scaling relation analyses is to test the self-similar model, the application of
methods subject to strong, implicit priors should be avoided. Alternative
methods and best practices are discussed.

embedded in solvents including water and aqueous mixtures have emphasized the
observation of the distinctive temperature dependence of the atomic mean square
displacements, <u2>, commonly referred to as the dynamic transition at some
temperature Td. At low temperatures, <u2> increases slowly, but it assume
stronger temperature dependence after crossing Td, which depends on the
time/frequency resolution of the spectrometer. Various authors have made
connection of the dynamics of solvated proteins including the dynamic
transition to that of glass-forming substances. Notwithstanding, no connection
is made to the similar change of temperature dependence of <u2> obtained by
quasielastic neutron scattering when crossing the glass transition temperature
Tg, generally observed in inorganic, organic and polymeric glass-formers.
Evidences are presented to show that such change of the temperature dependence
of <u2> from neutron scattering at Tg is present in hydrated or solvated
proteins, as well as in the solvents used unsurprisingly since the latter is
just another organic glass-formers. The <u2> obtained by neutron scattering at
not so low temperatures has contributions from the dissipation of molecules
while caged by the anharmonic intermolecular potential at times before
dissolution of cages by the onset of the Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxation. The
universal change of <u2> at Tg of glass-formers had been rationalized by
sensitivity to change in volume and entropy of the beta-relaxation, which is
passed onto the dissipation of the caged molecules and its contribution to
<u2>. The same rationalization applies to hydrated and solvated proteins for
the observed change of <u2> at Tg.

contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. Sharir, Pnueli and Hart [SIAM J.
Comput. 13(1984)292-314] presented a general method for proving properties of
probabilistic programs, in which a probabilistic program is modeled by a Markov
chain and an assertion on the output distribution is extended into an invariant
assertion on all intermediate distributions. Their method is essentially a
probabilistic generalization of the classical Floyd inductive assertion method.
In this paper, we consider quantum programs modeled by quantum Markov chains
which are defined by super-operators. It is shown that the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart
method can be elegantly generalized to quantum programs by exploiting the
Schr\""odinger-Heisenberg duality between quantum states and observables. In
particular, a completeness theorem for the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart verification
method of quantum programs is established. 2. As indicated by the completeness
theorem, the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method is in principle effective for verifying
all properties of quantum programs that can be expressed in terms of Hermitian
operators (observables). But it is not feasible for many practical applications
because of the complicated calculation involved in the verification. For the
case of finite-dimensional state spaces, we find a method for verification of
quantum programs much simpler than the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method by employing
the matrix representation of super-operators and Jordan decomposition of
matrices. In particular, this method enables us to compute easily the average
running time and even to analyze some interesting long-run behaviors of quantum
programs in a finite-dimensional state space.

are not excluded. These universal theorems are the dynamic equivalent of the
universal theorems already known for the static case (Nemat-Nasser and Hori
1995). It is envisaged that the bounds on the total energy presented in this
paper will be used to formulate computable bounds on the overall dynamic
properties of linearly elastic heterogeneous composites with arbitrary

  California, Riverside, 2011",,,,"math-ph math.DG math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider generalizations of symplectic manifolds called n-plectic
manifolds. A manifold is n-plectic if it is equipped with a closed,
nondegenerate form of degree n+1. We show that higher structures arise on these
manifolds which can be understood as the categorified or homotopy analogues of
important structures studied in symplectic geometry and geometric quantization.
Just as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, we show
that any n-plectic manifold gives a Lie n-algebra containing certain
differential forms which we call Hamiltonian. Lie n-algebras are examples of
strongly homotopy Lie algebras. They consist of an n-term chain complex
equipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a
generalized Jacobi identity. We then develop the machinery necessary to
geometrically quantize n-plectic manifolds. In particular, just as a
prequantized symplectic manifold is equipped with a principal U(1)-bundle with
connection, a prequantized 2-plectic manifold is equipped with a U(1)-gerbe
with 2-connection. A gerbe is a categorified sheaf, or stack, which generalizes
the notion of a principal bundle. Furthermore, over any 2-plectic manifold
there is a vector bundle equipped with extra structure called a Courant
algebroid. This bundle is the 2-plectic analogue of the Atiyah algebroid over a
prequantized symplectic manifold. Its space of global sections also forms a Lie
2-algebra, which we use to prequantize the Lie 2-algebra of Hamiltonian forms.
Finally, we introduce the 2-plectic analogue of the Bohr-Sommerfeld variety
associated to a real polarization, and use this to geometrically quantize
2-plectic manifolds. The output of this procedure is a category of quantum
states. We consider a particular example in which the objects of this category
can be identified with representations of the Lie group SU(2).

measurement in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer. Non-magnetic anvils made of composite ceramic material were used
to generate high-pressure with a Cu-Be gasket. We have examined anvils with
different culet sizes (1.8, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 mm). The pressure
generated at low temperature was determined by the pressure dependence of the
superconducting transition of lead (Pb). The maximum pressure $P_{max}$ depends
on the culet size of the anvil: the values of $P_{max}$ are 2.4 and 7.6 GPa for
1.8 and 0.6 mm culet anvils, respectively. We revealed that the composite
ceramic anvil has potential to generate high pressure above 5 GPa. The
background magnetization of the Cu-Be gasket is generally two orders of
magnitude smaller than the Ni-Cr-Al gasket for the indenter cell. The present
cell can be used not only with ferromagnetic and superconducting materials with
large magnetization but also with antiferromagnetic compounds with smaller
magnetization. The production cost of the present pressure cell is about one
tenth of that of a diamond anvil cell. The anvil alignment mechanism is not
necessary in the present pressure cell because of the strong fracture toughness
(6.5 MPa${\cdot}$m$^{1/2}$) of the composite ceramic anvil. The simplified
pressure cell is easy-to-use for researchers who are not familiar with high
pressure technology. Representative results on the magnetization of
superconducting MgB$_2$ and antiferromagnet CePd$_5$Al$_2$ are reported.

potentially large amplitude of electric fields within these structures, their
effects on particle heating, scattering, or acceleration can be important. One

Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes, which are exact nonlinear solutions of
the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations in collisionless kinetic theory. BGK
modes have been studied extensively for many decades, predominately in one
dimension (1D), although there have been observations showing that some of
these structures have clear 3D features. While there have been approximate

extend the finite-size scaling theory of quantum phase transitions to
non-equilibrium setups. This allows, e.g., for studies of quantum phase
transitions in systems of fixed finite size by monitoring expectation values as
a function of the quench velocity. Non-equilibrium imaginary-time dynamics is
also amenable to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, with a scheme that we

element methods (CIP-FEMs) using piecewise linear polynomials for the Helmholtz
equation with the first order absorbing boundary condition in two and three
dimensions. The novelty of the proposed methods is to use complex penalty
parameters with positive imaginary parts. It is proved that, if the penalty
parameter is a pure imaginary number $\i\ga$ with $0<\ga\le C$, then the
proposed CIP-FEM is stable (hence well-posed) without any mesh constraint.
Moreover the method satisfies the error estimates $C_1kh+C_2k^3h^2$ in the
$H^1$-norm when $k^3h^2\le C_0$ and $C_1kh+\frac{C_2}{\ga}$ when $k^3h^2> C_0$
and $kh$ is bounded, where $k$ is the wave number, $h$ is the mesh size, and
the $C$'s are positive constants independent of $k$, $h$, and $\ga$. Optimal
order $L^2$ error estimates are also derived. The analysis is also applied if
the penalty parameter is a complex number with positive imaginary part. By
taking $\ga\to 0+$, the above estimates are extended to the linear finite
element method under the condition $k^3h^2\le C_0$. Numerical results are
provided to verify the theoretical findings. It is shown that the penalty
parameters may be tuned to greatly reduce the pollution errors.

observed without an automatic pointing system. It was the case of 474 Prudentia
occulting HIP 1927 on 5 September 2010, observed from the center of Rome. The
solution of pre-pointing the telescope to Jupiter and leaving it fixed for 20 m
30 s, allowed to have the correct field of view and to observe successfully the
phenomenon. This was possible because Jupiter was at the same declination of
the target star, and 20m30s of right ascension to the west of it. With
opportune modifications this method can be applied in similar cases, when the
observing equipment is minimal. In that case, for example, many observers could
have been witness of such an event, helping to recover the shadow path across

transition. These edge states are then found to decline with the increase of

the opposite edges couple with each other through the localized states in the

themselves if magnetic disorders are doped which breaks the time-reversal

dynamical balances in the solar Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL). The
differential rotation and meridional circulation are intimately linked, with a
common origin in the turbulent stresses of the upper solar convection zone. The
existence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of
angular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed. Rather, the
turbulent angular momentum transport accounts for the poleward meridional flow
while the often overlooked meridional force balance maintains the mid-latitude
rotational shear. We suggest that the base of the NSSL is marked by a
transition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses in the meridional plane which
suppress Coriolis-induced circulations that would otherwise establish a
cylindrical rotation profile. The turbulent angular momentum transport must be
non-diffusive and directed radially inward. Inferred mean flows are consistent
with the idea that turbulent convection tends to mix angular momentum but only
if the mixing efficiency is inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic. The latitudinal
and longitudinal components of the estimated turbulent transport are comparable
in amplitude and about an order of magnitude larger than the vertical
component. We estimate that it requires 2--4% of the solar luminosity to
maintain the solar NSSL against the inertia of the mean flow. Most of this
energy is associated with the turbulent transport of angular momentum out of
the layer, with a spin-down time scale of $\sim$ 600 days. We also address
implications of these results for numerical modeling of the NSSL.

principle and assuming underlying particle statistics, fermionic or bosonic,
for the excitations of the holographic screen leads to Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND). A connection between the acceleration scale $a_0$ appearing in
MOND and the Fermi energy of the holographic fermionic degrees of freedom is
obtained. In this formulation the physics of MOND results from the
quantum-classical crossover in the fermionic specific heat. However, due to the
dimensionality of the screen, the formalism is general and applies to two
dimensional bosonic excitations as well. It is shown that replacing the
assumption of the equipartition of energy on the holographic screen by a
standard quantum-statistical-mechanics description wherein some of the degrees
of freedom are frozen out at low temperatures is the physical basis for the
MOND interpolating function ${\tilde \mu}$. The interpolating function ${\tilde
\mu}$ is calculated within the statistical mechanical formalism and compared to
the leading phenomenological interpolating functions, most commonly used. Based
on the statistical mechanical view of MOND, its cosmological implications are
re-interpreted: the connection between $a_0$ and the Hubble constant is
described as a quantum uncertainty relation; and the relationship between $a_0$
and the cosmological constant is better understood physically.

resolution of the resultant map is 19"".3, corresponding to 81 pc, which is
sufficient to identify each Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) in the disk. We found
clumpy structures with a typical spatial scale of ~100 pc, corresponding to
GMCs, and no diffuse, smoothly distributed component of molecular gas at this
sensitivity. Closer inspection of the CO and HI maps suggests that not every CO
emission is associated with local HI peaks, particularly in the inner portion
of the disk (r < 2 kpc), although most of CO emission is located at the local
HI peaks in the outer radii. We found that most uncovered GMCs are accompanied
by massive star-forming regions, although the star formation rates (SFRs) vary
widely from cloud to cloud. The azimuthally averaged H{\sc i} gas surface
density exhibits a flat radial distribution. However, the CO radial
distribution shows a significant enhancement within the central 1-2 kpc region,
which is very similar to that of the SFR. We obtained a map of the molecular
fraction, f_mol = Sigma_H_2/(Sigma_HI+Sigma_H_2, at a 100-pc resolution. This
is the first f_mol map covering an entire galaxy with a GMC-scale resolution.
We find that f_mol tends to be high near the center. The correlation between
f_mol and gas surface density shows two distinct sequences. The presence of two
correlation sequences can be explained by differences in metallicity, i.e.,
higher (~ 2-fold) metallicity in the central region (r< 1.5 kpc) than in the
outer parts. Alternatively, differences in scale height can also account for
the two sequences, i.e., increased scale height toward the outer disk.

Ito's prescription in the NPRG framework and eventually provide an adequate
regularization to encode them automatically. Besides, we show how to build a
supersymmetric NPRG formalism with emphasis on time-reversal symmetric
problems, whose supersymmetric structure allows for a particularly simple

the two approaches on the example of Model A within the derivative expansion
approximation at order two, and check that they yield identical results.

(or fluctuations) that are exponentially small as a function of some parameter,
e.g., the number of random components of a system, the time over which a
stochastic system is observed, the amplitude of the noise perturbing a
dynamical system or the temperature of a chemical reaction. The theory has
applications in many different scientific fields, ranging from queuing theory
to statistics and from finance to engineering. It is also increasingly used in
statistical physics for studying both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems.
In this context, deep analogies can be made between familiar concepts of
statistical physics, such as the entropy and the free energy, and concepts of
large deviation theory having more technical names, such as the rate function
and the scaled cumulant generating function. The first part of these notes
introduces the basic elements of large deviation theory at a level appropriate
for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, engineering,
chemistry, and mathematics. The focus there is on the simple but powerful ideas
behind large deviation theory, stated in non-technical terms, and on the
application of these ideas in simple stochastic processes, such as sums of
independent and identically distributed random variables and Markov processes.
Some physical applications of these processes are covered in exercises
contained at the end of each section. In the second part, the problem of
numerically evaluating large deviation probabilities is treated at a basic
level. The fundamental idea of importance sampling is introduced there together
with its sister idea, the exponential change of measure. Other numerical
methods based on sample means and generating functions, with applications to
Markov processes, are also covered.

symmetries of the underlying quantum field theory. To suppress the dependence
of observables on high-energy input, we also consider once- and
twice-subtracted versions of the equations, and identify the subtraction
constants with dipole and quadrupole pion polarizabilities. Based on the
assumption of Mandelstam analyticity, we determine the kinematic range in which
the equations are valid. As an application, we consider the resolution of the
$\gamma\gamma\to\pi\pi$ partial waves by a Muskhelishvili--Omn\`es
representation with finite matching point. We find a sum rule for the
isospin-two $S$-wave, which, together with chiral constraints, produces an
improved prediction for the charged-pion quadrupole polarizability
$(\alpha_2-\beta_2)^{\pi^\pm}=(15.3\pm 3.7)\cdot 10^{-4} {\rm fm}^5$. We
investigate the prediction of our dispersion relations for the two-photon
coupling of the $\sigma$-resonance $\Gamma_{\sigma\gamma\gamma}$. The
twice-subtracted version predicts a correlation between this width and the
isospin-zero pion polarizabilities, which is largely independent of the
high-energy input used in the equations. Using this correlation, the chiral
perturbation theory results for pion polarizabilities, and our new sum rule, we
find $\Gamma_{\sigma\gamma\gamma}=(1.7\pm 0.4)\,{\rm keV}$.

for 4D Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS and higher dimensional Kerr-AdS-dS black holes. We
find that every dual CFT is defined with respect to a rotation in certain
angular direction, along which the translation defines a U(1) Killing symmetry.
In the presence of two sets of U(1) symmetry, the novel CFT duals are generated
by the modular group $SL(2,\mb Z)$, and for $n$ sets of U(1) symmetry there are
general CFT duals generated by T-duality group $SL(n,\mb Z)$.

present new long-baseline spectro-interferometric observations of the HerbigAe
star, HR5999, obtained in the H and K bands with the AMBER instrument at the
VLTI, and aim to produce near-infrared images at the sub-AU spatial scale. We
spatially resolve the circumstellar material and reconstruct images using the
MiRA algorithm. In addition, we interpret the interferometric observations
using models that assume that the near-infrared excess is dominated by the
emission of a circumstellar disk. We compare the images reconstructed from the
VLTI measurements to images obtained using simulated model data. The K-band
image reveals three main elements: a ring-like feature located at ~0.65 AU, a
low surface brightness region inside, and a central spot. At the maximum
angular resolution of our observations (1.3 mas), the ring is resolved while
the central spot is only marginally resolved, preventing us from revealing the
exact morphology of the circumstellar environment. We suggest that the ring
traces silicate condensation, i.e., an opacity change, in a circumstellar disk
around HR 5999. We build a model that includes a ring at the silicate
sublimation radius and an inner disk of low surface brightness responsible for
a large amount of the near-infrared continuum emission. The model successfully
fits the SED, visibilities, and closure phases, and provides evidence of a low
surface brightness region inside the silicate sublimation radius. This study
provides additional evidence that in HerbigAe stars, there is material in a low
surface brightness region, probably a low optical depth region, located inside
the silicate sublimation radius and of unknown nature.

hard X-rays from various targets using a kHz short pulse laser at intensities
above 1014Wcm-2 (A). Most of these studies have been carried out in vacuum and
very many fewer studies have been carried out in air. Recently this lack has
been partially addressed with the development of femtosecond laser
micromachining. Another similar although apparently unconnected field (B) deals
with the channelling of high power laser beam in filaments after passage
through long distances in air. This has been largely driven by the construction
of a mobile terawatt laser beam (Teramobile) for atmospheric studies. The laser
beams in these two cases (A and B) have very different pulse energies (mJ
against J) although the filaments in (B) have similar energies to (A) and are
clamped at intensities less than 1014 Wcm-2. This paper has been written to
compare the production of hard X-rays in these two cases. The conclusion is
interesting that a focused sub TW laser pulse in air reaches intensities
sufficiently high that characteristic K and L X-rays are generated from a
number of metal and non metal targets as well as a continuous bremsstrahlung
spectrum. On the other hand the clamping of the multi-filaments in a 100 TW
laser beam in air cannot generate hard Xrays especially when propagated over
long distances.

duality. Non-relativistically, the only conservation law relevant to the
hydrodynamic approximation is the energy-momentum conservation.
Relativistically, one has to introduce an extra conserved U(1) current and an
extra three-dimensional scalar field which is condensed. Finding out a proper
U(1) symmetry becomes a crucial point. We emphasize that in dual models there
do arise extra U(1) symmetries associated with wrapping of the strings around
(extra) compact directions in Euclidean space-time. Moreover, if the geometry
associated with an extra compact dimension is cigar-like then the corresponding
U(1) symmetry could well be spontaneously broken. The emerging Goldstone
particle survives in the hydrodynamic limit. A specific point is that the
chemical potential conjugated with the corresponding U(1) charge is vanishing.
Within the standard approach the vanishing chemical potential implies no
superfluidity. We argue that an exotic liquid, introduced recently in the
literature, with vanishing energy density and non-vanishing pressure represents
a viable description of the liquid associated with 3d Goldstone particles in
Euclidean space-time. Since it lives on the stretched membrane, it describes
energy-momentum transport in the deep infrared. We discuss briefly possible
applications to the quark-gluon plasma.

the promise that molecular energy levels can be explored at bias voltages lower
than required for resonant tunneling. We investigate the theoretical basis of
this novel tool, using a generic model. In particular, we study the length
dependence of the conducting frontier orbital and of the 'transition voltage'
as a function of length. We show that this dependence is influenced by the
amount of screening of the electrons in the molecule, which determines the
voltage drop to be located at the contacts or across the entire molecule. We
observe that the transition voltage depends significantly on the length, but
that the ratio between the transition voltage and the conducting frontier
orbital is approximately constant only in strongly screening (conjugated)
molecules. Uncertainty about the screening within a molecule thus limits the
predictive power of TVS. We furthermore argue that the relative length
independence of the transition voltage for non-conjugated chains is due to
strong localization of the frontier orbitals on the end groups ensuring binding
of the rods to the metallic contacts. Finally, we investigate the
characteristics of TVS in asymmetric molecular junctions. If a single level
dominates the transport properties, TVS can provide a good estimate for both
the level position and the degree of junction asymmetry. If more levels are
involved the applicability of TVS becomes limited.

Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the velocity and temperature fields using the
Snapshot Method on the basis of a direct numerical simulation (DNS). The
resulting LDM is a quadratic inhomogeneous system of coupled ordinary
differential equations which we use to describe the long-time temporal
evolution of the large-scale mode amplitudes for a Rayleigh number of 1e5 and a
Prandtl number of 0.7. The truncation to a finite number of degrees of freedom,
that does not exceed a number of 310 for the present, requires the additional
implementation of an eddy viscosity-diffusivity to capture the missing
dissipation of the small-scale modes. The magnitude of this additional
dissipation mechanism is determined by requiring statistical stationarity and a
total dissipation that corresponds with the original DNS data. We compare the
performance of two models, a constant so-called Heisenberg
viscosity--diffusivity and a mode-dependent or modal one. The latter
viscosity--diffusivity model turns out to reproduce the large-scale properties
of the turbulent convection qualitatively well, even for a model with only a

The main distribution used for a bump search is the dijet invariant mass
distribution with appropriated cuts. The crucial cut, which is applied to
maximize signal significance, is on (pseudo)rapidity difference between the two
jets. This is due to the exponential growing of the QCD background contribution
with this variable. Usually it is assumed that signal from almost all exotic
models populates the central dijet rapidity region y_{1,2} ~ 0 and |y_1-y_2| ~
0. By contrast, the excited bosons do not contribute into this region, but
produce an excess of dijet events over the almost flat QCD background in chi =
exp|y_1-y_2| away from this region. Therefore, different sets of cuts should be
applied for new physics search depending on the searched resonance properties.
In order to confirm the bump and reveal the resonance nature various angular
distributions should be used in addition. In particular, for the excited bosons
the special choice of parameters could lead to a dip in the centrality ratio
distribution over the dijet invariant mass instead of a bump, expected in the
most exotic models.

(2008 March and 2010 March). Obvious Zeeman signatures are detected at all
times, both in photospheric lines and in accretion-powered emission lines.
Significant intrinsic variability and moderate rotational modulation is
observed in both photospheric and accretion proxies.
  Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field, of
the photospheric brightness and of the accretion-powered emission at the
surface of TWHya at both epochs. We find that the magnetic topology is mostly
poloidal and axisymmetric with respect to the rotation axis of the star, and
that the octupolar component of the large-scale field (2.5-2.8kG at the pole)
largely dominates the dipolar component. This large-scale field topology is
characteristic of partly-convective stars, supporting the conclusion (from
evolutionary models) that TWHya already hosts a radiative core. We also show
that TWHya features a high-latitude photospheric cool spot overlapping with the
main magnetic pole (and producing the observed radial velocity fluctuations);
this is also where accretion concentrates most of the time, although accretion
at lower latitudes is found to occur episodically.
  We propose that the relatively rapid rotation of TWHya (with respect to
AATau-like cTTSs) directly reflects the weakness of the large-scale dipole, no
longer capable of magnetically disrupting the accretion disc up to the
corotation radius (at which the Keplerian period equals the stellar rotation
period). We therefore conclude that TWHya is in a phase of rapid spin-up as its
large-scale dipole field progressively vanishes.

forbid unwanted or dangerous couplings. A classical example is the R-parity of
the MSSM, which guarantees the absence of dimension four baryon- and
lepton-number violating operators. Although phenomenologically useful, these
discrete symmetries are, in the context of field theory, poorly motivated at a
more fundamental level. Moreover, discrete {\em global} symmetries are expected
to be violated in consistent couplings to quantum gravity, while their {\em
gauged} versions are expected to actually exist. In this paper we study
discrete gauge symmetries in brane models in string theory, and argue that they
are fairly generic in this framework. In particular we study the appearance of
discrete gauge symmetries in (MS)SM brane constructions in string theory, and
show that a few discrete ${Z_N}$ gauge symmetries, including R-parity and {\it
baryon triality}, appear naturally as remnants of continuous U(1) gauge
symmetries with St\""uckelberg $N(B\wedge F)$ couplings. Interestingly, they
correspond to the simplest anomaly-free discrete symmetries of the MSSM as
classified in the early 90's. We provide a number of examples based on type IIA
intersecting brane constructions with a (MS)SM spectrum. We also study the
appearance of discrete generalizations of R-parity in unified SU(5) type IIA

periodic nanoscale defects in graphene, the structural, mechanical and
electronic properties of defect-patterned graphene nanomeshes including diverse
morphologies of adatoms and holes are investigated by means of first-principles
calculations within density functional theory. It is found that various
patterns of adatom groups yield metallic or semimetallic, even semiconducting
behavior and specific patterns can be in a magnetic state. Even though the
patterns of single adatoms dramatically alter the electronic structure of
graphene, adatom groups of specific symmetry can maintain the Dirac fermion
behavior. Nanoholes forming nanomesh are also investigated. Depending on the
interplay between the repeat periodicity and the geometry of the hole, the
nanomesh can be in different states ranging from metallic to semiconducting
including semimetallic state with the bands crossing linearly at the Fermi
level. We showed that forming periodically repeating superstructures in
graphene matrix can develop a promising technique to engineer nanomaterials
with desired electronic and magnetic properties.

triplet molecules is drawing attention due to its applicability for weak
incident light, possessing a potential for improving overall efficiencies of
solar energy conversion devices. Since energy transfer between triplet levels
of different molecules or TTA requires electron exchange between molecules by
the Dexter mechanism, inter-molecular collision is necessary and hence the
majority of previous studies have been done with volatile organic solvents as
fluidic media. This paper presents the development and characterization of a
new class of TTA-based photon upconverters with ionic liquids (ILs), which are
room temperature molten salts with negligible vapor pressure and high thermal
stability. The fabricated samples are found to be stable and the solvation
mechanism of the molecules in ILs is proposed. The upconversion quantum yield
(UC-QY) is IL dependent and the maximum value observed was approximately 10 %
for red-to-blue upconversion. An analytical model was developed to explain the
experimental results based on the assumption of efficient energy transfer
between molecules. The model agrees with the observed relationship between the
excitation intensity and UC-QY, showing that viscosities of the ILs are not a
practical problem for the usage of TTA-based photon upconversion.

interesting behaviors. Here we reveal that in this regime there exists a novel
QPT: namely, from a phase without a bound state to a phase with a bound state,
which leads to completely different dynamical behaviors in these two phases. If
the reservoir is initially in the displaced vacuum state (i.e., the coherent
state), the spin dynamics exhibits lossless oscillation when the bound state
exists; otherwise, the oscillation will decay completely. This result is
compatible with the coherence-incoherence transition occurring in the
small-tunneling limit. Our work indicates that the QPT physics in the
spin-boson model needs further exploration.

  Astrophysics & Space Science",,"10.1007/s10509-011-0783-x",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Star formation is thought to be triggered by gravitational collapse of the
dense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the
collapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which
eventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a
central mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum
transport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through
this disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of
their mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular
momentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a
companion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive
discs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity
driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated
centrifugally from the surfaces of the disc. Both processes are powered by the
action of magnetic fields and are, in turn, likely to strongly affect the
structure, dynamics, evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their
host discs. The weak ionisation of protostellar discs, however, may prevent the
magnetic field from effectively coupling to the gas and shear and driving these
processes. Here I examine the viability and properties of these
magnetically-driven processes in protostellar discs. The results indicate that,
despite the weak ionisation, the magnetic field is able to couple to the gas
and shear for fluid conditions thought to be satisfied over a wide range of
radii in these discs.

that \Psi(\tau) has moments of arbitrary order. This implies, in particular,
that even in this simplest case (not saying about complex systems and/or

observed a sample of 48 galaxies from the Local Universe with the PPAK Integral
Field Spectroscopy unit (IFU), of the PMAS spectrograph, mounted at the 3.5m
telescope at Calar Alto Observatory (Almeria, Spain). Two different setups were
used during these studies (low -V300- and medium -V600- resolution mode)
covering a spectral range of around 3700-7000 Angs. We developed a full
automatic pipeline for the data reduction, that includes an analysis of the
quality of the final data products. We applied a decoupling method to obtain
the ionised gas and stellar content of these galaxies, and to derive the main
physical properties of the galaxies. To asses the accuracy in the measurements
of the different parameters, we performed a set of simulations to derive the
expected relative errors obtained with these data. In addition, we extracted
two aperture, central and integrated spectra, from the datacubes. The main
properties of the stellar populations and ionised gas of these galaxies and an
estimate of their relative errors are derived from those spectra, as well as
from the whole datacubes. Results: The comparison of the central spectrum
extracted from the datacubes and the SDSS spectrum for those galaxies in common
shows a good agreement between the derived values from both samples. We find
differences in the properties of galaxies when comparing a central and an
integrated spectra, showing the effects of the extracted aperture in the
interpretation of the data. Finally, we present two dimensional maps of some of
the main properties derived with the decoupling procedure.

on the ranks of the elements. These rank-driven processes are inspired by
variants of the Bak--Sneppen model of evolution, in which the system represents
an evolutionary 'fitness landscape' and which is famous as a simple model
displaying self-organized criticality. Our main results are concerned with
long-time large-$N$ asymptotics for the general model in which, at each time
step, $K$ randomly chosen elements are discarded and replaced by independent
$U[0,1]$ variables, where the ranks of the elements to be replaced are chosen,
independently at each time step, according to a distribution $\kappa_N$ on
$\{1,2,...,N\}^K$. Our main results are that, under appropriate conditions on
$\kappa_N$, the system exhibits threshold behaviour at $s^* \in [0,1]$, where
$s^*$ is a function of $\kappa_N$, and the marginal distribution of a randomly
selected element converges to $U[s^*, 1]$ as $t \to \infty$ and $N \to \infty$.
Of this class of models, results in the literature have previously been given
for special cases only, namely the 'mean-field' or 'random neighbour'
Bak--Sneppen model. Our proofs avoid the heuristic arguments of some of the
previous work and use Foster--Lyapunov ideas. Our results extend existing
results and establish their natural, more general context. We derive some more
specialized results for the particular case where K=2. One of our technical
tools is a result on convergence of stationary distributions for families of
uniformly ergodic Markov chains on increasing state-spaces, which may be of
independent interest.

by storms of impulsive nanoflares. The nature of coronal heating in hotter
loops and in the very important but largely ignored diffuse component of active
regions is much less clear. Are these regions also heated impulsively, or is
the heating quasi steady? The spectacular new data from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) telescopes on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) offer an
excellent opportunity to address this question. We analyze the light curves of
coronal loops and the diffuse corona in 6 different AIA channels and compare
them with the predicted light curves from theoretical models. Light curves in
the different AIA channels reach their peak intensities with predictable
orderings as a function the nanoflare storm properties. We show that while some
sets of light curves exhibit clear evidence of cooling after nanoflare storms,
other cases are less straightforward to interpret. Complications arise because
of line-of-sight integration through many different structures, the broadband
nature of the AIA channels, and because physical properties can change
substantially depending on the magnitude of the energy release. Nevertheless,
the light curves exhibit predictable and understandable patterns consistent
with impulsive nanoflare heating.

being corrected for absorption in the extragalactic background light (EBL),
appear unusually hard, which poses challenges to conventional acceleration and
emission models. We investigate the parameter space that allows the production
of such hard TeV spectra within time-dependent leptonic models, both for
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC) scenarios. In the
context of interpretation of very hard $\gamma$-ray spectra, time-dependent
considerations become crucial because even extremely hard, initial electron
distributions can be significantly deformed due to radiative energy losses. We
show that very steep VHE spectra can be avoided if adiabatic losses are taken
into account. Another way to keep extremely hard electron distributions in the
presence of radiative losses, is to assume stochastic acceleration models that
naturally lead to steady-state relativistic, Maxwellian-type particle
distributions. We demonstrate that in either case leptonic models can reproduce
TeV spectra as hard as $E_{\gamma} dN/dE_{\gamma} \propto E_{\gamma}$.
Unfortunately this limits, to a large extend, the potential of extracting EBL
from $\gamma$-ray observations of blazars.

from levels up to 1500 K above the ground state, enabling identification of
source(s) responsible for heating the region. We used this multi-transition
dataset to produce images of the rotational/kinetic temperature and the column
density of ammonia for ortho and para species separately and on a
position-by-position basis. We find rotational temperature and column density
in the range 160-490 K and (1-4)x10^17 cm^-2, respectively. Our
spatially-resolved images show that the highest (column) density and hottest
gas is found in a northeast-southwest elongated ridge to the southeast of
Source I. We have also measured the ortho-para ratio of ammonia, estimated to
vary in the range 0.9-1.6. Enhancement of ortho with respect to para and the
offset of hot ammonia emission peaks from known (proto)stellar sources provide
evidence that the ammonia molecules have been released from dust grains into
the gas-phase through the passage of shocks and not by stellar radiation. We
propose that the combined effect of Source I's proper motion and its
low-velocity outflow impinging on a pre-existing dense medium is responsible
for the excitation of ammonia and the Orion Hot Core. Finally, we found for the

Here, we show that Markov models are a natural consequence of the dynamical
principle of Maximum Caliber. First, we show that when there are different
possible dynamical trajectories in a time-homogeneous process, then the only
type of process that maximizes the path entropy, for any given singlet
statistics, is a sequence of identical, independently distributed (i.i.d.)
random variables, which is the simplest Markov process. If the data is in the
form of sequentially pairwise statistics, then maximizing the caliber dictates
that the process is Markovian with a uniform initial distribution. Furthermore,
if an initial non-uniform dynamical distribution is known, or multiple
trajectories are conditioned on an initial state, then the Markov process is
still the only one that maximizes the caliber. Second, given a model, MaxCal
can be used to compute the parameters of that model. We show that this
procedure is equivalent to the maximum-likelihood method of inference in the
theory of statistics.

becoming critical to the efficient utilization of HPC systems at large scale.
HPC applications typically tolerate fail-stop failures by checkpointing.
Another promising method is in the algorithm level, called algorithmic
recovery. These two methods can achieve high efficiency when the system scale
is not very large, but will both lose their effectiveness when systems approach
the scale of Exaflops, where the number of processors including in system is
expected to achieve one million. This paper develops a new and efficient
algorithm-based fault tolerance scheme for HPC applications. When failure
occurs during the execution, we do not stop to wait for the recovery of
corrupted data, but replace them with the corresponding redundant data and
continue the execution. A background accelerated recovery method is also
proposed to rebuild redundancy to tolerate multiple times of failures during
the execution. To demonstrate the feasibility of our new scheme, we have
incorporated it to the High Performance Linpack. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our new fault tolerance scheme can still be effective even
when the system scale achieves the Exaflops. Experiment using SiCortex SC5832
verifies the feasibility of the scheme, and indicates that the advantage of our
scheme can be observable even in a small scale.

to investigate the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Scanning

the superconducting pairing mechanism. A particularly well suited material to
apply this technique is the stoichiometric superconductor LiFeAs as it features
clean, charge neutral cleaved surfaces without surface states and a relatively
high Tc~18K. Our data reveal that in LiFeAs the quasiparticle scattering is
governed by a van-Hove singularity at the center of the Brillouin zone which is
in stark contrast with other pnictide superconductors where nesting is crucial
for both scattering and s+- superconductivity. Indeed, within a minimal model
and using the most elementary order parameters, calculations of the QPI suggest
a dominating role of the hole-like bands for the quasiparticle scattering. Our
theoretical findings do not support the elementary singlet pairing symmetries
s++, s+-, and d-wave. This brings to mind that the superconducting pairing
mechanism in LiFeAs is based on an unusual pairing symmetry such as an
elementary p-wave (which provides optimal agreement between the experimental
data and QPI simulations) or a more complex order parameter (e.g. s+id-wave

terms of the rotation vector for different types %generalized potential of
AFMs. Basing on the analysis of linearized equations of motion we predict the
current-induced reorientation and AFM resonance, and found the values of
critical currents in terms of AFMR frequencies and damping constants. We show
the possibility of current-induced spin-diode effect and second-harmonic
generation in AF layer. The proposed approach is generalized for the

for an experiment with a circular scanning strategy, specifically in this case
for the analysis of Planck data, and to quantify the effects of making maps
using simplified approximations to the true beams. Methods. We present an
implementation of a map-making algorithm which allows the combined treatment of
temperature and polarisation data, and removal of instrumental effects, such as
detector time constants and finite sampling intervals, as well as the
deconvolution of arbitrarily complex beams from the maps. This method may be
applied to any experiment with a circular scanning-strategy. Results.
Low-resolution experiments were used to demonstrate the ability of this method
to remove the effects of arbitrary beams from the maps and to demonstrate the
effects on the maps of ignoring beam asymmetries. Additionally, results are
presented of an analysis of a realistic full-scale simulated data-set for the
Planck LFI 30 GHz channel. Conclusions. Our method successfully removes the
effects of the beams from the maps, and although it is computationally
expensive, the analysis of the Planck LFI data should be feasible with this
approach.

structures. The generation of primordial inhomogeneities during inflation can
be understood via the spontaneous creation of quanta from the vacuum. We show
that when the corresponding {\it stimulated} creation of quanta is considered,
the characteristics of the state of the universe at the onset of inflation are
not diluted by the inflationary expansion and can be imprinted in the spectrum
of primordial inhomogeneities. The non-gaussianities (particularly in the
so-called squeezed configuration) in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy
distribution can then tell us about the state of the universe that existed at
the time when quantum field theory in curved spacetime first emerged as a
plausible effective theory.

several 0.2 to 2.6m telescopes around the world to monitor continuously young
(< 100 Myr), nearby (< 1 kpc) stellar clusters mainly to detect young
transiting planets (and to study other variability phenomena on time-scales
from minutes to years). The telescope network enables us to observe the targets
continuously for several days in order not to miss any transit. The runs are
typically one to two weeks long, about three runs per year per cluster in two
or three subsequent years for about ten clusters. There are thousands of stars
detectable in each field with several hundred known cluster members, e.g. in
the first cluster observed, Tr-37, a typical cluster for the YETI survey, there
are at least 469 known young stars detected in YETI data down to R=16.5 mag
with sufficient precision of 50 milli-mag rms (5 mmag rms down to R=14.5 mag)
to detect transits, so that we can expect at least about one young transiting
object in this cluster. If we observe 10 similar clusters, we can expect to
detect approximately 10 young transiting planets with radius determinations.
The precision given above is for a typical telescope of the YETI network,
namely the 60/90-cm Jena telescope (similar brightness limit, namely within
+/-1 mag, for the others) so that planetary transits can be detected. For
planets with mass and radius determinations, we can calculate the mean density
and probe the internal structure. We aim to constrain planet formation models
and their time-scales by discovering planets younger than 100 Myr and
determining not only their orbital parameters, but also measuring their true
masses and radii, which is possible so far only by the transit method. Here, we
present an overview and first results. (Abstract shortened)
