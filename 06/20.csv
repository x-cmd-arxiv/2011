for a discrete-time linear stochastic system with multiplicative noise, on a

necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the optimal control

show that if the optimal control exists, then certain Lyapunov equations must
have a solution. The optimal control is obtained by solving a deterministic
linear-quadratic optimal control problem whose functional depends on the
solution to the Lyapunov equations. Moreover, we show that under certain

that, if the frequency inequalities are strict, then the solution is unique up
to equivalence.

outer automorphism groups. For 12 of the 26 possible isomorphism types of a
sporadic simple group G, the outer automorphism group Out(G) has order 2, and
in the remaining 14 cases, Out(G) is trivial. Historically the suspicion of the
existence of a sporadic group was followed in fairly short order by the
calculation of a good upper bound on the size of its outer automorphism group.
In a few cases establishing the existence of certain outer automorphisms, like
the existence of the groups themselves, presented difficulties overcome only
with the use of machine computation. In any case these calculations can be
difficult to track down in the literature. This note, which contains nothing
new, is only intended to bring together these calculations. It also answers a
question of Bob Oliver about the automorphism groups of some of these groups,
how they might be calculated, and specifically whether the Sylow 2-subgroups of
a sporadic simple group are self-centralizing in the automorphism group of the
simple group. The answer is that they are.

constructing a cellular model of the configuration space of a sphere. In
particular, it was shown that the classifying space (order complex) of the face
poset of a totally normal regular cellular stratified space $X$ can be embedded
in $X$ as a strong deformation retract.
  Here we elaborate on this idea and develop the theory of cellular stratified
spaces. We introduce the notion of cylindrically normal cellular stratified
spaces and associate a topological category $C(X)$, called the face category,
to such a stratified space $X$. We show that the classifying space $BC(X)$ of
$C(X)$ can be naturally embedded into $X$. When $X$ is a cell complex, the
embedding is a homeomorphism and we obtain an extension of the barycentric
subdivision of regular cell complexes. Furthermore, when the cellular
stratification on $X$ is locally polyhedral, we show that $BC(X)$ is a
deformation retract of $X$.

results in this paper can be regarded as a common framework for the Salvetti

$S_{BG}=-k_B \sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$. The BG entropy is {\it additive},
meaning that, if A and B are two probabilistically independent systems, then
$S_{BG}(A+B)=S_{BG}(A)+S_{BG}(B)$. The words, {\it extensive} and {\it
additive}, were practically treated, for over more than one century, as almost
synonyms, and $S_{BG}$ was considered to be the unique form that $S$ could
take. In other words, the functional $S_{BG}$ was considered to be universal.
It has become increasingly clear today that it is {\it not} so, and that those
two words are {\it not} synonyms, but happen to coincide whenever we are
dealing with paradigmatic Hamiltonians involving {\it short-range} interactions
between their elements, presenting no strong frustration and other
""pathologies"". These facts constitute the basis of a generalization of the BG
entropy and statistical mechanics, introduced in 1988, and frequently referred
to as nonadditive entropy $S_q$ and nonextensive statistical mechanics,
respectively. We briefly review herein these points, and exhibit recent as well
as typical applications of these concepts in natural, artificial, and social
systems, as shown through theoretical, experimental, observational and
computational predictions and verifications.

inhomogeneous universes admitting linearly polarized gravitational waves) is
analyzed within Loop Quantum Cosmology by means of an effective dynamics. The
analysis, performed via analytical and numerical methods, proves that the
behavior found in the evolution of vacuum (homogeneous) Bianchi I universes is
preserved qualitatively also in the presence of inhomogeneities. More
precisely, the initial singularity is replaced by a big bounce which joins
deterministically two large classical universes. In addition, we show that the
size of the universe at the bounce is at least of the same order of magnitude
(roughly speaking) as the size of the corresponding homogeneous universe
obtained in the absence of gravitational waves. In particular, a precise lower
bound for the ratio of these two sizes is found. Finally, the comparison of the
amplitudes of the gravitational wave modes in the distant future and past shows
that, statistically (i.e., for large samples of universes), the difference in
amplitude is enhanced for nearly homogeneous universes, whereas this difference
vanishes in inhomogeneity dominated cases. The presented analysis constitutes
the first systematic effective study of an inhomogeneous system within Loop
Quantum Cosmology, and it proves the robustness of the results obtained for
homogeneous cosmologies in this context.

observe Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). GRBs are the most luminous electromagnetic
events in the universe and occur randomly in any direction. Therefore the UFFO
consists of two telescopes; UFFO Burst Alert & Trigger Telescope (UBAT) to
detect GRBs using a wide field-of-view (FOV), and a Slewing Mirror Telescope
(SMT) to observe UV/optical events rapidly within the narrow, targeted FOV. The
SMT is a Ritchey-Chretien telescope that uses a motorized mirror system and an
Intensified Charge-Coupled Device (ICCD). When the GRB is triggered by the
UBAT, the SMT receives the position information and rapidly tilts the mirror to
the target. The ICCD start to take the data within a second after GRB is
triggered. Here we give the details about the SMT readout electronics that
deliver the data.

Previous work has shown that flow sampling (FS) offers enormous statistical

large extent, provide FS-like statistical performance by approaching FS
continuously, with just packet-sampling-like computational cost. Our work
utilizes a Fisher information based approach recently used to evaluate a number

show how DS significantly outperforms other packet based methods, including
Sample and Hold, the closest packet sampling-based competitor to FS. We
describe a packet sampling-based implementation of DS and analyze its key

system is bounded from above by a quarter of the area $A$ of a circumscribing
surface measured in Planck areas. This bound is widely regarded as part of the
elusive fundamental theory of nature. In fact, the bound is known to be valid
for generic weakly gravitating isolated systems in {\it three} spatial
dimensions. Nevertheless, the entropy content of a physical system is expected
to be an increasing function of the number of spatial dimensions (the more the
dimensions, the more ways there are to split up a given amount of energy).
Thus, one may expect the challenge to the holographic entropy bound to become
more and more serious as the number of spatial dimensions increases. In this
paper we explicitly show that thermal radiation in $D$ flat spatial dimensions
with $D\gtrsim 10^2$ may indeed violate the holographic entropy bound.

the progressive model and the non-progressive model (see e.g. the seminal work
of Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos in KDD 2003). While the progressive models are
suitable for modeling the spread of influence in monopolistic settings,
non-progressive are more appropriate for modeling non-monopolistic settings,
e.g., modeling diffusion of two competing technologies over a social network.
Despite the extensive work on the progressive model, non-progressive models
have not been studied well. In this paper, we study the spread of influence in
the non-progressive model under the strict majority threshold: given a graph
$G$ with a set of initially infected nodes, each node gets infected at time
$\tau$ iff a majority of its neighbors are infected at time $\tau-1$. Our goal
in the \textit{MinPTS} problem is to find a minimum-cardinality initial set of
infected nodes that would eventually converge to a steady state where all nodes
of $G$ are infected.
  We prove that while the MinPTS is NP-hard for a restricted family of graphs,
it admits an improved constant-factor approximation algorithm for power-law
graphs. We do so by proving lower and upper bounds in terms of the minimum and
maximum degree of nodes in the graph. The upper bound is achieved in turn by
applying a natural greedy algorithm. Our experimental evaluation of the greedy
algorithm also shows its superior performance compared to other algorithms for
a set of real-world graphs as well as the random power-law graphs. Finally, we
study the convergence properties of these algorithms and show that the
non-progressive model converges in at most $O(|E(G)|)$ steps.

Saturn were formed in the circum-Saturn disk. Thus, if these mid-sized
satellites were simply accreted by collisions of similar ice-rock
satellitesimals in the disk, the observed wide diversity in density (i.e., the
rock fraction) of the Saturnian mid-sized satellites is enigmatic. A recent
circumplanetary disk model suggests satellite growth in an actively supplied
circumplanetary disk, in which Titan-sized satellites migrate inward by
interaction with the gas and are eventually lost to the gas planet. Here we
report numerical simulations of giant impacts between Titan-sized migrating
satellites and smaller satellites in the inner region of the Saturnian disk.
Our results suggest that in a giant impact with impact velocity > 1.4 times the
escape velocity and impact angle of ~45 degree, a smaller satellite is
destroyed, forming multiple mid-sized satellites with a very wide diversity in
satellite density (the rock fraction = 0-92 wt%). Our results of the
relationship between the mass and rock fraction of the satellites resulting
from giant impacts reproduce the observations of the Saturnian mid-sized
satellites. Giant impacts also lead to internal melting of the formed mid-sized
satellites, which would initiate strong tidal dissipation and geological
activity, such as those observed on Enceladus today and Tethys in the past. Our
findings also imply that giant impacts might have affected the fundamental
physical property of the Saturnian mid-sized satellites as well as those of the
terrestrial planets in the solar system and beyond.

of the main steps in electrodynamics of materials. In spite of the fundamental
importance of the averaging procedure, it is quite rarely properly discussed in
university courses and respective books; up to now there is no established
consensus about how the averaging procedure has to be performed. In this paper
we show that there are some basic principles for the averaging procedure
(irrespective to what type of material is studied) which have to be satisfied.
Any homogenization model has to be consistent with the basic principles. In
case of absence of this correlation of a particular model with the basic
principles the model could not be accepted as a credible one. Another goal of
this paper is to establish the averaging procedure for metamaterials, which is
rather close to the case of compound materials but should include magnetic
response of the inclusions and their clusters. We start from the consideration
of bulk materials, which means in the vast majority of cases that we consider
propagation of an electromagnetic wave far from the interfaces, where the
eigenwave in the medium has been already formed and stabilized. A basic
structure for discussion about boundary conditions and layered metamaterials is
a subject of separate publication and will be done elsewhere.

much attention in view of their importance for material characterization,
nondestructive testing, and geophysics. Due to the progress in measurement
techniques in recent years it has been revealed that rocks can demonstrate
extremely high strain sensitivity of seismo-acoustic loss. In particular, it
has been found that strains of order $10^{-8}$ produced by lunar and solar
tides are capable to cause variations in the seismoacoustic decrement on the
order of several percents. Some laboratory data (although obtained for higher
frequencies) also indicate the presence of very high dissipative nonlinearity.
Conventionally discussed dissipation mechanisms (thermoelastic loss in dry
solids, Biot and squirt-type loss in fluid-saturated ones) do not suffice to
interpret such data. Here, the dissipation at individual cracks is revised
taking into account the influence of wavy asperities of their surfaces quite
typical of real cracks, which can drastically change the values of the
relaxation frequencies and can result in giant strain sensitivity of the
dissipation without the necessity to assume the presence of unrealistically
thin (and, therefore, unrealistically soft) cracks. In particular, these
mechanisms suggest interpretation for observations of pronounced amplitude
modulation of seismo-acoustic waves by tidal strains.

at 199 distinct locations, including urban and rural sites covering all 18
Administrative Districts of Hong Kong. The survey shows that the environmental
light pollution problem in Hong Kong is severe - the urban night-skies (sky
brightness at 15.0 mag per arcsec square) are on average ~100 times brighter
than at the darkest rural sites (20.1 mag per arcsec square), indicating that
the high lighting densities in the densely populated residential and commercial
areas lead to light pollution. In the worst polluted urban location studied,
the night-sky at 13.2 mag per arcsec square can be over 500 times brighter than
the darkest sites in Hong Kong. The observed night-sky brightness is found to
be affected by human factors such as land utilization and population density of
the observation sites, together with meteorological and/or environmental
factors. Moreover, earlier night-skies (at 9:30pm local time) are generally
brighter than later time (at 11:30pm), which can be attributed to some public
and commercial lightings being turned off later at night. On the other hand, no
concrete relationship between the observed sky brightness and air pollutant
concentrations could be established with the limited survey sampling. Results
from this survey will serve as an important database for the public to assess
whether new rules and regulations are necessary to control the use of outdoor

an armchair-edge graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) between two ferromagnetic (FM)
leads with arbitrary polarization directions at low temperatures, where a
magnetic insulator is deposited on the AGNR to induce an exchange splitting
between spin-up and -down carriers. By using the standard nonequilibrium
Green's function (NGF) technique, it is demonstrated that, the spin-resolved
transport property for the system depends sensitively on both the width of AGNR
and the polarization strength of FM leads. The tunneling magnetoresistance
(TMR) around zero bias voltage possesses a pronounced plateau structure for
system with semiconducting 7-AGNR or metallic 8-AGNR in the absence of exchange
splitting, but this plateau structure for 8-AGNR system is remarkably broader
than that for 7-AGNR one. Interestingly, the increase of exchange splitting
$\Delta$ suppresses the amplitude of the structure for 7-AGNR system. However,
the TMR is enhanced much for 8-AGNR system under the bias amplitude comparable
to splitting strength. Further, the current-induced spin transfer torque (STT)
for 7-AGNR system is systematically larger than that for 8-AGNR one. The
findings here suggest the design of GNR-based spintronic devices by using a
metallic AGNR, but it is more favorable to fabricate a current-controlled
magnetic memory element by using a semiconducting AGNR.

ways in which two objects can be discerned from one another, using the
non-logical vocabulary of the language concerned. (These definitions are based
on definitions made by Quine and Saunders.) Because of our use of the
Hilbert-Bernays account, these definitions are in terms of the syntax of the
language. But we also relate our definitions to the idea of permutations on the
domain of quantification, and their being symmetries. These relations turn out
to be subtle---some natural conjectures about them are false. We will see in
particular that the idea of symmetry meshes with a species of indiscernibility
that we will call `absolute indiscernibility'. We then report all the logical
implications between our four kinds of discernibility. We use these four kinds
as a resource for stating four metaphysical theses about identity. Three of
these theses articulate two traditional philosophical themes: viz. the
principle of the identity of indiscernibles (which will come in two versions),
and haecceitism. The fourth is recent. Its most notable feature is that it
makes diversity (i.e. non-identity) weaker than what we will call individuality
(being an individual): two objects can be distinct but not individuals. For
this reason, it has been advocated both for quantum particles and for spacetime
points. Finally, we locate this fourth metaphysical thesis in a broader
position, which we call structuralism. We conclude with a discussion of the
semantics suitable for a structuralist, with particular reference to physical
theories as well as elementary model theory.

\gg\theta_c\equiv {2}/{\sqrt{\hat q L^3}}$, the interference between the
medium--induced gluon emissions by the quark and the antiquark is suppressed
with respect to the direct emissions. This is so since direct emissions are
delocalized throughout the medium and thus yield contributions proportional to
$L$ while interference occurs only between emissions at early times, when both
sources remain coherent. Thus, for $\tqq \gg\theta_c$, the medium-induced
radiation is the sum of the two spectra individually produced by the quark and
the antiquark, without coherence effects like angular ordering. For $\tqq
\ll\theta_c$, the medium--induced radiation vanishes.

black holes make up the dark matter component of the Universe. A near critical
density of compact bodies implies that most lines of sight will be
gravitationally microlensed, and the paper focuses on looking for the predicted
effects on quasar brightness and spectral variations. These signatures of
microlensing include the shape of the Fourier power spectrum of the light
curves, near achromatic and statistically symmetric variations, and the absence
of time dilation in the timescale of variability. For spectral changes, as the
continuum varies there should be little corresponding change in the strength of
the broad lines. In all these cases, the observations are found to be
consistent with the predictions for microlensing by a population of stellar
mass compact bodies. For multiply lensed quasars where the images vary
independently it is shown that stellar populations are too small to produce the
observed microlensing effects, implying a population of compact dark matter
bodies of around a stellar mass along the line of sight. The most serious
objection to dark matter in the form of compact bodies has come from
observations of microlensing of stars in the Magellanic Clouds. In this paper
the expected event rate is re-analysed using more recent values for the
structure and dynamics of the Galactic halo, and it is shown that there is then
no conflict with the observations. Finally, the possible identity of a near
critical density of dark matter in the form of stellar mass compact bodies is
reviewed, with the conclusion that by far the most plausible candidates are
primordial black holes formed during the QCD epoch. The overall conclusion of
the paper is that primordial black holes should be seen alongside elementary
particles as viable dark matter candidates.

the fundamental nature of ontologies implies that ontologies describe only
asserted and veracious facts of the world. Different probabilistic, fuzzy and

most popular tools. However none of the tools meets exactly our purposes.
Therefore, we constructed a Dempster-Shafer ontology that can be imported into

Any function can be viewed as a martingale (in many different ways) with
discrete time. But it can be useful to have continuous time too. Processes can
emulate functions, expectation of profit functional on the solution of
stochastic differential equation can emulate the functional on usual familiar
functions. The advantage is that now we have ""all"" admissible functions
""enumerated"" as solutions of one stochastic differential equation, and choosing
the best function optimizing a given functional becomes a problem of choosing
the right control process. But such problem has been long since solved in the
part of mathematics called Stochastic Optimal Control. So-called Bellman
equation reduces an infinite dimensional problem of choosing the best control
to a finite dimensional (but non-linear as a rule) PDE called Bellman equation.
Its solution, called Bellman function of a given optimization problem, gives us
a lot of information about optimum and optimizers. This method gave some
interesting results in the classical Harmonic Analysis, having on the surface
nothing to do with probability. Sometimes the results obtained by this method
did not find ""classical"" proofs so far. It is especially well-suited to
estimates of singular integrals, probably because of the underlying
probabilistic structure of classical singular integrals.

the spectral data and search for changes in the average X-ray spectrum with
flux level. The aggregated X-ray spectra appear unlike standard sub-Eddington
accretion state spectra which, alongside the lack of discernible variability at
any energy, argues strongly against conventional two-component, sub-Eddington
models. Although the lack of variability could be consistent with
disc-dominated spectra, sub-Eddington disc models are not sufficiently broad to
explain the observed spectra. Fits with a ~ Eddington accretion rate slim disc
model are acceptable, but the fits show that the temperature decreases with
flux, contrary to expectations, and this is accompanied by the appearance of a
harder tail to the spectrum. Applying a suitable two-component model reveals
that the disc becomes cooler and less advection dominated as the X-ray flux
increases, and this is allied to the emergence of an optically-thick
Comptonisation medium. We present a scenario in which this is explained by the
onset of a radiatively-driven wind from the innermost regions of the accretion
disc, as M33 X-8 exceeds the Eddington limit. Furthermore, we argue that the
direct evolution of this spectrum with increasing luminosity (and hence
radiation pressure) leads naturally to the two-component spectra seen in more
luminous ULXs.

disrupt the dance? The most intriguing possibility is the formation of a
modulated superfluid state, known as an LO phase, in which the excess fermions
self-organize into domain walls where the pairing amplitude changes sign.
Despite fifty years of theoretical and experimental work, there has so far been
no direct observation of an LO phase. Here we propose an experiment in which
two fermion clouds, prepared with unequal population imbalances, are allowed to
expand and interfere. A zipper pattern in the interference fringes is
unequivocal evidence of LO physics. Furthermore, because the experiment is
resolved in time and in two spatial directions, we expect an observable
signature even at finite temperatures (when thermal fluctuations destroy
long-range LO order averaged over time).

the density autocorrelation decays exponentially in time, except at a special

encoded into a complex ""density"" that can be obtained via complex-coordinate

to include a large number of economic and financial variables, which has been
shown to lead to significant improvements for forecasting, for example, by the
dynamic factor models. A challenging issue is to determine which variables and
(their) lags are relevant, especially when there is a mixture of serial
correlation (temporal dynamics), high dimensional (spatial) dependence
structure and moderate sample size (relative to dimensionality and lags). To
this end, an \textit{integrated} solution that addresses these three challenges
simultaneously is appealing. We study the large vector auto regressions here
with three types of estimates. We treat each variable's own lags different from
other variables' lags, distinguish various lags over time, and is able to
select the variables and lags simultaneously. We first show the consequences of
using Lasso type estimate directly for time series without considering the
temporal dependence. In contrast, our proposed method can still produce an
estimate as efficient as an \textit{oracle} under such scenarios. The tuning
parameters are chosen via a data driven ""rolling scheme"" method to optimize the
forecasting performance. A macroeconomic and financial forecasting problem is
considered to illustrate its superiority over existing estimators.

${{\log J \, \cx^*(\ct)}}/{T} = \Co(1)$ (the former scheme with some time

with some upper bounded mixing coefficient). We quantify the interplay between
the estimators' consistency rate and the time dependence level, discuss an
intuitive resampling scheme for threshold selection, and also prove a general
cross-validation result justifying this. Given a consistently estimated
covariance (correlation) matrix, by utilizing its natural links with graphical
models and semiparametrics, after ""screening"" the (explanatory) variables, we
implement a novel forward (and backward) label permutation procedure to cluster
the ""relevant"" variables and construct the corresponding semiparametric model,

sign constraints. We call this the SCE (screen - cluster - estimate) approach

apply this method to study the spatial structure of large panels of economic

description of these collisions wherein the high energy nuclear wavefunctions

quantum fluctuations around the classical background fields. One class of these
contributes to the energy evolution of multi-parton correlators in the nuclear
wavefunctions. Another dominant class of unstable quantum fluctuations grow
rapidly with proper time $\tau$ after the collision. These secular terms appear
at each loop order; the leading contributions can be resummed to all loop
orders to obtain expressions for final state observables. The all-order result
can be expressed in terms of the spectrum of fluctuations on the initial proper
time surface. We compute, in $A^\tau=0$ gauge, the essential elements in this

since the discovery of optical afterglows. However, even after nearly 7 years
of operation of the Swift Observatory, only a handful of measurements have been
made soon (within a minute) after the gamma ray signal. This lack of early
observations fails to address burst physics at short time scales associated
with prompt emissions and progenitors. Because of this lack of sub-minute data,
the characteristics of the rise phase of optical light curve of short-hard type
GRB and rapid-rising GRB, which may account for ~30% of all GRB, remain
practically unknown. We have developed methods for reaching sub-minute and
sub-second timescales in a small spacecraft observatory. Rather than slewing
the entire spacecraft to aim the optical instrument at the GRB position, we use
rapidly moving mirror to redirect our optical beam. As a first step, we employ
motorized slewing mirror telescope (SMT), which can point to the event within
1s, in the UFFO Pathfinder GRB Telescope onboard the Lomonosov satellite to be
launched in Nov. 2011. UFFO's sub-minute measurements of the optical emission
of dozens of GRB each year will result in a more rigorous test of current
internal shock models, probe the extremes of bulk Lorentz factors, provide the
first early and detailed measurements of fast-rise GRB optical light curves,
and help verify the prospect of GRB as a new standard candle. We will describe

simultaneously present in the fine structure of solar prominences. We
investigate standing kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in flowing prominence
threads from a theoretical point of view. We model a prominence fine structure
as a cylindrical magnetic tube embedded in the solar corona with its ends
line-tied in the photosphere. The magnetic cylinder is composed of a region
with dense prominence plasma, which is flowing along the magnetic tube, whereas
the rest of the flux tube is occupied by coronal plasma. We use the WKB
approximation to obtain analytical expressions for the period and the amplitude
of the fundamental mode as functions of the flow velocity. In addition, we
solve the full problem numerically by means of time-dependent simulations. We
find that both the period and the amplitude of the standing MHD waves vary in
time as the prominence thread flows along the magnetic structure. The
fundamental kink mode is a good description for the time-dependent evolution of
the oscillations, and the analytical expressions in the WKB approximation are
in agreement with the full numerical results. The presence of flow modifies the
period of the oscillations with respect to the static case. However, for
realistic flow velocities this effect might fall within the error bars of the
observations. The variation of the amplitude due to the flow leads to apparent
damping or amplification of the oscillations, which could modify the real rate
of attenuation caused by an additional damping mechanism.

block of the standard model and beyond. Since Yang-Mills theories are gauge
theories their elementary particles, the gauge bosons, cannot be described
without fixing a gauge. Beyond perturbation theory, gauge-fixing in non-Abelian
gauge theories is obstructed by the Gribov-Singer ambiguity. The construction
and implementation of a method-independent gauge-fixing prescription to resolve
this ambiguity is the most important step to describe gauge bosons beyond
perturbation theory. Proposals for such a procedure, generalizing the
perturbative Landau gauge, are described here. Their implementation are
discussed for two example methods, lattice gauge theory and the quantum
equations of motion. The most direct access to the properties of the gauge
bosons is provided by their correlation functions. The corresponding two- and
three-point correlation functions are presented at all energy scales. These
give access to the properties of the gauge bosons, like their absence from the
asymptotic physical state space, the absence of an on-shell mass pole,
particle-like properties at high energies, and their running couplings.
Furthermore, auxiliary degrees of freedom are introduced during gauge-fixing,
and their properties are discussed as well. These results are presented for
two, three, and four dimensions, and for various gauge algebras. Finally, the
modifications of the properties of gauge bosons at finite temperature are
presented. Evidence is provided that these reflect the phase structure of
Yang-Mills theory. However, it is found that the phase transition is not
deconfining the gauge bosons, although the bulk thermodynamical behavior is of
a Stefan-Boltzmann type. The resolution of this apparent contradiction is also
presented. This resolution also provides an explicit and constructive solution
to the Linde problem.

practice, several authors have found that the no-slip boundary condition at the
walls of a vessel can slow down mixing considerably, turning an exponential
decay into a power law. This slowdown affects the whole mixing region, and not
just the vicinity of the wall. The reason is that when the chaotic mixing
region extends to the wall, a separatrix connects to it. The approach to the
wall along that separatrix is polynomial in time and dominates the long-time
decay. However, if the walls are moved or rotated, closed orbits appear,
separated from the central mixing region by a hyperbolic fixed point with a
homoclinic orbit. The long-time approach to the fixed point is exponential, so
an overall exponential decay is recovered, albeit with a thin unmixed region

mainly on alternating links. Various ways to compute the colored Jones
polynomial for a given link give rise to combinatorial identities for those
power series. We further show that the head and tail functions only depend on
the reduced checkerboard graphs of the knot diagram. Moreover the class of head
and tail functions of prime alternating links forms a monoid.

  Herbig Ae/Be binary systems","Accepted in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201116996",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The majority of the pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars reside in binary
systems. As these systems are young, their properties may contain an imprint of
the star formation process at intermediate masses. However, these systems are
generally spatially unresolved, making it difficult to probe their
circumstellar environment to search for manifestations of their formation
process, such as accretion disks. Here we investigate the formation mechanism
of Herbig Ae/Be (HAe/Be) binary systems by studying the relative orientation of
their binary orbits and circumstellar disks. We present linear
spectropolarimetric observations of HAe/Be stars over the Halpha line, which
are used to determine the orientation of their circumstellar disks. In
conjunction with data from the literature, we obtain a sample of 20 binaries
with known disk position angles (PAs). We compare our disk PA data to a model
to investigate whether HAe/Be binary systems and their disks are co-planar.
Moreover, in the light of a recent suggestion that some HAe/Be star
spectropolarimetric signatures may not necessarily be related to circumstellar
disks, we re-assess the relationship between spectropolarimetric signatures and
disk PAs. We do this by comparing spectropolarimetric and high spatial
resolution observations of young stellar objects. We find that
spectropolarimetric observations of pre-main-sequence stars do trace
circumstellar disks. This finding is significant above the 3 sigma level. Using
this result, our data are entirely consistent with the situation in which
HAe/Be binary systems and circumstellar disks are co-planar, while random
orientations can be rejected at the 2.2 sigma level. We conclude that HAe/Be
binary systems and the disks around the primaries are likely to be co-planar,
which is consistent with the notion that these systems form via monolithic
collapse and subsequent disk fragmentation (abridged).

Schwartz in 1992 for convex planar
polygons. Recently, V. Ovsienko, R. Schwartz, and S. Tabachnikov proved
Liouville integrability of the pentagram map for generic monodromies by
providing a Poisson structure and the sufficient number of integrals in
involution on the space of twisted polygons. In this paper we prove
algebraic-geometric integrability for any monodromy, i.e., for both twisted and
closed polygons. For that purpose we show that the pentagram map can be written
as a discrete zero-curvature equation with a spectral parameter, study the
corresponding spectral curve, and the dynamics on its Jacobian. We also prove
that on the symplectic leaves Poisson brackets discovered for twisted polygons
coincide with the symplectic structure obtained from Krichever-Phong's
universal formula.

consist of the evaluations of polynomials $f \in \F_q[X]$ of degree $< k$ at
$n$ distinct field elements. In this work, we consider a closely related family
of codes, called (order $m$) {\em derivative codes} and defined over fields of
large characteristic, which consist of the evaluations of $f$ as well as its
first $m-1$ formal derivatives at $n$ distinct field elements. For large enough
$m$, we show that these codes can be list-decoded in polynomial time from an
error fraction approaching $1-R$, where $R=k/(nm)$ is the rate of the code.
This gives an alternate construction to folded Reed-Solomon codes for achieving
the optimal trade-off between rate and list error-correction radius. Our
decoding algorithm is linear-algebraic, and involves solving a linear system to
interpolate a multivariate polynomial, and then solving another structured
linear system to retrieve the list of candidate polynomials $f$. The algorithm
for derivative codes offers some advantages compared to a similar one for
folded Reed-Solomon codes in terms of efficient unique decoding in the presence
of side information.
