equations on a Schwarzschild background space-time for a perfect fluid, where
the perfect fluid models the dark matter and the space-time background is that
of a non-rotating supermassive black hole. We consider the fluid obeys an ideal
gas equation of state as a simple model of dark matter with pressure. Assuming
out of equilibrium initial conditions we search for late-time attractor type of
solutions, which we found to show a constant accretion rate for the non-zero
pressure case, that is, the pressure itself suffices to produce stationary
accretion regimes. We then analyze the resulting density profile of such
late-time solutions with the function $A/r^{\kappa}$. For different values of
the adiabatic index we find different slopes of the density profile, and we
study such profile in two regions: a region one near the black hole, located
from the horizon up to 50$M$ and a region two from $\sim 800M$ up to $\sim
1500M$, which for a black hole of $10^{9}M_{\odot}$ corresponds to $\sim
0.1$pc. The profile depends on the adiabatic index or equivalently on the
pressure of the fluid and our findings are as follows: in the near region the
density profile shows values of $\kappa <1.5$ and in the limit of the
pressure-less case $\kappa \rightarrow 1.5$; on the other hand, in region two,
the value of $\kappa<0.3$ in all the cases we studied. If these results are to
be applied to the dark matter problem, the conclusion is that, in the limit of
pressure-less gas the density profile is cuspy only near the black hole and
approaches a non-cuspy profile at bigger scales within 1pc. These results show
on the one hand that pressure suffices to provide flat density profiles of dark
matter and on the other hand show that the presence of a central black hole
does not distort the density profile of dark matter at scales of 0.1pc.

submitted to an imposed deformation. By varying the amount of loop chains
between each phase, i.e. noncrossing chains, it is possible to generate
different types of S/B interface definitions. A specific boundary driven
tensile strain protocol has been developed in order to mimic ""real"" experiments

reference state consisting in a directed glassy homopolymers, as well as to an
isotropic glassy polymer. The evolution of initial mutual entanglements from
the undeformed samples during the whole deformation process is monitored. It is
shown for all considered systems that initial entanglements mostly participate
to the preyield regime of the stress-strain curve and that this network is
debonded during the strain-hardening regime. For triblocks with a non-null
amount of crossing chains, the lower the amount is, the longer the memory
effect of the initial entanglement network in the postyield regime is. On the

important to understand the structure and evolution of

planet/satellite formation. The turbulence that causes gas accretion is
supposed to be driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI) that occurs only
when the ionization degree is high enough for magnetic field to be coupled to
gas. We calculate the ionization degrees in circumplanetary disks to estimate
the sizes of MRI-inactive regions. We properly include the effect of dust
grains because they efficiently capture charged particles and make ionization
degree lower. Inclusion of dust grains complicates the reaction equations and
requires expensive computation. In order to accelerate the calculation of
ionization reactions, we develop a semianalytic method based on the charge
distribution model proposed previously. This method enables us to study the
ionization state of disks for a wide range of model parameters. For a previous
model of circum-Jovian disk, we find that an MRI-inactive region covers almost
all regions even without dust grains. This suggests that the gas accretion
rates in circumplanetary disks are much smaller than previously thought.

describe the prions of yeast and other fungi. Prions are infectious proteins
behaving like genes, i.e. proteins that not only contain genetic information in
its tertiary structure, i.e. its shape, but are also able to transmit and
replicate in a manner analogous to genes but through very different mechanisms.
The term prion is derived from ""proteinaceous infectious particle"" and arose
from the Prusiner hypothesis that the infectious agent of certain
neurodegenerative diseases was only in a protein, without the participation of
nucleic acids. Currently there are several known types of prion, in addition to
the originally described, which are pathogens of mammals, yeast and other
fungi. Prion proteins are ubiquitous and not always detrimental to their hosts.
This vision of the prion as a causative agent of disease is changing, finding
more and more evidence that they could have important roles in cells and

promise of low cost, roll-to-roll manufacturability, and mechanical
flexibility. However, deployment is impeded by their relatively low power
conversion efficiencies. The last decade has seen significant progress in
enhancing the power conversion of these devices through various strategies. One
such approach is based on morphology control. This is because morphology
affects all phenomena involved in solar conversion: light absorption and
electron-hole pair (exciton) generation; exciton diffusion and dissociation
into free charges; and transport of charges to the electrodes. Progress in
experimental characterization and computational modeling now allow
reconstruction and imaging of the thin film morphology. This opens up the
possibility of rationally linking fabrication with morphology, as well as
morphology with performance. In this context, a comprehensive set of
computational tools to rapidly quantify and classify the heterogeneous internal
structure of thin films will be invaluable in linking process, structure and
property. We present a novel graph-based framework to efficiently construct a
broad suite of physically meaningful morphology descriptors. These morphology
descriptors are further classified according to the physical subprocesses
within an organic solar cells. The approach is motivated by the equivalence
between a discretized morphology and a labeled, weighted, undirected graph. We
utilize this approach to pose key questions related to structure
characterization. We subsequently construct estimates and upper bounds of
various efficiencies. The approach is showcased by characterizing the effect of
thermal annealing on time-evolution of a thin film morphology. We conclude by
formulating natural extensions to characterize crystallinity and anisotropy of
the morphology using the framework.

with maximum angular-momentum projection along the quantization axis possesses
orientation and is a quantum-mechanical minimum-uncertainty state, where the
product of the equal uncertainties of the angular-momentum projections on two
orthogonal directions transverse to the quantization axis is the minimum
allowed by the uncertainty relation. Application of an electric field for a
short time induces orientation-to-alignment conversion and produces a
spin-squeezed state, in which the quantum state essentially remains a
minimum-uncertainty state, but the uncertainties of the angular-momentum
projections on the orthogonal directions are unequal. This property can be
visualized using the angular-momentum probability surfaces, where the radius of

sizable initial pressure anisotropy, which may leave an imprint on
electromagnetic observables. In order to model a strongly coupled anisotropic
plasma, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate the current-current
correlator of a weakly gauged U(1) subgroup of R symmetry in an N=4
super-Yang-Mills plasma with a (temporarily) fixed anisotropy. The dual
geometry, obtained previously by Janik and Witaszczyk, contains a naked
singularity which however permits purely infalling boundary conditions and
therefore the usual definition of a retarded correlator. We obtain numerical
results for the cases of wave vector parallel and orthogonal to the direction
of anisotropy, and we compare with previous isotropic results. In the
(unphysical) limit of vanishing frequency (infinite time) we obtain a vanishing
DC conductivity for any amount of anisotropy, but the anisotropic AC
conductivities smoothly approach the isotropic case in the limit of high
frequencies. We also discuss hard photon production from an anisotropic plasma
and compare with existing hard-loop resummed calculations.

rapidly confirmed it to be a Type II supernova. Our early light curve and
spectroscopy indicates that PTF11eon resulted from the explosion of a
relatively compact progenitor star as evidenced by the rapid shock-breakout
cooling seen in the light curve, the relatively low temperature in early-time
spectra and the prompt appearance of low-ionization spectral features. The
spectra of PTF11eon are dominated by H lines out to day 10 after explosion, but
initial signs of He appear to be present. Assuming that He lines continue to
develop in the near future, this SN is likely a member of the cIIb (compact
IIb; Chevalier and Soderberg 2010) class, with progenitor radius larger than
that of SN 2008ax and smaller than the eIIb (extended IIb) SN 1993J progenitor.
Our data imply that the object identified in pre-explosion Hubble Space
Telescope images at the SN location is possibly a companion to the progenitor
or a blended source, and not the progenitor star itself, as its radius (~10^13
cm) would be highly inconsistent with constraints from our post-explosion
photometric and spectroscopic data.

multiple interactions; we contrast this situation with that needed for a

interactions can be finite, as a result of gravitational red shift. We outline
an illustrative construction of arbitrary normalizable wavepackets from
boundary data, that also yields such spurious interactions. Another set of
non-trivial questions regard the form of unitarity relations for the bulk
S-matrix, and in particular its normalization and multi-particle cuts. These
combined constraints, together with those found earlier on boundary singularity

novel phase transitions, in some of which the gauge group remains fixed but the

identified through anomaly cancellation and other consistency conditions.
Analogous 4D models are constructed through global F-theory compactifications

Andromeda galaxy, M31, and have decomposed it into three basic luminous
structural components: a bulge, a disk and a halo. The dust-free Spitzer/IRAC
imaging and extended spatial coverage of ground-based optical imaging and deep
star counts allow us to map M31's structure from its center to 22 kpc along the
major axis. We apply different decomposition methods for the 1D luminosity
profiles and 2D images. These include non-linear least-squares and Bayesian
Monte-Carlo Markov-chain analyses. The basic photometric model for M31 has a
Sersic bulge with shape index n = 2.2 +/- 0.3 and effective radius R_e = 1.0
+/- 0.2 kpc, a dust-free exponential disk of scale length R_d = 5.3 +/- 0.5
kpc; the parameter errors reflect the range between various decomposition
methods. The bulge parameter, n, is rather insensitive to bandpass effects and
its value suggests a first rapid formation via mergers followed by secular
growth from the disk. The M31 halo has a 2D power-law index ~ -2.5 +/- 0.2. We
find that the M31 bulge light is mostly dominant over the range R_minor < 1.2
kpc. The disk takes over in the range 1.2 kpc < R_minor < 9 kpc, whereas the
halo dominates at R_minor > 9 kpc. The stellar nucleus, bulge, disk, and halo
components each contribute roughly 0.05%, 23%, 73% and 4% of the total light of
M31 out to 200 kpc along the minor axis. Nominal errors for the structural
parameters of the M31 bulge, disk and halo amount to 20%. If M31 and the Milky
Way are at all typical, faint stellar halos should be routinely detected in
galaxy surveys reaching below mu_i ~ 27 mag/arcsec^2. We stress that our
results rely on this photometric analysis alone. Structural parameters may
change when other fundamental constraints, such as those provided by abundance
gradients and stellar kinematics, are considered simultaneously (Abridged).

data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the active galactic nucleus
(AGN) luminosity using the [O IV] 25.89 micron emission line and the
star-forming luminosity using the 11.3 micron aromatic feature and extended 24
micron continuum emission. We find that black hole growth is strongly
correlated with nuclear (r<1 kpc) star formation, but only weakly correlated
with extended (r>1 kpc) star formation in the host galaxy. In particular, the
nuclear star-formation rate (SFR) traced by the 11.3 micron aromatic feature
follows a relationship with the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) of the form
SFR\proptoBHAR^0.8, with an observed scatter of 0.5 dex. This SFR-BHAR
relationship persists when additional star formation in physically matched r=1
kpc apertures is included, taking the form SFR\proptoBHAR^0.6. However, the
relationship becomes almost indiscernible when total SFRs are considered. This
suggests a physical connection between the gas on sub-kpc and sub-pc scales in
local Seyfert galaxies that is not related to external processes in the host
galaxy. It also suggests that the observed scaling between star formation and
black hole growth for samples of AGNs will depend on whether the star formation
is dominated by a nuclear or extended component. We estimate the integrated
black hole and bulge growth that occurs in these galaxies and find that an AGN
duty cycle of 5-10% would maintain the ratio between black hole and bulge
masses seen in the local universe.

than one million yr that preclude observations at birth. Transient accretion
onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of a
stray star, may therefore offer a unique opportunity to observe and study the
birth of a relativistic jet. On 2011 March 25, the Swift {\gamma}-ray satellite
discovered an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) potentially
representing such an event. Here we present the discovery of a luminous radio
transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451, and an extensive set of
observations spanning centimeter to millimeter wavelengths and covering the
first month of evolution. These observations lead to a positional coincidence
with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy, and provide direct evidence for a
newly-formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a
million solar mass black hole. While a relativistic outflow was not predicted
in this scenario, we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally
explains the high-energy properties, radio luminosity, and the inferred rate of
such events. The weaker beaming in the radio compared to {\gamma}-rays/X-rays,
suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z ~

broader PTF survey, a systematic automated exploration of the sky for optical
transients. Taking advantage of the wide field of view available using the PTF
camera at the Palomar 48"" telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in December
2009-January 2010 to perform continuous high-cadence differential photometry on
a single field containing the young (7-10Myr) 25 Ori association. The primary
motivation for the project is to search for planets around young stars in this
region. The unique data set also provides for much ancillary science. In this
first paper we describe the survey and data reduction pipeline, and present
initial results from an inspection of the most clearly varying stars relating
to two of the ancillary science objectives: detection of eclipsing binaries and
young stellar objects. We find 82 new eclipsing binary systems, 9 of which we
are candidate 25 Ori- or Orion OB1a-association members. Of these, 2 are
potential young W UMa type systems. We report on the possible low-mass (M-dwarf
primary) eclipsing systems in the sample, which include 6 of the candidate
young systems. 45 of the binary systems are close (mainly contact) systems; one
shows an orbital period among the shortest known for W UMa binaries, at
0.2156509 \pm 0.0000071d, with flat-bottomed primary eclipses, and a derived
distance consistent with membership in the general Orion association. One of
the candidate young systems presents an unusual light curve, perhaps
representing a semi-detached binary system with an inflated low-mass primary or
a star with a warped disk, and may represent an additional young Orion member.
Finally, we identify 14 probable new classical T-Tauri stars in our data, along
with one previously known (CVSO 35) and one previously reported as a candidate
weak-line T-Tauri star (SDSS J052700.12+010136.8).

released through magnetic reconnection for a flare on 26 Feb 2004. This flare,
well observed by RHESSI and TRACE, shows evidence of non-thermal electrons only
for a brief, early phase. Throughout the main period of energy release there is
a super-hot (T>30 MK) plasma emitting thermal bremsstrahlung atop the flare
loops. Our model describes the heating and compression of such a source by
localized, transient magnetic reconnection. It is a three-dimensional
generalization of the Petschek model whereby Alfven-speed retraction following
reconnection drives supersonic inflows parallel to the field lines, which form
shocks heating, compressing, and confining a loop-top plasma plug. The
confining inflows provide longer life than a freely-expanding or
conductively-cooling plasma of similar size and temperature. Superposition of
successive transient episodes of localized reconnection across a current sheet
produces an apparently persistent, localized source of high-temperature
emission. The temperature of the source decreases smoothly on a time scale
consistent with observations, far longer than the cooling time of a single
plug. Built from a disordered collection of small plugs, the source need not
have the coherent jet-like structure predicted by steady-state reconnection
models. This new model predicts temperatures and emission measure consistent
with the observations of 26 Feb 2004. Furthermore, the total energy released by
the flare is found to be roughly consistent with that predicted by the model.
Only a small fraction of the energy released appears in the super-hot source at
any one time, but roughly a quarter of the flare energy is thermalized by the
reconnection shocks over the course of the flare. All energy is presumed to
ultimately appear in the lower-temperature T<20 MK, post-flare loops.

us to construct an ergodic equilibrium state with a weak Gibbs property, which

using these approaches. In particular, we consider $\beta$-shifts and show that

exhibits a dramatic increase in viscosity. Structurally, the system resembles a
liquid, yet motions within the suspension are slow enough that it can be
considered essentially frozen. This kinetic arrest is the colloidal glass
transition. For several decades, colloids have served as a valuable model
system for understanding the glass transition in molecular systems. The spatial
and temporal scales involved allow these systems to be studied by a wide
variety of experimental techniques. The focus of this review is the current
state of understanding of the colloidal glass transition. A brief introduction
is given to important experimental techniques used to study the glass
transition in colloids. We describe features of colloidal systems near and in
glassy states, including tremendous increases in viscosity and relaxation
times, dynamical heterogeneity, and ageing, among others. We also compare and
contrast the glass transition in colloids to that in molecular liquids. Other
glassy systems are briefly discussed, as well as recently developed synthesis
techniques that will keep these systems rich with interesting physics for years
to come.

matrix arise from 1-loop self-energy diagrams mediated by a heavy neutrino. We
study in detail these corrections and demonstrate that they can be very
significant, exceeding in several cases the tree-level result. We consider the
normal and inverted hierarchy spectra for light neutrinos and compute the
finite corrections to the different elements of the neutrino mass matrix.
Special attention is paid to their dependence with the parameters of the seesaw
model. Among the cases in which the corrections can be large, we identify the
fine-tuned models considered previously in the literature, where a strong
cancellation between the different parameters is required to achieve
compatibility with the experimental data. As a particular example, we also
analyze how these corrections modify the tribimaximal mixing pattern and find
that the deviations may be sizable, in particular for $\theta_{13}$. Finally,
we emphasize that due to their large size, the finite corrections to neutrino
masses have to be taken into account if one wants to properly scan the

explanation of the magic of creativity. Creativity presents a formidable
challenge for neuroscience. Neuroscience generally involves studying what
happens in the brain when someone engages in a task that involves responding to
a stimulus, or retrieving information from memory and using it the right way,
or at the right time. If the relevant information is not already encoded in
memory, the task generally requires that the individual make systematic use of
information that is encoded in memory. But creativity is different. It
paradoxically involves studying how someone pulls out of their brain something
that was never put into it! Moreover, it must be something both new and useful,
or appropriate to the task at hand. The ability to pull out of memory something
new and appropriate that was never stored there in the first place is what we
refer to as the magic of creativity. Even if we are so fortunate as to
determine which areas of the brain are active and how these areas interact
during creative thought, we will not have an answer to the question of how the
brain comes up with solutions and artworks that are new and appropriate. On the
other hand, since the representational capacity of neurons emerges at a level
that is higher than that of the individual neurons themselves, the inner
workings of neurons is too low a level to explain the magic of creativity. Thus
we look to a level that is midway between gross brain regions and neurons.
Since creativity generally involves combining concepts from different domains,
or seeing old ideas from new perspectives, we focus our efforts on the neural
mechanisms underlying the representation of concepts and ideas. Thus we ask
questions about the brain at the level that accounts for its representational
capacity, i.e. at the level of distributed aggregates of neurons.

has been made in the J=2-1 and J=1-0 transitions of 12CO and 13CO. M20 is
ionized predominantly by an O7.5 star HD164492. The study has revealed that
there are two molecular components at separate velocities peaked toward the
center of M20 and that their temperatures - 30-50 K as derived by an LVG
analysis - are significantly higher than the 10 K of their surroundings. We
identify that the two clouds as the parent clouds of the first generation stars
in M20. The mass of each cloud is estimated to be ~10^3 Msun and their
separation velocity is ~8 km/s over ~1-2 pc. We find the total mass of stars
and molecular gas in M20 is less than ~3.2 \times 103 Msun, which is too small
by an order of magnitude to gravitationally bind the system. We argue that the
formation of the first generation stars, including the main ionizing O7.5 s
tar, was triggered by the collision between the two clouds in a short time
scale of ~1 Myrs, a second example alongside Westerlund 2, where a super star
cluster may have been formed due to cloud-cloud collision triggering.

50-70% of the uranium in a deposit could be mined. An analysis of more recent
data from Canada and Australia leads to a mining model with an average deposit
extraction lifetime of 10+- 2 years. This simple model provides an accurate
description of the extractable amount of uranium for the recent mining
operations.
  Using this model for all larger existing and planned uranium mines up to
2030, a global uranium mining peak of at most 58 +- 4 ktons around the year
2015 is obtained. Thereafter we predict that uranium mine production will
decline to at most 54 +- 5 ktons by 2025 and, with the decline steepening, to
at most 41 +- 5 ktons around 2030. This amount will not be sufficient to fuel
the existing and planned nuclear power plants during the next 10-20 years. In
fact, we find that it will be difficult to avoid supply shortages even under a
slow 1%/year worldwide nuclear energy phase-out scenario up to 2025. We thus
suggest that a worldwide nuclear energy phase-out is in order.
  If such a slow global phase-out is not voluntarily effected, the end of the
present cheap uranium supply situation will be unavoidable. The result will be
that some countries will simply be unable to afford sufficient uranium fuel at
that point, which implies involuntary and perhaps chaotic nuclear phase-outs in
those countries involving brownouts, blackouts, and worse.

magnetar magnetosphere, a generalized magnetic virial theorem in the
Schwarzschild metric is newly derived. We carefully address the question
whether the magnetar magnetospheric magnetic field can build up sufficient
magnetic energy to account for the work required to open up the magnetic field
during magnetar giant flares. We point out the importance of the Aly-Sturrock
constraint, which has been widely studied in solar corona mass ejections, as a
reference state in understanding magnetar energy storage processes. We examine
how the magnetic field can possess enough energy to overcome the Aly-Sturrock
energy constraint and open up. In particular, general relativistic (GR) effects
on the Aly-Sturrock energy constraint in the Schwarzschild spacetime are
carefully investigated. It is found that, for magnetar outbursts, the
Aly-Sturrock constraint is more stringent, i.e., the Aly-Sturrock energy
threshold is enhanced due to the GR effects. In addition, neutron stars with
greater mass have a higher Aly-Sturrock energy threshold and are more difficult
to erupt. This indicates that magnetars are probably not neutron stars with
extreme mass. For a typical neutron star with mass of $1-2 M_{\odot}$, we
further explore the effects of cross-field current effects, caused by the mass
loading, on the possibility of stored magnetic field energy exceeding the
Aly-Sturrock threshold.

vertex-connectivity of visibility graphs.
  Unless all its vertices are collinear, a visibility graph has diameter at
most 2, and so it follows by a result of Plesn\'ik (1975) that its
edge-connectivity equals its minimum degree. We strengthen the result of
Plesn\'ik by showing that for any two vertices v and w in a graph of diameter
2, if deg(v) <= deg(w) then there exist deg(v) edge-disjoint vw-paths of length
at most 4. Furthermore, we find that in visibility graphs every minimum edge
cut is the set of edges incident to a vertex of minimum degree.
  For vertex-connectivity, we prove that every visibility graph with n vertices
and at most l collinear vertices has connectivity at least (n-1)/(l-1), which
is tight. We also prove the qualitatively stronger result that the
vertex-connectivity is at least half the minimum degree. Finally, in the case

the dynamical and structural properties of colloidal and granular matter in
real space. Localization algorithms allow for a fully automatized determination
of the three dimensional positions and translational motions of all constituent
(spherical) particles in the observed volume. Though, particle deformations or
rotational motions were hardly addressed. Here we present preparation and image
processing techniques to also extract the deformation and rotational state of
the particles. The deformation analysis is worked out for particles with a
hollow sphere-like fluorescence intensity distribution that are more sensitive
to small deformations. In the second case of rotations we utilize the angle
dependence of the light absorption of the incorporated dye molecules to prepare
optically anisotropic particles in analogy to polarized fluorescence after
photobleaching. Rotations of these particles are expressed as intensity
fluctuations in the confocal images. In contrast to existing methods our
techniques do not reduce the quality of the actual particle localization. They
can help understanding complex reorganization processes in arrested states of
colloidal and granular materials during aging or under external stimuli such as
shear or compression.

locality r, if the value at this coordinate can be recovered from accessing
some other r coordinates of C. Data storage applications require codes with
small redundancy, low locality for information coordinates, large distance, and
low locality for parity coordinates. In this paper we carry out an in-depth
study of the relations between these parameters.
  We establish a tight bound for the redundancy n-k in terms of the message
length, the distance, and the locality of information coordinates. We refer to
codes attaining the bound as optimal. We prove some structure theorems about
optimal codes, which are particularly strong for small distances. This gives a
fairly complete picture of the tradeoffs between codewords length, worst-case
distance and locality of information symbols.
  We then consider the locality of parity check symbols and erasure correction
beyond worst case distance for optimal codes. Using our structure theorem, we
obtain a tight bound for the locality of parity symbols possible in such codes
for a broad class of parameter settings. We prove that there is a tradeoff
between having good locality for parity checks and the ability to correct
erasures beyond the minimum distance.

network coding (ANC) in a layered relay network for the high-SNR regime. They
have proved that under the ANC scheme, if each relay transmits the received
signals at the upper bound of the power constraint, the transmission rate will
approach the network capacity. In this paper, we consider a more general
scenario defined as the generalized high-SNR regime, where the relays at layer
$l$ in a layered relay network with $L$ layers do not satisfy the high-SNR
conditions, and then determine an ANC relay scheme in such network. By relating
the received SNR at the nodes with the propagated noise, we derive the rate
achievable by the ANC scheme proposed in this paper. The result shows that the
achievable ANC rate approaches the upper bound of the ANC capacity as the
received powers at relays in high SNR increase. A comparison of the two ANC
schemes implies that the scheme proposed in [4] may not always be the optimal
one in the generalized high-SNR regime. The result also demonstrates that the
upper and lower bounds of the ANC rate coincide in the limit as the number of
relays at layer L-1 dissatisfying the high-SNR conditions tends to infinity,
yielding an asymptotic capacity result.

  (Conceptual Design Report)",,,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an EASY (Electroluminescent ApparatuS of high Yield) and SOFT
(Separated Optimized FuncTion) time-projection chamber for the NEXT experiment,
that will search for neutrinoless double beta decay (bb0nu) in Xe-136. Our
experiment must be competitive with the new generation of bb0nu searches
already in operation or in construction. This requires a detector with very
good energy resolution (<1%), very low background con- tamination (1E-4
counts/(keV \bullet kg \bullet y)) and large target mass. In addition, it needs
to be operational as soon as possible. The design described here optimizes
energy resolution thanks to the use of proportional electroluminescent
amplification (EL); it is compact, as the Xe gas is under high pressure; and it
allows the measurement of the topological signature of the event to further
reduce the background contamination. The SOFT design uses different sensors for
tracking and calorimetry. We propose the use of SiPMs (MPPCs) coated with a
suitable wavelength shifter for the tracking, and the use of radiopure
photomultipliers for the measurement of the energy and the primary
scintillation needed to estimate the t0. This design provides the best possible
energy resolution compared with other NEXT designs based on avalanche gain
devices. The baseline design is an Asymmetric Neutrino Gas EL apparatus
(ANGEL), which was already outlined in the NEXT LOI. ANGEL is conceived to be
easy to fabricate. It requires very little R&D and most of the proposed
solutions have already been tested in the NEXT-1 prototypes. Therefore, the
detector can be ready by 2013. In this Conceptual Design Report (CDR) we
discuss first the physics case, present a full design of the detector, describe
the NEXT-1 EL prototypes and their initial results, and outline a project to
build a detector with 100 kg of enriched xenon to be installed in the Canfranc

The
nanowires have a cross section as small as 50 nm^2. We focus on the retapping
current in a down-sweep of the current, at which a nanowire re-enters the
superconducting state from a normal state. The retrapping current is found to
be significantly smaller than the switching current at which the nanowire
switches into the normal state from a superconducting state during a current
up-sweep. For wires of different lengths, we analyze the heat removal due to
various processes, including electronic and phonon processes. For a short wires
1.5 um in length, electronic thermal conduction is effective; for longer wires
10um in length, phonon conduction becomes important. We demonstrate that the
measured retrapping current as a function of temperature can be quantitatively
accounted for by the selfheating occurring in the normal portions of the
nanowires to better than 20 % accuracy. For the phonon processes, the extracted
thermal conduction parameters support the notion of a reduced phase-space below
3-dimensions, consistent with the phonon thermal wavelength having exceeded the
lateral dimensions at temperatures below ~ 1.3K. Nevertheless, surprisingly the
best fit was achieved with a functional form corresponding to 3-dimensional
phonons, albeit requiring parameters far exceeding known values in the
literature.

part of the large MESS (Mass loss of Evolved StarS) Guaranteed Time Key
Program. The images reveal an axisymmetric extended structure with its axis
oriented along the space motion of the stars. This extended structure is very
likely to be shaped by the interaction of the wind ejected by the AGB star with
the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). As predicted by numerical
simulations, the detailed structure of the wind-ISM interface depends upon the
relative velocity between star+wind and the ISM, which is large for these two
stars (108 and 55 km/s for X Her and TX Psc, respectively). In both cases,
there is a compact blob upstream whose origin is not fully elucidated, but that
could be the signature of some instability in the wind-ISM shock. Deconvolved
images of X Her and TX Psc reveal several discrete structures along the
outermost filaments, which could be Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. Finally, TX Psc
is surrounded by an almost circular ring (the signature of the termination
shock?) that contrasts with the outer, more structured filaments. A similar
inner circular structure seems to be present in X Her as well, albeit less
clearly.

such an enhancement is due to the disappearance of the nuclear shadowing effect

centrality dependencies of the directed, elliptic and triangular flows at
midrapidity shows us their sensitivity to the details of the employed model of
hadronic interaction. In general, the flow patters found for asymmetric nuclear
