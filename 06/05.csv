Such machine-type communication devices as meters and sensors need intermittent

activities may consider simple random access as a solution. The data collectors
receiving the measured data from many sensors simultaneously can successfully
decode only signals with signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) above a

space-time should exhibit a larger gain in regularity when compared to the
usual gain of half a derivative. By a result of Ivanovici, these refined local
smoothing estimates are satisfied by solutions in the exterior of a ball. We
show that when such estimates are valid, they can be combined with wave packet
parametrix constructions to yield Strichartz estimates. This provides an avenue
for obtaining these bounds when Neumann boundary conditions are imposed.

and groups of neurons is under intense investigation throughout the nervous
system. A ubiquitous circuit feature that can give rise to such correlations
consists of overlapping, or common, inputs to pairs and populations of cells,
leading to common spike train responses. Here, we use computational tools to
study how the transfer of common input currents into common spike outputs is
modulated by the physiology of the recipient cells. We focus on a key
conductance - gA, for the A-type potassium current - which drives neurons
between ""Type II"" excitability (low gA), and ""Type I"" excitability (high gA).
Regardless of gA, cells transform common input fluctuations into a ten- dency
to spike nearly simultaneously. However, this process is more pronounced at low
gA values, as previously predicted by reduced ""phase"" models. Thus, for a given
level of common input, Type II neurons produce spikes that are relatively more
correlated over short time scales. Over long time scales, the trend reverses,
with Type II neurons producing relatively less correlated spike trains. This is
because these cells' increased tendency for simultaneous spiking is balanced by
opposing tendencies at larger time lags. We demonstrate a novel implication for
neural signal processing: downstream cells with long time constants are
selectively driven by Type I cell populations upstream, and those with short
time constants by Type II cell populations. Our results are established via
high-throughput numerical simulations, and explained via the cells' filtering
properties and nonlinear dynamics.

superfluids, causing a momentum exchange between the two condensates, when the
relative velocity of the counterflow exceeds a critical value. The momentum
exchange leads to nucleation of vortex rings from characteristic density
patterns due to the nonlinear development of the instability. Expansion of the
vortex rings drastically accelerates the momentum exchange, leading to a highly
nonlinear regime caused by intervortex interaction and vortex reconnection
between the rings. For a sufficiently large interaction between the two

the global relative motion of the two condensates relaxes. The maximum vortex
line density in the turbulence is proportional to the square of the relative

rather counterintuitive. We study the anisotropic properties of the system by
examining the angular dependence of the number density distribution, the
excitation spectrum and the pair correlation function. The competing effects of
the contact interaction and the dipolar interaction upon the anisotropy are
revealed. We derive and compute the superfluid mass density $\rho_{ij}$ for the

certain temperature $T^*$($T<T_c$), signaling some instability of the system.
This suggests that the elusive FFLO state may be observed in experiments, due

anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model with staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interaction by means of quantum renormalization group method. The scaling of
coupling constants and the critical points of the system are obtained. It is
found that when the number of renormalization group iterations tends to
infinity, the system exhibit a QPT between the spin-fluid and N\'eel phases
which corresponds with two saturated values of the concurrence for a given
value of the strength of DM interaction. The DM interaction can enhance the
entanglement and influence the QPT of the system. To gain further insight, the
first derivative of the entanglement exhibit a nonanalytic behavior at the
critical point and it directly associates with the divergence of the
correlation length. This shows that the correlation length exponent is closely
related to the critical exponent, i.e., the scaling behaviors of the system.

with the CMS detector. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 36 inverse picobarns and is based on the
reconstruction of the final state with one isolated, high transverse-momentum
electron or muon and three or more hadronic jets. The kinematic properties of
the events are used to separate the top-antitop signal from W+jets and QCD
multijet background events. The measured cross section is 173 + 39 - 32 (stat.

in optical lattices is the ability to cool fermions. We determine the equation
of state for the 3D repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model as a function of the chemical
potential, temperature and repulsion using unbiased determinantal quantum Monte
Carlo methods, and we then use the local density approximation to model a
harmonic trap. We show that increasing repulsion leads to cooling, but only in
a trap, due to the redistribution of entropy from the center to the metallic
wings. Thus, even when the average entropy per particle is larger than that
required for antiferromagnetism in the homogeneous system, the trap enables the
formation of an AF Mott phase.

version of the ABJM model, we come with a solution in the Euclidean signature
recognized as a monopole instanton-like object. Indeed we will see that we can
have a (anti) self-dual solution at a special limit. While as a topological
object, its back-reaction on the original background should be ignorable, we
show the energy-momentum tensors vanish exactly. On the field theory side, the
best counterpart is an U(1) gauge field of a gauge transformation. To adjust
with bulk, the gauge field must prompt to a dynamic one without adding any
kinetic term for this dual photon except a marginal, abelian AB-type
Chern-Simons term on the boundary. We will see how both side solutions match
next to another confirmation from some earlier works of this vortex-particle
duality.
