features like modularity (and thus the possibility of being used in many
different biological contexts), simplicity, being based on a single cell, high
sensitivity and fast response. To uncover the critical model parameters and the
corresponding parameter domain at which the calibrator performance will be
optimal, a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was carried out over a
given range of sensing protein concentrations (acting as input). Our analysis
suggests that the half saturation constants for repression, sensing and
difference in binding cooperativity (Hill coefficients) for repression are the
key to the performance of the proposed device. They furthermore are determinant
for the sensing speed of the device, showing that it is possible to produce
detectable differences in the repression protein concentrations and in turn in
the corresponding fluorescence in less than two hours. This analysis paves the
way for the design, experimental construction and validation of a new family of
functional genetic circuits for the purpose of calibrating promoters.

combined with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique to marginalise over the
unknown parameters. Given sufficiently good data, we show that our method can
recover the correct local dark matter density even in the face of disc

function. We illustrate the power of our technique by applying it to Hipparcos

F star tracer populations are isothermal. This recovers
rho_dm=0.003^{+0.009}_{-0.007}Msun/pc^3 (with 90 per cent confidence),
consistent with previous determinations. However, the vertical dispersion
profile of these tracers is poorly known. If we assume instead a non-isothermal
profile similar to the blue disc stars from SDSS DR-7 [Abazajian et al. 2009]

(SNR) by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS provided new fundamental pieces of information
for understanding particle acceleration and non-thermal emission in SNRs. We
want to outline a coherent description of Tycho's properties in terms of SNR
evolution, shock hydrodynamics and multi-wavelength emission by accounting for
particle acceleration at the forward shock via first order Fermi mechanism. We
adopt here a quick and reliable semi-analytical approach to non-linear
diffusive shock acceleration which includes magnetic field amplification due to
resonant streaming instability and the dynamical backreaction on the shock of
both cosmic rays (CRs) and self-generated magnetic turbulence. We find that
Tycho's forward shock is accelerating protons up to at least 500 TeV,
channelling into CRs about the 10 per cent of its kinetic energy. Moreover, the
CR-induced streaming instability is consistent with all the observational
evidences indicating a very efficient magnetic field amplification (up to ~300
micro Gauss). In such a strong magnetic field the velocity of the Alfv\'en
waves scattering CRs in the upstream is expected to be enhanced and to make
accelerated particles feel an effective compression factor lower than 4, in
turn leading to an energy spectrum steeper than the standard prediction
{\propto} E^-2. This latter effect is crucial to explain the GeV-to-TeV
gamma-ray spectrum as due to the decay of neutral pions produced in nuclear
collisions between accelerated nuclei and the background gas. The
self-consistency of such an hadronic scenario, along with the fact that the
concurrent leptonic mechanism cannot reproduce both the shape and the
normalization of the detected the gamma-ray emission, represents the first
clear and direct radiative evidence that hadron acceleration occurs efficiently

with special emphasis on the mutual interaction between flow (large-scale
inhomogeneous structure) and turbulence. In order to evaluate the effective
transport due to turbulence, in addition to the {\it intensity} information of
turbulence represented by the turbulent energy, the {\it structure} information
represented by pseudoscalar statistical quantities (helicities) is important.
On the basis of the evolution equation, mechanisms that provide turbulence with
cross helicity are presented. Magnetic-flux freezing in highly turbulent media
is considered with special emphasis on the spatial distribution of the
turbulent cross helicity. The cross-helicity effects in the context of magnetic
reconnection are also investigated. It is shown that the large-scale flow and
magnetic-field configurations favorable for the cross-helicity generation is
compatible with the fast reconnection. In this sense, turbulence and
large-scale structures promote magnetic reconnection mediated by the turbulent
cross helicity.

physical models. In this paper we study the problem of estimating the
parameters that describe star formation history (SFH) in galaxies. Here,
high-dimensional spectral data from galaxies are appropriately modeled as
linear combinations of physical components, called simple stellar populations
(SSPs), plus some nonlinear distortions. Theoretical data for each SSP is
produced for a fixed parameter vector via computer modeling. Though the
parameters that define each SSP are continuous, optimizing the signal model
over a large set of SSPs on a fine parameter grid is computationally infeasible
and inefficient. The goal of this study is to estimate the set of parameters
that describes the SFH of each galaxy. These target parameters, such as the
average ages and chemical compositions of the galaxy's stellar populations, are
derived from the SSP parameters and the component weights in the signal model.
Here, we introduce a principled approach of choosing a small basis of SSP
prototypes for SFH parameter estimation. The basic idea is to quantize the
vector space and effective support of the model components. In addition to
greater computational efficiency, we achieve better estimates of the SFH target
parameters. In simulations, our proposed quantization method obtains a
substantial improvement in estimating the target parameters over the common
method of employing a parameter grid. Sparse coding techniques are not
appropriate for this problem without proper constraints, while constrained
sparse coding methods perform poorly for parameter estimation because their
objective is signal reconstruction, not estimation of the target parameters.

by a gauge fixing term which we take to be that of DeTurck. For static black
holes analytically continued to Riemannian manifolds without boundary at the
horizon this equation has previously been shown to be elliptic, and Ricci flow
and Newton's method provide good numerical algorithms to solve it. Here we
extend these techniques to the arbitrary cohomogeneity stationary case which
must be treated in Lorentzian signature. For stationary spacetimes with
globally timelike Killing vector the Harmonic Einstein equation is elliptic. In
the presence of horizons and ergo-regions it is less obviously so. Motivated by
the Rigidity theorem we study a class of stationary black hole spacetimes,
considered previously by Harmark, general enough to include the asymptotically
flat case in higher dimensions. We argue the Harmonic Einstein equation
consistently truncates to this class of spacetimes giving an elliptic problem.
The Killing horizons and axes of rotational symmetry are boundaries for this
problem and we determine boundary conditions there. As a simple example we
numerically construct 4D rotating black holes in a cavity using Anderson's
boundary conditions. We demonstrate both Newton's method and Ricci flow to find
these Lorentzian solutions.

we study CMHD in four dimensions at second order in the derivative expansion
assuming the conformal/Weyl invariance. We classify all possible independent
conformal second order viscous corrections to the energy-momentum tensor and to
the U(1) current in the presence of external electric and/or magnetic fields,
and identify eighteen terms that originate from the triangle anomaly. We then
propose and motivate the following guiding principle to constrain the CMHD: the
anomaly--induced terms that are even under the time reversal invariance should
not contribute to the local entropy production rate. This allows us to fix
thirteen out of the eighteen transport coefficients that enter the second order
formulation of CMHD. We also relate one of our second order transport
coefficients to the chiral shear waves. Our second subject is hydrodynamics
with (N+1)-gon anomaly in an arbitrary 2N dimensions. The effects from the
(N+1)-gon anomaly appear in hydrodynamics at (N-1)'th order in the derivative
expansion, and we identify precisely N such corrections to the U(1) current.
The time reversal constraint is powerful enough to allow us to find the
analytic expressions for all transport coefficients. We confirm the validity of
our results (and of the proposed guiding principle) by an explicit

integration effectively extends over energies in a range sqrt{t} ~< 1/b, with
exponential suppression of larger values. The transverse charge density at
peripheral distances thus acts as a low-pass filter for the spectral function
and allows one to select energy regions dominated by specific t-channel states,
corresponding to definite exchange mechanisms in the spacelike form factor. We
show that distances b ~ 0.5 - 1.5 fm in the isovector density are maximally
sensitive to the rho meson region, with only a ~10% contribution from
higher-mass states. Soft-pion exchange governed by chiral dynamics becomes
relevant only at larger distances. In the isoscalar density higher-mass states
beyond the omega are comparatively more important. The dispersion approach
suggests that the positive transverse charge density in the neutron at b ~ 1

serve as a sensitive test of the the isoscalar strength in the ~1 GeV mass

exponential moments we establish an asymptotic behaviour of $\p(I(\xi,\eta)>x)$
as $x\to +\infty$, and under similar assumptions on the negative exponential
moments of $\xi$ we obtain a precise asympotic expansion of the density of

for which simple linear techniques are suboptimal -- sometimes greatly so. This
paper develops generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithms for
minimum mean-squared error estimation of a random vector from quantized linear
measurements, notably allowing the linear expansion to be overcomplete or
undercomplete and the scalar quantization to be regular or non-regular. GAMP is
a recently-developed class of algorithms that uses Gaussian approximations in
belief propagation and allows arbitrary separable input and output channels.
Scalar quantization of measurements is incorporated into the output channel
formalism, leading to the first tractable and effective method for
high-dimensional estimation problems involving non-regular scalar quantization.
Non-regular quantization is empirically demonstrated to greatly improve
rate-distortion performance in some problems with oversampling or with
undersampling combined with a sparsity-inducing prior. Under the assumption of
a Gaussian measurement matrix with i.i.d. entries, the asymptotic error
performance of GAMP can be accurately predicted and tracked through the state
evolution formalism. We additionally use state evolution to design MSE-optimal
scalar quantizers for GAMP signal reconstruction and empirically demonstrate
the superior error performance of the resulting quantizers.

conjectured that the principle of spatial coupling is very general and the
phenomenon of threshold saturation applies to a very broad class of graphical
models. In this work, we derive an area theorem for the joint decoder and
empirically show that threshold saturation occurs for this problem. As a
result, we demonstrate near-universal performance for this problem using the

probably related to the accretion disk surrounding the F star. The slow fading
in KU Cyg is probably caused by increases in dust extinction in the disk, and
the subsequent quick brightening may be due to the evaporation of dust
transported inwards through the disk. The extinction excess which caused the
fading may arise from increased mass transfer rate in the system, or from dust
clump ejections from the K giant.

often contain a large number of parameters, reflecting the complicated physics
that governs foreground sources. In this paper, we concentrate on spectral
modeling (neglecting, for instance, bright point source removal from spatial

measure these parameters without large degeneracies, simply because the
foreground spectra are so featureless and generic. However, we show that this
is also an advantage, because it means that the foregrounds can be
characterized to a high degree of accuracy once a small number of parameters
(likely three or four, depending on one's instrumental specifications) are
measured. This provides a simple understanding for why 21 cm foreground
subtraction schemes are able to remove most of the contaminants by suppressing
just a small handful of simple spectral forms. In addition, this suggests that
the foreground modeling process should be relatively simple and will likely not
be an impediment to the foreground subtraction schemes that are necessary for a

extensions of the Standard Model. In general, these extensions have scalar
mediated flavour changing neutral currents which are strongly constrained by
experiment. Various strategies are discussed to control these flavour changing
scalar currents and their phenomenological consequences are analysed. In
particular, scenarios with natural flavour conservation are investigated,
including the so-called type I and type II models as well as lepton-specific
and inert models. Type III models are then discussed, where scalar flavour
changing neutral currents are present at tree level, but are suppressed by
either specific ansatze for the Yukawa couplings or by the introduction of
family symmetries. We also consider the phenomenology of charged scalars in
these models. Next we turn to the role of symmetries in the scalar sector. We
discuss the six symmetry-constrained scalar potentials and their extension into
the fermion sector. The vacuum structure of the scalar potential is analysed,
including a study of the vacuum stability conditions on the potential and its
renormalization-group improvement. The stability of the tree level minimum of
the scalar potential in connection with electric charge conservation and its
behaviour under CP is analysed. The question of CP violation is addressed in
detail, including the cases of explicit CP violation and spontaneous CP
violation. We present a detailed study of weak basis invariants which are odd
under CP. A careful study of spontaneous CP violation is presented, including
an analysis of the conditions which have to be satisfied in order for a vacuum
to violate CP. We present minimal models of CP violation where the vacuum phase
is sufficient to generate a complex CKM matrix, which is at present a
requirement for any realistic model of spontaneous CP violation.

Several methods exist to analyze changing communities, but most of these are

existing methods are more concerned with change at the community level than at
the level of the individual node. In this paper, we introduce scaled
inclusivity, which is a method to quantify the change in community structure
across networks. Scaled inclusivity evaluates the consistency of the
classiffication of every node in a network independently. In addition, the
method can be applied cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. In this
paper, we calculate the scaled inclusivity for a set of simulated networks of
United States cities and a set of real networks consisting of teams that play
in the top division of American college football. We found that scaled
inclusivity yields reasonable results for the consistency of individual nodes
in both sets of networks. We propose that scaled inclusivity may provide a
useful way to quantify the change in a network's community structure.

line-of-sight velocities for the LMC's space motion and accounting for
asymmetric drift in the AGB population, we derive a rotation curve that is
consistent with all of the tracers used, as well as that of published HI data.
The amplitude of the rotation curve is v_0=87+/-5 km s^-1 beyond a radius
R_0=2.4+/-0.1 kpc, and has a position angle of the kinematic line of nodes of
theta=142 degrees +/-5 degrees. By examining the outliers from our fits, we
identify a population of 376 stars, or >~5% of our sample, that have
line-of-sight velocities that apparently oppose the sense of rotation of the
LMC disk. We find that these kinematically distinct stars are either
counter-rotating in a plane closely aligned with the LMC disk, or rotating in
the same sense as the LMC disk, but in a plane that is inclined by 54 degrees
+/- 2 degrees to the LMC. Their kinematics clearly link them to two known HI
arms, which have previously been interpreted as being pulled out from the LMC.
We measure metallicities from the Ca triplet lines of ~1000 LMC field stars and
30 stars in the kinematically distinct population. For the LMC field, we find a
median [Fe/H]=-0.56 +/- 0.02 with dispersion of 0.5 dex, while for the
kinematically distinct stars the median [Fe/H] is -1.25 +/- 0.13 with a
dispersion of 0.7 dex. The metallicity differences provide strong evidence that
the kinematically distinct population originated in the SMC. This
interpretation has the consequence that the HI arms kinematically associated
with the stars are likely falling into the LMC, instead of being pulled out.

regular LDPC codes known as separable, circulant-based (SCB) codes. For a
specified circulant matrix, SCB codes all share a common mother matrix,
examples of which are array-based LDPC codes and many common quasi-cyclic
codes. SCB codes retain the standard properties of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes such
as girth, code structure, and compatibility with efficient decoder
implementations. In this paper, we define a cycle consistency matrix (CCM) for
each absorbing set of interest in an SCB LDPC code. For an absorbing set to be
present in an SCB LDPC code, the associated CCM must not be full columnrank.
Our approach selects rows and columns from the SCB mother matrix to
systematically eliminate dominant absorbing sets by forcing the associated CCMs
to be full column-rank. We use the CCM approach to select rows from the SCB
mother matrix to design SCB codes of column weight 5 that avoid all low-weight
absorbing sets (4, 8), (5, 9), and (6, 8). Simulation results demonstrate that
the newly designed code has a steeper error-floor slope and provides at least
one order of magnitude of improvement in the low error rate region as compared
to an elementary array-based code.

that break lepton number and we do not assume any a priori hierarchy in the

level of complexity, defined by the number of extra fermionic degrees of
freedom. The simplest choice that has enough free parameters in principle (i.e.
two mass differences and two angles) to explain the confirmed solar and
atmospheric oscillations corresponds to $n_R=1$. This minimal choice is shown
to be excluded by data. The next-to-minimal choice corresponds to $n_R=2$. We
perform a systematic study of the full parameter space in the limit of
degenerate Majorana masses by requiring that at least two neutrino mass
differences correspond to those established by solar and atmospheric
oscillations. We identify several types of spectra that can fit long-baseline
reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation data, but fail in explaining solar
and/or atmospheric data. The only two solutions that survive are the expected
seesaw and quasi-Dirac regions, for which we set lower and upper bounds

galaxies in low density environments can be subject to enhanced forces. The
class of scalar-tensor theories, which includes f(R) gravity, predict such a
force enhancement (massive galaxies like the Milky Way can evade it through a
screening mechanism that protects the interior of the galaxy from this ""fifth""
force). We study observable deviations from GR in the disks of late-type dwarf
galaxies moving under gravity. The fifth-force acts on the dark matter and HI
gas disk, but not on the stellar disk owing to the self-screening of main
sequence stars. We find four distinct observable effects in such disk galaxies:
1. A displacement of the stellar disk from the HI disk. 2. Warping of the
stellar disk along the direction of the external force. 3. Enhancement of the
rotation curve measured from the HI gas compared to that of the stellar disk.
4. Asymmetry in the rotation curve of the stellar disk. We estimate that the
spatial effects can be up to 1 kpc and the rotation velocity effects about 10
km/s in infalling dwarf galaxies. Such deviations are measurable: we expect
that with a careful analysis of a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies one can
improve astrophysical constraints on gravity theories by over three orders of
magnitude, and even solar system constraints by one order of magnitude. Thus
effective tests of gravity along the lines suggested by Hui et al (2009) and
Jain (2011) can be carried out with low-redshift galaxies, though care must be
exercised in understanding possible complications from astrophysical effects.

  <http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0075v1>",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatially coupled codes have been of interest recently owing to their
superior performance over memoryless binary-input channels. The performance is
good both asymptotically, since the belief propagation thresholds approach
capacity, as well as for finite lengths, since degree-2 variables that result
in high error floors can be completely avoided. However, to realize the
promised good performance, one needs large blocklengths. This in turn implies a
large latency and decoding complexity. For the memoryless binary erasure
channel, we consider the decoding of spatially coupled codes through a windowed
decoder that aims to retain many of the attractive features of belief
propagation, while trying to reduce complexity further. We characterize the
performance of this scheme by defining thresholds on channel erasure rates that

consequences of chaos: numerical weather forecast models quickly diverge from
observations as uncertainty in the initial state is amplified by nonlinearity.
One measure of the utility of a forecast is its shadowing time, informally
given by the period of time for which the forecast is a reasonable description
of reality. The present work uses the Lorenz 096 coupled system, a simplified
nonlinear model of atmospheric dynamics, to extend a recently developed
technique for lengthening the shadowing time of a dynamical system. Ensemble
forecasting is used to make forecasts with and without inflation, a method
whereby the ensemble is regularly expanded artificially along dimensions whose
uncertainty is contracting. The first goal of this work is to compare model
forecasts, with and without inflation, to a true trajectory created by
integrating a modified version of the same model. The second goal is to
establish whether inflation can increase the maximum shadowing time for a
single optimal member of the ensemble. In the second experiment the true
trajectory is known a priori, and only the closest ensemble members are
retained at each time step, a technique known as stalking. Finally, a targeted
inflation is introduced to both techniques to reduce the number of instances in
which inflation occurs in directions likely to be incommensurate with the true
trajectory. Results varied for inflation, with success dependent upon the
experimental design parameters (e.g. size of state space, inflation amount).
However, a more targeted inflation successfully reduced the number of forecast
degradations without significantly reducing the number of forecast
improvements. Utilized appropriately, inflation has the potential to improve
predictions of the future state of atmospheric phenomena, as well as other
physical systems.

works, we consider low-lying loops with shallow dips, and use a more realistic
description for the radiative losses. We demonstrate for the first time that
the onset of thermal instability satisfies the linear instability criterion.
The onset time of the condensation is roughly \sim 2 hr or more after the
localized heating at the footpoint is effective, and the growth rate of the
thread length varies from 800 km hr-1 to 4000 km hr-1, depending on the
amplitude and the decay length scale characterizing this localized
chromospheric heating. We show how single or multiple condensation segments may
form in the coronal portion. In the asymmetric heating case, when two segments
form, they approach and coalesce, and the coalesced condensation later drains
down into the chromosphere. With a steady heating, this process repeats with a
periodicity of several hours. While our parametric survey confirms and augments
earlier findings, we also point out that steady heating is not necessary to
sustain the condensation. Once the condensation is formed, it can keep growing
also when the localized heating ceases. Finally, we show that the condensation
can survive continuous buffeting by perturbations resulting from the
photospheric p-mode waves.

binaries in the hard and quiescent states, to determine whether any systems
were sufficiently bright for astrometric follow-up with high-sensitivity very
long baseline interferometric (VLBI) arrays. The one hard-state system, Swift
J1753.5-0127, was detected at a level of 0.5 mJy/beam. All eleven quiescent
systems were not detected. In the three cases with the highest predicted
quiescent radio brightnesses (GRO J0422+32, XTE J1118+480, and GRO J1655-40),
the new capabilities of the Expanded Very Large Array were used to reach noise
levels as low as 2.6 microJy/beam. None of the three sources were detected, to
3-sigma upper limits of 8.3, 7.8, and 14.2 microJy/beam, respectively. These
observations represent the most stringent constraints to date on quiescent
radio emission from black hole X-ray binaries. The uncertainties in the source
distances, quiescent X-ray luminosities at the times of the observations, and
in the power-law index of the empirical correlation between radio and X-ray
luminosities, make it impossible to determine whether these three sources are
significantly less luminous in the radio band than expected. Thus it is not
clear whether that correlation holds all the way down to quiescence for all
black hole X-ray binaries.

Enhanced by the color allowed tree amplitude with large Wilson coefficients
$a_1=C_2+C_1/3$, the branching ratio of $\bar B_s^0\to K^{*+}_0(1430)\rho^-$ is
much larger than those of the other three decays and arrives at
$(3.4^{+0.8}_{-0.7})\times 10^{-5}$ in scenario I, even $10^{-4}$ order in
scenario II, and its direct CP violating asymmetry is the smallest, around 10%,
so this channel might be measurable in the current LHC-b experiments, where a
large number (about $10^{12}$) of $B$ mesons will be produced per year. This
high statistics will make the measurement possible. (b) For the decay modes
$\bar B^0_s\to K^{*0}_0(1430)\omega, K^{*0}_0(1430)\rho^0$, their direct
CP-violating asymmetries are large, but it might be difficult to measure them,
because their branching ratios are small and less than (or near) $10^{-6}$ in
both scenarios. For example, in scenario I, these values are ${\cal B}(\bar
B_s^0\to K^*_0(1430)\omega)=(8.2^{+1.8}_{-1.7})\times 10^{-7}, {\cal B}(\bar

K^*_0(1430)\phi$, the predicted branching ratios are also small and a few times
$10^{-7}$ in both scenarios; there is no tree contribution at the leading

integrates asymptotic analysis with logarithmic granularities, and is an
extension and a complement to polynomial time (Turing) reduction (PTR). Prove
by AGR that inverting y = x ^ x (mod p) is computationally harder than
inverting y = g ^ x (mod p), and inverting y = g ^ (x ^ n) (mod p) is
computationally equivalent to inverting y = g ^ x (mod p), which are compatible
with the results from PTR. Besides, apply AGR to the comparison of inverting y
= x ^ n (mod p) with y = g ^ x (mod p), y = g ^ (g1 ^ x) (mod p) with y = g ^ x
(mod p), and y = x ^ n + x + 1 (mod p) with y = x ^ n (mod p) in difficulty,

all robots to meet in finite time at a non-predefined location. It is known
that the solvability of Byzantine gathering strongly depends on a number of
system attributes, such as synchrony, the number of Byzantine robots,
scheduling strategy, obliviousness, orientation of local coordinate systems and
so on. However, the complete characterization of the attributes making
Byzantine gathering solvable still remains open.
  In this paper, we show strong impossibility results of Byzantine gathering.
Namely, we prove that Byzantine gathering is impossible even if we assume one
Byzantine fault, an atomic execution system, the n-bounded centralized
scheduler, non-oblivious robots, instantaneous movements and a common
orientation of local coordinate systems (where n denote the number of correct
robots). Those hypotheses are much weaker than used in previous work, inducing
a much stronger impossibility result.
  At the core of our impossibility result is a reduction from the distributed
consensus problem in asynchronous shared-memory systems. In more details, we
newly construct a generic reduction scheme based on the distributed
BG-simulation. Interestingly, because of its versatility, we can easily extend

improvements in terms of error rates at practical SNRs with respect to the
conventional LZF proposed in the literature. We also show that these gains are
realized provided that channel gains are controlled to be near constant, for
example, by means of power control and opportunistic carrier and user selection
strategies. In presence of relatively-small variations in the normalized
channel coefficient amplitudes, CJ alignment strategy yields very disappointing
results at finite SNRs, and the gain of LD over ZLF significantly reduces. In
light of these results, the practical applicability of CJ alignment scheme
remains questionable, in particular for Rayleigh fading channels, where channel
inversion power control yields to unbounded average transmit power.

between a hydrophilic sphere and a textured super-hydrophobic plane, that
contains trapped gas bubbles. A super-hydrophobic wall is characterized by
parameters $L$ (texture characteristic length), $b_1$ and $b_2$ (local slip
lengths at solid and gas areas), and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ (fractions of solid
and gas areas). Hydrodynamic properties of the plane are fully expressed in
terms of the effective slip-length tensor with eigenvalues that depend on
texture parameters and $H$ (local separation). The effect of effective slip is
predicted to decrease the force as compared with expected for two hydrophilic
surfaces and described by the Taylor equation. The presence of additional
length scales, $L$, $b_1$ and $b_2$, implies that a film drainage can be much
richer than in case of a sphere moving towards a hydrophilic plane. For a large
(compared to $L$) gap the reduction of the force is small, and for all textures
the force is similar to expected when a sphere is moving towards a smooth
hydrophilic plane that is shifted down from the super-hydrophobic wall. The
value of this shift is equal to the average of the eigenvalues of the
slip-length tensor. By analyzing striped super-hydrophobic surfaces, we then
compute the correction to the Taylor equation for an arbitrary gap. We show
that at thinner gap the force reduction becomes more pronounced, and that it
depends strongly on the fraction of the gas area and local slip lengths. For
small separations we derive an exact equation, which relates a correction for
effective slip to texture parameters. Our analysis provides a framework for
interpreting recent force measurements in the presence of super-hydrophobic
surface.

conservation properties of the alternating direction implicit finite-difference
time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method which is a popular scheme for solving the 3D
Maxwell equations. Precisely, for the case with a perfectly electric conducting
(PEC) boundary condition we establish the optimal second-order error estimates
in both space and time in the discrete $H^1$-norm for the ADI-FDTD scheme and
prove the approximate divergence preserving property that if the divergence of
the initial electric and magnetic fields are zero then the discrete $L^2$-norm
of the discrete divergence of the ADI-FDTD solution is approximately zero with
the second-order accuracy in both space and time. A key ingredient is two new
discrete energy norms which are second-order in time perturbations of two new
energy conservation laws for the Maxwell equations introduced in this paper.
Furthermore, we prove that, in addition to two known discrete energy identities
which are second-order in time perturbations of two known energy conservation
laws, the ADI-FDTD scheme also satisfies two new discrete energy identities
which are second-order in time perturbations of the two new energy conservation
laws. This means that the ADI-FDTD scheme is unconditionally stable under the

non-Markovianity of classical and quantum processes. The well-established
definition for non-Markovianity of a classical stochastic process represents a
condition on the Kolmogorov hierarchy of the n-point joint probability
distributions. Since this definition cannot be transferred to the quantum
regime, quantum non-Markovianity has recently been defined and quantified in
terms of the underlying quantum dynamical map, using either its divisibility
properties or the behavior of the trace distance between pairs of initial
states. Here, we investigate and compare these definitions and their relations
to the classical notion of non-Markovianity by employing a large class of
non-Markovian processes, known as semi-Markov processes, which admit a natural
extension to the quantum case. A number of specific physical examples is
constructed which allow to study the basic features of the classical and the
quantum definitions and to evaluate explicitly the measures for quantum
non-Markovianity. Our results clearly demonstrate several fundamental
distinctions between the classical and the quantum notion of non-Markovianity,
as well as between the various quantum measures for non-Markovianity.

phase, planetesimals and planetary embryos were forming and differentiating due
to the decay of short-lived radionuclides. At the same time, giant planets
formed their cores and accreted the nebular gas to reach their present masses.
After the gas dispersal, the Primordial Solar System began its evolution. In

in combination with the gravitational perturbations of the giant planets,
depleted the residual population of planetesimals. In the outer Solar System,
giant planets underwent a violent, chaotic phase of orbital rearrangement which
caused the Late Heavy Bombardment. Then the rapid and fierce evolution of the

matched by variations in semi-major axes among three bodies with the outer two
bodies moving in the same direction and the inner one moving in the opposite
direction, as would be expected from the two quantities that are conserved in
the three-body resonance. A resonance overlap criterion is derived for the
closely and equally spaced, equal mass system with three-body resonances
overlapping when interplanetary separation is less than an order unity factor
times the planet mass to the one quarter power. We find that three-body
resonances are sufficiently dense to account for wander in semi-major axis seen
in numerical integrations of closely spaced systems and they are likely the
cause of instability of these systems. For interplanetary separations outside
the overlap region, stability timescales significantly increase. Crudely
estimated diffusion coefficients in eccentricity and semi-major axis depend on
a high power of planet mass and interplanetary spacing. An exponential
dependence previously fit to stability or crossing timescales is likely due to
the limited range of parameters and times possible in integration and the
strong power law dependence of the diffusion rates on these quantities.

large. This may be a contributing reason for the observed outward convection of

asymmetry is most significant in regions with low temperature gradients. In the
trapped electron mode dominated case also an up-down asymmetry can lead to a
sign change in the peaking factor from positive to negative. The effect of ion

the Crab has been considered until now substantially stable at X-ray and

September 2010 of a very intense transient gamma-ray flare of nebular origin.
For the first time, the Crab Nebula was ""caught in the act"" of accelerating
particles up to 10^15 eV within the shortest timescale ever observed in a
cosmic nebula (1 day or less). Emission between 50 MeV and a few GeV was
detected with a quite hard spectrum within a short timescale. Additional

flaring gamma-ray episodes detected by AGILE and Fermi during the period
mid-2007/mid-2011. These observations challenge emission models of the pulsar

arising in the BCFW-representation when the amplitudes do not vanish as some

a boundary term can be expressed as a sum of products of two on-shell
amplitudes with fewer external states and a factor dependent on the location of
the relevant zeroes and poles. This allows us to recast the amplitudes to have
the standard BCFW-structure, weighted by a simple factor dependent on a subset
of zeroes and poles of the amplitudes. We further comment on the physical
interpretation of the zeroes as a particular kinematic limit in the
complexified momentum space. The main implication of the existence of such

models motor torque generation based on experimental torque-speed curves and
torque-dependent switching based on the conformational spread model. The model
successfully reproduces the observed switching rate as a function of the
rotation speed, and provides a generic physical explanation independent of most
details. A stator affects the switching dynamics through two mechanisms:
accelerating the conformation flipping rates of individual rotor switching
units, which favours slower motor speed and thus increasing torque; and
affecting more switching units within unit time, which favours faster speed.
Consequently, the switching rate shows a maximum at intermediate speed. Our
model predicts that a motor switches more often with more stators. The
load-switching relation may serve as a mechanism for sensing the physical
environment, similar to the chemotaxis system for sensing the chemical
environment. It may also coordinate the switch dynamics of motors within a

theory is a set of equations, which provides the gradient of the merit function
with respect to parameters that control the shape of the driving field. We show
that these equations can be straightforwardly derived using the standard linear
response theory, only requiring a minor generalization -- the unperturbed
Hamiltonian is allowed to be time-dependent. As a result, the aforementioned
gradients are identified with certain response functions. This identification
leads to a natural reformulation of QOCT in term of the Keldysh contour
formalism of the quantum many-body theory. In particular, the gradients of the
merit function can be calculated using the diagrammatic technique for
non-equilibrium Green's functions, which should be helpful in the application

diluted ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice model, i.e. ferromagnetic coupling of local
moment and electron spin. To do this we use a coherent potential approximation
(CPA) with a dynamical alloy analogy. For the CPA we need effective potentials,
which we get first from a mean-field approximation. To improve this treatment
we use in the next step a more appropriate moment conserving decoupling
approach and compare both methods. The different magnetic phases are modelled
by defining two magnetic sublattices. As a result we present zero-temperature
phase diagrams according to the important model parameters and different
dilutions.

image of the supernova remnant(SNR) G76.9+1.0. The SNR has a bipolar structure
and the point source is located near a faint bridge of emission joining the two
lobes of emission. The point source was also detected in follow-up higher
frequency(1170 MHz) observations. The spectral index for the point source
obtained from the GMRT observations is alpha = -2.1. The steep spectrum, as
well as the location of the point source near the centre of the SNR establish
the fact that it is indeed the pulsar J2022+3842 associated with this SNR.
Consistent with this, subsequent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data shows
a point source coincident with the radio point source, as well as diffuse
extended X-ray emission surrounding the unresolved source. However, no pulsed
emission was detected despite deep searches at both 610 MHz and 1160 MHz
although pulsed emission has been seen at 2 GHz with the GBT. It appears that
the most likely reason for not detecting the pulsed signal at the GMRT is
temporal broadening: for the estimated DM towards this SNR, the pulse
broadening time could be as large as tens of milliseconds. The diffuse X-ray
emission is elongated along the same direction as the bipolar structure seen in
the radio. We interpret the radio lobes as having been formed from an
equatorial wind. Although direct detection of pulsed signal has not been
possible, we show convincingly that sensitive, high-resolution, radio imaging
at multiple frequencies is a useful method to search for pulsar candidates.

In analogy to binaries, planetary companions are also thought to be able to
cause higher activity levels in their host stars, although at lower levels.
Especially in X-rays, such influences are hard to detect because coronae of
cool stars exhibit a considerable amount of intrinsic variability. Recently, a
correlation between the mass of close-in exoplanets and their host star's X-ray
luminosity has been detected, based on archival X-ray data from the ROSAT
All-Sky Survey. This finding has been interpreted as evidence for Star-Planet

selection effects due to the flux limit of the X-ray data used and due to the
intrinsic planet detectability of the radial velocity method, and thus does not

derive the orbital parameters of four Be/X-ray binary systems in the SMC,
increasing the number of systems with orbital solutions by a factor of three.
We find one new orbital period, confirm a second and discuss the parameters
with comparison to the Galactic systems. Despite the low metallicity in the
SMC, these binary systems sit amongst the Galactic distribution of orbital
periods and eccentricities, suggesting that metallicity may not play an
important role in the evolution of high-mass X-ray binary systems. A plot of
orbital period against eccentricity shows that the supergiant, Be and low
eccentricity OB transient systems occupy separate regions of the parameter
space; akin to the separated regions on the Corbet diagram. Using a Spearman's

in terms of number and the contribution of background contaminants, e.g.
distant quasars, which we estimate to be at most 24 per cent, but more likely
~17 per cent. To undertake population studies, we define a `complete'

limits below 10^39 erg/s. The luminosity function of this sample is consistent
with a simple power-law. Although we do not find any statistical requirement

lattices of 3d transition metal T atoms, since it has an insulating
large-moment (3.9 muB/Mn) G-type (checkerboard) antiferromagnetic AF ground

versus temperature T from 300 to 1000 K of single crystals of BaMn2As2, and
magnetic inelastic neutron scattering measurements at 8 K and 75As NMR
measurements from 4 to 300 K of polycrystalline samples. The Neel temperature
determined from the chi(T) measurements is TN = 618(3) K. The measurements are
analyzed using the J1-J2-Jc Heisenberg model. Linear spin wave theory for
G-type AF ordering and classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and
molecular field theory calculations of chi(T) and of the magnetic heat capacity
Cmag(T) are presented versus J1, J2 and Jc. We also obtain band theoretical
estimates of the exchange couplings in BaMn2As2. From analyses of our chi(T),
NMR, neutron scattering, and previously published heat capacity data for
BaMn2As2 on the basis of the above theories for the J1-J2-Jc Heisenberg model
and our band-theoretical results, our best estimates of the exchange constants
in BaMn2As2 are J1 = 13 meV, J2/J1 = 0.3 and Jc/J1 = 0.1, which are all
antiferromagnetic. From our classical Monte Carlo simulations of the G-type AF
ordering transition, these exchange parameters predict TN = 640 K for spin S =
5/2, in close agreement with experiment. Using spin wave theory, we also
utilize these exchange constants to estimate the suppression of the ordered
moment due to quantum fluctuations for comparison with the observed value and
again obtain S = 5/2 for the Mn spin.

rule for the solitonic branes which is dual to the wrapping rule for
fundamental branes. This dual wrapping rule can be understood by the presence
of Kaluza-Klein monopoles. Extending our analysis to supersymmetric solitonic
branes with less than or equal to two transverse directions we show that such
solitons are precisely obtained by applying the same dual wrapping rule to
these cases as well. This extended wrapping rule can not be explained by the
standard Kaluza-Klein monopole alone. Instead, it suggests the existence of a
class of generalized Kaluza-Klein monopoles in ten-dimensional string theory.

set of implementations meeting the given system specifications with a boolean
relation K. In such a context a fundamental step in the software (hardware)
synthesis process is finding effective solutions to the functional equation
defined by K. This entails finding a (set of) boolean function(s) F (typically
represented using OBDDs, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams) such that: 1) for
all x for which K is satisfiable, K(x, F(x)) = 1 holds; 2) the implementation
of F is efficient with respect to given implementation parameters such as code
size or execution time. While this problem has been widely studied in digital
hardware synthesis, little has been done in a software synthesis context.
Unfortunately the approaches developed for hardware synthesis cannot be
directly used in a software context. This motivates investigation of effective
methods to solve the above problem when F has to be implemented with software.
In this paper we present an algorithm that, from an OBDD representation for K,
generates a C code implementation for F that has the same size as the OBDD for
F and a WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) at most O(nr), being n = |x| the
