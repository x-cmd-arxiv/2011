also exist around ~1.5-3 Msun stars. However, no planets have been found inside
0.6 AU around clump giants, in contrast to solar-type main-sequence stars, many
of which harbor short-period planets such as hot Jupiters. In this study we
examine the possibility that planets were engulfed by host stars evolving on
the red-giant branch (RGB). We integrate the orbital evolution of planets in
the RGB and helium burning (HeB) phases of host stars, including the effects of
stellar tide and stellar mass loss. Then we derive the critical semimajor axis
(or the survival limit) inside which planets are eventually engulfed by their
host stars after tidal decay of their orbits. Especially, we investigate the
impact of stellar mass and other stellar parameters on the survival limit in
more detail than previous studies. In addition, we make detailed comparison
with measured semimajor axes of planets detected so far, which no previous
study did. We find that the critical semimajor axis is quite sensitive to
stellar mass in the range between 1.7 and 2.1 Msun, which suggests a need for
careful comparison between theoretical and observational limits of existence of
planets. Our comparison demonstrates that all those planets are beyond the
survival limit, which is consistent with the planet-engulfment hypothesis.
However, on the high-mass side (> 2.1 Msun), the detected planets are orbiting
significantly far from the survival limit, which suggests that engulfment by
host stars may not be the main reason for the observed lack of short-period
giant planets. To confirm our conclusion, the detection of more planets around
clump giants, especially with masses > 2.5 Msun, is required.

the device is able to affect the statistical blend of the quantum states (and
that this can be detected) but not the statistics - i.e. the physics of
observables. The ideas of superluminal information transfer, discussed in the
previous paper, are taken forward to develop a notion of absolute space, time
and motion with relativistic effects ascribed to motion through an absolute
reference frame - as the logical consequences dictate, permeated with a
material causing the 'relativistic' effects. The reciprocal nature of the
Lorentz Transform is shown to fail under superluminal signalling - one frame
will be absolutely time dilated and length contacted; thus a full 'Ether
Transformation' (though this cannot be a group) and a velocity addition law are
derived, the Twin's Paradox is reconsidered. It would seem, in Special
Relativity at least, that the phenomenological effects of motion are placed in
an absolute, logical, materialistic setting, rather than a confusing relative
one that, perhaps, allows no further inspection of just 'what it is' causing
the effects. The author then discusses whether this programme can be carried
forward into General Relativity with the space-time distortions ascribable to
changes in the properties of the ether but on the whole describable in 3-space.

matter, is viewed as a problem of coupling Einstein's theory of pure gravity,
formulated as an action principle, to an independently chosen and well defined
field theory of matter. It is well known that this is accomplished in a most
natural way when the matter theory is formulated as a relativistic, Lagrangian
field theory. Special matter models of this type have been available; here a
thermodynamical model that allows for general flows is used. A problem that is
of even older date, one that was pursued vigorously by leading scientists of
the 19'th century, is that of subjecting hydrodynamics and thermodynamics to an
Action Principle. A solution to this problem has been known for some time, but
only under the strong restriction to potential flows.
  A variational principle for general flows has now become available.
  The present paper lifts this theory to the relativistic context, Special
Relativity and General Relativity. The energy momentum tensor has a structure
that is more general than that postulated by Tolman, and different from
proposed generalizations; it appears to be well suited to represent rotational
flows in General Relativity. It incorporates a conserved mass current, the
relativistic analogue of the hydrodynamical equation of continuity.

this paper we examine the actual, practical application of entropy to two
simple systems, the homogeneous slab with fixed boundary values of the
temperature, and an isolated atmosphere in the presence of the static
gravitational field. The first gives valuable insight into the nature of
entropy that is subsequently applied to the second system.
  It is a basic tenet of thermodynamics that the equilibrium of an extended,
homogeneous and isolated system is characterized by a uniform temperature
distribution and it is a strongly held belief that this remains true in the
presence of gravity. We find that this is consistent with the equations of
extended thermodynamics but that entropy enters in an essential way. The
principle of equivalence takes on a new aspect.

to traditional erasure coding techniques. For practical usability in open and
adversarial environments, as is typical in peer-to-peer systems, we need
however not only resilience against erasures, but also from (adversarial)

codes (supporting multi-repairs, using collaboration among newcomers) in the
presence of two classes of Byzantine nodes, relatively benign selfish

nodes. We give upper bounds on the resilience capacity of regenerating codes,

growth of new inexperienced users creates new challenges for information

relevant documents that satisfy their individual needs. Certainly the current
search engines (such as Google, Bing and Yahoo) offer an efficient way to
browse the web content. However, the result quality is highly based on uses
queries which need to be more precise to find relevant documents. This task
still complicated for the majority of inept users who cannot express their
needs with significant words in the query. For that reason, we believe that a
reformulation of the initial user's query can be a good alternative to improve
the information selectivity. This study proposes a novel approach and presents
a prototype system called PRESY (Profile-based REformulation SYstem) for
information retrieval on the web. Approach: It uses an incremental approach to
categorize users by constructing a contextual base. The latter is composed of
two types of context (static and dynamic) obtained using the users' profiles.
The architecture proposed was implemented using .Net environment to perform
queries reformulating tests. Results: The experiments gives at the end of this
article show that the precision of the returned content is effectively
improved. The tests were performed with the most popular searching engine (i.e.
Google, Bind and Yahoo) selected in particular for their high selectivity.
Among the given results, we found that query reformulation improve the first
three results by 10.7% and 11.7% of the next seven returned elements. So as we
can see the reformulation of users' initial queries improves the pertinence of
returned content.

problem (a.k.a. FTFA problem in \cite{shihongftfa}). In the problem, we are
given a set of sites equipped with an unconstrained number of facilities as
resources, and a set of clients with set $\mathcal{R}$ as corresponding
connection requirements, where every facility belonging to the same site has an
identical opening (operating) cost and every client-facility pair has a
connection cost. The objective is to allocate facilities from sites to satisfy
$\mathcal{R}$ at a minimum total cost. Next, we introduce the Constrained
Fault-Tolerant Resource Allocation (CFTRA) problem. It differs from UFTRA in
that the number of resources available at each site $i$ is limited by $R_{i}$.
Both problems are practical extensions of the classical Fault-Tolerant Facility
Location (FTFL) problem \cite{Jain00FTFL}. For instance, their solutions
provide optimal resource allocation (w.r.t. enterprises) and leasing (w.r.t.
clients) strategies for the contemporary cloud platforms.
  In this paper, we consider the metric version of the problems. For UFTRA with
uniform $\mathcal{R}$, we present a star-greedy algorithm. The algorithm
achieves the approximation ratio of 1.5186 after combining with the cost
scaling and greedy augmentation techniques similar to
\cite{Charikar051.7281.853,Mahdian021.52}, which significantly improves the
result of \cite{shihongftfa} using a phase-greedy algorithm. We also study the
capacitated extension of UFTRA and give a factor of 2.89. For CFTRA with
uniform $\mathcal{R}$, we slightly modify the algorithm to achieve
1.5186-approximation. For a more general version of CFTRA, we show that it is
reducible to FTFL using linear programming.

and synthetic genetic oscillators. A single gene with negative transcriptional
feedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the
transmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A
single gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce
oscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction
with a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine
a model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive
feedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and
activates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a
repressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A
stochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic
study identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two
types of biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and
this protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual
negative interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting
on the positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient
condition to produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive
transcriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor
gene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop
is not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the
formation of protein multimers. Therefore, our findings could help to clarify
the design principles of cellular clocks and constitute a new efficient tool
for engineering synthetic genetic oscillators.

context of Brans-Dicke theory by considering the presence of a dark energy
component with a super-negative equation of state called phantom energy as a
background. Besides Hawking evaporation, here we consider two type of
accretions - radiation accretion and phantom energy accretion. We found that
radiation accretion increases the lifetime of primordial black holes whereas
phantom accretion decreases the lifespan of primordial black holes.
Investigating the competition between the radiation accretion and phantom
accretion, we got that there is an instant during the matter-dominated era
beyond which phantom accretion dominates radiation accretion. So the primordial
black holes which are formed in the later part of radiation dominated era and
in matter dominated era are evaporated at a quicker rate than the Hawking
evaporation. But for presently evaporating primordial black holes, radiation
accretion and Hawking evaporation terms are dominant over phantom accretion
term and hence presently evaporating primordial black holes are not much
affected by phantom accretion.

Both geometric and purely numerical optimal control approaches are used, the
former providing a generalization of the proposal of Micheli et al [Phys. Rev.
A 67, 013607 (2003)]. While this method is shown not to lead to significant
improvements in terms of time of formation and fidelity of the superposition, a
numerical optimal control approach appears more promising, as it allows to
create an almost perfect superposition, within a time short compared to other
existing protocols. We analyze the robustness of the optimal solution against
atom number variations. Finally, we discuss to which extent these optimal
solutions could be implemented with the state of art technology.

problem then it should be detectable at the TeV energy scale which the large
hadron collider (LHC) is now exploring. One of the main goals of the LHC is the
discovery or exclusion of the R-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM). So far, the SUSY search results are presented in the
context of the constrained MSSM and other specific simplified SUSY models. A
model-independent analysis necessarily relies on the trigger-system of the LHC
detectors. By using the posterior samples of a 20-parameter MSSM, the
phenomenological MSSM, from a fit to indirect collider and cosmological data we
find that there is a significant volume in the MSSM parameter space that would
escape the standard trigger-systems of the detectors. As such, in the absence
of discovery in the current and future LHC runs, it would be difficult if not
impossible to exclude the MSSM unless some dedicated and special triggers are
commissioned or a Higgs boson with mass as predicted by the supersymmetric
models is not found.

excited Efimov trimer provides strong support to the premise of Efimov
universality in bosonic systems. Our study also reveals a rich structure of
bosonic cluster states. Besides the lowest cluster states which behave as

such as medical devices. They usually have associated timing constraints that
need to be verified for the implementation. Here, we use an untimed bounded
model checker to verify timing properties of embedded C programs. We propose an
approach to specify discrete time timing constraints using code annotations.
The annotated code is then automatically translated to code that manipulates
auxiliary timer variables and is thus suitable as input to conventional,
untimed software model checker such as ESBMC. Thus, we can check timing
constraints in the same way and at the same time as untimed system
requirements, and even allow for interaction between them. We applied the
proposed method in a case study, and verified timing constraints of a pulse
oximeter, a noninvasive medical device that measures the oxygen saturation of
arterial blood.

is based on Givental's higher genus reconstruction formalism applied to the
settings of Saito's Frobenius structures for simple elliptic singularities. Our
results are part of a larger project whose goal is to prove the
Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for simple elliptic singularities.
The correspondence describes a relation between Gromov-Witten theory (of a
certain hypersurface) and Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory (of a certain
Landau-Ginzburg potential). Roughly, the main statement is that the Saito's
Frobenius manifold for simple elliptic singularities has some special points
such that locally near these points the Frobenius structure governs one of the
two theories. The local part of the correspondence is established in a
companion article by M. Krawitz and Y. Shen, while here we describe the global
picture.

  theory","63 Pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While it is widely acknowledged that quantum theory is strange, and that the
world view it implies is elusive, there is considerably less consensus as to
why this is the case. This article will explore the possibility that the theory
may be opaque because the mathematical language it employs is inarticulate. To
address this possibility, three interconnected mathematical theories will be
developed, each specifically designed to handle aspects of quantum theory's
subject matter. The first will describe dynamic systems in terms that are
general enough to be applicable to any kind dynamics, including both classical
and quantum. That description will then be used to construct a theory of
experiments, with the aim of understanding what types of experiments scientific
methodology allows. Finally, the theory of experiments will found a theory of
experimental probabilities applicable to any collection of experiments, so long
as their probabilities are internally consistent. The resulting over-arching
mathematical language will then be applied to quantum theory. In the initial
application, it will be used to explain the core nature and structure of
quantum measurement and probability. Following that, it will be used to explore
quantum theory's models. Like any theory written in a mathematical language,
quantum theory derives its meaning from its class of models. To understand the
class quantum models, two models of central importance will be described. The
first will be a conceptually simple construction that follows almost
immediately from the above theory of dynamics. It fully satisfies both quantum
theory and the above mentioned theory of experimentation; additionally, its
macroscopic objects obey classical mechanics. The second will utilize a minimal
amount of mathematical structure to satisfy the same conditions.
