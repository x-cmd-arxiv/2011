structural and electronic characters of the intermediary platinum arsenide

layers leads to Tc of 11 K in the 10-3-8 phase and 25 K in the 10-4-8 phase.
Using the chemical concepts of Zintl ion electron counting and the stability of
Pt in the 5d8 configuration we argue that the dramatic difference in Tc arises
because the intermediary layer is semiconducting in the 10-3-8 phase but
metallic in the 10-4-8 phase, leading to enhanced interlayer coupling in the

new road to higher Tc in iron arsenide superconductors.

superconducting single-photon detectors based on earlier published data, and
gated avalanche photodiode detectors based on our own measurements. The
analysis shows that quantum key distribution systems using detector(s) of
either type can be vulnerable to eavesdropping. The avalanche photodiode
detector becomes superlinear towards the end of the gate, allowing
eavesdropping using trigger pulses containing less than 120 photons per pulse.

interconnected aspects. Over the past decade, fusion of multimodality images
has emerged with two different approaches: post-hoc image registration and
combined acquisition on PET-CT, PET-MRI and other hybrid scanners. There are
intrinsic limitations for both the post-hoc image analysis and dual/triple

multipartite entanglement, serves as a universal marker to detect quantum phase
transitions in quantum many-body systems. However, it is very difficult to
compute the geometric entanglement due to the fact that it involves a
complicated optimization over all the possible separable states. In this paper,
we propose a systematic method to efficiently compute the geometric
entanglement per lattice site for quantum many-body lattice systems in two
spatial dimensions in the context of a newly-developed tensor network algorithm
based on an infinite projected entangled pair state representation. It is
tested for quantum Ising model in a transverse magnetic field and anisotropic
spin 1/2 anti-ferromagnetic XYX model in an external magnetic field on an
infinite-size square lattice. In addition, the geometric entanglement per
lattice site is able to detect the so-called factorizing field. Our results are
in a quantitative agreement with Quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

point of view is twofold. On the one hand, this enhancement greatly reconciles
theory and experiment, by alleviating the so-called `little hierarchy problem'
of the minimal SUSY realization, whereby the current experimental limit on the
SM-like Higgs mass is very near its absolute upper limit predicted
theoretically, of 130 GeV. On the other hand, a SM-like Higgs boson with mass
below 200 GeV is still well within the reach of the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), so that the SUSY realization discussed here is just as testable as the
minimal version.

asymptotically flat boundary conditions the Hamiltonian is a sum of bulk

Thanks to new communication
systems and novel technologies, it is today possible to produce and analyze

introduced so far in complex network theory are mainly suited for static
graphs, i.e., graphs in which the links do not change over time, or graphs
built from time-varying systems by aggregating all the links as if they were
concurrent in time. In this paper, we extend the notion of connectedness, and
the definitions of node and graph components, to the case of time-varying
graphs, which are represented as time-ordered sequences of graphs defined over
a fixed set of nodes. We show that the problem of finding strongly connected
components in a time-varying graph can be mapped into the problem of
discovering the maximal-cliques in an opportunely constructed static graph,
which we name the affine graph. It is therefore an NP-complete problem. As a
practical example, we have performed a temporal component analysis of
time-varying graphs constructed from three data sets of human interactions. The
results show that taking time into account in the definition of graph
components allows to capture important features of real systems. In particular,
we observe a large variability in the size of node temporal in- and
out-components. This is due to intrinsic fluctuations in the activity patterns
of individuals, which cannot be detected by static graph analysis.

upon an external system by placing it in thermal contact with a well-selected
range of virtual qubits and temperatures. We demonstrate these claims by
studying the smallest thermal machines. We show further that this perspective
provides a powerful way to view thermodynamics, by analysing a number of
phenomena. This includes approaching Carnot efficiency (where we find that all
machines do so essentially by becoming equivalent to the smallest thermal
machines), entropy production in irreversible machines, and a way to view work
in terms of negative temperature and population inversion. Moreover we
introduce the idea of ""genuine"" thermal machines and are led to considering the

their claimed detection of this pulsar in Fermi gamma-ray data requires no
period derivative, severely restricting its dipole magnetic field strength,
spin-down luminosity, and distance to small values. This implies that the
cooling age of Calvera is much younger than its characteristic spin-down age.
If so, it could be a mildly recycled pulsar, or the first ""orphaned"" central

align the pulse phases of the two X-ray observations with each other, which
indicates that the Fermi detection is almost certainly spurious. Analysis of
additional Fermi data also does not confirm the gamma-ray detection. This
leaves the spin-down rate of Calvera less constrained, and its place among the
families of NSs uncertain. It could still be either a normal pulsar, a mildly
recycled pulsar, or an orphaned CCO.

UV-bright galaxies are no longer the most strongly clustered. We derive mass
estimates for objects in our sample by comparing our measurements to the
predicted clustering of dark matter haloes in the Millennium Simulation. From
these estimates, we infer relationships between halo mass and star formation
rate (SFR), and find that the most massive dark matter haloes in our sample
host galaxies with high SFRs (M_1700 < -20, or > 50 M_sun/yr) at z~3 and 4,
moderate SFRs (-20<M_1700<-19, or ~20 M_sun/yr) at z~2.2, and lower SFRs
(-19<M_1700<-18, or ~2 M_sun/yr) at z~1.7. We believe our measurements may
provide a new line of evidence for galaxy downsizing by extending that concept
from stellar to halo mass. We also find that the objects with blue UV colors in
our sample are much more strongly clustered than those with red UV colors, and
we propose that this may be due to the presence of the 2175A dust absorption
bump in more massive halos, which contain the older stellar populations and
dust needed to produce the feature. The relatively small area covered by the
survey means that the absolute values of the correlation lengths and halo
masses we derive are heavily dependent on the ""integral constraint"" correction,
but the uniformly deep coverage across a large redshift interval allows us to
detect several important trends that are independent of this correction.

analytic continuation of certain L-functions, rely on the well-known rapid
decay of K-finite cusp forms on Siegel sets. We extend this here to prove a
more general decay statement along sets much larger than Siegel sets, and
furthermore state and prove the decay for smooth but not necessarily K-finite
cusp forms. We also state a general theorem about the convergence of
Rankin-Selberg integrals involving unipotent periods, closing a gap in the
literature on L-functions. These properties serve as the analytic basis of a
new method to establish holomorphic continuations of Langlands L-functions, in
particular the exterior square L-functions on GL(n).

analysis indicates that the disk with lower density and higher temperature
hosts larger grains than the companion disk. This result is the opposite of
what predicted by the dust evolution models. The models and observational

than a factor of ten in the two disks, or if the distribution of solids in the

this work the atomistic sp3d5s*-spin-orbit-coupled tight-binding model and the
linearized Boltzmann transport theory is applied to calculate the room
temperature electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and power factor of
narrow 1D silicon nanowires (NWs). We present a comprehensive analysis of the
thermoelectric coefficients of n-type and p-type NWs of diameters from 12nm
down to 3nm, in [100], [110], and [111] transport orientations at different
carrier concentrations. We find that the length scale at which the influence of
confinement on the power factor can be observed is at diameters below 7nm. We
show that contrary to the current view, the effect of confinement and geometry
on the power factor originates mostly from changes in the conductivity which is
strongly affected, rather than the Seebeck coefficient. In general, enhanced
scattering at these diameter scales strongly degrades the conductivity and
power factor of the device. We identify cases, however, for which confinement
largely improves the channel's conductivity, resulting in ~2-3X power factor
improvements. Our results may provide guidance in the design of efficient low

cross-link between hitherto separate domains of machine learning, namely
topographic vector quantization and divergence-based neighbor embedding

as Neighbor Embedding XOM (NE-XOM), (ii) as a powerful optimization scheme for
divergence-based neighbor embedding cost functions inspired by Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (SNE) and its variants, such as t-distributed SNE (t-SNE),
and (iii) as an extension of topographic vector quantization methods, such as
the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). By preserving both global and local data
structure, XIM combines the virtues of classical and advanced recent embedding
methods. It permits direct visualization of large data collections without the
need for prior data reduction. Finally, XIM can contribute to many application
domains of data analysis and visualization important throughout the sciences

and IR colours of galaxies correlate well with each other, as well as with
other galactic properties such as surface brightness and morphology. However
the processes that lead to the observed correlations are contrary; the stellar
light that contributes to the optical is readily absorbed by dust which emits
in the IR. Thus on small scales we expect these correlations to break down. We
examine seven nearby galaxies ranging from early- to late-types, on a
pixel-by-pixel basis and we demonstrate that there is disconnect between the
optical and IR when normalized to the near-IR (H-band). We can decompose this
disconnect into two distinct components through a Principal Component Analysis
of the H-band normalized SED of the pixels: one mainly correlated with
variations in the IR, the other correlated with variations in the optical. By
mapping these two components it is clear they arise from distinct spatial
regions. The IR dominated component is strongly associated with the specific
star-formation rate, while the optical-dominated component is broadly
associated with the stellar mass density. However, when the pixels of all
galaxies are compared, the well known optical-IR colour correlations return,
demonstrating that the variance observed within galaxies is around a mean which
follows the well-known trend. We also examine the extremely strong correlations
between the IRAC-NIR colours and demonstrate that they are tight enough to use
a single IRAC-NIR colour (i.e. 8mum-H) to determine the fluxes in the other
IRAC bands. These correlations arise from the differing contribution of stellar
light and dust to the IRAC bands, enabling us to determine pure stellar colours
for these bands, but still demonstrating the need for dust (or stellar)
corrections in these bands when being used as stellar (dust) tracers.

Randall-Sundrum framework is realized in string theory, and if the Standard
Model particles propagate in the extra dimension, Regge excitations of the
Standard Model states should appear around the TeV scale. In a previous
publication, we proposed a field-theoretic framework to model the tensor

important. In particular, the decay to two KK gluons (with one possibly
off-shell) dominates in most of the parameter space. This decay produces a very
distinctive experimental signature: four highly boosted top quarks. We present
a preliminary study of the detection prospects for this signal at the Large

With design luminosity at 14 TeV, the LHC should be sensitive to Regge gluon

previous recent work showed scaling of an FMM on GPU clusters, with problem
sizes in the order of billions of unknowns. That work led to an extremely
parallel FMM, scaling to thousands of GPUs or tens of thousands of CPUs. This
paper reports on a a campaign of performance tuning and scalability studies
using multi-core CPUs, on the Kraken supercomputer. All kernels in the FMM were
parallelized using OpenMP, and a test using 10^7 particles randomly distributed
in a cube showed 78% efficiency on 8 threads. Tuning of the
particle-to-particle kernel using SIMD instructions resulted in 4x speed-up of
the overall algorithm on single-core tests with 10^3 - 10^7 particles. Parallel
scalability was studied in both strong and weak scaling. The strong scaling
test used 10^8 particles and resulted in 93% parallel efficiency on 2048
processes for the non-SIMD code and 54% for the SIMD-optimized code (which was
still 2x faster). The weak scaling test used 10^6 particles per process, and
resulted in 72% efficiency on 32,768 processes, with the largest calculation
taking about 40 seconds to evaluate more than 32 billion unknowns. This work
builds up evidence for our view that FMM is poised to play a leading role in
exascale computing, and we end the paper with a discussion of the features that
make it a particularly favorable algorithm for the emerging heterogeneous and

cellular automaton; an expert system; and a program coordinator. The code
outputs can be either two-dimensional maps or one-dimensional profiles, which
reproduce the observations with high accuracy, giving detailed physical

logical equivalences induced by PCTL or PCTL*. The desire of a both sound and

under extreme conditions are expected from gravitational wave observations of
binary black hole mergers with a wide range of mass ratios. In addition, major
improvements are planned in both strong and weak equivalence principle tests;
clock measurements based on the ACES program on the ISS; more accurate
light-bending measurements; and other new types of tests. However, whether
these tests are all consistent with general relativity or not, it still appears
desirable to proceed with a much improved measurement of the Shapiro time
delay. A suggested approach is based on using a high-quality optical clock in a
drag-free spacecraft near the sun-earth L1 point and a smaller drag-free
transponder spacecraft in a two-year period solar orbit. Laser phase
travel-time measurements would be made between the two spacecraft over a period
of 10 or 20 days around the time when the line of sight passes through the Sun.
The requirements on the optical clock stability and on the drag-free systems
will be discussed. The accuracy achievable for the time-delay appears to be
better than 1 part in 100 million.

roughly a factor of four compared to standard encoding circuits. By adapting

moving in small scale turbulent magnetic fields expected in high energy
astrophysical sources. Such radiation spectrum is characterized by the strength
parameter $a = \lambda_{B}} e|B|/mc^2$, where $\lambda_{B}}$ is the length
scale of the turbulent field. When $a$ is much larger than the Lorentz factor
of a radiating electron $\gamma$, synchrotron radiation is realized, while
$a\ll 1$ corresponds to the so-called jitter radiation regime. Because for
$1<a<\gamma$ we cannot use either approximations, we should have recourse to
the Lienard-Wiechert potential to evaluate the radiation spectrum, which is
performed in this paper. We generate random magnetic fields assuming Kolmogorov
turbulence, inject monoenergetic electrons, solve the equation of motion, and
calculate the radiation spectrum. We perform numerical calculations for several
values of $a$ with $\gamma = 10$. We obtain various types of spectra ranging
between jitter radiation and synchrotron radiation. For $a\sim 7$, the spectrum
turns out to take a novel shape which has not been noticed up to now. It is
like a synchrotron spectrum in the middle energy region, but in the low
frequency region it is a broken power law and in the high frequency region an
extra power law component appears beyond the synchrotron cutoff. We give a
physical explanation of these features.

structures, which are barriers to transport, by examining the stretching field
as given by finite-time Lyapunov exponents. These methods are very effective
when the velocity field is well-determined, but in many applications only a
small number of flow trajectories are known, for example when dealing with
oceanic float data. We introduce a topological method for detecting invariant
regions based on a small set of trajectories. In the method we regard the
two-dimensional trajectory data as a braid in three dimensions, with time being
the third coordinate. Invariant regions then correspond to trajectories that
travel together and do not entangle other trajectories. We detect these regions
by examining the growth of hypothetical loops surrounding sets of trajectories,
and searching for loops that show negligible growth.

studied analytically in the regime of weak magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We
find that residual energy is spontaneously generated by turbulent dynamics, and
it has a negative sign, in good agreement with the observations. We obtain that

linearly with k_perp, where k_|| and k_perp are the wavenumbers parallel and

these processes to reach arbitrarily large heights (in the sense of the height
process associated with $X$) before hitting 0.
  This way we obtain a new conditioning of L\'evy processes to stay positive.
  The (honest) law $\pfl$ of this conditioned process is defined as a Doob
$h$-transform via a martingale. For L\'evy processes with infinite variation
paths, this martingale is $(\int\tilde\rt(\mathrm{d}z)e^{\alpha z}+I_t)\2{t\leq
T_0}$ for some $\alpha$ and where $(I_t,t\geq0)$ is the past infimum process of
$X$, where $(\tilde\rt,t\geq0)$ is the so-called \emph{exploration process}
defined in Duquesne, 2002, and where $T_0$ is the hitting time of 0 for $X$.
Under $\pfl$, we also obtain a path decomposition of $X$ at its minimum, which
enables us to prove the convergence of $\pfl$ as $x\to0$.
  When the process $X$ is a compensated compound Poisson process, the previous
martingale is defined through the jumps of the future infimum process of $X$.
The computations are easier in this case because $X$ can be viewed as the
contour process of a (sub)critical \emph{splitting tree}. We also can give an
alternative characterization of our conditioned process in the vein of spine
decompositions.

motion of a particle sliding on an inclined plane is investigated for general
values of friction coefficient ($\mu$). A parametric equation for the
trajectory of the particle is also obtained. In the second part of the article
the motion of a sphere on the inclined plane is studied. It is shown that the
evolution equation for the contact point of a sliding sphere is similar to that
of a point particle sliding on an inclined plane whose friction coefficient is
$2/7}\ \mu$. If $\mu> 2/7 \tan\theta$, for any arbitrary initial velocity and
angular velocity the sphere will roll on the inclined plane after some finite
time. In other cases, it will slip on the inclined plane. In the case of
rolling center of the sphere moves on a parabola. Finally the velocity and
angular velocity of the sphere are exactly computed.

K, by measuring flux-creep over the second magnetisation (or fish-tail) peak
for both H//c-axis and H//ab planes. Magnetic relaxation data show an
anomalously long initial stage of relaxation, lasting approximately10 minutes
for H//c-axis and 2-3 min for H//ab, resembling a transient effect with a lower
relaxation rate, which is followed by the usual log(time) relaxation.
Interestingly, study of the relaxation rate R vs H for both stages of
relaxation and for both field directions, are featureless over the field range
associated with the fish-tail. The same trend was confirmed by plotting R vs T
obtained from flux-creep data measured as a function of temperature for a fixed
field (H//$c-axis). A plot of the activation energy U(M,T) calculated from the
time relaxation of the magnetisation at a fixed field also shows a smooth
behavior further supporting the view that the fish-tail peak is not associated
with a crossover in vortex pinning regime within the collective pinning
scenario.

implemented as a theoretical framework for memory storage in networks of
neurons. Activity-dependent modification of synaptic transmission is thought to
be the physiological basis of learning and memory. The goal of this study is to
demonstrate that using a pharmacological perturbation on in vitro networks of
hippocampal neurons that has been shown to increase synaptic strength follows
the dynamical postulates theorized by attractor models. We use a grid of
extracellular electrodes to study changes in network activity after this
perturbation and show that there is a persistent increase in overall spiking
and bursting activity after treatment. This increase in activity appears to
recruit more ""errant"" spikes into bursts. Lastly, phase plots indicate a
conserved activity pattern suggesting that the network is operating in a stable
dynamical state.

doped in PMMA is not due to dye diffusion - a common phenomenon observed in
many dye-doped polymers. The change in linear absorbance due to
photodegradation of the material shows an isobestic point, which is consistent
with the formation of a quasi-stable damaged species. Spatially-resolved
amplified spontaneous emission and fluorescence, both related to the population
density, are measured by scanning the pump beam over a burn mark. A numerical
model of the time evolution of the population density due to diffusion is
inconsistent with the experimental data suggesting that diffusion is not
responsible.

${\max}_{x\in \{\pm 1\}^n} \sum_{ij \in E} w_{ij}x_ix_j$ and its canonical
semidefinite programming relaxation ${\max} \sum_{ij \in E} w_{ij}v_i^Tv_j$,
where the maximum is taken over all unit vectors $v_i\in\R^n$. The integrality
gap of this relaxation is known as the Grothendieck constant $\ka(G)$ of $G$.
We present a closed-form formula for the Grothendieck constant of $K_5$-minor
free graphs and derive that it is at most 3/2. Moreover, we show that
$\ka(G)\le \ka(K_k)$ if the cut polytope of $G$ is defined by inequalities
supported by at most $k$ points. Lastly, since the Grothendieck constant of
$K_n$ grows as $\Theta(\log n)$, it is interesting to identify instances with
large gap. However this is not the case for the clique-web inequalities, a wide
class of valid inequalities for the cut polytope, whose integrality ratio is
shown to be bounded by 3.

interesting challenge for artists. Creating a viable MC Escher like image that
works esthetically as well as functionally requires resolving incongruencies at
a tile's edge while constrained by its shape. Escher was the most well known
practitioner in this style of mathematical visualization, but there are
significant mathematical shapes to which he never applied his artistry. These
shapes can incorporate designs that form images as appealing as those produced
by Escher, and our paper explores this for traditional tessellations, Penrose
Tilings, fractals, and fractal/tessellation combinations. To illustrate the
versatility of tiling art, images were created with multiple figures and
negative space leading to patterns distinct from the work of others.

claims are just words if they are not backed up by sound mathematics. In
pursuit of the fundamental equations I look to string theory where physicists
led by Mike Duff have noticed useful connections between the quantum gravity of
black holes and quantum information theory. By building on my earlier work on
universal symmetry in string theory and using links between elliptic curves and
hyperdeterminants, I find intriguing clues that these connections may be deep
as well as useful. Ultimately any theory of the foundations of physics must
explain why there are four forces and three generations of fermions. In string
theory this would be a consequence of the choice of vacua. If a consistent
formulation of string theory constructed from quantum bits can be found, it may
be possible to understand the vast landscape of possibilities better and
reverse engineer the program that codes our universe.
