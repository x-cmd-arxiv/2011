redundantly labeling examples that contribute little new information. Our work
follows on previous research on Query By Committee, extending the

describe a family of empirical methods for committee-based sample selection in

These variants (the committee) are drawn randomly from a probability
distribution conditioned by the training set labeled so far. The method was
applied to the real-world natural language processing task of stochastic
part-of-speech tagging. We find that all variants of the method achieve a
significant reduction in annotation cost, although their computational
efficiency differs. In particular, the simplest variant, a two member committee
with no parameters to tune, gives excellent results. We also show that sample

In addition, we introduce our new optimistic planning algorithm that relaxes

Wave (SDW) gap. It displays two spectral features that weaken with doping,
which are assigned to two SDW induced electronic transitions. Raman symmetry
arguments are discussed to identify the origin of these electronic transitions
in terms of orbital ordering in the magnetic phase. Our data do not seem
consistent with an orbital ordering scenario and advocate for a more
conventional band-folding picture with two types of electronic transitions in
the SDW state, a high energy transition between two anti-crossed SDW bands and
a lower energy transition involving a folded band that do not anti-cross in the
SDW state. The latter transition could be linked to the presence of Dirac cones
in the electronic dispersion of the magnetic state. The spectra in the SDW
state also show significant coupling between the arsenide optical phonon and

teams of cooperating agents, via Socially-Attentive Monitoring, which focuses
on monitoring for failures in the social relationships between the agents. We
empirically and analytically explore a family of socially-attentive teamwork
monitoring algorithms in two dynamic, complex, multi-agent domains, under
varying conditions of task distribution and uncertainty. We show that a
centralized scheme using a complex algorithm trades correctness for
completeness and requires monitoring all teammates. In contrast, a simple
distributed teamwork monitoring algorithm results in correct and complete
detection of teamwork failures, despite relying on limited, uncertain
knowledge, and monitoring only key agents in a team. In addition, we report on
the design of a socially-attentive monitoring system and demonstrate its
generality in monitoring several coordination relationships, diagnosing
detected failures, and both on-line and off-line applications.

the analysis of WSat on high-cost random instances, using the
recently-introduced concept of the backbone of a SAT instance. The backbone is
the set of literals which are entailed by an instance. We find that the number
of solutions predicts the cost well for small-backbone instances but is much
less relevant for the large-backbone instances which appear near the threshold
and dominate in the overconstrained region. We show a very strong correlation
between search cost and the Hamming distance to the nearest solution early in
WSat's search. This pattern leads us to introduce a measure of the backbone
fragility of an instance, which indicates how persistent the backbone is as
clauses are removed. We propose that high-cost random instances for local
search are those with very large backbones which are also backbone-fragile. We
suggest that the decay in cost beyond the satisfiability threshold is due to
increasing backbone robustness (the opposite of backbone fragility). Our
hypothesis makes three correct predictions. First, that the backbone robustness
of an instance is negatively correlated with the local search cost when other
factors are controlled for. Second, that backbone-minimal instances (which are
3-SAT instances altered so as to be more backbone-fragile) are unusually hard
for WSat. Third, that the clauses most often unsatisfied during search are

the longstanding issues in AI planning. It makes two new contributions. First,
it formally defines and discusses two different goal orderings, which are
called the reasonable and the forced ordering. Both orderings are defined for
simple STRIPS operators as well as for more complex ADL operators supporting
negation and conditional effects. The complexity of these orderings is
investigated and their practical relevance is discussed. Secondly, two
different methods to compute reasonable goal orderings are developed. One of
them is based on planning graphs, while the other investigates the set of
actions directly. Finally, it is shown how the ordering relations, which have
been derived for a given set of goals G, can be used to compute a so-called
goal agenda that divides G into an ordered set of subgoals. Any planner can
then, in principle, use the goal agenda to plan for increasing sets of
subgoals. This can lead to an exponential complexity reduction, as the solution
to a complex planning problem is found by solving easier subproblems. Since
only a polynomial overhead is caused by the goal agenda computation, a
potential exists to dramatically speed up planning algorithms as we demonstrate
in the empirical evaluation, where we use this method in the IPP planner.

predictable and timely. At first blush, these three requirements seem
contradictory. For example, adaptation risks introducing undesirable side
effects, thereby making agents' behavior less predictable. Furthermore,
although formal verification can assist in ensuring behavioral predictability,
it is known to be time-consuming. Our solution to the challenge of satisfying
all three requirements is the following. Agents have finite-state automaton
plans, which are adapted online via evolutionary learning (perturbation)
operators. To ensure that critical behavioral constraints are always satisfied,
agents' plans are first formally verified. They are then reverified after every
adaptation. If reverification concludes that constraints are violated, the
plans are repaired. The main objective of this paper is to improve the
efficiency of reverification after learning, so that agents have a sufficiently
rapid response time. We present two solutions: positive results that certain
learning operators are a priori guaranteed to preserve useful classes of
behavioral assurance constraints (which implies that no reverification is
needed for these operators), and efficient incremental reverification
algorithms for those learning operators that have negative a priori results.

through the skill and insights of experts. In this paper a model for
automatically learning bias is investigated. The central assumption of the
model is that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning
tasks. Within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple tasks,
and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains good solutions to
many of the problems in the environment. Under certain restrictions on the set
of all hypothesis spaces available to the learner, we show that a hypothesis
space that performs well on a sufficiently large number of training tasks will
also perform well when learning novel tasks in the same environment. Explicit

conditional effects cannot be compiled away if plan size should grow only

of the planning domain as a finite state automaton. We use Symbolic Model
Checking techniques, in particular Binary Decision Diagrams, to compactly
represent and efficiently search the automaton. In this paper we make the
following contributions. First, we present a general planning algorithm for
conformant planning, which applies to fully nondeterministic domains, with
uncertainty in the initial condition and in action effects. The algorithm is
based on a breadth-first, backward search, and returns conformant plans of
minimal length, if a solution to the planning problem exists, otherwise it
terminates concluding that the problem admits no conformant solution. Second,
we provide a symbolic representation of the search space based on Binary
Decision Diagrams (BDDs), which is the basis for search techniques derived from
symbolic model checking. The symbolic representation makes it possible to
analyze potentially large sets of states and transitions in a single
computation step, thus providing for an efficient implementation. Third, we
present CMBP (Conformant Model Based Planner), an efficient implementation of
the data structures and algorithm described above, directly based on BDD
manipulations, which allows for a compact representation of the search layers

planners CGP, QBFPLAN and GPT. Our analysis includes all the planning problems
from the distribution packages of these systems, plus other problems defined to

to outperform the existing sampling algorithms consistently. Three sources of
this performance improvement are (1) two heuristics for initialization of the
importance function that are based on the theoretical properties of importance
sampling in finite-dimensional integrals and the structural advantages of
Bayesian networks, (2) a smooth learning method for the importance function,
and (3) a dynamic weighting function for combining samples from different
stages of the algorithm. We tested the performance of the AIS-BN algorithm
along with two state of the art general purpose sampling algorithms, likelihood
weighting (Fung and Chang, 1989; Shachter and Peot, 1989) and self-importance
sampling (Shachter and Peot, 1989). We used in our tests three large real

Nathwani, 1990), and the ANDES network (Conati, Gertner, VanLehn, and Druzdzel,

performed better than the other two algorithms, in the majority of the test
cases it achieved orders of magnitude improvement in precision of the results.
Improvement in speed given a desired precision is even more dramatic, although

schemes and look-back schemes. Unfortunately, look-ahead and look-back schemes
are not entirely orthogonal as it has been observed empirically that the
enhancement of look-ahead techniques is sometimes counterproductive to the
effects of look-back techniques. In this paper, we focus on the relationship
between the two most important look-ahead techniques---using a variable
ordering heuristic and maintaining a level of local consistency during the
backtracking search---and the look-back technique of conflict-directed
backjumping (CBJ). We show that there exists a ""perfect"" dynamic variable
ordering such that CBJ becomes redundant. We also show theoretically that as
the level of local consistency that is maintained in the backtracking search is
increased, the less that backjumping will be an improvement. Our theoretical
results partially explain why a backtracking algorithm doing more in the
look-ahead phase cannot benefit more from the backjumping look-back scheme.
Finally, we show empirically that adding CBJ to a backtracking algorithm that
maintains generalized arc consistency (GAC), an algorithm that we refer to as
GAC-CBJ, can still provide orders of magnitude speedups. Our empirical results
contrast with Bessiere and Regin's conclusion (1996) that CBJ is useless to an

events described by simple spatial-motion verbs in short image sequences. The
semantics of these verbs is specified with event-logic expressions that
describe changes in the state of force-dynamic relations between the
participants of the event. An efficient finite representation is introduced for
the infinite sets of intervals that occur when describing liquid and
semi-liquid events. Additionally, an efficient procedure using this
representation is presented for inferring occurrences of compound events,
described with event-logic expressions, from occurrences of primitive events.
Using force dynamics and event logic to specify the lexical semantics of events
allows the system to be more robust than prior systems based on motion profile.

neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when
classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble is
often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging
(Breiman, 1996c) and Boosting (Freund and Shapire, 1996; Shapire, 1990) are two
relatively new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we
evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks and decision
trees as our classification algorithm. Our results clearly indicate a number of
conclusions. First, while Bagging is almost always more accurate than a single
classifier, it is sometimes much less accurate than Boosting. On the other
hand, Boosting can create ensembles that are less accurate than a single
classifier -- especially when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that
the performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of
the data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting
ensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance.
Finally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the
gain in an ensemble's performance comes in the first few classifiers combined;
however, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting
decision trees.

two notions that appeared at various points in the literature: on the one side,
the quantum length as the spectrum of an operator L in the Doplicher
Fredenhagen Roberts (DFR) quantum spacetime, as well as in the canonical
noncommutative spacetime; on the other side, Connes' spectral distance in
noncommutative geometry. Although on the Euclidean space the two notions merge
into the one of geodesic distance, they yield distinct results in the
noncommutative framework. In particular on the Moyal plane, the quantum length
is bounded above from zero while the spectral distance can take any real
positive value, including infinity. We show how to solve this discrepancy by
doubling the spectral triple. This leads us to introduce a modified quantum
length d'_L, which coincides exactly with the spectral distance d_D on the set
of states of optimal localization. On the set of eigenstates of the quantum
harmonic oscillator - together with their translations - d'_L and d_D coincide
asymptotically, both in the high energy and large translation limits. At small
energy, we interpret the discrepancy between d'_L and d_D as two distinct ways
of integrating the line element on a quantum space. This leads us to propose an
equation for a geodesic on the Moyal plane.

enabling control are identified by simultaneous ionization and measurement of
photoelectron angular distributions employing the velocity map imaging
technique. Free electron wave packets at an energy of around 1 eV are observed.
These photoelectrons originate from two channels. The predominant 2+1+1
Resonance Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) proceeds via the strongly
driven two-photon transition $4s\leftarrow\leftarrow3s$, and subsequent
ionization from the states 5p, 6p and 7p whereas the second pathway involves
3+1 REMPI via the states 5f and 6f. In addition, electron wave packets from
two-photon ionization of the non-resonant transiently populated state 3p are
observed close to the ionization threshold. A mainly qualitative five-state
model for the predominant excitation channel is studied theoretically to
provide insights into the physical mechanisms at play. Our analysis shows that
by tuning the chirp parameter the dynamics is effectively controlled by dynamic
Stark-shifts and level crossings. In particular, we show that under the

level crossing allows the preparation of coherent superposition states.

focused their attention on multi-shell spherical acquisitions with the aim of
effectively mapping the diffusion signal with a lower number of q-space
samples, hence enabling a crucial reduction of acquisition time. One of the
quantities commonly studied in this context is the so-called orientation
distribution function (ODF). In this setting, the spherical harmonic (SH)
transform has gained a great deal of popularity thanks to its ability to
perform convolution operations efficiently and accurately, such as the
Funk-Radon transform notably required for ODF computation from q-space data.
However, if the q-space signal is described with an unsuitable angular
resolution at any b-value probed, aliasing (or interpolation) artifacts are
unavoidably created. So far this aspect has been tackled empirically and, to
our knowledge, no study has addressed this problem in a quantitative approach.
The aim of the present work is to study more theoretically the efficiency of
multi-shell spherical sampling in diffusion MRI, in order to gain understanding
in HYDI-like approaches, possibly paving the way to further optimization
strategies.

generated in a ring-horseshoe distribution in the auroral-kilometric radiation
source region have the capacity to emit band-limited radiation. The radiation
is calculated in the proper frame of a circular model hole and shown to be
strictly perpendicular in this frame. Its bandwidth under auroral conditions is
of the order of $\sim1$ kHz, which is a reasonable value. {It is also shown
that much of the drift of fine structure in the radiation can be interpreted as
Doppler shift. Estimates based on data are in good agreement with theory.
Growth and absorption rates have been obtained for the emitted radiation.
However, the growth rate of a single hole obtained under conservative
conditions is small, too small for reproducing the observed fine structure
flux. Trapping of radiation inside the hole for the hole's lifetime helps
amplifying the radiation additionally but introduces other problems. This
entire set of questions is discussed at length and compared to radiation from
the global horseshoe distribution.} The interior of the hole produces a weak
absorption at slightly higher frequency than emission. The absorptivity is
roughly two orders of magnitude below the growth rate of the radiation thus
being weak even when the emission and absorption bands overlap. Transforming to
the stationary observer's frame it is found that the radiation becomes oblique
against the magnetic field. For approaching holes the radiated frequencies may
even exceed the local electron cyclotron frequency.

bosonic resonator (as measured by a QND detector), using the standard Keldysh
prescription to define higher moments. We find that due to an effective
cascading of fluctuations, these statistics are surprisingly non-classical: the
low-temperature, quantum probability distribution is not equivalent to the
high-temperature classical distribution evaluated at some effective
temperature. Moreover, for a sufficiently large drive detuning and low
temperatures, the Keldysh-ordered quasi-probability distribution characterizing
these fluctuations fails to be positive-definite; this is similar to the full
counting statistics of charge in superconducting systems. We argue that this
indicates a kind of non-classical behaviour akin to that tested by Leggett-Garg
inequalities.

accelerated observers moving in flat spacetime. Relativisitic quantum
information theory uses well-known tools coming from quantum information and
quantum optics to study quantum effects provoked by gravity to learn
information about the spacetime. We can take advantage of our knowledge about

amplify weak magnetic fields up to a few {\mu}G within a few Gyr in barred
galaxies. The obtained e-folding time is equal to 300 Myr and the magnetic
field reaches equipartition at time t ~ 4.0 Gyr. Initially, the completely
random magnetic field evolves into large-scale structures. An even

then the resulting distribution of the number of connections that nodes have
follows power laws observed in many real networks. Preferential attachment has
been directly validated for some real networks, including the Internet.
Preferential attachment can also be a consequence of different underlying
processes based on node fitness, ranking, optimization, random walks, or
duplication. Here we show that popularity is just one dimension of
attractiveness. Another dimension is similarity. We develop a framework where
new connections, instead of preferring popular nodes, optimize certain
trade-offs between popularity and similarity. The framework admits a geometric
interpretation, in which popularity preference emerges from local optimization.
As opposed to preferential attachment, the optimization framework accurately
describes large-scale evolution of technological (Internet), social (web of
trust), and biological (E.coli metabolic) networks, predicting the probability
of new links in them with a remarkable precision. The developed framework can
thus be used for predicting new links in evolving networks, and provides a
different perspective on preferential attachment as an emergent phenomenon.

way they lead to the formation of an organized and functional society are
important issues especially for techno-social development. Addressing these
issues of social networks has recently become possible through large scale data
analysis of e.g. mobile phone call records, which has revealed the existence of
modular or community structure with many links between nodes of the same
community and relatively few links between nodes of different communities. The
weights of links, e.g. the number of calls between two users, and the network
topology are found correlated such that intra-community links are stronger
compared to the weak inter-community links. This is known as Granovetter's ""The
strength of weak ties"" hypothesis. In addition to this inhomogeneous community
structure, the temporal patterns of human dynamics turn out to be inhomogeneous
or bursty, characterized by the heavy tailed distribution of inter-event time
between two consecutive events. In this paper, we study how the community
structure and the bursty dynamics emerge together in an evolving weighted
network model. The principal mechanisms behind these patterns are social
interaction by cyclic closure, i.e. links to friends of friends and the focal
closure, i.e. links to individuals sharing similar attributes or interests, and
human dynamics by task handling process. These three mechanisms have been
implemented as a network model with local attachment, global attachment, and
priority-based queuing processes. By comprehensive numerical simulations we
show that the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the emergence of heavy
tailed inter-event time distribution and the evolution of Granovetter-type
community structure. Moreover, the numerical results are found to be in
qualitative agreement with empirical results from mobile phone call dataset.

consistent with the radiation pressure instability and the evolution of a local
Eddington limit in the inner disk. We exploit strong variations in the X-ray
continuum, iron emission lines, and the accretion disk wind to probe the
accretion geometry over nearly six orders of magnitude in distance from the
black hole. At small scales (1-10 R_g), we detect a burst of bremsstrahlung
emission that appears to occur when a portion of the inner accretion disk
evaporates due to radiation pressure. Jet activity, as inferred from the
appearance of a short X-ray hard state, seems to be limited to times near
minimum luminosity, with a duty cycle of ~10%. On larger scales (1e5-1e6 R_g)
we use detailed photoionization arguments to track the relationship between the
fast X-ray variability and the accretion disk wind. For the first time, we are
able to show that changes in the broadband X-ray spectrum produce changes in
the structure and density of the accretion disk wind on timescales as short as
5 seconds. These results clearly establish a causal link between the X-ray
oscillations and the disk wind and therefore support the existence of a
disk-jet-wind connection. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the mass loss
rate in the wind may be sufficient to cause long-term oscillations in the
accretion rate, leading to state transitions in GRS 1915+105.

the case without allowing for early DE. The constraints for a space-based

density at high redshift, if not accounted for in future analyses, biases the
cosmological parameters by up to 2 sigma. Our analysis suggests that throwing
out nonlinear scales (multipoles > 1000) may not result in significant
degradation in future parameter measurements when multiple cosmological probes

sensitively on the gas metallicity, because metals are crucial to mediating the
transition from intermediate-temperature atomic gas to cold molecular gas, a
necessary precursor to star formation. We study the impact of this effect on
the star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent
star formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the
evolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect
of metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark
halos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for
halos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch
up with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall
time, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in
each galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated
cosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z
makes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that
the specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas
at high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional
fuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows
the SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow
rate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the
universal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the
expected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a
given z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat
and rising respectively. Our model predictions qualitatively match some of the
puzzling features in the observed star formation history.

membranes. Our original model consisted of two graphene plates with attached
polar headgroups; the plates were immersed in a water bath. The interaction
between such plates can be considered as an example of a hydrophilic
interaction. In the present work we modify our previous model by removing the
charge from the zwitterionic headgroups. As a result of this procedure, the
plate character changes; it becomes hydrophobic. By separating the total
interaction (or potential of mean force, PMF) between plates into the direct
and the water-mediated interactions we observe that the latter changes from
repulsive to attractive, clearly emphasizing the important role of water as a
medium. We also investigate the effect of roughness and flexibility of the
headgroups on the interaction between plates and observe that roughness
enhances the character of the hydrophobic interaction. The presence of a
dewetting transition in a confined space between charge-removed plates confirms
that the interaction between plates is strongly hydrophobic. In addition, we
notice that there is a shallow local minimum in the PMF in case of
charge-removed plates. We find that this minimum is associated with the
configurational changes that flexible headgroups undergo, as the two plates are
brought together.

and $G_N$ may be neglected, while their ratio, the Planck mass $M_p
=\sqrt{\hbar / G_N}$, is important. We propose that $M_p$ governs the scale at
which momentum space may have a curved geometry. We find that there are
striking consequences for the concept of locality. The description of events in
spacetime now depends on the energy used to probe it. But there remains an
invariant description of physics in phase space. There is furthermore a
reasonable expectation that the geometry of momentum space can be measured
experimentally using astrophysical observations.

where the late-time accelerated expansion is driven by a quintessence field
with vanishing speed of sound. For these models matter and quintessence
perturbations are comoving and it is possible to write a single continuity
equation for the total density fluctuations given by a weighted sum of the two
components. Including the Euler equation for the common velocity field we solve
the evolution equations for the nonlinear, total density power spectrum in the
Time-Renormalization Group approach. In fact any cosmological observable is
directly related by gravity only to the total density perturbations, with the
two components being individually unobservable. We show that the clustering of
quintessence perturbations induces small corrections with respect to the
nonlinear evolution of power spectrum in smooth quintessence models described
by the same equation of state. Such small corrections, however, contrast with
the large effect of a vanishing speed of sound on the linear growth function at
low redshift. For this reason, models with the same normalization of the linear
density power spectrum can present significantly different nonlinear
corrections depending on the value of the sound speed. Although such
differences vanish in the w \rightarrow -1, {\Lambda}CDM limit, we argue that
the relation between linear and nonlinear growth of structures should be
properly taken into account in constraining models with inhomogeneous dark
energy.

system of a few hard core (HC) bosons (N=8 and N=40) trapped inside a combined
harmonic optical cubic lattice (CHOCL) at T=0 K. The condensate fraction (CF)
is computed for individual lattice wells by separating the one-body density
matrix (OBDM) of the whole system into components at the various lattice sites.
Then each ""lattice-site"" component is diagonalized to find its eigenvalues. The
eigenvalues are obtained by a method presented earlier [Dubois and Glyde, Phys.
Rev. A {\bf 63}, 023602 (2001)]. The effects of interference between the
condensates in the lattice wells on the CF in one well is also investigated.
The SF fraction (SFF) is calculated for N=40 by using the diffusion formula of
Pollock and Ceperley [Pollock and Ceperley, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 36}, 8343
(1987)]. Our chief result is an opposing behavior of the global CF and SFF with
increasing lattice wave vector $k$. In addition, the CF in a lattice well is
enhanced by the interference with its neighbor wells beyond the result when the
interference is neglected. The global SF is depleted with a rise of the
repulsion between the bosons, yet at very strong interaction superfluidity is
still present. The global CF remains almost constant with increasing HC
repulsion. A reduction in the lattice dimension, i.e. an increase in the
lattice wave vector, increases the local CF in each lattice well, but reduces
the corresponding local SFF. At large HC repulsion, a coexisting SF-(vacuum)MI
phase is established.

interactions of finite state machines in complex systems are well captured by

collections of finite state machines that interact concurrently through a
communication network. We propose a notion of compositional bisimulation that
allows checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs by directly exploiting their

complexity reduction when checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs, as

(MAMBO) array on the IRAM 30 m telescope. After filtering, our full map has an
RMS sensitivity ranging from 0.45 to 1.5 mJy/beam, with an average of 0.75
mJy/beam. Using the pixel flux distribution in a map made from our best data,
we determine the shape, normalization, and approximate flux density cutoff for
1.2 mm number counts well below our nominal sensitivity and confusion limits.
After validating our full dataset through comparison with this map, we
successfully detect 41 1.2 mm sources with S/N > 4.0 and S(1.2 mm)\simeq 2-5

have 20 cm counterparts, 49% have Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron counterparts, and one
may have a significant Chandra X-ray counterpart. We resolve \simeq 3% of the
cosmic infrared background (CIB) at 1.2 mm into significant detections, and
directly estimate a 0.05 mJy faint-end cutoff for the counts that is consistent
with the full intensity of the 1.2 mm CIB. The median redshift of our 17

present a information-theoretic approach to classification of user activity on
Twitter. We focus on tweets that contain embedded URLs and study their
collective `retweeting' dynamics. We identify two features, time-interval and
user entropy, which we use to classify retweeting activity. We achieve good
separation of different activities using just these two features and are able
to categorize content based on the collective user response it generates.
  We have identified five distinct categories of retweeting activity on
Twitter: automatic/robotic activity, newsworthy information dissemination,
advertising and promotion, campaigns, and parasitic advertisement. In the
course of our investigations, we have shown how Twitter can be exploited for
promotional and spam-like activities. The content-independent, entropy-based
activity classification method is computationally efficient, scalable and
robust to sampling and missing data. It has many applications, including
automatic spam-detection, trend identification, trust management,

energy which can be viewed as a coupling between the magnetic induction and the

from a monodisperse distribution to a polydisperse one in the subcritical

analytically that $H$ diverges algebraically approaching the percolation

$\sigma$ associated with the characteristic cluster size. Interestingly, its
finite-size-scaling behavior is governed by a new exponent $\nu_H =

usual spin drift-diffusion equations. In particular, we demonstrate that in
infinite 1D wires with Rashba spin-orbit interaction the exponential spin
relaxation decay can be modulated by an oscillating function. In the case of
spin relaxation in finite length 1D wires, it is shown that an initially
homogeneous spin polarization spontaneously transforms into a persistent spin
helix. An interesting sound waves echo-like behavior of initially localized
spin polarization packet is found in finite length wires. We show that a
propagating spin polarization profile reflects from a system boundary and
returns back to its initial position similarly to the reflectance of sound
waves from an obstacle. Green's function of spin kinetic equation is found for
both finite and infinite 1D systems. Moreover, we demonstrate explicitly that
the spin relaxation in 2D channels with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
interactions of equal strength occurs similarly to that in 1D wires of finite
length. Finally, a simple transformation mapping 1D spin kinetic equation into
the Klein-Gordon equation with an imaginary mass is found thus establishing an

transfer, and our potential model results in a ring radius of ~200 pc, which
coincides with the extraordinary reservoir of dense molecular clouds in the
inner bulge, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). The gas clouds accumulated in
the CMZ can reach high enough densities to form stars, and with an appropriate
choice of simulation parameters, we successfully reproduce the observed gas
mass and the star formation rate (SFR) in the CMZ, ~2x10^7 Msun and ~0.1
Msun/yr. Star formation in our simulations takes place mostly in the outermost
X2 orbits, and the SFR per unit surface area outside the CMZ is much lower.
These facts suggest that the inner Galactic bulge may harbor a mild version of
the nuclear star-forming rings seen in some external disk galaxies.
Furthermore, from the relatively small size of the Milky Way's nuclear bulge,
which is thought to be a result of sustained star formation in the CMZ, we
infer that the Galactic inner bulge probably had a shallower density profile or
stronger bar elongation in the past.

spectra during the eclipse, out-of-eclipse, and dips are found to be well
described by a partial covering power-law model with high energy cut-off and
three Gaussian functions for 6.4 keV, 6.7 keV, and 6.97 keV iron emission
lines. The dips in the light curve can be explained by the presence of an
additional absorption component with high column density and covering fraction,
the values of which are not significant during the rest of the orbital phases.
The iron line parameters during the dips and eclipse are significantly
different compared to those during the rest of the observation. During the
dips, the iron line intensities are found to be lesser by a factor of 2--3 with
significant increase in the line equivalent widths. However, the continuum flux
at the corresponding orbital phase is estimated to be lesser by more than an
order of magnitude. Similarities in the changes in the iron line flux and

sources were detected in the XIS field of view (FOV) except for two faint
point-like sources. The two sources, however, are considered not to be related
to HESS J1702-420, because their fluxes in the 2-10 keV band (~ 10^-14 erg s^-1
cm^-2) are ~ 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the VHE gamma-ray flux in the
1-10 TeV band (F_{TeV} = 3.1 x 10^-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2). We compared the energy
spectrum of diffuse emission, extracted from the entire XIS FOV with those from
nearby observations. If we consider the systematic error of background
subtraction, no significant diffuse emission was detected with an upper limit
of F_X <2.7 x 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 in the 2-10 keV band for an assumed
power-law spectrum of \Gamma=2.1 and a source size same as that in the VHE
band. The upper limit of the X-ray flux is twelve times as small as the VHE
gamma-ray flux. The large flux ratio (F_{TeV}/F_X) indicates that HESS
J1702-420 is another example of a ""dark"" particle accelerator. If we use a
simple one-zone leptonic model, in which VHE gamma-rays are produced through
inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background and interstellar
far-infrared emission, and the X-rays via the synchrotron mechanism, an upper
limit of the magnetic field (1.7 \mu G) is obtained from the flux ratio.
Because the magnetic field is weaker than the typical value in the Galactic
plane (3-10 \mu G), the simple one-zone model may not work for HESS J1702-420
and a significant fraction of the VHE gamma-rays may originate from protons.

susceptible of verification or contradiction. To that end it is useful to
introduce a kind of coordinates, that we call quasi-Minkowskian coordinates
(QMC), as an empirical extension of the Minkowskian coordinates employed by the
inertial observers in flat space-time to general observers in the curved
situations in presence of gravitation. The QMC are operationally defined by
some of the operational protocols through which the inertial observers
determine their Minkowskian coordinates and may be mathematically characterized
in a neighbourhood of the world-line of the corresponding observer. It is taken
care of the fact that the set of all the operational protocols which are
equivalent to measure a quantity in flat space-time split into inequivalent
subsets of operational prescriptions under the presence of a gravitational
field or when the observer is not inertial. We deal with the Hole Argument by
resorting to de idea of the QMC and show how it is the metric field that
supplies the physical meaning of coordinates and individuates point-events in
regions of space-time where no other fields exist. Because of that the GCP has
also value as a guiding principle supporting Einstein's appreciation of its

precisely, its ratio to the Z-mass) utilizes the distributions of three
variables in events where the W decays into an electron or a muon: the
charged-lepton transverse momentum, the missing transverse energy and the
transverse mass of the lepton pair. We study the putative advantages of the
additional measurement of a fourth variable: an improved phase-space
singularity mass. This variable is statistically optimal, and simultaneously
exploits the longitudinal- and transverse-momentum distributions of the charged
lepton. Though the process we discuss is one of the simplest realistic ones
involving just one unobservable particle, it is fairly non-trivial and
constitutes a good ""training"" example for the scrutiny of phenomena involving
invisible objects. Our graphical analysis of the phase space is akin to that of
a Dalitz plot, extended to such processes.

around quantum criticality, where critical exponents reflect the nature of
emergent excitations. In particular, novel symmetries can emerge from strong
interactions, expected to be responsible for quantum number fractionalization.
The underlying mechanism has been proposed that an emergent enhanced symmetry
allows a topological term associated with anomaly, which assigns a fermion's
quantum number to a topological excitation, referred as the Goldstone-Wilczek
current. Although this mechanism has been verified in one dimensional
interacting electrons, where either spinons or holons are identified with
topological solitons, its generalization to higher dimensions is beyond the
field theoretic framework in the respect that interplay between interaction and
anomaly cannot be taken into account sincerely within the field theory
technique above one dimension. In this study we examine the interplay between
correlations and topological terms based on the holographic approach, allowing
us to incorporate such nonperturbative quantum effects via solving classical
equations of motion but on a curved space. We solve the
Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on the Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS$_5$ in the
extremal limit, and uncover novel critical exponents to appear in the
current-current correlation functions, where both the emergent locality and the
Chern-Simons term play an important role in such critical exponents. We
speculate that the corresponding conformal field theory may result from
interacting U(1) currents with chiral anomaly at finite density, expected to be
applicable to topological insulators with strong interactions, where dyon-type
excitations appear to carry nontrivial fermion's quantum numbers.

of state estimation for a pre- and post-selected ensemble. The problem has
fundamental physical significance since, as argued by Y. Aharonov and
collaborators, pre- and post-selected ensembles are the most basic quantum
ensembles. Two new features are shown to appear: 1) information is flowing to
the measuring device both from the past and from the future; 2)because of the
post-selection, certain measurement outcomes can be forced never to occur. Due
to these features, state estimation in such ensembles is dramatically different
from the case of ordinary, pre-selected only ensembles. Here we develop a
general theoretical framework for studying this problem, and illustrate it
through several examples. We also prove a general theorem showing that
information flowing from the future is related to the complex conjugate
information flowing from the past. We emphasize that all state estimation
problems can be extended to the pre- and post-selected situation. The present
work thus lays the foundations of a much more general theory of quantum state
estimation.

especially useful for planets with eccentricity larger than the disk aspect
ratio. We make use of the dynamical friction formula to calculate the force
exerted on the planet by the disk, and the force is averaged over the period of
the planet. The resulting migration and eccentricity damping timescale agrees
very well with the previous works in which the planet eccentricity is
moderately larger than the disk aspect ratio. The advantage of this approach is
that it is possible to apply this formulation to arbitrary large eccentricity.
We have found that the timescale of the orbital evolution depends largely on
the adopted disk model in the case of highly eccentric planets. We discuss the
possible implication of our results to the theory of planet formation.

obtained by the CoRoT satellite that show the presence of five independent
oscillation frequencies in the range 3.6-5 c/d. Using spectra acquired with
FLAMES@VLT, we derive the following stellar parameters: spectral type F1V,
T$_{\rm eff}$=7000$\pm$200 K, log(g)=$3.8\pm0.4$, [M/H]=$-1.1\pm0.2$,
$v$sin$i$=$50\pm5$ km/s, L/L$_{\odot}$=21$^{+21}_{-11}$. Thus, for the first
time we report the existence of a metal poor, intermediate-mass PMS pulsating
star. Ground-based and satellite data are used to derive the spectral energy
distribution of CoRoT\,102699796 extending from the optical to mid-infrared
wavelengths. The SED shows a significant IR excess at wavelengths greater than
$\sim5 \mu$. We conclude that CoRoT\,102699796 is a young Herbig Ae (F1Ve) star
with a transitional disk, likely associated to the HII region [FT96]213.1-2.2.
  The pulsation frequencies have been interpreted in the light of the
non-radial pulsation theory, using the LOSC code in conjunction with static and
rotational evolutionary tracks. A minimization algorithm was used to find the
best-fit model with M=1.84 M$_{\odot}$, T$_{\rm eff}$=6900 K which imply an
isochronal age of t$\sim$2.5 Myr. This result is based on the interpretation of
the detected frequencies as $g$-modes of low-moderate $n$-value. To our
knowledge, this is the first time that such modes are identified in a
intermediate-mass PMS pulsating star. Since CoRoT\,102699796 lies in the region
of the HR diagram where the $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor instability strips
intersect, we argue that the observed pulsation characteristics are
intermediate between these classes of variables, i.e. CoRoT\,102699796 is
likely the first PMS hybrid $\gamma$ Dor-$\delta$ Sct pulsator ever studied.

determined entirely from theory using an approach based on Cauchy's theorem in
the complex squared energy s-plane. This is possible after fitting the
integration kernel in $a_{\mu}^{HAD}$ with a simpler function of $s$. The
integral determining $a_{\mu}^{HAD}$ in the light-quark region is then split
into a low energy and a high energy part, the latter given by perturbative QCD
(PQCD). The low energy integral involving the fit function to the integration
kernel is determined by derivatives of the vector correlator at the origin,
plus a contour integral around a circle calculable in PQCD. These derivatives
are calculated using hadronic models in the light-quark sector. A similar
procedure is used in the heavy-quark sector, except that now everything is
calculable in PQCD, thus becoming the first entirely theoretical calculation of
this contribution. Using the dual resonance model realization of Large $N_{c}$
QCD to compute the derivatives of the correlator leads to agreement with the
experimental value of $a_\mu$. Accuracy, though, is currently limited by the
model dependent calculation of derivatives of the vector correlator at the
origin. Future improvements should come from more accurate chiral perturbation
theory and/or lattice QCD information on these derivatives, allowing for this
method to be used to determine $a_{\mu}^{HAD}$ accurately entirely from theory,
independently of any hadronic model.

for any $\eps > 0$, the author and Rudra (2006,08) presented an $n^{O(1/\eps)}$
time algorithm to list decode appropriate folded RS codes of rate $R$ from a
fraction $1-R-\eps$ of errors. The algorithm is based on multivariate
polynomial interpolation and root-finding over extension fields. It was noted
by Vadhan that interpolating a linear polynomial suffices if one settles for a
smaller decoding radius (but still enough for a statement of the above form).
Here we give a simple linear-algebra based analysis of this variant that
eliminates the need for the computationally expensive root-finding step over
extension fields (and indeed any mention of extension fields). The entire list
decoding algorithm is linear-algebraic, solving one linear system for the
interpolation step, and another linear system to find a small subspace of
candidate solutions. Except for the step of pruning this subspace, the
algorithm can be implemented to run in {\em quadratic} time. The theoretical
drawback of folded RS codes are that both the decoding complexity and proven
worst-case list-size bound are $n^{\Omega(1/\eps)}$. By combining the above
idea with a pseudorandom subset of all polynomials as messages, we get a Monte
Carlo construction achieving a list size bound of $O(1/\eps^2)$ which is quite
close to the existential $O(1/\eps)$ bound (however, the decoding complexity
remains $n^{\Omega(1/\eps)}$). Our work highlights that constructing an
explicit {\em subspace-evasive} subset that has small intersection with
low-dimensional subspaces could lead to explicit codes with better
list-decoding guarantees.

Malik",,,,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cosmological perturbation theory is crucial for our understanding of the
universe. The linear theory has been well understood for some time, however
developing and applying the theory beyond linear order is currently at the
forefront of research in theoretical cosmology. This thesis studies the
applications of perturbation theory to cosmology and, specifically, to the
early universe. Starting with some background material introducing the
well-tested 'standard model' of cosmology, we move on to develop the formalism
for perturbation theory up to second order giving evolution equations for all
types of scalar, vector and tensor perturbations, both in gauge dependent and
gauge invariant form. We then move on to the main result of the thesis, showing
that, at second order in perturbation theory, vorticity is sourced by a
coupling term quadratic in energy density and entropy perturbations. This
source term implies a qualitative difference to linear order. Thus, while at
linear order vorticity decays with the expansion of the universe, the same is
not true at higher orders. This will have important implications on future
measurements of the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and could
give rise to the generation of a primordial seed magnetic field. Having derived
this qualitative result, we then estimate the scale dependence and magnitude of
the vorticity power spectrum, finding, for simple power law inputs a small,
blue spectrum. The final part of this thesis concerns higher order perturbation
theory, deriving, for the first time, the metric tensor, gauge transformation
rules and governing equations for fully general third order perturbations. We
close with a discussion of natural extensions to this work and other possible
ideas for off-shooting projects in this continually growing field.

system to enable the programmer to express programs that reveal their true data
dependences when executed. We prove that the MFL language is sound by showing
that that MFL programs yield the same result as they would with respect to a

state. For experimentally accessible system parameters, unbound merons condense
in the ground state at magnetic fields as low as $B^* = 0.2$ T and for as few

corresponds to four orthogonal merons $\ket{QC}$ characterized by their
topological chirality $C$ and charge $Q$. This degeneracy is lifted by the
Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, which we include perturbatively,
yielding spectroscopic accessibility to individual merons. We further derive a
closed-form expression for the topological chirality in the form of a chiral
spin current and use it to both characterize our states and predict the
existence of other topological textures in other regions of phase space, for
example, at N=5. Finally, we compare the spin textures of our numerically exact
meron states to ansatz wave-functions of merons in quantum Hall droplets and
find that the ansatz qualitatively describes the meron states.

migration in microgravity is presented. Finite-difference methods were adopted
and the interfaces of drops were captured by the front-tracking technique. It
is found that the arrangement of drops directly influences their migrations and
interaction, and that the motion of one drop is mainly determined by the
disturbed temperature field because of the existence of the other drop.

In chapter one we give the basics needed to
make this book a self contained one. Chapter two introduces the notion of
interval semigroups and interval semifields and are algebraically analysed.
Chapter three introduces special types of interval semirings like matrix
interval semirings and interval polynomial semirings. Chapter four for the
first time introduces the notion of group interval semirings, semigroup
interval semirings, loop interval semirings and groupoid interval semirings and
these structures are studied. Interval neutrosophic semirings are introduced in
chapter five. Applications of these structures are given in chapter six. The
final chapter suggests around 120 problems for the reader.

consumption during scan based test. The transitions at some scan cells cause
more toggles at the internal signal lines of a circuit than the transitions at
other scan cells. Hence the transitions at these scan cells have a larger
impact on the power consumption during test application. These scan cells are
called power sensitive scan cells.A verilog based approach is proposed to
identify a set of power sensitive scan cells. Additional hardware is added to
freeze the outputs of power sensitive scan cells during scan shifting in order
to reduce the shift power consumption.when multiple scan chain is incorporated
along with freezing the power sensitive scan cell,over all power during testing
can be reduced to a larger extend.
