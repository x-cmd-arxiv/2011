follicles. The concentration of AMH in blood may also reflect the non-growing
follicle (NGF) population, i.e. the ovarian reserve, and be of value in
predicting reproductive lifespan. A full description of AMH production up to
the menopause has not been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: By
searching the published literature for AMH concentrations in healthy
pre-menopausal females, and using our own data (combined n = 3,260) we have
generated and robustly validated the first model of AMH concentration from
conception to menopause. This model shows that 34% of the variation in AMH is
due to age alone. We have shown that AMH peaks at age 24.5 years, followed by a
decline to the menopause. We have also shown that there is a neonatal peak and
a potential pre-pubertal peak. Our model allows us to generate normative data
at all ages. Conclusions/Significance: These data highlight key inflection
points in ovarian follicle dynamics. This first validated model of circulating
AMH in healthy females describes a transition period in early adulthood, after
which AMH reflects the progressive loss of the NGF pool. The existence of a
neonatal increase in gonadal activity is confirmed for females. An improved
understanding of the relationship between circulating AMH and age will lead
more accurate assessment of ovarian reserve for the individual woman.

established before birth that decline with increasing age culminating in the
menopause at 50-51 years. The objective of this study is to model the
age-related population of NGFs in the human ovary from conception to menopause.
Data were taken from eight separate quantitative histological studies (n = 325)
in which NGF populations at known ages from seven weeks post conception to 51
years (median 32 years) were calculated. The data set was fitted to 20 peak
function models, with the results ranked by obtained r2 correlation
coefficient. The highest ranked model was chosen. Our model matches the
log-adjusted NGF population from conception to menopause to a five-parameter
asymmetric double Gaussian cumulative (ADC) curve (r2 = 0.81). When restricted
to ages up to 25 years, the ADC curve has r2 = 0.95. We estimate that for 95%
of women by the age of 30 years only 12% of their maximum pre-birth NGF
population is present and by the age of 40 years only 3% remains. Furthermore,
we found that the rate of NGF recruitment towards maturation for most women
increases from birth until approximately age 14 years then decreases towards
the menopause. To our knowledge, this is the first model of ovarian reserve
from conception to menopause. This model allows us to estimate the number of
NGFs present in the ovary at any given age, suggests that 81% of the variance
in NGF populations is due to age alone, and shows for the first time, to our
knowledge, that the rate of NGF recruitment increases from birth to age 14
years then declines with age until menopause. An increased understanding of the
dynamics of human ovarian reserve will provide a more scientfic basis for
fertility counselling for both healthy women and those who have survived
gonadotoxic cancer treatments.

derivation $D=(\Id,D_1=\delta,D_2,...,D_m)$ of $A$ over $k$ of length $m$. This

We develop a method to directly compare energy spectra for ultra-high energy
cosmic rays from two different regions of the sky in the same experiment
without reliance on agreement with a theoretical model of the energy spectra.
The consistency between the two spectra is expressed in terms of a Bayes
factor, defined here as the ratio of the likelihood of the two-parent source
hypothesis to the likelihood of the one-parent source hypothesis. Unlike other
methods, for example chi^2 tests, the Bayes factor allows for the calculation
of the posterior odds ratio and correctly accounts for non-Gaussian
uncertainties. The latter is particularly important at the highest energies,
where the number of events is very small.

In the semi-relativistic Pauli-Fierz model our exponential decay rate given in

when the radiation field is turned off. In particular, an increase of the
binding energy due to the radiation field is shown to improve the localization

supply, demand, and clearing prices in power system with real-time retail
pricing and information asymmetry. Real-time retail pricing is characterized by
passing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, and
is shown to create a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and
the market layer of the power system. In the absence of a carefully designed
control law, such direct feedback between the two layers could increase
volatility and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and
generation. A new notion of generalized price-elasticity is introduced, and it
is shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's
maximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the
generalized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this
ratio increases, the system becomes more volatile, and eventually, unstable. As
new demand response technologies and distributed storage increase the
price-elasticity of demand, the architecture under examination is likely to
lead to increased volatility and possibly instability. This highlights the need
for assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally
strike the trade-offs between volatility, economic efficiency, and system
reliability.

published eclipse times and archival data spanning ~27 years, we detect
departures from a linear and quadratic trend of ~60 s. The departures are
strongly suggestive of two cyclic variations of 16(3) and 5.25(25) years. The
two favoured mechanisms to drive the periodicities are either two giant
extrasolar planets as companions to the binary (with minimum masses of
6.3(1.5)M(Jupiter) and 7.7(1.2)M(Jupiter)) or a magnetic cycle mechanism (e.g.
Applegate's mechanism) of the secondary star. Applegate's mechanism would
require the entire radiant energy output of the secondary and would therefore
seem to be the least likely of the two, barring any further refinements in the
effect of magnetic fieilds (e.g. those of Lanza et al.). The two planet model
can provide realistic solutions but it does not quite capture all of the
eclipse times measurements. A highly eccentric orbit for the outer planet would
fit the data nicely, but we find that such a solution would be unstable. It is
also possible that the periodicities are driven by some combination of both

Europa's atmosphere with STIS in 1999 of Europa's trailing side show an
enigmatic surplus of radiation on the anti-Jovian side within the disk of
Europa. With emission from a radially symmetric atmosphere as a reference, we
searched for an anti-Jovian vs sub-Jovian asymmetry with respect to the central
meridian on the leading side, and found none. Likewise, we searched for
departures from a radially symmetric atmospheric emission and found an emission
surplus centered around 90 degree west longitude, for which plausible
mechanisms exist. Previous work about the possibility of plumes on Europa due
to tidally-driven shear heating found longitudes with strongest local strain
rates which might be consistent with the longitudes of maximum UV emissions.
Alternatively, asymmetries in Europa's UV emission can also be caused by
inhomogeneous surface properties, inhomogeneous solar illuminations, and/or by
Europa's complex plasma interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere.

which suggests that the strong coupling \alpha_s(Q) freezes at low Q, and by
similarities between the spectra of hadrons and atoms, I discuss if and how QCD
bound states may be treated perturbatively. I recall the basic principles of
perturbative gauge theory bound states at lowest order in the \hbar expansion.
Born level amplitudes are insensitive to the i\epsilon prescription of
propagators, which allows to eliminate the Z-diagrams of relativistic,
time-ordered Coulomb interactions. The Dirac wave function thus describes a
single electron which propagates forward in time only, even though the bound
state has any number of pair constituents when Feynman propagators are used. In
the absence of an external potential, states that are bound by the Coulomb
attraction of their constituents can be analogously described using only their
valence degrees of freedom. The instantaneous A^0 field is determined by Gauss'
law for each wave function component, i.e., for each position of the valence
constituents. Solutions for A^0 obtained with a boundary condition that imposes
an asymptotically constant energy density give rise to a linear potential for
color singlet q\bar q and qqq states. The strength of the linear potential is
determined by the boundary condition and is of lower order in \alpha_s than the
gluon exchange interaction, which may then be treated as a higher order
perturbative correction. Bound states evaluated to a given order in \alpha_s
and \hbar must have the full symmetry of the exact theory, including the
dynamic boost invariance of states quantized at equal time. The wave functions
are indeed found to have such a hidden invariance, which ensures the correct
dependence of the energy eigenvalues on the center of mass momentum. Thus
relativistic bound states can be studied using perturbative methods.

relative time delay between the detection of photoelectrons from different
initial electronic states. This relative delay is obtained by recording the
photoelectron yield as a function of the delay between an ionizing ultrashort
extended ultraviolet (XUV) pulse and a streaking infrared (IR) pulse.
Theoretically, photoemission delays can be defined based on i) the phase shift
the photoelectron wavefunction accumulates during the release and propagation
of the photoelectron (``Wigner delay"") and, alternatively, ii) the streaking
trace in the calculated photoemission spectrum (``streaking delay""). We
investigate the relation between Wigner and streaking delays in the
photoemission from atomic and solid-surface targets. For solid targets and
assuming a vanishing IR-skin depth, both Wigner and streaking delays can be
interpreted as an average propagation time needed by photoelectrons to reach
the surface, while the two delays differ for non-vanishing skin depths. For
atomic targets, the difference between Wigner and streaking delays depends on
the range of the ionic potential.

traditional horizon and flatness problems of big bang cosmology and predicts a
scale invariant spectrum of perturbations. Unlike inflation, this scenario
requires no exponential accelerated expansion of space-time. Instead, the early
universe is described by a conformal field theory minimally coupled to gravity.
The conformal fields develop a time-dependent expectation value which breaks
the flat space so(4,2) conformal symmetry down to so(4,1), the symmetries of de
Sitter, giving perturbations a scale invariant spectrum. The solution is an
attractor, at least in the case of a single time-dependent field. Meanwhile,
the metric background remains approximately flat but slowly contracts, which
makes the universe increasingly flat, homogeneous and isotropic, akin to the
smoothing mechanism of ekpyrotic cosmology. Our scenario is very general,
requiring only a conformal field theory capable of developing the appropriate
time-dependent expectation values, and encompasses existing incarnations of
this idea, specifically the U(1) model of Rubakov and the Galileon Genesis
scenario. Its essential features depend only on the symmetry breaking pattern
and not on the details of the underlying lagrangian. It makes generic
observational predictions that make it potentially distinguishable from
standard inflation, in particular significant non-gaussianities and the absence
of primordial gravitational waves.

tidal disruption of a star by a central supermassive black hole. In theoretical
treatments of this process it is usually assumed that the star was initially on
a nearly parabolic orbit relative to the black hole. Such an assumption leads
in the simplest approximation to a $t^{-5/3}$ decay of the bolometric
luminosity and this is indeed consistent with the relatively poorly sampled
light curves of such flares. We point out that there is another regime in which
the decay would be different: if a binary is tidally separated and the star
that remains close to the hole is eventually tidally disrupted from a moderate
eccentricity orbit, the decay is slower, typically $\sim t^{-1.2}$. As a
result, careful sampling of the light curves of such flares could distinguish
between these processes and yield insight into the dynamics of binaries as well
as single stars in galactic centres. We explore this process using three-body
simulations and analytic treatments and discuss the consequences for
present-day X-ray detections and future gravitational wave observations.

observations, we measure the density of 51 detected H2CO line pairs and present
upper limits on density for an additional 24 detected 1-1 lines. We analyze the
systematic uncertainties in the H2CO densitometer, achieving H2 density
measurements with accuracies ~ 0.1-0.3 dex. The densities measured are not
correlated with distance, implying that it is possible to make accurate density
measurements throughout the galaxy without a distance bias. We confirm that
ultracompact HII regions are associated with gas at densities n(H2)~10^5cm^-3.
The densities measured in line-of-sight molecular clouds suggest that they
consist of low volume filling factor (f~10^-2) gas at high (n(H2)>10^4cm^-3)
density, which is inconsistent with purely supersonic turbulence and requires
high-density clumping greater than typically observed in gravoturbulent
simulations. We observe complex line morphologies that indicate density
variations with velocity around UCHII regions, and we classify a subset of the
UCHII molecular envelopes as collapsing or expanding. We compare these
measurements to Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey 1.1mm observations, and note that
most UCHII regions have 1.1mm emission consisting of significant (5-70%)
free-free emission and are therefore not necessarily dominated by optically
thin dust emission. A comparison of our data with the Mangum et al. starburst
sample shows that the area filling factor of dense (n(H2)~10^5cm^-3) molecular
gas in typical starburst galaxies is <~0.01, but in extreme starburst galaxies
like Arp 220, is ~0.1, suggesting that Arp 220 is physically similar to an
oversized UCHII region.

tracer, it is likely to be a poor mass tracer because of sub-thermal line
excitation and high opacity, which may also contribute to the outflow mass
discrepancy. It is unlikely that outflows could provide the observed turbulent
energy in the W5 molecular clouds even accounting for undetected outflow
material. Many cometary globules have been observed with velocity gradients

LL theory must therefore take these corrections into account. As an important
example, we re-examine the proposed metallic phase of the zero-temperature,
half-filled one-dimensional Holstein model without employing the LL relations.
In particular, using quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we study the competition
between the singlet pairing and charge ordering. Our results do not support the
existence of a dominant singlet pairing state.

N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, which include detailed chemical evolution,
cooling, star formation, feedback effects and the transition between PopIII and
more standard population I/II (PopII/I) stars. From the Swift observed rate of
LGRBs, we estimate the fraction of black holes that will produce a GRB from
PopII/I stars to be in the range 0.028<f_{GRB}<0.140, depending on the assumed
upper metallicity of the progenitor. Assuming that as of today no GRB event has
been associated to a PopIII star, we estimate the upper limit for the fraction
of LGRBs produced by PopIII stars to be in the range 0.006<f_{GRB}<0.022. When
we apply a detection threshold compatible with the BAT instrument, we find that
the expected fraction of PopIII GRBs (GRB3) is ~10% of the full LGRB population
at z>6, becoming as high has 40% at z>10. Finally, we study the properties of
the galaxies hosting our sample of GRB3. We find that the average metallicity
of the galaxies hosting a GRB3 is typically higher than the critical
metallicity used to select the PopIII stars, due to the efficiency in polluting
the gas above such low values. We also find that the highest probability of
finding a GRB3 is within galaxies with a stellar mass <10^7 Msun, independently

total density profiles of distant clusters of galaxies. Unfortunately, it
suffers from the well-known mass-sheet degeneracy, so that weak lensing
analyses cannot lead to fully reliable determinations of the total mass of the
clusters. One possible way to set the relevant scale of the density profile
would be to make a direct measurement of the magnification produced by the
clusters as gravitational lenses. In this paper we revisit a suggestion made a
few years ago for this general purpose, based on the use of the Fundamental
Plane as a standard rod for early-type galaxies. Here we move one step further,
beyond the simple outline of the idea given earlier, and quantify some
statistical properties of this innovative diagnostic tool, with the final goal
of identifying clear guidelines for a future observational test on concrete
cases, which turns out to be well within the current instrument capabilities.
The study is carried out by discussing the statistical properties of
Fundamental Plane measurements for a sample of early-type source galaxies
behind a massive cluster, for which a weak lensing analysis is assumed to be
available. We proceed to study the best strategy to use Fundamental Plane
measurements to determine the mass scale of a given cluster and find that the
optimal choice is that of a sample of early-type galaxies behind the cluster
distributed approximately uniformly in the sky. We also show that substructures
do not contribute much to the magnification signal that we are looking for, but
only add a modest amount of scatter. We find that for a massive cluster (M >
10^15 M_Sun) located at redshift 0.3 +/- 0.1, a set of about 20 Fundamental
Plane measurements, combined with a good weak lensing analysis, should be able
to lead to a mass determination with a precision of 20% or better.

of which have hard X-ray spectral slopes (Gamma<1) indicating the presence of
heavily obscured AGN activity. The other 36 X-ray detected BzK galaxies appear
to be relatively unobscured AGNs and starburst galaxies; we use X-ray
variability analyses over a rest-frame baseline of ~3 years to further confirm
the presence of AGN activity in many of these systems. The majority (7 out of
11) of the heavily obscured AGNs have excess IR emission over that expected
from star formation (termed ""IR-excess galaxies""). However, we find that X-ray
detected heavily obscured AGNs only comprise ~25% of the IR-excess galaxy
population, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured AGNs and
starburst galaxies. We find that the typical X-ray spectrum of the heavily
obscured AGNs is better characterized by a pure reflection model than an
absorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme Compton-thick absorption in some
systems. We verify this result by producing a composite rest-frame 2-20 keV
spectrum, which has a similar shape as a reflection-dominated X-ray spectrum
and reveals an emission feature at rest-frame energy ~6.4 keV, likely to be due
to Fe K. These heavily obscured AGNs are likely to be the distant analogs of
the reflection-dominated AGNs recently identified at z~0 with >10 keV
observatories. On the basis of these analyses we estimate the space density for
typical (intrinsic X-ray luminosities of L_X>1E43 erg/s) heavily obscured and
Compton-thick AGNs at z~2. Our space-density constraints are conservative lower
limits but they are already consistent with the range of predictions from X-ray

Hubble's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We confirm that galactic superwind
outflows are required to enrich the IGM to observed levels down to z=0 using
three wind prescriptions contrasted to a no-wind simulation. Our favoured
momentum-conserved wind prescription deposits metals closer to galaxies owing
to its moderate energy input, while the more energetic constant wind model
enriches the warm-hot IGM 6.4x more. Despite these significant differences, all
wind models produce metal-line statistics within a factor of two of existing
observations. This is because OVI, CIV, SiIV, and NeVIII absorbers primarily
arise from T<10^5 K, photo-ionised gas that is enriched to similar levels in
the three feedback schemes. OVI absorbers trace the diffuse phase with
delta<100, which is enriched to ~1/50 Zsol at z=0, although the absorbers
themselves usually exceed 0.3 Zsol and arise from inhomogeneously distributed,
un-mixed winds. CIV and SiIV absorbers trace primarily T~10^4 K gas inside
haloes. We predict COS will observe a population of NeVIII photo-ionised
absorbers tracing T<10^5 K, delta~10 gas. MgX and SiXII are rarely detected in
COS S/N=30 simulated sight lines although detections trace T=10^(6-7) K halo
gas. In general, the IGM is enriched in an outside-in manner, where wind-blown
metals released at higher redshift reach lower overdensities, resulting in
higher ionisation species tracing lower-density, older metals. At z=0, the 90%
of baryons outside of galaxies are enriched to 0.096 Zsol, but the 65% of
unbound baryons in the IGM have 0.018 Zsol and contain only 4% of all metals.

electrons and ions. We compute the energy partition, the fractions $E_e/E_0$
and $E_\smI/E_0$ of the initial energy $E_0$ of this `impurity particle' that
are deposited into the electrons and ions when it has slowed down into an
equilibrium distribution that we shall determine. We use a well-defined
Fokker-Planck equation for the phase space distribution of the charged impurity
particles in a weakly to moderately coupled plasma. The Fokker-Planck equation
holds to first sub-leading order in the dimensionless plasma coupling constant,
which means we compute to order $n\ln n$ (leading) and $n$ (sub-leading) in the
plasma density $n$. Previously, the order $n$ terms had been estimated, not
calculated. Since the charged particle does not come to rest, the energy loss
obtained by an integration of a $dE/dx$ has an ambiguity of order of the plasma
temperature. Our Fokker-Planck formulation provides an unambiguous, precise
definition of the energy fractions. For equal electron and ion temperatures, we
find that our precise results agree well with a fit obtained by Fraley,
Linnebur, Mason, and Morse. The case with differing electron and ion
temperatures, a case of great importance for nuclear fusion, will be
investigated in detail in the present paper. The energy partitions for this
general case, partitions that have not been obtained before, will be presented.
We find that now the proper solution of the Fokker-Planck equation yields a
quasi-static equilibrium distribution to which fast particles relax that has
neither the electron nor the ion temperature. This ""schizophrenic"" final
ensemble of slowed particles gives a new mechanism to bring the electron and
ion temperatures together. The rate at which this new mechanism brings the
electrons and ions in the plasma into thermal equilibrium will be computed.

  June, 2011",,"10.1088/0004-6256/142/2/55",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Theoretical work suggests that a young star's angular momentum and rotation
rate may be strongly influenced by magnetic interactions with its circumstellar
disk. A generic prediction of these 'disk-locking' (DL) theories is that a
disk-locked star will be forced to co-rotate with the Keplerian angular
velocity of the inner edge of the disk. These theories have also been
interpreted to suggest a correlation between young stars' rotation periods and
the structural properties of their disks, such that slowly rotating stars
possess close-in disks that enforce the star's slow rotation, whereas rapidly
rotating stars possess anemic or evacuated inner disks that are unable to brake
the stars and they spin up as they contract. To test these expectations, we
model the SEDs of 33 young stars in IC 348 with known rotation periods and
infrared excesses indicating the presence of disks. For each star, we match the
observed spectral energy distribution, typically sampling 0.6-8.0 \mum, to a
grid of 200,000 pre-computed star+disk radiative transfer models, from which we
infer the disk's inner-truncation radius (R_trunc). We then compare this
R_trunc to the disk's co-rotation radius (R_co), calculated from the star's
rotation period. We do not find obvious differences in the disk R_trunc of slow
vs. rapid rotators. This holds true both at the level of whether close-in disk
material is present at all, and in analyzing the precise location of the inner
disk edge relative to the R_co amongst the subset of stars with close-in disk
material. One interpretation is that DL is unimportant for the IC 348 stars in
our sample. Alternatively, if DL does operate, then it must operate on both the
slow and rapid rotators, potentially producing both spin-up and spin-down
torques, and the transition from the disk-locked state to the disk-released
state must occur more rapidly than the stellar contraction timescale.

this is within an additive factor of the best known nonasymptotic bounds. For

locally decompose ambient hydrocarbons onto a bare Si (001) surface. These
carbonaceous patterns are annealed in UHV, forming ordered arrays of nanoscale
SiC precipitates that serve as templates for subsequent Ge quantum dot
self-assembly during heteroepitaxy. This templating approach has so far
produced interdot spacings down to 22.5 nm, and smaller spacings should be
possible. We investigate the templated feature evolution during UHV processing
to identify key mechanisms that must be controlled in order to preserve pattern
fidelity and reduce broadening of the quantum dot size distribution. A key
finding is that the presence of a small background of excess carbon reduces Ge
surface diffusion, thereby suppressing coarsening to relatively high
temperatures. In fact, coarsening of the carbonaceous nanodot template prior to
conversion to SiC can be a more important contributor to size dispersion, and
must be avoided through control of thermal budget.

Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO)
and the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope (SMART). During the rising
period, the shape of the jet resembled a cylinder with helical structures on
the surface, while the mass of the jet was mainly distributed on the cylinder's
shell. In the radial direction, the jet expanded successively at its western
side. The radial expansion presented three distinct phases: the gradually
expanding phase, the fast expanding phase, and the steady phase. Each phase
lasted for about 12 minutes. The angular speed of the unwinding jet and the
twist transferred into the outer corona during the eruption are estimated to be
11.1 \times 10{-3} rad/s (period = 564 s) and 1.17 to 2.55 turns (or 2.34 to

component of the magnetic field in the jet and comparing the free energy stored
in the non-potential magnetic field with the jet's total energy, we find that
the non-potential magnetic field in the jet is enough to supply the energy for
the ejection. These new observational results strongly support the scenario
that the jets are driven by the magnetic twist, which is stored in the twisted
closed field of a bipole, and released through magnetic reconnection between
the bipole and its ambient open field.

we employ the product measure, so that the global forms of governing equations
may be cast in forms involving conventional (integer-order) integrals, while
the local forms are expressed through partial differential equations with
derivatives of integer order but containing coefficients involving the
{\alpha}_{i}'s. First, a formulation based on product measures is shown to
satisfy the four basic identities of vector calculus. This allows a
generalization of the Green-Gauss and Stokes theorems as well as the charge
conservation equation on anisotropic fractals. Then, pursuing the conceptual
approach, we derive the Faraday and Amp\`ere laws for such fractal media,
which, along with two auxiliary null-divergence conditions, effectively give
the modified Maxwell equations. Proceeding on a separate track, we employ a
variational principle for electromagnetic fields, appropriately adapted to
fractal media, to independently derive the same forms of these two laws. It is
next found that the parabolic (for a conducting medium) and the hyperbolic (for
a dielectric medium) equations involve modified gradient operators, while the
Poynting vector has the same form as in the non-fractal case. Finally,
Maxwell's electromagnetic stress tensor is reformulated for fractal systems. In
all the cases, the derived equations for fractal media depend explicitly on

fragmentation functions in A+A collisions are suppressed relative to p+p,
photon-triggered heavy meson fragmentation functions can be either enhanced or

muon spin rotation/ relaxation measurements. Instead of a relationship for the
localized electron limit, one for itinerant electron systems between muon
depolarization rate and spin fluctuation rate ({\nu}_D) is employed to
re-analyze data, which reveals that {\nu}D varies linearly with temperature
({\nu}_D {\propto} T) over a range 10^8-10^{12} /s for 0.02 {\le} T < 102 K.
Such a linear-T behavior as well as the magnitude of {\nu}_D is fully
consistent with that of the magnetic relaxation rate previously observed by
inelastic neutron scattering (INS), demonstrating that {\mu}SR and INS have a
common time window over the fluctuation spectrum. The linear-T dependence of
{\nu}_D is understood as a specific feature predicted by a Hubbard model for
intersecting one-dimensional (1D) chains. This quasi-1D character, which is
co-existent with enhanced uniform susceptibility at low temperatures, supports
the scenario of 1D-to-3D crossover for the microscopic origin of heavy-fermion

called the m-Tamari lattice, which generalizes the usual Tamari lattice
obtained when m=1. We prove that the number of intervals in this lattice is $$
\frac {m+1}{n(mn+1)} {(m+1)^2 n+m\choose n-1}. $$ This formula was recently
conjectured by Bergeron in connection with the study of coinvariant spaces. The
case m=1 was proved a few years ago by Chapoton. Our proof is based on a
recursive description of intervals, which translates into a functional equation
satisfied by the associated generating function. The solution of this equation
is an algebraic series, obtained by a guess-and-check approach. Finding a
bijective proof remains an open problem.

epitaxial strain effect on the ferroelectric and magnetic properties of the
tetragonal BiFeO3, we find that there exists a transition from C-type to G-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at in-plane constant a ~ 3.905 {\AA} when the
ferroelectric polarization is along [001] direction. Such magnetic phase
transition can be explained by the competition between the Heisenberg exchange
constant J1c and J2c under the influence of biaxial strain. Interestingly, when
the in-plane lattice constant enlarges, the preferred ferroelectric
polarization tends to be canted and eventually lies in the plane (along [110]
direction). It is found that the orientation change of ferroelectric
polarization, which can be realized by applying external electric-field, has
significant impact on the Heisenberg exchange parameters and therefore the
magnetic orderings of tetragonal BiFeO3. For example, at a ~ 3.79 {\AA}, an
electric field along [111] direction with magnitude of 2 MV/cm could change the
magnetic ordering from C-AFM to G-AFM. As the magnetic ordering affects many
physical properties of the magnetic material, e.g. magnetoresistance, we expect
such strategy would provide a new avenue to the application of multiferroic
materials.

in the determination of basic physical properties. An equivalent issue with an
inconsistent value of the speed of light was resolved by adopting a nominal
value that is constant and has no error associated with it. Analogously, we
suggest that the systematic error in stellar parameters may be eliminated by:
(1) replacing the solar radius Rsun and luminosity Lsun by the nominal values
that are by definition exact and expressed in SI units: 1 RnomSun = 6.95508 x
10^8 m and 1 LnomSun = 3.846 x 10^{26} W; (2) computing stellar masses in terms
of Msun by noting that the measurement error of the product G.Msun is 5 orders
of magnitude smaller than the error in G; (3) computing stellar masses and
temperatures in SI units by using the derived values Msun(2010) = 1.988547 x
10^{30} kg and Tsun(2010) = 5779.57 K; and (4) clearly stating the reference

has revealed that these flare activities have been accompanied by structural
change of the prominent shock front traced by H2O maser alignments. We have
detected only blue-shifted emissions and all maser features have been
distributed within very small area of 200 $\times$ 200 au$^{2}$ in spite of
wide velocity range (> 100 km s$^{-1}$). The light curve shows notably
intermittent variation and suggests that the H$_{2}$O masers in G353.273+0.641
are excited by episodic radio jet. The time-scale of \sim2 yr and
characteristic velocity of \sim500 km s$^{-1}$ also support this
interpretation. Two isolated velocity components of C50 (-53 \pm 7 km s$^{-1}$)
and C70 (-73 \pm 7 km s$^{-1}$) have shown synchronised linear acceleration of
the flux weighted $V_{\rmn{LSR}}$ values (\sim-5 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$) during
the flare phase. This can be converted to the lower-limit momentum rate of 1.1
\times 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\sun}$ km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. Maser properties are quite
similar to that of IRAS 20126+4104 especially. This corroborates the previous
suggestion that G353.273+0.641 is a candidate of high mass protostellar object.

diffusion Monte Carlo method and a realistic semi-empirical pairwise potential
to describe the He-He interactions. Specifically, we calculate the value of the
elastic constants of hcp helium C_{ij} as a function of pressure up to 110 bar.
It is found that the pressure dependence of all five non-zero C_{ij} is linear
and we provide accurate parametrization of each of them. Our elastic constants
results are compared to previous variational calculations and low-temperature
measurements and in general notably good agreement is found among them.
Furthermore, we report T = 0 results for the Gruneisen parameters, sound
velocities and Debye temperature of hcp 4He. This work represents the first of
a series of computational studies aimed at thoroughly characterizing the
response of solid helium to external stress-strain.

image retrieval. The Dominant Color Descriptor (DCD) represents a few
perceptually dominant colors in an image through color quantization. For image
retrieval based on DCD, the earth mover's distance and the optimal color
composition distance are proposed to measure the dissimilarity between two
images. Although providing good retrieval results, both methods are too
time-consuming to be used in a large image database. To solve the problem, we
propose a new distance function that calculates an approximate earth mover's
distance in linear time. To calculate the dissimilarity in linear time, the
proposed approach employs the space-filling curve for multidimensional color
space. To improve the accuracy, the proposed approach uses multiple curves and
adjusts the color positions. As a result, our approach achieves
order-of-magnitude time improvement but incurs small errors. We have performed
extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
approach. The results reveal that our approach achieves almost the same results
with the EMD in linear time.

Li abundance, and interstellar absorption are investigated to provide
constraints on the age and distance of CoRoT-2. Furthermore, our UVES data
confirm the presence of a late-type stellar companion to CoRoT-2A that is
gravitationally bound to the system. The Chandra data provide a clear detection
of coronal X-ray emission from CoRoT-2A, for which we obtain an X-ray
luminosity of 1.9e29 erg/s. The potential stellar companion remains undetected
in X-rays. Our results indicate that the distance to the CoRoT-2 system is
approximately 270 pc, and the most likely age lies between 100 and 300 Ma. Our
X-ray observations show that the planet is immersed in an intense field of
high-energy radiation. Surprisingly, CoRoT-2A's likely coeval stellar
companion, which we find to be of late-K spectral type, remains X-ray dark.

Reynolds numbers, when most of the dissipation comes from the mean flow, we
predict that the non-dimensional torque $G=T/\nu^2L$, where $L$ is the cylinder

convection at large Prandtl number $Pr$ using a quasi-linear theory. We show
that two regimes arise, depending on the Reynolds number $Re$. At low Reynolds
number, $Nu Pr^{-1/2}$ and $Re$ are a function of $Ra Pr^{-3/2}$. At large
Reynolds number $Nu Pr^{1/3}$ and $Re Pr$ are function only of $Ra Pr^{2/3}$
(within logarithmic corrections). In practice, since $Nu$ is always close to
$Ra^{1/3}$, this corresponds to a much weaker dependence of the heat transfer
in the Prandtl number at low Reynolds number than at large Reynolds number.
This difference may solve an existing controversy between measurements in SF6
(large $Re$) and in alcohol/water (lower $Re$). We link these regimes with a
possible global bifurcation in the turbulent mean flow. We further show how a
scaling theory could be used to describe these two regimes through a single
universal function. This function presents a bimodal character for intermediate
range of Reynolds number. We explain this bimodality in term of two dissipation
regimes, one in which fluctuation dominate, and one in which mean flow
dominates. Altogether, our results provide a six parameters fit of the curve
$Nu(Ra,Pr)$ which may be used to describe all measurements at $Pr\ge 0.7$.

high-energy hadron reactions. They are used for investigating properties of
quark-hadron matters in heavy-ion collisions, for finding the origin of nucleon
spin in polarized lepton-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon reactions, and possibly
for finding exotic hadrons. In describing the hadron-production cross sections
in high-energy reactions, fragmentation functions are essential quantities. A
fragmentation function indicates the probability of producing a hadron from a
parton in the leading order of the running coupling constant $\alpha_s$. Its
$Q^2$ dependence is described by the standard DGLAP
(Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi) evolution equations, which are
often used in theoretical and experimental analyses of the fragmentation
functions and in calculating semi-inclusive cross sections. The DGLAP equations
are complicated integro-differential equations, which cannot be solved in an
analytical method. In this work, a simple method is employed for solving the
evolution equations by using Gauss-Legendre quadrature for evaluating
integrals, and a useful code is provided for calculating the $Q^2$ evolution of
the fragmentation functions in the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order
(NLO) of $\alpha_s$. The renormalization scheme is $\overline{MS}$ in the NLO
evolution. Our evolution code is explained for using it in one's studies on the
fragmentation functions.

descending from reconnection regions toward solar post-flare arcades seem to be
two different observational signatures of retracting, isolated reconnected flux
tubes with irreducible three-dimensional geometries. This dissertation
describes work in refining and improving a novel model of patchy reconnection,
where only a small bundle of field lines is reconnected across a current sheet
and forms a reconnected thin flux tube. Traditional models have not been able
to explain why some of the observed SADs appear to be hot and relatively devoid
of plasma. The present work shows that plasma depletion naturally occurs in
flux tubes that are reconnected across nonuniform current sheets and slide
trough regions of decreasing magnetic field magnitude. Moreover, through a
detailed theoretical analysis of generalized thin flux tube equations, we show
that the addition to the model of pressure-driven parallel dynamics, as well as
temperature-dependent, anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity is
essential for self-consistently producing gas-dynamic shocks inside reconnected
tubes that heat and compress plasma to observed temperatures and densities. The
shock thickness can be as long as the entire tube and heat can be conducted
along tube's legs, possibly driving chromospheric evaporation. We developed a
computer program that solves numerically the thin flux tube equations that
govern the retraction of reconnected tubes. Simulations carried out with this
program corroborate our theoretical predictions. A comparison of these
simulations with fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations is
presented to assess the validity of the thin flux tube model. We also present
an observational method based on total emission measure and mean temperature to
determine where in the current sheet a tube was reconnected.

have formed and evolved in relative isolation to study the nature and origin of
the AGN phenomenon. The galaxies in our sample have line fluxes with S/N>3 and
were separated using a standard diagnostic diagram into Star Forming Galaxies
(SFGs; 36.0%), Transition type Objects (TOs; 28.4%) and Narrow-Line AGNs
(NLAGNs; 35.6%). Having found a strong correlation between the bulge mass and
the NLAGN phenomenon, we have applied the same relation as for the Broad-Line
AGNs to estimate their black hole (BH) masses. The BH in the NLAGNs are 2 to 3
orders lower in mass than the BHs found in BLAGNs, but are comparable to those
observed in Narrow-Line Seyfert~1, although none of our objects can be
classified as such. To determine the metallicities, [O/H], of the NLAGNs we
calibrated the standard diagnostic diagram [OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha using similar
relation as for the SFGs, which reproduce the values obtained with CLOUDY
simulations developed for Bennert et al. [3]. For some individual objects we
compared our line ratios with other CLOUDY similations by different authors.
This suggests we achieve a typical uncertainty of 0.2 dex on [O/H], increasing
to 0.3-0.5 in the Seyfert~2 (S2). This calibration suggests the metallicities
of the NLAGNs are subsolar, varying between 1 and 0.3 $Z_\odot$. We find two
statistically significant positive correlations: for [O/H] with the BH mass and
for [O/H] with the luminosity at 5100\AA, $\lambda L(5100$\AA$)$. No
correlation is found between [O/H] and the accretion rate, L_bol/L_Edd.
However, comparisons with the BLAGNs suggest the NLAGNs extend the
metallicity-accretion rate relationship [24] to the low metallicity regime.
Although the NLS1 have similar BH masses as the NLAGNs they show higher

It follows that the fluidfluid phase stability region where reversible
supramolecular polymer chains can be mixed with nanospheres is sensitive to the
energy of scission between the monomers and to the nanoparticle radius. One can
then expect the fluidfluid coexistence curves to have a strong dependence on
temperature and that shifting of phase boundaries within a single experimental
system should be possible by varying the temperature. The calculations reveal
the width of the stability region to be rather small. This implies that phase
homogeneity of product formulations containing reversible supramolecular

place due to the tunneling of hydrogen through the potential barriers between

changes in the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, and have different

normal metal and a strongly-correlated superconductor in an applied magnetic
field in the Pauli limit. Depending on the field strength the superconductor is
either in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS), or in the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state of the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) type.
The strong correlations are accounted for by means of the Gutzwiller method
what leads naturally to the emergence of the spin-dependent masses (SDM) of
quasiparticles when the system is spin-polarized. The case without strong
correlations (with the spin-independent masses, SIM) is analyzed for
comparison. We consider both the s-wave and the d-wave symmetries of the
superconducting gap and concentrate on the parallel orientation of the Cooper
pair momentum Q with respect to the junction interface. The junction
conductance is presented for selected barrier strengths (i.e., in the contact,
intermediate, and tunneling limits). The conductance spectra in the cases with
and without strong correlations differ essentially. Our analysis provides thus
an experimentally accessible test for the presence of strong-correlations in
the superconducting state. Namely, correlations alter the distance between the
conductance peaks (or related conductance features) for carriers with spin-up
and spin-down. In the uncorrelated case, this distance is twice the Zeeman
energy. In the correlated case, the corresponding distance is about 30-50%
smaller, but other models may provide even stronger difference, depending on
details of the system electronic structure. It turns out that the strong
correlations manifest themselves most clearly in the case of the junction with
the BCS, rather than the FFLO superconductor, what should make the experimental
verification of the present results simpler.

to buy or sell according to its personal opinion, which results from the

sequentially the behavior of a group of random selection of other agents. Its
choice is then determined by a local majority rule including itself. Whenever
the selected group is at a tie, i.e., it is undecided on what to do, the choice
is determined by the local group belief with respect to the anticipated trend
at that time. These local adjustments create a dynamic that leads the market
price formation. In case of balanced anticipations the market is found to be
efficient in being successful to make the ""right price"" to emerge from the
sequential aggregation of all the local individual informations which all
together contain the fundamental value. However, when a leading optimistic
belief prevails, the same efficient market mechanisms are found to produce a
bullish dynamic even though most agents have bearish private informations. The
market yields then a wider and wider discrepancy between the fundamental value
and the market value, which in turn creates a speculative bubble. Nevertheless,
there exists a limit in the growing of the bubble where private opinions take

systems that arise in chemical engineering and systems biology. In general,
determining whether a chemical reaction network admits multiple steady states
is difficult, as this requires determining existence of multiple positive
solutions to a large system of polynomials with unknown coefficients. However,
in certain cases, various easy criteria can be applied. One such test is the
Jacobian Criterion, due to Craciun and Feinberg, which gives sufficient
conditions for ruling out the possibility of multiple steady states. A chemical
reaction network is said to pass the Jacobian Criterion if all terms in the
determinant expansion of its parametrized Jacobian matrix have the same sign.
In this article, we present a procedure which simplifies the application of the
Jacobian Criterion, and as a result, we identify a new class of networks for
which multiple steady states is precluded: those in which all chemical species
have total molecularity of at most two. The total molecularity of a species
refers to the sum of all of its stoichiometric coefficients in the network. We

The scale heights are derived from vertical equilibrium. The accuracy of the
usual thickness correction, 1/(1+kH), is better than 6% in the growth rate when
compared to exact integrations for the gravitational acceleration in the disk.
Gas dissipation extends the instability to small scales, removing the minimum
Jeans length. This makes infinitesimally thin disks unstable for all Toomre-Q
values, and reasonably thick disks stable at high Q primarily because of
thickness effects. The conventional gas+star threshold, Qtot increases from ~1
without dissipation to 2 or 3 when dissipation has a rate equal to the crossing
rate over a perturbation scale. Observations of Qtot~2-3 and the presence of
supersonic turbulence suggest that disks are unstable over a wide range of
scales. Such instabilities drive spiral structure if there is shear and clumpy
structure if shear is weak; they may dominate the generation of turbulence.
Feedback regulation of Qtot is complex because the stellar component does not
cool; the range of spiral strengths from multiple arm to flocculent galaxies
suggests that feedback is weak. Gravitational instabilities may have a
connection to star formation even when the star formation rate scales directly
with the molecular mass because the instabilities return dispersed gas to
molecular clouds and complete the cycle of cloud formation and destruction. The
mass flow to dense clouds by instabilities can be 10 times larger than the star
formation rate.

using English alphabets for web pages in Pakistan. For this purpose we
developed two websites, one with a normal English fonts and other in a local

shows that the proposed plain language text scheme using English alphabets
improved the reading comprehension for non native English speakers in Pakistan.

Schr\""odinger equation is solved by a basis set expansion in terms of a linear
combination of Wigner functions respecting the corresponding symmetries, which
allows us to distinguish avoided crossings from genuine ones. Using the
fluorobenzene and pyridazine molecules as prototypes, the rotational spectra
and properties are analyzed for experimentally accessible static field
strengths and laser intensities. Results for energy shifts, orientation,
alignment and hybridization of the angular motion are presented as the field

aligned in the other two angles.

in width in the previously known BL Lac object PKS 0138-097, which we
tentatively identified as a Mg II BAL. This is the first detection of a BAL,
which is sometimes seen in powerful quasars with high accretion rates, in a BL
Lac object. The BAL was clearly detected in its spectra of two epochs at a high
luminosity state taken in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), while it
disappeared in three SDSS spectra taken at a low luminosity state. The BAL and
its variability pattern was also found in its historical multi-epoch spectra in
the literature, but has been overlooked previously. In its high resolution
radio maps, PKS 0138-097 shows a core plus an one-sided parsec-scale jet. The
BAL variability can be interpreted as follows: The optical emission is
dominated by the core in a high state and by the jet in a low state, and the
BAL material is located between the core and jet so that the BAL appears only
when the core is shining. Our discovery suggests that outflows may also be
produced in active galactic nuclei at a low accreting state.

sources of the northern sky. From December 2007 until June 2008 it was
intensively observed in the very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) band by the
single-dish Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov telescope (MAGIC-I).
Aims: We aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of the
blazar jet during active states. Methods: We performed a dense monitoring of
the source in VHE with MAGIC-I, and also collected complementary data in soft
X-rays and optical-UV bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions
(SED) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotron
self--compton (SSC) framework. Results: The source showed intense and prolonged
gamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (E > 200 GeV)
seldom below the level of the Crab Nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.
Eight datasets of simultaneous optical-UV (KVA, Swift/UVOT), soft X-ray
(Swift/XRT) and MAGIC-I VHE data were obtained during different outburst
phases. The data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once the
spectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework of
a single-zone SSC leptonic model. Conclusions: The main outcome of the study is
that within the homogeneous model high Doppler factors (40 <= delta <= 80) are
needed to reproduce the observed SED; but this model cannot explain the
observed short time-scale variability, while it can be argued that
inhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme Doppler factors, more intense
magnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour or
sub-hour scale variability.

Referred to by engineers as a ""clocked flip-flop,"" this paired-pendulum
mechanism pervades scientific investigation. It shapes evidence by imposing
discrete phases of allowable leeway in clock readings; and it generates a
mathematical form of evidence that neither assumes a geometry nor assumes
quantum states, and so separates statements of evidence from further
assumptions required to explain that evidence, whether the explanations are
made in quantum terms or in terms of general relativity. Cleansed of
unnecessary assumptions, these expressions of evidence form a platform on which
to consider the working together of general relativity and quantum theory as
explanatory language for evidence from clock networks, such as the Global
Positioning System. Quantum theory puts Planck's constant into explanations of
the required timing leeway, while explanations of leeway also draw on the
theory of general relativity, prompting the question: does Planck's constant in
the timing leeway put the long known tension between quantum theory and general
relativity in a new light?

(M53). The technique of difference image analysis has been used which enables
photometric precisions better than 10 mmag for stars brighter than V 18.5mag
even in the crowded central regions of the cluster. The high photometric
precision has resulted in the discovery of two new RR1 stars and thirteen SX
Phe stars. A detailed identification chart is given for all the variable stars
in the field of our images of the cluster. Periodicities were calculated for
all RR Lyraes and SX Phe stars and a critical comparison is made with previous
determinations.
  Out of four probable SX Phe variables reported by Dekany & Kovacs (2009), the
SX Phe nature is confirmed only for V80, V81 is an unlikely case while V82 and
V83 remain as dubious cases. Previous misidentifications of three variables are
corrected. Astrometric positions with an uncertainty of ~ 0.3 arcsec are
provided for all variables.
  The light curve Fourier decomposition of RR0 and RR1 is discussed, we find a
mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.92+-0.06 in the scale of Zinn & West from 19 RR0
stars. The true distance moduli 16.36+-0.05 and 16.28+-0.07 and the
corresponding distances 18.7+-0.4 and 18.0+-0.5 kpc are found from the RR0 and
RR1 stars respectively. These values are in agreement with the theoretical
period-luminosity relations for RR Lyrae stars in the I band and with recent
luminosity determinations for the RR Lyrae stars in the LMC.
  The age of 13.25+-0.50 Gyr (Dotter et al. 2010), for NGC 5024, E(B-V)=0.02
and the above physical parameters of the cluster, as indicated from the RR0
stars, produce a good isochrone fitting to the observed CMD.
  The PL relation for SX Phe stars in NGC 5024 in the V and I bands is
discussed in the light of the 13 newly found SX Phe stars and their pulsation
mode is identified in most cases.
