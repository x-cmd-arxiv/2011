space of planning domains typically modeled as a directed graph. However,
prohibitively large sizes of the search space make search expensive. Developing
better heuristic functions has been the main technique for improving search
efficiency. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that improving heuristics
alone has certain fundamental limits on improving search efficiency. Recently,
a new direction of research called partial order based reduction (POR) has been
proposed as an alternative to improving heuristics. POR has shown promise in
speeding up searches.
  POR has been extensively studied in model checking research and is a key
enabling technique for scalability of model checking systems. Although the POR
theory has been extensively studied in model checking, it has never been
developed systematically for planning before. In addition, the conditions for
POR in the model checking theory are abstract and not directly applicable in
planning. Previous works on POR algorithms for planning did not establish the
connection between these algorithms and existing theory in model checking.
  In this paper, we develop a theory for POR in planning. The new theory we
develop connects the stubborn set theory in model checking and POR methods in
planning. We show that previous POR algorithms in planning can be explained by
the new theory. Based on the new theory, we propose a new, stronger POR
algorithm. Experimental results on various planning domains show further search
cost reduction using the new algorithm.

contains different amounts of information for recipients that have (or do not
have) certain a priori information. Assume, for example, that the recipient
knows some string $a$, and we want to send her some information that allows her
to reconstruct some string $b$ (using $a$). On the other hand, this information
alone should not allow the eavesdropper (who does not know $a$) to reconstruct
$b$. It is indeed possible (if the strings $a$ and $b$ are not too simple).
Then we consider more complicated versions of this question. What if the
eavesdropper knows some string $c$? How long should be our message? We provide
some conditions that guarantee the existence of a polynomial-size message; we
show then that without these conditions this is not always possible.

the cooling by CO and H2O, as this provides decisive information for the
understanding of the oxygen chemistry behind interstellar shock waves. Methods.
The high sensitivity of HIFI, in combination with its high spectral resolution
capability, allows us to trace the H2O outflow wings at unprecedented
signal-to-noise. From the observation of spectrally resolved H2O and CO lines
in the HH52-54 system, both from space and from ground, we arrive at the
spatial and velocity distribution of the molecular outflow gas. Solving the
statistical equilibrium and non-LTE radiative transfer equations provides us
with estimates of the physical parameters of this gas, including the cooling
rate ratios of the species. The radiative transfer is based on an ALI code,
where we use the fact that variable shock strengths, distributed along the
front, are naturally implied by a curved surface. Based on observations of CO
and H2O spectral lines, we conclude that the emission is confined to the HH54
region. The quantitative analysis of our observations favours a ratio of the
CO-to-H2O-cooling-rate >> 1. From the best-fit model to the CO emission, we
arrive at an H2O abundance close to 1e-5. The line profiles exhibit two
components, one of which is triangular and another, which is a superposed,
additional feature. This additional feature likely originates from a region
smaller than the beam where the ortho-water abundance is smaller than in the
quiescent gas. Comparison with recent shock models indicate that a planar shock
can not easily explain the observed line strengths and triangular line
profiles.We conclude that the geometry can play an important role. Although
abundances support a scenario where J-type shocks are present, higher cooling
rate ratios than predicted by these type of shocks are derived.

The observed pulsed fraction exhibited an anti-correlation with phase-averaged
flux. Properties of the several hundred X-ray bursts during the 2009 outburst
were determined and compared to those from other magnetar outburst events. We
find that the peaks of the bursts occur randomly in phase but that the folded
counts that compose the bursts exhibit a pulse which is misaligned with the
persistent pulse phase. We also report a correlation between burst hardness and
flux. We compare the hardness-flux evolution of the persistent emission of both

an overall trend, the degree of hardening for a given increase in flux is not
uniform from source to source. These results are discussed in the context of

sometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully.
When the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there
exists a dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known
results). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no
dominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's
information is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the
preferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for
many common voting rules. Our results thus throw light on whether we can
prevent strategic behavior by limiting information about the votes of other
voters.

physics arises in principle provided the system is sufficiently
strongly-correlated, the temperature window over which it could be observed is
much lower than is experimentally feasible. This finding disagrees with recent
work on the problem, and we explain why. At finite field, we show that the
quantum phase transition known to arise at zero-field in the two-impurity Kondo

measuring the rate of change of vessel radii, and child vessels are segmented
by initiating new trackers at bifurcation points. Validation is accomplished
using our novel sparse surface (SS) evaluation metric. The SS metric was
designed to quantify the magnitude of the segmentation error per vessel while
significantly decreasing the manual marking burden for the human user. A total

there is little spatial correlation between [CII] observed with PACS and CO
over the mapped region. There is even less spatial correlation between [CII]

intensities towards the HII region with models of photo ionization and photon
dominated regions, confirms that a significant fraction, 20--30%, of the

cloud. The gas heating efficiency, using the ratio between [CII] and the TIR as

dimension (1D) is characterized at intermediate correlation $U = 4t$ by exact
treatment of $N$-site systems. Linear coupling to lattice (Peierls) phonons and
molecular (Holstein) vibrations are treated in the adiabatic approximation. The
molar magnetic susceptibility $\chi_M(T)$ is obtained directly up to $N = 10$.
The goal is to find the consequences of a doubly degenerate ground state (gs)
and finite magnetic gap $E_m$ in a regular array. Degenerate gs with broken
inversion symmetry are constructed for finite $N$ for a range of $V$ near the
charge density wave (CDW) boundary at $V \approx 2.18t$ where $E_m \approx
0.5t$ is large. The electronic amplitude $B(V)$ of the BOW in the regular array
is shown to mimic a tight-binding band with small effective dimerization
$\delta_{eff}$. Electronic spin and charge solitons are elementary excitations
of the BOW phase and also resemble topological solitons with small
$\delta_{eff}$. Strong infrared intensity of coupled molecular vibrations in
dimerized 1D systems is shown to extend to the regular BOW phase, while its
temperature dependence is related to spin solitons. The Peierls instability to
dimerization has novel aspects for degenerate gs and substantial $E_m$ that
suppresses thermal excitations. Finite $E_m$ implies exponentially small
$\chi_M(T)$ at low temperature followed by an almost linear increase with $T$.
The EHM with $U = 4t$ is representative of intermediate correlations in
quasi-1D systems such as conjugated polymers or organic ion-radical and
charge-transfer salts. The vibronic and thermal properties of correlated models
with BOW phases are needed to identify possible physical realizations.

two processes: the increasing of pressure forcing applied to the boundary layer

the intensification of tropical storm with the redistribution of wind
velocities, pressure and temperature can result from the reorganization of the
dissipative structure which key parameters are the moist air lifting velocity
and the temperature of surrounding atmosphere. This reorganization can lead to
formation of hurricane eye and inner ring of convection. A transition of the
dissipative structure in a new state can occur when the temperature lapse rate
in a zone of air lifting reaches certain critical value. The accordance of
observational data with the proposed theoretical description is shown.

To model the spectral swapping which is one of the possible outcome of the
collective neutrino oscillations, we parametrize the onset time when the
spectral swap begins, the radius where the spectral swap occurs, and the
threshold energy above which the spectral interchange between heavy-lepton
neutrinos and electron/anti-electron neutrinos takes place, respectively. By
doing so, we systematically study how the neutrino heating enhanced by the
spectral swapping could affect the shock evolution as well as the matter
ejection. We also investigate the progenitor dependence using a suite of
progenitor models (13, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\odot$). We find that there is a
critical heating rate induced by the spectral swapping to trigger explosions,
which significantly differs between the progenitors. The critical heating rate
is generally smaller for 2D than 1D due to the multidimensionality that
enhances the neutrino heating efficiency. For the progenitors employed in this
paper, the final remnant masses are estimated to range in 1.1-1.5$M_\odot$. For
our 2D model of the $15M_\odot$ progenitor, we find a set of the oscillation
parameters that could account for strong supernova explosions ($\sim 10^{51}$
erg), simultaneously leaving behind the remnant mass close to $\sim 1.4

\approx 2$. At present 25 out of 40 galaxies are quiescent with structural
parameters (sizes and velocity dispersions) in agreement with local early type
galaxies. At z=2 all simulated galaxies with $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ (11
out of 40) at z=2 are compact with projected half-mass radii of $\approx$ 0.77
($\pm$0.24) kpc and line-of-sight velocity dispersions within the projected
half-mass radius of $\approx$ 262 ($\pm$28) kms$^{-1}$ (3 out of 11 are already
quiescent). Similar to observed compact early-type galaxies at high redshift
the simulated galaxies are clearly offset from the local mass-size and
mass-velocity dispersion relations. Towards redshift zero the sizes increase by
a factor of $\sim 5-6$, following $R_{1/2} \propto (1+z)^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha
= -1.44$ for quiescent galaxies ($\alpha = -1.12$ for all galaxies). The
velocity dispersions drop by about one-third since $z \approx 2$, following
$\sigma_{1/2} \propto (1+z)^{\beta}$ with $\beta = 0.44$ for the quiescent
galaxies ($\beta = 0.37$ for all galaxies). The simulated size and dispersion
evolution is in good agreement with observations and results from the
subsequent accretion and merging of stellar systems at $z\lesssim 2$ which is a
natural consequence of the hierarchical structure formation. A significant
number of the simulated massive galaxies (7 out of 40) experience no merger
more massive than 1:4 (usually considered as major mergers). On average, the
dominant accretion mode is stellar minor mergers with a mass-weighted
mass-ratio of 1:5. (abridged)

begun to outpace the feasibility of keeping astronomers in the real-time

the process of discovery on image differences and, 2) the generation of
preliminary science-type classifications of discovered sources. Since follow-up
resources for extracting novel science from fast-changing transients are
precious, self-calibrating classification probabilities must be couched in
terms of efficiencies for discovery and purity of the samples generated. We
estimate the purity and efficiency in identifying real sources with a two-epoch
image-difference discovery algorithm for the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)
survey. Once given a source discovery, using machine-learned classification
trained on PTF data, we distinguish between transients and variable stars with
a 3.8% overall error rate (with 1.7% errors for imaging within the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey footprint). At >96% classification efficiency, the samples
achieve 90% purity. Initial classifications are shown to rely primarily on
context-based features, determined from the data itself and external archival
databases. In the ~one year since autonomous operations, this discovery and
classification framework has led to several significant science results, from
outbursting young stars to subluminous Type IIP supernovae to candidate tidal
disruption events. We discuss future directions of this approach, including the
possible roles of crowdsourcing and the scalability of machine learning to
future surveys such a the Large Synoptical Survey Telescope (LSST).

intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), and the stringent limits placed upon the
unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) by Fermi has been used to
argue against a large number of such objects at high redshifts. However, these
are predicated upon the assumption that inverse-Compton scattering is the
primary energy-loss mechanism for the ultra-relativistic pairs produced by the
annihilation of the energetic gamma rays on extragalactic background light
photons. Here we show that for sufficiently bright TeV sources
(isotropic-equivalent luminosities >10^{42} erg/s) plasma beam instabilities,
specifically the ""oblique"" instability, present a plausible mechanism by which
the energy of these pairs can be dissipated locally, heating the intergalactic
medium. Since these instabilities typically grow on timescales short in
comparison to the inverse-Compton cooling rate, they necessarily suppress the
inverse-Compton cascades. As a consequence, this places a severe constraint
upon efforts to limit the IGMF from the lack of a discernible GeV bump in TeV
sources. Similarly, it considerably weakens the Fermi limits upon the evolution
of blazar populations. Specifically, we construct a TeV-blazar luminosity
function from those objects presently observed and find that it is very well
described by the quasar luminosity function at z~0.1, shifted to lower
luminosities and number densities, suggesting that both classes of sources are
regulated by similar processes. Extending this relationship to higher

unique candidate Lya emitters. The availability of three different wavelength
tunings allows us to make estimates of the redshifts for each of the objects.
It also allows us to separate a possible protocluster from structure in the
immediate foreground. This division shows that the foreground region contains
significantly fewer Lya emitters. Also, the spatial distribution of the objects
in the protocluster field deviates from a random distribution at the 2.5 sigma
level. The observed redshift distribution of the emitters is different from the
expected distribution of a blank field at the ~3 sigma level, with the Lya
emitters concentrated near the radio galaxy at z>4.38. The 6C0140+326 field is
denser by a factor of 9+/-5 than a blank field, and the number density of Lya
emitters close to the radio galaxy is similar to that of the z~4.1 protocluster

explosions once the neutrino luminosity exceeds a critical curve, and recent
simulations indicate that turbulence further enables explosion by reducing this
critical neutrino luminosity. We propose a theoretical framework to derive this
result and take the first steps by deriving the governing mean-field equations.
Using Reynolds decomposition, we decompose flow variables into background and
turbulent flows and derive self-consistent averaged equations for their
evolution. As basic requirements for the CCSN problem, these equations
naturally incorporate steady-state accretion, neutrino heating and cooling,
non-zero entropy gradients, and turbulence terms associated with buoyant
driving, redistribution, and dissipation. Furthermore, analysis of
two-dimensional (2D) CCSN simulations validate these Reynolds-averaged
equations, and we show that the physics of turbulence entirely accounts for the
differences between 1D and 2D CCSN simulations. As a prelude to deriving the
reduction in the critical luminosity, we identify the turbulent terms that most
influence the conditions for explosion. Generically, turbulence equations
require closure models, but these closure models depend upon the macroscopic
properties of the flow. To derive a closure model that is appropriate for
CCSNe, we cull the literature for relevant closure models and compare each with
2D simulations. These models employ local closure approximations and fail to
reproduce the global properties of neutrino-driven turbulence. Motivated by the
generic failure of these local models, we propose an original model for
turbulence which incorporates global properties of the flow. This global model
accurately reproduces the turbulence profiles and evolution of 2D CCSN
simulations.

set of half-light radii (r_{1/2}) and luminosities, we describe the
size-luminosity relation of dSphs by a log-normal distribution in r_{1/2} with
a mean size that varies as a function of luminosity. Accounting for modest
number statistics, measurement uncertainties and surface brightness
limitations, we find that the size-luminosity relations of the Milky Way and
Andromeda dSph populations are statistically indistinguishable, and also very
similar: their mean sizes at a given stellar luminosity differ by no more than
30%. In addition, we find that the mean size, slope and scatter of this
log-normal size description of Local Group dSphs matches onto the relation of
more massive low-concentration galaxies. This suggests that the stellar sizes
of dSphs are ultimately related to their overall initial baryonic angular
momentum. To test this hypothesis we perform a series of high resolution N-body
simulations that we couple with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.
These predict the same mean size and slope as observed in dSph satellites. At
the same time, these models predict that the size-luminosity distributions for
satellite galaxies around similar host-halos must be similar providing a
natural explanation as to why the size distributions of Milky Way and Andromeda
satellites are similar. Although strong rotation is currently not observed in
dSphs, this may well be consistent with our angular-momentum-based explanation
for their sizes if the disks of these galaxies have become sufficiently stirred
through tidal interaction.

present the most extensive consistent analysis to date of z>4 QSOs with
observed NIR spectra, combining three new z~6 objects from our ongoing
VLT-ISAAC program with nineteen 4<z<6.5 sources from the literature. The new
sources extend the existing SDSS sample towards the faint end of the QSO

our spectral decomposition, we estimate the black hole mass (MBH), the
Eddington ratio (defined as Lbol/LEdd) and the FeII/MgII line ratio, a proxy
for the chemical abundance, to characterize both the central object and the
broad line region gas. The QSOs in our sample host BHs with masses of ~10^9
M\odot that are accreting close to the Eddington luminosity, consistent with
earlier results. We find that the distribution of observed Eddington ratios is
significantly different than that of a luminosity-matched comparison sample of
SDSS QSOs at lower redshift (0.35<z<2.25): the average <log(Lbol/LEdd)>=-0.37
(Lbol/LEdd~0.43) with a scatter of 0.20 dex for the z>4 sample and the

the z>4 sources are accreting significantly faster than the lower-redshift

to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of LIR that are in the median
consistent with the LIR derived from PACS photometry, albeit with significant
scatter. Dust correction methods perform well at low to intermediate levels of
star formation. They fail to recover the total amount of star formation in
systems with large SFR_IR/SFR_UV ratios, typically occuring at the highest SFRs
(SFR_UV+IR \gtrsim 100 Msun/yr) and redshifts (z \gtrsim 2.5) probed. Finally,
we confirm that Ha-based SFRs at 1.5<z<2.6 are consistent with SFR_SED and
SFR_UV+IR provided extra attenuation towards HII regions is taken into account
(Av,neb = Av,continuum / 0.44). With the cross-calibrated SFR indicators in
hand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred
from SED modeling. We compare the observed SFR-M relations and mass functions
at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower
redshift galaxies backwards in time. We find evidence for underestimated
stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied. We
demonstrate how resolved SED modeling, or alternatively deep UV data, may help
to overcome this bias. The age bias is most severe for galaxies with young
stellar populations, and reduces towards older systems. Finally, our analysis
suggests that SFHs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several

E>100 GeV) because they annihilate and pair produce on the extragalactic
background light. The resulting ultra-relativistic pairs are assumed to lose
energy through inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons. In Broderick et al.
(2011, Paper I of this three paper series), we argued that instead powerful
plasma instabilities in the ultra-relativistic pair beam dissipate the kinetic
energy of the TeV-generated pairs locally, heating the intergalactic medium
(IGM). Here, we explore the effect of this heating upon the thermal history of
the IGM. We collate the observed extragalactic VHEGR sources to determine a
local VHEGR heating rate and correct for the pointed nature of VHEGR
observations using Fermi observations of high and intermediate peaked BL Lacs.
Because the local extragalactic VHEGR flux is dominated by TeV blazars, we tie
the TeV blazar luminosity density to the quasar luminosity density, and produce
a VHEGR heating rate as a function of redshift. This heating is relatively
homogeneous for z<~4 with increasing spatial variation at higher redshift
(order unity at z~6). This new heating process dominates photoheating at low
redshift and the inclusion of TeV blazar heating qualitatively and
quantitatively changes the structure and history of the IGM. TeV blazars
produce a uniform volumetric heating rate that is sufficient to increase the
temperature of the mean density IGM by nearly an order of magnitude, and at low
densities by substantially more, naturally producing an inverted equation of
state inferred by observations of the Ly-alpha forest, a feature that is
difficult to reconcile with standard reionization models. Finally, we close
with a discussion on the possibility of detecting this hot low-density IGM, but
find that such measurements are currently not feasible. (abridged)

the extragalactic background light. We have argued in Broderick et al. (2011,
Paper I) that plasma beam instabilities can dissipate the pairs' energy
locally. This heats the intergalactic medium and dramatically increases its
entropy after redshift z~2, with important implications for structure
formation: (1) This suggests a scenario for the origin of the cool core
(CC)/non-cool core (NCC) bimodality in galaxy clusters and groups. Early
forming galaxy groups are unaffected because they can efficiently radiate the
additional entropy, developing a CC. However, late forming groups do not have
sufficient time to cool before the entropy is gravitationally reprocessed
through successive mergers - counteracting cooling and raising the core entropy
further. Hence blazar heating works different than feedback by active galactic
nuclei, which balances radiative cooling but is unable to transform CC into NCC
clusters due to the weak coupling to the cluster gas. (2) We predict a
suppression of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum on angular scales smaller
than 5' due to the globally reduced central pressure of groups and clusters
forming after z~1. (3) Our redshift dependent entropy floor increases the
characteristic halo mass below which dwarf galaxies cannot form by a factor of
~10 (50) at mean density (in voids) over that found in models that include
photoionization alone. This prevents the formation of late forming dwarf
galaxies (z<2) with masses ranging from 10^{10} to 10^{11} M_sun for redshifts
z~2 to 0, respectively. This may help resolve the ""missing satellite problem""
in the Milky Way and the ""void phenomenon"" of the low observed abundances of
dwarf satellites compared to cold dark matter simulations and may bring the
observed early star formation histories into agreement with galaxy formation
models. (abridged)

a TQCP to a topological superconducting (TS) state by an external Zeeman field.
Despite many attractive features of TS states, TQCPs themselves do not break
any symmetries, making it impossible to distinguish the TS state from a regular
superconductor in conventional bulk measurements. Here we show that for the
semiconductor TQCP this problem can be overcome by tracking suitable bulk
transport properties across the topological quantum critical regime itself. The
universal low-energy effective theory and the scaling form of the relevant
susceptibilities also provide a useful theoretical framework in which to
understand the topological transitions in semiconductor heterostructures. Based

the horizon scale. Further, it has been recently understood that
non-Gaussianity in the initial conditions could show up in a scale dependence
of the bias of galaxies at the largest distances. It is therefore important to
include General Relativistic effects. Here we provide a General Relativistic
generalization of the bias, valid both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial
conditions. The collapse of objects happens on very small scales, while
long-wavelength modes are always in the quasi linear regime. Around every
collapsing region, it is therefore possible to find a reference frame that is
valid for all times and where the space time is almost flat: the Fermi frame.
Here the Newtonian approximation is applicable and the equations of motion are
the ones of the N-body codes. The effects of long-wavelength modes are encoded
in the mapping from the cosmological frame to the local frame. For the linear
bias, the effect of the long-wavelength modes on the dynamics is encoded in the
local curvature of the Universe, which allows us to define a General
Relativistic generalization of the bias in the standard Newtonian setting. We
show that the bias due to this effect goes to zero as the squared ratio of the
physical wavenumber with the Hubble scale for modes longer than the horizon, as
modes longer than the horizon have no dynamical effects. However, the bias due
to non-Gaussianities does not need to vanish for modes longer than the Hubble
scale, and for non-Gaussianities of the local kind it goes to a constant. As a
further application, we show that it is not necessary to perform large N-body
simulations to extract information on long-wavelength modes: N-body simulations
can be done on small scales and long-wavelength modes are encoded simply by
adding curvature to the simulation and rescaling the coordinates.

abundance lends strong support to the core accretion theory of planet
formation. However, iron is not the most significant mass contributor to the
cores of giant planets. Since giant planet cores are thought to grow from
silicate grains with icy mantles, the likelihood of gas giant formation should
depend heavily on the oxygen and silicon abundance of the planet formation
environment. Here we compare the silicon and oxygen abundances of a set of 76
planet hosts and a control sample of 80 metal-rich stars without any known
giant planets. Our new, independent analysis was conducted using high
resolution, high signal-to-noise data obtained at McDonald Observatory. Because
we do not wish to simply reproduce the known planet-metallicity correlation, we
have devised a statistical method for matching the underlying [Fe/H]
distributions of our two sets of stars. We find a 99% probability that planet
detection rate depends on the silicon abundance of the host star, over and
above the observed planet-metallicity correlation. We do not detect any such
correlation for oxygen. Our results would thus seem to suggest that grain
nucleation, rather than subsequent icy mantle growth, is the important limiting
factor in forming giant planets via core accretion. Based on our results and
interpretation, we predict that planet detection should correlate with host
star abundance for refractory elements responsible for grain nucleation and
that no such trends should exist for the most abundant volatile elements
responsible for icy mantle growth.

substantially shorter than the Newtonian value. By accounting for dissipation

friction, we calculate the associated f-mode instability window. For our

for moderate super-cooling, e.g. close to the Mode-Coupling transition
temperature. We first derive the phase diagram in the $T-c$ plane by mean field

obtain the critical properties for $|c-c_{K}(T)|\rightarrow 0$, in particular
the divergence of length and time scales. These are dominated by two

differences when particles are frozen in other geometries and not from an

stability of the identified community structure. We note that an update order

propose a balanced propagation that counteracts for the introduced randomness
by utilizing node balancers. We have evaluated the proposed approach on
synthetic networks with planted partition, and on several real-world networks

significantly more robust than label propagation, when the performance of

surrounding individual granules, tend to be associated with granular
fragmentation, in particular, with the formation and evolution of a bright
granular lane (BGL) within individual granules. The BGLs have recently been
identified as vortex tubes by Steiner et al. We further discover the
development of a well-defined bright grain located between the BGL and the dark
intergranular lane to which it is connected. Signatures of a BGL may reach the
lower chromosphere and can be detected in off-band \ha images. Simulations also
indicate that vortex tubes are frequently associated with small-scale magnetic
fields. We speculate that the intergranular jets detected in the NST data may
result from the interaction between the turbulent small-scale fields associated
with the vortex tube and the larger-scale fields existing in the intergranular
lanes. The intergranular jets are much smaller and weaker than all previously
known jet-like events. At the same time, they appear much more numerous than
the larger events, leading us to the speculation that the total energy release

mass-flux balance near the temperature minimum atop the photosphere. The study

predicting the size of epidemics, as well as for planning effective

paths in real-world networks. One is the practical difficulty of observing a
dynamic process on a network, and the other is the typical constraint of only
partially observing a network. Using a static, structurally realistic social
network as a platform for simulations, we juxtapose three distinct paths: (1)
the stochastic path taken by a simulated spreading process from source to
target; (2) the topologically shortest path in the fully observed network, and
hence the single most likely stochastic path, between the two nodes; and (3)
the topologically shortest path in a partially observed network. In a sampled
network, how closely does the partially observed shortest path (3) emulate the
unobserved spreading path (1)? Although partial observation inflates the length
of the shortest path, the stochastic nature of the spreading process also
frequently derails the dynamic path from the shortest path. We find that the
partially observed shortest path does not necessarily give an inflated estimate
of the length of the process path; in fact, partial observation may,
counterintuitively, make the path seem shorter than it actually is.

properties of such dilute flows are expected to be modified by their large

needs to transport angular momentum as well as thermal energy generated through
gravitational infall outwards in order to allow accretion to occur. This is in
contrast to classical accretion flows, in which the energy generated through
accretion down a gravitational well is locally radiated. In this paper, using
an incompressible fluid treatment of an ionized gas, we expand on previous
research by considering the stability properties of a magnetized rotating
plasma wherein the thermal conductivity and viscosity are not negligible and
may be dynamically important. We find a class of MHD instabilities that can
transport angular momentum and thermal energy outwards. They are plausible
candidates to describe accretion in radiatively inefficient accretion flows

non-Riemannian geometry, namely, Weyl geometry. We show that the new
mathematical formalism may lead to different pictures of the same gravitational
phenomena, by making use of the concept of Weyl frames. We show that, in this
formalism, it is possible to construct a scalar-tensor gravitational theory
that is invariant with respect to the so-called Weyl tranformations and reduces
to general relativity in a particular frame, the Riemann frame. In this
approach the Weyl geometry plays a fundamental role since it appears as the
natural geometrical setting of the theory when viewed in an arbitrary frame.
Our starting point is to build an action that is manifestly invariant with
respect to Weyl transformations. When this action is expressed in more familiar
terms of Riemannian geometry we find that the theory has some similarities with
Brans-Dicke theory of gravity. We illustrate this point with an example in
which a known Brans-Dicke vacuum solution may appear when reinterpreted in a
particular Weyl frame.

another source of ionizing photons is required. In this \emph{Letter}, we
examine the possibility that these can be supplied by the fast accretion shocks
formed around the cores of the most massive haloes ($10.5< \log M/M_{\odot} <
12$) on spatial scales of order 1 kpc. We model the detailed physics of these
fast accretion shocks, and apply these to a simple 1-D spherical hydrodynamic
accretion model for baryonic infall in dark matter halos with an Einasto
density distribution. The escape of UV photons from these halos is delayed by
the time taken to reach the critical accretion shock velocity for escape of UV
photons; 220 km s$^{-1}$, and by the time it takes for these photons to ionize
the surrounding baryonic matter in the accretion flow. Assuming that in the
universe at large the baryonic matter tracks the dark matter, we can estimate
the epoch of re-ionization in the case that accretion shocks act alone as the
source of UV photons. We find that 50% of the volume (and 5-8% of the mass) of
the universe can be ionized by $z \sim 7-8$. The UV production rate has an
uncertainty of a factor of about 5 due to uncertainties in the cosmological
parameters controlling the development of large scale structure. Because our
mechanism is a steeply rising function of decreasing redshift, this uncertainty
translates to a re-ionization redshift uncertainty of less than $\pm0.5$. We
also find that, even without including the UV photon production of stars,
re-ionization is essentially complete by $z \sim 5.8$. Thus, fast accretion
shocks can provide an important additional source of ionizing photons in the
early universe.

data analyses. In particular, we study how much the uncertainties on both the

non-Gaussianity of the non-linear density field. We examine two possible
impacts of non-Gaussian analysis: (1) we derive the distance estimators from
Gaussian theory, but use 1000 N-Body simulations to measure the actual errors,
and compare this to the Gaussian prediction, and (2) we compute new optimal
estimators, which requires the inverse of the non-Gaussian covariance matrix of
the matter power spectrum. Obtaining an accurate and precise inversion is
challenging, and we opted for a noise reduction technique applied on the
covariance matrices. By measuring the bootstrap error on the inverted matrix,
this work quantifies for the first time the significance of the non-Gaussian
error corrections on the BAO dilation scale. We find that the variance (error
squared) on distance measurements can deviate by up to 12% between both
estimators, an effect that requires a large number of simulations to be
resolved. We next apply a reconstruction algorithm to recover some of the BAO
signal that had been smeared by non-linear evolution, and we rerun the
analysis. We find that after reconstruction, the rms error on the distance
measurement improves by a factor of ~1.7 at low redshift (consistent with
previous results), and the variance ({\sigma}^2) shows a change of up to 18%
between optimal and sub-optimal cases (note, however, that these discrepancies
may depend in detail on the procedure used to isolate the BAO signal). We

show it we reduce the problem, to the investigation of an infinite-dimensional
nonlinear equation. We find a condition on weights to show that the derived
equation has two solutions, which yields the existence of the phase transition.
We prove that measures corresponding to first and second solutions are a
$p$-adic Gibbs and generalized $p$-adic Gibbs measures, respectively. Note that
it turns out that the finding condition does not depend on values of the prime
$p$, and therefore, an analogous fact is not true when the number of spins is
finite. Note that, in the usual real case, if one considers one dimensional
translation-invariant model with nearest neighbor interaction, then such a
model does not exhibit a phase transition. Nevertheless, we should stress that
in our model there does not occur the strong phase transition, this means that
there is only one $p$-adic Gibbs measure. Here we may see some similarity with

external field in two dimensions based on the model equations for the center of

of external force. One is a gravitational-like force which enters additively in
the time-evolution equation for the center of mass. The other is an
electric-like force supposing that a dipole moment is induced in the particle.
This force is added to the equation for the deformation tensor. It is shown
that a rich variety of dynamics appears by changing the strength of the forces
and the migration velocity of self-propelled particle.

degree of freedom corresponding to a massive scalar mode of gravitational wave.
For viable $f(R)$ models, since there always exits a de-Sitter point where the
background curvature in vacuum is non-zero, the mass squared of the scalar mode
of gravitational wave is about the de-Sitter point curvature
$R_{d}\sim10^{-66}eV^{2}$. We illustrate our results in two types of viable

the mass will be in the order of $10^{-33}eV$ when it propagates in vacuum.
However, in the presence of matter density in galaxy, the scalar mode can be
heavy. Explicitly, in the exponential gravity model, the mass becomes almost
infinity, implying the disappearance of the scalar mode of gravitational wave,

cosmological ""live host"". Simple prescriptions for assigning stellar
populations to collisionless particles are able to reproduce many properties of
the observed Milky Way halo and its surviving dwarf satellites, like velocity
dispersions, sizes, brightness profiles, metallicities, and spatial
distribution. Our model predicts the existence of approximately 1,850 subhalos
harboring ""extremely faint"" satellites (with mass-to-light ratios >5,000) lying
beyond the Sloan Digital Sky Survey detection threshold. Of these, about 20 are
""first galaxies"", i.e. satellites that formed a stellar mass above 10 Msun
before redshift 9. The ten most luminous satellites (L> 1e6 Lsun) in the
simulation are hosted by subhalos with peak circular velocities today in the
range V_max=10-40 km/s that have shed between 80% and 99% of their dark mass
after being accreted at redshifts 1.7< z <4.6. The satellite maximum circular
velocity and stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion today follow the
relation V_max=2.2 sigma_los. We apply a standard mass estimation algorithm
based on Jeans modelling of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles to
the simulated dwarf spheroidals, and test the accuracy of this technique. The
inner (within 300 pc) mass-luminosity relation for currently detectable
satellites is nearly flat in our model, in qualitative agreement with the
""common mass scale"" found in Milky Way dwarfs. We do, however, predict a weak,
but significant positive correlation for these objects: M_300 ~L^{0.088 \pm
0.024}.

long-distance fluctuations in a nontrivial way. This approach yields a phase
diagram in very good quantitative agreement with quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, and reproduces the two universality classes of the
superfluid--Mott-insulator transition. The critical behavior near the
multicritical points, where the transition takes place at constant density,
agrees with the original predictions of Fisher {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. B {\bf
40}, 546 (1989)] based on simple scaling arguments. At a generic transition
point, the critical behavior is mean-field like with logarithmic corrections in
two dimensions. In the weakly-correlated superfluid phase (far away from the
Mott insulating phase), the renormalization-group flow is controlled by the
Bogoliubov fixed point down to a characteristic (Ginzburg) momentum scale $k_G$
which is much smaller than the inverse healing length $k_h$. In the vicinity of
the multicritical points, when the density is commensurate, we identify a sharp
crossover from a weakly- to a strongly-correlated superfluid phase where the
condensate density and the superfluid stiffness are strongly suppressed and
both $k_G$ and $k_h$ are of the order of the inverse lattice spacing.

clumps that form by violent gravitational instability in high-z disc galaxies.
Guidance is provided by an analytic model, where the proto-clumps are cut from
a rotating disc and collapse to equilibrium while preserving angular momentum.
This model predicts prograde clump rotation. This is confirmed in hydro-AMR
zoom-in simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. In most high-z
clumps, the centrifugal force dominates the support, R=Vrot^2/Vcirc^2 > 0.5,
where Vrot is the rotation velocity and Vcirc is the circular velocity. The
clump spin indeed tends to be in the sense of the global disc angular momentum,
but substantial tilts are frequent. Most clumps are in Jeans equilibrium, with
the rest of the support provided by turbulence. Simulations of isolated
gas-rich discs that resolve the clump substructure reveal that the cosmological
simulations may overestimate R by ~30%, but the dominance of rotational support
at high-z is not a resolution artifact. In turn, isolated gas-poor disc
simulations produce at z=0 smaller gaseous non-rotating transient clouds,
indicating that the difference in rotational support is associated with the
fraction of cold baryons in the disc. In our current cosmological simulations,
the clump rotation velocity is typically Vrot~100 km/s, but when beam smearing
of \geq 0.1 arcsec is imposed, the rotation signal is reduced to a small
gradient of \leq 30 km/s/kpc across the clump. The velocity dispersion in the
simulated clumps is comparable to the disc dispersion so it is expected to
leave only a marginal signal. Retrograde minor-merging galaxies could lead to
massive clumps that do not show rotation.Testable predictions of the scenario
as simulated are that the mean stellar age of the clumps, and the stellar
fraction, are declining linearly with distance from the disc center.

gradient direction and the vorticity direction. At high shear rates, when the
system is strongly anisotropic, the fluctuation-dissipation ratio derived

temperatures along the gradient direction are somewhat higher than those along
the vorticity direction. The temperatures derived from the static linear

confirmed by direct simulations. This includes more general situations where

for the case of constant $K$ and zero damping we use the collective coordinate

particularly active star formation over the past hundred Myr in IZw 18. The
stellar spatial distribution shows that the younger ones are more centrally
concentrated, while old and intermediate age stars are distributed
homogeneously over the two bodies, although more easily detectable at the
system periphery. The oldest stars are best visible in the Secondary Body (SB)
and in the South East (SE) portion of the MB, where crowding is less severe,
but are present also in the rest of the MB, although measured with larger
uncertainties. The youngest stars are a few Myr old, are located predominantly
in the MB and mostly concentrated in its NW portion. The SE portion of the MB
appears to be in a similar, but not as young evolutionary stage as the NW,
while the SB stars are older than at least 10 Myr. There is then a sequence of
decreasing age of the younger stars from the Secondary Body to the SE portion

dynamically insignificant HI gas in the discs of spiral galaxies and the
dominant contribution of DM - the ""Bosma effect"" - has been repeatedly
mentioned in the literature but largely ignored. We have re-examined the
evidence for the Bosma effect by fitting Bosma effect models for 17 galaxies in
the THINGS data set, either by scaling the contribution of the HI gas alone or
by using both the observed stellar disc and HI gas as proxies. The results are
compared with two models for exotic cold DM: internally consistent cosmological
NFW models with constrained compactness parameters, and URC models using fully
unconstrained Burkert density profiles. The Bosma models that use the stellar
discs as additional proxies are statistically nearly as good as the URC models
and clearly better than the NFW ones. We thus confirm the correlation between
the centripetal effects of DM and that of the interstellar medium of spiral
galaxies. The edificacy of ""maximal disc"" models is explained as the natural
consequence of ""classic"" Bosma models which include the stellar disc as a proxy
in regions of reduced atomic gas. The standard explanation - that the effect
reflects a statistical correlation between the visible and exotic DM - seems
highly unlikely, given that the geometric forms and hence centripetal
signatures of spherical halo and disc components are so different. A literal
interpretation of the Bosma effect as being due to the presence of significant
amounts of disc DM requires a median visible baryon to disc DM ratio of about
40%.

definitely confirm this statement by a detailed analysis of both the critical

is basically due to the boundary condition which insures that the solutions of

to solutions which carry short-distance singularities presumably regularized by
the string. We suggest that through such solutions - depending on the detailed
dynamics at the string scale - the lost probability may be recovered.

analysis of their spectral functions. At the Hartree-Fock level at least two
stable steady-state solutions with different densities and currents can be
found. By applying a gate voltage-pulse at a given time we are able to switch

sources cannot arrive at the relay with perfect frame and symbol alignments and
the asynchronous multiple-access channel (MAC) should be seriously considered.
Recently, Lu et al. proposed a Tanner-graph representation of the
symbol-asynchronous MAC with rectangular-pulse shaping and further developed
the message-passing algorithm for optimal decoding of the symbol-asynchronous
physical-layer network coding. In this paper, we present a general channel
model for the asynchronous MAC with arbitrary pulse-shaping. Then, the Bahl,
Cocke, Jelinek, and Raviv (BCJR) algorithm is developed for optimal decoding of
the asynchronous MAC channel. For Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-coded BPSK
signalling over the symbol-asynchronous MAC, we present a formal log-domain
generalized sum-product-algorithm (Log-G-SPA) for efficient decoding.
Furthermore, we propose to use cyclic codes for combating the
frame-asynchronism and the resolution of the relative delay inherent in this
approach can be achieved by employing the simple cyclic-redundancy-check (CRC)

Temperature and brightness structures were measured out to the virial radius

around the cluster center to about 3.5 keV at $r_{200}$, with the density
profile well approximated by the $\beta$ model with $\beta = 0.85$. Within
$0.4\r_{200}$, the entropy profile agrees with $r^{1.1}$, as predicted by the
accretion shock model. The entropy slope becomes flatter in the outer region
and negative around $r_{200}$. These features suggest that the intracluster
medium in the outer region is out of thermal equilibrium. Since the relaxation
timescale of electron-ion Coulomb collision is expected to be longer than the
elapsed time after shock heating at $r_{200}$, one plausible reason of the low
entropy is the low electron temperature compared to that of ions. Other
possible explanations would be gas clumpiness, turbulence and bulk motions of
ICM\@. We also searched for a warm-hot intergalactic medium around $r_{200}$

dark energy with observational data. However, the CPL parametrization only
respects the past evolution of dark energy but does not care about the future
evolution of dark energy, since $w(z)$ diverges in the distant future. In a
recent paper [J.Z. Ma and X. Zhang, Phys.\ Lett.\ B {\bf 699}, 233 (2011)], a
robust, novel parametrization for dark energy, $w(z)=w_0+w_1({\ln (2+z)\over
1+z}-\ln2)$, has been proposed, successfully avoiding the future divergence
problem in the CPL parametrization. On the other hand, an oscillating
parametrization (motivated by an oscillating quintom model) can also avoid the
future divergence problem. In this Letter, we use the two divergence-free
parametrizations to probe the dynamics of dark energy in the whole evolutionary
history. In light of the data from 7-year WMAP temperature and polarization
power spectra, matter power spectrum of SDSS DR7, and SN Ia Union2 sample, we
perform a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration for the two dynamical dark
energy models. We find that the best-fit dark energy model is a quintom model
with the EOS across -1 during the evolution. However, though the quintom model
is more favored, we find that the cosmological constant still cannot be
excluded.

motivation of using topos theory to express quantum theory lies in the desire
to overcome certain interpretational problems inherent in the standard

evidence for the sextet sector. These phenomena include (1) Top quark
production is via the eta_6 sextet quark pseudoscalar resonance - interference
with the background will produce an asymmetry. (2) Longitudinal Z pairs,
produced as sextet pions, provide a high mass excess cross-section that
includes the eta_6 at the t-tbar threshold mass. Combining the sextet sector
and the electroweak interaction without short-distance anomalies requires QUD -
a unique underlying weak coupling massless SU(5) gauge theory. Remarkably, it
appears that the Standard Model might be reproduced (in a radical conceptual
change) by the QUD bound-state S-Matrix. Infra-red divergent gauge bosons
coupled to massless fermion anomalies produce a ""wee parton vacuum"" that
confines the elementary fermions. All S-Matrix particles have dynamically

Navier-Stokes equation, augmented by continuity and total energy equations, and
an equation of state describing the relation between the thermodynamic
quantities, is semi-discretized in space by essentially non-oscillatory schemes

time by Runge-Kutta methods which are constructed such as to preserve the total
variation diminishing (or strong stability) property satisfied by the spatial
discretization coupled with the forward Euler method. We analyse the stability,
accuracy and dissipativity of the time integrators and demonstrate that the
most successful methods yield a substantial gain in computational efficiency as

cortical networks have been characterized experimentally to some detail. In
parallel, modeling has been established as a tool to relate network structure
to activity dynamics. While the available connectivity maps have been used in
various computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity
such as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings.
Here, we show that the inconsistency arises from the incompleteness of the
connectivity maps. Our comparison of the most comprehensive maps (Thomson et
al., 2002; Binzegger et al., 2004) reveals their main discrepancies: the
lateral sampling range and the specific selection of target cells. Taking them
into account, we compile an integrated connectivity map and analyze the unified
map by simulations of a full scale model of the local layered cortical network.
The simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and the cell-type
specific spontaneous firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in
awake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. Similarly,
the activation patterns evoked by transient thalamic inputs reproduce recent in
vivo measurements. The correspondence of simulation results and experiments
rests on the consideration of specific target type selection and thereby on the
integration of a large body of the available connectivity data. The cell-type
specific hierarchical input structure and the combination of feed-forward and
feedback connections reveal how the interplay of excitation and inhibition
shapes the spontaneous and evoked activity of the local cortical network.

two-component Ginzburg-Landau (TCGL) theory in three dimensions should support
knot solitons, where the projective equivalence class of the pair of complex

conjecture was motivated by a certain truncation of the TCGL model which
reduced it to the Faddeev-Skyrme model, long known to support knot solitons.
Physically, the truncation amounts to ignoring the coupling between
[psi_1,psi_2] and the supercurrent of the condensates. The current paper
presents a direct test of the validity of this truncation by numerically
tracking the knot solitons as the supercurrent coupling is turned back on. It
is found that the knot solitons shrink and disappear as the true TCGL model is
reached. This undermines the reasoning underlying the conjecture and, when
combined with other negative numerical studies, suggests the conjecture, in its
original form, is very unlikely to be true.

SagittariusA* is, in relative terms, the weakest accreting black hole
accessible to observations. At the moment, the mean SED of SgrA* is only known
reliably in the radio to mm regimes. The goal of this paper is to provide
constraints on the mean emission from SgrA* in the near-to-mid infrared.
Excellent imaging quality was reached in the MIR by using speckle imaging
combined with holographic image reconstruction, a novel technique for this kind
of data. No counterpart of SgrA* is detected at 8.6 microns. At this
wavelength, SgrA* is located atop a dust ridge, which considerably complicates
the search for a potential point source. An observed 3 sigma upper limit of ~10
mJy is estimated for the emission of SgrA* at 8.6 microns, a tighter limit at
this wavelength than in previous work. The de-reddened 3 sigma upper limit,
including the uncertainty of the extinction correction, is ~84 mJy . Based on
the available data, it is argued that, with currently available instruments,
SgrA* cannot be detected in the MIR, not even during flares. At 4.8 and 3.8
microns, on the other hand, SgrA* is detected at all times, at least when
considering timescales of a few up to 13 min. We derive well-defined
time-averaged, de-reddened flux densities of 3.8+-1.3 mJy at 4.8 microns and

transmitted freely, its worth diminishes rapidly in time. In view of recent
developments where internet search engines and other information providers are
offering information to financial institutions, the problem of pricing
information is becoming increasingly important. With this in mind, a new
formulation of utility-indifference argument is introduced and used as a basis
for pricing information. Specifically, we regard information as a quantity that
converts a prior distribution into a posterior distribution. The amount of
information can then be quantified by relative entropy. The key to our utility
indifference argument is to equate the maximised a posterior utility, after
paying certain cost for the information, with the a posterior expectation of
the utility based on the a priori optimal strategy. This formulation leads to
one price for a given quantity of upside information; and another price for a
given quantity of downside information. The ideas are illustrated by means of
simple examples.

use in the description and comprehension of resonance phenomena. We first
discuss the basic Friedrichs model and obtain its resonance in the case that
this is simple or doubly degenerated. Next, we discuss the model with $N$
levels and show how the probability amplitude has an oscillatory behavior. Two
generalizations of the Friedrichs model are suitable to introduce resonance
behavior in quantum field theory. We also discuss a discrete version of the
Friedrichs model and also a resonant interaction between two systems both with
continuous spectrum. In an Appendix, we review the mathematics of rigged
Hilbert spaces.

scattering. We find that the internal lines in Feynman diagrams which
describing the propagation of off-shell bound electrons provide the off-shell
amplitudes of photons' propagation in atoms phenomenally. Our work set up the
connection between the property of Feynman propagators in bound-state QED and
the superluminal but casual propagating behavior of light in atomic media. We
also studied the relation between the bound-state QED and the widely used
light-atom interacting model in quantum optics, and give the experimental
condition where only the bound-state QED is valid.

which allows to disentangle the resulting coupled polynomials without
