to be one of the most important method to detect entanglement in the real
physical world. We first show that an arbitrary entanglement witness (EW) $W$
can be constructed from a separable density matrix $\sigma$ in the form of
$W=\sigma-c_{\sigma} I$, where $c_{\sigma}$ is a non-negative number and $I$ is
the identity matrix. Following the general form of EWs from separable states,
we show a sufficient condition and a sufficient and necessary condition in low
dimensions of that SPAs to positive maps do not define entanglement-breaking
channels. We show that either the SPA of an EW or the SPA of the partial
transposition of the EW in low dimensions is an entanglement-breaking channel.
We give sufficient conditions of violating the SPA conjecture [\emph{Phys. Rev.
A}{\bf 78,} 062105 (2008)]. Our results indicate that the SPA conjecture is
independent of whether or not positive maps are optimal.

types of dark energy models: (i) Generalized holographic and (ii) generalized
Ricci dark energies. The general descriptions of first law and generalized
second law (GSL) of thermodynamics have studied on the apparent horizon,
particle horizon and event horizon of the universe. We have shown that the
first law and GSL are always valid on apparent horizon and first law can not be
satisfied on the particle and event horizons in Einstein's gravity. These
results are always true for any types of dark energy models i.e., these results
do not depend on the dark energy models in Einstein's gravity. But the GSL
completely depends on the choices of dark energy models in Einstein's gravity.
Here we have discussed the validity of GSL in Generalized holographic and
generalized Ricci dark energy models. On the particle horizon GSL may be
satisfied but on the event horizon the GSL can not be satisfied for both the
dark energy models. Also we have considered the Generalized holographic dark
energy and generalized Ricci dark energy as the original holographic dark
energy, so in this situation we have calculated the expression of the radius of
the horizon $L$. On this horizon, we have shown that the first law can not be
satisfied. Finally, on the horizon of radius $L$, we have found that the GSL
can not be satisfied for both the dark energy models.

others. Existing optimization methods are limited to specific constraint sets

magnetic field, numerical simulations have thus far failed to produce any
solution where such a field remains confined against outward diffusion. We
argue that the problem lies in the choice of parameters for which these
numerical simulations have been performed. We construct a simple analytical
magneto-hydrodynamic model of the solar interior and identify several distinct
parameter regimes. For realistic solar parameter values, our results are in
broad agreement with the tachocline model of Gough & McIntyre. In this regime,
meridional flows driven at the base of the convection zone are of sufficient
amplitude to hold back the interior magnetic field against diffusion. For the
parameter values used in existing numerical simulations, on the other hand, we
find that meridional flows are significantly weaker and, we argue, unable to
confine the interior field. We propose a method for selecting parameter values

effect -- arise naturally in many control problems. In its most general form,
the problem of STRIPS planning in unary operator domains is known to be as hard
as the general STRIPS planning problem -- both are PSPACE-complete. However,
unary operator domains induce a natural structure, called the domain's causal
graph. This graph relates between the preconditions and effect of each domain
operator. Causal graphs were exploited by Williams and Nayak in order to
analyze plan generation for one of the controllers in NASA's Deep-Space One
spacecraft. There, they utilized the fact that when this graph is acyclic, a
serialization ordering over any subgoal can be obtained quickly. In this paper
we conduct a comprehensive study of the relationship between the structure of a
domain's causal graph and the complexity of planning in this domain. On the
positive side, we show that a non-trivial polynomial time plan generation
algorithm exists for domains whose causal graph induces a polytree with a
constant bound on its node indegree. On the negative side, we show that even
plan existence is hard when the graph is a directed-path singly connected DAG.
More generally, we show that the number of paths in the causal graph is closely
related to the complexity of planning in the associated domain. Finally we
relate our results to the question of complexity of planning with serializable
subgoals.

approach towards realizing declarative planning systems. In this paper, we
present the language Kc, which extends the declarative planning language K by
action costs. Kc provides the notion of admissible and optimal plans, which are
plans whose overall action costs are within a given limit resp. minimum over
all plans (i.e., cheapest plans). As we demonstrate, this novel language allows
for expressing some nontrivial planning tasks in a declarative way.
Furthermore, it can be utilized for representing planning problems under other
optimality criteria, such as computing ``shortest'' plans (with the least
number of steps), and refinement combinations of cheapest and fastest plans. We
study complexity aspects of the language Kc and provide a transformation to
logic programs, such that planning problems are solved via answer set
programming. Furthermore, we report experimental results on selected problems.
Our experience is encouraging that answer set planning may be a valuable
approach to expressive planning systems in which intricate planning problems
can be naturally specified and solved.

Temperley-Lieb algebra $\TL_k(x)$ as a subalgebra. We prove that for a
particular value of $x$, the algebra $\M_k(x)$ is the centralizer algebra of
$\uqsl$ acting on the $k$-fold tensor power of the sum of the 1-dimensional and
2-dimensional irreducible $\uqsl$-modules. We show that $\M_k(x)$ is generated
by special diagrams $\ell_i, t_i, r_i \ (1 \le i < k)$ and $p_j \ (1 \le j \le
k)$, and that it has a factorization into three subalgebras $\M_k(x) = \RP_k
\TL_k(x)\, \LP_k$, all of which have dimensions given by Catalan numbers. We
define an action of $\M_k(x)$ on Motzkin paths of rank $r$, and in this way,
construct a set of indecomposable modules $\C_k^{(r)}$, $0 \le r \le k$. We
prove that $\M_k(x)$ is cellular in the sense of Graham and Lehrer and that the
$\C_k^{(r)}$ are the left cell representations. We compute the determinant of
the Gram matrix of a bilinear form on $\C_k^{(r)}$ for each $r$ and use these
determinants to show that $\M_k(x)$ is semisimple exactly when $x$ is not the
root of certain Chebyshev polynomials.

time-series photometry in the i-band of the two target galaxies with the Nordic
Optical Telescope (NOT), covering a time span of \approx2.5 years. These data
were then combined with single-epoch K-band photometry, also obtained with the
NOT. Narrow-band photometry data from the literature was used to distinguish
between O-rich and C-rich stars. We report the detection of 513 LPVs in NGC185

ranging between 90 and 800 days. The period-luminosity diagram for each of our

pulsators. The resulting period-luminosity relations we obtained are compared
to relations from the literature. We discuss the universality of those
relations because of which, as a side result, a correction of the distance
modulus of NGC185 may be necessary. Only one of our two galaxies, namely
NGC185, has a significant fraction of possibly first overtone pulsators. An

equivalent cosmological constant that decays in time like $t^{-2p}$, which
avoids the ""fine-tuning"" problem. The power law predicts a simple relation for
the galactic redshift. Comparison with data leads to the speculation that the

The vortex tangle grows and decays, and its lifetime is the era of inflation.
These ideas are implemented in a set of closed cosmological equations that
describe the cosmic expansion driven by the scalar field on the one hand, and
the vortex-matter dynamics on the other. We show how these two aspects decouple
from each other, due to a vast difference in energy scales. The model is not
valid beyond the inflation era, but the universe remains a superfluid

footpoint of the flux rope reconnects with streamer magnetic field lines and
with open field lines from the adjacent coronal hole. It yields an eruption
which has a mix of closed and open twisted field lines due to interchange
reconnection and only one footpoint line-tied to the source region. Even with
the large-scale reconnection, we find no evidence of strong rotation of the CME
as it propagates. We study the CME deflection and find that the effect of the
Lorentz force is a deflection of the CME by about 3 deg/Rsun towards the East

dimming region associated with the reconnection process. We discuss the

emissivity, and discuss the possibility of further improvement. From
observational fitting, we also find a general tendency for the altitude of the
gamma-ray emission region to depend on the inclination angle. In particular,
the emission region for low inclination angle is required to be located in very
low altitude, which corresponds to the inner region within the last-open field
line of rotating dipole in vacuum. This model suggests a modification of
statistics about observed gamma-ray pulsars. Number of the sources with low
inclination and viewing angles increases compared with previous estimate.

tools for quantum physics and the second one for mechanics. The quantum physics
module deals with the photoelectric effect, the radioactive decay of carbon-11,

modules. $\epsilon$-interleavings induce a pseudometric $d_I$ on (isomorphism
classes of) persistence modules, the interleaving distance. The definitions of
$\epsilon$-interleavings and $d_I$ generalize readily to multidimensional
persistence modules. In this paper, we develop the theory of multidimensional
interleavings, with a view towards applications to topological data analysis.
We present four main results. First, we show that on 1-D persistence modules,
$d_I$ is equal to the bottleneck distance $d_B$. This result, which first
appeared in an earlier preprint of this paper, has since appeared in several
other places, and is now known as the isometry theorem. Second, we present a
characterization of the $\epsilon$-interleaving relation on multidimensional
persistence modules. This expresses transparently the sense in which two
$\epsilon$-interleaved modules are algebraically similar. Third, using this
characterization, we show that when we define our persistence modules over a
prime field, $d_I$ satisfies a universality property. This universality result
is the central result of the paper. It says that $d_I$ satisfies a stability
property generalizing one which $d_B$ is known to satisfy, and that in
addition, if $d$ is any other pseudometric on multidimensional persistence
modules satisfying the same stability property, then $d\leq d_I$. We also show
that a variant of this universality result holds for $d_B$, over arbitrary
fields. Finally, we show that $d_I$ restricts to a metric on isomorphism
classes of finitely presented multidimensional persistence modules.

on the basis of the micropolar fluid model. Uniform mean shear field and mean
spin field, which is not subordinate to the vorticity field, are realized in
the simulations. The estimates of stresses based on kinetic theory by Lun [Lun,
J. Fluid Mech., 1991, 233, 539] are in good agreement with the simulation
results for a low area fraction $\nu=0.1$ but the agreement becomes weaker as
the area fraction gets higher. However, the estimates in the kinetic theory can
be fitted to the simulation results up to $\nu=0.7$ by renormalizing the
coefficient of roughness. For a relatively dense granular flow ($\nu=0.8$), the
simulation results are also compared with Kanatani's theory [Kanatani, Int. J.

decomposition into the constitutive equations in Kanatani's theory are not

generation of charge and spin current respectively near the surface of a metal
making a transition to the superconducting state. The Meissner effect is well
known but, I argue, not explained by the conventional theory, the Spin Meissner
effect has yet to be detected. I propose that both effects take place in all
superconductors, the first one in the presence of an applied magnetostatic
field, the second one even in the absence of applied external fields. Both
effects can be understood under the assumption that electrons expand their
orbits and thereby lower their quantum kinetic energy in the transition to
superconductivity. Associated with this process, the metal expels negative
charge from the interior to the surface and an electric field is generated in
the interior. The resulting charge current can be understood as arising from
the magnetic Lorentz force on radially outgoing electrons, and the resulting
spin current can be understood as arising from a spin Hall effect originating
in the Rashba-like coupling of the electron magnetic moment to the internal
electric field. The associated electrodynamics is qualitatively different from
London electrodynamics, yet can be described by a small modification of the
conventional London equations. The stability of the superconducting state and
its macroscopic phase coherence hinge on the fact that the orbital angular
momentum of the carriers of the spin current is found to be exactly $\hbar/2$,
indicating a topological origin. The simplicity and universality of our theory
argue for its validity, and the occurrence of superconductivity in many classes
of materials can be understood within our theory.

resources of a single malicious user. Researchers have long known about the
existence of Sybil accounts in online communities such as file-sharing systems,
but have not been able to perform large scale measurements to detect them or
measure their activities. In this paper, we describe our efforts to detect,
characterize and understand Sybil account activity in the Renren online social
network (OSN). We use ground truth provided by Renren Inc. to build measurement
based Sybil account detectors, and deploy them on Renren to detect over 100,000
Sybil accounts. We study these Sybil accounts, as well as an additional 560,000
Sybil accounts caught by Renren, and analyze their link creation behavior. Most
interestingly, we find that contrary to prior conjecture, Sybil accounts in
OSNs do not form tight-knit communities. Instead, they integrate into the
social graph just like normal users. Using link creation timestamps, we verify
that the large majority of links between Sybil accounts are created
accidentally, unbeknownst to the attacker. Overall, only a very small portion
of Sybil accounts are connected to other Sybils with social links. Our study
shows that existing Sybil defenses are unlikely to succeed in today's OSNs, and
we must design new techniques to effectively detect and defend against Sybil
attacks.

assumptions about the geometry of the disks and involving different sets of
emission lines into the fitting, under the assumption of thin flat disk
circular rotation, we obtain the full possible range of angle between the disks

the external gas accretion from a satellite, orbiting the host galaxy with a
corresponding angular momentum direction. The published data on the HI
distribution around NGC 7743 suggest that the galaxy has a gas-rich
environment. The emission-line ratio diagrams imply the domination of shock
waves in the ionization state of the gaseous disk, whereas the contribution of
photoionization by recent star formation seems to be negligible. In some parts
of the disk a difference between the velocities of the gas emitting in the
forbidden lines and in the Balmer lines is detected. It may be caused by the
fact that the inclined disk is mainly shock-excited, whereas some fraction of
the Balmer-line emission is produced by a small amount of gas excited by young
stars in the main stellar disk of NGC 7743. In the circumnuclear region (R< 200

Bose-Einstein condensates with the self-attractive intrinsic nonlinearity. Each
condensate is trapped in a combination of in-plane and transverse
harmonic-oscillator potentials. It is shown that, depending on the
self-interaction strength and tunneling coupling, the ground state of the
system exhibits a phase transition which links three configurations: a
symmetric one with equal numbers of atoms in the coupled condensates, an
asymmetric configuration with a population imbalance (a manifestation of the
macroscopic quantum self-trapping), and the collapsing state. A modification of
the phase diagram of the system in the presence of vortices in the disk-shaped
condensates is reported too. The study of dynamics around the stationary
configurations reveals properties which strongly depend on the symmetry of the
configuration.

of the su(n) WZNW fusion ring by C. Stroppel and the author. It contains one
novel aspect: the explicit derivation of an algorithm for the computation of
fusion coefficients different from the Kac-Walton formula. The discussion is
presented from the point of view of a vertex model in statistical mechanics
whose partition function generates the fusion coefficients. The statistical
model can be shown to be integrable by linking its transfer matrix to a
particular solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. This transfer matrix can be
identified with the generating function of an (infinite) set of polynomials in
a noncommutative alphabet: the generators of the local affine plactic algebra.
The latter is a generalisation of the plactic algebra occurring in the context
of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence. One can define analogues of Schur
polynomials in this noncommutative alphabet which become identical to the
fusion matrices when represented as endomorphisms over the state space of the
integrable model. Crucial is the construction of an eigenbasis, the Bethe
vectors, which are the idempotents of the fusion algebra.

We identify the conditions for physical walls where the stationary velocity

randomly varying parts. The properties of a target are described by a random
process known as the spreading function. Its second order statistics under the
WSSUS assumption are given by the scattering function. Recent developments in
the operator identification theory suggest a channel sounding procedure that
allows to determine the spreading function given complete statistical knowledge
of the operator echo. We show that in a continuous model it is indeed
theoretically possible to identify a scattering function of an overspread
target given full statistics of a received echo from a single sounding by a
custom weighted delta train. Our results apply whenever the scattering function
is supported on a set of area less than one. Absent such complete statistics,
we construct and analyze an estimator that can be used as a replacement of the

late spectral subtype (WNh stars). In previous theoretical studies the enhanced
mass loss of these stars has been attributed to their proximity to the
Eddington limit. Here we investigate observed trends in the mass-loss
properties of such young, very massive stars. We derive theoretical
mass-luminosity relations for very massive stars, based on a large grid of
stellar structure models. Using these relations, we estimate Eddington factors
for a sample of stars, under different assumptions of their evolutionary
status. We evaluate the resulting mass-loss relations, and compare them with
theoretical predictions. We find observational evidence that the mass loss in
the WR regime is dominated by the Eddington parameter Gamma_e, which has
important consequences for the way we understand Wolf-Rayet stars and their
mass loss. In addition, we derive wind masses that support the picture that the
WNh stars in young stellar clusters are very massive, hydrogen-burning stars.
Our findings suggest that the proximity to the Eddington limit is the physical
reason for the onset of Wolf-Rayet type mass loss. This means that, e.g. in
stellar evolution models, the Wolf-Rayet stage should be identified by large
Eddington parameters, instead of a helium-enriched surface composition. The
latter is most likely only a consequence of strong mass loss, in combination
with internal mixing. For very massive stars, the enhanced Gamma-dependent mass
loss is responsible for the formation of late WNh subtypes with high hydrogen
surface abundances, partly close to solar. Because mass loss dominates the
evolution of very massive stars, we expect a strong impact of this effect on
their end products, in particular on the potential formation of black holes,
and Gamma-Ray Bursts, as well as the observed upper mass limit of stars.

are investigated for surveys where the polarization information is obtained
from RM synthesis. Considering unresolved sources with a single rotation
measure, a detection threshold of $8 \sigma_{QU}$ applied to the Faraday
spectrum will retrieve the RM with a false detection rate less than $10^{-4}$,
but polarized intensity is more strongly biased than Ricean statistics suggest.
For a detection threshold of $5 \sigma_{QU}$, the false detection rate
increases to ~4%, depending also on $\lambda^2$ coverage and the extent of the
Faraday spectrum. Non-Gaussian noise in Stokes Q and U due to imperfect imaging
and calibration can be represented by a distribution that is the sum of a
Gaussian and an exponential. The non-Gaussian wings of the noise distribution
increase the false detection rate in polarized intensity by orders of
magnitude. Monte-Carlo simulations assuming non-Gaussian noise in Q and U, give
false detection rates at $8 \sigma_{QU}$ similar to Ricean false detection
rates at $4.9 \sigma_{QU}$.

rapidly rotating A-type star Vega, we concentrate here on the bright star
Sirius A, taken as a prototypical, chemically peculiar, moderately rotating Am
star. We employed the NARVAL and ESPaDOnS high-resolution spectropolarimeters
to collect 442 circularly polarized spectra, complemented by 60 linearly
polarized spectra. Using a list of about 1,100 photospheric spectral lines, we
computed a cross correlation line profile from every spectrum, leading to a
signal-to-noise ratio of up to 30,000 in the polarized profile. We report the
repeated detection of circularly polarized, highly asymmetric signatures in the
line profiles, interpreted as Zeeman signatures of a large-scale photospheric
magnetic field, with a line-of-sight component equal to $0.2 \pm 0.1$ G. This
is the first polarimetric detection of a surface magnetic field on an Am star.
Using rough estimates of the physical properties of the upper layers of Sirius
A, we suggest that a dynamo operating in the shallow convective envelope cannot
account for the field strength reported here. Together with the magnetic field
of Vega, this result confirms that a new class of magnetic objects exists among
non Ap/Bp intermediate-mass stars, and it may indicate that a significant
fraction of tepid stars are magnetic.

at each receiver that cannot be aligned. Each receiver detects and cancels the
residual interference based on the constellation map. However, there is a
window of unfavorable interference profile at the receiver for Interference

create a favorable interference profile for ID at each receiver. We first
derive the average symbol error rate (SER) by taking into account of the

surface density profile, a flat or rising velocity dispersion profile and a low

luminous elliptical galaxies; the core expands due to the combined effects of
heating from dynamical friction of sinking massive black holes and AGN feedback
that ejects gaseous material from the central regions.

important role when it comes to the influence of matter fields. In particular,
both the chosen gauge group and the representation of the matter fields yield
structural differences in the quenched case. Especially, the qualitative
behavior of the Wilson potential is strongly dependent on this selection.
Though the algebraic reasons for this observation is clear, it is far from
obvious how this behavior can be described besides using numerical simulations.
Herein, it is investigated how the group structure appears in the
Dyson-Schwinger equations, which as a hierarchy of equations for the
correlation functions have to be satisfied. It is found that there are
differences depending on both the gauge group and the representation of the
matter fields. This provides insight into possible truncation schemes for
practical calculations using these equations.

envelopes may differ from their older counterparts, but are historically
difficult to study because emission from a disk can be confused with envelope
or outflow emission. CO fundamental emission is a potentially powerful probe of
the disk/wind structure within a few AU of young protostars. In this paper, we
present high spectral (R=90,000) and spatial (0.3"") resolution VLT/CRIRES
M-band spectra of 18 low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) with dense envelopes
in nearby star-froming regions to explore the utility of CO fundamental 4.6
micron emission as a probe of very young disks. CO fundamental emission is
detected from 14 of the YSOs in our sample. The emission line profiles show a
range of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad,
warm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected
more frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 Lsun than those
with >15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm
(~1000 K) inner AU of the disk. The CO emission from objects with high
bolometric luminosity is produced in cooler (~320 K), narrow lines in 12CO and
in rarer isotopologues. From some objects, the narrow lines are blueshifted by
up to ~10 km/s, indicating a slow wind origin. For other sources the lines are
located at the systemic velocity of the star and likely arise in the disk. For
a few YSOs, spatially-extended CO and H2 S(9) emission is detected up to 2""
from the central source and is attributed to interactions between the wind and
surrounding molecular material. Warm CO absorption is detected in the wind of
six objects with velocities up to 100 km/s, often in discrete velocity
components. That the wind is partially molecular where it is launched favors
ejection in a disk wind rather than a coronal or chromospheric wind.

spanning the viscous sublayer to the channel flow centerline, for friction
Reynolds numbers $Re_\tau = 180$ and $Re_\tau = 381$. The high resolution of
the simulations allows dissipation and enstrophy moments up to fourth order to

number effects are observed at the edge of the logarithmic layer. Conditional
analyses based on locations of intense rotation are also carried out in order

is between initially ingoing particle that turns back as an outgoing particle

two massless particles are produced in such a collision and their angular
distribution is isotropic in the center of mass frame. We calculate the escape

We show how to relate the observable multiplicity function in surveys with
similar host-star populations but different sensitivities. We also show how to
correct for geometrical selection effects to derive the multiplicity function
from transit surveys if the distribution of relative inclinations is known.
Applying these tools to the Kepler transit survey and radial-velocity surveys,
we find that (i) the Kepler data alone do not constrain the mean inclination of
multi-planet systems; even spherical distributions are allowed by the data but
only if a small fraction of host stars contain large planet populations (> 30);
(ii) comparing the Kepler and radial-velocity surveys shows that the mean
inclination of multi-planet systems lies in the range 0-5 degrees; (iii) the
multiplicity function of the Kepler planets is not well-determined by the
present data.

range of structures when the two species individually form aggregates of
different curvatures. In this paper, we focus on small, spherically-symmetric
aggregates in a solution of sphere-forming amphiphile mixed with a smaller
amount of lamella-forming amphiphile. Using a coarse-grained mean-field model
(self-consistent field theory, or SCFT), we scan the parameter space of this
system and find a range of morphologies as the interaction strength,
architecture and mixing ratio of the amphiphiles are varied. When the two
species are quite similar in architecture, or when only a small amount of
lamella-former is added, we find simple spherical micelles with cores formed
from a mixture of the hydrophobic blocks of the two amphiphiles. For more
strongly mismatched amphiphiles and higher lamella-former concentrations, we
instead find small vesicles and more complex micelles. In these latter
structures, the lamella-forming species is encapsulated by the sphere-forming
one. For certain interaction strengths and lamella-former architectures, the
amount of lamella-forming copolymer encapsulated may be large, and the
implications of this for the solubilization of hydrophobic chemicals are
considered. The mechanisms behind the formation of the above structures are
discussed, with a particular emphasis on the sorting of amphiphiles according
to their preferred curvature.

(shear horizontal) elastic waves in periodically stratified solids. The problem
consists of an ordinary differential wave equation with periodic coefficients,
which involves two free parameters $\omega $ (the frequency) and $k$ (the
wavenumber in the direction orthogonal to the axis of periodicity). Solutions
of this equation satisfy a quasi-periodic boundary condition which yields the
Floquet parameter $K$. The resulting dispersion surface $\omega (K,k)$ may be
characterized through its cuts at constant values of $K, k$ and $\omega $ that
define the passband (real $K$) and stopband areas, the Floquet branches and the
isofrequency curves, respectively. The paper combines complementary approaches
based on eigenvalue problems and on the monodromy matrix $\mathbf{M}$. The
pivotal object is the Lyapunov function $\Delta (\omega ^{2},k^{2}) \equiv
1/2\mathrm{trace}\mathbf{M}=\cos K$ which is generalized as a function of two
variables. Its analytical properties, asymptotics and bounds are examined and
an explicit form of its derivatives obtained. Attention is given to the special
case of a zero-width stopband. These ingredients are used to analyze the cuts
of the surface $\omega (K,k).$ The derivatives of the functions $\omega (k)$ at
fixed $K$ and $\omega (K)$ at fixed $k$ and of the function $K(k)$ at fixed
$\omega $ are described in detail. The curves $\omega (k)$ at fixed $K$ are
shown to be monotonic for real $K,$ while they may be looped for complex $K$
(i.e. in the stopband areas). The convexity of the closed (first) real
isofrequency curve $K(k)$ is proved thus ruling out low-frequency caustics of
group velocity. The results are relevant to the broad area of applicability of
ordinary differential equation for scalar waves in 1D phononic (solid or fluid)

block copolymers in dilute solution, where self-assembly is triggered by
changing the solvent from the common good solvent THF to the selective solvent
water, and where the two species on their own in water form vesicles and
spherical micelles respectively. We find that in water the inter-micellar
exchange of these block copolymers is very slow so that the self-assembled
structures are in local but not global equilibrium (i.e., they are
non-ergodic). This opens up the possibility of controlling micelle morphology
both thermodynamically and kinetically. Specifically, when the two species are
first dissolved in THF before mixing and self-assembly (`premixing') by
dilution with water, the morphology is found to depend on the mixing ratio of
the two species, going gradually from vesicles via `bulbed' rods, rings,
Y-junctions and finally to spherical micelles as we increase the proportion of
the sphere-formers. On the other hand, if the two species are first partially
self-assembled (by partial exchange of the solvent with water) before mixing
and further self-assembly (`intermediate mixing'), novel metastable structures,
including nanoscopic pouches, emerge. These experimental results are
corroborated by self-consistent field theory calculations (SCFT) which
reproduce the sequence of morphologies seen in the pre-mixing experiments. SCFT
also reveals a clear coupling between polymer composition and aggregate
curvature, with regions of positive and negative curvature being stabilized by
an enrichment and depletion of sphere formers respectively. Our study
demonstrates that both thermodynamic and kinetic blending of block copolymers
are effective design parameters to control the resulting structures and allow
us to access a much richer range of nano-morphologies than is possible with
monomodal block copolymer solutions.

nesting numbers in permutations of type B. More precisely, we prove a Bn-
analogue of the symmetric distribution of crossings and nestings of
permutations due to Corteel (Adv. in Appl. Math., 38(2)(2007), 149-163) as well
as the sym- metric distribution of k-crossings and k-nestings of permutations
due to Burrill et al. (DMTCS proc. AN, (2010), 461-468).

solutions is investigated. Through thermodynamic arguments for the
interpenetration of polymer segments and the free energy change, we show that
the disappearance of the excluded volume effects should occur at medium
concentration. The result is in accord with the recent experimental
observations.

in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields inside and outside the
horizon, the holographic energy density is modified accordingly. In this paper
we study the power-law entropy-corrected holographic dark energy in the
framework of Brans-Dicke theory. We investigate the cosmological implications
of this model in detail. We also perform the study for the new agegraphic dark
energy model and calculate some relevant cosmological parameters and their
evolution. {As a result we find that this model can provide the present cosmic
acceleration and even the equation of state parameter of this model can cross
the phantom line $w_D=-1$ provided the model parameters are chosen suitably}.
