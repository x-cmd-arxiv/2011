of a peculiar supersymmetric gauge theory on the worldvolume of multiple M2s
branes as a boundary field theory. Under suitable conditions the quantum theory
becomes a noncommutative supersymmetric YM-CS gauge theory which call for an
study of its renormalized perturbative corrections. As a preliminary step to
more general consideration, the modification of the ${\cal N}=3,2,1$
supersymmetric YM-CS gauge theory due to noncommutativity of spatial
coordinates is proposed. We carry out the one-loop renormalization and a
noncommutative correction for the Chern-Simons coefficient is obtained. Finally
it is found that this new correction depends of the noncommutative parameter in
an analytic form.

membranes with negligible spontaneous curvature. At small droplet volume,
bending energy dominates and the droplet is only partially wrapped by the
membrane. At large volume, this configuration can become unstable and undergo a
discontinuous transition to a state, in which the droplet is (almost)
completely wrapped by the membrane. A morphology diagram, showing the parameter
region where such budding transition occurs, is constructed as a function of
the membrane tension and the intrinsic contact angle of the liquid with the
membrane. The effects of spontaneous curvature are discussed qualitatively.

based on Threaded Objects (or Active Objects), which offer great flexibility in
simulating the complex behavior of distributed data processing programs. The
engine provides an appropriate scheduling mechanism for the Active objects with
support for interrupts. This approach offers a natural way of describing
complex running programs that are data dependent and which concurrently compete
for shared resources as well as large numbers of concurrent data transfers on
shared resources. The framework provides a complete set of basic components

gamma-ray flare per year, becoming the most active gamma-ray blazar in the sky.
We present for the first time the multi-wavelength AGILE, SWIFT, INTEGRAL, and
GASP-WEBT data collected in order to explain the extraordinary gamma-ray flare
of 3C 454.3 which occurred in November 2010. On 2010 November 20 (MJD 55520),
3C 454.3 reached a peak flux (E>100 MeV) of F_gamma(p) = (6.8+-1.0)E-5 ph/cm2/s
on a time scale of about 12 hours, more than a factor of 6 higher than the flux
of the brightest steady gamma-ray source, the Vela pulsar, and more than a
factor of 3 brighter than its previous super-flare on 2009 December 2-3. The
multi-wavelength data make a thorough study of the present event possible: the
comparison with the previous outbursts indicates a close similarity to the one
that occurred in 2009. By comparing the broadband emission before, during, and
after the gamma-ray flare, we find that the radio, optical and X-ray emission
varies within a factor 2-3, whereas the gamma-ray flux by a factor of 10. This
remarkable behavior is modeled by an external Compton component driven by a
substantial local enhancement of soft seed photons.

nanoparticles size with concentration which modifies the microstructure and the
average roughness of the surface. Under co-deposition, P3HT largely retains its
conjugated structures, which is evidenced by the similar XPS and UPS spectra to
those of P3HT films deposited on other substrates. We demonstrate here that the
magnitude of the barrier height for hole injection and the position of the

controlled and changed by adjusting the metal (Ag) content in the composite.
Furthermore, UPS reveals distinct features related to the C 2p (Sigma states)

perpendicularly-aligned Single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) forests were
realized on Nafion modified substrates via Fe3+ assisted self-assembly.
Infrared spectroscopy (IR), atomic force microscopy (AFM) profilometry and
contact angle measurements indicated that low-energy electron-beam cleaved the
hydrophilic side chains (-SO3H and C-O-C) of Nafion to low molecular byproducts
that sublimed in the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) environment exposing the
hydrophobic Nafion backbone. Auger mapping and AFM microscopy affirmed that the
exposed hydrophobic domains absorbed considerably less Fe3+ ions upon exposure
to pH 2.2 aqueous FeCl3 solution, which yield considerably less FeO(OH)/FeOCl
precipitates (FeO(OH) in majority) upon washing with lightly basic DMF solution
containing trace amounts of adsorbed moisture. Such differential deposition of
FeO(OH)/FeOCl precipitates provided the basis for the patterned site-specific
self-assembly of SWNT forests as demonstrated by AFM and resonance Raman
spectroscopy.

atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes with the help of dielectrophoresis (DEP).
This process involved the application of a 10 V, 2 MHz, AC bias between a
metal-coated AFM probe and a dilute suspension of SWNTs. This exerted a
positive dielectrophoretic force onto the nanotubes that caused them to align
while precipitating out onto the probe. The gradual removal of the AFM probe
away from the SWNT suspension consolidated these nanotubes into nanofibrils
with a high degree of alignment as demonstrated with polarization Raman
experiments. By varying the pulling speed, immersion time, and concentration of
the SWNT suspension, one can tailor the diameter and thus the stiffness of
these probes. Precise length trimming of these nanofibrils was also performed
by their gradual immersion and dissolution into a liquid that strongly
interacted with nanotubes, (i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution).
Vacuum annealing these nanoprobes at temperature up to 450 degree C further
increased their stiffness and rendered them insoluble to SDS and all other
aqueous media. Regrowth of a new SWNT nanofibril from the side or at the end of
a previously grown SWNT nanofibril was also demonstrated by a repeated
dielectrophoretic assembly at the desired immersion depth. These SWNT
nanofibril-equipped AFM probes are electrically conductive and mechanically
robust for use as high-aspect-ratio electrochemical nanoprobes.

all parent compounds of cuprates that share a common antiferromagnetically (AF)

effective magnetic model. This model captures three incommensurate magnetic
phases, two of which have been observed experimentally. The model characterizes
the nature of phase transitions between the different magnetic phases and
explains a variety of magnetic properties, such as spin-wave spectra and
electronic nematism. Most importantly, by unifying the understanding of
magnetism, we cast new insight on the key ingredients of magnetic interactions
which are critical to the occurrence of superconductivity.

Paterson for deterministic consensus protocols in the aynchronous model with
just one failure, Ben-Or and Bracha demonstrated that the problem could be
solved with randomness, even for Byzantine failures. Both protocols are natural
and intuitive to verify, and Bracha's achieves optimal resilience. However, the
expected running time of these protocols is exponential in general. Recently,
Kapron, Kempe, King, Saia, and Sanwalani presented the first efficient
Byzantine agreement algorithm in the asynchronous, full information model,
running in polylogarithmic time. Their algorithm is Monte Carlo and drastically
departs from the simple structure of Ben-Or and Bracha's Las Vegas algorithms.
  In this paper, we begin an investigation of the question: to what extent is
this departure necessary? Might there be a much simpler and intuitive Las Vegas
protocol that runs in expected polynomial time? We will show that the
exponential running time of Ben-Or and Bracha's algorithms is no mere accident
of their specific details, but rather an unavoidable consequence of their
general symmetry and round structure. We define a natural class of ""fully
symmetric round protocols"" for solving Byzantine agreement in an asynchronous
setting and show that any such protocol can be forced to run in expected
exponential time by an adversary in the full information model. We assume the
adversary controls $t$ Byzantine processors for $t = cn$, where $c$ is an
arbitrary positive constant $< 1/3$. We view our result as a step toward
identifying the level of complexity required for a polynomial-time algorithm in
this setting, and also as a guide in the search for new efficient algorithms.

arises from the warm surface region of the circumstellar disk. We explore the
use of the new BT2 (Barber et al. 2006) water line list in fitting the spectra,
and we find that it does a much better job than the well-known HITRAN (Rothman
et al. 1998) water line list in the observed wavelength range and for the warm
temperatures probed by our data. By comparing the observed spectra with
synthetic disk emission models, we find that the water and OH emission lines
have similar widths (FWHM ~ 18 km s-1). If the line widths are set by disk
rotation, the OH and water emission lines probe a similar range of disk radii
in this source. The water and OH emission are consistent with thermal emission
for both components at a temperature ~ 1500 K. The column densities of the
emitting water and OH are large, ~ 10^{21} cm-2 and ~ 10^{20} cm-2,
respectively. Such a high column density of water is more than adequate to
shield the disk midplane from external UV irradiation in the event of complete
dust settling out of the disk atmosphere, enabling chemical synthesis to
continue in the midplane despite a harsh external UV environment. The large
OH-to-water ratio is similar to expectations for UV irradiated disks (e.g.,

With respect to dynamic range and noise stability, BLOOMP is the best
performer. With respect to sparsity, BLOOMP is the best performer for high

similar radius. As with the initial black string, each local string segment is
itself unstable, and this fuels the self-similar cascade to (classically)
arbitrarily small scales; in the process the horizon develops a fractal
structure. In finite asymptotic time, the remaining string segments shrink to
zero-size, yielding a naked singularity. Since no fine-tuning is required to
excite the instability, this constitutes a generic violation of cosmic
censorship. We further discuss how this behavior is related to satellite
formation in low-viscosity fluid streams subject to the Rayleigh-Plateau
instability, and estimate the fractal dimension of the horizon prior to

cooling and AGN heating are both important in shaping the Lx-Tvir relation but
on different length-scales. While our study indicates that ICM cooling
dominates on cluster scales (Tvir > 2.5keV), we speculate that AGN heating
dominates the scaling relation in poor clusters and groups (Tvir < 2.5keV). The
intrinsic scatter about the Lx-Tvir relation in X-ray luminosity for the whole
sample is 45.4% and varies from a minimum of 34.8% for weak cool-core clusters
to a maximum of 59.4% for clusters with no central radio source. We find that
after excising the cooling region, the scatter in the Lx-Tvir relation drops
from 45.4% to 39.1%, implying that the cooling region contributes ~ 27% to the
overall scatter. Lastly, we find the true SCC fraction to be 25% lower than the
observed one and the true normalizations of the Lx-Tvir relations to be lower
by 12%, 7%, and 17% for SCC, WCC, and NCC clusters, respectively. [abridged]

to quantify infectious diseases continue to lag behind. There exists a need to
create more CAD systems capable of detecting and quantifying characteristic
patterns often seen in respiratory tract infections such as influenza,
bacterial pneumonia, or tuborculosis. One of such patterns is Tree-in-bud (TIB)
which presents \textit{thickened} bronchial structures surrounding by clusters
of \textit{micro-nodules}. Automatic detection of TIB patterns is a challenging
task because of their weak boundary, noisy appearance, and small lesion size.
In this paper, we present two novel methods for automatically detecting TIB
patterns: (1) a fast localization of candidate patterns using information from
local scale of the images, and (2) a M\""{o}bius invariant feature extraction
method based on learned local shape and texture properties. A comparative
evaluation of the proposed methods is presented with a dataset of 39 laboratory
confirmed viral bronchiolitis human parainfluenza (HPIV) CTs and 21 normal lung

high detection rate with an overall accuracy of 90.96%.

enables the experimenter to gain additional information beyond the standard

recent analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of localized modes
trapped in 1D and 2D double-well nonlinear potentials (also known as
pseudopotentials), we aim to find 2D solitons in the two-circle setting, using
numerical methods and the variational approximation (VA). Well-separated
circles support stable symmetric and antisymmetric solitons. The decrease of
separation L between the circles leads to destabilization of the solitons. The
symmetric modes undergo two SSB transitions. First, they are transformed into
weakly asymmetric breathers, which is followed by a transition to single-peak
modes trapped in one circle. The antisymmetric solitons perform a direct
transition to the single-peak mode. The symmetric solitons are described
reasonably well by the VA. For touching (L=0) and overlapping (L<0) circles,
single-peak solitons are found-asymmetric ones, trapped in either circle, and
symmetric solitons centered at the midpoint of the bi-circle configuration. If
the overlap is weak, the symmetric soliton is unstable. It may spontaneously
leap into either circle and perform shuttle motion in it. A region of stability
of the symmetric solitons appears with the increase of the overlap degree. In
the case of a moderately strong overlap, another SSB effect is found, in the
form of a pair of symmetry-breaking and restoring bifurcations which link
families of the symmetric and asymmetric solitons.

  A set of geotags is used to compute a location similarity model between two

number of users that have visited both places, using a Gaussian density
estimation of the co-occurrence space of location visits to cluster related
geotags. The standard deviation of the kernel can be used as a scale parameter
that determines the size of the recommended landmarks.
  A personalised recommendation based on the location similarity model is
evaluated on city and country scale and is able to outperform a location
ranking based on popularity. Especially when a tourist filter based on visit
duration is enforced, the prediction can be accurately adapted to the
preference of the user. An extensive evaluation based on manual annotations
shows that more strict ranking methods like cosine similarity and a proposed
RankDiff algorithm provide more serendipitous recommendations and are able to
link similar locations on opposite sides of the world.

self-gravity come into play, a weak bump-like structure at the gap edge appears
in the near-infrared (NIR) scattered light, while no such bump-like structure
is seen in the sub-mm dust continuum image. The appearance of the bump is
caused by the variation of the height of the surface in the NIR wavelength. If
such bump-like feature is detected in future direct imaging observations, with
the combination of sub-mm observations, it will bring us useful information

momentum (where the spin is irrelevant), and neither space inversion nor time
reversal is a symmetry operation for an alkali atom. In fact, the famous
Runge-Lenz vector M is simply the permanent EDM vector of an alkali atom. As
early as 1926, W. Pauli calculated the energy levels of the hydrogen using the
vector M. Therefore, our work may fall into the category of the most exciting
discoveries during the past few decades.

purity of better than 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) to allow the ionised
electrons to drift without significant capture by any electronegative
impurities. We present a comprehensive study of the effects of electronegative
impurity on gaseous and liquid argon scintillation light, an analysis of the
efficacy of various purification chemicals, as well as the Liverpool LAr setup,
which utilises a novel re-circulation purification system. Of the impurities
tested - Air, O_2, H_2O, N_2 and CO_2 in the range of between 0.01 ppm to 1000
ppm - H_2O was found to have the most profound effect on gaseous argon
scintillation light, and N_2 was found to have the least. Additionally, a
correlation between the slow component decay time and the total energy
deposited with 0.01 ppm - 100 ppm O_2 contamination levels in liquid argon has
been established. The superiority of molecular sieves over anhydrous complexes
at absorbing Ar gas, N_2 gas and H_2O vapour has been quantified using BET
isotherm analysis. The efficiency of Cu and P_2O5 at removing O_2 and H_2O
impurities from 1 bar N6 argon gas at both room temperature and -130 ^oC was
investigated and found to be high. A novel, highly scalable LAr re-circulation
system has been developed. The complete system, consisting of a motorised
bellows pump operating in liquid and a purification cartridge, were designed
and built in-house. The system was operated successfully over many days and
achieved a re-circulation rate of 27 litres/hour and high purity.

fluid dynamic fields, as they can arise in heavy ion collisions from the

Bjorken flow are found to be governed by non-linear equations whose solutions
can be characterized qualitatively in terms of Reynolds numbers. Perturbations
at different rapidities decouple quickly, and satisfy (after suitable
coordinate transformations) an effectively two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equation of non-relativistic form. We discuss the conditions under which
non-linearities in these equations cannot be neglected and turbulent behavior
is expected to set in.

niceness conditions discussed in the literature. A key feature of the model is
that the Hilbert space of black hole internal states contains a vacuum state
corresponding to the completely evaporated black hole, which can be reached
from any initial state via the Hawking process. Our model suggests a novel
quantum cosmological way in which information can get out of an evaporating
black hole.

interference channels for delay-tolerant data services. In doing so, we utilize
a game theoretic framework with novel constraints, where each user tries to
maximize its utility in a distributed and opportunistic manner, while
satisfying the game's constraints by adapting its transmit power to its
channel. In this scheme, users transmit with more power on good sub-channels
and do the opposite on bad sub-channels. In this way, in addition to the
allocated power on each sub-channel, the total power of all users also depends
on channel conditions. Since each user's power level depends on power levels of
other users, the game belongs to the \emph{generalized} Nash equilibrium (GNE)
problems, which in general, is hard to analyze. We show that the proposed game
has a GNE, and derive the sufficient conditions for its uniqueness. Besides, we
propose a new pricing scheme for maximizing each user's throughput in an
opportunistic manner under its total power constraint; and provide the
sufficient conditions for the algorithm's convergence and its GNE's uniqueness.
Simulations confirm that our proposed scheme yields a higher throughput for
each user and/or has a significantly improved efficiency as compared to other
existing opportunistic methods.

colloidal hard spheres in an external uniaxial AC electric field.
Experimentally, the external field induces dipole moments in the colloidal
particles, which in turn form chains. We therefore approximate the system as
composed of well formed chains of dipolar hard spheres of a uniform length. The
dipolar interaction between colloidal spheres gives rise to an effective
interaction between the chains, which we treat as disks in a plane, that
includes a short range attraction and long range repulsion. Hence, the system
favors finite clustering over bulk phase separation and indeed we observe at
low temperature and density that the system does form a cluster phase. As
density increases, percolation is accompanied by a pressure anomaly. The
percolated phase, despite being composed of connected, locally crystalline
domains, does not bear the typical signatures of a hexatic phase. At very low
densities, we find no indication of a ""void phase"" with a cellular structure
seen recently in experiments.

the scalar fields have been done in the literature by establishing a connection
between holographic/agegraphic energy density and a scalar field model of dark
energy. However, in most of these cases the analytical form of the potentials
in terms of the scalar field have not been reconstructed due to the complexity
of the equations involved. In this paper, by taking Hubble radius as system's
IR cutoff, we are able to reconstruct the analytical form of the potentials as
a function of scalar field, namely $V=V(\phi)$ as well as the dynamics of the
scalar fields as a function of time, namely $\phi=\phi(t)$ by establishing the
correspondence between holographic energy density and quintessence, tachyon,
K-essence and dilaton energy density in a flat FRW universe. The reconstructed
potentials are quite reasonable and have scaling solutions. Our study further
supports the viability of the holographic dark energy model with Hubble radius
as IR cutoff.
