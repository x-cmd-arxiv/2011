including shear viscous effects. The primordial spectrum is dominated by the
thermal fluctuations of the radiation bath, sourced by the dissipative term of
the inflaton field. The dissipative coefficient \Upsilon, computed from first
principles in the close-to-equilibrium approximation, depends in general on the
temperature T, and this dependence renders the system of the linear
fluctuations coupled. Whenever the dissipative coefficient is larger than the
Hubble expansion rate H, there is a growing mode in the fluctuations before
horizon crossing. However, dissipation intrinsically means departures from
equilibrium, and therefore the presence of a shear viscous pressure in the
radiation fluid. This in turn acts as an extra friction term for the radiation
fluctuations that tends to damp the growth of the perturbations. Independently
of the T functional dependence of the dissipation and the shear viscosity, we
find that when the shear viscous coefficient \zeta_s is larger than 3 \rho_r/H
at horizon crossing, \rho_r being the radiation energy density, the shear
damping effect wins and there is no growing mode in the spectrum.

novel and robust behaviour, by taking the limit, N goes to infinity, of a
parameter N. But on the other hand, this does not show that that the infinite
limit is ""physically real"", as some authors have alleged. For my second main
claim is that in these same examples, there is a weaker, yet still vivid, novel

And it is this weaker behaviour which is physically real. My examples are: the
method of arbitrary functions (in probability theory); fractals (in geometry);
superselection for infinite systems (in quantum theory); and phase transitions
for infinite systems (in statistical mechanics).

""programming"" global behaviors through local constraints belong to the area of
security. The ""program particles"" that assure that a system of local

protocols. As computation spreads beyond cyberspace, into physical and social

physical sensors and controllers, including the humans, and interlaced with
social networks, the engineering concepts and techniques of computer security
blend with the social processes of security. These new connectors for

actor-networks as a formal model of computation in heterogenous networks of

algorithms used in adaptive filtering, system identification and adaptive
control. Its popularity is mainly due to its fast convergence speed, which is
considered to be optimal in practice. In this paper, RLS methods are used to
solve reinforcement learning problems, where two new reinforcement learning
algorithms using linear value function approximators are proposed and analyzed.
The two algorithms are called RLS-TD(lambda) and Fast-AHC (Fast Adaptive
Heuristic Critic), respectively. RLS-TD(lambda) can be viewed as the extension
of RLS-TD(0) from lambda=0 to general lambda within interval [0,1], so it is a
multi-step temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithm using RLS methods. The
convergence with probability one and the limit of convergence of RLS-TD(lambda)
are proved for ergodic Markov chains. Compared to the existing LS-TD(lambda)
algorithm, RLS-TD(lambda) has advantages in computation and is more suitable
for online learning. The effectiveness of RLS-TD(lambda) is analyzed and
verified by learning prediction experiments of Markov chains with a wide range
of parameter settings. The Fast-AHC algorithm is derived by applying the
proposed RLS-TD(lambda) algorithm in the critic network of the adaptive
heuristic critic method. Unlike conventional AHC algorithm, Fast-AHC makes use
of RLS methods to improve the learning-prediction efficiency in the critic.
Learning control experiments of the cart-pole balancing and the acrobot
swing-up problems are conducted to compare the data efficiency of Fast-AHC with
conventional AHC. From the experimental results, it is shown that the data
efficiency of learning control can also be improved by using RLS methods in the
learning-prediction process of the critic. The performance of Fast-AHC is also
compared with that of the AHC method using LS-TD(lambda). Furthermore, it is
demonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the variance
matrix in RLS-TD(lambda) are required to get better performance not only in
learning prediction but also in learning control. The experimental results are
analyzed based on the existing theoretical work on the transient phase of
forgetting factor RLS methods.

previous generation HI Parkes All-Sky Survey. We confirm previous results that
indicate a substantial discrepancy between the observational distribution and
the theoretical one expected in a cold dark matter (CDM) universe, at low

abundance of galaxies with w = 50 km/s (increasing to a factor of ~100 when
extrapolated to the ALFALFA limit of w = 20 km/s). We furthermore identify
possible solutions, including a keV warm dark matter scenario and the fact that
HI disks in low mass galaxies are usually not extended enough to probe the full
amplitude of the galactic rotation curve. In this latter case, we can
statistically infer the relationship between the measured HI rotational
velocity of a galaxy and the mass of its host CDM halo. Observational
verification of the presented relationship at low velocities would provide an
important test of the validity of the established dark matter model.

resistance, for good contacts, is R_Q/2N, where N is the number of nanotubes
and R_Q=12.9 kOhm [See e.g. M. Ferrier et al., Solid State Commun. 131, 615
(2004)]. We assume this would be 2R_Q/N for a triplet superconductor with all
spins in the same direction and no orbital degeneracy, which may be the case
for nanofilaments in OAPP. Hence one may infer a minimum number of filaments
for a given resistance. In the present model, the E(K) curve for the bosons is
taken to be of a Bogoliubov form, but with a less steep initial linear term in
the dispersion at T_c than occurs at low T. This form is different from the
simple linear plus quadratic dispersion, with a steeper initial slope, used in
my 2005 paper. A combination of theory and experimental data has been used to
find approximate constraints on parameters appearing in the theory.

three of them are detected in the radio above 1 mJy flux density at 1.4 GHz
frequency. Among them, J1429+5447 (z=6.21) is the highest-redshift radio quasar
known at present. These rare, distant, and powerful objects provide important
insight into the activity of the supermassive black holes in the Universe at
early cosmological epochs, and on the physical conditions in their environment.
Aims: We studied the compact radio structure of J1429+5447 on the
milli-arcsecond (mas) angular scale, in order to compare the structural and
spectral properties with those of other two z~6 radio-loud quasars, J0836+0054
(z=5.77) and J1427+3312 (z=6.12). Methods: We performed Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) imaging observations of J1429+5447 with the European VLBI
Network (EVN) at 1.6 GHz on 2010 June 8, and at 5 GHz on 2010 May 27. Results:
Based on its observed radio properties, the compact but somewhat resolved
structure on linear scales of <100 pc, and the steep spectrum, the quasar
J1429+5447 is remarkably similar to J0836+0054 and J1427+3312. To answer the
question whether the compact steep-spectrum radio emission is a ""universal""
feature of the most distant radio quasars, it is essential to study more, yet
to be discovered radio-loud active galactic nuclei at z>6.

that enterprises manage. To integrate these new data sources with enterprise
data, the current state-of-the-art approach is to convert the images to ASCII
text using optical character recognition (OCR) software and then to store the
resulting ASCII text in a relational database. The OCR problem is challenging,
and so the output of OCR often contains errors. In turn, queries on the output
of OCR may fail to retrieve relevant answers. State-of-the-art OCR programs,
e.g., the OCR powering Google Books, use a probabilistic model that captures
many alternatives during the OCR process. Only when the results of OCR are
stored in the database, do these approaches discard the uncertainty. In this
work, we propose to retain the probabilistic models produced by OCR process in
a relational database management system. A key technical challenge is that the
probabilistic data produced by OCR software is very large (a single book blows
up to 2GB from 400kB as ASCII). As a result, a baseline solution that
integrates these models with an RDBMS is over 1000x slower versus standard text
processing for single table select-project queries. However, many applications
may have quality-performance needs that are in between these two extremes of
ASCII and the complete model output by the OCR software. Thus, we propose a
novel approximation scheme called Staccato that allows a user to trade recall
for query performance. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis of our
scheme's properties, and describe how we integrate our scheme with
standard-RDBMS text indexing.

Poincare dodecahedral space. The optimal fit of this model to WMAP data was
recently found using an optimal cross-correlation method, but the systematic
error in the estimate of the matched-circle angular radius \alpha, or
equivalently, the (comoving) size of the Universe 2\rinj (twice the injectivity
radius), might be much higher than the random error. In order to increase the
falsifiability of the model, it would be useful to reduce the uncertainty in
this estimate and to estimate the fraction of the sky where multiply imaged
gravitationally bound objects should potentially be detectable. ""Matched discs""
are defined in order to describe a useful subset of multiply imaged objects.
The cross-correlation method at \ltapprox 1 \hGpc is applied to WMAP 7-year
data in order to improve the estimate of \alpha. The improved matched-circle
radius estimate is \alpha = 23 \pm 1.4 deg, where the uncertainty represents
systematic error dependent on the choices of galactic mask and all-sky map.
This is equivalent to 2\rinj = 18.2\pm 0.5 \hGpc for matter density parameter
Omega_m=0.28\pm 0.02. The lowest redshift of multiply imaged objects is
z=106\pm18. Multiply imaged high overdensity (rare) peaks visible during
200>z>106 should be present in matched discs of radius 14.8\pm2.3 deg. The
accuracy in the matched circle radius estimate is considerably improved by
using the higher resolution signal. The predicted matched discs (over
200>z>106) project to about 20% of the full sky. Since any object located
exactly in the discs would be multiply imaged at equal redshifts, evolutionary
effects would be small for objects that are nearly located in the discs.

when perfect channel information is available at the transmitter (CSIT) are
studied in this report. With CSIT, the transmitter can perform various
techniques such as rate adaption, power allocation, or beamforming. Previously,
the exploration of these fundamental results assumed long-term constraints, for
example, channel codes can have infinite decoding delay, and power or rate is
normalized over infinite channel-uses. With long-term constraints, the
transmitter can operate at the rate lower than the instantaneous mutual
information and error-free transmission can be supported. In this report, we
focus on the performance limits of short-term behavior for STBC systems. We
assume that the system has block power constraint, block rate constraint, and
finite decoding delay. With these constraints, although the transmitter can
perform rate adaption, power control, or beamforming, we show that
decoding-error is unavoidable. In the high SNR regime, the diversity gain is
upperbounded by the product of the number of transmit antennas, receive
antennas, and independent fading block channels that messages spread over. In
other words, fading cannot be completely combatted with short-term constraints.

to transform the utility maximization problem into an equivalent max-min

improve the total utility by simulated annealing. The proposed distributed

convergence due to simulated annealing involved in the global optimization. The

Lagrangian for the latter limit by taking a large worldsheet boost of the BMN
theory. We then calculate one-loop corrections to the correlators of the
various fields using both theories. In all cases the near-flat-space results
agree with a limit of the BMN results, providing evidence for the quantum
consistency of this truncation. The corrections can also be compared to an
expansion of the exact dispersion relation, known from integrability apart from
one interpolating function h(lambda). Here we see agreement with the results of
McLoughlin, Roiban & Tseytlin, and we observe that it does not appear to be
possible to fully implement the cutoff suggested by Gromov & Mikhaylov,
although for some terms we can do so. In both the near-flat-space and BMN
calculations there are some extra terms in the mass shifts which break
supersymmetry. These terms are extremely sensitive to the cutoff used, and can
perhaps be seen as a consequence of using dimensional regularisation.

transformations. The mass m and momentum p of the modeled Dirac particle depend
on {\ell} according to newfound relations m = mo cos (2{\pi}{\ell}/{\lambda})

{\lambda} is the Compton wavelength of the modeled particle. These relations
represent departures from a relativistically invariant mass and the de Broglie

accurate when {\ell} {\ll} {\lambda}. Calculating the vacuum energy in the

a small positive value) for a sufficiently large wave number cutoff. This is a
marked departure from the usual behavior of such a massless field.

excitement within the astroparticle physics community, but the compatibility
between signal claims and null results of different experiments is far from
being a settled issue. In this context, we study here the prospects for
constraining the dark matter parameter space with the next generation of
ton-scale detectors. Using realistic experimental capabilities for a wide range
of targets (including fluorine, sodium, argon, germanium, iodine and xenon),
the role of target complementarity is analysed in detail while including the
impact of astrophysical uncertainties in a self-consistent manner. We show
explicitly that a multi-target signal in future direct detection facilities can
determine the sign of the ratio of scalar couplings $f_n/f_p$, but not its
scale. This implies that the scalar-proton cross-section is left essentially
unconstrained if the assumption $f_p\sim f_n$ is relaxed. Instead, we find that
both the axial-proton cross-section and the ratio of axial couplings $a_n/a_p$
can be measured with fair accuracy if multi-ton instruments using sodium and
iodine will eventually come online. Moreover, it turns out that future direct
detection data can easily discriminate between elastic and inelastic
scatterings. Finally, we argue that, with weak assumptions regarding the WIMP
couplings and the astrophysics, only the dark matter mass and the inelastic
parameter (i.e. mass splitting) may be inferred from the recoil spectra --
specifically, we anticipate an accuracy of tens of GeV (tens of keV) in the
measurement of the dark matter mass (inelastic parameter).

observations in the direction of the center of the galaxy IC 4765-f01-1504 at a
redshift of 0.0353. These two observations were separated by 211 days, with the
0.2-10 keV absorbed flux increasing by a factor of about 9. Their spectra are
best described by a model dominated by a thermal disk or a single-temperature
blackbody component (contributing >80% of the flux) plus a weak power-law
component. The thermal emission has a temperature of a few tens of eV, and the
weak power-law component has a photon index of ~3.5. Similar to the black hole
X-ray binaries in the thermal state, our source exhibits an accretion disk
whose luminosity appears to follow the $L\propto T^4$ relation. This would
indicate that the black hole mass is about 10^5-10^6 M_sun using the
best-fitting inner disk radius. Both XMM-Newton observations show variability
of about 21% on timescales of hours, which can be explained as due to fast
variations in the mass accretion rate. The source was not detected by ROSAT in
an observation in 1992, indicating a variability factor of >64 over longer
timescales. The source was not detected again in X-rays in a Swift observation
in 2011 February, implying a flux decrease by a factor of >12 since the last
XMM-Newton observation. The transient nature, in addition to the extreme
softness of the X-ray spectra and the inactivity of the galaxy implied by the
lack of strong optical emission lines, makes it a candidate tidal disruption
event. If this is the case, the first XMM-Newton observation would have been in
the rising phase, and the second one in the decay phase.

line-of-sight velocity separation of 350 km/s, in its Sloan Digital Sky Survey

that the two AGN emission components have not only a velocity offset, but also
a projected spatial offset of 1.9 kpc/h70 on the sky. Chandra/ACIS observations
of two X-ray sources with the same spatial offset and orientation as the

AGN, although the observations could also be explained by AGN jets. Deeper
X-ray observations that reveal Fe K lines, if present, would distinguish

tested quantitatively in upcoming nuclear and particle physics experiments, but
only to the extent that theoretical computations are robust. Currently there
exist orders-of-magnitude discrepancies between treatments of charge transport
dynamics during EWBG performed by different groups, each relying on different
sets of approximations. In this work, we introduce a consistent power counting
scheme (in ratios of length scales) for treating systematically the dynamics of
EWBG: CP-asymmetric flavor oscillations, collisions, and diffusion. Within the
context of a simplified model of EWBG, we derive the relevant Boltzmann
equations using non-equilibrium field theory, and solve them exactly without
ansatz for the functional form of the density matrices. We demonstrate the
existence of a resonant enhancement in charge production when the flavor
oscillation length is comparable to the wall thickness. We compare our results
with the existing treatment of EWBG by Konstandin, Prokopec, Schmidt, and Seco
(KPSS) who previously identified the importance of flavor oscillations in EWBG.
We conclude: (i) the power counting of KPSS breaks down in the resonant regime,
and (ii) this leads to substantial underestimation of the charge generated in
the unbroken phase, and potentially of the final baryon asymmetry.

Bell's theorem and its supporting experiments. By contrast, we provide a
strictly local, deterministic, and realistic explanation for the correlations
observed in two such supporting experiments, performed independently at Orsay
and Innsbruck. To this end, a pair of local variables is constructed to
simulate detections of photon polarizations at various angles, chosen freely by
Alice and Bob. These generate purely random outcomes, A = +1 or -1 and B = +1
or -1, occurring within a parallelized 3-sphere. These outcomes do not depend
on the contexts of measurements, but are determined entirely by the randomly
chosen initial orientation of the 3-sphere. When they are compared, however,
the correlation between them turn out to be exactly equal to -cos2(alpha -
beta), with the corresponding CHSH inequality violated for the polarization
angles alpha, alpha', beta, and beta' in precisely the manner predicted by
quantum mechanics. The key ingredient in our explanation is the topology of the
3-sphere, which remains closed under multiplication, thus preserving the
locality condition of Bell. It allows us to model the physical space as a
3-sphere, and reveals that the illusion of quantum nonlocality in the present
case stems from a twist in the Hopf fibration of the 3-sphere.

For these objects we find a mean flux density of $56\pm 9$ $\mu$Jy. A similar
stack of radio-quiet white dwarfs yields an upper limit of 43 $\mu$Jy at a
5$\sigma$ significance to the flux in blank regions of the sky. This implies an
average star formation rate of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.3 M$_{\odot}$ year$^{-1}$ for K+A
galaxies. However the majority of the signal comes from $\sim$4% of K+A fields
that have aperture fluxes above the $5\sigma$ noise level of the FIRST survey.
A stack of the remaining galaxies shows little residual flux consistent with an
upper limit on star formation of 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ year$^{-1}$. Even for a subset
of 456 `young' (spectral ages $<$ 250 Myr) K+A galaxies we find that the
stacked 1.4 GHz flux is consistent with no current star formation. Our data
suggest that the original starburst has been terminated in the majority of K+A
galaxies, but that this may represent part of a duty cycle where a fraction of
these galaxies may be active at a given moment with dusty starbursts and AGNs
being present.

interactions, that is globally coupled large families of dynamical systems on
the unit circle with non-trivial stochastic dynamics. Each isolated system is a
diffusion process on a circle, with drift -delta V', where V' is a periodic
function and delta is an intensity parameter. It is well known that the
interacting dynamics is accurately described, in the limit of infinitely many
interacting components, by a Fokker-Planck PDE and the model reduces for
delta=0 to a particular case of the Kuramoto synchronization model, for which
one can show the existence of a stable normally hyperbolic manifold of
stationary solutions for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (we are
interested in the case in which this manifold is non-trivial, that happens when
the interaction is sufficiently strong, that is in the synchronized regime of
the Kuramoto model). We use the robustness of normally hyperbolic structures to
infer qualitative and quantitative results on the |delta|< delta0 cases, with
delta0 a suitable threshold: as a matter of fact, we obtain an accurate
description of the dynamics on the invariant manifold for delta=0 and we link
it explicitly to the potential V . This approach allows to have a complete
description of the phase diagram of the active rotators model, at least for
|delta|< delta0, thus identifying for which values of the parameters (notably,
noise intensity and/or coupling strength) the system exhibits periodic pulse
waves or stabilizes at a quiescent resting state. Moreover, some of our results
are very explicit and this brings a new insight into the combined effect of
active rotator dynamics, noise and interaction. The links with the literature
on specific systems, notably neuronal models, are discussed in detail.

us to determine the entire probability distribution function (PDF). Any generic

cumulant correlators as tools to analyse tSZ catalogs and relate them to
corresponding statistical descriptors of the underlying density distribution.
The statistics of hot spots in frequency-cleaned tSZ maps are also developed in
a self-consistent way to an arbitrary order, to obtain results complementary to
those found using the halo model. We also consider different beam sizes, to
check the extent to which the PDF can be extracted from various observational
configurations. The formalism is presented with two specific models for

familiar ensemble of statistical mechanics. These histories are assigned
extended probabilities, which can sometimes be negative or greater than one. As
we will show, this construction implies that the real history is not completely

sufficiently and appropriately coarse-grained sets of alternative histories
have standard probabilities providing information about the real fine-grained
history that can be compared with observation. We recover the probabilities of
decoherent histories quantum mechanics for sets of histories that are recorded

assuming also that the LSP is the lightest neutralino chi. The part of the
CMSSM parameter space that is compatible with the measured astrophysical
density of cold dark matter is known to include a stau_1 - chi coannihilation
strip, a focus-point strip where chi has an enhanced Higgsino component, and a
funnel at large tanb where the annihilation rate is enhanced by the poles of
nearby heavy MSSM Higgs bosons, A/H. We calculate the total annihilation rates,
the fractions of annihilations into different Standard Model final states and
the resulting fluxes of gamma rays for CMSSM scenarios along these strips. We
observe that typical annihilation rates are much smaller in the coannihilation
strip for tanb = 10 than along the focus-point strip or for tanb = 55, and that
the annihilation branching ratios differ greatly between the different dark
matter strips. Whereas the current Fermi-LAT data are not sensitive to any of
the CMSSM scenarios studied, and the calculated gamma-ray fluxes are probably
unobservably low along the coannihilation strip for tanb = 10, we find that
substantial portions of the focus-point strips and rapid-annihilation funnel
regions could be pressured by several more years of Fermi-LAT data, if
understanding of the astrophysical background and/or systematic uncertainties
can be improved in parallel.

at least two giant planets. We have performed highly detailed dynamical
analysis of the orbits of those planets and show that the proposed system is
highly unstable on timescales of < 5\times 10$^3$ years. For the coplanar
orbits suggested in the discovery letter, we find stable orbital solutions for
the planetary system only if the outer body moves on an orbit that brings it no
closer to the host star than ~ 6 AU. The required periastron distance for the
outer planet lies approximately 5 Hill radii beyond the orbit of the inner
planet, and well beyond the 1-{\sigma} error bars placed on the orbit of the
outer planet in the discovery letter. If the orbits of the proposed planets are
significantly inclined with respect to one another, the median stability
increases slightly, but such systems still become destabilised on
astronomically minute timescales (typically within a few 10$^4$ years). Only in
the highly improbable scenario where the outer planet follows a retrograde but
coplanar orbit (i.e. inclined by 180 degrees to the orbit of the inner planet)
is there any significant region of stability within the original 1-{\sigma}
orbital uncertainties. Our results suggest that, if there is a second (and
potentially, a third planet) in the HU Aquarii system, its orbit is
dramatically different to that suggested in the discovery paper, and that more
observations are critically required in order to constrain the nature of the
suggested orbital bodies.

Excluded volume interactions by the inert particles hinder the diffusive motion
of reactants. When the initial distribution of the inert particles is uniform,
the excluded volume interactions slow the decay of the survival probability of
a geminate pair in contrast to the acceleration of the decay found for the
target problem under the presence of the excluded volume interactions among
reactants. We also obtain the escape probability for a non-uniform initial
distribution of the inert particles and show that reaction yield is increased
when the reaction proceeds in the presence of a positive density gradient of
the inert particles which inhibits the escape of reactants. The effect can be
interpreted as a cage effect.

general framework of Markovian supermarket models, including a system of
differential equations for the fraction measure and a system of nonlinear
equations for the fixed point. To understand this framework heuristically, this
paper gives a detailed analysis for three important supermarket examples: M/G/1
type, GI/M/1 type and multiple choices, explains how to derive the system of
differential equations by means of density-dependent jump Markov processes, and
shows that the fixed point may be simply super-exponential through solving the
system of nonlinear equations. Note that supermarket models are a class of
complicated queueing systems and their analysis can not apply popular queueing
theory, it is necessary in the study of supermarket models to summarize such a
more general framework which enables us to focus on important research issues.
On this line, this paper develops matrix-analytical methods of Markovian
supermarket models. We hope this will be able to open a new avenue in
performance evaluation of supermarket models by means of matrix-analytical
methods.

dividing by the sum of counts in the denominator isotope, the estimated ratio
is less biased: the bias is approximately equal to the ratio divided by the
summed counts of the denominator isotope over the entire measurement. We
propose a third ratio estimator (Beale's estimator) that can be used when the
bias from the summed counts is unacceptably large for the hypothesis being
tested. We derive expressions for the variance of these ratio estimators as
well as the conditions under which they are normally distributed. Finally, we
investigate a SIMS dataset showing the effects of ratio bias, and discuss
proper ratio estimation for SIMS analysis.

populations. This feature requires a two--step process, in which the nuclearly
processed matter from a first generation (FG) of stars gives birth to a second
generation (SG) bearing the fingerprint of a fully CNO-cycled matter. Since the
present population of most globular clusters is made up largely of SG stars, a
substantial fraction of the FG (>~90%) must be lost. Nevertheless, two types of
clusters dominated by a simple stellar population (FG clusters) should exist:
either clusters initially too small to be able to retain a cooling flow and
form a SG (FG-only clusters), or massive clusters that could retain the CNO
processed ejecta and form a SG, but were unable to lose a significant fraction
of their FG (mainly-FG clusters). We attempt a classification of FG clusters,
based on the morphology of their horizontal branches (HBs), as displayed in
photomectric catalogues for 106 clusters. FG candidates are the clusters in
which the HB can be reproduced by the evolution of an almost unique mass. <20%
of clusters with [Fe/H]<-0.8 appear to be FG, but only ~10% probably had a mass
sufficient to form at all an SG. This small percentage confirms on a wider
database that the SG is a dominant constituent of today's clusters, suggesting
that its formation is an ingredient necessary for the survival of globular
clusters during their dynamical evolution in the Galactic tidal field. Pal3
turns out to be a good example of FG-only cluster. HB simulations and space
distribution of its components, indicate that M 53 is a ""mainly-FG"" cluster.
Mainly-FG candidates may be also NGC5634, NGC5694 and NGC6101. In contrast, NGC
2419 contains >30% of SG stars, and its present dynamical status bears less
information on its formation process than the analysis of the chemical
abundances of its stars and of its HB morphology.

equation is estimated. Quantum equations for the evolution of medium
polarization are constructed for the first time. The mathematical method we
developed allows studying the effects of interactions on the evolution of
polarization. The developed method may be applied to various physical systems
in which dynamics is affected by DDI. A problem of elementary excitations in
BEC, either affected or not affected by the uniform external electric field, is
addressed using our method. We show that the evolution of polarization in BEC
leads to the formation of a novel type of elementary excitations. Also, we
consider the process of wave generation in polarized BEC by means of
monoenergetic beam of neutral polarized particles. We compute the possibilities
of the generation of Bogoliubov's modes and polarization modes by the dipole
beam.

smooth surfaces. In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry
corresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The
first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by
illumination (ICPM - illumination characteristic points' method (PM)). The
second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents
from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM - outline tangent PM). These
two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because
positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and
corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is
limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We
also consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic PM)
and CTPM (curve tangent PM), for searching epipolar geometry for images of
smooth bodies based on a set of level curves with constant illumination
intensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on
isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines.
The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve
epipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves
epipolar line. The standard method (SM) based on knowledge of pairs of the
almost exact correspondent points. The methods have been implemented and tested
by SM on pairs of real images. Unfortunately, the last two methods give us only
a finite subset of solutions including ""good"" solution. Exception is ""epipoles
in infinity"". The main reason is inaccuracy of assumption of constant
brightness for smooth bodies. But outline and illumination characteristic
points are not influenced by this inaccuracy. So, the first pair of methods
gives exact results.

The inhomogeneous topology of the a-SiO$_2$ clean surface promotes a total
charge density displacement on the adsorbed graphene sheet, giving rise to
electron-rich as well as hole-rich regions on the graphene. Such anisotropic
distribution of the charge density may contribute to the reduction of the
electronic mobility in G/a-SiO$_2$ systems. Furthermore, the adsorbed graphene
sheet exhibits a net total charge density gain. In this case, the graphene
sheet becomes n-type doped, however, with no formation of chemical bonds at the

sharing between a cooperative relay network (CRN) and a nearby ad-hoc network.
Specifically, we optimize the spectrum access and resource allocation
strategies of the CRN so that the average traffic collision time between the
two networks can be minimized while maintaining a required throughput for the
CRN. The development is first for a frame-level setting, and then is extended
to an ergodic setting. For the latter setting, we propose an appealing optimal
real-time spectrum sharing strategy via Lagrangian dual optimization. The
proposed method only involves a small amount of real-time computation and
negligible control delay, and thus is suitable for practical implementations.

tension. These equations have elegant analytical solutions that replace the
complex integro-differential motion equations by simple differential equations
of pole motion in a complex plane. The main problem with such a solution is the
existence of finite time singularities. To prevent such singularities, nonzero
surface tension is usually used.However, nonzero surface tension does not exist
in filtration combustion, and this destroys the analytical solutions. However,
a more elegant approach exists for solving the problem. First, we can introduce
a small amount of pole noise to the system. Second, for regularisation of the
problem, we throw out all new poles that can produce a finite time singularity.
It can be strictly proved that the asymptotic solution for such a system is a
single finger. Moreover, the qualitative consideration demonstrates that a
finger with 1/2 of the channel width is statistically stable. Therefore, all
properties of such a solution are exactly the same as those of the solution
with nonzero surface tension under numerical noise. The solution of the ST
problem without surface tension is similar to the solution for the equation of
cellular flames in the case of the combustion of gas mixtures.

incoherently pumped by a weak external drive. We solve the master equation of
the system for increasing number of emitters and as a function of the cavity
quality factor, and we identify three main regimes characterized by well
distinguished statistical properties of the emitted radiation. For small cavity
decay rate, the emission events are uncorrelated and the number of photons in
the emitted field becomes larger than one, resembling the build-up of a laser
field inside the cavity. At intermediate decay rates (as compared to the
emitter-cavity coupling) and for few emitters, the statistics of the emitted
radiation is bunched and strikingly dependent on the parity of the number of
emitters. The latter property is related to the cooperativity of the emitters
mediated by their coupling to the cavity mode, and its connection with steady
state subradiance is discussed. Finally, in the bad cavity regime the typical
situation of emission from a collection of individual emitters is recovered. We
also analyze how the cooperative behavior evolves as a function of pure
dephasing, which allows to recover the case of a classical source made of an
ensemble of independent emitters, similar to what is obtained for a very leaky
