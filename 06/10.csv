agree on information that a source node wants to broadcast to them, in the
presence of Byzantine faulty nodes. We consider design of efficient algorithms
for BB in {\em synchronous} point-to-point networks, where the rate of
transmission over each communication link is limited by its ""link capacity"".
The throughput of a particular BB algorithm is defined as the average number of
bits that can be reliably broadcast to all fault-free nodes per unit time using
the algorithm without violating the link capacity constraints. The {\em
capacity} of BB in a given network is then defined as the supremum of all
achievable BB throughputs in the given network, over all possible BB
algorithms.
  We develop NAB -- a Network-Aware Byzantine broadcast algorithm -- for
arbitrary point-to-point networks consisting of $n$ nodes, wherein the number
of faulty nodes is at most $f$, $f<n/3$, and the network connectivity is at
least $2f+1$. We also prove an upper bound on the capacity of Byzantine
broadcast, and conclude that NAB can achieve throughput at least 1/3 of the
capacity. When the network satisfies an additional condition, NAB can achieve
throughput at least 1/2 of the capacity.
  To the best of our knowledge, NAB is the first algorithm that can achieve a
constant fraction of capacity of Byzantine Broadcast (BB) in arbitrary
point-to-point networks.

than required by the laws of quantum mechanics. In particular, free-space
optical detection methods for single atoms and ions such as the shelving
technique, though being among the most sensitive detection methods in quantum
physics, inevitably require spontaneous scattering, even in the dispersive
regime. This causes heating, a limitation for atom-based quantum information
processing where it obviates straightforward reuse of the qubit. No such energy
exchange is required by quantum mechanics. Here we experimentally demonstrate
optical detection of an atomic qubit with significantly less than one
spontaneous scattering event. We measure transmission and reflection of an
optical cavity containing the atom. In addition to the qubit detection itself,
we quantitatively measure how much spontaneous scattering has occurred. This
allows us to relate the information gained to the amount of spontaneous
emission, and we obtain a detection error below 10% while scattering less than
0.2 photons on average. Furthermore, we perform a quantum Zeno type experiment
to quantify the measurement back action and find that every incident photon
leads to an almost complete state collapse. Together, these results constitute
a full experimental characterization of a quantum measurement in the ""energy
exchange-free"" regime below a single spontaneous emission event. Besides its
fundamental interest, this means significant simplification for proposed
neutral-atom quantum computation schemes and may enable sensitive detection of
molecules and atoms lacking closed transitions.

giving instead a constant maximum amplitude. We revisit this problem by
developing the perturbation theory further. We verify that the results found by

new YSO candidates. Our observations increased the number of previously

constructed the V-I/V diagram for 51 optically identified IRAC YSOs in an area
of ~ 13' x 13' centered on S255-IR. We suggest that these YSOs have an
approximate age between 0.1 - 4 Myr, indicating a non-coeval star formation.
Using spectral energy distribution models, we constrained physical properties

ridge, respectively. The models suggest that the sources associated within the

black hole. The isolated and dynamical horizon framework provides such
quasi-local characterization of black hole mass and angular momentum. With this
framework, it is possible in axisymmetry to reformulate the extremality limit
as $|J| \le 2\,M_H^2$, with $M_H$ the irreducible mass of the black hole
computed from its apparent horizon area and $J$ obtained using approximate
rotational Killing vectors on the apparent horizon. The $|J| \le 2\,M_H^2$
condition is also equivalent to requiring a non-negative black hole surface
gravity. We present numerical experiments of an accreting black hole that
temporarily violates this extremality inequality. The initial configuration
consists of a single, rotating black hole surrounded by a thick, shell cloud of
negative energy density. For these numerical experiments, we introduce a new
matter-without-matter evolution method.

and its application to study the SSC emission of Mrk 421. The code couples
Fokker-Planck and Monte Carlo methods, in a 2D geometry. For the first time all
the light travel time effects (LCTE) are fully considered, along with a proper
treatment of Compton cooling, which depends on them. We study a set of simple
scenarios where the variability is produced by injection of relativistic
electrons as a `shock front' crosses the emission region. We consider emission
from two components, with the second one either being pre-existing and
co-spatial and participating in the evolution of the active region, or
spatially separated and independent, only diluting the observed variability.
Temporal and spectral results of the simulation are compared to the
multiwavelength observations of Mrk 421 in March 2001. We find parameters that
can adequately fit the observed SEDs and multiwavelength light curves and
correlations. There remain however a few open issues, most notably: i)
systematic soft intra-band X-ray lags. ii) The quadratic correlation between
the TeV and X-ray flux during the flare decay has not been reproduced. These
features are among those affected by the spatial extent and geometry of the
source. The difficulty of producing hard X-ray lags is exacerbated by a bias
towards soft lags caused by the combination of energy dependent radiative
cooling time-scales and LCTE. About the second emission component, our results
strongly favor the scenario where it is co-spatial and it participates in the
flare evolution, suggesting that different phases of activity may occur in the
same region. The cases presented in this paper represent only an initial study,
and despite their limited scope they make a strong case for the need of true
time-dependent and multi-zone modeling.

In many cases the family of quasimodular forms naturally arises as the

examples of such expansions that arise in the study of partition statistics.
  The crank partition statistic has gathered much interest recently. For
instance, Atkin and Garvan showed that the generating functions for the moments
of the crank statistic are quasimodular forms. The two variable generating
function for the crank partition statistic is a Jacobi form. Exploiting the
structure inherent in the Jacobi theta function we construct explicit
expressions for the functions of Atkin and Garvan. Furthermore, this
perspective opens the door for further investigation including a study of the
moments in arithmetic progressions. We conduct a thorough study of the crank

by dynamical friction for planet masses above several Earth-masses. Smaller

  The time-scales associated with migration and inclination damping are
calculated. For certain values of the inclination, the inclination damping
time-scale is longer than the migration time-scale and the disk lifetime. This

  A large fraction of Hot Jupiters is on highly inclined orbits with respect to
the rotation axis of the star. On the other hand small-mass planetary systems
discovered by the Kepler mission have low mutual inclinations. This shows that
there are two distinct formation mechanisms at work. The process that creates

(non-uniform) self-avoiding walks crossing a square of side k. From this
sample, he constructed an estimator for the number of such walks. The quality
of this estimator is directly related to the (relative) variance of a certain
random variable X_k. From his experiments, Knuth suspected that this variance
was extremely large (so that the estimator would not be very efficient). But
how large? For the analogous Rosenbluth algorithm, which samples unconfined
self-avoiding walks of length n, the variance of the corresponding estimator is
believed to be exponential in n. A few years ago, Bassetti and Diaconis showed
that, for a sampler \`a la Knuth, that generates walks crossing a k\times k
square and consisting of North and East steps, the relative variance is only
O(\sqrt k). In this note we take one step further and show that, for walks
consisting of North, South and East steps, the relative variance jumps to
2^{k(k+1)}/(k+1)^{2k}. This is quasi-exponential in the average length of the
walks, which is of order k^2. We also obtain partial results for general
self-avoiding walks crossing a square, suggesting that the relative variance
could be exponential in k^2 (which is again the average length of these walks).
Knuth's algorithm is a basic example of a widely used technique called
sequential importance sampling. The present paper, following Bassetti and
Diaconis' paper, is one of very few examples where the variance of the
estimator can be found.

Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. Using James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)
observations of L1688 in the Ophiuchus star-forming complex, we analyse the
HCO+ (J=4\rightarrow3) spectral line profiles of prestellar cores. We find that
of the 58 cores observed, 14 show signs of infall in the form of a
blue-asymmetric double-peaked line profile. These 14 cores all lie beyond the
Jeans mass line for the region on a radius-mass plot. Furthermore another 10
cores showing tentative signs of infall, in their spectral line profile shapes,
appear on or just over the Jeans mass line. We therefore propose the manner in
which a prestellar core evolves across this diagram. We hypothesise that a core
is formed in the low-mass, low-radius region of the plot. It then accretes
quasistatically, increasing in both mass and radius. When it crosses the limit
of gravitational instability it begins to collapse, decreasing in radius,
towards the region of the diagram where protostellar cores are seen.

are captured by the dynamics, which includes electrostatic interactions
(Coulomb), magnetostatic backreaction (Biot-Savart), dissipative backreaction
(Abraham-Lorentz) and quantum field fluctuations at zero and finite

show that this approach yields causal and runaway-free equations of motion,
provides new insights into charged particle backreaction, and naturally leads
to equations consistent with the (classical) Darwin Hamiltonian and has quantum
operator ordering consistent with the Breit Hamiltonian. To order 1/c^3 the
approach leads to a nonstandard mass renormalization which is associated with
magnetostatic self-interactions, and no cutoff is required to prevent runaways.
Our new results also show that the pathologies of the standard Abraham-Lorentz
equations can be seen as a consequence of applying an inconsistent (i.e.
incomplete, mixed-order) expansion in 1/c, if, from the start, the analysis is
viewed as generating a low-energy effective theory rather than an exact

multiple-particle interactions.

a modulaton field, a mixed scenario whereby the modulaton is identified with a

one tenth that on its trailing side. The origin of this enigmatic dichotomy has
been debated for over forty years, but with new data, a clearer picture is
emerging. Motivated by Cassini radar and imaging observations, we investigate
Soter's model of dark exogenous dust striking an originally brighter Iapetus by
modeling the dynamics of the dark dust from the ring of the exterior retrograde
satellite Phoebe under the relevant perturbations. In particular, we study the
particles' probabilities of striking Iapetus, as well as their expected spatial
distribution on the Iapetian surface. We find that, of the long-lived particles
(greater than about 5 microns), most particle sizes (greater than about 10
microns) are virtually certain to strike Iapetus, and their calculated
distribution on the surface matches up well with Cassini Regio's extent in its
longitudinal span. The satellite's polar regions are observed to be bright,
presumably because ice is deposited there. Thus, in the latitudinal direction
we estimate polar dust deposition rates to help constrain models of thermal
migration invoked to explain the bright poles (Spencer & Denk 2010). We also
analyze dust originating from other irregular outer moons, determining that a
significant fraction of that material will eventually coat Iapetus--perhaps
explaining why the spectrum of Iapetus' dark material differs somewhat from
that of Phoebe. Finally we track the dust particles that do not strike Iapetus,
and find that most land on Titan, with a smaller fraction hitting Hyperion. As
has been previously conjectured, such exogenous dust, coupled with Hyperion's
chaotic rotation, could produce Hyperion's roughly isotropic, moderate-albedo
surface.

to the stellar continuum uses both standard stellar population models and
empirical templates obtained by combining a large number of stellar spectra in
order to fit a subsample of high-quality SDSS spectra for quiescent galaxies.
Furthermore, our fit to the nebular spectrum includes an exhaustive list of
both recombination and forbidden lines. Foreground Galactic extinction is
implicitly treated in our models, whereas reddening in the SDSS galaxies is
included in the form of a simple dust screen component affecting the entire
spectrum that is accompanied by a second reddening component affecting only the
ionised gas emission. In order to check for systematic departures, we provide a
quality assessment for our fit to the SDSS spectra in our sample. This quality
assessment also allows the identification of objects with either problematic
data or peculiar features. For example, based on the quality assessment,
approximately 1% of the SDSS spectra classified as ""galaxies"" by the SDSS
pipeline do in fact require additional broad lines to be matched, even though
they do not show a strong continuum from an active nucleus, as do the SDSS
objects classified as ""quasars"". Finally, we provide new spectral templates for

to simple density profiles for the external medium (mostly constant density and
power-law R^{-k} ones). We argue that a large fraction of long-duration GRBs
should take place in massive stellar clusters where the circumburst medium is
much more complicated. As a case study, we simulate the propagation of a GRB
blast wave in a medium shaped by the collision of the winds of O and Wolf-Rayet
stars, the typical distance of which is d /sim 0.1 - 1 pc. Assuming a spherical
blast wave, the afterglow light curve shows a flattening followed by a shallow
break on a timescale from hours up to a week after the burst, which is a result
of the propagation of the blast wave through the shocked wind region. If the
blast wave is collimated, the jet break may, in some cases, become very
pronounced with the post break decline of the light curve as steep as t-5.
Inverse Compton scattering of ultra-violet photons from the nearby star off
energetic electrons in the blast wave leads to a bright \simGeV afterglow flare

field. We point out that the Hamiltonian for a real Klein-Gordon scalar field
must be consistent with the energy density obtained from the Schrodinger
equation in the non-relativistic regime. To achieve this we had to add some
surface terms (total divergencies) to the standard Hamiltonian, which in
general will not change the equations of motion, but will redefine energy. As
an additional requirement, a Hamiltonian must be able to reproduce the
equations of motion directly from Hamilton's equations defined by the principle
of the least action. We find that the standard Hamiltonian does not always do
so and that the proposed Hamiltonian provides a good non-relativistic limit.
This is a hint that something as simple as the Hamiltonian of the real
Klein-Gordon scalar field has to be treated carefully. We had illustrated our
discussion with an explicit example of the kink solution.

reorientation from in-plane to perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The model is
based on the minimum of the magnetic anisotropy energy with respect to the
orientation of the magnetic moment of the film. Magnetic anisotropy energies
are taken as the sum of shape anisotropy, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and
magnetoelastic anisotropy, the two latter ones being present as constant
surface and variable volume contributions. Other than anisotropy materials
constants, readily available from literature, only information about the strain

thickness in terms of lattice mismatch. The model can predict the critical spin
reorientation transition thickness with surprising accuracy.

queueing models with repeated inhomogeneous vacations. The server goes on for a

Once the system enters in vacation mode, it may continue for several
consecutive vacations. At the end of a vacation, the server goes on another
vacation, possibly with a different probability distribution; if during the
previous vacation there have been no arrivals. However the system enters in
vacation mode only if the inactivity is persisted beyond defined trigger
duration. In order to get an insight on the influence of parameters on the
performance, we choose to study a simple M/G/1 queue (Poisson arrivals and
general independent service times) which has the advantage of being tractable
analytically. The theoretical model is applied to the problem of power saving
for mobile devices in which the sleep durations of a device correspond to the
vacations of the server. Various system performance metrics such as the frame
response time and the economy of energy are derived. A constrained optimization
problem is formulated to maximize the economy of energy achieved in power save
mode, with constraints as QoS conditions to be met. An illustration of the
proposed methods is shown with a WiMAX system scenario to obtain design
parameters for better performance. Our analysis allows us not only to optimize
the system parameters for a given traffic intensity but also to propose
parameters that provide the best performance under worst case conditions.

the optical emission is dominated by contributions from the secondary and

dominates the optical emission. There are two possible transitional objects
that lie between these groups. The faintest CVs likely lie near the minimum of
the CV period distribution, where an accumulation is expected. The spatial
distribution of the brighter CVs is much more centrally concentrated than those
of the fainter CVs and the active binaries. This may represent the result of an
evolutionary process in which CVs are produced by dynamical interactions, such
as exchange reactions, near the cluster center and are scattered to larger

find one system where the extracted radial velocities of two identified

one is caused by irradiation from the hot white dwarf primary and the other by
stellar activity. Another object presents two components that are located on
opposite sides of the centre-of-mass, suggesting a case similar to LTT 560,
i.e. that accretion of stellar wind from the secondary star produces Halpha
emission on, or close to, the white dwarf.

the characteristic function is a continuous-time bounded mean ergodic process.
A central planner interacts continuously over time with the players by choosing
the instantaneous allocations subject to budget constraints. Before the game
starts, the central planner knows the nature of the process (bounded mean
ergodic), the bounded set from which the coalitions' values are sampled, and
the long run average coalitions' values. On the other hand, he has no knowledge
of the underlying probability function generating the coalitions' values. Our
goal is to find allocation rules that use a measure of the extra reward that a
coalition has received up to the current time by re-distributing the budget
among the players. The objective is two-fold: i) guaranteeing convergence of
the average allocations to the core (or a specific point in the core) of the
average game, ii) driving the coalitions' excesses to an a priori given cone.
The resulting allocation rules are robust as they guarantee the aforementioned
convergence properties despite the uncertain and time-varying nature of the
coaltions' values. We highlight three main contributions. First, we design an
allocation rule based on full observation of the extra reward so that the
average allocation approaches a specific point in the core of the average game,
while the coalitions' excesses converge to an a priori given direction. Second,
we design a new allocation rule based on partial observation on the extra
reward so that the average allocation converges to the core of the average
game, while the coalitions' excesses converge to an a priori given cone. And
third, we establish connections to approachability theory and attainability
theory.

sudden deviation of the summed photomultiplier noise rate from its nominal
value during the neutrino burst, making IceCube a $\approx 3$ Megaton effective
detection volume - class supernova detector. While galactic supernovae can be
resolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains
unconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to
supernova core collapse models.
  The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect
supernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and
time. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented
detector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume
for such coincidental hits is much smaller ($\gtrsim 35\,$kton, about the scale
of SuperK), a wealth of information is obtained due to the comparatively low
coincidental noise rate. We demonstrate that a neutrino flux from a core
collapse supernova will produce a signature enabling the resolution of rough
spectral features and, in the case of a strong signal, providing indication on
its location.
  We further discuss the enhanced potential of a rather modest detector
extension, a denser array in the center of IceCube, within our one dimensional
analytic calculation framework. Such an extension would enable the exploration
of the neutrino sky above a few GeV and the detection of supernovae up to a few
100's of kilo parsec. However, a $3-4\,$Mpc detection distance, necessary for
routine supernova detection, demands a significant increase of the effective
detection volume and can be obtained only with a more ambitious instrument,
particularly the boosting of sensor parameters such as the quantum efficiency
and light collection area.

singularity and evolved through four different regimes: inflation, radiation,
dark matter and dark energy dominated eras. In the radiation and dark matter
dominated stages, the expansion of the Universe decelerates while the inflation
and dark energy eras are accelerating regimes. So far there is no clear cut
connection between these accelerating periods. More intriguing, the substance
driving the present accelerating stage remains a mystery, and the best
available candidate (vacuum energy density) is plagued with the coincidence and
cosmological constant problems. In this paper we overcome such problems through
an alternative cosmic scenario based on gravitationally-induced particle
production. The model proposed here is non-singular with the space-time
emerging from a pure initial de Sitter stage thereby providing a natural
solution to the horizon problem. Subsequently, due to an instability provoked
by the production of massless particles, the Universe evolves smoothly to the
standard radiation dominated era thereby ending the production of radiation as
required by the conformal invariance (Parker's theorem). Next, the radiation
becomes subdominant with the Universe entering in the cold dark matter
dominated era. Finally, the negative pressure associated with the creation of
cold dark matter particles accelerates the expansion and drives the Universe to
a final de Sitter stage. The late time cosmic expansion history is exactly like
in the standard LCDM model, however, there is no dark energy. The model evolves
between two limiting (early and late time) de Sitter regimes. Our scenario is
fully determined by two extreme energy densities, or equivalently, the
associated de Sitter Hubble scales connected by 122 orders of magnitude.

the host galaxy has properties similar to those of an ultraluminous infrared
galaxy (ULIRG). The star-formation rate (SFR) of the host galaxy as derived
from submillimeter and radio continuum emission is a few 100 M_sun/yr, which is
an order of magnitude greater than the SFR derived from optical line emission.
The large discrepancy between the SFRs derived from different observing
wavelengths indicates the presence of a bulk of dust-obscured star formation
and molecular gas that is enough to sustain the intense star formation. We
failed to detect CO emission and derived 2sigma upper limits on the velocity
integrated CO(2-1) luminosity of L'CO < 6.9 x 10^9 K km/s/pc^2 and the
molecular gas mass of M(H2) < 5.5 x 10^9 M_sun by adopting a velocity width of
300 km/s and a CO-to-H2 conversion factor of alpha_CO = 0.8 M_sun/(K
km/s/pc^2), which are standard values for ULIRGs. The lower limit on the ratio
of far-infrared luminosity to CO luminosity, a measure of the star-formation
efficiency, is higher compared to that of other gamma-ray burst hosts and other
galaxy populations, which is consistent with active star formation taking place
in this galaxy.

experimental realization of large-scale quantum processing devices. Recently a
series of measurements of the heating rates in surface-electrode ion traps
characterized their frequency, distance, and temperature dependencies, but our
understanding of the microscopic origin of this noise is still vague. In this
work we develop a theoretical model for the electric field noise which is
associated with a random distribution of adsorbed atoms on the trap electrode
surface. By using first principle calculations of the fluctuating dipole
moments of the adsorbed atoms we evaluate the distance, frequency and
temperature dependence of the resulting electric field fluctuation spectrum.Our
theory calculates the noise spectrum beyond the standard scenario of two-level
fluctuators, by incorporating all the relevant vibrational states. The $1/f$
noise is shown to commence at roughly the frequency of the fundamental phonon
transition rate and the $d^{-4}$ dependence with distance of the ion from the
electrode surface is established.

Between two main polarities of the large emerging flux regions with more than
around 2 \times 10^19 Mx, there were the converging flows of anti-polarity
magnetic patches. On the other hand, small ephemeral regions showed no
converging flow but simple diverging pattern. When we looked into the detailed
features in the emerging sites, irrespective of the total flux and the spatial
size, all the emergence events were observed to consist of single or multiple
elementary emergence unit(s). The typical size of unitary emergence is 4 Mm and
consistent with the simulation results. From the statistical study of the flux
emergence events, the maximum spatial distance between two main polarities, the
magnetic flux growth rate and the mean separation speed were found to follow
the power-law functions of the total magnetic flux with the indices of 0.27,

programs into defeasible theories, the semantics for the ambiguity blocking

factor $\alpha=h/h_{LLD}$, where hLLD is obtained for a pure liquid, in a wide
range of capillary ($Ca=\eta V/\gamma$), two regimes of constant thickening can
be identified: at small capillary number, $\alpha$ is large due to a
confinement and surface elasticity (or Marangoni) effects and at large Ca,
$\alpha$ is slightly higher than unity, due to surface viscous effects. At
intermediate Ca, $\alpha$ decreases as Ca increases along a ""dynamic
transition"". In the case of non-ionic surfactants, the dynamic transition
occurs at a fixed Ca, independently of the surfactant concentration, while for
ionic surfactants, the dynamic transition depends on the concentration due to
the existence of an electrostatic barrier. The control of physico-chemical
parameters allowed us to elucidate the nature of the dynamic transition and to
relate it to surface rheology.

decoding procedure for it. Rank order coding was proposed by Simon Thorpe et
al. who stated that the retina represents the visual stimulus by the order in
which its cells are activated. A classical rank order coder/decoder was then
designed on this basis [1]. Though, it appeared that the decoding procedure
employed yields reconstruction errors that limit the model Rate/Quality
performances when used as an image codec. The attempts made in the literature
to overcome this issue are time consuming and alter the coding procedure, or
are lacking mathematical support and feasibility for standard size images. Here
we solve this problem in an original fashion by using the frames theory, where
a frame of a vector space designates an extension for the notion of basis.
First, we prove that the analyzing filter bank considered is a frame, and then
we define the corresponding dual frame that is necessary for the exact image
reconstruction. Second, to deal with the problem of memory overhead, we design
a recursive out-of-core blockwise algorithm for the computation of this dual
frame. Our work provides a mathematical formalism for the retinal model under
study and defines a simple and exact reverse transform for it with up to 270 dB
of PSNR gain compared to [1]. Furthermore, the framework presented here can be
extended to several models of the visual cortical areas using redundant
representations.

standard drift ordering can no longer be assumed and a full orbit approach is
required. The effect of radial electric field shear on neoclassical particle
transport is quantified for a range of test particle mass and charge numbers
and electric field parameters. It is shown that the effect of a sheared
electric field is to enhance the confinement of impurity species above the
level observed in the absence of such a field. The effect may be explained in
terms of a collisional drag force drift, which is proportional to particle
charge number but independent of particle mass. This drift acts inwards for
negative radial electric fields and outwards for positive fields, implying
strongly enhanced confinement of highly ionized impurity ions in the presence
of a negative radial electric field.

The dynamics exhibits a strong interplay between coherent processes mediated by
the excitonic Hamiltonian, and incoherent processes due to interactions with
the environment. The spreading of the exciton over a single monomer is well
described by a proper measure of delocalization that allows one to identify two
relevant time scales. An exciton initially localized in one chromophore first
spreads coherently to neighboring chromophores. During this initial coherent
spreading, quantum effects such as entanglement play a role. As the effects of
a decohering environment come into play, coherence and decoherence interact to
give rise to efficient and robust excitonic transport, reaching a maximum
efficiency at the levels of decoherence found in physiological conditions. We
analyze the efficiency for different possible topologies (monomer, dimer,
trimer, tetramer) and show how the trimer has a particular role both in the

an intricate understanding of one's data and the analysis techniques used.
Correcting the raw data at the 10^-4 level of accuracy in flux is one of the
central challenges. This can be difficult for instruments that do not feature a
calibration plan for such high precision measurements. Here, it is not always
obvious how to de-correlate the data using auxiliary information of the
instrument and it becomes paramount to know how well one can disentangle
instrument systematics from one's data, given nothing but the data itself. We
propose a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, based on the concept of
independent component analysis, to de-convolve the systematic noise and all
non-Gaussian signals from the desired astrophysical signal. Such a `blind'
signal de-mixing is commonly known as the `Cocktail Party problem' in
signal-processing. Given multiple simultaneous observations of the same
exoplanetary eclipse, as in the case of spectrophotometry, we show that we can
often disentangle systematic noise from the original light curve signal without
the use of any complementary information of the instrument. In this paper, we
explore these signal extraction techniques using simulated data and two data
sets observed with the Hubble-NICMOS instrument. Another important application
is the de-correlation of the exoplanetary signal from time-correlated stellar
variability. Using data obtained by the Kepler mission we show that the desired
signal can be de-convolved from the stellar noise using a single time series
spanning several eclipse events. Such non-parametric techniques can provide
important confirmations of the existent parametric corrections reported in the
literature, and their associated results. Additionally they can substantially
improve the precision exoplanetary light curve analysis in the future.

schemes for preparing, processing and measuring them are inefficient. For
example, down-conversion provides heralded, but randomly timed single photons,
while linear-optics gates are inherently probabilistic. Here, we introduce a
deterministic scheme for photonic quantum information. Our single, versatile
process---coherent photon conversion---provides a full suite of photonic
quantum processing tools, from creating high-quality heralded single- and
multiphoton states free of higher-order imperfections to implementing
deterministic multiqubit entanglement gates and high-efficiency detection. It
fulfils all requirements for a scalable photonic quantum computing
architecture. Using photonic crystal fibres, we experimentally demonstrate a
four-colour nonlinear process usable for coherent photon conversion and show
that current technology provides a feasible path towards deterministic
operation. Our scheme, based on interacting bosonic fields, is not restricted
to optical systems, but could also be implemented in optomechanical,
electromechanical and superconducting systems which exhibit extremely strong
intrinsic nonlinearities.

led to different speculations such as dynamical ejection of the B-stars from
the central cluster or triggered star formation in a cloud that was swept up in
the collision zone between the two expanding HII regions. The presence or
absence of low-mass stars associated with these B-stars can discriminate
between the possible scenarios. We performed a deep Chandra X-ray observation
of the S254-S258 region in order to efficiently discriminate young stars from
the numerous older field stars in the area. We detected 364 X-ray point
sources, providing a complete sample of all young stars in the observed region
down to ~0.5 Msun. A clustering analysis identifies three significant clusters,
containing 64 X-ray sources in total. After accounting for X-ray background
contaminants, this implies that about 250 X-ray sources constitute a widely
scattered population of young stars. This number agrees well with the
expectation for the low-mass population associated to the B-stars in S255 and
S257 as predicted by an IMF extrapolation. These results are consistent with
the scenario that these two B-stars represent an earlier stellar population and
that their expanding HII regions have swept up the central cloud and trigger
star formation therein.

ultraviolet (UV) through infrared (IR) spectrum. Dust attenuates the radiation
from stars, and re-radiates the energy through equilibrium and non-equilibrium
emission. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), graphite, and silicates
contribute to different features in the spectral energy distribution; however,
they are all highly opaque in the same spectral region - the UV. Compared to
old stellar populations, young populations release a higher fraction of their
total luminosity in the UV, making them a good source of the energetic UV
photons that can power dust emission. However, given their relative abundance,
the question of whether young or old stellar populations provide most of these
photons that power the infrared emission is an interesting question. Using
three samples of galaxies observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope and our
dusty radiative transfer model, we find that young stellar populations (on the
order of 100 million years old) dominate the dust heating in star forming
galaxies, and old stellar populations (13 billion years old) generally
contribute less than 20% of the far-IR luminosity.

application to \textit{WMAP} polarization data is presented, showing its good
performance particularly in very polluted regions of the sky. The applied
wavelet has the advantages of requiring little computational time in its
calculations, being adapted to the \textit{HEALPix} pixelization scheme, and
offering the possibility of multi-resolution analysis. The decomposition is
implemented as part of a fully internal template fitting method, minimizing the
variance of the resulting map at each scale. Using a $\chi^2$ characterization
of the noise, we find that the residuals of the cleaned maps are compatible
with those expected from the instrumental noise. The maps are also comparable
to those obtained from the \textit{WMAP} team, but in our case we do not make
use of external data sets. In addition, at low resolution, our cleaned maps
present a lower level of noise. The E-mode power spectrum $C_{\ell}^{EE}$ is
computed at high and low resolution; and a cross power spectrum $C_{\ell}^{TE}$
is also calculated from the foreground reduced maps of temperature given by
\textit{WMAP} and our cleaned maps of polarization at high resolution. These
spectra are consistent with the power spectra supplied by the \textit{WMAP}

the standard $\Lambda CDM$ model. The B-mode power spectrum $C_{\ell}^{BB}$ is

corresponding phase space form. The dynamical variables of such a system
satisfy the point particle mass shell constraint, the Hamilton and the momentum
constraints of the canonical gravity. In the quantized theory, those
constraints become operators that annihilate a state. A state can be
represented by a wave functional $\Psi$ that simultaneously satisfies the
Klein-Gordon and the Wheeler-DeWitt-Schr\""odinger equation. The latter

term, namely the derivative of $\Psi$ with respect to time, that occurs because
of the presence of the point particle. The particle's time coordinate, $X^0$,
serves the role of time. Next, we generalize the system to $p$-branes, and find
out that for a quantized spacetime filling brane there occurs an effective
cosmological constant, proportional to the expectation value of the brane's
momentum, a degree of freedom that has two discrete values only, a positive and
a negative one. This mechanism could be an explanation for the small
cosmological constant that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe.

about 0.38 s in the last 24 years due to the mass transfer from less massive

forces are available, the translationally invariant shell model picture can be
optimized by an adjustment to the exact wave function and its validity or

which is a columnar measure of aerosol distribution, is determined using
continuous wavelet transform over 35 locations in India. Continuous wavelet
transform is used in the study because it is better suited to extract the
periodic and local modulations present at various frequency ranges, as these
features are invisible in conventional methods such as Fourier Transform.
Monthly mean aerosol optical depths (AODs) from MODerate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite from January 2001 to
December 2012 are used. Annual and quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO) in AOD are
evident in addition to the weak semi-annual and quasi-triennial. The
semi-annual and annual oscillations are consistent with the seasonal and yearly
cycle of variations in AODs. The 40-month periodicity indicates the presence of
long term correlations in AOD. The observed periodicities in MODIS Terra AODs
are also evident in the ground-based AOD measurements made over Kanpur in the
Indo-Gangetic Plain. The phase of the periodicity in AOD is stable in the
mid-frequency range, while local disturbances in the high-frequency range and
long term changes in the atmospheric composition give rise to unstable phases
in low-frequency range. That modulations in AOD over one location/region can
influence the other is revealed by the presence of phase relation among
different locations.

is a critical factor particularly for low-power wireless technologies. A
censored truncated sequential spectrum sensing technique is considered as an
energy-saving approach. To design the underlying sensing parameters, the
maximum energy consumption per sensor is minimized subject to a lower bounded
global probability of detection and an upper bounded false alarm rate. This way
both the interference to the primary user due to miss detection and the network
throughput as a result of a low false alarm rate is controlled. We compare the
performance of the proposed scheme with a fixed sample size censoring scheme
under different scenarios. It is shown that as the sensing cost of the

isotropic, nematic, smectic A, smectic C, and columnar phases. The positionally
ordered phases are investigated only for the case of parallel alignment. It is
found that the central spherical unit destabilizes the nematic with respect to
the isotropic phase, while increasing the length of the cylinder has the
opposite effect. Also, the central hard sphere has a strong destabilizing
effect on the smectic A phase, due the inefficient packing of the molecules
into layers. For large hard sphere units the smectic A phase is completely
replaced by a smectic C structure. The columnar phase is first stabilized with
increasing diameter of the central unit, but for very large hard sphere units
it becomes less stable again. The density functional results are in good
agreement with the simulations.

quantum field theories under the assumption that these theories have to be
described by lagrangians which are renormalizable by weighted power counting.
Our investigation starts from the observation that at high energies
Lorentz-violation and the usual supersymmetry algebra are algebraically
compatible. Demanding linearity of the supercharges we see that the requirement
of renormalizability drastically restricts the set of possible
Lorentz-violating supersymmetric theories. In particular, in the case of
supersymmetric gauge theories the weighted power counting has to coincide with
the usual one and the only Lorentz-violating operators are introduced by some
weighted constant c that explicitly appears in the supersymmetry algebra. This
parameter does not renormalize and has to be very close to the speed of light
at low energies in order to satisfy the strict experimental bounds on Lorentz
violation. The only possible models with non trivial Lorentz-violating
operators involve neutral chiral superfields and do not have a gauge invariant
extension. We conclude that, under the assumption that high-energy physics can
be described by a renormalizable Lorentz-violating extensions of the Standard
Model, the Lorentz fine tuning problem does not seem solvable by the
requirement of supersymmetry.

randomly in time (dynamic disorder). The probability distributions of position
of the QW walker in both instances differ significantly: dynamic disorder leads
to a Gaussian-like distribution, while for static disorder we find two distinct

approach proposed in 1928 by Einstein. It is based on the vierbein field taken
as the ""square root"" of the metric tensor field. Einstein's vierbein theory is
a gauge field theory for gravity; the vierbein field playing the role of a
gauge field but not exactly like the vector potential field does in Yang-Mills
theory--the correction to the derivative (the covariant derivative) is not
proportional to the vierbein field as it would be if gravity were strictly a
Yang-Mills theory. Einstein discovered the spin connection in terms of the
vierbein fields to take the place of the conventional affine connection. To
date, one of the most important applications of the vierbein representation is
for the derivation of the correction to a 4-spinor quantum field transported in
curved space, yielding the correct form of the covariant derivative. Thus, the
vierbein field theory is the most natural way to represent a relativistic
quantum field theory in curved space. Using the vierbein field theory,
presented is a derivation of the the Einstein equation and then the Dirac
equation in curved space. Einstein's original 1928 manuscripts translated into

statistical nature of the evolution and large-scale structure of galaxies by
studying their luminosity distribution as a function of redshift - known as the
galaxy luminosity function (LF). Accurately constructing the LF remains a
popular and yet tricky pursuit in modern observational cosmology where the
presence of observational selection effects due to e.g. detection thresholds in
apparent magnitude, colour, surface brightness or some combination thereof can
render any given galaxy survey incomplete and thus introduce bias into the LF.
  Over the last seventy years there have been numerous sophisticated
statistical approaches devised to tackle these issues; all have advantages --
but not one is perfect. This review takes a broad historical look at the key
statistical tools that have been developed over this period, discussing their
relative merits and highlighting any significant extensions and modifications.
In addition, the more generalised methods that have emerged within the last few
years are examined. These methods propose a more rigorous statistical framework
within which to determine the LF compared to some of the more traditional
methods. I also look at how photometric redshift estimations are being
incorporated into the LF methodology as well as considering the construction of
bivariate LFs. Finally, I review the ongoing development of completeness
estimators which test some of the fundamental assumptions going into LF
estimators and can be powerful probes of any residual systematic effects

accounts for correlations between different spatial scales in the initial
conditions. We provide numerical and analytical arguments showing how and why
both changes modify the predicted abundances substantially. In particular, we
show that the predicted importance of the void-in-cloud process depends
strongly on whether or not one accounts for correlations between scales. With
our new formulation, the void-in-cloud process dramatically reduces the
predicted abundances of voids if such correlations are ignored, but only
matters for the smallest voids in the more realistic case in which the spatial
correlations are included.

does not originate from coupling between structures, no particular periodic

we simulate WL distortions on a population of background galaxies due to a
large (~3000) sample of galaxy cluster haloes extracted from the Millennium
Simulation at z~0.2. This study takes into account the influence of shape
noise, cluster substructure and asphericity as well as correlated large-scale
structure, but not uncorrelated large-scale structure along the line of sight
and observational effects. We find a small, but non-negligble, negative median
bias in both mass and concentration at a level of ~5%, the exact value
depending both on cluster mass and radial survey range. Both the mass and
concentration derived from WL show considerable scatter about their true
values. This scatter has, even for the highest mass clusters of M200 > 10^14.8
M_sun, a level of ~30% and ~20% for concentration and mass respectively and
increases strongly with decreasing cluster mass. For a typical survey analysing
30 galaxies per arcmin^2 over a radial range from 30"" to 15' from the cluster
centre, the derived M200-c relation has a slope and normalisation too low
compared to the underlying true (3D) relation by ~40% and ~15% respectively.
The scatter and bias in mass are shown to reflect a departure at large radii of
the true WL shear/matter distribution of the simulated clusters from the NFW
profile adopted in modelling the mock observations. Orientation of the triaxial
cluster haloes dominates the concentration scatter (except at low masses, where
galaxy shape noise becomes dominant), while the bias in c is mostly due to
substructure within the virial radius.

to form gas giant planets \rev{such as} Jupiter and Saturn. We investigate the
core growth and the possibilities for cores to reach such a critical core mass.
At the late stage, planetary cores grow through collisions with small
planetesimals. Collisional fragmentation of planetesimals, which is induced by
gravitational interaction with planetary cores, reduces the amount of
planetesimals surrounding them, and thus the final core masses. Starting from
small planetesimals that the fragmentation rapidly removes, less massive cores
are formed. However, planetary cores acquire atmospheres that enlarge their
collisional cross section before rapid gas accretion. Once planetary cores
exceed about Mars mass, atmospheres significantly accelerate the growth of
cores. We show that, taking into account the effects of fragmentation and
atmosphere, initially large planetesimals enable formation of sufficiently
massive cores. On the other hand, because the growth of cores is slow for large
planetesimals, a massive disk is necessary for cores to grow enough within a
disk lifetime. If the disk with 100\,km-sized initial planetesimals is 10 times
as massive as the minimum mass solar nebula, planetary cores can exceed 10
Earth masses in the Jovian planet region ($>5\,$AU).

macroscopic objects. To this end, a mechanical resonator has to be cooled to
its ground state and its position has to be measured with great accuracy.
Currently, various routes to reach these goals are being explored. In this
review, we discuss different techniques for sensitive position detection and we
give an overview of the cooling techniques that are being employed. The latter
include sideband cooling and active feedback cooling. The basic concepts that
are important when measuring on mechanical systems with high accuracy and/or at
very low temperatures, such as thermal and quantum noise, linear response
theory, and backaction, are explained. From this, the quantum limit on linear
position detection is obtained and the sensitivities that have been achieved in
recent opto and nanoelectromechanical experiments are compared to this limit.
The mechanical resonators that are used in the experiments range from
meter-sized gravitational wave detectors to nanomechanical systems that can
only be read out using mesoscopic devices such as single-electron transistors
or superconducting quantum interference devices. A special class of
nanomechanical systems are bottom-up fabricated carbon-based devices, which
have very high frequencies and yet a large zero-point motion, making them ideal
for reaching the quantum regime. The mechanics of some of the different
mechanical systems at the nanoscale is studied. We conclude this review with an
outlook of how state-of-the-art mechanical resonators can be improved to study

But what is the least possible amount of communication required for a given
task? We formalize this question by introducing a new framework for distributed
computation, called {\em oblivious protocols}.
  We investigate the power of this model by considering two concrete examples,
the {\em musical chairs} task $MC(n,m)$ and the well-known {\em Renaming}
problem. The $MC(n,m)$ game is played by $n$ players (processors) with $m$
chairs. Players can {\em occupy} chairs, and the game terminates as soon as
each player occupies a unique chair. Thus we say that player $P$ is {\em in
conflict} if some other player $Q$ is occupying the same chair, i.e.,
termination means there are no conflicts. By known results from distributed
computing, if $m \le 2n-2$, no strategy of the players can guarantee
termination. However, there is a protocol with $m = 2n-1$ chairs that always
terminates. Here we consider an oblivious protocol where in every time step the
only communication is this: an adversarial {\em scheduler} chooses an arbitrary
nonempty set of players, and for each of them provides only one bit of
information, specifying whether the player is currently in conflict or not. A
player notified not to be in conflict halts and never changes its chair,
whereas a player notified to be in conflict changes its chair according to its
deterministic program. Remarkably, even with this minimal communication
termination can be guaranteed with only $m=2n-1$ chairs. Likewise, we obtain an
oblivious protocol for the Renaming problem whose name-space is small as that
of the optimal nonoblivious distributed protocol.
  Other aspects suggest themselves, such as the efficiency (program length) of
our protocols. We make substantial progress here as well, though many
interesting questions remain open.

is a number between 0 and 1. This number equals 1 when the Picard number is 1,

For abelian surfaces, it is 1/2 or 1, depending on the existence or not of

an automorphism gives an upper bound for the concordance, namely the ratio of
entropies in real and complex loci of X. Moreover the concordance is equal to
this ratio when the Picard number is 2. An interesting consequence of the
inequality is the non-density of the automorphisms in the group of
diffeomorphisms of the real surface X(R), as soon as the concordance is

with matter in the form of a gas of ultracold atoms: the atomic ensemble. We
present a theoretical analysis of two problems, which involve the interaction
of quantized electromagnetic fields (called signal and idler) with the atomic
ensemble (i) cascade two-photon emission in an atomic ladder configuration, and
(ii) photon frequency conversion in an atomic diamond configuration. The
motivation of these studies comes from potential applications in long-distance
quantum communication where it is desirable to generate quantum correlations
between telecommunication wavelength light fields and ground level atomic
coherences. We develop a theory of correlated signal-idler pair correlation.
The analysis is complicated by the possible generation of multiple excitations
in the atomic ensemble. An analytical treatment is given in the limit of a
single excitation assuming adiabatic laser excitations. The analysis predicts
superradiant timescales in the idler emission in agreement with experimental
observation. To relax the restriction of a single excitation, we develop a
different theory of cascade emission, which is solved by numerical simulation
of classical stochastic differential equation using the theory of open quantum
systems. The simulations are in good qualitative agreement with the analytical
theory of superradiant timescales. We provide a quantum theory of near-infrared
to telecom wavelength conversion in the diamond configuration. The system
provides a crucial part of a quantum-repeater memory element, which enables a
""stored"" near-infrared photon to be converted to a telecom wavelength for
transmission without the destruction of light-atom quantum correlation.

rescattering and potential interaction) which finally merge into a
comprehensive understanding of these interactions. We identify those

(e.g., C II and Si III). We identify three kinematic components with central
velocities ranging from ~-50 to ~-230 km/s. Velocity dependent, non-black
saturation is evident from the line profiles of the high ionization ions. From
the non-detection of absorption from a metastable level of C II, we are able to
determine that the electron number density in the main component of the outflow
is < 30 per cubic cm. Photoionization analysis yields an ionization parameter
log U ~ -1.6 +/- 0.2, which accounts for changes in the metallicity of the
outflow and the shape of the incident spectrum. We also consider solutions with
two ionization parameters. If the ionization structure of the outflow is due to
photoionization by the active galactic nucleus, we determine that the distance
to this component from the central source is > 3 kpc. Due to the large distance
determined for the main kinematic component, we discuss the possibility that
this outflow is part of a galactic wind.

in the connectivity of random networks is an outstanding challenge. Here we
show that a simple stochastic model of graph evolution leads to a discontinuous
percolation transition and we derive the underlying mechanism responsible:
growth by overtaking. Starting from a collection of $n$ isolated nodes,
potential edges chosen uniformly at random from the complete graph are examined
one at a time while a cap, $k$, on the maximum allowed component size is
enforced. Edges whose addition would exceed $k$ can be simply rejected provided
the accepted fraction of edges never becomes smaller than a function which
decreases with $k$ as $g(k) = 1/2 + (2k)^{-\beta}$. We show that if $\beta < 1$
it is always possible to reject a sampled edge and the growth in the largest
component is dominated by an overtaking mechanism leading to a discontinuous
transition. If $\beta > 1$, once $k \ge n^{1/\beta}$, there are situations when
a sampled edge must be accepted leading to direct growth dominated by
stochastic fluctuations and a ""weakly"" discontinuous transition. We also show
that the distribution of component sizes and the evolution of component sizes
are distinct from those previously observed and show no finite size effects for
the range of $\beta$ studied.

found to be log-periodic with a good accuracy, and the period is equal to the
scaling factor of the fractal. Here D and I(q) are the fractal dimension and
the scattering intensity, respectively. The number of periods of this curve
coincides with the number of fractal iterations. We show that the
log-periodicity of I(q)q^D in the momentum space is related to the
log-periodicity of the quantity g(r)r^{3-D} in the real space, where g(r) is
the pair distribution function. The minima and maxima positions of the
scattering intensity are estimated explicitly by relating them to the pair
distance distribution in the real space. It is shown that the minima and maxima
are damped with increasing polydispersity of the fractal sets; however, they
remain quite pronounced even at sufficiently large values of polydispersity. A
generalized self-similar Vicsek fractal with controllable fractal dimension is
introduced, and its scattering properties are studied to illustrate the above
findings. In contrast with the usual methods, the present analysis allows us to

theory of nuclear shadowing which is based on the combination of the
generalization of the Gribov-Glauber theory, QCD factorization theorems, and
the HERA QCD analysis of diffraction in lepton-proton deep inelastic scattering
(DIS). We apply this technique for the analysis of a wide range of hard
processes with nuclei---inclusive DIS on deuterons, medium-range and heavy
nuclei, coherent and incoherent diffractive DIS with nuclei, and hard
diffraction in proton-nucleus scattering---and make predictions for the effect
of nuclear shadowing in the corresponding sea quark and gluon parton
distributions. We also analyze the role of the leading twist nuclear shadowing
in generalized parton distributions in nuclei and in certain characteristics of
final states in nuclear DIS. We discuss the limits of applicability of the
leading twist approximation for small x scattering off nuclei and the onset of
the black disk regime and methods of detecting it. It will be possible to check
many of our predictions in the near future in the studies of the
ultraperipheral collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Further checks
will be possible in pA collisions at the LHC and forward hadron production at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Detailed tests will be possible at
an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) in the USA and at the Large Hadron-Electron
Collider (LHeC) at CERN.

use the observed optical to submillimeter spectral energy distribution (SED)
and estimates of the dynamical mass as observational constraints to derive the
star formation rate (SFR), the stellar mass, and age of these objects. An
important observational constraint neglected in the analysis is the mass of
dust giving rise to the IR emission. In this paper we add this constraint to
the analysis of AzTEC-3. Adopting an upper limit to the mass of stars and a
bolometric luminosity for this object, we construct stellar and chemical
evolutionary scenarios, constrained to produce the inferred dust mass and
observed luminosity before the associated stellar mass exceeds the
observational limit. We find that the model with a Top Heavy IMF provided the
most plausible scenario consistent with the observational constraints. In this
scenario the dust formed over a period of ~200 Myr, with a SFR of ~500 Msun/yr.
These values for the age and SFR in AzTEC-3 are significantly higher and lower,
respectively, from those derived without the dust mass constraint. However,
this scenario is not unique, and others cannot be completely ruled out because
of the prevailing uncertainties in the age of the galaxy, its bolometric
luminosity, and its stellar and dust masses. A robust result of our models is
that all scenarios require most of the radiating dust mass to have been
accreted in molecular clouds. Our new procedure highlights the importance of a
multiwavelength approach, and of the use of dust evolution models in
constraining the age and the star formation activity and history in galaxies.

polyhedral symmetry has been observed. On the basis of the experimental
phenomenology it was suggested [M. Dubois, V. Lizunov, A. Meister, T.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. Vol. 101, 15082 (2004)] that the mechanism for the
formation of bilayer polyhedra is minimization of elastic bending energy.
Motivated by these experiments, we study the elastic bending energy of
polyhedral bilayer vesicles. In agreement with experiments, and provided that
excess amphiphiles exhibiting spontaneous curvature are present in sufficient
quantity, we find that polyhedral bilayer vesicles can indeed be energetically
favorable compared to spherical bilayer vesicles. Consistent with experimental
observations we also find that the bending energy associated with the vertices
of bilayer polyhedra can be locally reduced through the formation of pores.
However, the stabilization of polyhedral bilayer vesicles over spherical
bilayer vesicles relies crucially on molecular segregation of excess
amphiphiles along the ridges rather than the vertices of bilayer polyhedra.
Furthermore, our analysis implies that, contrary to what has been suggested on
the basis of experiments, the icosahedron does not minimize elastic bending
energy among arbitrary polyhedral shapes and sizes. Instead, we find that, for
large polyhedron sizes, the snub dodecahedron and the snub cube both have lower
total bending energies than the icosahedron.

'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (SFGs) to study the metallicity
dependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}CO, from CO line luminosity to
molecular gas mass. The molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio of
the star formation rate (SFR) to CO luminosity, is ~1 Gyr-1 for near-solar
metallicity galaxies with stellar masses above M_S~1e11 M_sun. In this regime
the depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as a
function of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. Below
M_S the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. We argue
that this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physical
parameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamental
metallicity-SFR-stellar mass relation. A more probable explanation is that the
conversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in
'CO-dark' gas. The trend is also expected theoretically from the effect of
enhanced photodissociation of CO by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.
From the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of the
log({\alpha}CO) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairly
insensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.
Because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formation
activity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas masses
estimated from CO luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward for
galaxies below M_S.

Using a combination of series expansion (SE), based on the continuous unitary
transformation method and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) we
analyze the ground-state, the one-, and the two-particle excitations in the
regime of strong rung-coupling. We find several marked differences of the FFST
with respect to standard two-leg ladders. First we show that frustration
destabilizes the spin-gap phase of the FFST which is adiabatically connected to
the limit of decoupled rung singlets, leading to a first order quantum phase
transition at finite inter-rung coupling. Second, we show that apart from the
well-know triplon branch of spin-ladders, the FFST sustains additional
elementary excitations, including a singlon, and additional triplons. Finally
we find, that in the two-particle sector the FFST exhibits collective
(anti)bound states similar to two-leg ladders, however with a different
ordering of the spin-quantum numbers. We show that frustration has significant
impact on the FFST leading to a flattening of the ground-state energy
landscape, a mass-enhancement of the excitations, and to a relative enhancement
of the (anti)binding strength. Where possible we use DMRG to benchmark the
findings from our SE calculations, showing excellent agreement.

parametrically varied. Single chains containing one molecule in each layer, as
well as multi-chain structures in many layers are discussed and their energies
and radii determined. We extract the normal modes of the various systems as
measures of their volatility and eventually of instability, and compare our
findings to the excitations in crystals. We find modes that can be classified
as either chains vibrating in phase or as layers vibrating against each other.
The former correspond to acoustic and the latter to optical phonons.
Instabilities can occur for large intra-layer repulsion and produce diverging
amplitudes of molecules in the outer layers. Lastly, we consider experimentally
relevant regimes to observe the structures.
