presented. The control parameters are chosen such that there is a significant
variation of density of the gas in going from the bottom to the top of the
layer. The relations between the Rayleigh, Peclet and Nusselt numbers depend on
the density stratification. It is proposed to use a data reduction which
accounts for the variable density by introducing into the scaling laws an
effective density. The relevant density is the geometric mean of the maximum
and minimum densities in the layer. A good fit to the data is then obtained
with power laws with the same exponent as for fluids in the Boussinesq limit.
Two relations connect the top and bottom boundary layers: The kinetic energy
densities computed from free fall velocities are equal at the top and bottom,
and the products of free fall velocities and maximum horizontal velocities are
equal for both boundaries.

spurred interest in the phase behavior of polyhedral shapes. Regular tetrahedra
have attracted particular attention because they prefer local symmetries that
are incompatible with periodicity. Two dense phases of regular tetrahedra have
been reported recently. The densest known tetrahedron packing is achieved in a
crystal of triangular bipyramids (dimers) with packing density
4000/4671=85.63%. In simulation a dodecagonal quasicrystal is observed; its
approximant, with periodic tiling (3.4.3^2.4), can be compressed to a packing
fraction of 85.03%. Here, we show that the quasicrystal approximant is more
stable than the dimer crystal for packing densities below 84% using Monte Carlo
computer simulations and free energy calculations. To carry out the free energy
calculations, we use a variation of the Frenkel-Ladd method for anisotropic
shapes and thermodynamic integration. The enhanced stability of the approximant
can be attributed to a network substructure, which maximizes the free volume
(and hence the 'wiggle room') available to the particles and facilitates
correlated motion of particles, which further contributes to entropy and leads
to diffusion for packing densities below 65%. The existence of a solid-solid
transition between structurally distinct phases not related by symmetry
breaking -- the approximant and the dimer crystal-- is unusual for hard
particle systems.

probabilities in quantum theory make use of idealised models of clocks. An
interesting question is the extent to which the probabilities obtained in this
way are related to standard semiclassical results. In this paper we explore
this question using a reasonably general clock model, solved using path
integral methods. We find that in the weak coupling regime where the energy of
the clock is much less than the energy of the particle it is measuring, the
probability for the clock pointer can be expressed in terms of the probability
current in the case of arrival times, and the dwell time operator in the case
of dwell times, the expected semiclassical results. In the regime of strong
system-clock coupling, we find that the arrival time probability is
proportional to the kinetic energy density, consistent with an earlier model
involving a complex potential. We argue that, properly normalized, this may be
the generically expected result in this regime. We show that these conclusions
are largely independent of the form of the clock Hamiltonian.

together in driving a nearly self-similar expansion, without forming (hard)

populations is introduced. The population is divided into a fixed large number
of groups of fixed size. From generation to generation, new groups are formed
that descend from previous groups, through a two-level Fisher-Wright process,
with selection between groups and within groups and with migration between
groups at rate $m$. When $m=1$, the framework reduces to the often used
trait-group framework, so that our setting can be seen as an extension of that
approach. Our framework allows the analysis of previously introduced models in
which altruists and non-altruists compete, and provides new insights into these
models. We focus on the situation in which initially there is a single
altruistic allele in the population, and no further mutations occur. The main
questions are conditions for the viability of that altruistic allele to spread,
and the fashion in which it spreads when it does. Because our results and
methods are rigorous, we see them as shedding light on various controversial
issues in this field, including the role of Hamilton's rule, and of the Price
equation, the relevance of linearity in fitness functions and the need to only
consider pairwise interactions, or weak selection. In this paper we analyze the
early stages of the evolution, during which the number of altruists is small
compared to the size of the population. We show that during this stage the
evolution is well described by a multitype branching process. The driving
matrix for this process can be obtained, reducing the problem of determining
when the altruistic gene is viable to a comparison between the leading
eigenvalue of that matrix, and the fitness of the non-altruists before the
altruistic gene appeared. This leads to a generalization of Hamilton's
condition for the viability of a mutant gene.

all spacetimes (SPASs) is discussed. As there may be many answers to this
question, we isolate a necessary condition, the SPASs property, that should be
satisfied by any reasonable notion of SPASs. This requires that if two theories
conform to a common notion of SPASs, with one a subtheory of the other, and are
isomorphic in some particular spacetime, then they should be isomorphic in all
globally hyperbolic spacetimes (of given dimension). The SPASs property is
formulated in a functorial setting broad enough to describe general physical
theories describing processes in spacetime, subject to very minimal
assumptions. By explicit constructions, the full class of locally covariant
theories is shown not to satisfy the SPASs property, establishing that there is
no notion of SPASs encompassing all such theories. It is also shown that all
locally covariant theories obeying the time-slice property possess two local
substructures, one kinematical (obtained directly from the functorial
structure) and the other dynamical (obtained from a natural form of dynamics,
termed relative Cauchy evolution). The covariance properties of relative Cauchy
evolution and the kinematic and dynamical substructures are analyzed in detail.
Calling local covariant theories dynamically local if their kinematical and
dynamical local substructures coincide, it is shown that the class of
dynamically local theories fulfills the SPASs property. As an application in
quantum field theory, we give a model independent proof of the impossibility of
making a covariant choice of preferred state in all spacetimes, for theories
obeying dynamical locality together with typical assumptions.

that the Chern-Simons theory admits two distinct AdS_3 vacua with different
asymptotic W-algebra symmetries and central charges. We show that these vacua

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has revealed that the double-peaked component of
the broad H{\alpha} emission line profile is time variable, increasing by a
factor of 2.2 in brightness between 1999 and 2010. Modeling the gas
distribution responsible for the double-peaked profiles indicates that a ring
is a more appropriate description than a disk and most likely represents the
contrail of a red supergiant star that is being tidally disrupted at a distance
of ~ 1500 AU from the central black hole. There is also a bright core of broad
H{\alpha} line emission that is not time variable and identified with a large
scale inflow from an outer radius ~1 pc. If the gas number density is > 10^6
cm^{-3}, as suggested by the absence of similarly broad [O I] and [O III]
emission lines, then the steady state inflow rate is ~ 2 x 10^{-2}
M{_{\sun}}/yr which exceeds the inflow requirement to explain the X-ray
luminosity in terms of radiatively inefficient accretion by a factor of ~6. The
central AGN is unable to sustain ionization of the broad line region, the
discrepancy is particularly acute in 2010 when the broad H{\alpha} emission
line is dominated by the contrail of the in-falling supergiant star. However,
ram pressure shock ionization produced by the interaction of the in-falling
supergiant with the ambient interstellar medium may help alleviate the ionizing
deficit by generating a mechanical source of ionization supplementing the
photoionization provided by the AGN.

density waves -- in convective instability in discs. We analyse the linear
dynamics of non-axisymmetric convection and spiral density waves in a Keplerian
disc with superadiabatic vertical stratification using the local shearing box
approach. It is demonstrated that the shear associated with Keplerian
differential rotation introduces a novel phenomenon, it causes these two
perturbation modes to become coupled: during evolution the convective mode
generates (trailing) spiral density waves and can therefore be regarded as a
new source of spiral density waves in discs. The wave generation process
studied here owes its existence solely to shear of the disc's differential
rotation, and is a special manifestation of a more general linear mode coupling
phenomena universally taking place in flows with an inhomogeneous velocity
profile. We quantify the efficiency of spiral density wave generation by
convection as a function of azimuthal and vertical wavenumbers of these modes
and find that it is maximal and most powerful when both these length-scales are
comparable to the disc scale height. We also show that unlike the convective
mode, which tends to transport angular momentum inwards in the linear regime,
the spiral density waves transport angular momentum outwards. Based on these
findings, we suggest that in the non-linear regime spiral density waves
generated by convection may play a role in enhancing the transport of angular
momentum due the convective mode alone, which is actually being changed to
outward by non-linearity, as indicated by above-mentioned recent developments.

from electrons hopping across a trap. We extend previous studies of
noninteracting traps to the case where the traps have on-site electron
repulsion inside one ballistic channel. The repulsion not only allows the
appropriate temperature dependence of 1/f noise, but also is a control to the
coupling between the computational qubit and the spurious two-level systems

supersymmetric integrable hierarchy governing the Pohlmeyer reduction of
superstring sigma models on the target spaces AdS_{n}\times S^n, n=2,3,5. These
Poisson structures are all non-local and not relativistic except one, which is
the canonical Poisson structure of the semi-symmetric space sine-Gordon model
(SSSSG). We verify that the superposition of the first three Poisson structures
corresponds to the canonical Poisson structure of the reduced sigma model.
Using the recursion relations we construct commuting charges on the reduced
sigma model out of those of the SSSSG model and in the process we explain the
integrable origin of the Zukhovsky map and the twisted inner product used in
the sigma model side. Then, we compute the complete Poisson superalgebra for
the conserved Drinfeld-Sokolov supercharges associated to an exotic kind of
extended non-local rigid 2d supersymmetry recently introduced in the SSSSG
context. The superalgebra has a kink central charge which turns out to be a
generalization to the SSSSG models of the well-known central extensions of the
N=1 sine-Gordon and N=2 complex sine-Gordon model Poisson superalgebras
computed from 2d superspace. The computation is done in two different ways
concluding the proof of the existence of 2d supersymmetry in the reduced sigma
model phase space under the boost invariant SSSSG Poisson structure.

We show how any pure state in a non-Markovian open quantum system can be made
to behave as a pointer state by suitably engineering the coupling to the
environment via open-loop periodic control. Engineered pointer states are
constructed as approximate fixed points of the controlled open-system dynamics,
in such a way that they are guaranteed to survive over a long time with a
fidelity determined by the relative precision with which the dynamics is
engineered. We provide quantitative minimum-fidelity bounds by identifying
symmetry and ergodicity conditions that the decoherence-inducing perturbation
must obey in the presence of control, and develop explicit pulse sequences for
engineering any desired set of orthogonal states as pointer states. These
general control protocols are validated through exact numerical simulations as
well as semi-classical approximations in realistic single and two qubit
dissipative systems. We also examine the role of control imperfections, and
show that while pointer-state engineering protocols are highly robust in the
presence of systematic pulse errors, the latter can also lead to unintended
pointer-state generation in dynamical decoupling implementations, explaining
the initial-state selectivity observed in recent experiments.

the three-dimensional Lie algebra that describes the symmetry group of the

ordinary differential equations. The class A Bianchi models admit a Hamiltonian
formulation in which the components of the metric tensor and their time
derivatives yield the canonical coordinates. The evolution of anisotropy in the
vacuum Bianchi models is determined by a potential due to the curvature of the
model, according to its symmetry. For illustrative purposes, we examine the
evolution of anisotropy in models with Vlasov matter. The Vlasov content is
further simplified by the assumption of cold, counter-streaming matter, a kind
of matter that is far from thermal equilibrium and is not describable by an
ordinary fluid model nor other more simplistic matter models. Qualitative
differences and similarities are found in the dynamics of certain vacuum class
A Bianchi models and Bianchi Type I models with cold, counter-streaming Vlasov
matter potentials analogous to the curvature potentials of corresponding vacuum
models.

recent result from T2K experiment and will be precisely measured in the ongoing

environment- and redshift- dependence of accretion onto both halos and
subhalos. These objects grow in the simulation via mergers and via accretion of
diffuse non-halo material, and we measure the combined signal from these two
modes of accretion. It is found that the halo accretion rate varies less
strongly with redshift than predicted by the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS)
formalism and is dominated by minor-merger and diffuse accretion events at z=0,
for all halos. These latter growth mechanisms may be able to drive the
radio-mode feedback hypothesised for recent galaxy-formation models, and have
both the correct accretion rate and form of cosmological evolution. The low
redshift subhalo accretors in the simulation form a mass-selected subsample
safely above the mass resolution limit that reside in the outer regions of
their host, with ~70% beyond their host's virial radius, where they are
probably not being significantly stripped of mass. These subhalos accrete, on
average, at higher rates than halos at low redshift and we argue that this is
due to their enhanced clustering at small scales. At cluster scales, the mass
accretion rate onto halos and subhalos at low redshift is found to be only
weakly dependent on environment and we confirm that at z~2 halos accrete
independently of their environment at all scales, as reported by other authors.
By comparing our results with an observational study of black hole growth, we
support previous suggestions that at z>1, dark matter halos and their
associated central black holes grew coevally, but show that by the present day,
dark matter halos could be accreting at fractional rates that are up to a
factor 3-4 higher than their associated black holes.

another where the strong dynamics is solely responsible for electroweak

the absence of a Higgs boson below the LEP bound, solving the supersymmetry
naturalness problem. Quark and lepton masses arise from conventional Yukawa
couplings to elementary Higgs bosons, so there are no additional
flavor-changing effects associated with the strong dynamics. A good precision
electroweak fit can be obtained because the strong sector is an SU(2) gauge
theory with one weak doublet, and has adjustable parameters that control the
violation of custodial symmetry. In addition to the the standard supersymmetry
signals, these models predict production of multiple heavy standard model

global thermal equilibrium, with heating balancing cooling when averaged over
sufficiently long time- and length-scales; the ICM is, however, very likely to
be locally thermally unstable. Using simple observationally-motivated heating
prescriptions, we show that local thermal instability (TI) can produce a
multi-phase medium---with ~ 10000 K cold filaments condensing out of the hot
ICM---only when the ratio of the TI timescale in the hot plasma (t_{TI}) to the
free-fall timescale (t_{ff}) satisfies t_{TI}/t_{ff} <~ 10. This criterion
quantitatively explains why cold gas and star formation are preferentially
observed in low-entropy clusters and groups. In addition, the interplay among
heating, cooling, and TI reduces the net cooling rate and the mass accretion
rate at small radii by factors of ~ 100 relative to cooling-flow models. This
dramatic reduction is in line with observations. The feedback efficiency
required to prevent a cooling-flow is ~ 0.001 for clusters and decreases for
lower mass halos; supernova heating may be energetically sufficient to balance
cooling in galactic halos. We further argue that the ICM self-adjusts so that
t_{TI}/t_{ff} >~ 10 at all radii. When this criterion is not satisfied, cold
filaments condense out of the hot phase and reduce the density of the ICM.
These cold filaments can power the black hole and/or stellar feedback required
for global thermal balance, which drives t_{TI}/t_{ff} >~ 10. In comparison to
clusters, groups have central cores with lower densities and larger radii. This
can account for the deviations from self-similarity in the X-ray
luminosity-temperature (L_X-T_X) relation. The high-velocity clouds observed in
the Galactic halo can also be due to local TI producing multi-phase gas close
to the virial radius.

hole. Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the
origins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can clear wide inner
holes where single planets open only narrow gaps. Second, the confined,
non-axisymmetric accretion flows produced by multiple planets provide a way for
an arbitrary amount of mass transfer to occur through an apparently optically
thin hole without over-producing infrared excess flux. Rather than assuming the
gas and dust in the hole are evenly and axisymmetrically distributed, one can
construct an inner hole with apparently optically thin infrared fluxes by
covering a macroscopic fraction of the hole's surface area with locally
optically thick tidal tails. We also establish that other clearing mechanisms,
such as photoevaporation, cannot explain our subset of accreting transitional
disks with wide holes. Transitional disks are therefore high-value targets for

such extended infrared-opaque regions are found only in the nuclei of
ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We propose a model where the infrared-opaque
circumnuclear cloud, which is penetrated by the X-ray radiation field of the
QSO nucleus, contains clumps of massive star formation where the H2O emission
originates. The radiation pressure from the intense local infrared radiation
field exceeds the thermal gas pressure by about an order of magnitude,

reducing them to first order nonlinear equations. For the simplest galileon,
static solutions come on {\it six} distinct branches. On one, a Dyson sphere
surrounds itself with a galileon hair, which far away looks like a hair of any
Brans-Dicke field. The hair changes below the Vainshtein scale, where the extra
galileon terms dominate the minimal gradients of the field. Their hair looks
more like a fuzz, because the galileon terms are suppressed by the derivative
of the volume determinant. It shuts off the `hair bunching' over the `angular'
2-sphere. Hence the fuzz remains dilute even close to the source. This is
really why the Vainshtein's suppression of the modifications of gravity works
close to the source. On the other five branches, the static solutions are all
{\it singular} far from the source, and shuttered off from asymptotic infinity.
One of them, however, is really the self-accelerating branch, and the
singularity is removed by turning on time dependence. We give examples of
regulated solutions, where the Dyson sphere explodes outward, and its
self-accelerating side is nonsingular. These constructions may open channels
for nonperturbative transitions between branches, which need to be addressed

asymmetry to a dark matter asymmetry that relies on mass mixing which is
dynamically induced in the early universe. Such mixing can succeed with only
generic scales and operators and can give rise to distinctive relationships
between the asymmetries in the two sectors. The mixing eliminates the need for
the type of additional higher-dimensional operators that are inherent to many
current asymmetric dark matter models. We consider several implementations of
this idea. In one model, mass mixing is temporarily induced during a two-stage
electroweak phase transition in a two Higgs doublet model. In the other class
of models, mass mixing is induced by large field vacuum expectation values at

in contrast to conventional materials, the extraordinarily low electron-phonon
scattering1, 2 in graphene implies that disorder3-7 dominates its resistivity
even at room temperature. Charged impurities5, 8-10 have been identified as an
important disorder type in graphene on SiO2 substrates11, 12, giving a nearly
linear carrier-density-dependent conductivity {\sigma}(n), and producing
electron and hole puddles13-15 which determine the magnitude of graphene's
minimum conductivity {\sigma}min10. Correlations of charged impurities are
known to be essential in achieving the highest mobilities in remotely-doped
semiconductor heterostructures16-18, and are present to some degree in any
impurity system at finite temperature. Here we show that even modest
correlations in the position of charged impurities, realized by annealing
potassium on graphene, can increase the mobility by more than a factor of four.
The results are well understood theoretically19 considering an impurity
correlation length which is temperature dependent but independent of impurity
density. Impurity correlations also naturally explain the sub-linear
{\sigma}(n) commonly observed in substrate-bound graphene devices2, 11, 12, 20.

polarimetry provides important constraints on SiO maser astrophysics, including
the theory of polarized maser emission transport, and on the strength and

critical circumstellar region. We perform an analysis here of the data model
containing the instrumental factors that limit the accuracy of circular

data reduction algorithm for their correction. The algorithm is an enhancement
of existing spectral line VLBI polarimetry methods using autocorrelation data
for calibration, but with innovations in bandpass determination,
autocorrelation polarization self-calibration, and general optimizations for
the case of low SNR, as applicable at these wavelengths. We present an example
data reduction at $\lambda=7$ mm and derive an estimate of the predicted
accuracy of the method of m_c < 0.5% or better at lambda=7 mm and m_c < 0.5-1%

investigated and used to study the meson spectrum at zero temperature, as well
as the chiral phase transition in finite-temperature QCD. First, the
application of sophisticated matrix algorithms to the numerical solution of
both the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and the inhomogeneous vertex
BSE is discussed, and the advantages of these methods are described in detail.
Turning to the finite temperature formalism, the rainbow-truncated quark
Dyson-Schwinger equation is used to investigate the impact of different forms
of the effective interaction on the chiral transition temperature. A strong
model dependence and no overall correlation of the value of the transition
temperature to the strength of the interaction is found. Within one model,
however, such a correlation exists and follows an expected pattern. In the
context of the BSE at zero temperature, a representation of the inhomogeneous
vertex BSE and the quark-antiquark propagator in terms of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the homogeneous BSE is given. Using the rainbow-ladder
truncation, this allows to establish a connection between the bound-state poles
in the quark-antiquark propagator and the behavior of eigenvalues of the
homogeneous BSE, leading to a new extrapolation technique for meson masses.
This is used to study the ground- and excited-state meson spectrum for all
quark masses from light to bottom, for pseudoscalar, scalar, vector,
axialvector and tensor mesons. Good agreement with experiment is found, e.g.,
for all ground states in the bottomonium system. In addition, new applications
of the inhomogeneous vertex BSE, such as the possibility to calculate on-shell
quantities like decay constants, are investigated. Finally, we study the
influence of the infrared behavior of the effective interaction on properties
of pi and rho mesons.

solution. Following the Brown-York approach with suitable counterterms, it is
shown that the soliton possesses a fixed negative mass which coincides with the
one of AdS spacetime regardless the value of the integration constant that
describes it. Hence, the soliton can be naturally regarded as a degenerate
ground state labeled by a single modulus parameter. The Euclidean action,
endowed with suitable counterterms, is shown to be finite and independent of
modulus and hair parameters for both classes of solutions, and in the case of
hairy black holes the free energy in the semiclassical approximation is
reproduced. Modular invariance allows to show that the gravitational hair turns
out to be determined by the modulus parameter. According to Cardy's formula, it
is shown that the semiclassical entropy agrees with the microscopic counting of
states provided the modulus parameter of the ground state is spontaneously
fixed, which suggests that the hairy black hole is in a broken phase of the
theory. Indeed, it is found that there is a critical temperature characterizing
a first order phase transition between the static hairy black hole and the

This system can be formally solved for any external force, providing the
ratchet velocity as a non-linear functional of the driving force. This allows
us to explicitly illustrate the functional Taylor expansion formalism recently
proposed for this kind of systems. The Taylor expansion reveals particularly
useful to obtain the shape of the current when the force is periodic, piecewise
constant. We also illustrate the somewhat counterintuitive effect that
introducing damping may induce a ratchet effect. When the force is symmetric
under time-reversal and the system is undamped, under symmetry principles no
ratchet effect is possible. In this situation increasing damping generates a
ratchet current which, upon increasing the damping coefficient eventually
reaches a maximum and decreases toward zero. We argue that this effect is not

damping driven by a time-reversible external force.

exploits contextual independence in terms of parent contexts; which variables
act as parents may depend on the value of other variables. The internal
representation is in terms of contextual factors (confactors) that is simply a
pair of a context and a table. The algorithm, contextual variable elimination,
is based on the standard variable elimination algorithm that eliminates the
non-query variables in turn, but when eliminating a variable, the tables that
need to be multiplied can depend on the context. This algorithm reduces to
standard variable elimination when there is no contextual independence
structure to exploit. We show how this can be much more efficient than variable
elimination when there is structure to exploit. We explain why this new method
can exploit more structure than previous methods for structured belief network
inference and an analogous algorithm that uses trees.

When the number of states is large, succinct representations are often used to
compactly represent both the MDPs and the policies in a reduced amount of
space. In this paper, some problems related to the size of succinctly
represented policies are analyzed. Namely, it is shown that some MDPs have
policies that can only be represented in space super-polynomial in the size of
the MDP, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. This fact motivates the
study of the problem of deciding whether a given MDP has a policy of a given

a succinct representation of a value function of a given size and reward is

estimated by comparing the limiting cases that those phases have a vanishing

estimate the effect on torsional crustal vibrations and on the maximum
quadrupole ellipticity sustainable by the crust. The crust composition and
transition densities are calculated consistently with the global properties,
using a liquid drop model with a bulk nuclear equation of state (EoS) which
allows a systematic variation of the nuclear symmetry energy. The symmetry
energy J and its density dependence L at nuclear saturation density are the
dominant nuclear inputs which determine the thickness of the crust, the range
of densities at which pasta might appear, as well as global properties such as
the radius and moment of inertia. We show the importance of calculating the
global neutron star properties on the same footing as the crust EoS, and
demonstrate that in the range of experimentally acceptable values of L, the
pasta phase can alter the crust frequencies by up to a factor of three,
exceeding the effects of superfluidity on the crust modes, and decrease the
maximum quadrupole ellipticity sustainable by the crust by up to an order of
magnitude. The signature of the pasta phases and the density dependence of the
symmetry energy on the potential observables highlights the possibility of
constraining the EoS of dense, neutron-rich matter and the properties of the
pasta phases using astrophysical observations.

compare the stopping power of the plasma oscillations for these two

light whose frequency and intensity can be varied to yield an energy gap of
several hundred $\texttt{meV}$ between the valence and conduction bands. The
dressed states of the Dirac electrons by the photons yield collective plasma
excitations whose characteristics are qualitatively and quantitatively
different from those produced by Dirac fermions in gapless graphene, due in
part to the finite effective mass of the dressed electrons. For example, the
range of wave numbers for undamped self-sustaining plasmons is increased as the
gap is increased, thereby increasing the stopping power of graphene for some
range of charged particle velocity when graphene is radiated by circularly
polarized light.

paper. We propose that the radiation produced by energetic particles in
small-scale magnetic field turbulence, which can occur in laser-plasma
experiments, collisionless shocks, and during magnetic reconnection, can be
used to deduce some properties of the turbulent magnetic field. Particles
propagating through such turbulence encounter locally strong magnetic fields,
but over lengths much shorter than a particle gyroradius. Consequently, the
particle is accelerated but not deviated substantially from a straight line
path. We develop the general jitter radiation solutions for this case and show
that the resulting radiation is directly dependent upon the spectral
distribution of the magnetic field through which the particle propagates. We
demonstrate the power of this approach in considering the radiation produced by
particles moving through a region in which a (Weibel-like) filamentation
instability grows magnetic fields randomly oriented in a plane transverse to
counterstreaming particle populations. We calculate the spectrum as would be
seen from the original particle population and as could be seen by using a
quasi-monoenergetic electron beam to probe the turbulent region at various
angles to the filamentation axis.

search the large volume of life science datasets in the public domain, as
demonstrated by well-known linked data projects such as LODD, Bio2RDF, and
Chem2Bio2RDF. Integration of these sets creates large networks of information.
We have previously described a tool called WENDI for aggregating information
pertaining to new chemical compounds, effectively creating evidence paths
relating the compounds to genes, diseases and so on. In this paper we examine
the utility of automatically inferring new compound-disease associations (and
thus new links in the network) based on semantically marked-up versions of
these evidence paths, rule-sets and inference engines.
  Results Through the implementation of a semantic inference algorithm, rule
set, Semantic Web methods (RDF, OWL and SPARQL) and new interfaces, we have
created a new tool called Chemogenomic Explorer that uses networks of
ontologically annotated RDF statements along with deductive reasoning tools to
infer new associations between the query structure and genes and diseases from
WENDI results. The tool then permits interactive clustering and filtering of
these evidence paths.
  Conclusions We present a new aggregate approach to inferring links between
chemical compounds and diseases using semantic inference. This approach allows
multiple evidence paths between compounds and diseases to be identified using a
rule-set and semantically annotated data, and for these evidence paths to be
clustered to show overall evidence linking the compound to a disease. We
believe this is a powerful approach, because it allows compound-disease
relationships to be ranked by the amount of evidence supporting them.

For such deformed superalgebras we point out the possibility of zero step
supermultiplets, carried on a single, irreducible representation of the even

such irreducible (unitary) representations correspond to standard conformal

These equations are derived from an uncontrolled, second-order truncation of

accuracy remains to be clarified. We use the system-size expansion to show that
chemical Fokker-Planck estimates of the mean concentrations and of the variance
of the concentration fluctuations about the mean are accurate to order
$\Omega^{-3/2}$ for reaction systems which do not obey detailed balance and at
least accurate to order $\Omega^{-2}$ for systems obeying detailed balance,
where $\Omega$ is the characteristic size of the system. Hence the chemical
Fokker-Planck equation turns out to be more accurate than the linear-noise
approximation of the chemical master equation (the linear Fokker-Planck
equation) which leads to mean concentration estimates accurate to order
$\Omega^{-1/2}$ and variance estimates accurate to order $\Omega^{-3/2}$. This
higher accuracy is particularly conspicuous for chemical systems realized in
small volumes such as biochemical reactions inside cells. A formula is also
obtained for the approximate size of the relative errors in the concentration
and variance predictions of the chemical Fokker-Planck equation, where the
relative error is defined as the difference between the predictions of the
chemical Fokker-Planck equation and the master equation divided by the
prediction of the master equation. For dimerization and enzyme-catalyzed
reactions, the errors are typically less than few percent even when the
steady-state is characterized by merely few tens of molecules.

(NLS1) galaxies, and present a summary of our previous results, and new
results. In particular, we have previously shown that (1) the locus of NLS1
galaxies on the M_BH-sigma_[OIII] plane does follow the relation of non-active
galaxies after removing objects obviously dominated by outflows as evidenced by
their [OIII] core blueshifts. We have (2) identified a number of so-called
'blue outliers' with large outflow velocities revealed by their emission-line
kinematic shifts. We also (3) present new correlations and trends which link
black hole mass, Eddington ratio and physical parameters of the emission-line
regions.

761 type 1 AGN, selected from a cross-correlation of the SDSS DR5 quasar
catalogue and the incremental version of the second XMM-Newton serendipitous
X-ray source catalogue 2XMMi-DR2. The X-ray spectrum of each source is fit with
models based on a simple power law to which additional cold absorption and/or
soft excess features are added if an F-test at 99% significance requires them.
The distribution of best-fitting photon indices, Gamma, is fit with a Gaussian
with mean <gamma> = 1.99 +/- 0.01 and dispersion sigma = 0.30 +/- 0.01, however
this does not provide a good representation of the distribution due to sources
with very flat or steep gamma values. A highly significant trend for decreasing
gamma values with increasing 2-10 keV luminosity, L_X, is seen but only a weak
trend with redshift is found. Intrinsic cold absorption is detected in ~4% of
the sample and soft excess emission is detected in ~8%. These values are lower
limits due to the detectability being limited by the quality of the spectra and
we suggest the intrinsic values may be as high as ~25% and ~80% respectively.
The levels of rest-frame absorption are higher than expected for type 1 objects
(N_H = 10^21-10^23 cm^-2) and the fraction of absorbed sources and the N_H
values are not seen to vary with L_X or z. The average blackbody temperature
used to model the soft excesses is <kT> = 0.17 +/- 0.09 keV. This temperature
is found to correlate with L_X but not the blackbody luminosity or the black
hole mass which do correlate with each other. A strong correlation is found
between the luminosities in the blackbody and power law components suggesting
that a similar fraction is re-processed from the blackbody to the power law
component for the entire luminosity range of objects. . . [Abridged]

HST and Subaru imaging data, which provide an accurate luminosity profile of
the cluster, we investigate the validity of a large set of dynamical models of
the system, which are checked for stability via N-body simulations. We find
that isotropic models in either Newtonian or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)
are ruled out with extremely high confidence. However, a simple Michie model in
Newtonian gravity with anisotropic velocity dispersion provides an excellent
representation of the luminosity profile and kinematics. In contrast, with MOND
we find that Michie models that reproduce the luminosity profile either
over-predict the velocity dispersion on the outskirts of the cluster if the
mass to light ratio is kept at astrophysically-motivated values, or else they
under-predict the central velocity dispersion if the mass to light ratio is
taken to be very small. We find that the best Michie model in MOND is a factor
of 10000 less likely than the Newtonian model that best fits the system. A
likelihood ratio of 350 is found when we investigate more general models by
solving the Jeans equation with a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo scheme. We verified
with N-body simulations that these results are not significantly different when
the MOND external field effect is accounted for. If the assumptions that the
cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, spherical, not on a peculiar orbit, and
possesses a single dynamical tracer population of constant M/L are correct, we
conclude that the present observations provide a very severe challenge for
MOND. [abridged]

is $eV(0)\simeq m_\pi c^2$ and the system is intrinsically stable against
Coulomb repulsion in the proton component. This approach is necessary, but not

provide a generalized method to develop new criteria. For this purpose, by
studying some key facts and observations of signature-based algorithms, a

investigated. There was a conjecture by Cannas et. al. that the mean-field
theory is exact for spin systems with non-additive long-range interactions.
This is called ""exactness of the mean-field theory"". We show that the exactness
of the mean-field theory holds for systems on a lattice with non-additive two
body long-range interactions in the canonical ensemble with non-fixed order
parameters. We also show that in canonical ensemble with fixed order parameters
(e.g. lattice gas model with a fixed number of particles), exactness of the
mean-field theory does not hold in some parameter region, which we call ""non-MF
region"". In the non-MF region, an inhomogeneous configuration appears contrary
to the uniform configuration in the region where the mean-field theory holds.
This inhomogeneous configuration is not the one given by the standard phase
separation. Therefore, the mean-field picture is not adequate to describe these
states. We discuss phase transitions between the MF region and the non-MF
region. Exactness of the mean-field theory in spin glasses is also discussed.

other effects they cause a difference between the projected barycentre and
photocentre. The evolution of those surface features makes this difference
time-dependent. In some cases, e. g. for supergiant stars, the displacement can
be a non-negligible fraction of the star radius R, and if R>1 AU, of the
parallax. We investigate the impact of surface brightness asymmetries on both
the Gaia astrometric solution and the data processing flow with a theoretical
approach. We show that when the amplitude of the displacement is comparable to
the epoch astrometric precision, the resulting astrometric solution of a
genuine single star may be, in some cases, of low quality (with some parameters
up to 10 sigma off). In this case, we provide an analytical prediction of the
impact of the photocentre motion on both chi squared and the uncertainty in the
astrometric parameters. Non-single star solutions are found, if allowed for the
closest stars. A closer look at the parameters of the orbital solutions reveals
however that they are spurious (since the semi-major axis is smaller than
either its error or the stellar radius). It is thus possible to filter out
those spurious orbital solutions. Interestingly, for the stocastic solutions,
the stochastic noise appears to be a good estimate of the photocentric noise.

passed its T Tau phase and is spinning up approaching the ZAMS. Its high level
of chromospheric activity is indicated by the radiative losses in CaII H&K and
IRT, Halpha, and Hbeta lines. Furthermore, its Balmer decrement and the flux
ratio of CaII IRT lines imply that these lines are mainly formed in
optically-thick sources analogue to solar plages. The analysis of the Kepler
data uncovers evidence of at least 7 enduring spots. Since the star's
inclination is rather high, ~70{\deg}, the assignment of the spots to the
northern/southern hemisphere is not unambiguous. We find at least 3 solutions
with nearly the same level of residuals. The distribution of the active regions
is such that the spots are located around 3 latitude belts, i.e. the equator
and +-(50{\deg}-60{\deg}), with the high-latitude spots rotating slower than
the low-latitude ones. The equator-to-pole differential rotation ~0.27 rad/d is
at variance with some recent mean-field models of differential rotation in
rapidly rotating MS stars, which predict a much smaller latitudinal shear. Our
results are consistent with the scenario of a higher differential rotation,
which changes along the magnetic cycle.

a broad range of stellar masses and luminosities. To constrain the impact of
the helium content on RR Lyrae properties, we adopted two observables --period
distribution, luminosity amplitudes-- that are independent of distance and
reddening. The current predictions confirm that the helium content has a
marginal effect on the pulsation properties. The key parameter causing the
difference between canonical and He-enhanced observables is the luminosity. We
compared current predictions with the sample of 189 RR Lyrae stars in omega Cen
and we found that the period range of He-enhanced models is systematically
longer than observed. These findings apply to metal-poor and metal-intermediate
He-enhanced models. To further constrain the impact of He-enhanced structures
on the period distribution we also computed a series of synthetic HB models and
we found that the predicted period distribution, based on a Gaussian sampling
in mass, agrees quite well with observations. This applies not only to the
minimum fundamentalized period of RR Lyrae stars (0.39 vs 0.34 day), but also
to the fraction of Type II Cepheids (2% vs 3%). We also computed a series of
synthetic HB models assuming a mixed HB population in which the 80% is made of
canonical HB structures, while the 20% is made of He-enhanced (Y=0.30) HB

eigenoscillations for representative magnetohydro- dynamic models of filaments.
To date, highly idealized models for prominences have been used, especially
with respect to the overall magnetic configurations.
  Aims. We initiate a more systematic survey of filament wave modes, where we
consider full multi-dimensional models with twisted magnetic fields
representative of the surrounding magnetic flux rope. This requires the ability
to compute accurate 2.5 dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibria that balance
Lorentz forces, gravity, and pressure gradients, while containing density
enhancements (static or in motion).
  Methods. The governing extended Grad-Shafranov equation is discussed, along
with an analytic prediction for circular flux ropes for the Shafranov shift of
the central magnetic axis due to gravity. Numerical equilibria are computed
with a finite element-based code, demonstrating fourth order accuracy on an
explicitly known, non-trivial test case.
  Results. The code is then used to construct more realistic prominence
equilibria, for all three possible choices of a free flux-function. We quantify
the influence of gravity, and generate cool condensations in hot cavities, as
well as multi- layered prominences.
  Conclusions. The internal flux rope equilibria computed here have the
prerequisite numerical accuracy to allow a yet more advanced analysis of the
complete spectrum of linear magnetohydrodynamic perturbations, as will be
demonstrated in the companion paper.

condensations, we initiate a systematic survey of their linear
eigenoscillations. To quantify the full spectrum of linear MHD eigenmodes, we
require knowledge of all flux-surface localized modes, charting out the
continuous parts of the MHD spectrum. We combine analytical and numerical
findings for the continuous spectrum for realistic prominence configurations.
The equations governing all eigenmodes for translationally symmetric,
gravitating equilibria containing an axial shear flow, are analyzed, along with
their flux-surface localized limit. The analysis is valid for general 2.5D
equilibria, where either density, entropy, or temperature vary from one flux
surface to another. We analyze the mode couplings caused by the poloidal
variation in the flux rope equilibria, by performing a small gravity parameter
expansion. We contrast the analytical results with continuous spectra obtained
numerically. For equilibria where the density is a flux function, we show that
continuum modes can be overstable, and we present the stability criterion for
these convective continuum instabilities. Furthermore, for all equilibria, a
four-mode coupling scheme between an Alfvenic mode of poloidal mode number m
and three neighboring (m-1, m, m+1) slow modes is identified, occurring in the
vicinity of rational flux surfaces. For realistically prominence equilibria,
this coupling is shown to play an important role, from weak to stronger gravity
parameter g values. The analytic predictions for small g are compared with
numerical spectra, and progressive deviations for larger g are identified. The
unstable continuum modes could be relevant for short-lived prominence
configurations. The gaps created by poloidal mode coupling in the continuous
spectrum need further analysis, as they form preferred frequency ranges for
global eigenoscillations.

Greater overturning compensates for reduced radiative energy transfer

expected to raise the altitude from where planetary bulk heat loss takes place
according to the heuristic model, and an estimated trend of 40m/decade is
consistent with a surface warming rate of 0.2K/decade. The simple comprehensive
model of the greenhouse effect can also account for feedback processes, changes
in the hydrological cycle, and may assist the wider scientific community in
understanding of the main principles involved.

conditions hence are referred to as free energy transducers. They can be
formally considered as enzymes that simultaneously catalyze two chemical
reactions: the free energy-donating reaction and the free energy-accepting one.
Most if not all biologically active proteins display a slow stochastic dynamics
of transitions between a variety of conformational substates composing their
native state. In the steady state, this dynamics is characterized by mean
first-passage times between transition substates of the catalyzed reactions. On
taking advantage of the assumption that each reaction proceeds through a single
pair (the gate) of conformational transition substates of the enzyme-substrates
complex, analytical formulas were derived for the flux-force dependence of the
both reactions, the respective stalling forces and the degree of coupling
between the free energy-accepting (output) reaction flux and the free
energy-donating (input) one. The theory is confronted with the results of
random walk simulations on the 5-dimensional hypercube. The formal proof is
given that in the case of reactions proceeding through single gates, the degree
of coupling cannot exceed unity. As some experiments suggest such exceeding,
looking for conditions of increasing the degree of coupling over unity
challenges theory. Though no analytical formulas for models involving more
transition substates are available, study simulations of random walks on
several model networks indicate that the case of the degree of coupling value
higher than one occurs in a natural way for scale-free tree-like networks. This
supports a hypothesis that the protein conformational transition networks, like
higher level biological networks: the proteome and the metabolome, have evolved
in a process of self-organized criticality.

from a geometrically thin optically thick accretion disk (AD). The AD produces
the ionizing continuum which powers the broad and narrow emission lines. The
maximum AD effective temperature is given by Teff=fmax(Mdot/M^2)^1/4, where M
is the black hole mass, Mdot the accretion rate, and fmax is set by the black
hole spin a_*. For a low enough value of Mdot/M^2 the AD may become too cold to
produce ionizing photons. Such an object will form a lineless quasar. This
occurs for a local blackbody (BB) AD with a luminosity Lopt=10^46 erg/s for
M>3.6E9 Msun, when a_*=0, and for M>1.4E10 Msun, when a_*=0.998. Using the AD
based Mdot, derived from M and Lopt, and the reverberation based M, derived
from Lopt and the Hbeta FWHM, v, gives Teff \propto Lopt^-0.13v^-1.45. Thus,
Teff is mostly set by v. Quasars with a local BB AD become lineless for v>
8,000 km/s, when a_*=0, and for v> 16,000 km/s, when a_*=0.998. Higher values
of v are required if the AD is hotter than a local BB. The AD becoming
non-ionizing may explain why line emitting quasars with v>10,000 km/s are rare.
Weak low ionization lines may still be present if the X-ray continuum is
luminous enough, and such objects may form a population of weak emission line
quasars (WLQ). If correct, such WLQ should show a steeply falling SED at
lambda<1000A. Such an SED was observed by Hryniewicz et al. in SDSS
J094533.99+100950.1, a WLQ observed down to 570A, which is well modeled by a
rather cold AD SED. UV spectroscopy of z~1-2 quasars is required to eliminate
potential intervening Lyman limit absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM),
and to explore if the SEDs of lineless quasars and some additional WLQ are also
well fit by a cold AD SED.

radius is 100 m and is comparable to the polar cap radius. If a closed
magnetosphere is filled with a dense plasma, then lightnings are efficiently
formed only in the region of open magnetic field lines. For the radio emission
from a separate lightning to be observed, the polar cap of the neutron star
must be directed toward the observer and, at the same time, the lightning must
be formed. The maximum burst rate is related to the time of the plasma outflow
from the polar cap region. The typical interval between two consecutive bursts
is ~100 s. The width of a single radio burst can be determined both by the
width of the emission cone formed by the lightning emitting regions at some
height above the neutron star surface and by a finite lightning lifetime. The
width of the phase distribution for radio bursts from RRATs, along with the
integrated pulse width, is determined by the width of the bundle of open

calculation with the Gutzwiller wave function optimizing numerically the
ground-state energy and (ii) exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian for short
chains. The f-level occupancy and the renormalization factor of the
quasiparticles are calculated as a function of the energy of the f-orbital for

agreement is maintained even when the interaction between band electrons, U_d,

explained by the difference between the physics of the one- and higher
dimensional models. We find that this interaction shifts and widens the energy
range of the bare f-level, where heavy-fermion behavior can be observed. For
large enough U_d this range may lie even above the bare conduction band. The
Gutzwiller method indicates a robust transition from Kondo insulator to Mott

gravity wave near the centre of a solar-type star in two-dimensions. The
motivation is to understand the tidal interaction between short-period planets
and their solar-type host stars, which involves the launching of gravity waves
at the top of the radiation zone that propagate towards the stellar centre.
Studying the instabilities of these waves near the centre, where nonlinearities
are most important, is essential, since it may have implications for the
survival of these planets. When the waves have sufficient amplitude to overturn
the stratification, they break and form a critical layer, which efficiently
absorbs subsequent ingoing wave angular momentum, and can result in the planet
spiralling into the star. However, previous simulations do not find the waves
to undergo instability for smaller amplitudes. This work has two aims: to
determine any instabilities that set in for small-amplitude waves, and to
further understand the breaking of large-amplitude waves. Our main result is
that the waves undergo parametric instabilities for any amplitude. However,
because the nonlinearity is spatially localised in the innermost wavelengths,
their growth rates are sufficiently small that they do not result in
astrophysically important tidal dissipation. The resulting modified tidal
quality factors are estimated to be Q'_star>10^7, and possibly much greater, so
the dissipation is much weaker than that which results from critical-layer
absorption. These results support our explanation for the survival of all
currently observed short-period planets around solar-type main-sequence stars:
that planets unable to cause wave breaking at the centre of their host stars
are likely to survive against tidal decay. This hypothesis will be tested by
ongoing and future observations of transiting planets, such as WASP and Kepler.

(sub-station), however, voltage anywhere further down the line is subject to
fluctuations, caused by irregularities of real and reactive distributed power
consumption/generation. The lack of a direct control of voltage along the line
may result in the voltage instability, also called voltage collapse -
phenomenon well known and documented in the power engineering literature.
Motivated by emerging photo-voltaic technology, which brings a new source of
renewable generation but also contributes significant increase in power flow
fluctuations, we reexamine the phenomenon of voltage stability and collapse. In
the limit where the number of consumers is large and spatial variations in
power flows are smooth functions of position along the feeder, we derive a set
of the power flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), verify phenomenon of
voltage collapse, and study the effect of disorder and irregularity in
injection and consumption on the voltage profile by simulating the stochastic
ODE. We observe that disorder leads to nonlinear amplification of the voltage
variations at the end of the line as the point of voltage collapse is
approached. We also find that the disorder, when correlated on a scale
sufficiently small compared to the length of the line, self-averages, i.e. the
voltage profile remains spatially smooth for any individual realization of the
disorder and is correlated only at scales comparable to the length of the line.
Finally, we explain why the integrated effect of disorder on the voltage at the
end of the line cannot be described within a naive one-generator-one-load

combined with the existence of higher order terms in an effective field theory
expansion allows one to find scales below the effective field theory cut off
where two or a higher number of the potential derivatives may vanish. As an
explicit example, we demonstrate that inflection point inflation within a broad
range of scales O(TeV) << H < 3 x 10^9 GeV can be accommodated within weak
scale supersymmetry. The fine tuning of model parameters needed for successful
inflation is considerably improved in this scenario.

with respect of enhancement for the fingerprint images. In this paper we
develop a novel method for Fingerprint image contrast enhancement technique
based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition
(SVD) has been proposed. This technique is compared with conventional image
equalization techniques such as standard general histogram equalization and
local histogram equalization. An automatic histogram threshold approach based
on a fuzziness measure is presented. Then, using an index of fuzziness, a
similarity process is started to find the threshold point. A significant
contrast between ridges and valleys of the best, medium and poor finger image
features to extract from finger images and get maximum recognition rate using
fuzzy measures. The experimental results show the recognition of superiority of
the proposed method to get maximum performance up gradation to the
implementation of this approach.

limiting distribution, by means of certain results (of independent interest) on
Chebyshev polynomials; we also prove that the reductions modulo an arbitrary
prime of these classes are asymptotically equidistributed, and we study the
deviation from equidistribution. We extend our techniques to a more general
setting and use them to study the statistical properties of long cycles (and
paths) on regular (directed and undirected) graphs. We return to the free group
to study some growth functions of the number of conjugacy classes as a function
of their cyclically reduced length.

present an operator calculus formulation of the Krawtchouk transform that is
suitable for computer implementation. A positivity result for the Krawtchouk
transform is shown. Then our approach is compared with the use of the
Krawtchouk transform in coding theory where it appears in MacWilliams' and
Delsarte's theorems on weight enumerators. We conclude with a construction of
Krawtchouk polynomials in an arbitrary finite number of variables, orthogonal
with respect to the multinomial distribution.
