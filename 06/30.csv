polarization modulator (VPM). The VPM modulates polarization via a variable
separation between a polarizing grid and a parallel mirror. We find that in the
limit where the wavelength is much larger than the diameter of the metal wires
that comprise the grid, the phase delay derived from the geometric separation
between the mirror and the grid is sufficient to characterize the device.
However, outside of this range, additional parameters describing the polarizing
grid geometry must be included to fully characterize the modulator response. In
this paper, we report test results of a VPM at wavelengths of 350 microns and 3
mm. Electromagnetic simulations of wire grid polarizers were performed and are
summarized using a simple circuit model that incorporates the loss and
polarization properties of the device.

while they are well-founded in theory, independent verification and calibration
of these models, including the exploration of possible degeneracies between
their parameters, are rarely made. As a consequence, a robust fitting method
that leads to unique and reproducible results has been lacking. Here we
introduce a novel approach based on Bayesian analysis to fit the Spitzer-IRS
spectra of starbursts using the SED models proposed by Groves et al. (2008). We
demonstrate its capabilities and verify the agreement between the derived best
fit parameters and actual physical conditions by modelling the nearby,
well-studied, giant HII region 30 Dor in the LMC. The derived physical
parameters, such as cluster mass, cluster age, ISM pressure and covering
fraction of photodissociation regions, are representative of the 30 Dor region.
The inclusion of the emission lines in the modelling is crucial to break
degeneracies. We investigate the limitations and uncertainties by modelling
sub-regions, which are dominated by single components, within 30 Dor. A
remarkable result for 30 Doradus in particular is a considerable contribution
to its mid-infrared spectrum from hot ({\simeq} 300K) dust. The demonstrated
success of our approach will allow us to derive the physical conditions in more
distant, spatially unresolved starbursts.

the matrix equations that arise in a wide variety of applications, including
discretized partial differential equations. It automatically constructs a
sequence of increasingly smaller matrix problems that enable efficient
resolution of all scales present in the solution. One of the main components of
the method is an adequate choice of coarse grids. The current coarsening
methodology is based on measuring how a so-called algebraically smooth error
value at one point depends on the error values at its neighbors. Such a concept
of strength of connection is well understood for operators whose principal part
is an M-matrix; however, the strength concept for more general matrices is not
yet clearly understood, and this lack of knowledge limits the scope of AMG
applicability. The purpose of this paper is to motivate a general definition of
strength of connection, based on the notion of algebraic distances, discuss its
implementation, and present the results of initial numerical experiments. The
algebraic distance measure, we propose, uses as its main tool a least squares

simulated using relativistic Fokker-Planck dynamics for elastic scattering in a

are obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix interactions which build up
resonant correlations close to the transition temperature. The latter also form
the basis for hadronization of heavy quarks into heavy-flavor mesons via
recombination with light quarks from the medium. The pertinent resonance
recombination satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping
between quark and meson distributions. The recombination probability is derived
from the resonant heavy-quark scattering rate. Consequently, recombination
dominates at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and yields to fragmentation at
high $p_T$. Our approach thus emphasizes the role of resonance correlations in
the diffusion and hadronization processes. We calculate the nuclear
modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$- and $B$-mesons for Au-Au

environments, we prove the ergodicity of the annealed process w.r.t. the
dynamics ""from the point of view of the particle"". This implies in particular
that the environment viewed from the particle is ergodic. As an example of

from Fe d-orbitals near the conduction band minimum. The deposition of a few

these narrow bands leads to an exchange splitting between the spin sub-bands,
yielding a highly spin-polarized conducting state distinct from the rest of the

Our aim is to establish the fundamental basis for understanding the effect of
geometry on the nonlinear-optical response of quantum loops that are formed
into a network of quantum wires. Using the concept of leaky quantum wires, it
is shown that in the limit of full confinement, the sum rules are obeyed when
the transverse infinite-energy continuum states are included. While the
continuum states associated with the transverse wavefunction do not contribute
to the nonlinear optical response, they are essential to preserving the
validity of the sum rules. This work is a building block for future studies of
nonlinear-optical enhancement of quantum graphs (which include loops and bent
wires) based on their geometry. These properties are important in quantum
mechanical modeling of any response function of quantum-confined systems,
including the nonlinear-optical response of any system in which there is
confinement in at leat one dimension, such as nanowires, which provide

applications, the complexity of the decisions they face demands advances in

in an auction should try to maximize the seller's profit by reasoning about a
variety of possibly uncertain pieces of information, such as the maximum prices
various buyers might be willing to pay, the possible prices being offered by
competing sellers, the rules by which the auction operates, the dynamic arrival
and matching of offers to buy and sell, and so on. A naive application of
multiagent reasoning techniques would require the seller's agent to explicitly
model all of the other agents through an extended time horizon, rendering the
problem intractable for many realistically-sized problems. We have instead
devised a new strategy that an agent can use to determine its bid price based
on a more tractable Markov chain model of the auction process. We have
experimentally identified the conditions under which our new strategy works
well, as well as how well it works in comparison to the optimal performance the
agent could have achieved had it known the future. Our results show that our
new strategy in general performs well, outperforming other tractable heuristic
strategies in a majority of experiments, and is particularly effective in a
'seller?s market', where many buy offers are available.

iterations, AdaBoost achieves a value of the exponential loss that is at most
$\epsilon$ more than the best possible value, where $C$ depends on the dataset.
We show that this dependence of the rate on $\epsilon$ is optimal up to

faster (as $1/R^2$) after kinetic decoupling than that in kinetic equilibrium

kinetic decoupling will affect the DM relic density significantly. Focusing on
the model parameters that trying to explain the anomalous cosmic
positron/electron excesses observed by PAMELA/Fermi/ATIC we find the elastic
scattering $Xf\to Xf$ is not efficient to keep dark matter in kinetic
equilibrium, and the kinetic decoupling temperature $T_{kd}$ is comparable to
the chemical decoupling temperature $T_f\sim O(10) GeV$. The reduction of the
relic density after $T_{kd}$ is significant and leads to a limited enhancement
factor $\sim O(10^2)$. Therefore it is difficult to explain the anomalous

approach where an adaptive mesh is generated as a uniform one in the metric
specified by a given tensor M. A key component is the determination of an
appropriate metric which is often based on some type of Hessian recovery.
Recently, the use of a global hierarchical basis error estimator was proposed
for the development of an anisotropic metric tensor for the adaptive finite
element solution. This study discusses the use of this method for a selection
of different applications. Numerical results show that the method performs well
and is comparable with existing metric tensors based on Hessian recovery. Also,
it can provide even better adaptation to the solution if applied to problems
with gradient jumps and steep boundary layers. For the Poisson problem in a
domain with a corner singularity, the new method provides meshes that are fully
comparable to the theoretically optimal meshes.

networks using finite state agents. A black hole is a harmful node in the
network that destroys any agent visiting that node without leaving any trace.
The objective is to locate the black hole without destroying too many agents.
This is difficult to achieve when the agents are initially scattered in the
network and are unaware of the location of each other. Previous studies for
black hole search used more powerful models where the agents had non-constant
memory, were labelled with distinct identifiers and could either write messages
on the nodes of the network or mark the edges of the network. In contrast, we
solve the problem using a small team of finite-state agents each carrying a
constant number of identical tokens that could be placed on the nodes of the
network. Thus, all resources used in our algorithms are independent of the
network size. We restrict our attention to oriented torus networks and first
show that no finite team of finite state agents can solve the problem in such
networks, when the tokens are not movable. In case the agents are equipped with
movable tokens, we determine lower bounds on the number of agents and tokens
required for solving the problem in torus networks of arbitrary size. Further,
we present a deterministic solution to the black hole search problem for
oriented torus networks, using the minimum number of agents and tokens.

extensions of the Standard Model. Hierarchies of masses, flavour mixings and
control of couplings select higher order del Pezzo singularities, minimising
the Higgs sector prefers toric del Pezzos with dP3 providing the most
successful compromise. Then a supersymmetric local string model is presented
with the following properties at low energies: (i) the MSSM spectrum plus a
local B-L gauge field or additional Higgs fields depending on the breaking
pattern, (ii) a realistic hierarchy of quark and lepton masses and (iii)
realistic flavour mixing between quark and lepton families with computable CKM
and PMNS matrices, and CP violation consistent with observations. In this
construction, kinetic terms are diagonal and under calculational control
suppressing standard FCNC contributions. Proton decay operators of dimension 4,
5, 6 are suppressed, and gauge couplings can unify depending on the breaking
scales from string scales at energies in the range 10^{12}-10^{16} GeV,
consistent with TeV soft-masses from moduli mediated supersymmetry breaking.
The GUT scale model corresponds to D3 branes at dP3 with two copies of the
Pati-Salam gauge symmetry SU(4)\timesSU(2)R\timesSU(2)L. D-brane instantons
generate a non-vanishing mu-term. Right handed sneutrinos can break the B-L
symmetry and induce a see-saw mechanism of neutrino masses and R-parity

Kepler EC host stars with a control sample of dwarf stars selected from the
~150,000 stars observed during Q1 and Q2 of the Kepler mission but with no
detected planets. We find that at J-H = 0.30 characteristic of solar-type
stars, the average g-r color of stars that host giant ECs is 4-sigma redder
than the average color of the stars in the control sample. At the same time,
the average g-r color of solar-type stars that host small-radius ECs is
indistinguishable from the average color of the stars in the control sample. In
addition, we find that at J-H = 0.62 indicative of late K dwarfs, the average
g-r color of stars that host small-radius ECs is 4-sigma redder than the
average color of the stars in the control sample. These offsets are unlikely to
be caused by differential reddening, age differences between the two
populations, or the presence of giant stars in the control sample. Stellar
models suggest that the first color offset is due to a 0.2 dex enhancement in
[Fe/H] of the giant EC host population at M_star = 1 M_Sun, while Sloan
photometry of M 67 and NGC 6791 suggests that the second color offset is due to
a similar [Fe/H] enhancement of the small-radius EC host population at M_star =
0.7 M_Sun. These correlations are a natural consequence of the core-accretion

couplings to matter) in the case of low-scale supersymmetry breaking such as
gauge mediation. We argue that even if the mechanism of moduli stabilization is
decoupled from the mechanism of SUSY breaking, moduli masses will generically
be parametrically related to the gravitino mass once the cancellation of the
cosmological constant is taken into account. For low- scale SUSY breaking, this
implies that moduli fields are light, long-lived relics that will generically
drive the universe into a matter-dominated phase, in contradiction to standard
BBN. We discuss two scenarios for evading this problem. The first is to
consider very tuned supergravity potentials that can make the moduli heavy
enough to decay at early times and reheat above the temperature of BBN. Viable
cosmology can be achieved in this scenario, which has a population of highly
relativistic light gravitinos arising from decays of moduli. Next, we consider
the more natural scenario with light moduli. The saxion field associated with
the solution of the strong CP problem provides the most natural candidate for
driving thermal inflation, which dilutes the moduli. We construct an explicit
model for this scenario, when the PQ symmetry breaking scale is larger than the
messenger scale. The combination of the constraints on relic abundance and
gamma-ray flux from decay of the moduli favors a particular region of SUSY
breaking scale, 2 x 10^3 - 10^4 TeV. For either scenario, we find that it is
generic for low-scale SUSY to be associated with late entropy production and
accompanying low reheating temperatures.

measurements of weak lensing or investigations of galaxy evolution. The huge
variety of morphologies requires an approach that is highly flexible, e.g.,
accounting for azimuthal structure. We revisit the method of sersiclets, where
galaxy morphologies are decomposed into basis functions based on the Sersic
profile. This approach is justified by the fact that the Sersic profile is the
first-order Taylor expansion of any real light profile. We show that sersiclets
overcome the modelling failures of shapelets. However, sersiclets implicate an
unphysical relation between the steepness of the light profile and the spatial
scale of azimuthal structures, which is not obeyed by real galaxy morphologies
and can therefore give rise to modelling failures. Moreover, we demonstrate
that sersiclets are prone to undersampling, which restricts sersiclet modelling
to highly resolved galaxy images. Analysing data from the Great08 challenge, we
demonstrate that sersiclets should not be used in weak-lensing studies. We
conclude that although the sersiclet approach appears very promising at first
glance, it suffers from conceptual and practical problems that severly limit
its usefulness. The Sersic profile can be enhanced by higher-order terms in the
Taylor expansion, which can drastically improve model reconstructions of galaxy
images. If orthonormalised, these higher-order profiles can overcome the
problems of sersiclets while preserving their mathematical justification.

distinct kinematic energy scales. When measuring the dijet invariant mass m_jj
between two signal jets produced in association with other jets or weak bosons,
m_jj will typically be much smaller than the total partonic center-of-mass
energy Q, but larger than the individual jet masses m, such that there can be a
hierarchy of scales m << m_jj << Q. This situation arises in many new-physics
analyses at the LHC, where the invariant mass between jets is used to gain
access to the masses of new-physics particles in a decay chain. At present, the
logarithms arising from such a hierarchy of kinematic scales can only be summed
at the leading-logarithmic level provided by parton-shower programs. We
construct an effective field theory, SCET+, which is an extension of
soft-collinear effective theory that applies to this situation of hierarchical
jets. It allows for a rigorous separation of different scales in a multiscale
soft function and for a systematic resummation of logarithms of both m_jj/Q and
m/Q. As an explicit example, we consider the invariant mass spectrum of the two
closest jets in e+e- -> 3 jets. We also give the generalization to pp -> N jets

large scatter in the DM velocity anisotropy profiles of different halos (across
elliptical shells extending to at least ~$1.5 r_{vir}$), universal patterns are
found when these are averaged over halo mass, redshift, and relaxation stage.
These are characterized by a very small velocity anisotropy at the halo center,
increasing outward to about 0.27 and leveling off at about $0.2 r_{vir}$.
Indirect measurements of the DM velocity anisotropy fall on the upper end of

investigate the incidence of close galaxy pairs between z=0.4-2. Many such
close pairs will eventually merge, and the pair fraction is therefore related
to the merger rate. Over this redshift range the mean pair fraction is
essentially constant (evolving as f_pair (1+z)^{-0.4 +/- 0.6}) with about
6+/-1% of massive galaxies having a 1:4 or greater companion within 30h^-1 kpc.
Assuming the timescale over which pairs merge is not a strong function of
redshift, this implies a similarly constant merger rate (per unit time) out to
z=2. Since about three times as much cosmic time passes at z<1 as between
z=1-2, this implies that correspondingly more mergers occur in the low-redshift
universe. When minor companions (1:10 mass ratio or greater) are included, the
pair fraction increases to ~20% and still does not evolve strongly with
redshift. We also use a rest-frame color criterion to select pairs containing
only quiescent galaxies (major ""dry merger"" progenitors), and find them to be
similarly rare and constant with 4-7% of massive quiescent galaxies exhibiting
a nearby companion. Thus, even though other studies find major mergers to be
relatively uncommon since z=1, our results suggest that few additional mergers
occur in the 1<z<2 range and other mechanisms may be required to explain the
mass and size growth of galaxies over this epoch.

fact, it has been shown that almost all $C_5$-free (and hence, almost all

problems require analysis of some of their global characteristics. These are
primarily affected by the topology of the network. We present in this paper, a
general framework for a topological analysis of a network, and develop
distributed algorithms in a generalized combinatorial setting in order to solve
two seemingly unrelated problems, 1) Coverage hole detection and Localization
and 2) Worm hole attack detection and Localization. We also note these
solutions remain coordinate free as no priori localization information of the
nodes is assumed. For the coverage hole problem, we follow a ""divide and
conquer approach"", by strategically dissecting the network so that the overall
topology is preserved, while efficiently pursuing the detection and
localization of failures. The detection of holes, is enabled by first
attributing a combinatorial object called a ""Rips Complex"" to each network
segment, and by subsequently checking the existence/non-existence of holes by
way of triviality of the first homology class of this complex. Our estimate
exponentially approaches the location of potential holes with each iteration,
yielding a very fast convergence coupled with optimal usage of valuable
resources such as power and memory. We then show a simple extension of the
above problem to address a well known problem in networks, namely the
localization of a worm hole attack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
presented algorithm with several substantiating examples.

observable by interferometers that can resolve stellar disks. Here I discuss
predictions emerging from 3D MHD simulations for solar-type stars with the
anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code and how these predictions may be
observationally tested. The zonal flow of differential rotation is likely the
most easily observable signature of dynamics occurring deep within the stellar
interior. Generally, we find that rapidly rotating suns have a strong
solar-like differential rotation with a prograde equator and retrograde poles
while slowly spinning suns may have anti-solar rotation profiles with fast
poles and slow equators. The thermal wind balance accompanying the differential
rotation may lead to hot and bright poles in the rapid rotators and cooler,
darker poles in slow rotators. The convection and differential rotation build
global-scale magnetic structures in the bulk of the convection zone, and these
wreaths of magnetism may be observable near the stellar surfaces.

characteristic of globular clusters (GCs), not all of them present multiple

otherwise intriguing observational framework. Our scenario divides GCs into
three groups, depending on the initial mass (M_I) of the progenitor structure
(PS), as follows. i) Massive PSs can retain the gas ejected by massive stars,
including the ejecta of core-collapse SNe. ii) Intermediate-mass PSs can retain
at least a fraction of the fast winds of massive stars, but none of the
core-collapse SNe ejecta. iii) Low-mass PSs can only retain the slow winds of
intermediate-mass stars. Members of the first group would include omega
Centauri (NGC 5139), M54 (NGC 6715), M22 (NGC 6656), and Terzan 5, whereas NGC
2808 (and possibly NGC 2419) would be members of the second group. The
remaining GCs which only present a spread in light elements, such as O and Na,
would be members of the third group. According to our scenario, the different
components in omega Cen should not display a sizeable spread in age. We argue
that this is consistent with the available observations. We give other simple
arguments in favor of our scenario, which can be described in terms of two main
analytical relations: i) Between the actual observed ratio between first and
second generation stars (R_SG^FG) and the fraction of first generation stars
that have been lost by the GC (S_L); and ii) Between S_L and M_I. We also
suggest a series of future improvements and empirical tests that may help
decide whether the proposed scenario properly describes the chemical evolution
of GCs.

were fabricated. Viscosity curves and normal stresses were measured using a
rheometer for a wide range of packing fractions for each shape. Suspensions of
each shape exhibit qualitatively similar Discontinuous Shear Thickening. The
logarithmic slope of the stress/shear-rate relation increases dramatically with
packing fraction and diverges at a critical packing fraction phi_c which
depends on particle shape. The packing fraction dependence of the viscosity
curves for different convex shapes can be collapsed when the packing fraction
is normalized by phi_c. Intriguingly, viscosity curves for non-convex particles
do not collapse on the same set as convex particles, showing strong shear
thickening over a wider range of packing fraction. The value of phi_c is found
to coincide with the onset of a yield stress at the jamming transition,
suggesting the jamming transition also controls shear thickening. The yield
stress is found to correspond with trapped air in the suspensions, and the
scale of the stress can be attributed to interfacial tension forces which
dramatically increase above phi_c due to the geometric constraints of jamming.
The relationship between shear and normal stresses is found to be linear in
both the shear thickening and jammed regimes, indicating that the shear
stresses come from friction. In the limit of zero shear rate, normal stresses
pull the rheometer plates together due to the surface tension of the liquid
below phi_c, but push the rheometer plates apart due to jamming above phi_c.

heterogeneity is conventionally modeled as variable-density water converted
from CT images to best reproduce the stopping power, which may lead to
inaccuracies in the handling of multiple scattering and nuclear interactions.
Although similar conversions can be defined for these individual interactions,
they would be valid only for specific CT systems and would require additional
tasks for clinical application. This study aims to improve the practicality of
the interaction-specific heterogeneity correction. Methods: We calculated the
electron densities and effective densities for stopping power, multiple
scattering, and nuclear interactions of protons and ions, using the standard
elemental-composition data for body tissues to construct the invariant
conversion functions. We also simulated a proton beam in a lung-like geometry
and a carbon-ion beam in a prostate-like geometry to demonstrate the procedure
and the effects of the interaction-specific heterogeneity correction. Results:
Strong correlations were observed between the electron density and the
respective effective densities, with which we formulated polyline conversion
functions. Their effects amounted to 10% differences in multiple-scattering
angle and nuclear-interaction mean free path for bones compared to those in the
conventional heterogeneity correction. Although their realistic effect on
patient dose distributions would be generally small, it could be at the level
of a few percent when a beam traverses a large bone. Conclusions: The present
conversion functions are invariant and may be incorporated in treatment
planning systems with a common function relating CT number to electron density.
This will enable improved beam dose calculation while minimizing initial setup
and quality management of the user's specific system.

suggests that harmonic oscillator potentials for constituent quarks in lightest
mesons and baryons may result from the gluon condensation inside hadrons,
rather than from an omnipresent gluon condensate in vacuum. The resulting
boost-invariant constituent dynamics at the renormalization group momentum
scales comparable with Lambda_QCD, is identified using gauge symmetry and a
crude mean-field approximation for gluons. Besides constituent quark models,
the resulting picture also resembles models based on AdS/QCD ideas. However,
our hypothetical picture significantly differs from the models by the available
option for a systematic analysis in QCD, in which the new picture may be
treated as a candidate for a first approximation. This option is outlined by
embedding our presentation of the crude and simple hadron picture in the
context of RGPEP and a brief outlook on hadron phenomenology. Several
appendices describe elements of the formalism required for actual calculations
in QCD, including an extension of RGPEP beyond perturbation theory.

literature for measuring risk in a multi-period setting. The first corresponds
to applying a single coherent risk measure to the cumulative future costs,
while the second involves applying a composition of one-step coherent risk
mappings. We summarize the relative strengths of the two methods, characterize
several necessary and sufficient conditions under which one of the measurements
always dominates the other, and introduce a metric to quantify how close the
two risk measures are.
  Using this notion, we address the question of how tightly a given coherent
measure can be approximated by lower or upper-bounding compositional measures.
We exhibit an interesting asymmetry between the two cases: the tightest
possible upper-bound can be exactly characterized, and corresponds to a popular
construction in the literature, while the tightest-possible lower bound is not
readily available. We show that testing domination and computing the
approximation factors is generally NP-hard, even when the risk measures in
question are comonotonic and law-invariant. However, we characterize conditions
and discuss several examples where polynomial-time algorithms are possible. One
such case is the well-known Conditional Value-at-Risk measure, which is further
explored in our companion paper [Huang, Iancu, Petrik and Subramanian, ""Static

constructions exploit interesting connections between the study of risk

developed for constructing sequential arm selection policies. It is shown that
for all light-tailed reward distributions, DSEE achieves the optimal
logarithmic order of the regret, where regret is defined as the total expected

for p>2. With the knowledge of an upperbound on a finite moment of the
heavy-tailed reward distributions, DSEE offers the optimal logarithmic regret
order. The proposed DSEE approach complements existing work on MAB by providing
corresponding results for general reward distributions. Furthermore, with a
clearly defined tunable parameter-the cardinality of the exploration sequence,
the DSEE approach is easily extendable to variations of MAB, including MAB with
various objectives, decentralized MAB with multiple players and incomplete

combinatorial MAB with dependent arms that often arise in network optimization

the other hand, real repeated interaction generally allows plasticity (i.e.,
learning) of individuals based on the experience of the past. Although
plasticity is relevant to various biological phenomena, its role in repeated
social dilemma games is relatively unexplored. In particular, if
experience-based learning plays a key role in promotion and maintenance of
cooperation, learners should evolve in the contest with nonlearners under
selection pressure. By modeling players using a simple reinforcement learning
model, we numerically show that learning enables the evolution of cooperation.
We also show that numerically estimated adaptive dynamics appositely predict

particle presence: both particles inside the trap (in-in), one particle in and
one particle out (in-out), and both particles outside (out-out). It is shown
that the in-in probability is dominated by exponential decay, and its decay

  Up to a certain range of interaction strength the decay of in-out probability

ranges 0.82^{+0.05}_{-0.06} solar masses and (6.9+/-0.4)x10^8 cm, respectively,
with the aid of a WD mass-radius relation. The solid angle of the reflector
viewed from the post-shock plasma was measured to be Omega/2pi = 0.91+/-0.26. A
fluorescent iron Kalpha emission line is detected, whose central energy is
discovered to be modulated with the WD rotation for the first time in
magnetic-CVs. Detailed spectral analysis indicates that the line comprises of a
stable 6.4 keV component and a red-shifted component, the latter of which
appears only around the rotational intensity-minimum phase. The equivalent
width (EW) of the former stable component ~80 eV together with the measured
Omega indicates the major reflector is the WD surface, and the shock height is
not more than 7% of the WD radius. Comparing this limitation to the height
predicted by the Aizu model (1973), we estimated the fractional area onto which
the accretion occurs to be < 7x10^{-3}$ of the WD radius, which is the most
severe constraint in non-eclipsing IPs. The red-shifted iron line component, on
the other hand, can be interpreted as emanating from the pre-shock accretion
flow via fluorescence. Its EW (28^{+44}_{-13} eV) and the central energy
(6.30_{-0.05}^{+0.07} keV) at the intensity-minimum phase are consistent with
this interpretation.

strongly affected by dipolar polarization of the liquid at the interface. We
show, by numerical simulations, that the electric ""cavity"" field inside a
hydrated non-polar solute does not follow the predictions of standard Maxwell's
electrostatics of dielectrics. Instead, the field inside the solute tends, with
increasing solute size, to the limit predicted by the Lorentz virtual cavity.
The standard paradigm fails because of its reliance on the surface charge
density at the dielectric interface determined by the boundary conditions of
the Maxwell dielectric. The interface of a polar liquid instead carries a
preferential in-plane orientation of the surface dipoles thus producing
virtually no surface charge. The resulting boundary conditions for
electrostatic problems differ from the traditional recipes, affecting the
microscopic and macroscopic fields based on them. We show that relatively small
differences in cavity fields propagate into significant differences in the
dielectric constant of an ideal mixture. The slope of the dielectric increment
of the mixture versus the solute concentration depends strongly on which
polarization scenario at the interface is realized. A much steeper slope found
in the case of Lorentz polarization also implies a higher free energy penalty
for polarizing such mixtures.

interactions depend on the source. For the theta term, the leading potential is
solely given by one-pion exchange, which does not contribute to the deuteron
electric dipole moment. In subleading order, a new two-pion-exchange potential
is obtained. Its short-range component is indistinguishable from one of two
undetermined contact interactions that appear at the same order and represent
effects of heavier mesons and other short-range QCD dynamics. One-pion-exchange

candidate non-Blazhko (or unmodulated) stars. In this paper we present the
results of Fourier decomposition of the time-series photometry of these stars
acquired during the first 417 days of operation (Q0-Q5) of the Kepler
telescope. Fourier parameters based on ~18400 long-cadence observations per
star (and ~150000 short-cadence observations for FN Lyr and for AW Dra) are
derived. None of the stars shows the recently discovered `period-doubling'
effect seen in Blazhko variables; however, KIC 7021124 has been found to
pulsate simultaneously in the fundamental and second overtone modes with a
period ratio P2/P0 ~ 0.59305 and is similar to the double-mode star V350 Lyr.
Period change rates are derived from O-C diagrams spanning, in some cases, over
100 years; these are compared with high-precision periods derived from the
Kepler data alone. Extant Fourier correlations by Kovacs, Jurcsik et al. (with
minor transformations from the V to the Kp passband) have been used to derive
underlying physical characteristics for all the stars. This procedure seems to
be validated through comparisons of the Kepler variables with galactic and LMC
RR Lyr stars. The most metal-poor star in the sample is NR Lyr, with
[Fe/H]=-2.3 dex; and the four most metal-rich stars have [Fe/H] ranging from
-0.6 to +0.1 dex. Pulsational luminosities and masses are found to be
systematically smaller than L and mass values derived from stellar evolution
models, and are favoured over the evolutionary values when periods are computed
with the Warsaw linear hydrodynamics code. Finally, the Fourier parameters are
compared with theoretical values derived using the Warsaw non-linear convective
pulsation code.

separated by a large energy gap, of the order of the zero-temperature
superconducting gap $\Delta$, from a band of single-particle non-topological

they could be due to Comptonization delays in the case when high energy photons
impinge back on the soft photon source. Both models can be verified and their

a 3M_sun central black hole surrounded by a neutrino emitting accretion torus
with 90km radius, which serves as basis for computing spherically symmetric
neutrino-driven wind solutions. We find that ejecta with modest entropies (~30
per nucleon in units of the Boltzmann constant) and moderate expansion
timescales (~100ms) dominate in the mass outflow. The mass-integrated
nucleosynthetic abundances are in good agreement with the solar system
r-process abundance distribution if a minimal value of the electron fraction at
the charged-particle freezeout, Ye,min~0.2, is achieved. In the case of
Ye,min~0.3, the production of r-elements beyond A~130 does not reach to the
third peak but could be still important for an explanation of the abundance
signatures in r-process deficient stars in the early Galaxy. The total mass of
the ejected r-process nuclei is estimated to be ~1x10^-3 M_sun. If our model
was representative, this demands a Galactic event rate of ~2x10^-4 yr^-1 for
black-hole-torus winds from merger remnants to be the dominant source of the
r-process elements. Our result thus suggests that black-hole-torus winds from
compact binary mergers have the potential to be a major but probably not the

perturbation theory on $\beta=f(\Omega)/b$, where $b$ is the bias factor of the
galaxy distribution. The recovered line-of-sight peculiar velocities are
subtracted from the redshifts to derive the distances, which thus allows an
estimate of the absolute magnitude of each galaxy. A constraint on $\beta$ is
then found by minimizing the spread of the estimated magnitudes from their

consistent with our previous estimate from the velocity-velocity comparison.
The method could easily be applied to subvolumes extracted from the SDSS survey

applicable to ongoing and future spectroscopic redshift surveys to trace the
evolution of $f(\Omega)$ to $z\sim1$. Constraints obtained from this method are
entirely independent from those obtained from the two-dimensional distortion of

We illustrated earlier that in classical Hamilton mechanics, for overwhelming
majority of real chaotic macroscopic systems, alignment of their thermodynamic
time arrows occurs because of their low interaction. This fact and
impossibility to observe entropy decrease at introspection explain the second
law of thermodynamics. The situation in quantum mechanics is even a little bit
easier: all closed systems of finite volume are periodic or nearly periodic.
The proof in quantum mechanics is in many respects similar to the proof in
classical Hamilton mechanics - it also uses small interaction between
subsystems and impossibility to observe entropy decrease at introspection.
However, there are special cases which were not found in the classical
mechanics. In these cases one microstate corresponds to a set of possible
macrostates (more precisely, their quantum superposition). Consideration of
this property with use of decoherence theory and taking into account
thermodynamic time arrows will introduce new outcomes in quantum mechanics. It
allows to resolve basic paradoxes of quantum mechanics: (a) to explain the
paradox of wave packet reduction at measurements when an observer is included
in the system (introspection) (paradox of the Schrodinger cat); (b) to explain
unobservability of superposition of macroscopic states by an external observer
in real experiments (paradox of Wigner's friend); (c) to prove full equivalence
of multi-world and Copenhagen interpretations of quantum mechanics; (d) to
explain deviations from the exponential law at decay of particles and pass from
one energy level to another (paradox of a kettle which will never begin to
boil).

  colour of thermal noise",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observation of the Brownian motion of a small probe interacting with its
environment is one of the main strategies to characterize soft matter.
Essentially two counteracting forces govern the motion of the Brownian
particle. First, the particle is driven by the rapid collisions with the
surrounding solvent molecules, referred to as thermal noise. Second, the
friction between the particle and the viscous solvent damps its motion.
Conventionally, the thermal force is assumed to be random and characterized by
a white noise spectrum. Friction is assumed to be given by the Stokes drag,
implying that motion is overdamped. However, as the particle receives momentum
from the fluctuating fluid molecules, it also displaces the fluid in its
immediate vicinity. The entrained fluid acts back on the sphere and gives rise
to long-range correlation. This hydrodynamic memory translates to thermal
forces, which display a coloured noise spectrum. Even 100 years after Perrin's
pioneering experiments on Brownian motion, direct experimental observation of
this colour has remained elusive. Here, we measure the spectrum of thermal
noise by confining the Brownian fluctuations of a microsphere by a strong
optical trap. We show that due to hydrodynamic correlations the power spectral
density of the spheres positional fluctuations exhibits a resonant peak in
strong contrast to overdamped systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that peak
amplification can be achieved through parametric excitation. In analogy to
Microcantilever-based sensors our results demonstrate that the
particle-fluid-trap system can be considered as a nanomechanical resonator,
where the intrinsic hydrodynamic backflow enhances resonance. Therefore,
instead of being a disturbance, details in thermal noise can be exploited for
the development of new types of sensors and particle-based assays for
lab-on-a-chip applications.

LZCep in order to constrain the effects of binarity on the evolution of massive
stars. Methods. We use a set of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio
optical spectra obtained over the orbital period of the system to perform a
spectroscopic disentangling and derive an orbital solution. We subsequently
determine the stellar properties of each component through an analysis with the
CMFGEN atmosphere code. Finally, with the derived stellar parameters, we model
the Hipparcos photometric light curve using the program NIGHTFALL to obtain the
inclination and the real stellar masses. Results. LZCep is a O9III+ON9.7V
binary. It is as a semi-detached system in which either the primary or the
secondary star almost fills up its Roche lobe. The dynamical masses are about
16.0 $M_{\odot}$ (primary) and 6.5 M_{\odot}$ (secondary). The latter is lower
than the typical mass of late-type O stars. The secondary component is
chemically more evolved than the primary (which barely shows any sign of CNO
processing), with strong helium and nitrogen enhancements as well as carbon and
oxygen depletions. These properties (surface abundances and mass) are typical
of Wolf-Rayet stars, although the spectral type is ON9.7V. The luminosity of
the secondary is consistent with that of core He-burning objects. The
preferred, tentative evolutionary scenario to explain the observed properties
involves mass transfer from the secondary - which was initially more massive -
towards the primary. The secondary is now almost a core He-burning object,
probably with only a thin envelope of H-rich and CNO processed material. A very
inefficient mass transfer is necessary to explain the chemical appearance of
the primary. Alternative scenarios are discussed but they suffer from more
uncertainties.

The model is
ill-defined, and in order to reguralize it, Elbau and Felder introduced a model
with a cut-off and corresponding system of orthogonal polynomials with respect
to a varying exponential weight on the cut-off region on the complex plane. In
the present paper we show how to define orthogonal polynomials on a specially
chosen system of infinite contours on the complex plane, without any cut-off,
which satisfy the same recurrence algebraic identity that is asymptotically
valid for the orthogonal polynomials of Elbau and Felder. The main goal of this
paper is to develop the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to the orthogonal
polynomials under consideration and to obtain their asymptotic behavior on the
complex plane as the degree $n$ of the polynomial goes to infinity. As the
first step in the RH approach, we introduce an auxiliary vector equilibrium
problem for a pair of measures $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ on the complex plane. We then
formulate a $3\times 3$ matrix valued RH problem for the orthogonal polynomials
in hand, and we apply the nonlinear steepest descent method of Deift-Zhou to
the asymptotic analysis of the RH problem. The central steps in our study are a
sequence of transformations of the RH problem, based on the equilibrium vector
measure $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$, and the construction of a global parametrix. The main
result of this paper is a derivation of the large $n$ asymptotics of the
orthogonal polynomials on the whole complex plane. We prove that the
distribution of zeros of the orthogonal polynomials converges to the measure
$\mu_1$, the first component of the equilibrium measure. We also obtain
analytical results for the measure $\mu_1$ relating it to the distribution of

wireless networks is of both theoretical and practical importance. In this
paper, we formulate an analytical framework for resource allocation in a
downlink OFDMA-based broadband network with coexistence of secure users (SU)
and normal users (NU). The SU's require secure data transmission at the
physical layer while the NU's are served with conventional best-effort data
traffic. The problem is formulated as joint power and subcarrier allocation
with the objective of maximizing average aggregate information rate of all NU's
while maintaining an average secrecy rate for each individual SU under a total
transmit power constraint for the base station. We solve this problem in an
asymptotically optimal manner using dual decomposition. Our analysis shows that
an SU becomes a candidate competing for a subcarrier only if its channel gain
on this subcarrier is the largest among all and exceeds the second largest by a
certain threshold. Furthermore, while the power allocation for NU's follows the
conventional water-filling principle, the power allocation for SU's depends on
both its own channel gain and the largest channel gain among others. We also
develop a suboptimal algorithm to reduce the computational cost. Numerical
studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in
terms of the achievable pair of information rate for NU and secrecy rate for SU
at different power consumptions.

two-stage closest-neighbor clustering with PCD (TS-CNC-PCD), with the aim of

spectrum evidences the structure of the avoided level crossings as a function

phase diagram of the transfer efficiency across ground-state and inverse sweeps

single-particle Landau-Zener scheme is found for ground-state sweeps, in which
a breakdown of the adiabatic region emerges as the sweep rate decreases. On the
contrary, the transfer efficiency across inverse sweeps reveals consistent
results with the single-particle Landau-Zener predictions. In the strong

of the sweep rate. Our results are in qualitative agreement with those of the

problem of how the spreading of diseases depends on structural patterns. Here,
we contribute to further advance our understanding of epidemic spreading
processes by proposing a non-perturbative formulation of the heterogeneous mean
field approach that has been commonly used in the physics literature to deal
with this kind of spreading phenomena. The non-perturbative equations we
propose have no assumption about the proximity of the system to the epidemic
threshold, nor any linear approximation of the dynamics. In particular, we
first develop a probabilistic description at the node level of the epidemic
propagation for the so-called susceptible-infected-susceptible family of
models, and after we derive the corresponding heterogeneous mean-field
approach. We propose to use the full extension of the approach instead of
pruning the expansion to first order, which leads to a non-perturbative
formulation that can be solved by fixed point iteration, and used with
reliability far away from the epidemic threshold to assess the prevalence of
the epidemics. Our results are in close agreement with Monte Carlo simulations
thus enhancing the predictive power of the classical heterogeneous mean field
approach, while providing a more effective framework in terms of computational
time.

understanding the entities in the human algorithm. However, the problem with
this approach is that the algorithm does not consider the interaction of the
third party or unknown entities, which may be interacting with each other.
These unknown entities in their interaction with the non-computer entities make
an effect in the environment that influences the information and the behaviour
of the computer brain. Such details and the ability to process the dynamic and
unsettling nature of these interactions are absent in the current learning
algorithm such as the decision tree learning algorithm. IBSEAD is able to
evaluate and consider such algorithms and thus give us a better accuracy in
simulation of the highly evolved nature of the human brain. Processes such as
dreams, imagination and novelty, that exist in humans are not fully simulated
by the existing learning algorithms. Also, Hidden Markov models (HMM) are
useful in finding ""hidden"" entities, which may be known or unknown. However,
this model fails to consider the case of unknown entities which maybe unclear

non-diagonal tiles problem for this type of generalized matrix rings.
  We introduce two classes of isomorphisms from $T$ to $T'$, the disjoint union
of which is denoted by ${Iso}_0(T,T')$. We describe ${Iso}_0(T,T')$ by using
the $\Z$-graded ring structure of $T$ and $T'$. Our main result characterizes
${Iso}_0(T,T')$ as the set consisting of all semigraded isomorphisms and all
anti-semigraded isomorphisms from $T$ to $T'$, provided that the rings $R'$ and
$S'$ are indecomposable and at least one of $M'$ and $N'$ is nonzero; in
particular ${Iso}_0(T,T')$ contains all graded isomorphisms and all anti-graded
isomorphisms from $T$ to $T'$. We also present a situation where
${Iso}_0(T,T')={Iso}(T,T')$. This is in the case where $R,S,R'$ and $S'$ are
rings having only trivial idempotents and all the Morita maps are zero. In
particular, this shows that the group of automorphisms of $T$ is completely
determined.

research interest over the past few years. Previous review articles in CS limit
their scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using
matrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In
recent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This,
in turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random
matrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing
architectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition
hardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much
richer class of signals and to encode broader data models, including
continuous-time signals. In our overview, the theme is exploiting signal and
measurement structure in compressive sensing. The prime focus is bridging
theory and practice; that is, to pinpoint the potential of structured CS
strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. Our summary highlights new
directions as well as relations to more traditional CS, with the hope of
serving both as a review to practitioners wanting to join this emerging field,
and as a reference for researchers that attempts to put some of the existing
ideas in perspective of practical applications.

IceCube can also detect large numbers of MeV neutrinos by observing a
collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the dark noise. With 2
ms timing resolution, IceCube can track subtle features in the temporal
development of the supernova neutrino burst. For a supernova at the galactic

(SDSS) to have estimated black hole (BH) masses below 2\times10^6 M\odot.
Combining our results with previous ESI observations of similar objects, we
obtain an expanded sample of 93 galaxies and examine the relation between BH
mass and velocity dispersion (the M-Sigma relation) for active galaxies with
low BH masses. The low-mass active galaxies tend to follow the extrapolation of
the M-Sigma relation of inactive galaxies. Including results for active
galaxies of higher BH mass from the literature, we find a zero point{\alpha}=
7.68\pm0.08 and slope of {\beta}= 3.32\pm0.22 for the M-Sigma relation [in the
form log Mbh={\alpha}+{\beta}log({\sigma}*/200 km s-1)], with intrinsic scatter
of 0.46\pm0.03 dex. This result is consistent, within the uncertainties, with
the slope of the M-Sigma relation for reverberation-mapped active galaxies with
BH masses from 10^6 to 10^9 M\odot. For the subset of our sample having
morphological information from Hubble Space Telescope images, we examine the
slope of the M-Sigma relation separately for subsamples of barred and unbarred
host galaxies, and find no significant evidence for a difference in slope. We
do find a mild offset between low-inclination and high-inclination disk
galaxies, such that more highly inclined galaxies tend to have larger {\sigma}*
at a given value of BH mass, presumably due to the contribution of disk
rotation within the spectroscopic aperture. We also find that the velocity
dispersion of the ionized gas trace the stellar velocity dispersion well for
this large sample of low-mass Seyfert 1 galaxies.

structure gets distorted ahead of the crack in the secondary creep regime. The
damage profile characterizing the spatial distribution of lattice distortions
is well described by an exponential form. The characteristic length of the
exponential form provides the scale of damage which is found to be an
increasing function of the temperature: At low temperature damage is strongly
localized to the crack tip, while at high temperature damage extends to a
broader range leading to more efficient relaxation of overloads. As a
consequence, the stress intensity factor decreases with increasing temperature.
The final macroscopic failure of the system occurs suddenly which is initiated
by the creation of vacancies and voids. The creep strength exhibits the inverse
square root scaling with the notch size corrected by the extension of the

during our previous study for the years 1994-2002. In contrast to the previous
observations, we detect no clear drift of the active regions with respect to
the rotation of the star.
  Conclusions. Having shown a systematic longitudinal drift of the
spot-generating mechanism during 1994-2002, the star has clearly switched to a
low-activity state for 2004-2010, during which the spot locations appear more
random over phase space. It could be that the star is near to a minimum of its
activity cycle.

In this sense, stars in open clusters are the ideal targets. All stars in one

account existing experimental constraints. We consider the cases of elastic and
inelastic scattering with either spin-dependent or spin-independent coupling to
nucleons. We allow for isospin violating interactions as well as for light

modulation signal and the time-integrated event excess in CoGeNT, making it
difficult to explain both simultaneously. Moreover, within the wide range of DM
interaction models considered, we do not find a simultaneous explanation of
CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA compatible with constraints from other experiments.
However, in certain cases part of the data can be made consistent. For example,
the modulation signal from CoGeNT becomes consistent with the total rate and
with limits from other DM searches at 90% CL (but not with the DAMA/LIBRA
signal) if DM scattering is inelastic spin-independent with just the right
couplings to protons and neutrons to reduce the scattering rate on xenon.
Conversely the DAMA/LIBRA signal (but not CoGeNT) can be explained by
spin-dependent inelastic DM scattering.

stress, i.e. the stress at which the macroscopic inelastic deformation starts,
depends on distribution of local, attributed to each atomic site, critical
stresses at which the local inelastic deformation occurs. We describe exactly

homogeneous distribution of local critical stresses. The macroscopic stress
threshold of the athermal sliding is found. Kinetics of thermally-activated
creep of the sliding layer is described. The rate of the thermally activated
sliding is tightly connected with parameters of the low temperature strength.
The sliding activation volume scales with the applied external stress as ~

four-dimensional, non-perturbative N=1 compactifications of string theory. Our
study focuses on brane dynamics and their effective physics as encoded in the
holomorphic couplings of the low-energy N=1 effective action, most prominently
the superpotential W. This article is divided into three parts. In part one we
derive the effective action of a spacetime-filling D5-brane in generic Type IIB
Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications. In the second part we invoke tools
from string dualities, namely from F-theory, heterotic/F-theory duality and
mirror symmetry, for a more elaborate study of the dynamics of (p,q) 7-branes
and heterotic five-branes. In this context we perform exact computations of the
complete perturbative effective superpotential, both due to branes and
background fluxes. Finally, in the third part we present a novel geometric
description of five-branes in Type IIB and heterotic M-theory Calabi-Yau
compactifications via a non-Calabi-Yau threefold, that is canonically
constructed from the original five-brane and Calabi-Yau threefold via a
blow-up. We use this blow-up threefold to derive open-closed Picard-Fuchs
differential equations, that govern the complete effective brane and flux
superpotential. In addition, we present first evidence to interpret the blow-up
threefold as a flux compactification geometrically dual to the original
five-brane by defining an SU(3)-structure on it, that is generated dynamically
by the five-brane backreaction.

and tunneling of Majorana fermions between vortices removes the energy
degeneracy. In particular the spectrum of Majorana fermions in a triangular
lattice is gapped, and the Hamiltonian which describes such a system is
antisymmetric under time-reversal. We consider Majorana fermions on a
disordered triangular lattice. We find that even for very weak disorder in the

becomes strong, a percolation phase transition takes place, and the gap is
fully closed by extended states. The mechanism that underlies these phenomena

absence of the internetwork coupling ($J = 0$), the former network is well
known not to exhibit the synchronized phase at any finite coupling strength,
whereas the latter displays the mean-field transition. Through an analytic
approach based on the mean-field approximation, it is found that for the weakly
coupled 1D network ($J_{\rm I} \ll 1$) the increase of $J$ suppresses
synchrony, because the nonsynchronized 1D network becomes a heavier burden for
the synchronization process of the WS network. As the coupling in the 1D
network becomes stronger, it is revealed by the renormalization group (RG)
argument that the synchronization is enhanced as $J_{\rm I}$ is increased,
implying that the more enhanced partial synchronization in the 1D network makes
the burden lighter. Extensive numerical simulations confirm these expected
behaviors, while exhibiting a reentrant behavior in the intermediate range of
$J_{\rm I}$. The nonmonotonic change of the critical value of $J_{\rm II}$ is
also compared with the result from the numerical RG calculation.

few years for the analysis of complex models arising in population genetic,
epidemiology and system biology. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have
become work horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation
kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a set of
distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards
the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels,
which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and
the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many
complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the
best performance. In cases where it is possible to estimate the Fisher
information we can construct particularly efficient perturbation kernels. We
find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily
regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the
computational efficiency gains in a range of toy-examples which illustrate some
of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to
two demanding parameter inference problem in molecular biology, which highlight
the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal
models. We conclude with a general discussion of rational choice of

Differential Equations (ODEs) contain unknown parameters like the reaction rate
constants and the initial concentrations of the compounds. The large number of
parameters as well as their nonlinear impact on the model responses hamper the
determination of confidence regions for parameter estimates. At the same time,
classical approaches translating the uncertainty of the parameters into
confidence intervals for model predictions are hardly feasible.
  In this article it is shown that a so-called prediction profile likelihood
yields reliable confidence intervals for model predictions, despite arbitrarily
complex and high-dimensional shapes of the confidence regions for the estimated
parameters. Prediction confidence intervals of the dynamic states allow a
data-based observability analysis. The approach renders the issue of sampling a
high-dimensional parameter space into evaluating one-dimensional prediction
spaces. The method is also applicable if there are non-identifiable parameters
yielding to some insufficiently specified model predictions that can be
interpreted as non-observability. Moreover, a validation profile likelihood is
introduced that should be applied when noisy validation experiments are to be
interpreted.
  The properties and applicability of the prediction and validation profile
likelihood approaches are demonstrated by two examples, a small and instructive
ODE model describing two consecutive reactions, and a realistic ODE model for
the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. The presented general approach
constitutes a concept for observability analysis and for generating reliable
confidence intervals of model predictions, not only, but especially suitable
for mathematical models of biological systems.

function and transmission coefficient are equivalent; and (ii) proof of the
equivalence of the transmission coefficient and Fredholm determinant, in
particular in the case of distinct far fields.
