One fundamental open problem is to determine how and where these algorithms are
useful in a cognitive radio network. In radar and sensing signal processing,
the control of degrees of freedom (DOF)---or dimensionality---is the first
step, called pre-processing. In this paper, the combination of dimensionality
reduction with SVM is proposed apart from only applying SVM for classification
in cognitive radio. Measured Wi-Fi signals with high signal to noise ratio
(SNR) are employed to the experiments. The DOF of Wi-Fi signals is extracted by
dimensionality reduction techniques. Experimental results show that with
dimensionality reduction, the performance of classification is much better with
fewer features than that of without dimensionality reduction. The error rates
of classification with only one feature of the proposed algorithm can match the
error rates of 13 features of the original data. The proposed method will be
further tested in our cognitive radio network testbed.

The mathematical model takes into account the effect of the deformation on the

framework for solving the proposed mathematical model, which consists of
coupled non-linear partial differential equations. It should be noted that many
popular numerical formulations may produce unphysical negative values for the
concentration, particularly, when the diffusion process is anisotropic. The
violation of the non-negative constraint by these numerical formulations is not
mere numerical noise. In the proposed computational framework we employ a novel
numerical formulation that will ensure that the concentration of the diffusant
be always non-negative, which is one of the main contributions of this paper.
Representative numerical examples are presented to show the robustness,
convergence, and performance of the proposed computational framework. Another
contribution of this paper is to systematically study the affect of transport
of the diffusant on the deformation of the solid and vice-versa, and their
implication in modeling degradation/healing of materials. We show that the
coupled response is both qualitatively and quantitatively different from the

users in Multi-cell MIMO cooperative networks is considered. We approach the
problem from both the sum-rate and fairness perspectives. First, we show that
there are many allocations that can provide near maximum sumrate while varying
significantly in fairness, which is assessed through the mean versus variance
criteria. Second, Two novel schemes that achieve near maximum sum-rate while
offering fair allocation of the backhaul bandwidth among users are proposed:
the Equal Signal-to-Interference ratio (SIR) and the Equal Interference
schemes. Simulation results show that, for the same mean rate among users, the
proposed schemes can achieve more fairness when compared to the conventional
scheme, which gives all users the same share of bandwidth. Moreover, we show
that the Equal SIR scheme can achieve zero variance among users in a wide range
of backhaul bandwidths while keeping very close to maximum sum rate. This is
the most fair solution that can be used in Multi-cell MIMO in that range of
backhaul bandwidths.

low-mass protostars that correspond to rapid mass-accretion events in the
innermost region of a protostellar disc. The outbursts are accompanied by
strong outflows, with the inferred mass outflow rates reaching ~10% of the mass
inflow rates. Shu et al. proposed that the outflows represent accreted disc
material that is driven centrifugally from the spun-up surface layers of the
protostar by the stellar magnetic field. This model was critiqued by Calvet et
al., who argued that it cannot reproduce the photospheric absorption-line
shifts observed in the prototype object FU Ori. Calvet et al. proposed that the
wind is launched, instead, from the surface of the disc on scales of a few
stellar radii by a non-stellar magnetic field. In this paper we present results
from numerical simulations of disc accretion on to a slowly rotating star with
an aligned magnetic dipole moment that gives rise to a kilogauss-strength
surface field. We demonstrate that, for parameters appropriate to FU Ori, such
a system can develop a strong, collimated disc outflow of the type previously
identified by Romanova et al. in simulations of protostars with low and
moderate accretion rates. At the high accretion rate that characterizes FUOR
outbursts, the radius at which the disc is truncated by the stellar magnetic
field moves much closer to the stellar surface, but the basic properties of the
outflow, which is launched from the vicinity of the truncation radius along
opened-up stellar magnetic field lines, remain the same, and are distinct from
those of the mechanism proposed by Shu et al. We show that the simulated
outflow can in principle account for the main observed characteristics of FUOR
winds, including the photospheric line shifts measured in FU Ori.

those of the Tonks gas, but at high densities, the orientational degrees of
freedom become effectively frozen due to jamming. This is a simple analytically
tractable model of glassy phase. Under a cyclic variation of the pressure,
hysteresis is observed. Following a pressure quench, the orientational
persistence exhibits a two-stage decay characteristic of glassy systems.

Each agent is assumed to own one or more elements of a set system, and the

Our goal is to design auctions that are truthful and false-name-proof, meaning
that it is in the agents' best interest to reveal ownership of all elements
(which may not be known to the auctioneer a priori) as well as their true
incurred costs.
  We first propose and analyze a false-name-proof mechanism for the special
case where each agent owns only one element in reality, but may pretend that
this element is in fact a set of multiple elements. We prove that its frugality
ratio is bounded by $2^n$, which, up to constants, matches a lower bound of
$\Omega(2^n)$ for all false-name-proof mechanisms in this scenario. We then
propose a second mechanism for the general case in which agents may own
multiple elements. It requires the auctioneer to choose a reserve cost a
priori, and thus does not always purchase a solution. In return, it is
false-name-proof even when agents own multiple elements. We experimentally
evaluate the payment (as well as social surplus) of the second mechanism
through simulation.

Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in the Galaxy, we show that if the LMC initially
has an extended old stellar halo before its commencement of tidal interaction
with the Galaxy, physical properties of the stars stripped from the LMC stellar
halo can have fossil information as to when and where the LMC was accreted onto
the Galaxy for the first time. If the epoch of the first LMC accretion onto the
Galaxy from outside its viriral radius is more than ~4 Gyr ago (i.e., at least
two pericenter passages), the stars stripped from the stellar halo of the LMC
can form an irregular polar ring or a thick disk with a size of ~100 kpc and
rotational kinematics. On the other hand, if the LMC was first accreted onto
the Galaxy quite recently (~ 2 Gyr ago), the stripped stars form shorter
leading and trailing stellar stream at R=50-120 kpc. Also distributions of the
stripped stars in phase space between the two cases can be significantly
different. The derived differences in structure and kinematics of the stripped
stars therefore suggest that if we compare the observed three-dimensional (3D)
distribution and kinematics of the outer Galactic stellar halo along the
polar-axis, then we can give strong constraints on the past orbit of the LMC.
We find that the orbital properties of the LMC in the successful formation
models of the Magellanic Stream (MS) are consistent with those predicted from
recent LambdaCDM cosmological simulations. We conclude that the LMC was
accreted onto the Galaxy more than ~4 Gyr ago so that interaction between the
LMC, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the Galaxy could form the MS and its
Leading Arms (LAs).

three regions: the flat region, the knee region, and the exponential region.
Practical considerations, usually locate the knee region between 70-90% of the
theoretical maximum utilization. However, there is not a clear agreement about
where the boundaries between regions are, and where exactly the utilization
knee is located. An open debate about knees in performance curves was
undertaken at least 20 years ago. This historical debate is mainly divided
between those who claim that a knee in the curve is not a well-defined term in
mathematics, or it is a subjective and not really meaningful concept, and those
who define knees mathematically and consider their relevance and application.
In this paper, we present a mathematical model and analysis for identifying the
three mentioned regions on performance curves for M/M/1 systems; specifically,
we found the knees, or optimal utilization percentiles, at the vertices of the
hyperbolas that relate response time as a function of utilization. Using these
results, we argue that an adaptive and optimal queuing system could be deployed
by keeping load and throughput within the knee region.

We report two novel phenomena, namely a large magnetoresistivity in Sr2IrO4

no apparent correlation with the magnetization, and a robust metallic state
that is induced by dilute electron (La3+) or hole (K+) doping for Sr2+ ions in
Sr2IrO4. Our structural, transport and magnetic data reveal that a strong
spin-orbit interaction alters the balance between the competing energies so
profoundly that (1) the spin degree of freedom alone is no longer a dominant
force; (2) underlying transport properties delicately hinge on the Ir-O-Ir bond
angle via a strong magnetoelastic coupling; and (3) a highly insulating state
in Sr2IrO4 is proximate to a metallic state, and the transition is governed by
lattice distortions. This work suggests that a novel class of lattice-driven
electronic materials can be developed for applications.

independently from the existing Hipparcos} measurement. We determined dynamical
masses from high-precision astrometry of the orbits of Aab-B and Aa-Ab using
adaptive optics (VLT/NACO) and optical interferometry (VLTI/AMBER). The main
component is an eclipsing binary composed of two early A-type stars in rapid
rotation. We modeled the photometric and radial velocity measurements of the
eclipsing pair Aa-Ab using a self consistent method based on physical
parameters (mass, radius, luminosity, rotational velocity). From our
self-consistent modeling of the primary and secondary components of the delta
Vel A eclipsing pair, we derive their fundamental parameters with a typical
accuracy of 1%. We find that they have similar masses, respectively

and spontaneous magnetization emerge at different temperatures when the ground

induces spin coherence of noncondensed atoms in different magnetic sublevels,
resulting in temperature-dependent magnetization of the noncondensate. We also
examine the effect of quantum fluctuations on the order parameter at absolute
zero, and find that the ground-state phase diagram is significantly altered by

laboratory data on bidirectional reflectance versus phase angle for two sample
sizes of 0.3 and 1 $\mu m$ of Alumina for the He-Ne laser at 632.8 nm (red) and
543.5nm(green) wavelength. The nature of the phase curves of the asteroids
depends on the parameters like- particle size, composition, porosity, roughness
etc. In our present work we analyse the data which are being generated using
single scattering phase function i.e. Mie theory considering particles to be
compact sphere. The well known Hapke formula will be considered along with
different particle phase function such as Mie and Henyey Greenstein etc to
model the laboratory data obtained at the asteroid laboratory of Assam
University.

  IIP","Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/736/2/76",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present optical photometric and low-resolution spectroscopic observations
of the Type II plateau supernova (SN) 2008in, which occurred in the outskirts
of the nearly face-on spiral galaxy M 61. Photometric data in the X-rays,
ultraviolet and near-infrared bands have been used to characterize this event.
The SN field was imaged with the ROTSE-IIIb optical telescope about seven days
before the explosion. This allowed us to constrain the epoch of the shock
breakout to JD = 2454825.6. The duration of the plateau phase, as derived from
the photometric monitoring, was ~ 98 days. The spectra of SN 2008in show a
striking resemblance to those of the archetypal low-luminosity IIP SNe 1997D
and 1999br. A comparison of ejecta kinematics of SN 2008in with the
hydrodynamical simulations of Type IIP SNe by Dessart et al. (2010) indicates
that it is a less energetic event (~ 5$\times10^{50}$ erg). However, the light
curve indicates that the production of radioactive $^{56}$Ni is significantly
higher than that in the low-luminosity SNe. Adopting an interstellar absorption
along the SN direction of $A_V$ ~ 0.3 mag and a distance of 13.2 Mpc, we
estimated a synthesized Ni mass of ~ 0.015 $M_{\odot}$. Employing
semi-analytical formulae (Litvinova & Nadezhin 1985), we derived a pre-SN
radius of ~ 126$R_{\odot}$, an explosion energy of ~ 5.4$\times10^{50}$ erg and
a total ejected mass of ~ 16.7$M_{\odot}$. The latter indicates that the zero
age main-sequence mass of the progenitor did not exceed 20$M_{\odot}$.
Considering the above properties of SN 2008in, and its occurrence in a region
of sub-solar metallicity ([O/H] ~ 8.44 dex), it is unlikely that fall-back of
the ejecta onto a newly formed black hole occurred in SN 2008in. We therefore
favor a low-energy explosion scenario of a relatively compact, moderate-mass
progenitor star that generates a neutron star.

is used to illuminate the object to be imaged and the photons Compton scattered
are detected by means of a surrounding germanium strip detector. The impact
position and the energy of the photons are measured with high precision and the
scattering position along the beam axis is calculated. We study as an
application of this technique the case of brain imaging but the results can be
applied as well to situations where a lighter object, with localized variations
of density, is embedded in a denser container. We report here the attainable
sensitivity in the detection of density variations as a function of the beam
energy, the depth inside the object and size and density of the inclusions.
Using a 600 keV gamma beam, for an inclusion with a density increase of 30%
with respect to the sorrounding tissue and thickness along the beam of 5 mm, we
obtain at midbrain position a resolution of about 2 mm and a contrast of 12%.
In addition the simulation indicates that for the same gamma beam energy a
complete brain scan would result in an effective dose of about 1 mSv.

collisions, discriminating between different models of hard parton-medium
interactions has been difficult. A key reason is that the pQCD parton spectrum
at RHIC is falling so steeply that distinguishing even a moderate shift in
parton energy from complete parton absorption is essentially impossible. In
essence, energy loss models are effectively only probed in the vicinity of zero
energy loss and, as a result, at RHIC energies only the pathlength dependence
of energy loss offers some discriminating power. At LHC however, this is no
longer the case: Due to the much flatter shape of the parton p_T spectra
originating from 2.76 AGeV collisions, the available data probe much deeper
into the model dynamics. A simultaneous fit of the nuclear suppression at both
RHIC and LHC energies thus has great potential for discriminating between
various models that yield equally good descriptions of RHIC data alone.

electrons and photons. However, in physics we have a special category of
objects with no clear counterparts in information theory: quasiparticles. They
are introduced to simplify complex emergent phenomena making otherwise very
difficult calculations possible and providing additional insight into the inner
workings of the system. We show that we can adopt a similar approach in
information theory. We introduce the hyperbits, the first information
quasiparticles which we prove to be a resource equivalent to entanglement and
classical communication, and give examples how they can be used to simplify
calculations and get more insight into communication protocols.

the motion of dust particles in debris disks, causing a significant dynamical
evolution. Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited and
strong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical
behaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause
significant asymmetries in dusty disks around solar type stars which might be
detected by observations. However, the amount of orbital changes due to this
non--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime
of dust particles. We show that for large values of the disk's optical depth
the influence of ISM flow on the disk shape is almost negligible because the
grains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital
changes due to the ISM perturbations. On the other hand, for values smaller
than $10^{-3}$, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of
the disk when we consider 1-10 mum grains, just above the blow-out threshold.
The extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the
optical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which may prevent the formation of
large clumps and warping in the disks is related to the fast inward migration
due to the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is
pumped up by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson and in
particular ISM drag) drive the disk particles on fast migrating tracks leading
them into the star on a short timescale. It is then expected that disks with
small optical depth expand inside the parent body ring all the way towards the
star while disks with large optical depth would not significantly extend
inside.

the enhanced wind from the active hot star. To test this idea, we applied the
wind compression model to active hot stars in symbiotic binaries, within which
the wind particles are compressed more to the equatorial plane due to a fast
rotation of the hot star. Accordingly, we calculated the ionization structure
for such compressed wind and ionizing photons from the hot star. We found that
the hot star wind, enhanced during active phases to \sim (10^-7 - 10^-6) M_sun
yr^-1, and the rotational velocity of 100 - 350 km s^-1 at the star's equator
lead to formation of a neutral disk-shaped zone. The presence of such disks is
transient, being connected with the active phases of symbiotic binaries. During
quiescent phases, such neutral disks cannot be created, because of insufficient
mass loss rate.

universal cover of the three dimensional Euclidean group of two dimensions.
Thus extraordinary light rays are geodesics of a left-invariant metric on this
Bianchi type VII(0) group. We are able to solve by separation of variables both
the wave equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for this metric. The former
reduces to Mathieu's equation and the later to the quadrantal pendulum
equation. We discuss Maxwell's equations for uniaxial optical materials where
the configuration is invariant under a group action and develop a formalism to
take advantage of these symmetries. The material is not assumed to be impedance
matched, thus going beyond the usual scope of transformation optics. We show
that for a chiral nematic in its helical phase Maxwell's equations reduce to a
generalised Mathieu equation. Our results may also be relevant to helical
phases of some magnetic materials and to light propagation in certain
cosmological models.

High energy protons can produce ~0.1-10 PeV neutrinos through photomeson

but rather are associations. These are likely to disperse into the field on
timescales of tens of Myr due to their lower stellar densities and not due to
gas expulsion (i.e. they were never gravitationally bound). We split the sample
into two discrete fields (inner and outer regions of the galaxy) and search for
evidence of environmentally dependent cluster disruption. Colour-colour
diagrams of the clusters, when compared to simple stellar population models,
already indicate that a much larger fraction of the clusters in the outer field

Self-dual additive codes over GF(9) have been classified up to length 8, and in

The classification is obtained by using a new algorithm that combines two graph

at the onset of accretion. Simultaneously, we derive constraints on average
accretion rate Mdot and the pre-accretion magnetic field B_i. Spin-up is
modelled by accretion from a thin disk, using the magnetic-torque disk-pulsar
coupling model proposed by Kluzniak and Rappaport (2007), improved for the
existence of relativistic marginally-stable circular orbit. Orbital parameters
in the disk are obtained using the space-time generated by a rotating neutron
star in the framework of General Relativity. We employ an observationally
motivated model of the surface magnetic field decay. We also seek for the
imprint of the poorly known equation of state of dense matter on the spin-up
tracks - three equations of state of dense matter, consistent with the
existence of 2 Msun neutron star, are considered. We find that the minimum
average accretion rate should be larger than 2-8 10^(-10) Msun/yr, the highest
lower bound corresponding to the stiffest equation of state. We conclude that
the influence of magnetic field in the ""recycling"" process is crucial - it
leads to a significant decrease of spin-up rate and larger accreted masses, in
comparison to the B=0 model. Allowed B_i-dependent values of M_i are within
1.0-1.4 Msun, i.e., much lower than an oversimplified but widely used B=0
result, where one gets M_i>1.55 Msun. Estimated initial neutron-star mass
depends on the assumed dense-matter equation of state.

sonic (Mach<=1.05). The apparent pressure of the radio lobes, based on the
synchrotron minimum energy density argument, is a factor of 5 lower than that

cool core, which should probably be categorised as a galactic corona. The
corona is capable of fuelling the active nucleus for considerably longer than
the inferred source lifetime, but can be only inefficiently heated by the AGN

the gas in the galaxy, compressing and moving the material of the corona
without causing significant shock heating, and expelling gas from the immediate
neighbourhood of the jets. We discuss the possible implications of this

important for analyzing the cosmological aspect of supersymmetric axion model.
Related to axino cosmology, it is stressed that three seemingly similar but
basically different quantities, the Wilsonian axino-gluino-gluon coupling, the
1PI axino-gluino-gluon amplitude, and the PQ anomaly coefficient, should be
carefully distinguished from each other for correct analysis of the thermal
production of axinos in the early Universe. It is then noticed that the 1PI
axino-gluino-gluon amplitude at energy scale p in the range M_\Phi < p < v_{PQ}
is suppressed by (M_\Phi ^2)/(p^2) in addition to the well-known suppression by
p/(16\pi^2 v_{PQ}), where M_\Phi is the mass of the heaviest PQ-charged and
gauge-charged matter supermultiplet in the model, which can be well below the
PQ scale v_{PQ}. As a result, axino production at temperature T>M_\Phi is
dominated by the production by matter supermultiplet, not by the production by
gauge supermultiplet. Still the axino production rate is greatly reduced if
M_\Phi << v_{PQ}, which would make the subsequent cosmology significantly
altered. This would be most notable in the supersymmetric DFSZ model in which
M_\Phi corresponds to the Higgsino mass which is around the weak scale, however
a similar reduction is possible in the KSVZ model also. We evaluate the relic
axino density for both the DFSZ and KSVZ models while including the axino

family of Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei. The occurrence of emission line
profiles not broader than 2000 km/s, combined with luminosity estimates
comparable to those of their broad line emitting analogues, suggests that some
extreme property is characterizing the fueling of their central engines. Two
hypotheses are more commonly considered: on the one hand, it was suggested that
the peculiar features of NLS1s might be interpreted as the consequence of a
nearly pole-on view over a geometrically flattened source; on the other, there
are arguments favoring the interpretation of a relatively low mass black hole,
accreting at very high rates. Both explanations provide advantages and
drawbacks, but, in spite of the different assumed physics, they agree in
identifying NLS1s as the crucial test ground for our understanding of the Broad
Line Region structure and dynamics in AGN. Here we report the results obtained
investigating asynchronous optical and X-ray spectroscopic observations,
respectively extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the XMM-Newton
science archives, of a sample of both broad and narrow line emitting Seyfert 1
galaxies. Exploiting data collected by the different instruments carried on
board XMM, we try to identify the various components which sum up in the
observed broad band spectra of the two classes. We discuss the relation that
thermal, non-thermal, line emission and broad band absorption components of the
X-ray source show with the optical emission line profiles, as interpreted in
the framework of a composite Broad Emission Line Region structural model.

number plus two and the arc index of prime nonalternating knots is less than or
equal to the minimal crossing number. We study some cases when the arc index is
strictly less than the minimal crossing number. We also give minimal grid
diagrams of some prime nonalternating knots with 13 crossings and 14 crossings
whose arc index is the minimal crossing number minus one.
