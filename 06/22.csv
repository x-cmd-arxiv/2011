Although ess(f)$ is clearly a lower bound on cnf_size(f) (the minimum number of
clauses in a CNF formula for f), Cepek et al. showed that it is not, in
general, a tight lower bound. They gave examples of functions f for which there
is a small gap between ess(f) and cnf_size(f). We demonstrate significantly
larger gaps. We show that the gap can be exponential in n for arbitrary Boolean

scattering has been observed. It is found that the resistivity in the normal

concentration, which is very different from the electron doped counterpart
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$, where the resistivity at 300 K reduces to
half value of the undoped one when the system is optimally doped. In stark
contrast, the Hall coefficient R$_H$ changes suddenly from a negative value in
the undoped sample to a positive one with slight K-doping, and it keeps
lowering with further doping. We interpret this dichotomy due to the asymmetric
scattering rate in the hole and the electron pockets with much higher mobility
of the latter. The magnetoresistivity shows also a non-monotonic doping
dependence indicating an anomalous feature at about 80 K to 100 K, even in the
optimally doped sample, which is associated with a possible pseudogap feature.
In the low temperature region, it seems that the resistivity has the similar
values when superconductivity sets in disregarding the different T$_c$ values,
which indicates a novel mechanism of the superconductivity. A linear feature of
resistivity $\rho_{ab}$ vs. $T$ was observed just above $T_c$ for the optimally
doped sample, suggesting a quantum criticality.

solar case and were shown to reduce the tensions between the data and the large
mixing angle solution predictions. We extend the previous framework to the
supernova and evaluate the appearance probabilities for neutrinos and
antineutrinos as a function of their energy after leaving the collapsing star
with and without NSI. For normal hierarchy the probability for electron
neutrinos and antineutrinos at low energy ($E\lesssim 0.8-0.9 MeV$) is
substantially increased with respect to the non-NSI case and joins its value
for inverse hierarchy which is constant with energy. Also for inverse hierarchy
the NSI and non-NSI probabilities are the same for each neutrino and
antineutrino species. Although detection in such a low energy range remains at
present an experimental challenge, it will become a visible trace of NSI with
normal hierarchy if they exist. On the other hand the neutrino decay
probability into an antineutrino and a majoron, an effect previously shown to
be induced by dense matter, is, as in the case of the sun, too small to be
observed as a direct consequence of NSI.

acceleration of solar wind. Here we investigated the statistical properties of
Alfv\'enic waves along spicules (jets that protrude into the corona) in a polar
coronal hole using high cadence observations of the Solar Optical Telescope
(SOT) onboard \emph{Hinode}. We developed a technique for the automated
detection of spicules and high-frequency waves. We detected 89 spicules, and
found: (1) a mix of upward propagating, downward propagating, as well as
standing waves (occurrence rates of 59%, 21%, and 20%, respectively). (2) The
phase speed gradually increases with height. (3) Upward waves dominant at lower
altitudes, standing waves at higher altitudes. (4) Standing waves dominant in
the early and late phases of each spicule, while upward waves were dominant in
the middle phase. (5) In some spicules, we find waves propagating upward (from
the bottom) and downward (from the top) to form a standing wave in the middle
of the spicule. (6) The medians of the amplitude, period, and velocity
amplitude were 55 km, 45 s, and 7.4 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. We speculate
that upward propagating waves are produced near the solar surface (below the
spicule) and downward propagating waves are caused by reflection of (initially)
upward propagating waves off the transition region at the spicule top. The mix
of upward and downward propagating waves implies that exploiting these waves to
perform seismology of the spicular environment requires careful analysis and
may be problematic.

inferred from millimeter and sub-millimeter observations. Supporting mm-wave

EVLA survey has resulted in a robust detection of our most prominent submm
emission source, the pre-planetary nebula IRAS 22036+5306, in all three bands,
and the disk-prominent post-AGB object, RV Tau, in one band. The observed
fluxes are consistent with optically-thin free-free emission, and since they
are insignificant compared to their submm/mm fluxes, we conclude that the
latter must come from substantial masses of cool, large (mm-sized) grains. We
find that the power-law emissivity in the cm-to-submm range for the large
grains in IRAS22036 is nu^{beta}, with beta=1-1.3. Furthermore, the value of
beta in the 3 to 0.85 mm range for the three disk-prominent post-AGB sources
(beta < or = 0.4) is significantly lower than that of IRAS22036, suggesting
that the grains in post-AGB objects with circumbinary disks are likely larger
than those in the dusty waists of pre-planetary nebulae.

that the black hole formed in a supernova or hypernova explosion. We explore
different supernova/hypernova models having various geometries to study
possible contamination of nucleosynthetic products in the chemical abundance

anisotropic diffusion has a negligible effect on the linear relaxation of the

$Q^{2}$, where $Q\ll 1$ is the wavenumber of a transverse perturbation to the

their central black holes. We use 100um and 160um fluxes from GOODS-Herschel
-the deepest survey yet undertaken by the Herschel telescope- and show that in
>94 per cent of cases these fluxes are dominated by the host. We find no
evidence of any correlation between the X-ray and infrared luminosities of
moderate AGNs at any redshift, suggesting that star-formation is decoupled from
nuclear (AGN) activity. The star formation rates of AGN hosts increase strongly
with redshift; by a factor of 43 from z<0.1 to z=2-3 for AGNs with the same
X-ray luminosities. This increase is consistent with the factor of 25-50
increase in the specific star formation rates (SSFRs) of normal, star-forming
(main-sequence) galaxies. Indeed, the average SSFRs of AGN hosts are only
marginally (20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies, with this
small deficit being due to a fraction of AGNs residing in quiescent (low-SSFR)
galaxies. We estimate 79+/-10 per cent of moderate AGNs are hosted in
main-sequence galaxies, 15+/-7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and <10 per cent
in strongly starbursting galaxies. The fractions of all main sequence galaxies
at z<2 experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity is strongly dependent
on galaxy stellar mass (Mstars); rising from a few per cent at
Mstars~10^{10}Msun to >20 per cent at Mstars>10^{11}Msun. Our results indicate

discrete memoryless channel, and obtain an inner bound for the capacity region
by using an achievable scheme that uses superposition coding and binning. Next,
we obtain an outer bound, and show that this outer bound partially matches the
inner bound, providing a partial characterization for the capacity region of
the degraded channel model. Second, we obtain an inner bound for the general,
not necessarily degraded, discrete memoryless channel by using Marton's inner
bound, superposition coding, rate-splitting and binning. Third, we consider the
degraded Gaussian MIMO channel, and show that, to evaluate both the inner and
outer bounds, considering only jointly Gaussian auxiliary random variables and
channel input is sufficient. Since the inner and outer bounds partially match,
these sufficiency results provide a partial characterization of the capacity

high ambient dimension, that is, when the number of variables is very large.
The main focus is on the situation where the number of relevant variables,
called intrinsic dimension, is much smaller than the ambient dimension d.
Without assuming any parametric form of the underlying regression function, we
get tight conditions making it possible to consistently estimate the set of
relevant variables. These conditions relate the intrinsic dimension to the
ambient dimension and to the sample size. The procedure that is provably
consistent under these tight conditions is based on comparing quadratic
functionals of the empirical Fourier coefficients with appropriately chosen
threshold values. The asymptotic analysis reveals the presence of two quite
different re gimes. The first regime is when the intrinsic dimension is fixed.
In this case the situation in nonparametric regression is the same as in linear
regression, that is, consistent variable selection is possible if and only if
log d is small compared to the sample size n. The picture is different in the
second regime, that is, when the number of relevant variables denoted by s
tends to infinity as $n\to\infty$. Then we prove that consistent variable
selection in nonparametric set-up is possible only if s+loglog d is small
compared to log n. We apply these results to derive minimax separation rates

spacetime are akin to coordinates in general relativity and hence are
physically meaningless. This moral is given an explicit demonstration by giving
the correspondence between the coordinates on phase space for a field theory
and the particle number. Usually the ambiguity in particle definitions is only
as varied as the possible sets of observers on the spacetime. However, there is
a greater choice in coordinates on the phase space, especially for a field
system with infinite degrees of freedom. Hence, for one set of coordinates on
the spacetime (one class of comoving observers) there are many different
coordinates to choose on the phase space. This demonstrates the true
vacuousness of the concept of particles when defined as energy levels of the
harmonic oscillator. In order to give a definition of particles we must specify
the apparatus that detects them. The Unruh-Dewitt detector is one such
apparatus, so we are not surprised to find that it gives a physically
meaningful definition of particles. We give an explicit example on de Sitter
spacetime and explain how the definition of particles as energy levels of the
harmonic oscillator is meaningless even in simple cases. This is done first by
comparing the response of an Unruh-Dewitt detector to the expectation of the
number operator. Second, we demonstrate that by a choice of coordinates on
phase space one can turn the Hamiltonian of a free Klein-Gordon field on FRW
with flat spatial sections into a set of harmonic oscillators with
time-independent mass and frequency. Also, we demonstrate a new method for
determining the wave functional of known states such as the conformal vacuum.

galaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological K-correction, with
size being slightly smaller in the optical than in the UV rest-frame (by ~20
and ~10 at z>1.2 and z<1.2, respectively). We measure a significant evolution
of the mass-size relation of early-type galaxies, with the fractional increment
that is almost independent on the stellar mass. Early-type galaxies (ETGs)
formed at z>1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of the
mass-size relation at z<1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of the
compact galaxies and the appearance of new ETGs with large sizes. We also find
that the number density of all passive early-type galaxies increases rapidly,
by a factor of 5, from z~2 to z~1, and then more mildly by another factor of
1.5 from z~1 to z~0. We interpret these results as the evidence that the bulk
of the ETGs are formed at 1<z<3 through a mechanism that leaves very compact
remnants. At z<1 the compact ETGs grow gradually in size, becoming normal size
galaxies, and at the same time new ETGs with normal-large sizes are formed.

to favour a purely stochastic sampling of the initial mass function for
clusters less than 100M(Sun), rather than the maximum stellar mass being
dependant on the total cluster mass. It is more difficult to determine whether
the same is true for more massive clusters. We also find that binary stars blur
some of the observational differences that occur when a cluster-mass dependent
stellar upper-mass limit is imposed when filling the IMF. The effect is
greatest when modelling the observed H(alpha) and FUV star-formation rate
ratios in galaxies. This is because mass transfer and merging of stars owing to
binary evolution creates more massive stars and stars that have greater mass
than the initial maximum imposed on the stellar population.

models usually adopts a global search algorithm, often combined with a local
search method in order to minimize the value of a cost function, which measures
the discrepancy between various features of the available experimental data and
model output. In this study, we approach the problem of parameter estimation in
conductance-based models of single neurons from a different perspective. By
adopting a hidden-dynamical-systems formalism, we expressed parameter
estimation as an inference problem in these systems, which can then be tackled
using well-established statistical inference methods. The particular method we
used was Kitagawa's self-organizing state-space model, which was applied on a
number of Hodgkin-Huxley models using simulated or actual electrophysiological
data. We showed that the algorithm can be used to estimate a large number of
parameters, including maximal conductances, reversal potentials, kinetics of
ionic currents and measurement noise, based on low-dimensional experimental
data and sufficiently informative priors in the form of pre-defined constraints
imposed on model parameters. The algorithm remained operational even when very
noisy experimental data were used. Importantly, by combining the
self-organizing state-space model with an adaptive sampling algorithm akin to
the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy we achieved a significant
reduction in the variance of parameter estimates. The algorithm did not require
the explicit formulation of a cost function and it was straightforward to apply
on compartmental models and multiple data sets. Overall, the proposed
methodology is particularly suitable for resolving high-dimensional inference
problems based on noisy electrophysiological data and, therefore, a potentially
useful tool in the construction of biophysical neuron models.

wavefunctions and their residues. We employ these asymptotics to show
(approximately) that the QN mode sum is singular on the lightcone, and to
obtain approximations for the GF which are valid close to the lightcone. These
approximations confirm a little-known prediction: the singular part of the GF
undergoes a transition each time the lightcone passes through a caustic,

baryon number transfer between visible and dark sectors arises through new
physics at the weak scale. The possibility of induced nucleon decay motivates a
novel approach for direct detection of cosmic dark matter in nucleon decay
experiments. Monojet searches (and related signatures) at hadron colliders also
provide a complementary probe of weak-scale dark-matter--induced baryon number

galactic outflows and photoionization heating. By itself, an extragalactic
ultraviolet background (EUVB) suppresses the luminosity function by less than
50% at z=6, overproducing the observed galaxy abundance by a factor of 3-5.
Galactic outflows restore agreement with observations without preventing
Population II star formation from reionizing the Universe by z=6. The resulting
EUVB suppresses star formation in halos with virial temperatures below 10^5K
but has a weaker impact in more massive halos. Nonetheless, the low-mass halos
contribute up to 50% of all ionizing photons owing to the EUVB's inhomogeneity.
Overall, star formation rate scales as halo mass M_h to the 1.3-1.4 in halos
with $M_h=10^{8.2--10.2}\msun$. This is a steeper dependence than is often
assumed in reionization models, boosting the expected power spectrum of 21
centimeter fluctuations on large scales. The luminosity function rises steeply
to at least M_1600=-13, indicating that reionization was driven by faint
galaxies (M_1600 >= -15) that have not yet been observed. Our models cannot
simultaneously explain observations of galaxies, the cosmic microwave

alleviate the existing discrepancies, but observations may still require

enhancement factor is nearly independent of the applied magnetic field but

inter-subband particle-hole excitation continuums and anti-bound excitons,
arising from the anisotropic nature of dipolar interactions. The excitonic

inter-subband transition rates in order to investigate the nature of the

cylindrical rotation and a steeper vertical metallicity gradient. We adopt two
representative models for the bulge formation and thereby investigate whether
the two models can explain both the observed cylindrical rotation and vertical
metallicity gradient in a self-consistent manner. One is the ""pure disk
scenario"" (PDS) in which the bulge is formed from a pure thin stellar disk
through spontaneous bar instability. The other is the ""two-component disk
scenario"" (TCDS) in which the bulge is formed from a disk composed of thin and
thick disks through bar instability. Our numerical simulations show that
although PDS can reproduce the cylindrical rotation, it shows a rather flatter
vertical metallicity gradient that is inconsistent with observations. The
derived flatter metallicity gradient is due to the vertical mixing of stars
with different initial metallicities by the stellar bar. This result implies
that the bulge can not be simply formed from a pure thin stellar disk. On the
other hand, the bulge formed from the two-component disk in TCDS can explain
both the observed cylindrical rotation and vertical metallicity gradient of the
Galactic bulge reasonably well. In TCDS, more metal-poor stars at higher |z|
(vertical distance) which originate from the already dynamically hotter thick
disk can not be strongly influenced by vertical mixing of the bar so that they
can stay in situ for longer timescales and thus keep the lower metallicity at
higher |z|. Consequently, the vertical metallicity gradient of the bulge
composed of initially thin and thick disk stars can not be so flattened, even
if the gradient of the thin disk can be flattened significantly by the bar in
TCDS.

factors are calculated under the light-cone perturbative QCD approach, in which
both the valence and non-valence quarks' contributions have been taken into
consideration. To be consistent, an unified wavefunction model is adopted to
analyze these form factors. It is shown that with proper charm component
$f^{c}_{\eta'}\sim -30$ MeV and a moderate DA with $B\sim 0.30$, the
experimental data on $Q^{2}F_{\eta\gamma}(Q^2)$ and $Q^{2}F_{\eta'\gamma}(Q^2)$

discussion on the form factors' uncertainties caused by the constituent quark
masses $m_q$ and $m_s$, the parameter $B$, the mixing angle $\phi$ and
$f_{\eta'}^c$ are presented. It is found that by adjusting these parameters
within their reasonable regions, one can improve the form factor to a certain
degree but can not solve the puzzle for $Q^{2}F_{\pi\gamma}(Q^2)$, especially
to explain the behavior of $\pi-\gamma$ form factor within the whole $Q^2$

of field theory. It is shown to be a simultaneous transformation of the field

central to the Lagrangian approach and in the definition of the ""time"" ordered
products used in the Hamiltonian (or canonical) approach. This transformation
preserves the form of the S-matrix as ""time"" ordered products. The transformed
""time"" coordinate is the inverse ""time"" scale. This is traditionally the UV
cutoff or renormalization parameter in standard approaches to renormalization.
The critical calculation will be the determination of the form of the effective

as an integral of a Lagrangian density that is a function of the
renormalization parameter or transformed ""time"". Other symmetries of the action
can be explicitly built into the transformation. It will be demonstrated on a
simple 1D $\phi^4$ field theory. This non-perturbative approach has great
potential in possibly being used to renormalize quantum gravity and obtaining

because of Rashba Spin Orbit Interaction (structural inversion asymmetry) which

due to Elliot-Yafet(EY) mechanism also leads to spin relaxation. The spin
relaxation tests for both 1-D and 2-D channels are carried out at different
values of temperature and driving electric field and the variation in spin
relaxation length is recorded. Spin relaxation length in a nanowire is found to
be much higher than that in a 2-D channel due to suppression of DP relaxation
in a nanowire. At lower temperatures the spin relaxation length increases. This
suggests that spin relaxation in germanium occurs slowly in a 1-D channel
(nanowires) and at lower temperatures. The electric field dependence of spin

study, ZnO substrates are implanted with nitrogen ions, and the extended
defects induced by implantation are studied by transmission electron microscopy
and X-ray diffraction (XRD), before and after annealing at 900^{\circ}C. Before
annealing, these defects are identified to be dislocation loops lying either in
basal planes in high N concentration regions, or in prismatic planes in low N
concentration regions, together with linear dislocations. An uniaxial
deformation of 0.4% along the c axis, caused by the predominant basal loops, is
measured by XRD in the implanted layer. After annealing, prismatic loops
disappear while the density of basal loops decreases and their diameter
increases. Moreover, dislocation loops disappear completely from the
sub-surface region. XRD measurements show a residual deformation of only 0.05%
in the implanted and annealed layer. The fact that basal loops are favoured
against prismatic ones at high N concentration or high temperature is
attributed to a lower stacking fault energy in these conditions. The
coalescence of loops and their disappearance in the sub-surface region are
ascribed to point defect diffusion. Finally, the electrical and optical

a doubly stochastic renewal process (DSRP). Both the random environment and the
random arrival rate of each DSRP are driven by a finite state continuous time
Markov chain (FS-CTMC). Whereas the scheduling policy optimizes in a greedy
fashion with respect to each queue and environmental state and since the
closed-form solution for the performance of such a queueing system under the
policy is difficult to obtain, we establish a reflecting diffusion with
regime-switching (RDRS) model for its measures of performance and justify its
asymptotic optimality through deriving the stochastic fluid and diffusion
limits for the corresponding system under heavy traffic and identifying a cost
function related to the utility function, which is minimized through minimizing
the workload process in the diffusion limit. More importantly, our queueing
model includes both J-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiple access
channel (MAC) and broadcast channel (BC) with cooperation and admission control
as special cases. In these wireless systems, data from the J users in the MAC
or data to the J users in the BC is transmitted over a common channel that is
fading according to the FS-CTMC. The J-user capacity region for the MAC or the
BC is a set-valued stochastic process that switches with the FS-CTMC fading. In
any particular channel state, we show that each of the J-user capacity regions
is a convex set bounded by a number of linear or smooth curved facets.
Therefore our queueing model can perfectly match the dynamics of these wireless
systems.

of a species in different environments, the temporal properties of
environmental change, and selection for or against dispersal. Here, the
mathematics underlying these relationships in their two-environment model are
investigated for arbitrary numbers of environments. The effect they described
is quantified as the fitness-abundance covariance. The phase in the life cycle
where the population is censused is crucial for the implications of the
fitness-abundance covariance. These relationships are shown to connect to the
population genetics literature on the Reduction Principle for the evolution of
genetic systems and migration. Conditions that produce selection for increased
unconditional dispersal are found to be new instances of departures from
reduction described by the ""Principle of Partial Control"" proposed for the
evolution of modifier genes. According to this principle, variation that only
partially controls the processes that transform the transmitted information of
organisms may be selected to increase these processes. Mathematical methods of
Karlin, Friedland, and Elsner, Johnson, and Neumann, are central in
generalizing the analysis. Analysis of the adaptive landscape of the model
shows that the evolution of conditional dispersal is very sensitive to the
spectrum of genetic variation the population is capable of producing, and
suggests that empirical study of particular species will require an evaluation
of its variational properties.

the conduction electron spin relaxation dynamics is much faster than the

localized, which is common in experimental situations, we find that the
conservative part of the spin motive force is unable to generate the charge
current due to the cancelation effect by the diffusion current. We also find
that the spin current is a nonlocal function of the spin motive force and can
be effectively expressed in terms of nonlocal Gilbert damping tensor. It turns
out that any spin independent potential such as Coulomb potential does not
affect our principal results. At the last part of this paper, we apply our

power the VHE source in a hadronic scenario. The age of the proposed remnant
estimated from its extension possibly agrees with the occurrence of such events
in the Galaxy. Sub-relativistic merger ejecta could shock-heat the ambient

lower energies expected for particle acceleration in ultra-relativistic shocks.

A-type stars, HD 32115 and HD 37594, to uncover the reasons behind large
discrepancies between two previous analyses of these stars performed with a
semi-automatic procedure and a ""classical"" analysis. Our study is based on high
resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra obtained at the McDonald Observatory.
Our method is based on the simultaneous use of all available observables:
multicolor photometry, pressure-sensitive magnesium lines, metallic lines and
Balmer line profiles. Our final set of fundamental parameters fits, within the
error bars, all available observables. It differs from the published results
obtained with a semi-automatic procedure. A direct comparison between our new
observational material and the spectra previously used by other authors shows
that the quality of the data is not the origin of the discrepancies. As the two
stars require a substantial macroturbulence velocity to fit the line profiles,
we concluded that neglecting this additional broadening in the semi-automatic
analysis is one origin of discrepancy. The use of FeI excitation equilibrium
and of the Fe ionisation equilibrium, to derive effective temperature and
surface gravity, respectively, neglecting all other indicators leads to a
systematically erroneously high effective temperature. We deduce that the
results obtained using only one parameter indicator might be biased and that
those results need to be cautiously taken when performing further detailed
analyses, such as modelling of the asteroseismic frequencies or characterising
transiting exoplanets.

charge-driven quantum phase transitions is explored. The ground state phase
diagram of an extended Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice
relevant to quarter-filled layered organic materials contains homogeneous
metal, 'pinball' and three-fold charge ordered metallic phases. The stability
of the 'pinball' phase occurring for strong Coulomb repulsions is found to be
strongly influenced by geometrical frustration. A comparison with a spinless
model reproduces the transition from the homogeneous metallic phase to a
pinball liquid, which indicates that the spin correlations should play a much
smaller role than the charge correlations in the metallic phase close to the
charge ordering transition. Spin degeneracy is, however, essential to describe
the dependence of the system on geometrical frustration. Based on finite
temperature Lanczos diagonalization we find that the effective Fermi
temperature scale, T*, of the homogeneous metal vanishes at the quantum phase
transition to the ordered metallic phase driven by the Coulomb repulsion. Above
this temperature scale 'bad' metallic behavior is found which is robust against
geometrical frustration in general. Quantum critical phenomena are not found
whenever nesting of the Fermi surface is strong, possibly indicating a first
order transition instead. 'Reentrant' behavior in the phase diagram is
encountered whenever the 2kF-CDW instability competes with the Coulomb driven
three-fold charge order transition. The relevance of our results to the family
of quarter-filled materials: theta-(BEDT-TTF)2X is discussed.

data. After careful examination of data quality, the usable measurements free
from the zodiacal light are integrated into sky maps at the blue (~0.44 um) and
red (~0.64 um) bands. Accurate starlight subtraction is achieved by referring
to all-sky star catalogs and a Galactic stellar population synthesis model down
to 32.0 mag. We find that the residual light is separated into two components:
one component shows a clear correlation with thermal 100 um brightness, while
another betrays a constant level in the lowest 100 um brightness region.
Presence of the second component is significant after all the uncertainties and
possible residual light in the Galaxy are taken into account, thus it most
likely has the extragalactic origin (i.e., the COB). The derived COB brightness
is (1.8 +/- 0.9) x 10^(-9) and (1.2 +/- 0.9) x 10^(-9) erg/s/cm2/sr/A at the
blue and red band, respectively, or 7.9 +/- 4.0 and 7.7 +/- 5.8 nW/m2/sr. Based
on a comparison with the integrated brightness of galaxies, we conclude that
the bulk of the COB is comprised of normal galaxies which have already been
resolved by the current deepest observations. There seems to be little room for
contributions of other populations including ""first stars"" at these
wavelengths. On the other hand, the first component of the IPP residual light
represents the diffuse Galactic light (DGL) - scattered starlight by the
interstellar dust. We derive the mean DGL-to-100 um brightness ratios of 2.1 x
10^(-3) and 4.6 x 10^(-3) at the two bands, which are roughly consistent with
the previous observations toward denser dust regions. Extended red emission in
the diffuse interstellar medium is also confirmed.

Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We employ a two-dimensional grid-based code to

with recent SPH results. We show that this non-convergence is at least partly

nonlinear generalized minimal residual (N-GMRES) optimization algorithm for
unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Two steepest descent preconditioning
variants are proposed. The first employs a line search, while the second
employs a predefined small step. A simple global convergence proof is provided
for the N-GMRES optimization algorithm with the first steepest descent
preconditioner (with line search), under mild standard conditions on the
objective function and the line search processes. Steepest descent
preconditioning for N-GMRES optimization is also motivated by relating it to
standard non-preconditioned GMRES for linear systems in the case of a quadratic
optimization problem with symmetric positive definite operator. Numerical tests
on a variety of model problems show that the N-GMRES optimization algorithm is
able to very significantly accelerate convergence of stand-alone steepest
descent optimization. Moreover, performance of steepest-descent preconditioned
N-GMRES is shown to be competitive with standard nonlinear conjugate gradient
and limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno methods for the model
problems considered. These results serve to theoretically and numerically
establish steepest-descent preconditioned N-GMRES as a general optimization
method for unconstrained nonlinear optimization, with performance that appears
promising compared to established techniques. In addition, it is argued that
the real potential of the N-GMRES optimization framework lies in the fact that
it can make use of problem-dependent nonlinear preconditioners that are more
powerful than steepest descent (or, equivalently, N-GMRES can be used as a
simple wrapper around any other iterative optimization process to seek
acceleration of that process), and this potential is illustrated with a further
application example.

theories of gravity and we use the generalized 2nd law to discard an exact

have been proposed to understand the high degree of efficient energy transport,
most of them are limited to the scenario of single-exciton. Here we present a
study on the dynamics in light-harvesting complexes beyond the single exciton

process regression with a Student-t observation model. The challenge with the
Student-t model is the analytically intractable inference which is why several
approximative methods have been proposed. The expectation propagation (EP) has
been found to be a very accurate method in many empirical studies but the
convergence of the EP is known to be problematic with models containing
non-log-concave site functions such as the Student-t distribution. In this
paper we illustrate the situations where the standard EP fails to converge and
review different modifications and alternative algorithms for improving the
convergence. We demonstrate that convergence problems may occur during the
type-II maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the hyperparameters and show
that the standard EP may not converge in the MAP values in some difficult
cases. We present a robust implementation which relies primarily on parallel EP
updates and utilizes a moment-matching-based double-loop algorithm with
adaptively selected step size in difficult cases. The predictive performance of
the EP is compared to the Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo approximations.

restricting the support to a finite grid, a simulated annealing method is
employed to maximize the marginal likelihood and estimate the support. Real and

impurity systems with potential scattering and orbital degeneracy. Using the
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) method, static and dynamic
physical quantities are derived in a wide temperature range across the Kondo
temperature T_K. With strong potential scattering, the resistivity tends to
decrease with decreasing temperature, in contrast to the ordinary Kondo effect.
Correspondingly, the quasi-particle density of states obtains the antiresonance
around the Fermi level. Thermopower also shows characteristic deviation from
the standard Kondo behavior, while magnetic susceptibility follows the
universal temperature dependence even with strong potential scattering. It is
found that the t-matrix in the presence of potential scattering is not a
relevant quantity for the Friedel sum rule, for which a proper limit of the
f-electron Green's function is introduced. The optical theorem is also
discussed in the context of Kondo impurity models with potential scattering. It
is shown that optical theorem holds not only in the Fermi-liquid range but also
for large energies, and therefore is less restrictive than the Friedel sum
rule.

suggest that the discrepant results occur primarily because most of previous
studies have not simultaneously investigated the X-ray to near-IR spectral
energy distribution of this GRB. The difficulty with this burst is that the
X-ray afterglow is dominated by strong flares at early times and is poorly
monitored at late times. In addition, the Z band photometry, which is the most
sensitive to dust extinction, has been found to be affected by strong
systematics. In this paper we carefully re-analyze the Swift/XRT afterglow
observations of this GRB, using extensive past studies of X-ray flare
properties when computing the X-ray afterglow flux level and exploiting the
recent reanalysis of the optical (UV rest frame) data of the same GRB. We
extract the X-ray to optical/near-IR afterglow SED for the three epochs where
the best spectral coverage is available: 0.47, 1.25, and 3.4 days after the
trigger. A spectral power-law model has been fitted to the extracted SEDs. We
discuss that no spectral breaks or chromatic temporal breaks are expected in
the epochs of interest. To fit any UV rest-frame dust absorption, we tested the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve, the mean extinction curve (MEC)
found for a sample of QSO at $z>4$ and its corresponding attenuation curve, as
well as a starburst attenuation curve, and the extinction curve consistent with
a supernova dust origin (SN-type). The SMC extinction curve and the SN-type one
provide good fit to the data at all epochs, with an average amount of dust
absorption at $\lambda_{rest} = 3000 \AA$ of $A_{3000} = 0.25\pm 0.07$ mag.
These results indicate that the primeval galaxy at $z = 6.3$ hosting this GRB
has already enriched its ISM with dust.

behavior of genetic and biochemical reaction networks. An appropriate
stochastic description is provided by the chemical master equation, which
represents a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). In this paper we consider the
stochastic properties of a biochemical circuit, known to control eukaryotic
cell cycle and possibly involved in oncogenesis, recently proposed in the
literature within a deterministic framework. Due to the inherent stochasticity
of biochemical processes and the small number of molecules involved, the
stochastic approach should be more correct in describing the real system: we
study the agreement between the two approaches by exploring the system
parameter space. We address the problem by proposing a simplified version of
the model that allows analytical treatment, and by performing numerical
simulations for the full model. We observed optimal agreement between the
stochastic and the deterministic description of the circuit in a large range of
parameters, but some substantial differences arise in at least two cases: 1)
when the deterministic system is in the proximity of a transition from a
monostable to a bistable configuration, and 2) when bistability (in the
deterministic system) is ""masked"" in the stochastic system by the distribution
tails. The approach provides interesting estimates of the optimal number of
molecules involved in the toggle. Our discussion of the points of strengths,
potentiality and weakness of the chemical master equation in systems biology
and the differences with respect to deterministic modeling are leveraged in
order to provide useful advice for both the bioinformatician practitioner and
the theoretical scientist.

deterministic studies and the increasing work aimed to elucidate the effect of
noise in such systems, some aspects remain unclear. Here we study the
stationary distribution provided by the two-dimensional Chemical Master
Equation for a well known model of a two step phospho/dephosphorylation cycle
using the quasi steady state approximation of the enzymatic kinetics. Our aim
is to analyze the role of fluctuations and the molecules distribution
properties in the transition to a bistable regime. When detailed balance
conditions are satisfied it is possible to compute equilibrium distributions in
a closed and explicit form. When detailed balance is not satisfied, the
stationary non-equilibrium state is strongly influenced by the chemical fluxes.
In the last case, we show how the Helmholtz decomposition of the external field
associated to the generation and recombination transition rates, into a
conservative and a rotational (irreversible) part, allows to compute the
stationary distribution via a perturbative approach . For a finite number of
molecules, there exists diffusion dynamics in a macroscopic region of the state
space, where a relevant transition rate between the two critical points is
observed. Further, the stationary distribution function can be approximated by
the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation. We illustrate the theoretical results
using several numerical simulations.

provide conditions guaranteeing that $H$ is transversal to $M'$ along all of
$M$. In the strictly pseudoconvex case, this is well known and follows from the
classical Hopf boundary lemma. In the equidimensional case ($N=n$),
transversality holds for maps of full generic rank provided that the source is
of finite type in view of recent results by the authors (see also a previous
paper by the first author and L. Rothschild). In the positive codimensional
case ($N>n$), the situation is more delicate as examples readily show. In
recent work by S. Baouendi, the first author, and L. Rothschild, conditions
were given guaranteeing that the map $H$ is transversal outside a proper
subvariety of $M$, and examples were given showing that transversality may fail
at certain points.
  One of the results in this paper implies that if $N\le 2n-2$, $M'$ is
Levi-nondegenerate, and $H$ has maximal rank outside a complex subvariety of
codimension 2, then $H$ is transversal to $M'$ at all points of $M$. We show by
examples that this conclusion fails in general if $N\geq 2n$, or if the set
$W_H$ of points where $H$ is not of maximal rank has codimension one. We also
show that $H$ is transversal at all points if $H$ is assumed to be a finite map

role as biodeteriorators wood-decay fungi can be used for biotechnological

Therefore, the visualization and the quantification of microscopic decay

size-distribution) of CWE of the tracheids in a sample. This is essential for
modeling the influence of microscopic CWE to macroscopic properties such as
wood strength and permeability.

with a \textit{noncentrosymmetric} spacegroup $Im$ which contrasts the
\textit{centrosymmetric} one $I2/m$ previously reported for the isovalent and
isomorphic compound LaMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$, which gives evidence of a
Bi$^{3+}$-induced polarization of the lattice. At low temperature, the two
Mn$^{3+}$ sublattices of the $A'$ and $B$ sites order antiferromagnetically
(AFM) in an independent manner at 25 and 55 K, similarly to the case of
LaMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$. However, both magnetic structures of
BiMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ radically differ from those of LaMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$.
In BiMn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ the moments $\textbf{M}_{A'}$ of the $A'$ sites form
an anti-body AFM structure, whilst the moments \textbf{M}$_{B}$ of the $B$
sites result from a large and \textit{uniform} modulation $\pm
\textbf{M}_{B,b}$ along the b-axis of the moments \textbf{M}$_{B,ac}$ in the

the Mn$^{3+}$ ions induced by the Bi$^{3+}$ ions. Our analysis unveils a strong
magnetoelastic coupling between the internal strain created by the Bi$^{3+}$
ions and the moment of the Mn$^{3+}$ ions in the $B$ sites. This is ascribed to
the high symmetry of the oxygen sites and to the absence of oxygen defects, two
characteristics of quadruple perovskites not found in simple ones, which
prevent the release of the Bi$^{3+}$-induced strain through distortions or
disorder. This demonstrates the possibility of a large magnetoelectric coupling

  Data: Minimax Global Convergence Rates and Adaptivity","45 pages",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the nonparametric regression estimation problem of recovering an
unknown response function f on the basis of spatially inhomogeneous data when
the design points follow a known compactly supported density g with a finite
number of well separated zeros. In particular, we consider two different cases:
when g has zeros of a polynomial order and when g has zeros of an exponential
order. These two cases correspond to moderate and severe data losses,
respectively. We obtain asymptotic minimax lower bounds for the global risk of
an estimator of f and construct adaptive wavelet nonlinear thresholding
estimators of f which attain those minimax convergence rates (up to a
logarithmic factor in the case of a zero of a polynomial order), over a wide
range of Besov balls.
  The spatially inhomogeneous ill-posed problem that we investigate is
inherently more difficult than spatially homogeneous problems like, e.g.,
deconvolution. In particular, due to spatial irregularity, assessment of
minimax global convergence rates is a much harder task than the derivation of
minimax local convergence rates studied recently in the literature.
Furthermore, the resulting estimators exhibit very different behavior and
minimax global convergence rates in comparison with the solution of spatially
homogeneous ill-posed problems. For example, unlike in deconvolution problem,
the minimax global convergence rates are greatly influenced not only by the
extent of data loss but also by the degree of spatial homogeneity of f.
Specifically, even if 1/g is not integrable, one can recover f as well as in
the case of an equispaced design (in terms of minimax global convergence rates)
when it is homogeneous enough since the estimator is ""borrowing strength"" in
the areas where f is adequately sampled.

The magnetic Co3Fe sublattice consists of a tetrahedral network containing

frustration effects for magnetic ordering, which were investigated by
magnetization measurements, M\""ossbauer spectroscopy, polarized neutron
diffraction, and neutron spectroscopy. Magnetization measurement and neutron
diffraction do not show long range ordering even at low temperature (1 K)
although a strong antiferromagnetic coupling (~2000 K) is deduced from the
magnetic susceptibility. Below 590 K, we observe two features, a spontaneous
weak anisotropic magnetization hysteresis along the polar crystallographic axis
and a hyperfine field on the Fe kagome sites, whereas the Fe spins on the
interlayer sites remain idle. Below ~50 K, the onset of a hyperfine field shows
the development of moments static on the M\""ossbauer time scale also for the Fe
interlayer sites. Simultaneously, an increase of spin correlations is found by
polarized neutron diffraction. The relaxation part of the dynamic response has
been further investigated by high-resolution neutron spectroscopy, which
reveals that the spin correlations start to freeze in below ~50 K. Monte Carlo
simulations show that the neutron scattering results at lower temperatures are
compatible with a recent proposal that the particular geometric frustration in

at two levels, from sender to receiver and then from receiver to sender.
Moreover, a logic circuit is used to combine the bits hence to reduce the
probability of eavesdropping. The key obtained can be used to exchange the

this pattern syntax is generally applicable to multirelational data, while it
reduces to well-known tiles [7] when the data is a simple binary or

image. We demonstrate, using the Betatron x-ray radiation produced when
electrons are accelerated and wiggled in the laser-wakefield cavity, that a
high quality phase contrast image of a complex object (here, a bee), located in
air, can be obtained with a single laser shot. The Betatron x-ray source used
in this proof of principle experiment has a source diameter of 1.7 microns and
produces a synchrotron spectrum with critical energy E_c=12.3 +- 2.5 keV and
10^9 photons per shot in the whole spectrum.

massive star formation. The effect of variable initial rotational and magnetic
energies on the formation of massive stars is studied in detail. We focus on
accretion rates and on the question under which conditions massive Keplerian
disks can form in the very early evolutionary stage of massive protostars. For
this purpose, we perform 12 simulations with different initial conditions
extending over a wide range in parameter space. The equations of
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are solved under the assumption of ideal MHD. We
find that the formation of Keplerian disks in the very early stages is
suppressed for a mass-to-flux ratio normalised to the critical value \mu below
10, in agreement with a series of low-mass star formation simulations. This is
caused by very efficient magnetic braking resulting in a nearly instantaneous
removal of angular momentum from the disk. For weak magnetic fields,
corresponding to \mu > 10, large-scale, centrifugally supported disks build up
with radii exceeding 100 AU. A stability analysis reveals that the disks are
supported against gravitationally induced perturbations by the magnetic field
and tend to form single stars rather than multiple objects. We find
protostellar accretion rates of the order of a few 10^-4 M_\sun yr^-1 which,
considering the large range covered by the initial conditions, vary only by a
factor of ~ 3 between the different simulations. We attribute this fact to two
competing effects of magnetic fields. On the one hand, magnetic braking
enhances accretion by removing angular momentum from the disk thus lowering the
centrifugal support against gravity. On the other hand, the combined effect of
magnetic pressure and magnetic tension counteracts gravity by exerting an
outward directed force on the gas in the disk thus reducing the accretion onto
the protostars.

algorithms that constitute a more principled approach to black-box optimization
than established evolutionary algorithms. NES maintains a parameterized
distribution on the set of solution candidates, and the natural gradient is
used to update the distribution's parameters in the direction of higher
expected fitness. We introduce a collection of techniques that address issues
of convergence, robustness, sample complexity, computational complexity and
sensitivity to hyperparameters. This paper explores a number of implementations
of the NES family, ranging from general-purpose multi-variate normal
distributions to heavy-tailed and separable distributions tailored towards
global optimization and search in high dimensional spaces, respectively.
Experimental results show best published performance on various standard
benchmarks, as well as competitive performance on others.

between quantum mutual information and classical correlation in a bipartite
system. It has been discussed so far for small systems with only a few
independent parameters. We extend here to a much broader class of states when
the second party is of arbitrary dimension d, so long as the first, measured,
party is a qubit. We present two formulae to calculate quantum discord, the
first relating to the original entropic definition and the second to a recently
proposed geometric distance measure which leads to an analytical formulation.
The tracing over the qubit in the entropic calculation is reduced to a very
simple prescription. And, when the d-dimensional system is a so-called X state,
the density matrix having non-zero elements only along the diagonal and
anti-diagonal so as to appear visually like the letter X, the entropic
calculation can be carried out analytically. Such states of the full bipartite
qubit-qudit system may be named ""extended X states"", whose density matrix is
built of four block matrices, each visually appearing as an X. The optimization
involved in the entropic calculation is generally over two parameters, reducing
to one for many cases, and avoided altogether for an overwhelmingly large set
of density matrices as our numerical investigations demonstrate. Our results
also apply to states of a N-qubit system, where ""extended X states"" consist of
(2^(N+2) - 1) states, larger in number than the (2^(N+1) - 1) of X states of N
qubits. While these are still smaller than the total number (2^(2N) - 1) of
states of N qubits, the number of parameters involved is nevertheless large. In
the case of N = 2, they encompass the entire 15-dimensional parameter space,
that is, the extended X states for N = 2 represent the full qubit-qubit system.

In
this paper we present an algorithm, called conauto-1.2, that efficiently tests
whether two graphs are isomorphic, and finds an isomorphism if they are. This
algorithm is an improved version of the algorithm conauto, which has been shown
to be very fast for random graphs and several families of hard graphs. In this
paper we establish a new theorem that allows, at very low cost, the easy
discovery of many automorphisms. This result is especially suited for graphs
with regularly connected components, and can be applied in any isomorphism
testing and canonical labeling algorithm to drastically improve its
performance. In particular, algorithm conauto-1.2 is obtained by the
application of this result to conauto. The resulting algorithm preserves all
the nice features of conauto, but drastically improves the testing of graphs
with regularly connected components. We run extensive experiments, which show
that the most popular algorithms (namely, nauty and bliss) can not compete with
conauto-1.2 for these graph families.

natural vibrational modes allows for a controlled study in which the evolution
of the surface waves with increasing forcing amplitude is detailed. Particular
attention is given to rationalizing the observed criteria for the onset of
edge-induced Faraday waves and droplet generation via surface fracture. Our
study indicates that drops may be levitated on the fluid surface, induced to
bounce on or skip across the vibrating fluid surface.
