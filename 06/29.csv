to detect change-points, that is times when the statistical properties of the
source change. Motivated by ideas of match lengths in information theory, we
introduce a novel non-parametric estimator which we call CRECHE (CRossings
Enumeration CHange Estimator). We present simulation evidence that this
estimator performs well, both for simulated sources and for real data formed by
concatenating text sources. For example, we show that we can accurately detect
the point at which a source changes from a Markov chain to an IID source with
the same stationary distribution. Our estimator requires no assumptions about
the form of the source distribution, and avoids the need to estimate its
probabilities. Further, we establish consistency of the CRECHE estimator under
a related toy model, by establishing a fluid limit and using martingale
arguments.

star (PNS) radiates neutrinos of all flavors. The absorption of electron-type
neutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the
""neutrino mechanism""). Because the heating rate is proportional to the square
of neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-type
neutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (CnuO) may in principle increase
the heating rate and drive explosions. In order to assess the potential
importance of CnuO for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundary
value problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the PNS surface (r_nu)
and the shock (r_S), including a scheme for flavor conversion via CnuO. For a
given r_nu, PNS mass (M), accretion rate (Mdot), and assumed values of the
neutrino energies from the PNS, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosity
above which accretion is impossible and explosion results. We show that CnuO
can decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only if
the flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_S and if there is no matter
suppression. The magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (M,
Mdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavor
conversion. We quantify these dependencies and find that CnuO could lower the
critical luminosity only for small M and Mdot, and large r_nu. However, for
these parameter values CnuO are suppressed due to matter effects. By
quantifying the importance of CnuO and matter suppression at the critical
neutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studies
that CnuO are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse
supernovae significantly.

to a one-dimensional waveguide that simultaneously provides channels for
spontaneous emission decay and a channel for the input photon. We have
developed a time-dependent theory that allows us to specify any input
single-photon wavepacket guided by the waveguide as initial condition, and
calculate the excitation probability of the emitter, as well as the time
evolution of the transmitted and reflected field. For single-photon wavepackets
with a gaussian spectrum and temporal shape, we obtain analytical solutions for
the dynamics of absorption, with maximum atomic excitation $\thicksim 40%$. We
furthermore propose a terminated waveguide to aid the single-photon absorption.
We find that for an emitter placed at an optimal distance from the termination,
the maximum atomic excitation due to an incident single-photon wavepacket can
exceed 70%. This high value is a direct consequence of the high spontaneous
emission $\beta$-factor for emission into the waveguide. Finally, we have also
explored whether waveguide dispersion could aid single-photon absorption by
pulse shaping. For a gaussian input wavepacket, we find that the absorption
efficiency can be improved by a further 4% by engineering the dispersion.
Efficient single-photon absorption by a single emitter has potential
applications in quantum communication and quantum computation.

flux, if the equations are non dimensionalized with respect to the diffusive
scale, the only free parameter in the problem is the size of the computational
domain. The problem of convergence then relates to the asymptotic form of the
solutions as the computational box size becomes large. By using a numerical
code with a high order of accuracy we show that the solutions become
asymptotically inde- pendent of domain size. We also show that cases with weak
magnetic flux join smoothly to the zero flux cases as the flux vanishes. These
results are consistent with the operation of a subcritical small-scale dynamo
driving the turbulence. We conclude that for this type of turbulence the
angular momentum transport is a proportional to the diffusive flux and
therefore has limited relevance in as- trophysical situations.

alloys exhibiting disorder induced metal-insulator transitions, the Anderson
model $H_{\omega}= -\Delta + V_{\omega} $ on $l^2(\bZ^d)$ has become in
mathematical physics as well as in probability theory a paradigmatic example
for the relevance of disorder effects. Here $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian
and $V_{\omega} = \{V_{\omega}(x): x \in \bZ^d\}$ is an i.i.d. random field
taking values in $\bR$. A popular model in probability theory is the parabolic
Anderson model (PAM), i.e. the discrete diffusion equation $\partial_t u(x,t)
=-H_{\omega} u(x,t)$ on $ \bZ^d \times \bR_+$, $u(x,0)=1$, where random sources
and sinks are modelled by the Anderson Hamiltonian. A characteristic property
of the solutions of (PAM) is the occurrence of intermittency peaks in the large
time limit. These intermittency peaks determine the thermodynamic observables
extensively studied in the probabilistic literature using path integral methods
and the theory of large deviations. The rigorous study of the relation between
the probabilistic approach to the parabolic Anderson model and the spectral
theory of Anderson localization is at least mathematically less developed. We
see our publication as a step in this direction. In particular we will prove an
unified approach to the transition of the statistical moments $< u(0,t) >$ and
the integrated density of states from classical to quantum regime using an
effective medium approach. As a by-product we will obtain a logarithmic
correction in the traditional Lifshitz tail setting when $V_{\omega}$ satisfies

nucleus of this galaxy hosts a dusty toroidal structure. According to this
model, the ratio between the inner and outer radius of the torus in NGC\,3281
is $R_0/R_d$ = 20, with {\bf 14} clouds in the equatorial radius with optical
depth of $\tau_{V}$ = 40\,mag. We would be looking in the direction of the

that the X-ray absorbing column density, which classifies NGC\,3281 as a

properties of the (cuspidal) spectrum and its associated automorphic forms

property is that the spectrum possesses multiplicities in the so-called new

that the spectrum does not contain any ""genuinely new"" eigenvalues, in the
sense that all eigenvalues of $\Gamma_{0}(9)$ appear in the spectrum of some

  The main theorem in this paper gives a precise decomposition of the spectrum

empty. We also prove that there exist an infinite number of eigenvalues of
$\Gamma_{0}(9)$ where the corresponding eigenspace is of dimension at least two

networks is the large dynamic range of network state. Since continuous tracking
of global network state at all nodes is practically impossible, nodes can only
acquire limited local views of the whole network to design their transmission
strategies. In this paper, we study multi-layer wireless networks and assume
that each node has only a limited knowledge, namely 1-local view, where each
S-D pair has enough information to perform optimally when other pairs do not
interfere, along with connectivity information for rest of the network. We
investigate the information-theoretic limits of communication with such limited
knowledge at the nodes. We develop a novel transmission strategy, namely Coded
Layer Scheduling, that solely relies on 1-local view at the nodes and
incorporates three different techniques: (1) per layer interference avoidance,
(2) repetition coding to allow overhearing of the interference, and (3) network
coding to allow interference neutralization. We show that our proposed scheme
can provide a significant throughput gain compared with the conventional
interference avoidance strategies. Furthermore, we show that our strategy
maximizes the achievable normalized sum-rate for some classes of networks,
hence, characterizing the normalized sum-capacity of those networks with
1-local view.

located ~2 kpc away from the galactic center, where a giant molecular
association is located at trailing side and associated star forming regions at
leading side. The spiral arm segment was resolved into a number of clouds whose
size, temperature and surface mass density are comparable to typical GMCs in
the Galaxy. Twenty-six clouds were identified from the combined data cube and
the identified clouds followed the line width-size relation of the Galactic
GMCs. The identified GMCs were divided into two categories according to whether
they are associated with star formation activity or not. Comparison between
both categories indicated that the active GMCs are more massive, have smaller
line width, and are closer to virial equilibrium compared to the quiescent
GMCs. These variations of the GMC properties suggest that dissipation of excess
kinetic energy of GMC is a required condition for the onset of massive star
formation.

monotonically decreases from 15 to 2.5 keV. We analyze the transition episodes
from this source observed with BeppoSAX and RXTE. We find that the X-ray
broad-band energy spectra of 4U~1728-34 during all spectral states can be
modeled by a combination of a thermal (black body-like) component, a
Comptonized component (which we herein denote COMPTB) and a Gaussian component.
Spectral analysis using this model evidences that the photon power-law index
Gamma is almost constant (Gamma=1.99+/-0.02) when kT_e changes from 15 to 2.5
keV during these spectral transitions. We explain this quasi-stability of the
index by the model in which the spectrum is dominated by the strong thermal
Comptonized component formed in the transition layer (TL) between the accretion
disk and neutron star surface. The index quasi-stability takes place when the
energy release in the TL is much higher than the flux coming to the TL from the
accretion disk. This intrinsic property of neutron star is fundamentally
different from that in black hole binary sources for which the index
monotonically increases during spectral transition from the low state to high
state and saturates at high values of mass accretion rate.

parabolic orbit with a star to include the effects of tides induced on the
central rotating star. Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar
rotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment
and numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied
to the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both
tides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the
orbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6
stellar radii (corresponding to periods $\sim 4-5$ days after the
circularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger
for retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich
law for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at
the age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by
circularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of
the planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital
period $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.
We find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding
to prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter
mass and $P_{obs}\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being
of order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the
effect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary
systems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a
consequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde
orbits. The results may also be applied to the problem of tidal capture of
stars in young stellar clusters.

such discriminantly separable polynomials. Our classification is based on the
study of structures of zeros of a polynomial component $P$ of a discriminant.

along with the collisional momentum exchange in the equations of motion. We
take into account the dependence of collision frequency on the density and
temperature perturbations. The cooling-heating functions are taken for both

in the fast sound speed limit. A new dispersion relation including the
different electron and ion cooling-heating functions and other effects

turbulence are presented at low magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm down to 0.01. For
Pm < 0.1, most of the energy is dissipated via Joule heat and, in agreement
with earlier results for helical large-scale dynamos, kinetic energy
dissipation is shown to diminish proportional to Pm^{1/2} down to values of
0.1. In agreement with earlier work, there is, in addition to a short Golitsyn
k^{-11/3} spectrum near the resistive scale also some evidence for a short
k^{-1} spectrum on larger scales. The rms magnetic field strength of the
small-scale dynamo is found to depend only weakly on the value of Pm and
decreases by about a factor of 2 as Pm is decreased from 1 to 0.01. The
possibility of dynamo action at Pm=0.1 in the nonlinear regime is argued to be
a consequence of a suppression of the bottleneck seen in the kinetic energy
spectrum in the absence of a dynamo and, more generally, a suppression of
kinetic energy near the dissipation wavenumber.

NGC 346 cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, using the results of a novel
self-consistent method that provides a reliable identification of pre-main
sequence (PMS) objects actively undergoing mass accretion, regardless of their
age. The 680 identified bona-fide PMS stars show a bimodal age distribution,
with two roughly equally numerous populations peaked respectively at ~1 Myr,
and ~20 Myr. We use the age and other physical properties of these PMS stars to
study how star formation has proceeded across time and space in NGC 346. We
find no correlation between the locations of young and old PMS stars, nor do we
find a correspondence between the positions of young PMS stars and those of
massive OB stars of similar age. Furthermore, the mass distribution of stars
with similar age shows large variations throughout the region. We conclude
that, while on a global scale it makes sense to talk about an initial mass
function, this concept is not meaningful for individual star-forming regions.
An interesting implication of the separation between regions where massive
stars and low-mass objects appear to form is that high-mass stars might not be
""perfect"" indicators of star formation and hence a large number of low-mass
stars formed elsewhere might have so far remained unnoticed. For certain low
surface density galaxies this way of preferential low-mass star formation may
be the predominant mechanism, with the consequence that their total mass as
derived from the luminosity may be severely underestimated and that their
evolution is not correctly understood.

characterization are reviewed. The spectral energy density parameter
$\Omega(f)$, commonly used as a quantifier of the background, is derived for an
ensemble of many identical sources emitting at different times and locations.
For such an ensemble, $\Omega(f)$ is generalized to account for the duration of
the signals and of the observation, so that one can distinguish the resolvable
and unresolvable parts of the background. The unresolvable part, often called
confusion noise or stochastic background, is made by signals that cannot be
either individually identified or subtracted out of the data. To account for
the resolvability of the background, the overlap function is introduced. This
function is a generalization of the duty cycle, which has been commonly used in
the literature, in some cases leading to incorrect results. The spectra
produced by binary systems (stellar binaries and massive black hole binaries)
are presented over the frequencies of all existing and planned detectors. A
semi-analytical formula for $\Omega(f)$ is derived in the case of stellar
binaries (containing white dwarfs, neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes).
Besides a realistic expectation of the level of background, upper and lower
limits are given, to account for the uncertainties in some astrophysical
parameters such as binary coalescence rates. One interesting result concerns
all current and planned ground-based detectors (including the Einstein
Telescope). In their frequency range, the background of binaries is resolvable
and only sporadically present. In other words, there is no stochastic
background of binaries for ground-based detectors.

strictly triangular polynomial maps over finite fields. This resulted in two
connected results:
  First, we give a generalization of $\F_p$-actions on $\F_p^n$ and their
description by ""locally iterative higher derivations"", namely $\Z$-actions on
$\F_p^n$ and show how to describe them by what we call ""$\Z$-flows"". We prove
equivalence between locally finite polynomial automorphisms (LFPEs) over finite
fields and $\Z$-flows over finite fields. We elaborate on $\Z$-flows of
strictly triangular polynomial maps.
  Second, we describe how one can efficiently evaluate iterations of triangular
polynomial permutations on $\F_p^n$ which have only one orbit. We do this by
determining the equivalence classes in the triangular permutation group of such
elements. We show how to conjugate them all to the map $z\lp z+1$ on the ring
$\Z/p^n\Z$ (which is identified with $\F_{p^n}$), making iterations trivial. An
application in the form of fast-forward functions from cryptography is given.

two filters: the F475W (Sloan g) and F850LP (Sloan z). The median effective
radius of these UCDs is r_h=13.0 pc. Two types of UCDs are identified in the
vicinity of NGC 1132, one type shares the same color and luminosity of the
brightest globular clusters and traces the onset of the mass-size relation. The
second kind of UCD is represented by the brightest UCD candidate, a M32-type
object, with an effective radius of r_h=77.1 pc, located at ~6.6 kpc from the
nucleus of NGC 1132. This UCD candidate is likely the remaining nucleus of a
minor merger with the host galaxy. With the exception of a particularly blue
UCD candidate, UCDs are found to extend the mass-metallicity relation found in
globular clusters to higher luminosities. The results of this work support the
growing body of evidence showing that UCDs are not circumscribed to galaxy
clusters as previously thought. UCDs are likely to be a common occurrence in
all environments. The milder tidal field of a fossil group, when compared to a

constrain the physics of dark matter and dark energy using weak gravitational
lensing and other methods. Lossy compression of the resultant data will improve
the cost and feasibility of transmitting the images through the space
communication network. We evaluate the consequences of the lossy compression
algorithm of Bernstein et al. (2010) for the high-precision measurement of
weak-lensing galaxy ellipticities. This square-root algorithm compresses each
pixel independently, and the information discarded is by construction less than
the Poisson error from photon shot noise. For simulated space-based images
(without cosmic rays) digitized to the typical 16 bits per pixel, application
of the lossy compression followed by image-wise lossless compression yields
images with only 2.4 bits per pixel, a factor of 6.7 compression. We
demonstrate that this compression introduces no bias in the sky background. The
compression introduces a small amount of additional digitization noise to the
images, and we demonstrate a corresponding small increase in ellipticity
measurement noise. The ellipticity measurement method is biased by the addition
of noise, so the additional digitization noise is expected to induce a
multiplicative bias on the galaxies' measured ellipticities. After correcting
for this known noise-induced bias, we find a residual multiplicative
ellipticity bias of m ~ -4x10^{-4}. This bias is small when compared to the
many other issues that precision weak lensing surveys must confront, and
furthermore we expect it to be reduced further with better calibration of
ellipticity measurement methods.

masses of the components. ESO/VLT observations of the donor utilising the NIR
spectrograph ISAAC were obtained in the H and K bands. The multi-epoch H band
spectra were cross-correlated with RV templates in order to determine a radial
solution for the system. The spectral type of the donor was confirmed as B0-1
I. The radial velocity curve constructed has a semi-amplitude of $23.8 \pm 3.1$
km s$^{-1}$. Combined with other measured system parameters, a dynamically
determined neutron star mass of 1.4 $\pm$ 0.2 - 1.6 $\pm$ 0.3 M$_{\odot}$ is
found. The mass range of the B0-B1 I donor was 18.6 $\pm$ 0.8 - 21.8 $\pm$ 2.4
~M$_{\odot}$. These lower and upper limits were obtained under the assumption
that the system is viewed edge-on (i = 90$^\circ$ with $\beta$ = 0.89) for the
lower limit and the donor fills its Roche lobe ($\beta = 1$ with i =
73.1$^\circ$) for the upper limit respectively.

capacity and coverage. Up until now, little basic research has been done on the
fundamentals of managing so much infrastructure -- much of it unplanned --
together with the carefully planned macro-cellular network. Inter-cell
coordination is in principle an effective way of ensuring different
infrastructure components behave in a way that increases, rather than
decreases, the key quality of service (QoS) metrics. The success of such
coordination depends heavily on how the overhead is shared, and the rate and
delay of the overhead sharing. We develop a novel framework to quantify
overhead signaling for inter-cell coordination, which is usually ignored in
traditional 1-tier networks, and assumes even more importance in multi-tier
heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). We derive the overhead quality contour
for general K-tier HCNs -- the achievable set of overhead packet rate, size,
delay and outage probability -- in closed-form expressions or computable
integrals under general assumptions on overhead arrivals and different overhead
signaling methods (backhaul and/or wireless). The overhead quality contour is
further simplified for two widely used models of overhead arrivals: Poisson and
deterministic arrival process. This framework can be used in the design and
evaluation of any inter-cell coordination scheme. It also provides design
insights on backhaul and wireless overhead channels to handle specific overhead
signaling requirements.

have to be recovered. A natural question in this setting is whether one can use
the sharing to further decrease the overall number of samples required. A line
of recent research has studied the use of \ell_1/\ell_q norm
block-regularizations with q>1 for such problems; however these could actually
perform worse in sample complexity -- vis a vis solving each problem separately
ignoring sharing -- depending on the level of sharing.
  We present a new method for multiple sparse linear regression that can
leverage support and parameter overlap when it exists, but not pay a penalty

empirically, our method strictly and noticeably outperforms both \ell_1 or

found a region in the parameter space of $U$-$E^f$ where the impurity is in the

between the bath electron and the magnetic impurity. Here $U$ is the onsite
Coulomb repulsion of the impurity electrons and $E^f$ the impurity energy

$U$ reduces double occupation and favors local moment formation, a deeper
impurity level prefers double occupation and a nonzero hybridization and thus a
Kondo screened state. For a fixed $U$, by continuously lowering the impurity

control on the evaluation of the sum capacity of finite dimensional Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems for binary and finite nonbinary inputs
and signature matrices. Important results of this paper are that the knowledge
of the received power variations due to input power differences, fading and/or
near-far effects can significantly improve the sum capacity. Also traditional
power controls can not improve the sum capacity; for the asymptotic case, any
type of power control on the near-far effects is equivalent to the case without
any power control. Moreover, for the asymptotic case, we have developed a
method that determines bounds for the fading/near-far sum capacity with
imperfect power estimation from the actual sum capacity of a CDMA system with
perfect power estimation. To show the power and utility of the results, a
number of sum capacity bounds for special cases are numerically evaluated.

small t' in the vicinity of half-filling the ferromagnetic phase region is

stabilized at moderate Hubbard U due to substantial curvature of the Fermi

transformations T: X x D --> X where X is the state-space and D is some set
which may or may not be a subset of X. We refer to our new methodology as
Transformation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC). One of the remarkable
advantages of our proposal is that even if the underlying target distribution
is very high-dimensional, deterministic transformation of a one-dimensional
random variable is sufficient to generate an appropriate Markov chain that is
guaranteed to converge to the high-dimensional target distribution. Apart from
clearly leading to massive computational savings, this idea of
deterministically transforming a single random variable very generally leads to
excellent acceptance rates, even though all the random variables associated
with the high-dimensional target distribution are updated in a single block.
Since it is well-known that joint updating of many random variables using
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm generally leads to poor acceptance rates,
TMCMC, in this regard, seems to provide a significant advance. We validate our
proposal theoretically, establishing the convergence properties. Furthermore,
we show that TMCMC can be very effectively adopted for simulating from doubly
intractable distributions.
  TMCMC is compared with MH using the well-known Challenger data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of of the former in the case of highly correlated variables.
Moreover, we apply our methodology to a challenging posterior simulation
problem associated with the geostatistical model of Diggle et al. (1998),
updating 160 unknown parameters jointly, using a deterministic transformation
of a one-dimensional random variable. Remarkable computational savings as well
as good convergence properties and acceptance rates are the results.

The energy consumption rate adopted for the HH model yields a {\it negative}

(1) The UV brightness minimum was much deeper in 2009. This suggests that
physical conditions in the early stages of an event depend on different
parameters than the ""normal"" inter-event wind. Extra mass ejection from the
primary star is one possible cause. (2) The expected He II 4687 brightness
maximum was followed several weeks later by another. We explain why this fact,
and the timing of the 4687 maxima, strongly support a ""shock breakup""
hypothesis for X-ray and 4687 behavior as proposed 5-10 years ago. (3) We
observed a polar view of the star via light reflected by dust in the Homunculus
nebula. Surprisingly, at that location the variations of emission-line
brightness and Doppler velocities closely resembled a direct view of the star;
which should not have been true for any phenomena related to the orbit. This
result casts very serious doubt on all the proposed velocity interpretations

variations of H I, He I and Fe II features reveal aspects of wind behavior
during the event. In addition, we discuss implications of the observations for
several crucial unsolved problems.

the gas-phase CO abundance in the mid-plane of protoplanetary disks. The light
molecule H2D+,is a tracer of cold and CO-depleted environment. It is therefore
a good candidate to explore the disks mid-planes. We performed a deep search
for H2D+ in the two well-known disks surrounding TW Hya and DM Tau using the
APEX and JCMT telescopes. The analysis of the observations are done with
DISKFIT, a radiative transfer code dedicated to disks. In addition, we used a
chemical model describing deuterium chemistry to infer the implications of our
observations on the level of CO depletion and on the ionization rate in the
disks mid-plane. The ortho-H2D+(1(1,0))-1(1,1)) line at 372 GHz was not
detected. Although our limit is three times better than previous observations,
comparison with the chemical modeling indicates that it remains insufficient to
put valuable constraints on the CO abundance in the disk mid-plane. Even with
ALMA, the detection of H2D+ may not be straightforward, and H2D+ may not be a
sufficiently sensitive tracer of the protoplanetary disks mid-plane

represented using subset bounds. However, this is a weak representation that
neglects potentially useful information about a set such as its cardinality.
For set variables, the length-lex (LL) representation successfully provides
information about the length (cardinality) and position in the lexicographic
ordering. For multiset variables, where elements can be repeated, we consider
richer representations that take into account additional information. We study
eight different representations in which we maintain bounds according to one of
the eight different orderings: length-(co)lex (LL/LC), variety-(co)lex (VL/VC),
length-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC), and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC)
orderings. These representations integrate together information about the
cardinality, variety (number of distinct elements in the multiset), and
position in some total ordering. Theoretical and empirical comparisons of
expressiveness and compactness of the eight representations suggest that
length-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC) and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC) usually
give tighter bounds after constraint propagation. We implement the eight
representations and evaluate them against the subset bounds representation with
cardinality and variety reasoning. Results demonstrate that they offer
significantly better pruning and runtime.

the masses of black holes cannot assume continuous values and must be
quantized. Our proof solely relies on Poincare-invariance of the asymptotic
background, and is insensitive to geometric characteristics of black holes or
other peculiarities of the short distance physics. Therefore, our results are
equally-applicable to any other localized objects on asymptotically
Poincare-invariant space, such as classicalons. By adding a requirement that in
large mass limit the quantization must approximately account for classical
results, we derive an universal quantization rule applicable to all
classicalons (including black holes) in arbitrary number of dimensions. In
particular, this implies, that black holes cannot emit/absorb arbitrarily soft
quanta. The effect has phenomenological model-independent implications for
black holes and other classicalons that may be created at LHC. We predict, that
contrary to naive intuition, the black holes and/or classicalons, will be
produced in form of fully-fledged quantum resonances of discrete masses, with
the level-spacing controlled by the inverse square-root of cross-section.

provides confidence in both methods for producing reliable results. The 11.0

directed networks by manipulating a fixed number of links. We proposed a
centrality-based reconstructing (CBR) method, where the node centrality is
measured by the well-known PageRank algorithm. Extensive numerical simulation
on many modeled networks demonstrated that the CBR method is more effective in
facilitating synchronization than the degree-based reconstructing method and
random reconstructing method for adding or removing links. The reason is that
CBR method can effectively narrow the incoming degree distribution and
reinforce the hierarchical structure of the network. Furthermore, we apply the
CBR method to links rewiring procedure where at each step one link is removed
and one new link is added. The CBR method helps to decide which links should be
removed or added. After several steps, the resulted networks are very close to
the optimal structure from the evolutionary optimization algorithm. The
numerical simulations on the Kuramoto model further demonstrate that our method
has advantage in shortening the convergence time to synchronization on directed
networks.

operations is often limited by communication overhead. Starting from the
observation that nonblocking MPI is not able to hide communication cost using
standard MPI implementations, we demonstrate that explicit overlap of
communication and computation can be achieved by using a dedicated
communication thread, which may run on a virtual core. Moreover we identify
performance benefits of hybrid MPI/OpenMP programming due to improved load
balancing even without explicit communication overlap. We compare performance
results for pure MPI, the widely used ""vector-like"" hybrid programming

theorem we show that the Renyi entropy selectively emphasizes only certain
sectors of the underlying empirical distribution while strongly suppressing
others. This accentuation is controlled with Renyi's parameter q. To tackle the
issue of the information flow between time series we formulate the concept of
Renyi's transfer entropy as a measure of information that is transferred only
between certain parts of underlying distributions. This is particularly
pertinent in financial time series where the knowledge of marginal events such
as spikes or sudden jumps is of a crucial importance. We apply the Renyian
information flow to stock market time series from 11 world stock indices as
sampled at a daily rate in the time period 02.01.1990 - 31.12.2009.

flow between world markets is strongly asymmetric with a distinct information
surplus flowing from the Asia-Pacific region to both European and US markets.
An important yet less dramatic excess of information also flows from Europe to
the US. This is particularly clearly seen from a careful analysis of Renyi

compare the performance of some well-known models with our intuition model. The
aim of the experiment was to predict the maximum accurate answers using
intuition based models. We found that the presence of unknown entities,
diversion from the current problem scenario, and identifying weakness without
the normal logic based execution, greatly affects the reliability of the
answers. Generally, the intuition based models cannot be a substitute for the
logic based mechanisms in handling such problems. The intuition can only act as
a support for an ongoing logic based model that processes all the steps in a
sequential manner. However, when time and computational cost are very strict
constraints, this intuition based model becomes extremely important and useful,
because it can give a reasonably good performance. Factors affecting intuition

The optical and radio properties of the LLC sample are in general consistent

temperatures, molecules are mutually caged by the intermolecular potential. The
fluctuation and dissipation from motion of caged molecules when observed by
elastic incoherent neutron scattering exhibit a change in temperature
dependence of the mean square displacement (MSD) at the glass transition
temperature Tg. This is a general and fundamental property of caged dynamics in
glassformers, which is observed always near Tg independent of the energy
resolution of the spectrometer. Recently we showed the same change of
T-dependence at Tg is present in proteins solvated with bioprotectants,
coexisting with the dynamic transition at a higher temperature Td. In these
solvated proteins, all having Tg and Td higher than the proteins hydrated by
water alone, the observation of the change of T-dependence of the MSD at Tg is
unobstructed by the methyl-group rotation contribution at lower temperatures.
On the other hand, proteins hydrated by water alone have lower Tg and Td, and
hence unambiguous evidence of the transition of MSD at Tg is hard to find.
Notwithstanding, evidence on the break of the MSD at Tg can be found by
deuterating the protein to suppress the methyl-group contribution. An
alternative strategy is the use of a spectrometer that senses motions faster
than 15 ps, which confers the benefit of shifting both the onset of
methyl-group rotation contribution as well as the dynamic transition to higher
temperatures, and again the change of MSD at Tg becomes evident. The break of
the elastic intensity or the MSD at Tg coexists with the dynamics transition at
Td in hydrated and solvated proteins. Recognition of this fact helps to remove
inconsistency and conundrum encountered in interpreting the data that thwart
progress in understanding the origin of the dynamic transition and its
connection to biological function.

to improve and generalize existing magnetosphere models. We want to build more
general configurations of twisted, force-free magnetospheres as a first step to
understanding the role played by the magnetic field geometry in the observed

viability and limitations of semi-analytical approaches. Second, we built a
numerical code able to relax an initial configuration of a nonrotating
magnetosphere to a force-free geometry, provided any arbitrary form of the
magnetic field at the star surface. The numerical code is based on a
finite-difference time-domain, divergence-free, and conservative scheme, based
of the magneto-frictional method used in other scenarios. We obtain new
numerical configurations of twisted magnetospheres, with distributions of twist
and currents that differ from previous analytical solutions. The range of
global twist of the new family of solutions is similar to the existing
semi-analytical models (up to some radians), but the achieved geometry may be
quite different. The geometry of twisted, force-free magnetospheres shows a
wider variety of possibilities than previously considered. This has
implications for the observed spectra and opens the possibility of implementing

number range, from laminar regime at $Re = 10^{2}$ to highly turbulent regime
near $Re = 10^{6}$. We show that the flow symmetry can be quantitatively
characterized by two scalars, the global angular momentum $I$ and the mixing
layer altitude $z_s$, which are shown to be statistically equivalent.
Furthermore, we report that the flow response to small forcing dissymetry is
linear, with a slope depending on the Reynolds number: this response
coefficient increases non monotonically from small to large Reynolds number and
presents a divergence at a critical Reynolds number $Re_c = 40\,000 \pm
5\,000$. This divergence coincides with a change in the statistical properties
of the instantaneous flow symmetry $I(t)$: its pdf changes from Gaussian to
non-Gaussian with multiple maxima, revealing metastable non-symmetrical states.
For symmetric forcing, a peak of fluctuations of $I(t)$ is also observed at
$Re_c$: these fluctuations correspond to time-intermittencies between
metastable states of the flow which, contrary to the very-long-time-averaged
mean flow, spontaneously and dynamically break the system symmetry. We show
that these observations can be interpreted in terms of divergence of the
susceptibility to symmetry breaking, revealing the existence of a phase
transition. An analogy with the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in

by ""splitting"" the Hamiltonian in a way that allows much of the movement around
the state space to be done at low computational cost. One context where this is
possible is when the log density of the distribution of interest (the potential
energy function) can be written as the log of a Gaussian density, which is a
quadratic function, plus a slowly varying function. Hamiltonian dynamics for
quadratic energy functions can be analytically solved. With the splitting
technique, only the slowly-varying part of the energy needs to be handled
numerically, and this can be done with a larger stepsize (and hence fewer
steps) than would be necessary with a direct simulation of the dynamics.
Another context where splitting helps is when the most important terms of the
potential energy function and its gradient can be evaluated quickly, with only
a slowly-varying part requiring costly computations. With splitting, the quick
portion can be handled with a small stepsize, while the costly portion uses a
larger stepsize. We show that both of these splitting approaches can reduce the
computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution for a logistic
regression model, using either a Gaussian approximation centered on the
posterior mode, or a Hamiltonian split into a term that depends on only a small
number of critical cases, and another term that involves the larger number of
cases whose influence on the posterior distribution is small. Supplemental

cavity-coupled-Cooper pair transistor (CPT) system, where an applied dc bias
causes the system to self-oscillate via the ac Josephson effect. Varying the dc
bias allows the self-oscillation frequency to be tuned. An unusual feature of
the system design is that the dc bias does not significantly affect the high
quality factor of the cavity mode to which the CPT predominantly couples. The
CPT-cavity mode system has a mechanical analogue involving a driven coupled
pendulum-oscillator system. The corresponding, nonlinear classical dynamical
equations exhibit chaotic, as well as aperiodic motions depending on the
initial conditions and the nature and strengths of the damping/noise forces.
The quantum master equation exhibits such phenomena as dynamical tunneling and
the generation of non-classical states from initial classical states. Obviating
the need for an external ac-drive line, which typically is harder to noise
filter than a dc bias line, the self-oscillating system described here has

a deeper study of the properties of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) and, in

interested on the time evolution of perturbations in the baryon and energy
densities. If a localized pulse in baryon density could propagate throughout
the QGP for long distances preserving its shape and without loosing
localization, this could have interesting consequences for relativistic heavy
ion physics and for astrophysics. A mathematical way to proove that this can
happen is to derive (under certain conditions) from the hydrodynamical
equations of the QGP a Korteveg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The solution of this
equation describes the propagation of a KdV soliton. The derivation of the KdV
equation depends crucially on the equation of state (EOS) of the QGP. The use
of the simple MIT bag model EOS does not lead to KdV solitons. Recently we have
developed an EOS for the QGP which includes both perturbative and
non-perturbative corrections to the MIT one and is still simple enough to allow
for analitycal manipulations. With this EOS we were able to derive a KdV
equation for the cold QGP.

many-body states in the presence of an external electric field, manifesting
itself as the creation of electron-positron pairs (Schwinger effect). This
effect has been a long-standing but still unobserved prediction as the
generation of the required field strengths has not been feasible so far.
However, due to the advent of a new generation of high-intensity laser systems
such as the European XFEL or the Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI), this
effect might eventually become observable within the next decades. Based on the
equal-time Wigner formalism, various aspects of the Schwinger effect in

Regarding the Schwinger effect in time-dependent electric fields, analytic
expressions for the equal-time Wigner function in the presence of a static as
well as a pulsed electric field are derived. Moreover, the pair creation
process in the presence of a pulsed electric field with sub-cycle structure,
which acts as a model for a realistic laser pulse, is examined. Finally, an ab

scheme for the generation of nondegenerate, copolarised, modal, and path-
entangled photons using a directional coupler and an asymmetric Y-coupler
geometry in type 0 phase-matched domain engineered lithium niobate(LN)
waveguide. The nonlinearity in LN is tailored in such a way that quasi phase
matching conditions for two different spontaneous parametric down conversion
processes are obeyed simultaneously, leading to a modal and path-entangled
state at the output. Assuming typical values of various parameters, we show,
through numerical simulations, that an almost maximally entangled state is
achievable over a wide range of waveguide parameters. For the degenerate case,
the scheme gives a NOON state for N = 2. The generated entangled photon pairs
should have potential applications in quantum information schemes and also in
quantum metrology. By appropriate domain engineering and component designing,
the idea can be further extended to generate hyperentangled and two-photon

a confined plasma ejection that was observed in a numerical experiment of the
solar corona. By quantifying physical parameters such as mass, velocity, and
orientation of the plasma ejection relative to the magnetic field, we provide a
description of the nature of this particular phenomenon. The time-dependent
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) equations are solved in a box
extending from the chromosphere to the lower corona. The plasma is heated by
currents that are induced through field line braiding as a consequence of
photospheric motions. Spectra of optically thin emission lines in the extreme
ultraviolet range are synthesized, and magnetic field lines are traced over
time. Following strong heating just above the chromosphere, the pressure
rapidly increases, leading to a hydrodynamic explosion above the upper
chromosphere in the low transition region. The explosion drives the plasma,
which needs to follow the magnetic field lines. The ejection is then moving
more or less ballistically along the loop-like field lines and eventually drops
down onto the surface of the Sun. The speed of the ejection is in the range of
the sound speed, well below the Alfven velocity. The plasma ejection is
basically a hydrodynamic phenomenon, whereas the rise of the heating rate is of
magnetic nature. The granular motions in the photosphere lead (by chance) to a
strong braiding of the magnetic field lines at the location of the explosion
that in turn is causing strong currents which are dissipated. Future studies
need to determine if this process is a ubiquitous phenomenon on the Sun on
small scales. Data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (AIA/SDO) might provide the relevant information.

NGC 376 an age of 28+/-7 Myr, in good agreement with previous studies. The high
spatial resolution ACS data allow us to determine the center of gravity of the
cluster and to construct extended surface brightness and radial density
profiles. Neither of these profiles can be fitted with a theoretical model,
suggesting that the cluster is not in virial equilibrium. Considering the young
age of the cluster, we speculate that the distortion of the radial profiles may
be the result of the rapid gas dispersal that follows the initial phase of star
formation. The cluster shows clear evidence of dynamical mass segregation. From
the properties of the radial profiles and the present day mass function (PDMF)
we conclude that NGC 376 appears to have already lost nearly 90% of its initial
stellar mass, probably as a consequence of the sudden gas dispersal that
follows the early phase of star formation (SF).

by the operator {L-\mu,B} of an elliptic boundary value problem in G, where L
is a matrix differential operator, B is a boundary operator, and \mu is a
spectral parameter. The operator {L,B} is self-adjoint with respect to a Green
formula. The role of L can be played, e.g., by the Helmholtz operator, by the
operators in elasticity theory and hydrodynamics. As approximation for a row of
the scattering matrix S(\mu), we take the minimizer of a quadratic functional.
To construct the functional, we solve an auxiliary boundary value problem in
the bounded domain obtained by truncating the cylindrical ends of the waveguide
at distance R. As R tends to indinity, the minimizer a(R,\mu) tends with
exponential rate to the corresponding row of the scattering matrix uniformly on
every finite closed interval of the continuous spectrum not containing the

eigenfunctions exponentially decaying at infinity (""trapped modes"").
Eigenvalues of this sort, as a rule, occur in waveguides of complicated

the method.

known to have a mildly asymmetric HI profile (A_flux =1.23 {\pm}0.3). Our EVLA
observations show there is ~ 12% more HI projected South of the optical centre
(approaching velocities) than in the North (receding velocities), despite the
HI extending ~ 16% further to the North than the South. The HI projected within
the optical disk must have been perturbed within the HI relaxation time (~ 10^8
yr) which implies that this can not have been caused by any of the three
nearest companions, as their distance (~ 0.5Mpc) is too large. Neither HI-rich
companions nor tidal tails were found within our field of view and velocity
range covered. Our kinematical data suggest that the inner part harbors an oval
distortion whereas the outer regions show signs of a modest warp. The mild
asymmetry in the HI global profile thus actually masks stronger asymmetries in
the two-dimensional distributions of gas and star forming regions in this
galaxy. Since the galaxy is isolated, this must predominantly be due to
processes related to its formation and secular evolution.

contamination from either Lyman-$\alpha$ emission or the Lyman-$\alpha$ break.
In this work we use Near-IR imaging to measure the rest-frame UV continuum
colours of galaxies at $4.7<z<7.7$. We are have carefully defined a
colour-colour selection to minimise any inherent bias in the measured UV
continuum slope for the drop-out samples. For the highest-redshift sample
($6.7<z<7.7$), selected as $z_{f850lp}$-band dropouts, we find mean UV
continuum colours approximately equal to zero (AB), consistent with a
dust-free, solar metallicity, star forming population (or a moderately dusty
population of low metallicity). At lower-redshift we find that the mean UV
continuum colours of galaxies (over the same luminosity range) are redder, and
that galaxies with higher luminosities are also slightly redder on average. One
interpretation of this is that lower-redshift and more luminous galaxies are
dustier, however this interpretation is complicated by the effects of the star
formation history and metallicity and potentially the initial mass function on
the UV continuum colours.

aqueous mixtures with glass transition temperature Tg approaching the putative
Tg=136 K of water from above and below, (2) in confined spaces of nanometer in
size and (3) in the bulk at temperatures above the homogeneous nucleation
temperature. Altogether, the considered relaxation times from the data range
nearly over 15 decades from 10-12 to 103 s. Assisted by the various features in
the isothermal spectra and theoretical interpretation, these considerations
enable us to conclude that relaxation of un-crystallized water is highly
non-cooperative. The exponent Beta_K of its Kohlrausch stretched exponential
correlation function is not far from having the value of one, and hence the
deviation from exponential time decay is slight. Albeit the temperature
dependence of its alpha-relaxation time being non-Arrhenius, the corresponding
Tg-scaled temperature dependence has small steepness index m, likely less than
44 at Tg, and hence water is not 'fragile' as a glassformer. The separation in
time scale of the alpha- and the beta-relaxations is small at Tg, becomes
smaller at higher temperatures, and they merge together shortly above Tg. From
all these properties and by inference, water is highly non-cooperative as a
glass-former, it has short cooperative length-scale, and possibly minimal
configurational entropy and small change of heat capacity at Tg compared with
other organic glass-formers. This conclusion is perhaps unsurprising because
water is the smallest molecule. Our deductions from the data rule out that the
Tg of water is higher than 160 K, and suggest that it is close to the
traditional value of 136 K.

for processing moving nearest neighbor queries on uncertain data, namely the
probabilistic moving nearest neighbor (PMNN) queries. A PMNN query finds the
most probable nearest neighbor of a moving query point continuously. To process
PMNN queries efficiently, we provide two techniques: a pre-computation approach
and an incremental approach. In the pre-computation approach, we develop an
algorithm to efficiently evaluate PMNN queries based on the pre-computed PVD
for the entire data set. In the incremental approach, we propose an incremental
probabilistic safe region based technique that does not require to pre-compute
the whole PVD to answer the PMNN query. In this incremental approach, we
exploit the knowledge for a known region to compute the lower bound of the
probability of an object being the nearest neighbor. Experimental results show
that our approaches significantly outperform a sampling based approach by
orders of magnitude in terms of I/O, query processing time, and communication
overheads.

also reveal some biases in the radial velocities of \u{psion} Andromedae and
report updated orbital parameters for the recently proposed 4-planet model.
Because of the generality of our criterion, no assumptions are needed on the
nature of the measurements, models, or model parameters. The method we propose

other, curvature perturbations can be temporarily enhanced to a value much
larger than the observed one 10^{-5}. The traces of the enhancement may be left
as higher order correlation functions, that is, as non-Gaussianity, the
stochastic gravitational waves that are sourced by scalar-scalar mode
couplings, as well as the primordial black holes that are formed by the
gravitational collapse of the enhanced curvature perturbations. We first
confirm that such a temporal enhancement indeed occurs by solving the
linearized perturbation equations both numerically and analytically. We then
derive an analytic expression of the full-order curvature perturbation which
does not rely on the frequently used sudden decay approximation and is exact on
super-horizon scales. By using this analytic formula, we provide expressions of
the non-linearity parameters f_nl, tau_nl and g_nl. If both two curvatons
contribute to the final curvature perturbations, the strong non-Gaussianity
appears in the trispectrum rather than in the bispectrum. We also find a unique
consistency relation between tau_nl and g_nl without f_nl. By using the
second-order perturbation theory, we numerically show that the spectrum of the
induced gravitational waves has a plateau corresponding to duration of the
enhancement and such gravitational waves can be probed by ultimate-DECIGO and
space-based atomic interferometers. We finally calculate the abundance of the
primordial black holes and put a constraint on the amplitude of the enhanced
