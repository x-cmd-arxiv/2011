technologies is fast becoming intimate with high degrees of complex
interaction. It can be argued that muscular function, limb movements, and touch
perception serve supervisory functions for movement control in motion and
touch-based (e.g. manipulable) devices/interfaces and human-machine interfaces
in general. To get at this hypothesis requires the use of novel techniques and
analyses which demonstrate the multifaceted and regulatory role of adaptive
physiological processes in these interactions. Neuromechanics is an approach
that unifies the role of physiological function, motor performance, and
environmental effects in determining human performance. A neuromechanical
perspective will be used to explain the effect of environmental fluctuations on
supervisory mechanisms, which leads to adaptive physiological responses. Three
experiments are presented using two different types of virtual environment that
allowed for selective switching between two sets of environmental forces. This
switching was done in various ways to maximize the variety of results.
Electromyography (EMG) and kinematic information contributed to the development
of human performance-related measures. Both descriptive and specialized
analyses were conducted: peak amplitude analysis, loop trace analysis, and the
analysis of unmatched muscle power. Results presented here provide a window
into performance under a range of conditions. These analyses also demonstrated
myriad consequences for force-related fluctuations on dynamic physiological
regulation. The findings presented here could be applied to the dynamic control
of touch-based and movement-sensitive human-machine systems. In particular, the
design of systems such as human-robotic systems, touch screen devices, and
rehabilitative technologies could benefit from this research.

to the doping effect by metal contacts. Furthermore, at higher M-G coupling
strengths the contact DOS broadening effect increases the on-current, while the
impact on the minimum current (Imin) in the off-state depends on the source to
drain bias voltage and the work-function difference between graphene and the
contact metal. Interestingly, with scaling of the channel length, the MIS
inside the channel has a weak influence on Imin even at large M-G coupling
strengths, while direct source-to-drain (S -> D) tunneling has a stronger
influence. Therefore, channel length scalability of GFETs with sufficient gate

is larger than 50% to avoid possibly large errors in the faint end slope that

For a complex surface of general type with p_g = 0 it is equivalent to Bloch's

Kummer surface. In this paper we prove some results on Kimura's conjecture for
complex K3 surfaces. If X has a large Picard number, i.e 19 or 20, then the
motive of X is finite dimensional. If X has a non-symplectic group acting
trivially on algebraic cycles then the motive of X is finite dimensional. If X
has a symplectic involution i, i.e a Nikulin involution, then the finite
dimensionality of h(X) implies h(X) is isomorphic to h(Y), where Y is a
desingularization of the quotient surface X= X/< i >. We give several examples
of K3 surfaces with a Nikulin involution such that the above isomorphism holds,
so giving some evidence to Kimura's conjecture in this case.

regions where SNeIa were recorded. Our V and R SBF measures provide distances
in agreement with literature estimates. The median of our and literature
SBF-based distances agrees with the one from non-SBF methods. Comparing data
with models we find that stellar populations properties do not change
significantly along galactic radius, with a dominant population having old age
and solar chemical composition. The galaxies appear similar in all properties
analysed, except for B-band SBF. Since the SBF magnitudes in this band are
sensitive to the properties of a hot stellar component, we speculate that such
behaviour is a consequence of different diffuse hot components in the galaxies.
We find that the presence of a percentage of hot-HB stars in old and metal rich
stellar populations could be at the origin of the observed differences. We find
a good uniformity in the V and R SBF and integrated colours in the regions
where the three SNeIa exploded. On the other hand, the B-band SBF signal shows

intermittent phase locking in oscillatory systems. When an oscillatory system
is in a weakly synchronized regime away from a synchronization threshold, it
spends most of the time in parts of its phase space away from synchronization
state. Therefore characteristics of dynamics near this state (such as its
stability properties/Lyapunov exponents or distributions of the durations of
synchronized episodes) do not describe system's dynamics for most of the time.
We consider an approach to characterize the system dynamics in this case, by
exploring the relationship between the phases on each cycle of oscillations. If
some overall level of phase locking is present, one can quantify when and for
how long phase locking is lost, and how the system returns back to the
phase-locked state. We consider several examples to illustrate this approach:
coupled skewed tent maps, which stability can be evaluated analytically,
coupled R\""{o}ssler and Lorenz oscillators, undergoing through different
intermittencies on the way to phase synchronization, and a more complex example
of coupled neurons. We show that the obtained measures can describe the
differences in the dynamics and temporal structure of
synchronization/desynchronization events for the systems with similar overall

a version of the baby Skyrme model in which the global O(3) symmetry is broken
to the dihedral group D_N. It is found that the single soliton in this theory
is composed of N partons, that are topologically confined. The case N=3 is
studied in some detail and multi-soliton solutions are computed. These soliton
solutions are related to polyiamonds, which are plane figures composed of
equilateral triangles joined by common edges. It is shown that the solitons may
be viewed as pieces of a doubly periodic soliton lattice. An alternative model
with D_3 symmetry is also introduced, which has an exact explicit soliton
lattice solution. Soliton solutions are computed and compared in the two D_3
theories. Some comments are made regarding the extension of these ideas to the
Skyrme model.

oscillations occur in the presence of an external magnetic field, and ALPs can
lead to observable effects on the measured photon spectrum of astrophysical
sources. An intriguing situation arises when blazars are observed with the
Cherenkov Telescopes H.E.S.S., MAGIC, CANGAROO III and VERITAS. The
extragalactic background light (EBL) produced by galaxies during cosmic
evolution gives rise to a source dimming which becomes important in the VHE
band. This dimming can be considerably reduced by photon-ALP oscillations in
the large-scale magnetic fields, and the resulting blazar spectra become harder
than expected. We find that for ALPs lighter than 5 x 10^{-10} eV the photon
survival probability is larger than predicted by conventional physics above a
few hundred GeV. This is a clear-cut prediction which can be tested with the
planned Cherenkov Telescope Array and HAWC. Moreover, we offer a new
interpretation of the VHE blazars detected so far, according to which the large
spread in the values of the observed spectral index is mainly due to the wide
spread in the source distances rather than to large variations of their

blueward asymmetries of emission lines formed in the solar corona and
transition region. These asymmetries are most prominent in loop footpoint
regions, where a clear correlation of the asymmetry with the Doppler shift and
line width determined from the single Gaussian fit is found. Such asymmetries
suggest at least two emission components: a primary component accounting for
the background emission and a secondary component associated with high-speed
upflows. The latter has been proposed to play a vital role in the coronal
heating process and there is no agreement on its properties. Here we slightly
modify the initially developed technique of Red-Blue (RB) asymmetry analysis
and apply it to both artificial spectra and spectra observed by the EUV Imaging
Spectrometer onboard Hinode, and demonstrate that the secondary component
usually contributes a few percent of the total emission, has a velocity ranging
from 50 to 150 km s-1 and a Gaussian width comparable to that of the primary
one in loop footpoint regions. The results of the RB asymmetry analysis are
then used to guide a double Gaussian fit and we find that the obtained
properties of the secondary component are generally consistent with those
obtained from the RB asymmetry analysis. Through a comparison of the location,
relative intensity, and velocity distribution of the blueward secondary
component with the properties of the upward propagating disturbances revealed

rigorous way, the deep connections between correlation functions for
eigenvalues of these random matrix ensembles on the one hand and the
enumerative interpretations of their matrix moments in terms of map
combinatorics (a branch of graph theory) on the other. In doing this we make
essential use of the link between the asymptotics of the random matrix
partition function and orthogonal polynomials with exponential weight equal to
the random matrix potential. Along the way we develop and analyze the continuum

values for 55 Cnc's stellar astrophysical parameters based on improved
interferometry: $R=0.943 \pm 0.010 R_{\odot}$, $T_{\rm EFF} = 5196 \pm 24$ K.
We use isochrone fitting to determine 55 Cnc's age to be 10.2 $\pm$ 2.5 Gyr,
implying a stellar mass of $0.905 \pm 0.015 M_{\odot}$. Our analysis of the
location and extent of the system's habitable zone (0.67--1.32 AU) shows that
planet f, with period $\sim$ 260 days and $M \sin i = 0.155 M_{Jupiter}$,
spends the majority of the duration of its elliptical orbit in the
circumstellar habitable zone. Though planet f is too massive to harbor liquid
water on any planetary surface, we elaborate on the potential of alternative
low-mass objects in planet f's vicinity: a large moon, and a low-mass planet on
a dynamically stable orbit within the habitable zone. Finally, our direct value
for 55 Cancri's stellar radius allows for a model-independent calculation of
the physical diameter of the transiting super-Earth 55 Cnc e ($\sim 2.05 \pm
0.15 R_{\earth}$), which, depending on the planetary mass assumed, implies a
bulk density of 0.76 $\rho_{\earth}$ or 1.07 $\rho_{\earth}$.

investigated. It is shown that Koopmans' theorem does not apply in the

proportional to the interaction between two electrons belonging to the same
orbital. Hartree-Fock statistical theory has also been applied in the canonical
ensemble [Blenski et al., Phys. Rev. E 55, R4889 (1997)] for the purpose of
photo-absorption calculations. In that case, the Hartree-Fock
self-consistent-field equations are derived in the super-configuration
approximation. It is shown that Koopmans' theorem does not hold in the

obtained, by assuming that a particular quantity multiplying the interaction
matrix element in the expression of the energy does not change during the
removal of an electron.

work highlights the many advantages of L1 methods, in this paper we find that
L1 regularisation often dramatically underperforms in terms of predictive
performance when compared with other methods for inferring sparsity. We focus
on unsupervised latent variable models, and develop L1 minimising factor
models, Bayesian variants of ""L1"", and Bayesian models with a stronger L0-like
sparsity induced through spike-and-slab distributions. These spike-and-slab
Bayesian factor models encourage sparsity while accounting for uncertainty in a
principled manner and avoiding unnecessary shrinkage of non-zero values. We
demonstrate on a number of data sets that in practice spike-and-slab Bayesian
methods outperform L1 minimisation, even on a computational budget. We thus
highlight the need to re-assess the wide use of L1 methods in sparsity-reliant
applications, particularly when we care about generalising to previously unseen
data, and provide an alternative that, over many varying conditions, provides
improved generalisation performance.

debate is proposed, in which the principle of relativity is used to uniquely
determine the light momentum formulation for a plane wave in a moving
non-dispersive lossless isotropic uniform medium. It is shown by analysis of
the plane-wave solution that, (1) there may be a pseudo-power flow when a
medium moves, and the Poynting vector does not necessarily denote the direction
of real power flowing, (2) Minkowski's light momentum and energy constitute a
Lorentz four-vector in a form of single photon or single EM-field cell, and
Planck constant is a Lorentz invariant, (3) there is no momentum transfer
taking place between the plane wave and the uniform medium, and the EM momentum
conservation equation cannot be uniquely determined without resort to the
principle of relativity, and (4) the moving medium behaves as a so-called
""negative index medium"" when it moves opposite to the wave vector at a
faster-than-dielectric light speed. It is also shown by analysis of EM-field
Lorentz transformations that, when a static electric (magnetic) field moves in
free space, neither Abraham's nor Minkowski's formulation can correctly
describe a real electromagnetic momentum; as an application of this principle,
the classical electron mass-energy paradox is analyzed and resolved. Finally, a
general EM momentum definition is proposed, and according to this new
definition, the traditional ""Abraham-type"" and ""Minkowski-type"" momentums in
the dispersion wave-guiding systems, such as regular dielectric-filled metallic
waveguides, are found to be included in the same momentum formulation, but they
appear at different frequencies.

eventual, large-scale in-ice UHE neutrino detector. Herein, we present updated
limits on the diffuse UHE neutrino flux, based on twelve years of data taken
between 1999 and 2010. We find no convincing neutrino candidates, resulting in
95% confidence-level model-dependent limits on the flux which improve on our
previous (2006) results by a factor of two. We also report on ice properties'
studies, including observation of radiowave reflections from layers internal to
the ice sheet. We observe correlations of these reflections with the local ice
flow direction, and also qualitatively verify the expected reduction in radio
frequency ice transparency with increasing depth/temperature. A new
experimental initiative (the Askaryan Radio Array, ARA) commenced at South Pole
in 2010-11 will improve the RICE sensitivity (per unit time) by approximately
two orders of magnitude.

determined, we study two models: the Tight-Winding Approximation (TWA) model,
which represents a local approximation, and a model with self-consistent
material arms named PERLAS. This is a mass distribution with more abrupt
gravitational forces. We perform test particle simulations after tuning the two
models to the observational range for the MW spiral arm properties. We explore
the effects of the arm properties and find that a significant region of the
allowed parameter space favours the appearance of kinematic groups. The
velocity distribution is mostly sensitive to the relative spiral arm phase and
pattern speed. In all cases the arms induce strong kinematic imprints for
pattern speeds around 17 km/s/kpc (close to the 4:1 inner resonance) but no
substructure is induced close to corotation. The groups change significantly if
one moves only ~0.6 kpc in galactocentric radius, but ~2 kpc in azimuth. The
appearance time of each group is different, ranging from 0 to more than 1 Gyr.
Recent spiral arms can produce strong kinematic structures. The stellar
response to the two potential models is significantly different near the Sun,
both in density and kinematics. The PERLAS model triggers more substructure for
a larger range of pattern speed values. The kinematic groups can be used to
reduce the current uncertainty about the MW spiral structure and to test
whether this follows the TWA. However, groups such as the observed ones in the
solar vicinity can be reproduced by different parameter combinations. Data from
velocity distributions at larger distances are needed for a definitive
constraint.

M_{\odot} (r/pc)^{1.33}$ in the mass-size space of molecular structures
recently proposed by Kauffmann & Pillai (2010). As a first step, we build on
the hypothesis of a volume density threshold for overall star formation and the
model of Parmentier (2011) to establish the mass-radius relations of molecular
clumps containing given masses of star-forming gas. Specifically, we relate the
mass $m_{clump}$, radius $r_{clump}$ and density profile slope $-p$ of
molecular clumps which contain a mass $m_{th}$ of gas denser than a volume
density threshold $\rho_{th}$. In a second step, we use the relation between
the mass of embedded-clusters and the mass of their most-massive star to
estimate the minimum mass of star-forming gas needed to form a $10\,M_{\odot}$
star. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $SFE \simeq 0.30$, this gives
$m_{th,crit} \simeq 150 M_{\odot}$. In a third step, we demonstrate that, for
sensible choices of the clump density index ($p \simeq 1.7$) and of the cluster
formation density threshold ($n_{th} \simeq 10^4\,cm^{-3}$), the line of
constant $m_{th,crit} \simeq 150 M_{\odot}$ in the mass-radius space of
molecular structures equates with the MSF limit for spatial scales larger than
0.3\,pc. Hence, the observationally inferred MSF limit of Kauffmann & Pillai is
consistent with a threshold in star-forming gas mass beyond which the
star-forming gas reservoir is large enough to allow the formation of massive
stars. For radii smaller than 0.3\,pc, the MSF limit is shown to be consistent
with the formation of a $10\,M_{\odot}$ star out of its individual pre-stellar
core of density threshold $n_{th} \simeq 10^5\,cm^{-3}$. The inferred density
thresholds for the formation of star clusters and individual stars within star
clusters match those previously suggested in the literature.

serious deficiency as a model for the origin of the seeds of cosmic structure:
it can not truly account for the transition from an early homogeneous and
isotropic stage to another one lacking such symmetries. The issue has often
been thought as a standard instance of the ""quantum measurement problem"", but
as has been recently argued by some of us the situation reaches a critical
level in the cosmological context of interest here. This has lead to a proposal
in which the standard paradigm is supplemented by a hypothesis concerning the
self-induced dynamical collapse of the wave function, as representing the
physical mechanism through which such change of symmetry is brought forth. This
proposal was formulated within the context of semiclassical gravity. Here we
investigate an alternative realization of such idea implemented directly within
the standard analysis in terms of a quantum field jointly describing the

uniformly higher (at a given mass) than the unbarred sample by ~0.06 dex.
However, the fibre SFRs of the visually classified barred galaxies are higher
by about 60% only in the galaxies with total stellar mass log M > 10. The metal
enhancement at log M<10 without an accompanying increase in the SFR may be due
to a short-lived phase of early bar-triggered star formation in the past,
compared to on-going star formation rate enhancements in higher mass barred
galaxies. There is no correlation between bar length or bar axial ratio with
the enhancement of the star formation rate. In order to assess the relative
importance of star formation triggered by bars and galaxy-galaxy interactions,
SFRs are also determined for a sample of close galaxy pairs. Both mechanisms
appear to be similarly effective at triggering central star formation for
galaxies with log M>10. However, due to the much lower fraction of pairs than
bars, bars account for ~3.5 times more triggered central star formation than
interactions.

photons during the early phases of the cosmic reionization. Little is known
however, when it comes to escape fractions and the mechanisms behind the
leakage. To learn more one may look at local objects, but so far only one low-z
galaxy has shown any sign of emitting LyC radiation. With data from the Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), Bergvall et al. (2006) found an
absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons (f_esc) of 4-10% for the blue
compact galaxy Haro 11. However, using a newer version of the reduction
pipeline on the same data set, Grimes et al. (2007) could not confirm this and
derived an upper limit of f_esc \leq 2%. Here, using the last version of the
pipeline CalFUSE v3.2, we aim at settling the question if Haro 11 is emitting
ionizing radiation to a significant level or not. We also investigate the
performance of the reduction pipeline for faint targets such as Haro 11. At
these faint flux levels both FUSE and CalFUSE are pushed to their limits, and a
detailed analysis was undertaken. We show that non-simultaneous background
estimates are insuffient when working with low signal-to-noise data, and a new
background model was developed based on a direct fit to the detector response.
Applying the new background fit, a significant signal in the LyC emerged in
both detector segments covering these wavelengths. Thus, the leakage is
confirmed with a flux density of f_900=4.0 *10^{-15} erg/s/cm^2/{\AA}
(S/N=4.6), measured on the airglow free regions in the LyC for the night only
data. This corresponds to an absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons for
Haro 11 of f_esc=3.3 \pm 0.7%. The results were confirmed by investigating the
2D data, the count rates and the residual flux in CII(1036{\AA}).

invite a comparison with the output of hydrodynamic simulations of star
formation. In this work we investigate the state of mass segregation of 'stars'

simulations which omit feedback. We first discuss methods to quantify mass
segregation in substructured regions, either based on the minimum spanning tree
(Allison's Lambda), or through analysis of correlations between stellar mass
and local stellar surface number densities. We find that the presence of even a
single 'outlier' (i.e. a massive object far from other stars) can cause the
Allison Lambda method to describe the system as inversely mass segregated, even
where in reality the most massive sink particles are overwhelmingly in the
centres of the subclusters. We demonstrate that a variant of the Lambda method
is less susceptible to this tendency but also argue for an alternative
representation of the data in the plane of stellar mass versus local surface
number density.
  The hydrodynamical simulations show global mass segregation from very early
times which continues throughout the simulation, being only mildly influenced
during sub-cluster merging.
  We find that up to approx. 2-3% of the ""massive"" sink particles (m > 2.5
Msun) are in relative isolation because they have formed there, although other
sink particles can form later in their vicinity. Ejections of massive sinks
from subclusters do not contribute to the number of isolated massive sink
particles, as the gravitational softening in the calculation suppresses this
process.

pairwise redshift likelihoods, we find that approximately half of compact
groups in the parent sample contain one or more projected (interloping)
members; our final clean sample contains 4566 galaxies in 1086 compact groups.
We show that half of the remaining CGs are associated with rich groups (or
clusters), i.e. they are embedded sub-structure. The other half have spatial
distributions and number-density profiles consistent with the interpretation
that they are either independently distributed structures within the field
(i.e. they are isolated) or associated with relatively poor structures.
Comparisons of late-type and red-sequence fractions in radial annuli show that
galaxies around apparently isolated compact groups resemble the field
population by 300 to 500 kpc from the group centre. In contrast, the galaxy
population surrounding embedded compact groups appears to remain distinct from
the field out beyond 1 to 2 Mpc, consistent with results for rich groups. We
take this as additional evidence that the observed distinction between compact
groups, i.e. isolated vs. embedded, is a separation between different host
environments.

far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of 0.7<z<2.5 normal star
forming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation of
star formation rate and stellar mass). Our deep data confirm from individual
far-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated if
based on 24 um fluxes and SED templates that are calibrated via local trends
with luminosity. Galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nuLnu(8) to 8-1000
um infrared luminosity (LIR) tend to lie along lines of constant offset from
the main sequence. We explore the relation between SED shape and offset in
specific star formation rate (SSFR) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.
Main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nuLnu(8)/LIR regardless of LIR
and redshift, up to z~2.5, and nuLnu(8)/LIR decreases with increasing offset
above the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. We
provide a redshift-independent calibration of SED templates in the range of
8--60 um as a function of log(SSFR) offset from the main sequence. Redshift
dependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.
Ultra deep IRS spectra match these SED trends well and verify that they are
mostly due to a change in ratio of PAH to LIR rather than continua of hidden
AGN. Alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nuLnu(8)/LIR on LIR. Same
nuLnu(8)/LIR is reached at increasingly higher LIR at higher redshift, with
shifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(LIR) at redshifts z~1 and
z~2. Corresponding SED template calibrations are provided for use if no stellar
masses are in hand. For most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also host
an AGN, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

Grothendieck ring, which in the non-o-minimal case is a non-trivial invariant.
To study this invariant, we identify a third o-minimalistic property, the
Discrete Pigeonhole Principle, which in turn allows us to define discretely
valued Euler characteristics.

theater, a 3 m cube with displays covering all six rigid faces. Headphones are

loudspeakers are preferable since they enhance the sense of total immersion.
The proposed solution consists of open-loop acoustic point control. The
transfer function, a matrix of room frequency responses from the loudspeakers
to the ears of the user, is inverted using multi-channel inversion methods, to
create exactly the desired sound field at the user's ears. The inverse transfer
function is constructed from impulse responses simulated by the image source
method. This technique is validated by measuring a 2x2 matrix transfer
function, simulating a transfer function with the same geometry, and filtering
the measured transfer function through the inverse of the simulation. Since
accuracy of the image source method decreases with time, inversion performance
is improved by windowing the simulated response prior to inversion. Parameters
of the simulation and inversion are adjusted to minimize residual reverberant
energy; the best-case dereverberation ratio is 10 dB.

young gas in an overdensity of galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.6 in the Great
Observatories Origins Deep Survey southern field (GOODS-S). The gas is
identified thanks to the ultra-strong Mg II absorption features it imprints in
the rest-frame UV spectra of galaxies in the background of the overdensity.
There is no evidence that the optically-thick gas is part of any massive galaxy
(i.e. M_star > 4x10^9 M_sun), but rather is associated with the overdensity;
less massive and fainter galaxies (25.5 < z_850 < 27.5 mag) have too large an
impact parameter to be causing ultra-strong absorption systems, based on our
knowledge of such systems. The lack of corresponding Fe II absorption features,
not detected even in co-added spectra, suggests that the gas is chemically more
pristine than the ISM and outflows of star-forming galaxies at similar
redshift, including those in the overdensity itself, and comparable to the most
metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo. A crude estimate of the projected
covering factor of the high-column density gas (N_H >~ 10^20 cm-2) based on the
observed fraction of galaxies with ultra-strong absorbers is C_F ~ 0.04. A
broad, continuum absorption profile extending to the red of the interstellar Mg
II absorption line by <~ 2000 km/s is possibly detected in two independent
co-added spectra of galaxies of the overdensity, consistent with a large-scale
infall motion of the gas onto the overdensity and its galaxies. Overall, these
findings provides the first tentative evidence of accretion of cold, chemically
young gas onto galaxies at high redshift, possibly feeding their star formation
activity. The fact that the galaxies are members of a large structure, as
opposed to field galaxies, might play a significant role in our ability to
detect the accreting gas.

HAT-P-32b orbits the bright V=11.289 star GSC 3281-00800, with a period P =
2.150008 d. The stellar and planetary masses and radii depend on the
eccentricity of the system, which is poorly constrained due to the high
velocity jitter (~80m/s). Assuming a circular orbit, the star has a mass of
1.16+-0.04 M_sun, and radius of 1.22+-0.02 R_sun, while the planet has a mass
of 0.860+-0.164 MJ, and a radius of 1.789+-0.025 RJ. When the eccentricity is
allowed to vary, the best-fit model results in a planet which is close to
filling its Roche Lobe. Including the constraint that the planet cannot exceed
its Roche Lobe results in the following best-fit parameters: e = 0.163+-0.061,
Mp = 0.94+-0.17 MJ, Rp = 2.04+-0.10 RJ, Ms = 1.18+0.04-0.07 M_sun and Rs =
1.39+-0.07 R_sun. The second planet, HAT-P-33b, orbits the bright V=11.188 star
GSC 2461-00988, with a period P = 3.474474 d. As for HAT-P-32, the stellar and
planetary masses and radii of HAT-P-33 depend on the eccentricity, which is
poorly constrained due to the high jitter (~50m/s). In this case spectral line
bisector spans are significantly anti-correlated with the radial velocity
residuals, and we use this correlation to reduce the residual rms to ~35m/s. We
find the star has a mass of either 1.38+-0.04 M_sun or 1.40+-0.10 M_sun, and a
radius of either 1.64+-0.03 R_sun or 1.78+-0.28 R_sun, while the planet has a
mass of either 0.762+-0.101 MJ or 0.763+-0.117 MJ, and a radius of either
1.686+-0.045 RJ or 1.827+-0.290 RJ, for an assumed circular orbit or for the
best-fit eccentric orbit respectively. Due to the large bisector span
variations exhibited by both stars we rely on detailed modeling of the

than that of pure Sim and Cn (m, n = 1 - 8) clusters because for a given
cluster size the heteroatomic clusters have more isomers than the homoatomic

(chain), prolate, and compact. For most clusters, we can clearly observe orders
of {\alpha}(linear) > {\alpha}(prolate) and {\alpha}(prolate) >
{\alpha}(compact) for a given composition. The composition-dependence of
polarizabilities reveals that the linear clusters have an obvious larger
polarizability than both the prolate and the compact clusters especially for a
given m/n value. The shape effect makes a main contribution to determine the
size of the polarizability. To understand the size of polarizability and the
evolution of polarizability, we have tried many factors, such as the energy gap
and binding energy, and defined a new parameter ({\Delta}q) that characterizes
the redistribution of charge in cluster. We find that both the binding energy
and the {\Delta}q are more available than the energy gap for reflecting the
evolution of polarizabilities provided that both the cluster shape and one of
the components in cluster are fixed. The correlation between the polarizability

half of the clouds show a detectable maximum reflectance in the glint

fraction (area weighted) of oriented plates in clouds lies between 10-3 and

plates on the cloud albedo is insignificant. The largest proportion of clouds
with horizontally oriented plates is found in the range 500-700 hPa, in
agreement with typical in situ observation of plates in clouds. We propose a
simple aerodynamic model that accounts for the orienting torque of the flow as
the plate falls under its own gravity and the disorienting effects of Brownian
motion and atmospheric turbulence. The model indicates that the horizontal
plate diameters are in the range 0.1 to a few millimeters. For such sizes,
Brownian forces have a negligible impact on the plate orientation. On the other

imperfect information never ""knows"" for sure that the current position is one
of the distinguished ""secret"" positions. We study the problems of deciding the
existence of a winning strategy for each player, and we call them the
opacity-violate problem and the opacity-guarantee problem. Focusing on the
player with perfect information is new in the field of games with
imperfect-information because when considering classical winning conditions it
amounts to solving the underlying perfect-information game. We establish the
EXPTIME-completeness of both above-mentioned problems, showing that our winning
condition brings a gap of complexity for the player with perfect information,
and we exhibit the relevant opacity-verify problem, which noticeably
generalizes approaches considered in the literature for opacity analysis in
discrete-event systems. In the case of blindfold games, this problem relates to
the two initial ones, yielding the determinacy of blindfold games with opacity
condition and the PSPACE-completeness of the three problems.

recursion such that every recursive call in the body of a function definition

be nested. This paper shows bimorphic recursion has principal types and
decidable type inference. Hence bimorphic recursion gives us flexible typing
for recursion with decidable type inference. This paper also shows that its
typability becomes undecidable because of nesting of recursions when one
removes the instantiation property from the bimorphic recursion.

an extension of data automata which unifies different automata models on data

can simulate two-counter machines. In this paper, a decidable model called
class automata with priority class condition, which restricts class automata
but strictly extends data automata, is proposed. The decidability of this model
is obtained by establishing a correspondence with priority multicounter
automata. This correspondence also completes the picture of the links between
various class conditions of class automata and various models of counter

Alur, Cern\'y and Weinstein on the algorithmic analysis of array-accessing

main goal is to measure the last unknown lepton sector mixing angle
{\theta}_{13} by observing {\nu}_e appearance in a {\nu}_{\mu} beam. It also
aims to make a precision measurement of the known oscillation parameters,
{\Delta}m^{2}_{23} and sin^{2} 2{\theta}_{23}, via {\nu}_{\mu} disappearance
studies. Other goals of the experiment include various neutrino cross section
measurements and sterile neutrino searches. The experiment uses an intense
proton beam generated by the J-PARC accelerator in Tokai, Japan, and is
composed of a neutrino beamline, a near detector complex (ND280), and a far
detector (Super-Kamiokande) located 295 km away from J-PARC. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of the instrumentation aspect of the T2K
experiment and a summary of the vital information for each subsystem.

temporal logics (pushdown module checking or PMC) has been recently
investigated in the literature, both in the context of environments with
perfect and imperfect information about the system (in the last case, the
environment has only a partial view of the system's control states and stack
content). For standard CTL, PMC with imperfect information is known to be
undecidable. If the stack content is assumed to be visible, then the problem is
decidable and 2EXPTIME-complete (matching the complexity of PMC with perfect
information against CTL). The decidability status of PMC with imperfect
information against CTL restricted to the case where the depth of the stack
content is visible is open. In this paper, we show that with this restriction,
PMC with imperfect information against CTL remains undecidable. On the other
hand, we individuate an interesting subclass of OPDS with visible stack content
depth such that PMC with imperfect information against the existential fragment
of CTL is decidable and in 2EXPTIME. Moreover, we show that the program
complexity of PMC with imperfect information and visible stack content against
CTL is 2EXPTIME-complete (hence, exponentially harder than the program
complexity of PMC with perfect information, which is known to be
EXPTIME-complete).

classification with immediate implications on the feasibility and complexity of

revisit the notion of safety for reactive systems, i.e., for systems whose
behavior is characterized by the interplay of uncontrolled environment inputs
and controlled system outputs. We show that reactive safety is a strictly
larger class of properties than standard safety. We provide algorithms for
checking if a property, given as a temporal formula or as a word or tree
automaton, is a reactive safety property and for translating such properties
into safety automata. Based on this construction, the standard verification and
synthesis algorithms for safety properties immediately extend to the larger
class of reactive safety.

hybrid systems from a game-theoretical point of view. A hybrid system is a
system mixing continuous and discrete behaviours that cannot be faithfully
modeled neither by using a formalism with continuous dynamics only nor by a
formalism including only discrete dynamics. We use the well known framework of
hybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and we define a Fault Diagnosis
Game on them, using two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The
environment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a
fault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behaviour of the system and
announces whether a fault has occurred or not. Existence of a winning strategy
for the diagnoser implies that faults can be detected correctly, while
computing such a winning strategy corresponds to implement a diagnoser for the
system. We will show how to determine the existence of a winning strategy, and
how to compute it, for some decidable classes of hybrid automata like o-minimal
hybrid automata.

the code used is maximum distance separable (MDS), then the system can tolerate
any (n-k) disk failures, since the original information can be recovered from
any k surviving disks. The focus of this paper is the design of a systematic
MDS code with the additional property that a single disk failure can be
repaired with minimum repair bandwidth, i.e., with the minimum possible amount
of data to be downloaded for recovery of the failed disk. Previously, a lower
bound of (n-1)/(n-k) units has been established by Dimakis et. al, on the
repair bandwidth for a single disk failure in an (n,k) MDS code . Recently, the
existence of asymptotic codes achieving this lower bound for arbitrary (n,k)
has been established by drawing connections to interference alignment. While
the existence of asymptotic constructions achieving this lower bound have been
shown, finite code constructions achieving this lower bound existed in previous
literature only for the special (high-redundancy) scenario where $k \leq
\max(n/2,3)$. The question of existence of finite codes for arbitrary values of
(n,k) achieving the lower bound on the repair bandwidth remained open. In this
paper, by using permutation coding sub-matrices, we provide the first known
finite MDS code which achieves the optimal repair bandwidth of (n-1)/(n-k) for
arbitrary (n,k), for recovery of a failed systematic disk. We also generalize
our permutation matrix based constructions by developing a novel framework for
repair-bandwidth-optimal MDS codes based on the idea of subspace interference
alignment - a concept previously introduced by Suh and Tse the context of
wireless cellular networks.

functional determinant representation. We consider the scalar field with
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The asymptotic expansions of the
Casimir energy and the Casimir force when the separation $a$ between the
cylinder and the plate is small are derived. As in the zero temperature case,
it is found that the leading terms of the Casimir energy and the Casimir force
agree with those derived from the proximity force approximation when $rT\gg 1$,
where $r$ is the radius of the cylinder. When $aT\ll 1\ll rT$ (the medium
temperature region), the leading term of the Casimir energy is of order
$T^{5/2}$ whereas for the Casimir force, it is of order $T^{7/2}$. In this
case, the leading terms are independent of the separation $a$. When $1\ll aT\ll
rT$ (the high temperature region), the dominating terms of the Casimir energy
and the Casimir force come from the zeroth Matsubara frequency. In this case,
the leading terms are linear in $T$, but for the energy, it is inversely
proportional to $a^{3/2}$, whereas for the force, it is inversely proportional
to $a^{5/2}$. The first order corrections to the proximity force approximations
in different temperature regions are computed using perturbation approach. In
the zero temperature case, the results agree with those derived in [Bordag,

performing the integration over the pure spinor space as a multidimensional
Cauchy-type integral. The amplitude will be written in terms of the projective
pure spinor variables, which turns out to be useful to relate rigorously the
minimal and non-minimal versions of the pure spinor formalism. The natural
language for relating these formalisms is the Cech-Dolbeault isomorphism.
Moreover, the Dolbeault cocycle corresponding to the tree-level scattering
amplitude must be evaluated in SO(10)/SU(5) instead of the whole pure spinor
space, which means that the origin is removed from this space. Also, the
Cech-Dolbeault language plays a key role for proving the invariance of the
scattering amplitude under BRST, Lorentz and supersymmetry transformations, as
well as the decoupling of unphysical states. We also relate the Green's
function for the massless scalar field in ten dimensions to the tree-level
scattering amplitude and comment about the scattering amplitude at higher
orders. In contrast with the traditional picture lowering operators, with our
new proposal the tree level scattering amplitude is independent of the constant
spinors introduced to define them and the BRST exact terms decouple without
integrating over these constant spinors.

Universe. If so, their phase-space density must be high enough to form a

differs from that of standard collisionless CDM (sCDM), so observations of
galactic haloes may distinguish them. sCDM has problems with galaxy
observations on small scales, which BEC-CDM may overcome for a large range of
particle mass m and self-interaction strength g. For quantum-coherence on

from tidal-torquing by large-scale structure, just as for sCDM. Since lab BECs
develop quantum vortices if rotated rapidly enough, we ask if this angular
momentum is sufficient to form vortices in BEC haloes, affecting their
structure with potentially observable consequences. The minimum angular
momentum for this, L_{QM} = $\hbar M/m$, requires m >= 9.5 m_H for lambda =
0.05, close to the particle mass required to influence structure on galactic
scales. We study the equilibrium of self-gravitating, rotating BEC haloes which
satisfy the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, to calculate if and when
vortices are energetically favoured. Vortices form as long as self-interaction
is strong enough, which includes a large part of the range of m and g of

antimatter. Such a scenario demands a mechanism for transformation of matter to
antimatter (or antimatter to matter) during the final stage of a big crunch. By
giving an example, we have shown that in principle such a mechanism is
possible. Our mechanism is based on a hypothetical repulsion between matter and
antimatter, existing at least deep inside the horizon of a black hole. When
universe is reduced to a supermassive black hole of a small size, a very strong
field of the conjectured force might create (through a Schwinger type
mechanism) particle-antiparticle pairs from the quantum vacuum. The amount of
antimatter created from the vacuum is equal to the decrease of mass of the
black hole and violently repelled from it. When the size of the black hole is
sufficiently small, the creation of antimatter may become so fast, that matter
of our Universe might be transformed to antimatter in a fraction of second.
Such a fast conversion of matter into antimatter may look as a Big Bang. Our
mechanism prevents a singularity; a new cycle might start with an initial size
more than 30 orders of magnitude greater than the Planck length, suggesting
that there is no need for inflationary scenario in Cosmology. In addition,
there is no need to invoke CP violation for explanation of matter-antimatter
asymmetry. Simply, our present day Universe is dominated by matter, because the
previous universe was dominated by antimatter.

make some notes about the Post-Newtonian limit of the case $\omega=0$. This
case is dynamically equivalent to the metric $f(R)$ theory. It is known that
this theory can be compatible with the solar system tests if Chameleon
mechanism occurs. Also, it is known that this mechanism is because of the
non-linearity in the field equations produced by the largeness of the local
curvature relative to the background curvature. Thus, the linearization of the
field equations breaks down. On the other hand we know that Chameleon mechanism
exists when a coupling between the matter and the scalar field exists. In the
Jordan frame of Brans-Dicke theory, we have not such a coupling. But in the
Einstein frame this theory behaves like a Chameleon scalar field. By confining
ourselves to the case $\omega=0$, we show that ""Chameleon-like"" behavior can
exist also in the Jordan frame but it has an important difference compared with
the Chameleon mechanism. Also we show that the conditions which lead to the
existence of ""Chameleon-like"" mechanism are consistent with the conditions in
the Post-Newtonian limit which correspond to a heavy scalar filed at the
cosmological scale and a small effective cosmological constant. Thus, one can
linearize field equations to the Post-Newtonian order and this linearization
has not any contradiction with the existence of ""Chameleon-like"" behavior.

pointed out by many authors. Finding an answer to this difficult question is of
importance to model time-series showing trend-like behavior, such as river
run-off in hydrology, historical temperatures in the study of climates changes,
or packet counts in network traffic engineering. The main goal of this paper is
to develop a test procedure to detect the presence of non-stationarity for a
class of processes whose $K$-th order difference is stationary. Contrary to
most of the proposed methods, the test procedure has the same distribution for
short-range and long-range dependence covariance stationary processes, which
means that this test is able to detect the presence of non-stationarity for
processes showing long-range dependence or which are unit root. The proposed
test is formulated in the wavelet domain, where a change in the generalized
spectral density results in a change in the variance of wavelet coefficients at
one or several scales. Such tests have been already proposed in
\cite{whitcher:2001}, but these authors do not have taken into account the
dependence of the wavelet coefficients within scales and between scales.
Therefore, the asymptotic distribution of the test they have proposed was
erroneous; as a consequence, the level of the test under the null hypothesis of
stationarity was wrong. In this contribution, we introduce two test procedures,
both using an estimator of the variance of the scalogram at one or several
scales. The asymptotic distribution of the test under the null is rigorously
justified. The pointwise consistency of the test in the presence of a single
jump in the general spectral density is also be presented. A limited
Monte-Carlo experiment is performed to illustrate our findings.

parameters, based on dynamical rather than geometrical considerations, so that
the analysis applies more naturally to rotating shear flows in general and not
only to Taylor-Couette flow. We then investigate the transition thresholds in
the supercritical and the subcritical regime in order to extract their general

provides us with some general hints on the mean to laminar shear ratio. Then
the examination of the torque data allows us to propose a decomposition of the

of an 'objective randomness', i.e. a basic property of the vacuum state which
is independent of any experimental accuracy of the observations or limited
knowledge of initial conditions. Besides being responsible for the observed
quantum behaviour, this might introduce a weak, residual form of `noise' which
is intrinsic to natural phenomena and could be important for the emergence of
complexity at higher physical levels. By adopting Stochastic Electro Dynamics
as a heuristic model, we are driven to a picture of the vacuum as a form of
highly turbulent ether, which is deep-rooted into the basic foundational
aspects of both quantum physics and relativity, and to search for experimental
tests of this scenario. An analysis of the most precise ether-drift
experiments, operating both at room temperature and in the cryogenic regime,
shows that, at present, there is some ambiguity in the interpretation of the
data. In fact the average amplitude of the signal has precisely the magnitude
expected, in a 'Lorentzian' form of relativity, from an underlying stochastic
ether and, as such, might not be a spurious instrumental effect. This puzzle,
however, should be solved in a next future with the use of new cryogenically
cooled optical resonators whose stability should improve by about two orders of
magnitude. In these new experimental conditions, the persistence of the present
amplitude would represent a clean evidence for the type of random vacuum we are

can spontaneously self-organize into stable small clusters, or membrane
nano-domains, due to the competition between short-range attractive and
longer-range repulsive forces between proteins, specific to these systems. In
this paper, we carry on our investigation, by Monte Carlo simulations, of
different aspects of cluster phases of proteins in bio-membranes. First, we
compare different long-range potentials (including notably three-body terms) to
demonstrate that the existence of cluster phases should be quite generic.
Furthermore, a real membrane contains hundreds of different protein species
that are far from being randomly distributed in these nano-domains. We take
this protein diversity into account by modulating protein-protein interaction
potentials both at short and longer range. We confirm theoretical predictions
in terms of biological cluster specialization by deciphering how clusters
recruit only a few protein species. In this respect, we highlight that cluster
phases can turn out to be an advantage at the biological level, for example by
enhancing the cell response to external stimuli.

vibration, due to their flexibility, which often cause irreversible damage. In
nature, trees repeatedly endure large amplitudes of motion, mostly caused by
strong climatic events, yet with minor or no damage in most cases. A new
damping mechanism inspired by the architecture of trees is here identified and
characterized in the simplest tree-like structure, a Y-shape branched
structure. Through analytical and numerical analyses of a simple
two-degree-of-freedom model, branching is shown to be the key ingredient in
this protective mechanism that we call damping-by-branching. It originates in
the geometrical nonlinearities so that it is specifically efficient to damp out
large amplitudes of motion. A more realistic model, using flexible beam
approximation, shows that the mechanism is robust. Finally, two bioinspired
architectures are analyzed, showing significant levels of damping achieved via
branching with typically 30% of the energy being dissipated in one oscillation.
This concept of damping-by-branching is of simple practical use in the design
of slender flexible structures.

description--- of instabilities in systems which are driven, i.e., maintained
far from equilibrium by an external forcing. We focus here on two main classes,
namely, driven--diffusive fluids and driven granular gases.
  A particular driven-diffusive lattice model, prototype for nonequilibrium
phase transitions, is investigated. A well-known disadvantage of lattice models
is that, when they are compared directly with experiment, often do not account
for important features of the corresponding nonequilibrium phase diagram, such
as structural, morphological, and even critical properties. Furthermore,
theoreticians often tend to consider them as prototypical models for certain
behavior, a fact which is in many cases not justified. This is discussed in the
first part of this thesis, where we introduce a novel, realistic model for
computer simulation of anisotropic fluids.
  The second class of systems we consider in this thesis concerns driven
granular gases. We study clustering, symmetry breaking, and phase separation
instabilities in two-dimensional driven granular gases, using both molecular
dynamics simulations and granular hydrodynamics. Hydrostatic predictions are
tested by comparing with molecular dynamics simulations. We are able to develop
an effective Langevin description for close-packed macroparticle, confined by a
harmonic potential and driven by a delta-correlated noise.

and the Fornax-Eridanus complex, avoiding methods like the virial or fits of

  Methods. Our mass estimate is based on the determination of the zero-velocity
surface which, in the context of the spherical infall model permits an
evaluation of the total mass inside such a surface. The zero-velocity surface
radius R0 was estimated either by a running median procedure or by fitting the
data to the velocity field expected from the spherical model, including effects
of the cosmological constant. The velocity field in a region within 20 Mpc of
the Fornax center was mapped using a list of 109 galaxies whose distances have
an average accuracy of 0.31 mag in their distance modulus.
  Results. Our analysis indicates that the mass of the Fornax cluster itself
inside a radius of [2.62-5.18] Mpc is [0.40-3.32] \times 10^14 Modotwhile the
mass inside [3.88-5.60] Mpc, corresponding to the Fornax-Eridanus complex is

far, showing the only quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) reliably detected in an
Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Comparison with similar spectral and timing
properties observed in the black hole X-ray binary (BHB) GRS 1915+105 suggests
that RE J1034+396 is a super-Eddington accretor. A more complete understanding
of the behaviour of RE J1034+396 can therefore lead to a unification of the
accretion physics between such extreme AGN and super-Eddington BHBs. Here we
report on our latest XMM-Newton observations of RE J1034+396, which no longer
show the QPO, indicating that this source shows a non-stationary
power-spectrum. We use spectral and temporal analysis across all five
XMM-Newton observations of the source to probe the evolution of the object. The
combination of the shape of the fractional variability with energy and the
inferred velocity of absorbing material in the line-of-sight rules out an
absorption-only method of creating the QPO. Instead the periodically changing
absorption may be produced by the QPO causing a change in ionization state. We
extend our analysis by including the covariance spectra which give much better
signal to noise than an rms spectrum. These reveal a new aspect of the QPO,
which is that there is also a small contribution from a soft component which is
hotter than the soft excess seen in the mean spectrum. Folding the lightcurve
on the QPO period shows that this component lags behind the hard X-rays. If
this is due to re-processing then the lag corresponding to a light travel time
across 30 R_g. Some of the remaining observations have similar energy spectra
and covariance spectra, but none of them show a significant QPO, so we conclude
that none of these features are the trigger for the appearance of the QPO in
this object.

synthesis telescopes is a promising tool to study the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR). Limiting the confusion from Galactic and Extragalactic foregrounds is
critical to the success of these telescopes. Instrumental response or the Point
Spread Function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently 3 dimensional with
frequency mapping to the Line of Sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will
necessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists;
therefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so
that the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper
aims to understand the 3 dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the
same framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination
along frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship
between foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on
the Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground
contamination-'PSF contamination' and 'gridding contamination'. We show that
'PSF contamination' is localized in LOS wavenumber space, beyond which there
potentially exists an 'EoR window' with negligible foreground contamination
where we may focus our efforts to detect EoR. 'PSF contamination' in this
window may be substantially reduced by judicious choice of a frequency window
function. Gridding and imaging algorithms create additional 'gridding
contamination' and we propose a new imaging algorithm using the Chirp Z
Transform (CZT) that significantly reduces this contamination. Finally, we
demonstrate the analytical relationships and the merit of the new imaging
algorithm for the case of imaging with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

Skyrmions. The orientations of the spinning Skyrmions corresponding to
polarised protons, neutrons and deuterons are identified. Nuclear collisions
and the nuclear spin-orbit force are discussed in terms of classically spinning

structures associated with Rayleigh Taylor instability for arbitrary Atwood
number is extended with the inclusion of second harmonic mode leaving out the
zeroth harmonic one. The modification makes the fluid velocities vanish at
infinity and leads to avoidance of the need to make the unphysical assumption
of the existence of a time dependent source at infinity.
  The present analysis shows that for an initial interface perturbation with
curvature exceeding 1/(2sqrt{A}), where $A$ is the Atwood number there occurs
an almost free fall of the spike with continuously increasing sharpening as it
falls. The curvature at the tip of the spike also increases with Atwood number.
Certain initial condition may also result in occurrence of finite time
singularity as found in case of conformal mapping technique used earlier.

is valid for wavelengths $>4~\mu$m and is used to to assess level shifts due to

shifts have tensorial character and depend strongly on the polarization state

computationally efficient than these methods. We also perform computations for
an explicitly three dimensional, aperiodically time-dependent vector field and
an aperiodically time dependent vector field defined as a data set. Comparisons
with FTLEs and time averages for these examples are also carried out, with
similar conclusions as for the benchmark examples.

the microscopic approach predicts a notable increase of the survival

the phenomenological model our approach makes it possible to study the

visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals. Here,
unlike in the case of crystals where structures can be solved by model building
and phase refinement, the phase distribution of the wave scattered by an
individual molecule must directly be recovered. There are two well-known
solutions to the phase problem: holography and coherent diffraction imaging
(CDI). Both techniques have their pros and cons. In holography, the
reconstruction of the scattered complex-valued object wave is directly provided
by a well-defined reference wave that must cover the entire detector area which
often is an experimental challenge. CDI provides the highest possible, only
wavelength limited, resolution, but the phase recovery is an iterative process
which requires some pre-defined information about the object and whose outcome
is not always uniquely-defined. Moreover, the diffraction patterns must be
recorded under oversampling conditions, a pre-requisite to be able to solve the
phase problem. Here, we report how holography and CDI can be merged into one
superior technique: holographic coherent diffraction imaging (HCDI). An inline
hologram can be recorded by employing a modified CDI experimental scheme. We
demonstrate that the amplitude of the Fourier transform of an inline hologram
is related to the complex-valued visibility, thus providing information on
both, the amplitude and the phase of the scattered wave in the plane of the
diffraction pattern. With the phase information available, the condition of
oversampling the diffraction patterns can be relaxed, and the phase problem can
be solved in a fast and unambiguous manner.

'cycle' and 'connected' are interpreted topologically in the space containing
the respective edges and precisely the ends thus assigned.
  This property characterizes graph duality: if, conversely, the spanning trees
of two infinite graphs are complementary in this end-sharing way, the graphs

edges in images or shock fronts in solutions of transport-dominated equations.
One major goal both for the purpose of compression as well as for an efficient
analysis is the provision of optimally sparse approximations of such functions.
Recently, cartoon-like images were introduced in 2D and 3D as a suitable model
class, and approximation properties were measured by considering the decay rate
of the $L^2$ error of the best $N$-term approximation. Shearlet systems are to
date the only representation system, which provide optimally sparse
approximations of this model class in 2D as well as 3D. Even more, in contrast
to all other directional representation systems, a theory for compactly
supported shearlet frames was derived which moreover also satisfy this
optimality benchmark. This chapter shall serve as an introduction to and a
survey about sparse approximations of cartoon-like images by band-limited and
also compactly supported shearlet frames as well as a reference for the
state-of-the-art of this research field.

based on dynamo models. The maps of the magnetic pressure at the surface from
the dynamo calculations are treated similarly to the temperature maps obtained
using Doppler imaging techniques. A series of snapshots from the dynamo models
are cross-correlated to obtain the shift of the magnetic patterns at each
latitude and time point. The surface differential rotation patterns obtained
from the snapshots of the dynamo calculations show in all studied cases
variability over the activity cycle. In the models using only the large scale
dynamo field the measured rotation patterns are only at times similar to the
input rotation law. This is due to the spot motion being mainly determined by
the geometric properties of the large scale dynamo field. In the models with
additional small scale magnetic field the surface differential rotation
measured from the model follows well the input rotation law. The results imply
that the stellar spots caused by the large scale dynamo field are not
necessarily tracing the stellar differential rotation, whereas the spots formed
from small scale fields trace well the surface flow patterns. It can be
questioned whether the large spots observed in active stars could be caused by
small scale fields. Therefore, it is not clear that the true stellar surface
rotation can be recovered using measurements of large starspots, which are
currently the only ones that can be observed.

This intersection property has proven to be a valuable tool in investigating
these algebras. Motivated by this pivotal role, we study $C(X)'_1$ and
$C(X)'_*$ in detail in the present paper. The maximal ideal space of $C(X)'_1$
is described explicitly, and is seen to coincide with its pure state space and
to be a topological quotient of $X\times\mathbb{T}$. We show that $C(X)'_1$ is
hermitian and semisimple, and that its enveloping $C^*$-algebra is $C(X)'_*$.
Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for projections
onto $C(X)'_1$ and $C(X)'_*$ to exist, and give explicit formulas for such
projections, which we show to be unique. In the appendix, topological results

indispensable tool for any investigation of nuclear reactions in which
final-state interactions play a role. Studies of pion-nucleus interactions,
nuclear fragmentation, heavy ion reactions, hyper nucleus formation,
hadronization, color transparency, electron-nucleus collisions and
neutrino-nucleus interactions are all possible applications of GiBUU and are

interactions can undergo a ferromagnetic phase transition to a spin-polarized
state at a critical gas parameter $(k_{\rm F}a)_c$. Previous theoretical
predictions of the ferromagnetic phase transition have been based on the
perturbation theory, which treats the gas parameter as a small number. On the
other hand, Belitz, Kirkpatrick, and Vojta (BKV) have argued that the phase
transition in clean itinerant ferromagnets is generically of first order at low
temperatures, due to the correlation effects that lead to a nonanalytic term in
the free energy. The second-order perturbation theory predicts a first-order
phase transition at $(k_{\rm F}a)_c=1.054$, consistent with the BKV argument.
However, since the critical gas parameter is expected to be of order O(1),
perturbative predictions may be unreliable. In this paper we study the
nonperturbative effects on the ferromagnetic phase transition by summing the
particle-particle ladder diagrams to all orders in the gas parameter. We
consider a universal repulsive Fermi gas where the effective range effects can
be neglected, which can be realized in a two-component Fermi gas of $^6$Li
atoms by using a nonadiabatic field switch to the upper branch of a Feshbach
resonance with a positive s-wave scattering length. Our theory predicts a
second-order phase transition, which indicates that ferromagnetic transition in
dilute Fermi gases is possibly a counterexample to the BKV argument. The
predicted critical gas parameter $(k_{\rm F}a)_c=0.858$ is in good agreement
with the recent quantum Monte Carlo result $(k_{\rm F}a)_c=0.86$ for a nearly
zero-range potential [S. Pilati, \emph{et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 105},
030405 (2010)]. We also compare the spin susceptibility with the quantum Monte
Carlo result and find good agreement.

approximation and hypernetted chain theory) and numerical simulations. The
calculated pair structure, thermodynamics, phase diagram and polyion dynamics
of the symmetric version of the model (the ""ultrasoft restricted primitive

""restricted primitive model"" (RPM) where ions have hard cores. At sufficiently
low temperatures and densities, oppositely charged polyions form weakly
interacting, polarizable neutral pairs. The clustering probabilities,
dielectric behavior and electrical conductivity point to a line of sharp
conductor-insulator transitions in the density-temperature plane. At very low
temperatures the conductor-insulator transition line terminates near the top of
a first order coexistence curve separating a high-density, liquid phase from a
low-density, vapor phase. The simulation data hint at a tricritical behavior,
reminiscent of that observed of the two-dimensional Coulomb Gas, which
contrasts with the Ising criticality of its three-dimensional counterpart, the
RPM.

approach to enhancing the system throughput and spectrum efficiency of wireless
cellular systems. In contrast to the conventional single-cell beamforming (SBF)
design, MCBF jointly optimizes the beamforming vectors of cooperative base
stations (BSs) (via a central processing unit(CPU)) in order to mitigate the
intercell interference. While most of the existing designs assume that the CPU
has the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of mobile
stations (MSs), this paper takes into account the inevitable CSI errors at the
CPU, and study the robust MCBF design problem. Specifically, we consider the
worst-case robust design formulation that minimizes the weighted sum
transmission power of BSs subject to worst-case
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on MSs. The
associated optimization problem is challenging because it involves infinitely
many nonconvex SINR constraints. In this paper, we show that the worst-case
SINR constraints can be reformulated as linear matrix inequalities, and the
approximation method known as semidefinite relation can be used to efficiently
handle the worst-case robust MCBF problem. Simulation results show that the
proposed robustMCBF design can provide guaranteed SINR performance for the MSs
and outperforms the robust SBF design.

realistic case we consider in detail the different aspects of the elementary
excitations when the proton, electron components are considered within the
Random Phase Approximation generalized to the superfluid case, while the
influence of the neutron component is considered only at qualitative level.
Electron screening plays a major role in modifying the proton spectrum and
spectral function. At the same time the electron plasmon is strongly modified
and damped by the indirect coupling with the superfluid proton component, even
at moderately low values of the gap. The excitation spectrum shows the
interplay of the different components and their relevance for each excitation
mode. The results are relevant for neutrino physics and thermodynamical
processes in neutron stars. If electron screening is neglected, the spectral
properties of the proton component show some resemblance with the physical
situation in high T$_c$ superconductors, and we briefly discuss similarities

birth of coincidence methods, as well as later crucial applications during the
1930s and 1940s are presented. In 1924 Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger applied a
coincidence method to the study of Compton scattering with Geiger needle
counters. Their experiment confirmed the existence of radiation quanta and
established the validity of conservation principles in elementary processes. At
the end of the 1920s, Bothe and Werner Kolh\""orster coupled the coincidence
technique with the new Geiger-M\""uller counter to study cosmic rays, marking
the start of cosmic-ray research as a branch of physics. The coincidence method
was further refined by Bruno Rossi, who developed a vacuum-tube device capable
of registering the simultaneous occurrence of electrical pulses from any number
of counters with a tenfold improvement in time resolution. The electronic
coincidence circuit bearing Rossi's name was instrumental in his research on
the corpuscular nature and the properties of cosmic radiation during the early
1930s, a period characterized by a lively debate between Millikan and followers
of the corpuscular interpretation. The Rossi coincidence circuit was also at
the core of the counter-controlled cloud chamber developed by Patrick Blackett
and Giuseppe Occhialini, and became one of the important ingredients of
particle and nuclear physics. During the late 1930s and 1940s, coincidences,
anti-coincidences and delayed coincidences played a crucial role in a series of
experiments on the decay of the muon, which inaugurated the current era of
particle physics.

algebraic structure (such as symplectic groupoid structure) gets a geometrical
explanation via 3-dimensional cobordisms. We give a formula for the symplectic

closed 2-forms. This construction is finally used for a certain extension of
the Morita equivalence of quantum tori to the world of Poisson-Lie groups.

selection, phase selection, Boolean Constraint Propagation, conflict analysis,
clause learning and its database maintenance. Optimizing any part of these
components can enhance the performance of a solver. This paper focuses on
optimizing phase selection. Although the ACE (Approximation of the Combined
lookahead Evaluation) weight is applied to a lookahead SAT solver such as
March, so far, no conflict-driven SAT solver applies successfully the ACE
weight, since computing the ACE weight is time-consuming. Here we apply the ACE
weight to partial phase selection of conflict-driven SAT solvers. This can be
seen as an improvement of the heuristic proposed by Jeroslow-Wang (1990). We
incorporate the ACE heuristic and the existing phase selection heuristics in
the new solver MPhaseSAT, and select a phase heuristic in a way similar to
portfolio methods. Experimental results show that adding the ACE heuristic can
improve the conflict-driven solvers. Particularly on application instances,
MPhaseSAT with the ACE heuristic is significantly better than MPhaseSAT without
the ACE heuristic, and even can solve a few SAT instances that remain
unsolvable so far.

Hamiltonian are largely determined by the $k$-particle reduced density matrices
($k$-RDMs), or simply the $k$-matrix for fermionic systems---they are at least
enough for the calculation of the ground state and excited state energies.
Moreover, for a non-degenerate ground state of a $k$-local Hamiltonian, even
the state itself is completely determined by its $k$-RDMs, and therefore
contains no genuine ${>}k$-particle correlations, as they can be inferred from
$k$-particle correlation functions. It is natural to ask whether a similar
result holds for non-degenerate excited states. In fact, for fermionic systems,
it has been conjectured that any non-degenerate excited state of a 2-local
Hamiltonian is simultaneously a unique ground state of another 2-local
Hamiltonian, hence is uniquely determined by its 2-matrix. And a weaker version
of this conjecture states that any non-degenerate excited state of a 2-local
Hamiltonian is uniquely determined by its 2-matrix among all the pure
$n$-particle states. We construct explicit counterexamples to show that both
conjectures are false. It means that correlations in excited states of local
Hamiltonians could be dramatically different from those in ground states. We
further show that any non-degenerate excited state of a $k$-local Hamiltonian
is a unique ground state of another $2k$-local Hamiltonian, hence is uniquely
determined by its $2k$-RDMs (or $2k$-matrix).

most luminous known clusters in the z > 0.5 universe, and it is one of the most

clusters, PLCK G266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. This observation
confirms Planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,

the problem of computing $x^*$ that minimizes the expression $\sum_{f\in
F}f(x)$, over $x\in X$. A typical application is \emph{shape fitting}, where we
wish to approximate a set $P$ of $n$ elements (say, points) by a shape $x$ from
a (possibly infinite) family $X$ of shapes. Here, each point $p\in P$
corresponds to a function $f$ such that $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to $x$,
and we seek a shape $x$ that minimizes the sum of distances from each point in
$P$. In the $k$-clustering variant, each $x\in X$ is a tuple of $k$ shapes, and
$f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to its closest shape in $x$.
  Our main result is a unified framework for constructing {\em coresets} and
{\em approximate clustering} for such general sets of functions. To achieve our
results, we forge a link between the classic and well defined notion of
$\varepsilon$-approximations from the theory of PAC Learning and VC dimension,
to the relatively new (and not so consistent) paradigm of coresets, which are
some kind of ""compressed representation"" of the input set $F$. Using
traditional techniques, a coreset usually implies an LTAS (linear time
approximation scheme) for the corresponding optimization problem, which can be
computed in parallel, via one pass over the data, and using only
polylogarithmic space (i.e, in the streaming model).
  We show how to generalize the results of our framework for squared distances
(as in $k$-mean), distances to the $q$th power, and deterministic
constructions.
