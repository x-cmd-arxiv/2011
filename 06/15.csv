  First, it is proved that the secrecy function determining Eve's performance

is a special case of a conjecture by Belfiore and Sol\'e. Further, a very
simple method to verify or disprove the conjecture on any given unimodular

  Second, preliminary analysis on the behavior of Eve's probability of correct

compute the truncated inverse norm power sum factors in Eve's probability
expression. The analysis reveals a performance-secrecy-complexity tradeoff:
relaxing on the legitimate user's performance can significantly increase the

further increased by using skewed lattices, but at the cost of increased

with highly uncertain positions along the line of sight. Photometric surveys
with redshift uncertainty delta_z ~ 0.03 can yield final redshift uncertainties
of delta_z_f ~ 0.003 in high density regions. This increased redshift precision
is achieved by imposing an isotropy and 2-point correlation prior in a Bayesian
analysis and is completely independent of the process that estimates the
photometric redshift. As a byproduct, the method also infers the three
dimensional density field, essentially super-resolving high density regions in
redshift space. Our method fully takes into account the survey mask and
selection function. It uses a simplified Poissonian picture of galaxy
formation, relating preferred locations of galaxies to regions of higher
density in the matter field. The method quantifies the remaining uncertainties
in the three dimensional density field and the true radial locations of
galaxies by generating samples that are constrained by the survey data. The
exploration of this high dimensional, non-Gaussian joint posterior is made
feasible using multiple-block Metropolis-Hastings sampling. We demonstrate the
performance of our implementation on a simulation containing 2.0 x 10^7
galaxies. These results bear out the promise of Bayesian analysis for upcoming
photometric large scale structure surveys with tens of millions of galaxies.

nonperturbatively in the Resonance-Spectrum-Expansion model, by coupling
various open and closed meson-meson channels to the bare $J^P=1^+$ $c\bar{q}$

mixes and lifts the mass degeneracy of the spectroscopic $^3P_1$ and $^1P_1$

resulting $S$-matrix poles in either case, one stays very close to the energy
of the bare state, as a quasi-bound state in the continuum, whereas the other
shifts considerably. This is in agreement with the experimental observation
that the $D_1(2420)$ and $D_{s1}(2536)$ have much smaller widths than one would
naively expect. The whole pattern of masses and widths of the axial-vector
charmed mesons can thus be quite well reproduced with only two free parameters,

Dimopoulos et al.1 in 2008 was called AGIS-Sat. 2. It had a suggested
gravitational wave sensitivity set by the atom state detection shot noise level
that started at 1 mHz, was comparable to LISA sensitivity from 1 to about 20
mHz, and had better sensitivity from 20 to 500 mHz. The separation between the
spacecraft was 1,000 km, with atom interferometers 200 m long and shades from
sunlight used at each end. A careful analysis of many error sources was
included, but requirements on the time-stability of both the laser wavefront
aberrations and the atom temperatures in the atom clouds were not investigated.
After including these considerations, the laser wavefront aberration stability
requirement to meet the quoted sensitivity level is about 1\times10-8
wavelengths, and is far tighter than for LISA. Also, the temperature
fluctuations between atom clouds have to be less than 1 pK. An alternate atom
interferometer GW mission in Earth orbit called AGIS-LEO with 30 km satellite
separation has been suggested recently. The reduction of wavefront aberration
noise by sending the laser beam through a high-finesse mode-scrubbing optical

more difficult to design than a non-geocentric mission and does not appear to

both methods, we selected a target which does not present particular difficulty

The W3 star forming complex, located in the Perseus arm, offers a splendid
opportunity for such a task. We used the NIFS spectrograph on the Frederick C.
Gillett Gemini North telescope to classify candidate ""naked photosphere"" OB
stars based on 2MASS photometry. Two of the targets are revealed to be mid

band (d = 2.18 kpc, Humphreys 1978) and with a measurement of the W3
trigonometric parallax (d = 1.95 kpc, Xu et al. 2006). Such results confirm
that the spectrophotometric distances in the K band are reliable. The radio
derived kinematic distance, on the contrary, gives a distance twice as large (d
= 4.2 kpc, Russeil 2003). This indicates that this region of Perseus arm does
not follow the Galactic rotation curve, and this may be the case also for other

relaxed formulation of the harvesting model in such a manner that existence of
an optimal relaxed harvesting policy can not only be proven but also
identified. The analysis embeds the harvesting problem in an
infinite-dimensional linear program over a space of occupation measures in
which the initial position enters as a parameter and then analyzes an auxiliary
problem having fewer constraints. In this manner upper bounds are determined
for the optimal value (with the given initial position); these bounds depend on
the relation of the initial population size to a specific target size. The more
interesting case occurs when the initial population exceeds this target size; a
new argument is required to obtain a sharp upper bound. Though the initial
population size only enters as a parameter, the value is determined in a

is to recover almost all the sparse vectors using a small number of fixed

hard-thresholding operator that leads to a general family of iterative
algorithms. While one extreme of the family yields well known hard thresholding
algorithms like ITI (Iterative Thresholding with Inversion) and HTP (Hard
Thresholding Pursuit), the other end of the spectrum leads to a novel algorithm
that we call Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR). OMPR, like
the classic greedy algorithm OMP, adds exactly one coordinate to the support at
each iteration, based on the correlation with the current residual. However,
unlike OMP, OMPR also removes one coordinate from the support. This simple
change allows us to prove that OMPR has the best known guarantees for sparse
recovery in terms of the Restricted Isometry Property (a condition on the
measurement matrix). In contrast, OMP is known to have very weak performance
guarantees under RIP. Given its simple structure, we are able to extend OMPR
using locality sensitive hashing to get OMPR-Hash, the first provably
sub-linear (in dimensionality) algorithm for sparse recovery. Our proof
techniques are novel and flexible enough to also permit the tightest known
analysis of popular iterative algorithms such as CoSaMP and Subspace Pursuit.
We provide experimental results on large problems providing recovery for
vectors of size up to million dimensions. We demonstrate that for large-scale

assumption - uniformly bounded $2+\varepsilon$ moments of one-dimensional
marginals. Our argument consists of randomizing the spectral sparsifier, a
deterministic tool developed recently by Batson, Spielman and Srivastava [SIAM

control the spectral edges of the sample covariance matrix via the Stieltjes

information transfer. Finally we present simulations showing that individual

Slepian-Wolf problem) have been the subject of much investigation in the past
decade. In particular, near-capacity achieving code designs based on LDPC codes
have been presented for the case of two binary sources, with a binary-symmetric
correlation. However, constructing practical codes for the case of non-binary
sources with arbitrary correlation remains by and large open. From a practical
perspective it is also interesting to consider coding schemes whose performance
remains robust to uncertainties in the joint distribution of the sources.
  In this work we propose the usage of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for the
asymmetric version of this problem. We show that algebraic soft-decision
decoding of RS codes can be used effectively under certain correlation
structures. In addition, RS codes offer natural rate adaptivity and performance
that remains constant across a family of correlation structures with the same
conditional entropy. The performance of RS codes is compared with dedicated and
rate adaptive multistage LDPC codes (Varodayan et al. '06), where each LDPC
code is used to compress the individual bit planes. Our simulations show that
in classical Slepian-Wolf scenario, RS codes outperform both dedicated and
rate-adaptive LDPC codes under $q$-ary symmetric correlation, and are better
than rate-adaptive LDPC codes in the case of sparse correlation models, where
the conditional distribution of the sources has only a few dominant entries. In
a feedback scenario, the performance of RS codes is comparable with both
designs of LDPC codes. Our simulations also demonstrate that the performance of
RS codes in the presence of inaccuracies in the joint distribution of the
sources is much better as compared to multistage LDPC codes.

non-thermal emission. This very richness makes their interpretation challenging
since the low radio opacity means that a radio image represents the sum of all
emission regions along the line-of-sight. These challenges make the existing
narrow-band radio surveys of the Galactic plane difficult to interpret: e.g. a
small region of emission might be a supernova remnant (SNR) or an HII region,
or a complex combination of both. Instantaneous wide bandwidth radio
observations in combination with the capability for high resolution spectral
index mapping, can be directly used to disentangle these effects.
  Here we demonstrate simultaneous continuum and spectral index imaging
capability at the full continuum sensitivity and resolution using newly
developed wide-band wide-field imaging algorithms. Observations were done in
the L- and C-Band with a total bandwidth of 1 and 2 GHz respectively. We
present preliminary results in the form of a full-field continuum image
covering the wide-band sensitivity pattern of the EVLA centered on a large but
poorly studied SNR (G55.7+3.4) and relatively narrower field continuum and
spectral index maps of three fields containing SNR and diffused thermal
emission. We demonstrate that spatially resolved spectral index maps
differentiates regions with emission of different physical origin (spectral
index variation across composite SNRs and separation of thermal and non-thermal
emission), superimposed along the line of sight. The wide-field image centered
on the SNR G55.7+3.4 also demonstrates the excellent wide-field wide-band
imaging capability of the EVLA.

exhibit strong C IV absorption lines in their ultraviolet spectra with
equivalent width > 5 Angstroms. The X-ray spectra are inconsistent with the
hypothesis that these objects show normal QSO continua absorbed by
low-ionization gas. Instead, the spectra can be modelled successfully with
ionized absorbers, or with cold absorbers if they posess unusually flat X-ray
continuum shapes and unusual optical to X-ray spectral energy distributions. We
show that the ionized absorber model provides the simplest, most
self-consistent explanation for their observed properties. We estimate that the
fraction of radiated power that is converted into kinetic luminosity of the
outflowing winds is typically ~4 per cent, in agreement with recent estimates

lead to features in the primordial scalar spectrum are drawing increasing
attention, since certain features have been found to provide a better fit to
the CMB data than the conventional, nearly scale invariant, primordial
spectrum. In this work, we carry out a complete numerical analysis of two
models that lead to oscillations over all scales in the scalar power spectrum.
We consider the model described by a quadratic potential which is superposed by
a sinusoidal modulation and the recently popular axion monodromy model. Since
the oscillations continue even on to arc minute scales, in addition to the WMAP
data, we also compare the models with the small scale data from ACT. Though,
both the models, broadly, result in oscillations in the spectrum,
interestingly, we find that, while the monodromy model leads to a considerably
better fit to the data in comparison to the standard power law spectrum, the
quadratic potential superposed with a sinusoidal modulation does not improve
the fit to a similar extent. We also carry out forecasting of the parameters
using simulated Planck data for both the models. We show that the Planck mock
data performs better in constraining the model parameters as compared to the
presently available CMB datasets.

The observations clearly reveal the presence of considerable differential
extinction across the field. We characterise and quantify this effect using
young massive main sequence stars to derive a statistical reddening correction
for most objects in the field. We then search for pre-main sequence (PMS) stars
by looking for objects with a strong (> 4 sigma) Halpha excess emission and
find about 1150 of them over the entire field. Comparison of their location in
the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical PMS evolutionary tracks for
the appropriate metallicity reveals that about one third of these objects are
younger than ~4Myr, compatible with the age of the massive stars in the central
ionising cluster R136, whereas the rest have ages up to ~30Myr, with a median
age of ~12Myr. This indicates that star formation has proceeded over an
extended period of time, although we cannot discriminate between an extended
episode and a series of short and frequent bursts that are not resolved in
time. While the younger PMS population preferentially occupies the central
regions of the cluster, older PMS objects are more uniformly distributed across
the field and are remarkably few at the very centre of the cluster. We
attribute this latter effect to photoevaporation of the older circumstellar
discs caused by the massive ionising members of R136.

counter-orbiting material emerges naturally in tidal interactions of disc
galaxies. Model particles on both pro- and retrograde orbits can be formed as
tidal debris in single encounters with disc galaxies of 1-to-1 and 4-to-1 mass
ratios. A total of 74 model calculations are performed for a range of different
initial parameters. Interactions include fly-by and merger cases. The fraction
of counter-orbiting material produced varies over a wide range (from a few up
to 50 percent). All fly-by models show a similar two-phase behaviour, with
retrograde material forming first. Properties of the prograde and retrograde
populations are extracted to make an observational discrimination possible.
  During such encounters the tidal debris occupies a certain region in phase
space. In this material, tidal-dwarf galaxies may form. The modelling therefore
can explain why galaxies may have dwarf galaxies orbiting counter to the bulk
of their dwarf galaxies. An example is the Sculptor dwarf of the Milky Way,
which orbits counter to the bulk of the disc of satellites. The modelling thus
supports the scenario of the MW satellites being ancient tidal-dwarf galaxies
formed from gaseous material stripped from another galaxy during an encounter
with the young MW.
  A possible candidate for this galaxy is identified as the Magellanic Cloud
progenitor galaxy. Its angular motion fits the angular motion of the MW disc of
satellites objects. This scenario is in agreement with Lynden-Bell's original
suggestion for the origin of the dSph satellites and the near-unbound orbit of
the LMC.

systems with iron abundance less than 1/100 solar; observations of seven of
these are reported here for the first time. Together with recent measures of
the abundances of C and O in Galactic metal-poor stars, we reinvestigate the
trend of C/O in the very metal-poor regime and we compare, for the first time,
the O/Fe ratios in the most metal-poor DLAs and in halo stars. We confirm the
near-solar values of C/O in DLAs at the lowest metallicities probed, and find
that their distribution is in agreement with that seen in Galactic halo stars.
We find that the O/Fe ratio in very metal-poor (VMP) DLAs is essentially
constant, and shows very little dispersion, with a mean [<O/Fe>] = +0.39 +/-
0.12, in good agreement with the values measured in Galactic halo stars when
the oxygen abundance is measured from the [O I] 6300 line. We speculate that
such good agreement in the observed abundance trends points to a universal
origin for these metals. In view of this agreement, we construct the abundance
pattern for a typical very metal-poor DLA and compare it to model calculations
of Population II and Population III nucleosynthesis to determine the origin of
the metals in VMP DLAs. Our results suggest that the most metal-poor DLAs may
have been enriched by a generation of metal-free stars; however, given that
abundance measurements are currently available for only a few elements, we
cannot yet rule out an additional contribution from Population II stars.

effect of oscillations in the three-point function on the clustering of

dependence of the non-Gaussian halo bias. In this paper, we focus on models
displaying a sharp feature in the inflaton potential as well as Resonant
non-Gaussianity. In both cases, we find a strong scale dependence for the
non-Gaussian halo bias with a slope similar to that of the local model. In the
resonant case, we find that the non-Gaussian bias oscillates with halo mass, a
novel feature that is unique to this type of models. In the case of a sharp
feature in the inflaton potential, we find that the clustering of halos is
enhanced at the mass scale corresponding to the Fourier mode that exited the
horizon when the inflaton was crossing the feature in the potential. Both of
these are new effects that open the possibility of characterizing the
inflationary potential with large-scale-structure surveys. We briefly discuss
the prospects for detecting these non-Gaussian effects.

models of planet formation, evolution and structure, we explore the range of
minimum plausible masses for low-density exo-Neptunes. We focus on highly
irradiated planets with T_eq>=500K. We consider two separate formation pathways
for low-mass planets with voluminous atmospheres of light gases: core nucleated
accretion and outgassing of hydrogen from dissociated ices. We show that
Neptune-size planets at T_eq=500K with masses as small as a few times that of
Earth can plausibly be formed core nucleated accretion coupled with subsequent
inward migration. We also derive a limiting low-density mass-radius relation
for rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes but no surface water. Rocky
planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes typically have computed radii well
below 3 R_Earth. For both planets with H/He envelopes from core nucleated
accretion and planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes, we employ planet
interior models to map the range of planet mass--envelope mass--equilibrium
temperature parameter space that is consistent with Neptune-size planet radii.
Atmospheric mass loss mediates which corners of this parameter space are
populated by actual planets and ultimately governs the minimum plausible mass
at a specified transit radius. We find that Kepler's 2-6 R_Earth planet
candidates at T_eq=500--1000K could potentially have masses less than ~4
M_Earth. Although our quantitative results depend on several assumptions, our
qualitative finding that warm Neptune-size planets can have masses
substantially smaller than those given by interpolating the masses and radii of
planets within our Solar System is robust.

in a sample of 131 discrete HI-selected quasar absorbers with
\rho/\bar{\rho}>1.6, we derive a median carbon abundance of [C/H]=-3.55, with
lognormal scatter of approximately ~0.8 dex. This median value is a factor of
two to three lower than similar measurements made at z~2.4 using CIV and OVI.
The strength of evolution is modestly dependent on the choice of UV background
spectrum used to make ionization corrections, although our detection of an
abundance evolution is generally robust with respect to this model uncertainty.
We present a framework for analyzing the effects of spatial fluctuations in the
UV ionizing background at frequencies relevant for CIV production. We also
explore the effects of reduced flux between 3-4 Rydbergs (as from HeII Lyman
series absorption) on our abundance estimates. At HeII line absorption levels
similar to published estimates the effects are very small, although a larger
optical depth could reduce the strength of the abundance evolution. Our results
imply that ~50% of the heavy elements seen in the IGM at z~2.4 were deposited
in the 1.3 Gyr between z~4.3 and z~2.4. The total implied mass flux of carbon

in such an environment, a massive cloud with Tvir>10^4 K can contract
isothermally at 8000 K by Lyman alpha cooling. This cloud collapses
monolithically without fragmentation, and a supermassive star (>10^5 Msun) is
believed to form at the center, which eventually evolves to a supermassive
black hole (SMBH). However, candidates of FUV sources, including star-forming
galaxies, are probably sources of strong CRs and X-rays, as well. We find that
the external ionization promotes H2 production and elevates the threshold FUV
intensity Jcr needed for the SMBH formation for CR energy density U_CR>10^-14
erg/cm^3 or X-ray intensity J_X>10^-24 erg/s/cm^2/sr/Hz at 1 keV. The critical
FUV flux increases in proportion to U_CR^{1/2} (J_X^{1/2}) in the high CR
(X-ray, respectively) limit. With the same value of FUV intensity at the Lyman
limit (13.6 eV), the H^- photodissociation rate, with threshold of 0.755 eV,
increases and the H2 molecules decrease with decreasing effective temperature
of the FUV sources T*. The lower value of T* thus results in the lower critical
FUV flux at 13.6 eV. Using an empirical relation between intensities of FUV and
CR/X-ray from nearby star-forming galaxies, we find that external ionization
effect remarkably enhances the critical FUV flux for sources with T* as high as
10^5 K and composed of stars with <100 Msun to a level that is not realized in
any halo. This indicates that, to induce SMBH formation, the FUV sources must

field potential but through kinetic terms coupled to gravity. These derivative
couplings impose a shift symmetry on the scalar field, aiding naturalness. We
write the most general purely kinetic action not exceeding mass dimension six
and obeying second order field equations. The result reduces to a simple form
involving a coupling of the Einstein tensor with the kinetic term and can be
interpreted as adding a new term to Galileon gravity in curved spacetime. We
examine the cosmological implications of the effective dark energy and classify
the dynamical attractor solutions, finding a quasistable loitering phase
mimicking late time acceleration by a cosmological constant.

grow in linear size. This is because the brightness per unit area has a
distinct upper limit due to the self-regulating nature of star-formation. As a
corollary, we show that the observed increase in characteristic luminosity of
Lyman Break Galaxies (L*) with time can be explained by their increase in size,
which scales as 1/H(z). In contrast, Lyman-alpha selected galaxies have a
characteristic, constant, small size between redshift z=2.25 and 6.5. Coupled
with a characteristic surface brightness, this can explain their non-evolving
ultraviolet continuum luminosity function. This compact physical size seems to
be a critical determining factor in whether a galaxy will show Lyman-alpha
emission. We base these conclusions on new size measurements for a sample of
about 170 Lyman-alpha selected galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope broad-band
imaging, over the redshift range 2.25 < z < 6. We combine these with a similar
number of Lyman-alpha selected galaxies with half-light radii from the
literature, and derive surface brightnesses for the entire combined sample.

grown by the Bridgman-Stockbarger (BRST) technique, which were annealed to
display narrow superconducting transitions and the optimal transition
temperature $T_c \gtrsim 14$ K, with the diagram for samples of similar
stoichiometry grown by the traveling-solvent floating-zone technique as well as
with the phase-diagram reported for crystals grown by a self-flux method. We
find that the so-annealed samples tend to display higher ratios $H_{c2}/T_c$,
particularly for fields applied along the inter-planar direction, where the
upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$ exhibits a pronounced downward curvature
followed by saturation at lower temperatures $T$. This last observation is
consistent with previous studies indicating that this system is Pauli limited.
An analysis of our $H_{c2}(T)$ data using a multiband theory suggests the
emergence of the Farrel-Fulde-Larkin-Ovchnikov state at low temperatures. A
detailed structural x-ray analysis, reveals no impurity phases but an
appreciable degree of mosaicity in as-grown BRST single-crystals which remains
unaffected by the annealing process. Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis showed
that the annealed samples have a more homogeneous stoichiometric distribution
of both Fe and Se with virtually the same content of interstitial Fe as the
non-annealed ones. Thus, we conclude that stoichiometric disorder, in contrast
to structural disorder, is detrimental to the superconducting phase diagram of
this series under high magnetic fields. Finally, a scaling analysis of the
fluctuation conductivity in the superconducting critical regime, suggests that
the superconducting fluctuations have a two-dimensional character in this
system.

with nonnegative input, also known as the intensity-modulated direct-detection

optimization criteria are the average electrical, average optical, and peak
power. The nonnegative constraint on the input to the channel is translated
into a conical constraint in signal space, and modulation formats are designed
by sphere packing inside this cone. Some dense packings are found, which yield
more power-efficient modulation formats than previously known. For example, at
a spectral efficiency of 1.5 bit/s/Hz, the modulation format optimized for
average electrical power has a 2.55 dB average electrical power gain over the
best known format to achieve a symbol error rate of 10^-6. The corresponding
gains for formats optimized for average and peak optical power are 1.35 and
1.72 dB, respectively. Using modulation formats optimized for peak power in
average-power limited systems results in a smaller power penalty than when
using formats optimized for average power in peak-power limited systems. We
also evaluate the modulation formats in terms of their mutual information to
predict their performance in the presence of capacity-achieving error-
correcting codes, and finally show numerically and analytically that the
optimal modulation formats for reliable transmission in the wideband regime
have only one nonzero point.

the intergalactic UV background observationally by studying metal absorption
systems. We study single-component metal line systems exhibiting various
well-measured species. Among the observed transitions at least two ratios of
ionization stages from the same element are required, e.g. CIII/CIV and
SiIII/SiIV. For each system photoionization models are constructed varying the
spectrum of the ionizing radiation. The spectral energy distribution can then
be constrained by comparing the models with the observed column density ratios.
Extensive tests with artificial absorbers show that the spectrum of the
ionizing radiation cannot be reconstructed unambiguously, but it is possible to
constrain the main characteristics of the spectrum. Furthermore, the resulting
physical parameters of the absorber, such as ionization parameter, metallicity,
and relative abundances, may depend strongly on the adopted ionizing spectrum.
Even in case of well-fitting models the uncertainties can be as high as ~0.5
dex for the ionization parameter and up to ~1.5 dex for the metallicity.
Therefore, it is essential to know the hardness of the UV background when
estimating the metallicity of the intergalactic medium. Applying the procedure
to a small sample of 3 observed single-component metal line systems yields a
soft ionizing radiation at z > 2 and a slightly harder spectrum at z < 2. The
resulting energy distributions exhibit strong HeII Ly alpha re-emission
features suggesting that reprocessing by intergalactic HeII is important.
Comparing to UV background spectra from the literature indicates that the
recent model of Madau & Haardt (2009) including sawtooth modulation due to
reprocessing by intergalactic HeII with delayed helium reionization fits the
investigated systems very well.

$\sin^2 2\theta_{23}=1$ and $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}=0$, the expected number of
such events is 1.5$\pm$0.3(syst.). Under this hypothesis, the probability to
observe six or more candidate events is 7$\times10^{-3}$, equivalent to
2.5$\sigma$ significance. At 90% C.L., the data are consistent with
0.03(0.04)$<\sin^2 2\theta_{13}<$ 0.28(0.34) for $\delta_{\rm CP}=0$ and a

energy density in their core reaches that of the prior symmetric vacuum) but
topologically stable (the whole manifold would have to be rearranged to get rid
of the defect). We show how, in a paradigmatic model of a quantum phase
transition, a topological defect can be put in a non-local superposition, so
that - in a region large compared to the size of its core - the order parameter
of the system is ""undecided"" by being in a quantum superposition of conflicting

predict astrophysical parameters for the vast numbers of astrophysical sources

training data often manifest as strongly biased predictions on the data of
interest. Typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys of
brighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive, deeper surveys
(testing data). This sample selection bias can cause catastrophic errors in
predictions on the testing data because a) standard assumptions for
machine-learned model selection procedures break down and b) dense regions of
testing space might be completely devoid of training data. We explore possible
remedies to sample selection bias, including importance weighting (IW),
co-training (CT), and active learning (AL). We argue that AL---where the data
whose inclusion in the training set would most improve predictions on the
testing set are queried for manual follow-up---is an effective approach and is
appropriate for many astronomical applications. For a variable star
classification problem on a well-studied set of stars from Hipparcos and OGLE,
AL is the optimal method in terms of error rate on the testing data, beating
the off-the-shelf classifier by 3.4% and the other proposed methods by at least
3.0%. To aid with manual labeling of variable stars, we developed a web
interface which allows for easy light curve visualization and querying of
external databases. Finally, we apply active learning to classify variable
stars in the ASAS survey, finding dramatic improvement in our agreement with
the ACVS catalog, from 65.5% to 79.5%, and a significant increase in the

stellar objects. Stars of spectral type A and B are called Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe)
stars in this stage, all later spectral types are termed classical T Tauri
stars (CTTS). Both types are studied by high-resolution X-ray and UV
spectroscopy and modeling. Three mechanisms contribute to the high-energy
emission from CTTS: 1) CTTS have active coronae similar to main-sequence stars,
2) the accreted material passes through an accretion shock at the stellar
surface, which heats it to a few MK, and 3) some CTTS drive powerful outflows.
Shocks within these jets can heat the plasma to X-ray emitting temperatures.
Coronae are already well characterized in the literature; for the latter two
scenarios models are shown. The magnetic field suppresses motion perpendicular
to the field lines in the accretion shock, thus justifying a 1D geometry. The
radiative loss is calculated as optically thin emission. A mixture of shocked
and coronal gas is fitted to X-ray observations of accreting CTTS.
Specifically, the model explains the peculiar line-ratios in the He-like
triplets of Ne IX and O VII. All stars require only small mass accretion rates
to power the X-ray emission. In contrast, the HAeBe HD 163296 has line ratios
similar to coronal sources, indicating that neither a high density nor a strong
UV-field is present in the region of the X-ray emission. This could be caused
by a shock in its jet. Similar emission is found in the deeply absorbed CTTS DG
Tau. Shock velocities between 400 and 500 km/s are required to explain the
observed spectrum.

considering the effect of dynamical gauge boson mass generation. The effective
confining propagator has the form $1/(k^2+m^2)^2$ and we study the bifurcation
equation finding limits on $m$ below which a satisfactory fermion mass solution
is generated. Since the coupling constant and gauge boson propagator are damped
in the infrared, due to the presence of dynamically massive gauge bosons, the
major part of the chiral breaking is only due to the confining propagator. We
study the asymptotic behavior of the gap equation containing confinement and
massive gauge boson exchange, and find that the symmetry breaking can be
approximated at some extent by an effective four-fermion interaction generated
by the confining propagator. We compute some QCD chiral parameters as a
function of $m$, finding values compatible with the experimental data. Within
this approach we expect that lattice simulations should not see large
differences between the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking scales

such as the infinities encountered in the existing theories of elementary
particles, suggest a different approach to the study of these particles.
Instead of restricting ourselves to the concept of point-like particles, we
should extend our investigation to the implication of the concept of particles
having infinite extension. Such a particle should consist of a continuous
distribution of energy over all space, the energy density tending to zero at
infinity. To achieve this aim, we introduce into the theory of general
relativity the postulate that the gravitational, electric and nuclear fields
are special cases of a more general field. An expression is obtained for the
gravitational potential which differs from the usual expression of the
potential accepted in general relatvity, and which gives an energy density for
the particle at every point of space, the integral of which over all space is
equal to the mass of the particle, the greatest part of the mass being
concentrated near the center of the spherical pattern constituting the
particle. The particle is thus seen to consist of the energy of its field. No
infinities are encountered in the integrations. The same result is obtained for
a charged particle. The charge density is spread out over all space and the
integrals of the charge density and energy density are respectively equal to
the charge and mass of the particle. The electric potential this obtained is
inserted in Dirac's wave equation, and gives a series of equations of
increasing degree, the first of which gives the mass of the muon. When inserted
in Dirac's wave equation, this potential gives the values of the masses of
baryons. When inserted in the Klein-Gordon equation, this potential gives the
values of the masses of mesons.

observations and theories predicted by the standard paradigm of cold dark
matter (CDM) cosmology. To solve this problem, we perform N-body simulations to
study the nonlinear response of CDM halos to the variance of the gravitational
potential induced by gas removal from galaxy centers. In this study, we focus
on the timescale of the gas ejection, which is strongly correlated with stellar
activities, and demonstrate that it is one of the key factors in determining
the dynamical response of CDM halos. The results of simulations show that the
power-low index of the mass-density profile of the dark matter halo correlated
with the timescale of the mass loss, and it is flatter when the mass loss
occurs over a short time than when it occurs over a long time. However, it is
still larger than typical observational values; in other words, the central
cusp remains for any mass loss model in the simulations. Moreover, for the slow
mass-loss case, the final density profile of the dark matter halo recovers the
universal density profiles predicted by the CDM cosmology. Therefore, mass loss
driven by stellar feedback may not be an effective mechanism to flatten the
central cusp.

temperature in this paper. The first one is the energy-kick (EK) method. To
apply this method, one adds an external energy kick to a particle in the
lattice, and tracks its evolution by evolving the kicked system. The second one
is the fluctuation-correlation (FC) method. The formula for calculating the
probability density function (PDF) using the canonical ensemble is slightly
revised and extended to the microcanonical ensemble. We show that the FC method
has advantages over the EK method theoretically and technically. Theoretically,
the PDF obtained by the FC method reveals the diffusion processes of the inner
energy while the PDF obtained by the EK method represents that of the kick
energy. The diffusion processes of the inner energy and the external energy
added to the system, i.e., the kick energy, may be different quantitatively and
even qualitatively depending on models. To show these facts, we study not only
the equilibrium systems but also the stationary nonequilibrium systems.
Examples showing that the inner energy and the kick energy may have different
diffusion behavior are reported in both cases. The technical advantage enables
us to study the long-time diffusion processes and thus avoids the finite-time
effect.

provides a new estimate of dependence parameters of bivariate statistical data.
Consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator are established.
Extensive simulation study is carried out to compare estimators based on the
BLM, the maximum likelihood, the minimum distance and rank approximate
Z-estimation. The obtained results show that, when the sample size increases,
BLM-based estimation performs better as far as the bias and computation time
are concerned. Moreover, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is quite reasonable
and less sensitive in general to outliers than those of the above cited

is called synaptic depression, a short term synaptic plasticity. Many
researchers have investigated how the synaptic depression affects the memory
storage capacity. However, the noise has not been taken into consideration in

depression on the memory storage capacity in the presence of the noise. We
analytically compute the storage capacity by using a statistical mechanics

the synaptic depression decreases the storage capacity in the case of finite

of heat and momentum may represent the heat mode and the sound mode in the
hydrodynamic theory. In addition, the dynamic structure factor, which describes
the diffusion behavior of local mass density fluctuations, is in general
insufficient for probing diffusion processes of other quantities because in
some cases there is no correlation between them. We also find that the
diffusion behavior of heat can be qualitatively different from that of energy,
and, as a result, previous studies trying to relate heat conduction to energy

highest available astrometric precision, using a Keck-II adaptive-optics image.
The available early-time spectra and photometry indicate that the SN is a
stripped-envelope, core-collapse Type IIb, with a more compact progenitor
(radius ~1e11 cm) than was the case for the well-studied SN IIb 1993J. We infer
that the extinction to SN 2011dh and its progenitor arises from a low Galactic

metallicity. The detected object has absolute magnitude M_V^0 ~ -7.7 and
effective temperature ~6000 K. The star's radius, ~1e13 cm, is more extended
than what has been inferred for the SN progenitor. We speculate that the
detected star is either an unrelated star very near the position of the actual
progenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor's companion in a mass-transfer
binary system. The position of the detected star in a Hertzsprung-Russell

for 30 galaxies covering a wider range of galactic luminosity (and central
velocity dispersion sigma_c) than before. This work investigates the origin of
the observed temperatures, by examining the relationship between them and the
galaxy structure, the gas heating due to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa's) and the
gravitational potential, and the dynamical status of the gas flow. In galaxies
with sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for
the gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower
than this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow
status; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for
infall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be
dominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to
~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest
galaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower
than in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by
SNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value
at the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce
temperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The
values of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is
relatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial
temperature. For 200<sigma_c(km/s)<250, lower L_X values tend to correspond to
lower T's, which deserves further investigation.

caused by the lensing by known populations of stars, therefore we concluded
that there is no need for introducing any special dark matter compact objects
in order to explain the observed events rates. Potential black hole event
indicates that similar lenses can contribute only about 2 per cent to the total
mass of the halo, which is still in agreement with the expected number of such

Deviations of $\kappa \sigma^{2}$ and $S \sigma$ for the Au+Au collisions at

physical limits, emerging technologies driven by novel materials are becoming
an attractive option for future memory architectures. Among these technologies,
Resistive Memories (ReRAM) created new possibilities because of their
nano-features and unique $I$-$V$ characteristics. One particular problem that
limits the maximum array size is interference from neighboring cells due to
sneak-path currents. A possible device level solution to address this issue is
to implement a memory array using complementary resistive switches (CRS).
Although the storage mechanism for a CRS is fundamentally different from what
has been reported for memristors (low and high resistances), a CRS is simply
formed by two series bipolar memristors with opposing polarities. In this paper
our intention is to introduce modeling principles that have been previously
verified through measurements and extend the simulation principles based on
memristors to CRS devices and hence provide an analytical approach to the
design of a CRS array. The presented approach creates the necessary design
methodology platform that will assist designers in implementation of CRS
devices in future systems.

by creation operators $\partial_t^\dag$ and annihilation operators

point of view of physics, the most important case of a generalized statistics
is the anyon statistics, for which $Q(s,t)$ is equal to $q$ if $s<t$, and to
$\bar q$ if $s>t$. Here $q\in\mathbb C$, $|q|=1$. We start the paper with a
detailed discussion of a $Q$-Fock space and operators
$(\partial_t^\dag,\partial_t)_{t\in T}$ in it, which satisfy the
$Q$-commutation relations. Next, we consider a noncommutative stochastic
process (white noise)

independence for a generalized statistics, and to derive corresponding L\'evy

$(\xi(t))_{t\in T}$ whose values at different points of $T$ are $Q$-independent
and which possesses a stationarity of increments (in a certain sense). We
present an explicit construction of a $Q$-L\'evy process, and derive a

velocity of the planetary and stellar material is supersonic. We aim to
reproduce this observed early ingress by modelling the stellar wind (or coronal
plasma) in order to derive the speed and density of the material at the

black hole binaries among z < 0.7 SDSS quasars Such binaries are predicted by
models of supermassive black hole and host galaxy co-evolution, therefore their
census and population properties constitute an important test of these models.
We used an automatic technique based on spectroscopic principal component
analysis to search for broad H-beta lines that are displaced from the
rest-frame of the quasar by more than 1,000 km/s This method can also yield
candidates for rapidly recoiling black holes. Our search yielded 88 candidates,
several of which were previously identified and discussed in the literature.
The widths of the broad H-beta lines are typical among quasars but the shifts
are extreme. We found a correlation between the peak offset and skewness of the
broad H-beta profiles, which suggests that the profiles we have selected share
a common physical explanation. The general properties of the narrow emission
lines are typical of quasars. We carried out followup spectroscopic
observations of 68 objects to search for changes in the peak velocities of the
H-beta lines (the time interval in the observer's frame between the original
and new observations is 1-10 yr). We measured significant changes in 14
objects, with resulting accelerations between -120 and +120 km/s/yr. We
emphasize that interpretation of the offset broad emission lines as signatures
of supermassive binaries is subject to many significant caveats. Many more
followup observations over a long temporal baseline are needed to characterize
the variability pattern of the broad lines and test that this pattern is indeed
consistent with orbital motion. The possibility that some of the objects in
this sample are rapidly recoiling black holes remains open as the available
data do not provide strong constraints for this scenario.

stability of its roman walls and foundations and its suitable dimension.
Stability over centuries of the ancient walls where the pinhole is located is a
requirement for making high precision astrometry, such as the measurement of
the inclination of the Earth axis over its orbit plan. In the 18th century it
was possible to open the window holding the southern pinhole, and, even in
daylight, stellar transits were recorded and precisely timed with pendulum
mechanical clocks. The accuracy of such clocks was better than 1 s per day, and
the observations of stellar transits allowed their synchronization with
sidereal time. This ""hybrid feature"" of the Clementine Gnomon to measure solar
and stellar transits allowed Bianchini to accomplish in 1703 the whole
measurement of the duration of the tropical year, which was usually made by
comparing observations very widely spread in time. The small deviation of the
Line from true North of ~ 4'30"" Eastwards has been measured comparing the
delays of transits at both solstices with respect to the ephemerides.

conventional subspace-based channel estimation for single-input multiple-output
(SIMO) flat-fading channels employing binary phase-shift-keying (BPSK)
modulation when the covariance matrix is estimated using a finite number of
samples. The conventional estimator suffers from a phase ambiguity that reduces
to a sign ambiguity for the WL estimator. We derive closed-form expressions for
the MSE of the two estimators under four different ambiguity resolution
scenarios. The first scenario is optimal resolution, which minimizes the
Euclidean distance between the channel estimate and the actual channel. The
second scenario assumes that a randomly chosen coefficient of the actual
channel is known and the third assumes that the one with the largest magnitude
is known. The fourth scenario is the more realistic case where pilot symbols
are used to resolve the ambiguities. Our work demonstrates that there is a
strong relationship between the accuracy of ambiguity resolution and the
relative performance of WL and conventional subspace-based estimators, and
shows that the less information available about the actual channel for
ambiguity resolution, or the lower the accuracy of this information, the higher
the performance gap in favor of the WL estimator.

crosslinkers that do not. The framework consists of numerical simulations and
an effective medium theory on a percolating triangular lattice. We find that
the introduction of angle-constraining crosslinkers significantly lowers the
filament concentrations required for these networks to attain mechanical
integrity. This cooperative effect also enhances the stiffness of the network
and suppresses non-affine deformations at a fixed filament concentration. We
further find that semiflexible networks with only freely-rotating crosslinks
are mechanically very similar to compositely crosslinked flexible networks with
both networks exhibiting the same scaling behavior. We show that the network
mechanics can either be redundant or cooperative depending on the relative
energy scale of filament bending to the energy stored in the angle-constraining
crosslinkers, and the relative concentration of crosslinkers. Our results may

to a variety of abnormal phenotypes including increased proliferation and
survival of somatic cells, and thus, to a selective advantage of pre-cancerous
cells. The notion of cancer progression as an evolutionary process has been
experiencing increasing interest in recent years. Many efforts have been made
to better understand and predict the progression to cancer using mathematical
models; these mostly consider the evolution of a well-mixed cell population,
even though pre-cancerous cells often evolve in highly structured epithelial
tissues. We propose a novel model of cancer progression that considers a
spatially structured cell population where clones expand via adaptive waves.
This model is used to asses two different paradigms of asexual evolution that
have been suggested to delineate the process of cancer progression. The
standard scenario of periodic selection assumes that driver mutations are
accumulated strictly sequentially over time. However, when the mutation supply
is sufficiently high, clones may arise simultaneously on distinct genetic
backgrounds, and clonal adaptation waves interfere with each other. We find
that in the presence of clonal interference, spatial structure increases the
waiting time for cancer, leads to a patchwork structure of non-uniformly sized
clones, decreases the survival probability of virtually neutral (passenger)
mutations, and that genetic distance begins to increase over a characteristic
length scale, determined here. These characteristic features of clonal
interference may help to predict the onset of cancers with pronounced spatial
structure and to interpret spatially-sampled genetic data obtained from
biopsies. Our estimates suggest that clonal interference likely occurs in the
progressing colon cancer, and possibly other cancers where spatial structure
matters.

longitudinal field varies in a manner consistent with the spectroscopic period
of 537.6 d, in an approximately sinusoidal fashion. This demonstrates a firm
connection between the magnetic field and the processes responsible for the
line and continuum variability. Interpreting the variation of the longitudinal
magnetic field within the context of the dipole oblique rotator model we obtain
a best-fit surface magnetic field model with obliquity beta=67\pm 5 deg and
polar strength Bd=2450\pm 400 G . The inferred magnetic field strength implies
an equatorial wind magnetic confinement parameter eta*~50, supporting a picture
in which the Halpha emission and photometric variability have their origin in
an oblique, rigidly rotating magnetospheric structure resulting from a
magnetically channeled wind. This interpretation is supported by our successful
Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling of the photometric variation, which
assumes the enhanced plasma densities in the magnetic equatorial plane above
the star implied by such a picture. Predictions of the continuum linear
polarisation resulting from Thompson scattering from the magnetospheric
material indicate that the Stokes Q and U variations are highly sensitive to
the magnetospheric geometry, and that expected amplitudes are in the range of
current instrumentation. (abridged)
