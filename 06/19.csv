argued, contrary to a very widely held belief, that the solution contains a
black hole in an expanding universe. Here we corroborate their main conclusion
but go on to examine, in some detail, a specific solution that asymptotes to
the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We show that part of the boundary of the solution
contains the inner bifurcation two - sphere of the Schwarzschild - de Sitter
spacetime and so both the black and white hole horizons together form a partial
boundary of this McVittie solution. We go on to show that the null and weak
energy conditions are satisfied and that the dominant energy condition is
satisfied almost everywhere in the solution. The solution is understood here by
way of a systematic construction of a conformal diagram based on detailed
numerical integrations of the null geodesic equations. We find that the
McVittie solution admits a degenerate limit in which the bifurcation two -
sphere disappears. For solutions with zero cosmological constant, we find no
evidence for the development of a weak null singularity. Rather, we find that
in this case there is either a black hole to the future of an initial
singularity or a white hole to its past.

uniform, all-sky catalogue of bright sources with flux density measurements at
high (up to 94 GHz) radio frequencies. We investigated the five-year WMAP list
to compile a new catalogue of bright and compact extragalactic radio sources to
be potentially studied with Very Long Baseline Interferometry at millimeter
wavelengths (mm-VLBI) and Space VLBI (SVLBI). After comparing the WMAP data
with the existing mm-VLBI catalogues, we sorted out the yet unexplored sources.
Using the 41, 61 and 94 GHz WMAP flux densities, we calculated the spectral
indices. By collecting optical identifications, lower-frequency radio flux
densities and VLBI images from the literature, we created a list of objects
which have not been investigated with VLBI at 86 GHz before. With total flux
density at least 1 Jy and declination above -40 degree, we found 37 suitable
new targets. It is a nearly 25% addition to the known mm-VLBI sources. Such
objects are also potentially useful as phase-reference calibrators for the
future Japanese SVLBI mission ASTRO-G at its highest observing frequency (43
GHz). The phase-referencing capability of ASTRO-G would allow long integrations
and hence better sensitivity for observing faint target sources close to
suitable phase calibrators in the sky.

functional, $\mathcal{G}[n]$, valid for the single impurity Anderson model at
zero temperature. The functional is special because it does not depend on the
interaction strength $U$. As a consequence, the Landauer conductance for the
Kohn-Sham (KS) particles of density functional theory (DFT) coincides with the
true conductance of the interacting system. The argument breaks down at
temperatures above the Kondo scale, near integer filling,
$n_{\text{d}\sigma}\approx 1/2$ for spins $\sigma{=}\uparrow\downarrow$. Here,
the true conductance is strongly suppressed by the Coulomb blockade, while the
KS-conductance still indicates resonant transport. Conclusions of our analysis
are corroborated by DFT studies with numerically exact exchange-correlation
functionals reconstructed from calculations employing the density matrix
renormalization group.

linear refractive index and weak Kerr nonlinearity. In this context, wave
packet initial conditions with a single carrier frequency excite infinitely
many resonances. On large but finite time-scales, the coupled evolution of
backward and forward waves is governed by nonlocal equations of resonant
nonlinear geometrical optics. For the special class of solutions which are
periodic in the fast phase, these equations are equivalent to an infinite
system of nonlinear coupled mode equations, the so called it extended nonlinear
coupled mode equations, xNLCME. Numerical studies support the existence of
long-lived spatially localized coherent structures, featuring a slowly varying
envelope and a train of carrier shocks.
  In this paper we explore, by analytical, asymptotic and numerical methods,
the existence and properties of spatially localized structures of the xNLCME
system, which arises for a refractive index profile consisting of periodic
array of Dirac delta functions.
  We consider the limit of small amplitude solutions with frequencies near a
band-edge. In this case, stationary xNLCME is well-approximated by an infinite
system of coupled, stationary, nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations, the extended
nonlinear Schr\""odinger system, xNLS. We embed xNLS in a one-parameter family
of equations, xNLS$^\epsilon$, which interpolates between infinitely many
decoupled NLS equations ($\epsilon=0$) and xNLS ($\epsilon=1$). Using
bifurcation methods we show existence of solutions for a range of
$\epsilon\in(-\epsilon_0,\epsilon_0)$ and, by a numerical continuation method,
establish the continuation of certain branches all the way to $\epsilon=1$.
Finally, we perform time-dependent simulations of truncated xNLCME and find the
small-amplitude solitons to be robust to both numerical errors and the NLS
approximation.

and non-symmetric linear systems. In theory, it is a method that lies between
the well-known BiCGStab and GMRES/FOM. In fact, when n = 1, ML(1)BiCGStab is
BiCGStab and when n = N, ML(N)BiCGStab is GMRES/FOM where N is the size of the
linear system. Therefore, ML(n)BiCGStab is a bridge that connects the
Lanczos-based BiCGStab and the Arnoldi-based GMRES/FOM. In computation,
ML(n)BiCGStab can be much more stable and converge much faster than BiCGStab
when a problem with ill-condition is solved. We have tested ML(n)BiCGStab on
the standard oil reservoir simulation test data called SPE9 and found that
ML(n)BiCGStab reduced the total computational time by more than 60% when
compared to BiCGStab. Tests made on the data from Matrix Market also support
the superiority of ML(n)BiCGStab over BiCGStab. Because of the O(N^2) storage
requirement in the full GMRES, one has to adopt a restart strategy to get the
storage under control when GMRES is implemented. In comparison, ML(n)BiCGStab
is a method with only O(nN) storage requirement and therefore it does not need
a restart strategy. In this paper, we introduce ML(n)BiCGStab (in particular, a
new algorithm involving A-transpose), its relations to some existing methods
and its implementations.

propose quadrature mirror filters (referred to as graph-QMF) for bipartite

probability density function of the particle concentration. The clustering
statistics depend on the Stokes number, $St$, defined as the ratio of the
particle friction timescale, $\tau_{\rm p} $, to the Kolmogorov timescale in
the flow. In the dissipation range, the clustering intensity strongly peaks at
$St \simeq 1$, and the RDF for $St \sim 1$ shows a fast power-law increase
toward small scales, suggesting that turbulent clustering may considerably
enhance the particle collision rate. Clustering at inertial-range scales is of
particular interest to the problem of planetesimal formation. At these scales,
the strongest clustering is from particles with $\tau_{\rm p}$ in the inertial
range. Clustering of these particles occurs primarily around a scale where the
eddy turnover time is $\sim\tau_{\rm p}$. Particles of different sizes tend to
cluster at different locations, leading to flat RDFs between different
particles at small scales. In the presence of multiple particle sizes, the
overall clustering strength decreases as the particle size distribution
broadens. We discuss particle clustering in recent models for planetesimal
formation. We point out that, in the model based on turbulent clustering of
chondrule-size particles, the probability of finding strong clusters that can
seed planetesimals may have been significantly overestimated. We discuss
various clustering mechanisms in simulations of planetesimal formation by
gravitational collapse of dense clumps of meter-size particles, in particular

flames are inherently unstable to DDT. The associated mechanism, based on the
nonsteady evolution of flames faster than the Chapman-Jouguet deflagrations, is
qualitatively different from the traditionally suggested spontaneous reaction

turbulent flame speed, S_T, in the thin reaction zone regime. High intensity
turbulence is considered with the r.m.s. velocity 35 times the laminar flame
speed, S_L, resulting in the Damkohler number Da = 0.05. Here we show that: (1)
The flame brush has a complex internal structure, in which the isosurfaces of
higher fuel mass fractions are folded on progressively smaller scales. (2)
Global properties of the turbulent flame are best represented by the structure
of the region of peak reaction rate, which defines the flame surface. (3) In
the thin reaction zone regime, S_T is predominantly determined by the increase
of the flame surface area, A_T, caused by turbulence. (4) The observed increase
of S_T relative to S_L exceeds the corresponding increase of A_T relative to
the surface area of the planar laminar flame, on average, by ~14%, varying from
only a few percent to ~30%. (5) This exaggerated response is the result of
tight flame packing by turbulence, which causes frequent flame collisions and
formation of regions of high flame curvature, or ""cusps."" (6) The local flame
speed in the cusps substantially exceeds its laminar value, which results in a
disproportionately large contribution of cusps to S_T compared with the flame
surface area in them. (7) A criterion is established for transition to the
regime significantly influenced by cusp formation. In particular, at Karlovitz
numbers Ka > 20, flame collisions provide an important mechanism controlling
S_T, in addition to the increase of A_T by large-scale motions and the
potential enhancement of diffusive transport by small-scale turbulence.

tightly folded flamelets. The reaction zone structure of these is virtually
identical to that of the planar laminar flame, while the preheat zone is
broadened by approximately a factor of two. Consequently, the system evolution
represents turbulent combustion in the thin-reaction zone regime. The turbulent
cascade fails to penetrate the internal flame structure, and thus the action of
small-scale turbulence is suppressed throughout most of the flame. Finally, our
results suggest that for stoichiometric H2-air mixtures, any substantial flame
broadening by the action of turbulence cannot be expected in all subsonic
regimes.

concepts in the physics of Fe - based high-temperature superconductors. We
compare LDA and ARPES data on the band structure and Fermi surfaces of novel
superconductors and those of the previously studied FeAs superconductors,
especially isostructural 122 - superconductors like BaFe_2As_2. It appears that
electronic structure of new superconductors is rather different from that of
FeAs 122 - systems. In particular, no nesting properties of electron and hole -
like Fermi surfaces is observed, casting doubts on most popular theoretical
schemes of Cooper pairing for these systems. The discovery of Fe vacancies
ordering and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at pretty high temperatures (T_N>
500 K), much exceeding superconducting T_c makes these systems unique
antiferromagnetic superconductors with highest T_N observed up to now. We
discuss the role of both vacancies and AFM ordering in transformations of band
structure and Fermi surfaces, as well as their importance for
superconductivity. In particular, we show that system remains metallic with
unfolded Fermi surfaces quite similar to that in paramagnetic state.
Superconducting transition temperature T_c of new superconductors is discussed
within the general picture of superconductivity in multiple band systems. It is
demonstrated that both in FeAs - superconductors and in new FeSe - systems the
value of T_c correlates with the value of the total density of states (DOS) at
the Fermi level.

flow} conducts the natural gradient ascent of an adaptive, time-dependent,
quantile-based transformation of the objective function. It makes no
assumptions on the objective function to be optimized.
  The IGO method produces explicit IGO algorithms through time discretization.
It naturally recovers versions of known algorithms and offers a systematic way
to derive new ones. The cross-entropy method is recovered in a particular case,
and can be extended into a smoothed, parametrization-independent maximum
likelihood update (IGO-ML). For Gaussian distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, IGO
is related to natural evolution strategies (NES) and recovers a version of the
CMA-ES algorithm. For Bernoulli distributions on $\{0,1\}^d$, we recover the
PBIL algorithm. From restricted Boltzmann machines, we obtain a novel algorithm
for optimization on $\{0,1\}^d$. All these algorithms are unified under a
single information-geometric optimization framework.
  Thanks to its intrinsic formulation, the IGO method achieves invariance under
reparametrization of the search space $X$, under a change of parameters of the
probability distributions, and under increasing transformations of the
objective function.
  Theory strongly suggests that IGO algorithms have minimal loss in diversity
during optimization, provided the initial diversity is high. First experiments
using restricted Boltzmann machines confirm this insight. Thus IGO seems to
provide, from information theory, an elegant way to spontaneously explore
several valleys of a fitness landscape in a single run.

thus its physical properties. Seismology of Jupiter has been considered since

best, to ambiguous results. We report the detection of global modes of Jupiter,
based on radial velocity measurements performed with the SYMPA Fourier

point out that not all physical errors on physical qudits appear as linear
completely-positive trace-preserving errors in a correlation space. Since the
theories of fault-tolerant quantum circuits known so far assume such noises,
this means that the simulation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits in a

chemically peculiar stars develop ideal conditions for the appearance of
abundance anomalies through the mechanism of microscopic particle diffusion.
This makes these objects look spectroscopically and photometrically different
from their ""normal"" analogs. As a result, it is often difficult to accurately
determine atmospheric parameters of these stars and special methods are needed
for the consistent analysis of their atmospheres. The main aim of the present
paper is to analyse atmospheric abundance and stratification of chemical
elements in the atmosphere of the chemically peculiar star HD 103498. We find
that two model atmospheres computed with individual and stratified abundances
provide reasonable fit to observed spectroscopic and photometric indicators:
Teff=9300 K, logg=3.5 and Teff=9500K, logg=3.6. It is shown that Mg has a large
abundance gradient in the star's atmosphere with accumulation of Mg ions in the
uppermost atmospheric layers, whereas Si demonstrates opposite behaviour with
accumulation in deep layers. In addition, a detailed non-LTE analysis showed
that none of Mg transitions under consideration is a subject of noticeable
non-LTE effects. Comparing observed photometry transformed to physical units we
estimated the radius of HD 103498 to be between R=(4.56 +/- 0.77)Rsun for
Teff=9300K, logg=3.5 and R=(4.39 +/- 0.75)Rsun for Teff=9500K, logg=3.6 models

the crucial parameter to determine the parameters of the nuclear potential and

connection with thermodynamics in view of the cosmic censorship conjecture and
the validity of the third law of black hole mechanics.

  Multi-dimensional interpolation on a grid is one of hosts of semi-recursive

vaguely recursive terms, cannot be implemented as a recursion in their
structural entirety.
  This article describes a computer-implemented scheme for isolating the
recursive core of interpolation on a multi-grid, an arrangement that both stems
from and provides a structural framework to a number of multi-dimensional
interpolation optimization techniques that, once implemented, provide gains in
multi-dimensional interpolation speed that, compared to some known benchmarks,

need to be used. All these methods can be generally divided into two classes.
The first ones aim at providing individual data anonymity, whereas the other

source-to-target tgds (st-tgds), can be specified by a second-order tgd (SO
tgd). We consider the question of what happens when target constraints are
allowed. Specifically, we consider the question of specifying the composition
of standard schema mappings (those specified by st-tgds, target egds, and a
weakly acyclic set of target tgds). We show that SO tgds, even with the
assistance of arbitrary source constraints and target constraints, cannot
specify in general the composition of two standard schema mappings. Therefore,
we introduce source-to-target second-order dependencies (st-SO dependencies),
which are similar to SO tgds, but allow equations in the conclusion. We show
that st-SO dependencies (along with target egds and target tgds) are sufficient
to express the composition of every finite sequence of standard schema
mappings, and further, every st-SO dependency specifies such a composition. In
addition to this expressive power, we show that st-SO dependencies enjoy other
desirable properties. In particular, they have a polynomial-time chase that
generates a universal solution. This universal solution can be used to find the
certain answers to unions of conjunctive queries in polynomial time. It is easy
to show that the composition of an arbitrary number of standard schema mappings
is equivalent to the composition of only two standard schema mappings. We show
that surprisingly, the analogous result holds also for schema mappings
specified by just st-tgds (no target constraints). This is proven by showing
that every SO tgd is equivalent to an unnested SO tgd (one where there is no
nesting of function symbols). Similarly, we prove unnesting results for st-SO
dependencies, with the same types of consequences.

We then present a new strategy to defend security protocols, based on active

merging the three dimensions of space with an imaginary time dimension $ i c t

t^2 $, and the results of Einstein's then recently developed theory of special
relativity, thus providing an explanation for Einstein's theory in terms of the
structure of space and time. As an alternative to a planar Minkowski space-time
of two space dimensions and one time dimension, we replace the unit imaginary $
i = \sqrt{-1} $, with the Clifford bivector $ \iota = e_1 e_2 $ for the plane
that also squares to minus one, but which can be included without the addition
of an extra dimension, as it is an integral part of the real Cartesian plane
with the orthonormal basis $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $. We find that with this model of
planar spacetime, using a two-dimensional Clifford multivector, the spacetime
metric and the Lorentz transformations follow immediately as properties of the
algebra. This also leads to momentum and energy being represented as components
of a multivector and we give a new efficient derivation of Compton's scattering
formula, and a simple formulation of Dirac's and Maxwell's equations. Based on
the mathematical structure of the multivector, we produce a semi-classical
model of massive particles, which can then be viewed as the origin of the
Minkowski spacetime structure and thus a deeper explanation for relativistic
effects. We also find a new perspective on the nature of time, which is now
given a precise mathematical definition as the bivector of the plane.

compositional and morphological evolution over a long span of time (three
years) due to exposure to ambient atmosphere. It is concluded that the
mechanism proceeds in two steps. In the first step, the shell of ZnO forms over
Zn NCs rapidly up to certain limiting thickness: with in few days -- depending
upon the size -- Zn NCs are converted to Zn-ZnO (core-shell), Zn-void-ZnO, or
hollow ZnO type NCs. Bigger than ~15 nm become Zn-ZnO (core-shell) type: among
them, NCs above ~25 nm could able to retain their initial geometrical shapes
(namely triangular, hexagonal, rectangular and rhombohedral), but ~25 to 15 nm
size NCs become irregular or distorted geometrical shapes. NCs between ~15 to 5
nm become Zn-void-ZnO type, and smaller than ~5 nm become ZnO hollow sphere
type i.e. ZnO hollow NCs. In the second step, all Zn-void-ZnO and Zn-ZnO
(core-shell) structures are converted to hollow ZnO NCs in a slow and gradual
process, and the mechanism of conversion proceeds through expansion in size by
incorporating ZnO monomers inside the shell. The observed oxidation behaviour
of NCs is compared with theory of Cabrera - Mott on low-temperature oxidation
of metal.

characteristics of a family of linear operators, the joint spectral radius (in
short JSR) and the lower spectral radius (in short LSR), which are well-known
different generalizations to a set of operators of the usual spectral radius of
a linear operator. In this article we develop a method which - under suitable
assumptions - allows to compute the JSR and the LSR of a finite family of
matrices exactly. We remark that so far no algorithm was available in the
literature to compute the LSR exactly.
  The paper presents necessary theoretical results on extremal norms (and on
extremal antinorms) of linear operators, which constitute the basic tools of
our procedures, and a detailed description of the corresponding algorithms for
the computation of the JSR and LSR (the last one restricted to families sharing
an invariant cone). The algorithms are easily implemented and their
descriptions are short.
  If the algorithms terminate in finite time, then they construct an extremal
norm (in the JSR case) or antinorm (in the LSR case) and find their exact
values; otherwise they provide upper and lower bounds that both converge to the
exact values. A theoretical criterion for termination in finite time is also
derived. According to numerical experiments, the algorithm for the JSR finds
the exact value for the vast majority of matrix families in dimensions less
than 20. For nonnegative matrices it works faster and finds JSR in dimensions
of order 100 within a few iterations; the same is observed for the algorithm
computing the LSR. To illustrate the efficiency of the new method we are able
to apply it in order to give answers to several conjectures which have been
recently stated in combinatorics, number theory, and the theory of formal
languages.
