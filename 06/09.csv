a given set of routes under the assumption of a heavy-traffic pattern. We
assume some TDMA protocol provides a background of synchronized time slots and
seek to schedule the routes' links to maximize the number of packets that get
delivered to their destinations per time slot. Our approach is to construct an
undirected graph G and to heuristically obtain node multicolorings for G that
can be turned into efficient link schedules. In G each node represents a link
to be scheduled and the edges are set up to represent every possible
interference for any given set of interference assumptions. We present two
multicoloring-based heuristics and study their performance through extensive
simulations. One of the two heuristics is based on relaxing the notion of a
node multicoloring by dynamically exploiting the availability of communication
opportunities that would otherwise be wasted. We have found that, as a
consequence, its performance is significantly superior to the other's.

finely-stranded corona where each strand is heated by a rapid pulse. However,
such fine structure has neither been resolved through direct imaging

appearance of cool and warm coronal loops (~1 MK, ~2-3 MK, respectively) --
warm loops appearing ""fuzzier"" than cool loops -- can be explained by models of
loops composed of subarcsecond strands, which are impulsively heated up to ~10
MK. That work predicts that images of hot coronal loops (>~6 MK) should again
show fine structure. Here we show that the predicted effect is indeed widely
observed in an active region with the Solar Dynamics Observatory, thus
supporting a scenario where impulsive heating of fine loop strands plays an
important role in powering the active corona.

direct imaging has remained elusive due to their low contrast at optical
wavelengths. Here we report the first images of a CME-driven shock as it
propagates through interplanetary space from 8R_Sun to 120R_Sun (0.5AU), using
observations from the STEREO Heliospheric Imager (HI). The CME was measured to
have a velocity of ~1000 km/s and a Mach number of 4.1\pm1.2, while the shock
front stand-off distance (Delta) was found to increase linearly to ~20 R_Sun at
0.5 AU. The normalised standoff distance (Delta/DO) showed reasonable agreement
with semi-empirical relations, where D_O is the CME radius. However, when
normalised using the radius of curvature, Delta/R_O did not agree well with
theory, implying that R_O was under-estimated by a factor of ~3-8. This is most
likely due to the difficulty in estimating the larger radius of curvature along
the CME axis from the observations, which provide only a cross-sectional view

need to adapt to these harvested energy arrivals. In this paper, we consider
optimization of point-to-point data transmission with an energy harvesting
transmitter which has a limited battery capacity, communicating in a wireless
fading channel. We consider two objectives: maximizing the throughput by a
deadline, and minimizing the transmission completion time of the communication
session. We optimize these objectives by controlling the time sequence of
transmit powers subject to energy storage capacity and causality constraints.
We, first, study optimal offline policies. We introduce a directional
water-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of
the necessary optimality conditions. We show the optimality of an adaptive
directional water-filling algorithm for the throughput maximization problem. We
solve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its
equivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart. Next, we consider
online policies. We use stochastic dynamic programming to solve for the optimal
online policy that maximizes the average number of bits delivered by a deadline
under stochastic fading and energy arrival processes with causal channel state
feedback. We also propose near-optimal policies with reduced complexity, and
numerically study their performances along with the performances of the offline

provides the solution of the initial value problem for the nonhomogeneous

Despite the discovery of this fundamental theory, the description of the

the difficulties of addressing QCD in the strong-coupling regime, where
nonperturbative effects are essential. By making numerical calculations in
discretized spacetime, lattice gauge theory enables the ab initio study of many

results, we show that random temporal variability in dispersal can accelerate
population spread. Demographic variability can further accelerate spread if it
is positively correlated with dispersal variability, for example if
high-fecundity years are also years in which juveniles tend to settle further
away from their parents. A simple model for the growth and spread of patches of
an invasive plant (perennial pepperweed, Lepidium latifolium) illustrates these
effects and shows that they can have substantial impacts on the predicted speed
of an invasion wave. Temporal variability in dispersal has gotten very little
attention in both the theoretical and empirical literatures on invasive species
spread. Our results suggest that this needs to change.

to understand the fate of protoplanets formed by disk instability. As part of a
larger study, we are using a 3D radiative hydrodynamics code to investigate how
an embedded gas giant planet interacts with a gas disk that undergoes
gravitational instabilities (GIs). This Letter presents results from
simulations with a Jupiter-mass planet placed in orbit at 25 AU within a 0.14
$M_{\odot}$ disk. The disk spans 5 to 40 AU around a 1 $M_{\odot}$ star and is
initially marginally unstable. In one simulation, the planet is inserted prior
to the eruption of GIs; in another, it is inserted only after the disk has
settled into a quasi-steady GI-active state, where heating by GIs roughly
balances radiative cooling. When the planet is present from the beginning, its
own wake stimulates growth of a particular global mode with which it strongly
interacts, and the planet plunges inward six AU in about 10$^3$ years. In both
cases with embedded planets, there are times when the planet's radial motion is
slow and varies in direction. At other times, when the planet appears to be
interacting with strong spiral modes, migration both inward and outward can be
relatively rapid, covering several AUs over hundreds of years. Migration in
both cases appears to stall near the inner Lindblad resonance of a dominant
low-order mode. Planet orbit eccentricities fluctuate rapidly between about
0.02 to 0.1 throughout the GI-active phases of the simulations.

life scientists for the past few decades. We now know that living cells take
advantage of stochasticity in some cases and counteract stochastic effects in
others. The source of intrinsic stochasticity in biomolecular systems are
random timings of individual reactions, which cumulatively drive the
variability in outputs of such systems. Despite the acknowledged relevance of
stochasticity in the functioning of living cells no rigorous method have been
proposed to precisely identify sources of variability. In this paper we propose
a novel methodology that allows us to calculate contributions of individual
reactions into the variability of a system's output. We demonstrate that some
reactions have dramatically different effects on noise than others.
Surprisingly, in the class of open conversion systems that serve as an
approximate model of signal transduction, the degradation of an output
contributes half of the total noise. We also demonstrate the importance of
degradation in other relevant systems and propose a degradation feedback
control mechanism that has the capability of an effective noise suppression.
Application of our method to some well studied biochemical systems such as:
gene expression, Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, and the p53 system indicates
that our methodology reveals an unprecedented insight into the origins of
variability in biochemical systems. For many systems an analytical
decomposition is not available; therefore the method has been implemented as a
Matlab package and is available from the authors upon request.

mathematics with applications in diverse fields. However, the research is
focused on systems with only one type of links, connectivity links. We review a
recently developed mathematical framework for analyzing percolation properties
of realistic scenarios of networks having links of two types, connectivity and
dependency links. This formalism was applied to study
Erd$\ddot{o}$s-R$\acute{e}$nyi (ER) networks that include also dependency
links. For an ER network with average degree $k$ that is composed of dependency
clusters of size $s$, the fraction of nodes that belong to the giant component,
$P_\infty$, is given by $ P_\infty=p^{s-1}[1-\exp{(-kpP_\infty)}]^s $ where
$1-p$ is the initial fraction of randomly removed nodes. Here, we apply the
formalism to the study of random-regular (RR) networks and find a formula for
the size of the giant component in the percolation process:
$P_\infty=p^{s-1}(1-r^k)^s$ where $r$ is the solution of
$r=p^s(r^{k-1}-1)(1-r^k)+1$. These general results coincide, for $s=1$, with
the known equations for percolation in ER and RR networks respectively without
dependency links. In contrast to $s=1$, where the percolation transition is
second order, for $s>1$ it is of first order. Comparing the percolation
behavior of ER and RR networks we find a remarkable difference regarding their
resilience. We show, analytically and numerically, that in ER networks with low
connectivity degree or large dependency clusters, removal of even a finite
number (zero fraction) of the network nodes will trigger a cascade of failures
that fragments the whole network. This result is in contrast to RR networks
where such cascades and full fragmentation can be triggered only by removal of
a finite fraction of nodes in the network.

distribution of matter. At present, the largest source of systematic
uncertainty in this analysis is the challenge of modeling the complex
relationship between galaxy redshift and the distribution of dark matter. If
all galaxies sat in the centers of halos, there would be minimal Finger-of-God
(FoG) effects and a simple relationship between the galaxy and matter
distributions. However, many galaxies, even some of the luminous red galaxies
(LRGs), do not lie in the centers of halos. Because the galaxy-galaxy lensing
is also sensitive to the off-centered galaxies, we show that we can use the
lensing measurements to determine the amplitude of this effect and to determine
the expected amplitude of FoG effects. We develop an approach for using the
lensing data to model how the FoG suppresses the power spectrum amplitudes and
show that the current data implies a 30% suppression at wavenumber k=0.2h/Mpc.
Our analysis implies that it is important to complement a spectroscopic survey
with an imaging survey with sufficient depth and wide field coverage. Joint
imaging and spectroscopic surveys allow a robust, unbiased use of the power
spectrum amplitude information: it improves the marginalized error of growth
rate fg=dln D/dln a by up to a factor of 2 over a wide range of redshifts
z<1.4. We also find that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w0, and
the neutrino mass, fnu, can be unbiasedly constrained by combining the lensing

u-g color profiles for these galaxies and show that most z~2 galaxies in our

these color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dust
content, they point to the existence of older stellar populations in the
centers of z~2 galaxies. This result is consistent with an ""inside-out""
scenario of galaxy growth. We find that the median color gradient is fairly
constant with redshift: [Delta(u-g_{rest})/Delta(log r)]_{median} = -0.46,
-0.44 and -0.49 for z~2, z~1 and z=0, respectively. Using structural parameters
derived from surface brightness profiles we confirm that at z~2 galaxy
morphology correlates well with specific star formation rate. At the same mass,
star forming galaxies have larger effective radii, bluer rest-frame u-g colors

similar to those at lower redshift, suggesting that the relations that give

consistent. Haloes with the bias we measure for the Mg II absorbers have a
corresponding mass of 1.8(+4.2/-1.6) \times 10^12h-1M_sun, although the actual
mean absorber halo mass will depend on the precise distribution of absorbers
within DM haloes. This mass estimate is consistent with observations at z=0.6,
suggesting that the halo masses of typical Mg II absorbers do not significantly
evolve from z~1. We additionally measure the average W{\lambda}2796>0.6 \AA gas
covering fraction to be f =0.5 within 60 h-1kpc around the DEEP2 galaxies, and
we find an absence of coincident strong Mg II absorption beyond a projected

it is a potentially powerful tracer of star formation activity. In this paper
we present a calibration of the star formation rate as a function of the [CII]
luminosity for a sample of 24 star-forming galaxies in the nearby universe.
This sample includes objects classified as HII regions or LINERs, but omits all
Seyfert galaxies with a significant AGN contribution to the mid-infrared
photometry. In order to calibrate the SFR against the line luminosity, we rely
on both GALEX FUV data, which is an ideal tracer of the unobscured star
formation, and MIPS 24 \mu m, to probe the dust-enshrouded fraction of star
formation. In case of normal star-forming galaxies, the [CII] luminosity
correlates well with the star formation rate. However, the extension of this
relation to more quiescent (Halpha EW <= 10 A) or ultraluminous galaxies should
be handled with caution, since these objects show a non-linearity in the
L([CII])-to-L(FIR) ratio as a function of L(FIR) (and thus, their star
formation activity).
  We provide two possible explanations for the origin of the tight correlation
between the [CII] emission and the star formation activity on a global
galaxy-scale. A first interpretation could be that the [CII] emission from PDRs
arises from the immediate surroundings of star-forming regions. Since PDRs are
neutral regions of warm dense gas at the boundaries between HII regions and
molecular clouds and they provide the bulk of [CII] emission in most galaxies,
we believe that a more or less constant contribution from these outer layers of
photon-dominated molecular clumps to the [CII] emission provides a
straightforward explanation for this close link between the [CII] luminosity
and SFR. Alternatively,... (abridged)

new pair-matching technique to isolate the dust attenuation curves from the
stellar continuum emission. The main results are: (i) the slope of the
attenuation curve in the optical varies weakly with sSFR, strongly with b/a,
and is significantly steeper than the Milky Way extinction law in
bulge-dominated galaxies; (ii) the NIR slope is constant, and matches the slope
of the Milky Way extinction law; (iii) the UV has a slope change consistent
with a dust bump at 2175AA which is evident in all samples and varies strongly
in strength with b/a in the bulge-dominated sample; (iv) there is a strong
increase in emission line-to-continuum dust attenuation with both decreasing
sSFR and increasing b/a; (v) radial gradients in dust attenuation increase
strongly with increasing sSFR, and the presence of a bulge does not alter the
strength of the gradients. These results are consistent with the picture in
which young stars are surrounded by dense `birth clouds' with low covering
factor which disperse on timescales of ~1e7 years and the diffuse interstellar
dust is distributed in a centrally concentrated disk with a smaller scaleheight
than the older stars that contribute the majority of the red and NIR light.

photometric, minimal-scatter estimators of V_rot applicable to large galaxy
samples from imaging surveys. To achieve this goal, we have constructed a
sample of 189 disk galaxies at redshifts z<0.1 with long-slit H-alpha
spectroscopy from Pizagno et al. (2007) and new observations. By construction,
this sample is a fair subsample of a large, well-defined parent disk sample of
~170 000 galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7
(SDSS DR7). The optimal photometric estimator of V_rot we find is stellar mass
M_* from Bell et al. (2003), based on the linear combination of a luminosity
and a colour. Assuming a Kroupa IMF, we find: log [V_{80}/(km s^-1)] = (2.142
+/- 0.004)+(0.278 +/- 0.010)[log (M_*/M_sun)-10.10], where V_{80} is the
rotation velocity measured at the radius R_{80} containing 80 per cent of the
i-band galaxy light. This relation has an intrinsic Gaussian scatter of 0.036
+/- 0.005 dex and a measured scatter of 0.056 dex in log V_{80}. For a fixed
IMF, we find that the dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios within R_{80},
(M_dyn/M_*)(R_{80}), decrease from approximately 10 to 3, as stellar mass
increases from M_* ~ 10^9 to 10^{11} M_sun. At a fixed stellar mass,
(M_dyn/M_*)(R_{80}) increases with disk size, so that it correlates more
tightly with stellar surface density than with stellar mass or disk size alone.
In future work, we will use these results to study disk galaxy formation and
evolution, and perform a fair, statistical analysis of the dynamics and masses
of a photometrically-selected sample of disk galaxies. [Abridged]

R_Sun) debris disks around more than a dozen of metal-rich white dwarfs (WD),
likely produced by tidal disruption of asteroids. Accretion of high-Z material
from these disks may account for the metal contamination of these WDs. It was
previously shown using local calculations that the Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag
acting on the dense, optically thick disk naturally drives metal accretion onto
the WD at the typical rate \dot M_{PR} \approx 10^8 g/s. Here we extend this
local analysis by exploring global evolution of the debris disk under the
action of the PR drag for a variety of assumptions about the disk properties.
We find that massive disks (mass > 10^{20} g), which are optically thick to
incident stellar radiation inevitably give rise to metal accretion at rates
\dot M > 0.2\dot M_{PR}. The magnitude of \dot M and its time evolution are
determined predominantly by the initial pattern of the radial distribution of
the debris (i.e. ring-like vs. disk-like) but not by the total mass of the
disk. The latter determines only the disk lifetime, which can be several Myr or
longer. Evolution of an optically thick disk generically results in the
development of a sharp outer edge of the disk. We also find that the low mass
(< 10^{20} g), optically thin disks exhibit \dot M << \dot M_{PR} and evolve on
characteristic timescale \sim 10^5-10^6 yr, independent of their total mass.

limiting unabsorbed luminosity of the detected discrete X-ray sources (0.2-10.0
keV) is approximately 3x10^36 ergs s^-1. A total of 22 discrete sources were
detected at the 3-sigma level or greater including one ultra-luminous X-ray
source (ULX). Based on multiwavelength comparisons, we identify X-ray sources
coincident with one SNR, the candidate microquasar N7793-S26, one HII region
and two foreground Galactic stars. We also find that the X-ray counterpart to
the candidate radio SNR R3 is time-variable in its X-ray emission: we therefore
rule out the possibility that this source is a single SNR. A marked asymmetry
is seen in the distribution of the discrete sources with the majority lying in
the eastern half of this galaxy. All of the sources were analyzed using
quantiles to estimate spectral properties and spectra of the four brightest
sources (including the ULX) were extracted and analyzed. We searched for
time-variability in the X-ray emission of the detected discrete sources using
our measured fluxes along with fluxes measured from prior Einstein and ROSAT
observations. From this study, three discrete X-ray sources are established to
be significantly variable. A spectral analysis of the galaxy's diffuse emission
is characterized by a temperature of kT = 0.19-0.25 keV. The luminosity
function of the discrete sources shows a slope with an absolute value of Gamma

determine the IR LF of the whole supercluster as well as the IR LFs of three
different regions in the supercluster: the cluster core, a large-scale
filament, and the cluster outskirts (excluding the filament). The IR LF shows
an environmental dependence which is not simply related to the local galaxy
density. The filament, an intermediate-density region in the A1763
supercluster, contains the highest fraction of IR-emitting galaxies at all
levels of IR luminosities. As expected, the core contains the lowest fraction
of IR-emitting galaxies and almost no Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs). The
relation between galaxy specific SFRs and stellar masses does not depend on the
environment, and it indicates that most supercluster LIRGs (in particular those
in the filament) are rather massive galaxies with relatively low specific SFRs.
A comparison with previous IR LF determinations from the literature confirms
that the mass-normalized total SFR in clusters increases with redshift, but
more rapidly than previously suggested for redshifts <0.4. We interpret our
findings within a possible scenario for the evolution of galaxies in and around

introduce the concept of absolute stability of a theory: if one can show that a
field at a single point---like infinity for instance---in spacetime is stable,
then stability of the field over the rest of spacetime is guaranteed for any
positive energy source configuration. The Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model
is stable in this manner, and previous studies of spherically symmetric
solutions suggest that certain classes of the single field Galileon (of which
the DGP model is a subclass) may have this property as well. We find, however,
that when general solutions are considered this is not the case. In fact, when
considering generic solutions there are no choices of free parameters in the
Galileon theory that will lead to absolute stability except the DGP choice. Our
analysis indicates that the DGP model is an exceptional choice among the large
class of possible single field Galileon theories. This implies that if general
solutions (non-spherically symmetric) exist they may be unstable. Given
astrophysical motivation for the Galileon, further investigation into these
unstable solutions may prove fruitful.

metal abundances are expected to set the nebular electron temperature with high
abundances producing low temperatures. Our HII region distribution covers a
large range of Galactocentric radius (5 to 22 kpc) and samples the Galactic
azimuth range 330 degree to 60 degree. Using our highest quality data (72
objects) we derived an O/H Galactocentric radial gradient of -0.0383 +/- 0.0074
dex/kpc. Combining these data with a similar survey made with the NRAO 140 Foot
telescope we get a radial gradient of -0.0446 +/- 0.0049 dex/kpc for this

discontinuities are detected. Dividing our sample into three Galactic azimuth
regions produced significantly different radial gradients that range from -0.03

at a given radius. We stress the importance of homogeneous samples to reduce
the confusion of comparing data sets with different systematics. Galactic

scattering to measure the neutron radius in $^{208}$Pb. This has important
implications for neutron stars and their crusts. We discuss X-ray observations

matter. Gravitational waves (GW) open a new window on neutron rich matter. They
come from sources such as neutron star mergers, rotating neutron star
mountains, and collective r-mode oscillations. Using large scale molecular
dynamics simulations, we find neutron star crust to be very strong. It can
support mountains on rotating neutron stars large enough to generate detectable
gravitational waves. Finally, neutrinos from core collapse supernovae (SN)
provide another, qualitatively different probe of neutron rich matter.
Neutrinos escape from the surface of last scattering known as the
neutrino-sphere. This is a low density warm gas of neutron rich matter.
Observations of neutrinos can probe nucleosyntheses in SN. Simulations of SN
depend on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron rich matter. We discuss a new
EOS based on virial and relativistic mean field calculations. We believe that
combing astronomical observations using photos, GW, and neutrinos, with
laboratory experiments on nuclei, heavy ion collisions, and radioactive beams
will fundamentally advance our knowledge of compact objects in the heavens, the
dense phases of QCD, the origin of the elements, and of neutron rich matter.

Secondly, we use a large ensemble of N-body simulations in the LCDM framework
to test this. Our theoretical results show that the covariance can be written
as the sum of two terms: a Poisson term, which dominates in the limit of rare
clusters; and a sample variance term, which dominates for more abundant
clusters. Our expressions are analogous to those of Hu & Kravtsov (2003) for
multiple cells and a single mass tracer. Calculating the covariance depends on:
the mass function and bias of clusters, and the variance of mass fluctuations
within the survey volume. The predictions show that there is a strong
bin-to-bin covariance between measurements. In terms of the cross-correlation
coefficient, we find r~0.5 for haloes with M<3e14 Msol at z=0. Comparison of
these predictions with estimates from simulations shows excellent agreement. We
use the Fisher matrix formalism to explore the cosmological information content
of the counts. We compare the Poisson likelihood model, with the more realistic
likelihood model of Lima & Hu (2004), and all terms entering the Fisher
matrices are evaluated using the simulations. We find that the Poisson
approximation should only be used for the rarest objects, M>3e14 Msol,
otherwise the information content of a survey of size V~13.5 [Gpc/h]^3 would be
overestimated, resulting in errors that are ~2 times smaller. As an auxiliary
result, we show that the bias of clusters, obtained from the cluster-mass
cross-variance, is linear on scales >50 Mpc/h, whereas that obtained from the
auto-variance is nonlinear.

An expression for the transition probability of this process is obtained after
the usual spin and polarisation sums, trace calculation and phase space

single sum over contributions from external field photons and an integration
over one of the phase space components. The validity of the general expression

nanometer length scales and femtosecond time scales has been a long-standing
challenge in optics. It would provide spectroscopic access to the elementary
optical excitations in matter on their natural length and time scales and
enable applications from ultrafast nano-opto-electronics to single molecule
quantum coherent control. Previous approaches have largely focused on using
surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonant nanostructures or SPP waveguides to
generate nanometer localized excitations. However, these implementations
generally suffer from mode mismatch between the far-field propagating light and
the near-field confinement. In addition, the spatial localization in itself may
depend on the spectral phase and amplitude of the driving laser pulse thus
limiting the degrees of freedom available to independently control the
nano-optical waveform. Here we utilize femtosecond broadband SPP coupling, by
laterally chirped fan gratings, onto the shaft of a monolithic noble metal tip,
leading to adiabatic SPP compression and localization at the tip apex. In
combination with spectral pulse shaping with feedback on the intrinsic
nonlinear response of the tip apex, we demonstrate the continuous micro- to
nano-scale self-similar mode matched transformation of the propagating
femtosecond SPP field into a 20 nm spatially and 16 fs temporally confined
light pulse at the tip apex. Furthermore, with the essentially wavelength and
phase independent 3D focusing mechanism we show the generation of arbitrary

with high nano-scale power delivery in free space and full spectral and
temporal control opens the door for the extension of the powerful nonlinear and
ultrafast vibrational and electronic spectroscopies to the nanoscale.

at Kitt Peak. The BigBOSS instrument is a robotically-actuated, fiber-fed
spectrograph capable of taking 5000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength
range from 340 nm to 1060 nm, with a resolution R = 3000-4800.
  Using data from imaging surveys that are already underway, spectroscopic
targets are selected that trace the underlying dark matter distribution. In
particular, targets include luminous red galaxies (LRGs) up to z = 1.0,
extending the BOSS LRG survey in both redshift and survey area. To probe the
universe out to even higher redshift, BigBOSS will target bright [OII] emission
line galaxies (ELGs) up to z = 1.7. In total, 20 million galaxy redshifts are
obtained to measure the BAO feature, trace the matter power spectrum at smaller
scales, and detect redshift space distortions. BigBOSS will provide additional
constraints on early dark energy and on the curvature of the universe by
measuring the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 600,000 2.2 < z < 3.5
quasars.
  BigBOSS galaxy BAO measurements combined with an analysis of the broadband
power, including the Ly-alpha forest in BigBOSS quasar spectra, achieves a FOM
of 395 with Planck plus Stage III priors. This FOM is based on conservative
assumptions for the analysis of broad band power (kmax = 0.15), and could grow
to over 600 if current work allows us to push the analysis to higher wave
numbers (kmax = 0.3). BigBOSS will also place constraints on theories of
modified gravity and inflation, and will measure the sum of neutrino masses to

induced by magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions break the homogenous spin-singlet spin

While replacing Cu$^{2+}$ with nonmagnetic Zn$^{2+}$ ions, the frustration and
antiferromagnetic correlation between Cu$^{2+}$ ions is weakened, leading to
breakage of a spin liquid state and suppression of the low-dimensional AFM.

two-neutron addition and removal transitions by means of the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field model and the continuum quasiparticle
random phase approximation formulated in the coordinate space representation.
It is found that the pair transfer strength for the transitions between the
ground states becomes significantly large for the isotopes with $A \ge 140$,
reflecting very small neutron separation energy and long tails of the weakly
bound $3p$ orbits. In $^{132-140}$Sn, a peculiar feature of the pair transfer
is seen in transitions to low-lying excited $0^+$ states. They can be regarded
as a novel kind of pair vibrational mode which is characterized by an
anomalously long tail of the transition density extending to far outside of the
nuclear surface, and a large strength comparable to that of the ground-state
transitions. The presence of the weakly bound neutron orbits plays a central
role for these anomalous behaviors.

required precision is achieved. This does not necessarily mean, however, that
the stellar rates are constrained equally well because only capture on the
ground state of a target is measured in the laboratory. Captures on excited
states can considerably contribute to stellar rates already at typical
s-process temperatures. We show that the ground state contribution X to a
stellar rate is the relevant measure to identify reactions which are or could
be well constrained by experiments and apply it to (n,gamma) reactions in the
s-process. It is further shown that the maximally possible reduction in
uncertainty of a rate through determination of the g.s. cross section is

seems to provide improved estimators of many parameters of the popu- lation in
the huge studied problems in the literature. It is developed for situations
where the variable of interest is difficult or expensive to measure, but where
ranking in small sub-samples is easy. In This paper, we introduced two
estimators for the entropy and compare them with each other and the estimator
of the entropy in Simple Random Sampling (SRS) in the sense of bias and Root of
Mean Square Errors (RMSE). It is observed that the RSS scheme would improve
this estimator. The best estimator of the entropy is used along with the
estimator of the mean and two biased and unbiased estimators of variance based
on RSS scheme, to esti- mate the KL information and perform goodness of fit

requirement of sufficiently suppressing flavor-changing neutral currents. There
are various standard approaches for dealing with this problem, but they all
tend to share a common feature; all of the Higgs doublets couple very weakly to
the first generation quarks. Here we consider a simple two Higgs doublet model
which is able to have large couplings to the first generation, while also being
safe from flavor constraints. We assume only that there is an SU(3)_f flavor
symmetry which is respected by the couplings of one of the Higgs doublets, and
which is broken by Hermitian Yukawa couplings of the second doublet. As a
result of the large permitted couplings to the first generation quarks, this
scenario may be used to address the excess in W+dijet events recently observed
by CDF at the Tevatron. Moreover, Hermitian Yukawa coupling matrices arise
naturally in a broad class of solutions to the strong CP problem, providing a
compelling context for the model.

two interpenetrating homogeneous fluids moving with relative velocity

the two fluids are interacting via a linear drag term. Both test problems are
simple to set up in any numerical code and can be run with periodic boundary

the dust-to-gas ratio and the amplitude of the drag coefficient. A stability
analysis of waves in a gas-dust system is also presented, showing that sound

the periphery of the super-giant shell LMC 4 (Shapley Constellation III). The
PMS stellar content of the regions is revealed through the differential Hess
diagrams and the observed color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Further statistical
analysis of stellar distributions along cross-sections of the faint part of the
CMDs allowed the quantitative assessment of the PMS stars census, and the
isolation of faint PMS stars as the true low-mass stellar members of the
regions. These distributions are found to be well represented by a double
Gaussian function, the first component of which represents the main-sequence
field stars and the second the native PMS stars of each region. Based on this
result, a cluster membership probability was assigned to each PMS star
according to its CMD position. The higher extinction in the region LH 88 did
not allow the unambiguous identification of its native stellar population. The
CMD distributions of the PMS stars with the highest membership probability in
the regions LH 60, LH 63 and LH 72 exhibit an extraordinary similarity among
the regions, suggesting that these stars share common characteristics, as well
as common recent star formation history. Considering that the regions are
located at different areas of the edge of LMC 4, this finding suggests that
star formation along the super-giant shell may have occurred almost
simultaneously.

the medium. In this context, triggered hard dihadron correlations constitute a
class of observables set between hard single inclusive hadrons (dominated by
the leading jet fragments) and fully reconstructed jets - while they probe some
features of the perturbative QCD evolution of a parton shower in the medium,
they do not suffer from the problem of finding a suitable separation between
soft perturbative (jet-like) and soft non-perturbative (medium-like) physics as
the identification of full jets does. On the other hand, the trigger
requirement introduces non-trivial complications to the process, which makes
the medium-modification of the correlation pattern difficult and non-intuitive
to understand. In this work, we review the basic physics underlying triggered

finite-disorder critical point of the Random-field Ising model (RFIM) has the
peculiarity to involve some 'droplet' exponent $\theta$ that enters the
generalized hyperscaling relation $2-\alpha= \nu (d-\theta)$. In the present
paper, to better understand the meaning of this droplet exponent $\theta$
beyond its role in the thermodynamics, we discuss the statistics of low-energy
excitations generated by an imposed single spin-flip with respect to the ground
state, as well as the statistics of equilibrium avalanches i.e. the
magnetization jumps that occur in the sequence of ground-states as a function
of the external magnetic field. The droplet scaling theory predicts that the
distribution $dl/l^{1+\theta}$ of the linear-size $l$ of low-energy excitations
transforms into the distribution $ds/s^{1+{\theta/d_f}}$ for the size $s$
(number of spins) of excitations of fractal dimension $d_f$ ($s \sim l^{d_f}$).
In the non-mean-field region $d<d_c$, droplets are compact $d_f=d$, whereas in
the mean-field region $d>d_c$, droplets have a fractal dimension $d_f=2 \theta$
leading to the well-known mean-field result $ds/s^{3/2}$. Zero-field
equilibrium avalanches are expected to display the same distribution
$ds/s^{1+{\theta/d_f}}$. We also discuss the statistics of equilibrium
avalanches integrated over the external field and finite-size behaviors. These
expectations are checked numerically for the Dyson hierarchical version of the
RFIM, where the droplet exponent $\theta(\sigma)$ can be varied as a function
of the effective long-range interaction $J(r) \sim 1/r^{d+\sigma}$ in $d=1$.

validate the method by reconstructing a known SFH from Monte Carlo-generated

GRBs with known redshift and compare it against the SFH obtained by independent
methods. The main conclusion is that the level of star formation activity at $z

0.01 M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$). This is a factor 3-5 times higher than
deduced from high-$z$ galaxy searches through drop-out techniques. If true,
this might alleviate the long-standing problem of a photon-starving
reionization; it might also indicate that galaxies accounting for most of the

kinematics are dominated by the rotation, with a disk expansion velocity on the
order of 0.2km/s. The rotation law within the disk is compatible with Keplerian
rotation. As the star probably rotates at about 70% of its critical velocity

idea of how the real neurons that generated the data are connected and how they
influence each other. In this chapter we describe how to do this for the
simplest kind of model: an Ising network. We derive algorithms for finding the
best model connection strengths for fitting a given data set, as well as faster
approximate algorithms based on mean field theory. We test the performance of
these algorithms on data from model networks and experiments.

expected to host exotic topological quantum effects and find applications in
spintronics and quantum computation. The experimental realization of these
ideas requires fabrication of versatile devices based on bulk-insulating TIs

exemplified by Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 is the significant bulk conduction, which
remains unsolved despite extensive efforts involving nanostructuring, chemical
doping and electrical gating. Here we report a novel approach for engineering
the band structure of TIs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of
(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 ternary compounds. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and transport measurements show that the topological surface states
exist over the entire composition range of (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 (x = 0 to 1),
indicating the robustness of bulk Z2 topology. Most remarkably, the systematic
band engineering leads to ideal TIs with truly insulating bulk and tunable
surface state across the Dirac point that behave like one quarter of graphene.
This work demonstrates a new route to achieving intrinsic quantum transport of
the topological surface states and designing conceptually new TI devices with
well-established semiconductor technology.

corrections made to possible orbits of the progenitor, using a Bayesian
technique known as Parallel Tempering to efficiently explore the parameter

streams on the sky, if the host halo is considered to be axisymmetric. By
adding kinematic data or the circular velocity curve of the host to the fitting

guides secondary users to focus the search of unused radio spectrum to those

is based on machine learning, which makes it adaptive with the temporally and
spatially varying radio spectrum. Furthermore, there is no need for dynamic
modeling of the primary activity since it is implicitly learned over time.
Energy efficiency is achieved by minimizing the number of assigned sensors per
each subband under a constraint on miss detection probability. It is important
to control the missed detections because they cause collisions with primary
transmissions and lead to retransmissions at both the primary and secondary
user. Simulations show that the proposed machine learning based sensing policy
improves the overall throughput of the secondary network and improves the

oscillators. For finite coupling strengths, the stationary distribution of the
damped system is not of the Gibbs form, in contrast to standard thermodynamics.
With the help of the quantum Hamiltonian of mean force, we quantify this
deviation exactly for a harmonic oscillator and provide approximations in the
limit of high and low temperatures, and weak and strong couplings. Moreover, in
the semiclassical regime, we use the quantum Smoluchowski equation to obtain
results valid for any potential. We, finally, give a physical interpretation of
the deviation in terms of the initial system-reservoir coupling.

especially in the soft X-ray region, is an important asset at XFELs. However,
the baseline of the European XFEL, including the soft X-ray SASE3 line,
foresees planar undulators only. The lowest-risk strategy for implementing
polarization control at SASE3 involves adding an APPLE II-type undulator at the
end of the planar undulator, to exploit the microbunching from the baseline
FEL. 5m-long APPLE II undulators are standard devices at synchrotrons. However,
the choice of a short helical radiator leads to the problem of background
suppression. The driving idea of our proposal is that the background radiation
can be suppressed by spatial filtering. Slits can be inserted behind the APPLE
II radiator, where the linearly-polarized radiation spot size is about 30 times
larger than the radiation spot size from the helical radiator. The last 7 cells
of the SASE3 undulator are left with an open gap in order to provide a total 42
m drift section for electron beam and radiation. The linearly-polarized
radiation spot size increases along the drift, and the linearly polarized
background radiation can be suppressed by the slits. At the same time, the
microbunch structure is preserved. 100GW level coherent radiation is emitted in
the helical radiator. The filtering setup consists of a pair of water cooled
slits for X-ray beam filtering and of a 5m-long magnetic chicane, creating an
offset for slit installation immediately behind the helical radiator. Electrons
and X-rays are separated before the slits by the chicane, and the electron beam
can pass by the filtering setup without perturbations. Based on start-to-end
simulations we present calculations from the SASE3 undulator entrance up to the
radiator exit including the modulated electron beam transport by the FODO
focusing system in the low charge (20pC) mode of operation.

Rossby-wave dynamics and nonlinear decadal variability. When coupled, the
atmosphere forces the ocean by wind-stress while, simultaneously, the ocean
affects the atmosphere by thermal forcing in terms of a vorticity source.
Coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations show two stable flow patterns associated
with the topographically induced atmospheric bimodality and a sustained
oscillation due to interaction between atmospheric bimodality and oceanic
Rossby dynamics. The oscillation is of inter-annual to inter-decadal
periodicity and occurs in a reasonably wide parameter domain.

diagrams (CMDs) of the evolution of the X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 in
outburst can be used to separate the disc from the jet. Monitoring in two
wavebands is all that is required. This outburst in 2000 was well studied, and
both disc and jet were known to contribute. During the outburst the data follow
a well defined path in the CMD, describing what would be expected from a heated
single-temperature blackbody of approximately constant area, except when the
data appear redder than this track. This is due to the non-thermal jet
component which dominates the OIR moreso during hard X-ray states at high
luminosities, and which is quenched in the soft state. The CMD therefore shows
state-dependent hysteresis, in analogy with (but not identical to) the well
established X-ray hardness-intensity diagram of black hole transients. The
blackbody originates in the X-ray illuminated, likely unwarped, outer accretion
disc. We show that the CMD can be approximately reproduced by a model that
assumes various correlations between X-ray, OIR disc and OIR jet fluxes. We
find evidence for the OIR jet emission to be decoupled from the disc near the
peak of the hard state.

drive intense starbursts, but the link between interstellar gas physics, large

fuel nuclear starbursts, triggered gas turbulence and fragmentation can drive
more extended starbursts in massive star clusters with high fractions of dense

previously learned solutions rather than a single complete solution. The system
exploits strong features in the multi-dimensional function produced by
reinforcement learning in solving a particular task. These features are stable
and easy to recognize early in the learning process. They generate a
partitioning of the state space and thus the function. The partition is
represented as a graph. This is used to index and compose functions stored in a
case base to form a close approximation to the solution of the new task.
Experiments demonstrate that function composition often produces more than an
order of magnitude increase in learning rate compared to a basic reinforcement
learning algorithm.

graphs describing the logical relationship between observations and their
explanations, and learns parameters by computing inside and outside probability
generalized for logic programs. The complexity analysis shows that when
combined with OLDT search for all explanations for observations, the graphical

is the limit where this number is unity. This is evident in the behavior of the

methodology and examine eight implicit assumptions about the problems, planners
and metrics used in many of these comparisons. The problem assumptions are:
PR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be
penalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains, PR2) minor
syntactic differences in representation do not affect performance, and PR3)
problems should be solvable by STRIPS capable planners unless they require ADL.
The planner assumptions are: PL1) the latest version of a planner is the best
one to use, PL2) default parameter settings approximate good performance, and
PL3) time cut-offs do not unduly bias outcome. The metrics assumptions are: M1)
performance degrades similarly for each planner when run on degraded runtime
environments (e.g., machine platform) and M2) the number of plan steps
distinguishes performance. We find that most of these assumptions are not
supported empirically; in particular, that planners are affected differently by

thirty years, remains elusive and undetected. It also suffers, in its original
context of gravitational black holes, from conceptual difficulties. Of
particular note is the trans-Planckian problem, which is concerned with the
apparent origin of the radiation in absurdly high frequencies. In order to gain
better theoretical understanding and, it is hoped, experimental verification of
Hawking radiation, much study is being devoted to systems which model the
spacetime geometry of black holes, and which, by analogy, are also thought to
emit Hawking radiation. These analogue systems typically exhibit dispersion,
which regularizes the wave behaviour at the horizon but does not lend itself
well to analytic treatment, thus rendering Hawking's prediction less secure. A
general analytic method for dealing with Hawking radiation in dispersive
systems has proved difficult to find.
  This thesis presents new numerical and analytic results for Hawking emission
spectra in dispersive systems. It examines two black-hole analogue systems: it
begins by introducing the well-known acoustic model, presenting some original
results in that context; then, through analogy with the acoustic model, goes on
to develop the lesser-known fibre-optical model.

in monitoring deployed teams, we often cannot rely on the agents to always
communicate their state to the monitoring system. This paper presents a
non-intrusive approach to monitoring by 'overhearing', where the monitored
team's state is inferred (via plan-recognition) from team-members' routine
communications, exchanged as part of their coordinated task execution, and
observed (overheard) by the monitoring system. Key challenges in this approach
include the demanding run-time requirements of monitoring, the scarceness of
observations (increasing monitoring uncertainty), and the need to scale-up
monitoring to address potentially large teams. To address these, we present a
set of complementary novel techniques, exploiting knowledge of the social
structures and procedures in the monitored team: (i) an efficient probabilistic
plan-recognition algorithm, well-suited for processing communications as
observations; (ii) an approach to exploiting knowledge of the team's social
behavior to predict future observations during execution (reducing monitoring
uncertainty); and (iii) monitoring algorithms that trade expressivity for
scalability, representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses, but
allowing for any number of agents and their different activities to be
represented in a single coherent entity. We present an empirical evaluation of
these techniques, in combination and apart, in monitoring a deployed team of
agents, running on machines physically distributed across the country, and
engaged in complex, dynamic task execution. We also compare the performance of
these techniques to human expert and novice monitors, and show that the
techniques presented are capable of monitoring at human-expert levels, despite

predict problematic human-computer dialogues using a corpus of 4692 dialogues
collected with the 'How May I Help You' (SM) spoken dialogue system. The
Problematic Dialogue Predictor can be immediately applied to the system's
decision of whether to transfer the call to a human customer care agent, or be
used as a cue to the system's dialogue manager to modify its behavior to repair
problems, and even perhaps, to prevent them. We show that a Problematic
Dialogue Predictor using automatically-obtainable features from the first two
exchanges in the dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 13.2% more
accurately than the baseline.

empirical and theoretical results clearly showing the discrimination power of
ensemble classifiers. It has been previously argued that the search of this
classification power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need
to obtain interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one
might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep classification
strength is being raised in a growing number of machine learning or data mining
papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theoretically and
empirically the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into
the hardness of the simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. Then
we provide an efficient ""top-down and prune"" induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly
derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is
to our knowledge the first attempt to build a voting classifier as a base
formula using the weak learning framework (the one which was previously highly
successful for decision tree induction), and not the strong learning framework
(as usual for such classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a
well-known induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept
representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC also relies
on recent or new results we give about particular cases of boosting known as
partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on
thirty-one domains, most of which readily available, tend to display the
ability of WIDC to produce small, accurate, and interpretable decision
committees.

utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system so that they work
synergistically to maximize a global utility. The particular problem domain we
explore is the control of network routing by placing agents on all the routers
in the network. Conventional approaches to this task have the agents all use
the Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA). We demonstrate that in many
cases, due to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's
performance, having agents use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate
cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route infinitesimally small
amounts of traffic. The utility functions of the individual agents are not
""aligned"" with the global utility, intuitively speaking. As a particular
example of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new
links to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in
overall throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the
agents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost incurred by
all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost
averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to 'side-effects', in this
case of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics of
Collective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the issue of
avoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time
and space. We present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive
an algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that of
having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present
experiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based
version of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated
via empirical means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also
outperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the
ISPA. In particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess' paradox.

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Factored MDPs represent a complex state space
using state variables and the transition model using a dynamic Bayesian
network. This representation often allows an exponential reduction in the
representation size of structured MDPs, but the complexity of exact solution
algorithms for such MDPs can grow exponentially in the representation size. In
this paper, we present two approximate solution algorithms that exploit
structure in factored MDPs. Both use an approximate value function represented
as a linear combination of basis functions, where each basis function involves
only a small subset of the domain variables. A key contribution of this paper
is that it shows how the basic operations of both algorithms can be performed
efficiently in closed form, by exploiting both additive and context-specific
structure in a factored MDP. A central element of our algorithms is a novel
linear program decomposition technique, analogous to variable elimination in
Bayesian networks, which reduces an exponentially large LP to a provably
equivalent, polynomial-sized one. One algorithm uses approximate linear
programming, and the second approximate dynamic programming. Our dynamic
programming algorithm is novel in that it uses an approximation based on
max-norm, a technique that more directly minimizes the terms that appear in
error bounds for approximate MDP algorithms. We provide experimental results on
problems with over 10^40 states, demonstrating a promising indication of the
scalability of our approach, and compare our algorithm to an existing
state-of-the-art approach, showing, in some problems, exponential gains in

scattering allows us to define frequency-dependent effective acoustic

formulation can lead to both positive and negative acoustic parameters, where
the acoustic parameters are the scalar bulk modulus and the tensorial mass
density and, therefore, anisotropic wave propagation is allowed with both
positive or negative refraction index. It is also shown that the surface fields
on the scatterer are the main responsible of the anomalous behavior of the
effective medium, therefore complex scatterers can be used to engineer the
frequency response of the effective medium, and some examples of application to
different scatterers are given. Finally, the theory is extended to
electromagnetic wave propagation, where Mie resonances are found to be the

is investigated experimentally. Rotating spirals with three arms, which
correspond to the kinks between regions with different colliding phases, are
the dominating pattern. This preferred number of arms corresponds to period
tripling of the agitated granular layer, unlike predominantly subharmonic
Faraday crispations in dry granular matter. The chirality of the spatiotemporal
pattern corresponds to the rotation direction of the spirals.

based passive components in the RF microelectronics domain, especially in
transceiver components. This is due to some excellent properties of the MEMS
devices like low loss, excellent isolation etc. in the microwave frequency
domain where the on-chip passives normally tend to become leakier and degrades
the transceiver performance. This paper presents a comparative analysis between
MEMS-resonator based and MEMS-passives based band-pass filter configurations
for RF applications, along with their design, simulation, fabrication and
characterization. The filters were designed to have a center frequency of 455
kHz, meant for use as the intermediate frequency (IF) filter in superheterodyne
receivers. The filter structures have been fabricated in PolyMUMPs process, a
three-polysilicon layer surface micromachining process.

quantum system, without external observer, using a no-collapse interpretation
of quantum mechanics. Assuming infinite divisibility suffices to explain
through a single model the theories of all fundamental interactions: general
relativity for gravitation, and the standard model of elementary particle
physics for electromagnetism, the weak and strong nuclear interactions.
