fluid plays the same role as the short-time self-diffusion coefficient D_S in a
colloidal liquid, in the sense that the dynamic properties of the former, at
times much longer than the mean free time, and properly scaled with D_S, will
indistinguishable from those of a colloidal liquid with the same interaction
potential. One important consequence of such dynamic equivalence is that the
ratio D_L/ D_S of the long-time to the short-time self-diffusion coefficients
must then be the same for both, an atomic and a colloidal system characterized
by the same inter-particle interactions. This naturally extends to atomic
fluids a well-known dynamic criterion for freezing of colloidal liquids[Phys.

molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations on (soft- and hard-sphere) model

superconductors has become the most efficient practical way to achieve high
critical currents. In this situation pinning occurs via trapping of the
vortex-line segments and the critical current is determined by the typical
length of the trapped segments. To verify analytical estimates and develop a
quantitative description of strong pinning, we numerically simulated isolated
vortex lines driven through an array of nanoparticles. We found that the
critical force grows roughly as the square root of the pin density and it is
strongly suppressed by thermal noise. The configurations of pinned lines are
strongly anisotropic, displacements in the drive directions are much larger
than in the transverse direction. Moreover, we found that the roughening index
for the longitudinal displacements exceeds one. This indicates that the local
stresses in the critical region increase with the total line length and the
elastic description breaks down in the thermodynamic limit. Thermal noise
reduces the anisotropy of displacements in the critical regions and straightens
the lines.

range of metallographic cooling rates. These have been attributed to their
formation in a metallic core, approximately 150 km in radius, that cooled to
crystallization in the absence of any appreciable insulating mantle. Here we
build upon this formation model by incorporating several new constraints. These
include (i) a recent U-Pb radiometric closure age of <2.5 Myr after solar
system formation for the group IVA iron Muonionalusta, (ii) new measurements
and modeling of highly siderophile element compositions for a suite of IVAs,
and (iii) consideration of the thermal effects of heating by the decay of the
short-lived radionuclide 60Fe. Our model for the thermal evolution of the IVA
core suggests that it was approximately 50 - 110 km in radius after being
collisionally exposed. This range is due to uncertainties in the initial
abundance of live 60Fe incorporated into the IVA core. Our models define a
relationship between cooling rate and closure age, which is used to make
several predictions that can be tested with future measurements. In general,
our results show that diverse cooling rates and early U-Pb closure ages can
only coexist on mantle-free bodies and that energy released by the decay of
60Fe reduces the core size necessary to produce diverse metallographic cooling
rates. The influence of 60Fe on cooling rates has largely been neglected in
previous core formation models; accounting for this heat source can affect size
estimates for other iron meteorite cores that cooled to crystallization in the
presence of live 60Fe. Candidates for such a scenario of early, mantle-free
formation include the iron IIAB, IIIAB and IVB groups.

usually developed assuming that experts derive utility only from the quality of
their predictions (e.g., score awarded by the rule, or payoff in a prediction
market). We study a more realistic setting in which (a) the principal is a
decision maker and will take a decision based on the expert's prediction; and
(b) the expert has an inherent interest in the decision. For example, in a
corporate decision market, the expert may derive different levels of utility
from the actions taken by her manager. As a consequence the expert will usually
have an incentive to misreport her forecast to influence the choice of the
decision maker if typical scoring rules are used. We develop a general model
for this setting and introduce the concept of a compensation rule. When
combined with the expert's inherent utility for decisions, a compensation rule
induces a net scoring rule that behaves like a normal scoring rule. Assuming
full knowledge of expert utility, we provide a complete characterization of all
(strictly) proper compensation rules. We then analyze the situation where the
expert's utility function is not fully known to the decision maker. We show
bounds on: (a) expert incentive to misreport; (b) the degree to which an expert
will misreport; and (c) decision maker loss in utility due to such uncertainty.
These bounds depend in natural ways on the degree of uncertainty, the local
degree of convexity of net scoring function, and natural properties of the
decision maker's utility function. They also suggest optimization procedures
for the design of compensation rules. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of
compensation rules as market scoring rules for self-interested experts in a
prediction market.

under arbitrary four-dimensional coordinate transformations. We identify these
additional degrees of freedom with the electromagnetic potentials, which
thereby acquire a space-time interpretation. The resulting theory is similar to
the traditional Einstein-Maxwell theory, differing primarily in the emergence
of a coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields. We show
that the proposed reformulation of general relativity provides a rich framework
for addressing a number of outstanding problems in contemporary gravitational
physics.

density structures, likely to be representative of the initial conditions for
massive star and star cluster formation. CO emission from IRDCs has the
potential to be useful for tracing their dynamics, but may be affected by
depleted gas phase abundances due to freeze-out onto dust grains. Here we
analyze C18O J=1-0 and J=2-1 emission line data, taken with the IRAM 30m
telescope, of the highly filamentary IRDC G035.39.-0033. We derive the
excitation temperature as a function of position and velocity, with typical
values of ~7K, and thus derive total mass surface densities, Sigma_C18O,
assuming standard gas phase abundances and accounting for optical depth in the
line, which can reach values of ~1. The mass surface densities reach values of
~0.07 g/cm^2. We compare these results to the mass surface densities derived
from mid-infrared (MIR) extinction mapping, Sigma_SMF, by Butler & Tan, which
are expected to be insensitive to the dust temperatures in the cloud. With a
significance of >10sigma, we find Sigma_C18O/Sigma_SMF decreases by about a
factor of 5 as Sigma increases from ~0.02 to ~0.2 g/cm^2, which we interpret as
evidence for CO depletion. Several hundred solar masses are being affected,
making this one of the most massive clouds in which CO depletion has been
observed directly. We present a map of the depletion factor in the filament and
discuss implications for the formation of the IRDC.

tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole. The distance to the source,
its transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate
several means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly-refined
relationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity,
and de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is
obtained: log(M/Msun) = 5.5 +/- 1.1 (1 sigma confidence). The confidence
interval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,
which includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass
range is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some
variability arguments, and it safely excludes high mass values where it becomes
impossible for black holes to disrupt stars. Future refinements in
relationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity
will be able to reduce the uncertainty in related mass estimates by a factor of
two, making this technique comparable to estimates based on the M-sigma
relationship. Possible difficulties in placing such events on the fundamental
plane, a potential future test of their suitability, and uncertainties in mass
stemming from variable X-ray emission are discussed. As near and longer-term
survey efforts such as Pan-STARRS, LSST, LOFAR, the Square Kilometer Array, and
eROSITA begin to detect many tidal disruption events, black hole mass estimates
from combined X-ray and radio observations may prove to be very pragmatic.

mechanical evolution of quarkonia states within a time-dependent harmonic

speculate whether the suppression pattern of the rather precise NA60 data from

Theoretical support for this hypothesis comes from the cluster expansion of the

  of macroparticles and its temperature dependence",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A theoretical model for the effect of water hydrogen bonding on the
thermodynamics of hydrophobic hydration is proposed as a combination of the
classical density functional theory with the recently developed probabilistic
approach to water hydrogen bonding in the vicinity of a hydrophobic surface.
The former allows one to determine the distribution of water molecules in the
vicinity of a macroscopic hydrophobic particle and calculate the thermodynamic
quantities of hydrophobic hydration as well as their temperature dependence,
whereas the latter allows one to implement the effect of the hydrogen bonding
ability of water molecules on their interaction with the hydrophobic surface
into the DFT formalism. This effect arises because the number and energy of
hydrogen bonds that a water molecule forms near a hydrophobic surface differ
from their bulk values. Such an alteration gives rise to a hydrogen bond
contribution to the external potential field whereto a water molecule is
subjected in that vicinity. This contribution is shown to play a dominant role
in the interaction of a water molecule with the surface. Our approach predicts
that the free energy of hydration of a planar hydrophobic surface in a model
liquid water decreases with increasing temperature in the range from 293 K to
333 K. This result is indirectly supported by the counter-intuitive
experimental observation that under some conditions the hydration of a
molecular hydrophobe is entropically favorable as well as by the molecular
dynamics simulations predicting positive hydration entropy for sufficiently
large (nanoscale) hydrophobes.

in an optimal control problem. In Poyiadjis et al. [2011] an original particle
algorithm to compute the filter derivative was proposed and it was shown using
numerical examples that the particle estimate was numerically stable in the
sense that it did not deteriorate over time. In this paper we substantiate this
claim with a detailed theoretical study. Lp bounds and a central limit theorem
for this particle approximation of the filter derivative are presented. It is
further shown that under mixing conditions these Lp bounds and the asymptotic

between the MOND and Newtonian regimes, and no dynamics needs to be defined for
the vector field because preferred-frame effects are negligible at small
distances. The field equations depend on second (and lower) derivatives, and
avoid thus the generic instabilities related to higher derivatives. Their
perturbative solution around a Schwarzschild background is remarkably simple to
derive. We also underline why the proposed model is particularly efficient

structure and evolution of spiral galaxies, but typically we are denied clear
views of MW stellar populations at low Galactic latitudes because of extinction
by interstellar dust. However, the combination of 2MASS near-infrared (NIR) and
Spitzer-IRAC mid-infrared (MIR) photometry enables a powerful method for
determining the line of sight reddening to any star: the sampled wavelengths
lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of most
stars, where, to first order, all stars have essentially the same intrinsic
color. Thus, changes in stellar NIR-MIR colors due to interstellar reddening
are readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colors
and magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their
intrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for Galactic structure
studies. In this paper we explore this ""Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess"" (RJCE)
method and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the RJCE method
based on a single reference color, (H-[4.5um]), can rather accurately remove
dust effects from previously uninterpretable 2MASS color-magnitude diagrams of
stars in fields along the heavily reddened Galactic mid-plane, with results far
superior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods. We
also show that ""total"" Galactic midplane extinction looks rather different from
that predicted using 100um emission maps from the IRAS/ISSA and COBE/DIRBE
instruments as presented by Schlegel et al. Instead, the Galactic mid-plane
extinction strongly resembles the distribution of 13-CO (J=1->0) emission.
Future papers will focus on refining the RJCE method and applying the technique
to understand better not only dust and its distribution, but the distribution
of stars intermixed with the dust in the low-latitude Galaxy.

Peng et al (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. SDSS
groups. We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the
environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are
red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses,
whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite
quenching efficiency, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched
upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent
of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity. The red fraction
of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity, a measure of
location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e. dark
matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local
density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the halo mass gives
clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show
that the action of mass-quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of
the DM mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al (2010) approach to
predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into
passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed
mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this
phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M* is the
same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M* for the
star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 10^12M\odot, which
emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in
Peng et al (2010). Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the
central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about
25%.

throughout transits of their giant planets. Our goal was to detect the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during
eclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of
planet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected
with ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting
upper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two
systems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.
Because WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the
most probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is
viewed nearly pole-on. This implies the WASP-1 star has a high obliquity with
respect to the edge-on planetary orbit. Because WASP-2 is a K1V star, and is
expected to be a slow rotator, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the
stellar obliquity. Our data and our analysis contradict an earlier claim that
WASP-2b has a retrograde orbit, thereby revoking this system's status as an
exception to the pattern that cool stars have low obliquities.

Adiabatic braiding of anyons is exploited as topologically protected logical
gate operations. Thus, the adiabaticity upon which the notion of quantum
statistics is defined, plays a fundamental role in defining the non-Abelian
anyons. We study the non-adiabatic effects in braidings of Ising-type anyons,
namely Majorana fermions in topological superconductors, using the formalism of
time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Using this formalism, we
consider non-adiabatic corrections to non-Abelian statistics from: (1)
tunneling splitting of anyons imposing an additional dynamical phase to the
transformation of ground states; (2) transitions to excited states that are
potentially destructive to non-Abelian statistics since the non-local fermion
occupation can be spoiled by such processes. However, if the bound states are
localized and being braided together with the anyons, non-Abelian statistics
can be recovered once the definition of Majorana operators is appropriately
generalized taking into account the fermion parity in these states. On the
other hand, if the excited states are extended over the whole system and form a
continuum, the notion of local fermion parity no longer holds. We then
quantitatively characterize the errors introduced in this situation.

to the emission region surrounding Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, on sub-horizon scales. Recently, a closure
phase of 0+-40 degrees was reported on a triangle of Earth-sized baselines
(SMT-CARMA-JCMT) representing a new constraint upon the structure and
orientation of the emission region, independent from those provided by the
previously measured 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes alone. Here, we compare
this to the closure phases associated with a class of physically motivated,
radiatively inefficient accretion flow models, and present predictions for
future mm-VLBI experiments with the developing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).
We find that the accretion flow models are capable of producing a wide variety
of closure phases on the SMT-CARMA-JCMT triangle, and thus not all models are
consistent with the recent observations. However, those models that reproduce
the 1.3mm-VLBI visibility amplitudes overwhelmingly have SMT-CARMA-JCMT closure
phases between +-30 degrees, and are therefore broadly consistent with all
current mm-VLBI observations. Improving station sensitivity by factors of a
few, achievable by increases in bandwidth and phasing together multiple
antennas at individual sites, should result in physically relevant additional
constraints upon the model parameters and eliminate the current 180 degree
ambiguity on the source orientation. When additional stations are included,
closure phases of order 45--90 degrees are typical. In all cases the EHT will
be able to measure these with sufficient precision to produce dramatic
improvements in the constraints upon the spin of Sgr A*.

breakouts. Here we calculate the luminosity and spectrum that these breakouts
produce. In order to do so we improve an analytic description of relativistic
radiation mediated shocks and follow the system from the breakout itself,
through the planar phase and into the spherical phase. We limit our calculation
to cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planar
phase. (i.e., the final gas Lorentz factor <~30). We find that spherical
relativistic breakouts produce a flash of gamma-rays with energy, temperature,
and duration that always satisfy a specific relation between them as well as
providing the breakout radius and Lorentz factor. The breakout flare is
typically followed, on longer time scales, by X-rays that carry a comparable
energy. We apply our model to a variety of explosions, including Ia and .Ia
supernovae (SNe), AIC, energetic SNe and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find that
all these events produce detectable gamma-ray signals, some of which may have
already been seen. Some particular examples are: (i) Relativistic shock
breakouts provide a natural explanation to the energy, temperature and time
scales, as well as many other observed features, of all low luminosity GRBs.
(ii) Nearby broad-line Ib/c (like SN 2002ap) may produce a detectable gamma-ray
signal. (iii) Galactic Ia SNe produce detectable gamma-ray flares, if their
progenitors are single degenerate. We conclude that relativistic shock breakout
is a generic process for the production of gamma-ray flares, which opens a new
window for the study and detection of a variety of stellar explosions.

continua with a mean photon index, \Gamma =1.74 +/- 0.11, that is consistent
with measurements of lower redshift RLQs. These continua are likely dominated
by jet-linked X-ray emission, and they follow the expected anti-correlation
between photon index and radio loudness. We find no evidence of iron K\alpha ~
emission lines or Compton-reflection continua. Our data also constrain
intrinsic X-ray absorption in these RLQs. We find evidence for significant
absorption (N_H ~ 10^22 cm^-2) in one RLQ of our sample (SDSS J0011+1446); the
incidence of X-ray absorption in our sample appears plausibly consistent with
that for high-redshift RLQs that have higher values of radio loudness. In the
Chandra observation of PMN J221-2719 we detect apparent extended (~ 14 kpc)
X-ray emission that is most likely due to a jet; the X-ray luminosity of this
putative jet is ~2% that of the core. The analysis of a 4.9 GHz VLA image of
PMN J221-2719 reveals a structure that matches the X-ray extension found in
this source. We also find evidence for long-term (450-460 days) X-ray
variability by 80-100% in two of our targets.

D(2,1;alpha)^2, valid for all values of alpha. This construction relies on a
novel, alpha-dependent generalisation of the Zhukovsky map. We investigate the
weakly-coupled limit of this BA and of the all-loop BA for strings on AdS_3 x

that correspond to these weakly-coupled BAs. The spin-chains are alternating

giving some of the first hints about the unknown CFT2 dual to string theory on
AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1. We show that, in the alpha to 1 limit, the integrable
structure of the D(2,1;alpha) model is non-singular and keeps track of not just
massive but also massless modes. This provides a way of incorporating massless

biochemical reaction systems underlying cellular functions. The complexity and
functionality of such systems emerge not from the protein interactions
themselves but from the dependencies between these interactions. Therefore, a
comprehensive approach for integrating and using information about such
dependencies is required. Results: We present an approach for endowing protein
networks with interaction dependencies using propositional logic, thereby
obtaining protein hypernetworks. First we demonstrate how this framework
straightforwardly improves the prediction of protein complexes. Next we show
that modeling protein perturbations in hypernetworks, rather than in networks,
allows to better infer the functional necessity of proteins for yeast.
Furthermore, hypernetworks improve the prediction of synthetic lethal
interactions in yeast, indicating their capability to capture high-order
functional relations between proteins. Conclusion: Protein hypernetworks are a
consistent formal framework for modeling dependencies between protein
interactions within protein networks. First applications of protein
hypernetworks on the yeast interactome indicate their value for inferring
functional features of complex biochemical systems.

with influx and efflux is usually treated as a subsystem in a larger, closed
""universe"". It remains a question what the minimally required description for
the surrounding of such an open driven system is, so that its nonequilibrium
thermodynamics can be established solely based on the internal stochastic
kinetics. We provide a solution to this problem using insights from studies of
molecular motors in a chemical nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) with
sustained external drive through a regenerating system, or in a quasi-steady
state (QSS) with an excess amount of ATP, ADP, and Pi. We introduce the key
notion of {\em minimal work} that is needed, $W_{min}$, for the external
regenerating system to sustain a NESS ({\em e.g.}, maintaining constant
concentrations of ATP, ADP and Pi for a molecular motor). Using a Markov
(master-equation) description of a motor protein, we illustrate that the NESS
and QSS have identical kinetics as well as the Second Law in terms of a same
positive entropy production rate. The difference between the heat dissipation
of a NESS and its corresponding QSS is exactly the $W_{min}$. This provides a
justification for introducing an {\em ideal external regenerating system} and
yields a {\em free energy balance equation} between the net free energy input
$F_{in}$ and total dissipation $F_{dis}$ in an NESS: $F_{in}$ consists of
chemical input minus mechanical output; $F_{dis}$ consists of dissipative heat;
and the amount of useful energy becoming heat is the NESS entropy production.
Furthermore, we show that for non-stationary systems, the $F_{dis}$ and
$F_{in}$ correspond to the entropy production rate and housekeeping heat in
stochastic thermodynamics, and identify a relative entropy $H$ as a generalized
free energy.

found to be consistent with a F8 supergiant star (log L/L_{\odot}=4.92+/-0.20

this corresponds to a single star at the end of core C-burning with an initial
mass of M_{ZAMS}=13+/-3M_{\odot}. The possibility of the progenitor source
being a cluster is rejected, on the basis of: 1) the source is not spatially
extended; 2) the absence of excess H\alpha\, emission; and 3) the poor fit to
synthetic cluster SEDs. It is unclear if a binary companion is contributing to
the observed SED, although given the excellent correspondence of the observed
photometry to a single star SED we suggest the companion does not contribute
significantly. Early photometric and spectroscopic observations show fast
evolution similar to the transitional Type IIb SN 2008ax, and suggest that a

inject semantic information into normal memory trace. To the best of our
knowledge, the HMTT system is the first hardware tracing system capable of
correlating memory trace with high-level events. Comprehensive validations and

estimate efficiencies. The novel features of our quirky model includes:
quirkonium decay proceeds into a pair of gluon jets, without a b-jet component;
there is essentially no associated Zjj or gamma+jj signal; and there are
potentially new (parameter-dependent) contributions to dijet production,

Boolean networks can become canalized if they evolve through a frustrated

each node had K=3 inputs. Those networks evolve to a critical steady-state at
the boarder of two phases of dynamical behavior. Moreover, the evolution of
these networks was shown to be associated with the symmetry of the evolutionary

expressive version of predicates to describe refinement types. A Typed Scheme
program can use these refinement types to keep track of arbitrary classes of
values via the type system. Further, we show how the Typed Scheme type system,
in conjunction with simple recursive types, is able to encode refinements of
existing datatypes, thus expressing both proposed variations of refinement
types.

Einstein's equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions on fixed timelike
cut-off hypersurface. Using the fluid/gravity correspondence, we argue that one
can determine non-linear solutions to this problem in the long wavelength
regime. On the boundary we find a conformal fluid with Dirichlet constitutive
relations, viz., the fluid propagates on a `dynamical' background metric which
depends on the local fluid velocities and temperature. This boundary fluid can
be re-expressed as an emergent hypersurface fluid which is non-conformal but
has the same value of the shear viscosity as the boundary fluid. The
hypersurface dynamics arises as a collective effect, wherein effects of the
background are transmuted into the fluid degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that this collective fluid is forced to be non-relativistic below a
critical cut-off radius in AdS to avoid acausal sound propagation with respect
to the hypersurface metric. We further go on to show how one can use this
set-up to embed the recent constructions of flat spacetime duals to
non-relativistic fluid dynamics into the AdS/CFT correspondence, arguing that a
version of the membrane paradigm arises naturally when the boundary fluid lives
on a background Galilean manifold.

representation of a data object for a network of mobile storage nodes so as to
achieve the optimal recovery delay. A source node creates a single data object
and disseminates an encoded representation of it to other nodes for storage,
subject to a given total storage budget. A data collector node subsequently
attempts to recover the original data object by contacting other nodes and
accessing the data stored in them. By using an appropriate code, successful
recovery is achieved when the total amount of data accessed is at least the
size of the original data object. The goal is to find an allocation of the
given budget over the nodes that optimizes the recovery delay incurred by the
data collector; two objectives are considered: (i) maximization of the
probability of successful recovery by a given deadline, and (ii) minimization
of the expected recovery delay. We solve the problem completely for the second
objective in the case of symmetric allocations (in which all nonempty nodes
store the same amount of data), and show that the optimal symmetric allocation
for the two objectives can be quite different. A simple data dissemination and
storage protocol for a mobile delay-tolerant network is evaluated under various
scenarios via simulations. Our results show that the choice of storage
allocation can have a significant impact on the recovery delay performance, and
that coding may or may not be beneficial depending on the circumstances.

and structure of high-ionization line (e.g. CIV) emitting regions in active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). Two kinds of broad emission line region (BELR) models
have been proposed, outflow and gravitationally bound BELR, which are supported
respectively by blueshift of the CIV line and reverberation mapping
observations. To reconcile these two apparently different models, we present a
detailed comparison study between the CIV and MgII lines using a sample of AGNs
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the kinematics of the
CIV region is different from that of MgII, which is thought to be controlled by
gravity. A strong correlation is found between the blueshift and asymmetry of
the CIV profile and the Eddington ratio. This provides strong observational
support for the postulation that the outflow is driven by radiation pressure.
In particular, we find robust evidence that the CIV line region is largely
dominated by outflow at high Eddington ratios, while it is primarily
gravitationally bounded at low Eddington ratios. Our results indicate that
these two emitting regions coexist in most of AGNs. The emission strength from
these two gases varies smoothly with Eddington ratio in opposite ways. This
explanation naturally reconciles the apparently contradictory views proposed in
previous studies. Finally, candidate models are discussed which can account for
both, the enhancement of outflow emission and suppression of normal BEL, in AGN
with high Eddington ratios.

such that $\mathscr{I}(d)$ is generated by its global sections. It is now clear
that the asymptotic behavior of $\reg \mathscr{I}^t$ is governed by $s$ but

constant $e$. We then turn to concrete geometric settings to study the
asymptotic regularity of $\mathscr{I}$ in the case that $X$ is a nonsingular

regularity bounds for $\mathscr{I}^t$ once we know $\reg \mathscr{I}$ and

warped disc interacts with the fast stellar wind. We suggest that tides from a
misaligned companion neutron star can cause the observed effects. We make
numerical models of a Be star decretion disc in which the spin of the Be star
is misaligned with the orbital axis of a neutron star companion. Tidal torques
from the neutron star truncate the disc at a radius small enough that the
neutron star orbit does not intersect the disc unless the eccentricity or
misalignment is very large. A magnetic torque from the Be star that is largest
at the equator, where the rotation is fastest, is approximated by an inner
boundary condition. There are large oscillations in the mass and inclination of
the disc as it moves towards a steady state. These large variations may explain
the observed changes from Be star to Be shell star and vice-versa and also the
Type II X-ray outbursts. We find the tidal timescale on which the disc warps,
precesses and reaches a steady state to be around a year up to a few hundred
years. If present, the oscillations in mass and disc inclination occur on a
fraction of this timescale depending on the orbital parameters of the binary.
The timescales associated with the tidal torque for observed Be star binaries
suggest that these effects are important in all but the longest period
binaries.

states or entanglement is not efficiently translatable into the classical

principals of flow conservation and capacity constrains we also speculate how
this flow might seeks some equilibrium and exhibit self-correction codes. This
proposed model allows us to account for perturbations in form of local noise,
evolution of networks, provide robustness against local damage from lower

approaches for de novo genome assembly. A major limitation of this approach is
the large computational memory space requirement to construct the de Bruijn
graph, which scales with k-mer length and total diversity (N) of unique k-mers
in the genome expressed in base pairs or roughly (2k+8)N bits. This limitation
is particularly important with large-scale genome analysis and for sequencing
centers that simultaneously process multiple genomes. We present a sparse de
Bruijn graph structure, based on which we developed SparseAssembler that
greatly reduces memory space requirements. The structure also allows us to
introduce a novel method for the removal of substitution errors introduced
during sequencing. The sparse de Bruijn graph structure skips g intermediate
k-mers, therefore reducing the theoretical memory space requirement to
~(2k/g+8)N. We have found that a practical value of g=16 consumes approximately
10% of the memory required by standard de Bruijn graph-based algorithms but
yields comparable results. A high error rate could potentially derail the
SparseAssembler. Therefore, we developed a sparse de Bruijn graph-based
denoising algorithm that can remove more than 99% of substitution errors from
datasets with a \leq 2% error rate. Given that substitution error rates for the
current generation of sequencers is lower than 1%, our denoising procedure is
sufficiently effective to safeguard the performance of our algorithm. Finally,
we also introduce a novel Dijkstra-like breadth-first search algorithm for the
sparse de Bruijn graph structure to circumvent residual errors and resolve
polymorphisms.

protoneutron star. By a post-processing calculation, we evaluate abundances and
masses of the SN ejecta for nuclei with the mass number $\le 70$ employing a
large nuclear reaction network. Aspherical abundance distributions, which are
observed in nearby core-collapse SN remnants, are obtained for the non-rotating
spherically-symmetric progenitor, due to the growth of low-mode SASI. Abundance
pattern of the supernova ejecta is similar to that of the solar system for
models whose masses ranges $(0.4-0.5) \Ms$ of the ejecta from the inner region
($\le 10,000\km$) of the precollapse core. For the models, the explosion
energies and the \nuc{Ni}{56} masses are $ \simeq 10^{51} \rm erg$ and
$(0.05-0.06) \Ms$, respectively; their estimated baryonic masses of the neutron
star are comparable to the ones observed in neutron-star binaries. These
findings may have little uncertainty because most of the ejecta is composed by
matter that is heated via the shock wave and has relatively definite
abundances. The abundance ratios for Ne, Mg, Si and Fe observed in Cygnus loop

Hydrogen-Deuteride (HD) gas for a polarized HD target in LEPS experiments at
SPring-8. A small amount of ortho-H$_2$ ($\sim$0.01%) in the HD gas plays an
important role in efficiently polarizing the HD target. Since there are
1$\sim$5% impurities of H$_2$ and D$_2$ in commercially available HD gases, it
is inevitable that the HD gas is purified up to $\sim$99.99%. The distillation
system has a cryogenic pot (17$\sim$21 K) containing many small stainless steel
cells called Heli-pack. Commercial HD gas with an amount of 5.2 mol is fed into
the pot. We carried out three distillation runs by changing temperatures (17.5
K and 20.5 K) and gas extraction speeds (1.3 ml/min and 5.2 ml/min). The
extracted gas was analyzed by using a gas analyzer system combining a
quadrupole mass spectrometer with a gas chromatograph. The HD gas of 1 mol with
a purity better than 99.99% has been successfully obtained. The effective NTS
(Number of Theoretical Stages), which is an indicator of the distillator
performances, is obtained as 37.2$\pm$0.6. This value is in reasonable
agreement with a designed value of 37.9. The HD target is expected to be
efficiently polarized under a well-controlled condition by doping an optimal
amount of ortho-H$_2$ to the purified HD gas.

significantly magnetized. A realistic magnetic field of moderate strength has
been shown to suppress, through catastrophic magnetic braking, the formation of
a rotationally supported disk during the protostellar accretion phase of
low-mass star formation in the ideal MHD limit. We address, through 2D
(axisymmetric) simulations, the question of whether realistic levels of
nonideal effects, computed with a simplified chemical network including dust
grains, can weaken the magnetic braking enough to enable a rotationally
supported disk to form. We find that ambipolar diffusion, the dominant nonideal
MHD effect over most of the density range relevant to disk formation, does not
enable disk formation, at least in 2D. The reason is that ambipolar diffusion
allows the magnetic flux that would be dragged into the central stellar object
in the ideal MHD limit to pile up instead in a small circumstellar region,
where the magnetic field strength (and thus the braking efficiency) is greatly
enhanced. We also find that, on the scale of tens of AU or more, a realistic
level of Ohmic dissipation does not weaken the magnetic braking enough for a
rotationally supported disk to form, either by itself or in combination with
ambipolar diffusion. The Hall effect, the least explored of these three
nonideal MHD effects, can spin up the material close to the central object to a
significant, supersonic rotation speed, even when the core is initially
non-rotating, although the spun-up material remains too sub-Keplerian to form a
rotationally supported disk. The problem of catastrophic magnetic braking that
prevents disk formation in dense cores magnetized to realistic levels remains
unresolved. Possible resolutions of this problem are discussed.

critical core mass for gas giant formation and the gas accretion time-scales.
In the core-accretion model, runaway gas accretion is triggered after a core
reaches a critical core mass. All the previous studies on the core-accretion
model assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,
the envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals
because icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via
strong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope. In
this paper, we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the
critical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of
the increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature
gradient. Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form
massive envelopes before disc dissipation. Our results suggest that envelope
pollution in the course of planetary accretion has the potential to trigger gas
giant formation with small cores. We propose that it is necessary to take into
account envelope pollution by icy planetesimals when we discuss gas giant
formation based on the core-accretion model.

are in excellent agreement with the spin excitations obtained by exact
diagonalization of the $\bf t-J$ Hamiltonian on finite-sized clusters. The
comprehensive experimental description of this surprisingly simple spectrum
permits quantitative tests of magnetic Cooper pairing models. A numerical
solution of the Eliashberg equations for the magnetic spectrum of
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7}$ reproduces its superconducting transition temperature
within a factor of two, a level of agreement comparable to Eliashberg theories

calculating the modulation of the effective interaction and the number of

pump-photon-energy-dependent pathways are confirmed to be realized from the
finding that, although the effective interaction is always and slowly weakened,
the introduction of carriers is sensitive to the pump-photon energy and
proceeds much faster.

However, two or infinitely many NE in PS might also be observed with zero

at energies above 10^13 eV is performed through the detection of Extensive Air

anisotropies are small, so accurate measurements require small statistical
uncertainties, i.e. large datasets. These can be obtained by employing ground
detector arrays with large extensions (from 10^4 to 10^9 m^2) and long
operation time (up to 20 years). The control of such arrays is challenging and
spurious variations in the counting rate due to instrumental effects (e.g. data
taking interruptions or changes in the acceptance) and atmospheric effects
(e.g. air temperature and pressure effects on EAS development) are usually
present. These modulations must be corrected very precisely before performing
standard anisotropy analyses, i.e. harmonic analysis of the counting rate
versus local sidereal time. In this paper we discuss an alternative method to
measure large scale anisotropies, the ""East-West method"", originally proposed
by Nagashima in 1989. It is a differential method, as it is based on the
analysis of the difference of the counting rates in the East and West
directions. Besides explaining the principle, we present here its mathematical
derivation, showing that the method is largely independent of experimental
effects, that is, it does not require corrections for acceptance and/or for
atmospheric effects. We explain the use of the method to derive the amplitude
and phase of the anisotropy and we demonstrate its power under different

properties of a complete sample of ~1300 galaxies down to log M*=9.5 at
redshifts 1.5<z<3. Eight percent of the sample is made up of massive galaxies
with M*>10^11 Msun. We derive optical colours, dust extinctions, and
ultraviolet and infrared SFR to determine how the star formation rate changes
as a function of both stellar mass and time. Our results show that SFR
increases at higher stellar mass such that massive galaxies nearly double their
stellar mass from star formation alone over the redshift range studied, but the
average value of SFR for a given stellar mass remains constant over this 2 Gyr
period. Furthermore, we find no strong evolution in the SFR for our sample as a
function of mass over our redshift range of interest, in particular we do not
find a decline in the SFR among massive galaxies, as is seen at z < 1. The most
massive galaxies in our sample (log M*>11) have high average SFRs with values,
SFR(UV,corr) = 103+/-75 Msun/yr, yet exhibit red rest-frame (U-B) colours at

science, and fair sharing of resources has aroused renewed interest with the
advent of virtualization and cloud computing. Prior work has typically focused
on mechanisms for fair sharing of a single resource. We provide a new
definition for the simultaneous fair allocation of multiple
continuously-divisible resources. Roughly speaking, we define fairness as the
situation where every user either gets all the resources he wishes for, or else
gets at least his entitlement on some bottleneck resource, and therefore cannot
complain about not getting more. This definition has the same desirable
properties as the recently suggested dominant resource fairness, and also
handles the case of multiple bottlenecks. We then prove that a fair allocation
according to this definition is guaranteed to exist for any combination of user
requests and entitlements (where a user's relative use of the different
resources is fixed). The proof, which uses tools from the theory of ordinary
differential equations, is constructive and provides a method to compute the
allocations numerically.

  In considering IDAs collectively, we found that there was no generic

forward such a description here. In our description, IDAs are functionality
separated into three logic layers, which are designed and built individually.
Each layer is represented by functionality on the software client running on
each participating computer, which together comprise the overall IDA.
  The core contribution of this work is a framework, called the Internet
Distributed Application Framework (IDAF), which outlines how IDAs can be
designed, built and run. The IDAF outlines a set of constraints that each
implementing software system must abide by. To verify the IDAF, we have built a
system prototype implementation called the Internet Distributed Application
System (IDAS). The IDAS includes an implementation of the IDAF layer model,
which specifies IDAs are built. The IDAS also includes a generic software
client that is capable of simultaneously running and managing arbitrary IDAs.
We provide sample IDAs and demonstrations to verify both that the IDAF is
implementable and that the IDAS is a workable usable system.

investigated with numerical simulations. The ice-condensing region in the disk
is obtained by calculating the temperature and the density with the 1+1D
approach. The snow line migrates as the mass accretion rate (\dot{M}) in the
disk decreases with time. Calculations are carried out from an early phase with
high disk accretion rates (\dot{M} \sim 10^{-7} M_sun/yr) to a later phase with
low disk accretion rates (\dot{M} \sim 10^{-12} M_sun/yr) using the same
numerical method. It is found that the snow line moves inward for \dot{M} >
10^{-10} M_sun/yr, while it gradually moves outward in the later evolution
phase with \dot{M} < 10^{-10} M_sun/yr. In addition to the silicate opacity,
the ice opacity is taken into consideration. In the inward migration phase, the
additional ice opacity increases the distance of the snow line from the central
star by a factor of 1.3 for dust grains < 10 micro-meter in size and 1.6 for >
100 micro-meter. It is inevitable that the snow line comes inside the Earth's
orbit in the course of the disk evolution, if the alpha viscosity parameter is
in a range 0.001-0.1, the dust-to-gas mass ratio is higher than a tenth of the
solar abundance value, and the dust grains are smaller than 1 mm. The formation
of water-devoid planetesimals in the terrestrial planet region seems to be
difficult throughout the disk evolution, which imposes a new challenge to

XML specification for quantum computing (QIS-XML). QIS-XML is a proposed
framework, based on the widely used standard (XML) to describe, visualize,
exchange and process quantum gates and quantum circuits. It also provides a
potential approach to a generic programming language for quantum computers
through the concept of XML driven compilers. Examples are provided for the
description of commonly used quantum gates and circuits, accompanied with tools
to visualize them in standard web browsers. An algorithmic example is also
presented, performing a simple addition operation with quantum circuits and
running the program on a quantum computer simulator. Overall, this initial
effort demonstrates how XML technologies could be at the core of the
architecture for describing and programming quantum computers. By leveraging a
widely accepted standard, QIS-XML also builds a bridge between classic and
quantum IT, which could foster the acceptance of QIS by the ICT community and
facilitate the understanding of quantum technology by IT experts. This would
support the consolidation of Classic Information Science and Quantum
Information Science into a Complete Information Science, a challenge that could
be referred to as the ""Information Science Grand Unification Challenge"".

onion-like velocity structure in [FeII] in the blueshifted jet, similar to that
observed in optical lines. High-velocity gas at ~-200 km/s is collimated inside
a half-opening angle of 4 degrees and medium-velocity gas at ~-100 km/s in a
cone with an half-opening angle 14 degrees. Two new axial jet knots are
detected in the blue jet, as well as a more distant bubble with corresponding
counter-bubble. The periodic knot ejection timescale is revised downward to 2.5
yrs. The redshifted jet is detected only beyond 0.7"" from the star, yielding
revised constraints on the disk surface density. From comparison to [OI] data
we infer iron depletion of a factor 3 at high velocities and a factor 10 at
speeds below -100 km/s. The mass-fluxes in each of the medium and high-velocity
components of the blueshifted lobe are ~1.6+-0.8x10^-8 Msun/yr, representing
0.02-0.2 of the disk accretion rate. The medium-velocity conical [FeII] flow in
the DG Tau jet is too fast and too narrow to trace photo-evaporated matter from
the disk atmosphere. Both its kinematics and collimation cannot be reproduced
by the X-wind, nor can the ""conical magnetospheric wind"". The level of Fe gas
phase depletion in the DG Tau medium-velocity component also rules out a
stellar wind and a cocoon ejected sideways from the high-velocity beam. A
quasi-steady centrifugal MHD disk wind ejected over 0.25-1.5 AU and/or episodic
magnetic tower cavities launched from the disk appear as the most plausible
origins for the medium velocity component in the DG Tau jet. The same disk wind

fragmented because of occlusions and misdetections. Therefore, we also propose
a trajectory filtering, named global tracker, aims at removing the noisy

models are needed), (ii) the tracker is more reliable by combining multiple
feature similarities, (iii) the tracker can perform in different scene
conditions: single/several mobile objects, weak/strong illumination,

improve the tracker performance, (v) the tracker performance outperforms many

Examples include the use of cameras by regulators collecting evidence of Mafia

leaked information from the photographs themselves. We call this the camera
location detection attack. We propose and review defense techniques against

7--16 May 1997. Analyses of H{\alpha} filtergrams and MDI/SOHO magnetograms
revealed continual but discrete surge activity, and emergence and cancellation
of flux in this active region. The movie of these magnetograms revealed two
important results that the major opposite polarities of pre-existing region as
well as in the emerging flux region (EFR) were approaching towards each other
and moving magnetic features (MMF) were ejecting out from the major north
polarity at a quasi-periodicity of about ten hrs during 10--13 May 1997. These
activities were probably caused by the magnetic reconnection in the lower
atmosphere driven by photospheric convergence motions, which were evident in
magnetograms. The magnetic field variations such as flux, gradient, and sunspot
rotation revealed that free energy was slowly being stored in the corona. The
slow low-layer magnetic reconnection may be responsible for this storage and
the formation of a sigmoidal core field or a flux rope leading to the eventual
eruption. The occurrence of EUV brightenings in the sigmoidal core field prior
to the rise of a flux rope suggests that the eruption was triggered by the
inner tether-cutting reconnection, but not the external breakout reconnection.
An impulsive acceleration revealed from fast separation of the H{\alpha}
ribbons of the first 150 seconds suggests the CME accelerated in the inner
corona, which is consistent with the temporal profile of the reconnection
electric field. In conclusion, we propose a qualitative model in view of

CME, and subsequent flare.

and mean-square angular momenta of captured systems are revealed in the
reactions with deformed nuclei at subbarrier energies. The calculated results
are in a good agreement with existing experimental data. With decreasing
bombarding energy under the barrier the external turning point of the
nucleusnucleus potential leaves the region of short-range nuclear interaction
and action of friction. Because of this change of the regime of interaction, an
unexpected enhancement of the capture cross section is expected at bombarding
energies far below the Coulomb barrier. This effect is shown its worth in the
dependence of mean-square angular momentum of captured system on the bombarding
energy. From the comparison of calculated and experimental capture cross
sections, the importance of quasifission near the entrance channel is shown for
the actinide-based reactions leading to superheavy nuclei.

only the helicity conserving (HC) amplitudes survive asymptotically. Studying a
large number of such processes, at the 1loop Electroweak (EW) order, it is now
found that their high energy HC amplitudes are determined by just three forms:
a log-squared function of the ratio of two of the (s,t,u) variables, to which a
pi^2 is added; and two Sudakov-like ln- and ln^2-terms accompanied by
respective mass-dependent constants. Apart from an additional residual
constant, all high energy HC amplitudes, may be expressed as linear
combinations of the above three forms, with coefficients being rational
functions of the $(s,t,u)$ variables. We call this fact supersimplicity.
Applying to the $ug\to dW$ amplitudes, for which the complete 1loop expressions
are available, we find that supersimplicity may be a very good approximation at
LHC energies, provided the SUSY scale is not too high. SM processes are also
discussed, and their differences are explored.

up of -2x10^-4 h/h during the outburst. This spin up is confirmed by the pulse
period evolution calculated from Swift/BAT data. The Swift/BAT data also show a
long spin-down trend prior to the 2008 outburst, which is confirmed in archival

behaviors on the two PESs. The reactivity on the RKHS PES is found to be
considerably larger than that on the DMBE/CBS PES. The observed differences
have their origin in two major distinct topography features. Although both PESs
are essentially barrierless for equilibrium H--H distances, when the H--H bond
is compressed the DMBE/CBS PES gives rise to a dynamical barrier which limits
the reactivity of the system. This barrier is completely absent in the RHKS
PES. In addition, the latter PES exhibits a van der Walls well in the entrance
channel which reduces the height of the centrifugal barrier and is able to
support resonances. As a result a significant larger cross section is found on

the opening of partial wave contributions.

BEaming, Ellipsoidal and the Reflection/heating periodic modulations, induced
by short-period non-transiting low-mass companions. The beaming effect is due
to the increase (decrease) of the brightness of any light source approaching
(receding from) the observer. To first order, the beaming and the
reflection/heating effects modulate the stellar brightness at the orbital
period, with phases separated by a quarter of a period, whereas the ellipsoidal
effect is modulated with the orbital first harmonic. The phase and harmonic
differences between the three modulations allow the algorithm to search for a
combination of the three effects and identify stellar candidates for low-mass
companions. The paper presents the algorithm, including an assignment of a
likelihood factor to any possible detection, based on the expected ratio of the
beaming and ellipsoidal effects, given an order-of-magnitude estimate of the
three effects. As predicted by Loeb & Gaudi (2003) and Zucker, Mazeh &

allow detection of massive planets and brown-dwarf/low-mass-stellar companions

relatively high temperature (~ 1000 K), likely indicating that shocks are
occurring in a time shorter than that needed for a complete para to ortho

between 10^6-10^7 cm^-3; moreover we demonstrate, based on the detections of HD

consistent with predictions of multiple C-type bow shocks with a range of

quantitatively similar to that of other abundant molecules emitting in the

any Laplace isospectral collection of orbifolds with sectional curvature
uniformly bounded below and having only isolated singular points also contains
only finitely many orbifold homeomorphism types. The main steps of the argument
are to show that any sequence from the collection has subsequence that

variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. In this paper, we propose
another interpretation of the observational data on the quasar absorption

spacetime is characterized by the Finsler geometry instead of the Riemann one.
The Finsler geometry admits fewer symmetries than the Riemann geometry does. We
investigate the Finslerian geodesic equations in the Randers spacetime (a
special Finsler spacetime). It is found that the cosmological redshift in this
spacetime deviates from the one in general relativity. The modification term to
the redshift could be generally revealed as a monopole plus dipole function of
spacetime locations and directions. We suggest that this modification
corresponds to the spatial monopole and dipole of $\alpha$ variation in the
quasar absorption spectra.

work in three dimensions. The results are all generalisable to higher

electromagnetic analogy is a useful starting point for calculating asymptotic
results at low temperature that can be compared with direct numerical
evaluations. We also examine the problems that arise in a direct numerical
simulation of the stochastic equation together with the slave equations. We pay
special attention to the dependence of the slave variable statistics on

approaches, the scalability of media and scalability of features remain an
issue. In our work we tackle the problem of scalability and structural

upon sets of SURF feature points with Delaunay triangulation. A
Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) framework is applied on these graphs, giving birth
to a Bag-of-Graph-Words representation. The nested nature of the descriptors
consists in scaling from trivial Delaunay graphs - isolated feature points - by
increasing the number of nodes layer by layer up to graphs with maximal number
of nodes. For each layer of graphs its proper visual dictionary is built. The
experiments conducted on the SIVAL data set reveal that the graph features at
different layers exhibit complementary performances on the same content. The
nested approach, the combination of all existing layers, yields significant
improvement of the object recognition performance compared to single level

as, $\mu_o=exp(B/T)$, where $B$ is a physico-chemical parameter depending on
the type of oil, and $T$ is the temperature. A temperature gradient is applied
across the medium in the flow direction. Initially, the porous medium is
saturated with oil and, then, another fluid is injected. We have considered two
cases representing different injection strategies. In the first case, the
invading fluid viscosity is constant (finite viscosity ratio) while in the
second one, the invading fluid is inviscid (infinite viscosity ratio). Our
results show that, for the case of finite viscosity ratio, recovery increases
with $\Delta T$ independently on strength or sign of the gradient. For an
infinite viscosity ratio, a positive temperature gradient is necessary to
enhance recovery. Moreover, we show that, for $\Delta T>0$, the percentage of
oil recovery generally decreases (increases) with $B$ for a finite (infinite)
viscosity ratio. Finally, we also extend our results for infinite viscosity
ratio to a three-dimensional porous media geometry.

between the red giant branch (RGB) bump and a point on the main sequence (MS)
at the same color as the bump, the ""benchmark"" - to estimate the helium content
in old stellar systems. Its sensitivity to helium is linear over the entire
metallicity range, it is minimally affected by age, uncertainties in the
photometric zero-point, reddening or the effects of evolution on the horizontal
branch. The two main drawbacks are the need for precise and large photometric
data sets, and a strong dependence of the {\Delta}Y/{\Delta}{\xi} slope on
metallicity. To test the {\Delta}{\xi} parameter we selected 22 Galactic
Globular Clusters (GGCs) with low foreground reddening, a broad range of iron
abundance and precise, relatively deep, and homogeneous multi-band (B,V,I)
photometry. We found that the observed {\Delta}{\xi} and those predicted from
{\alpha}-enhanced models agree quite well if we assume Y=0.20. Comparison with
canonical primordial helium content models (Y=0.245, {\Delta}Y/{\Delta}Z=1.4)
indicates that the observed {\Delta}{\xi} values are systematically smaller
than predicted. The outcome is the same if predicted parameters are based on
models that take into account also CNO enhancements and becomes even larger if
we consider He-enhanced models. These findings suggest that current stellar
evolutionary models overestimate the luminosity of the RGB bump. We also found
that including envelope overshooting can eliminate the discrepancy, as
originally suggested by Alongi et al. (1993, aaps, 97, 851). The {\Delta}{\xi}
parameter of GGCs, in spite of the possible limitations concerning the input
physics of current evolutionary models, provides an independent detection of
pre-stellar helium at least at the 5{\sigma} level.

(possibly with punctures/boundary) does not virtually surject onto $\Z$ if the
genus of the surface is large. We prove that if this conjecture holds for some
genus, then it also holds for all larger genera. We also prove that if there is
a counterexample to this conjecture, then there must be a counterexample of a
particularly simple form. We prove these results by relating the conjecture to
a family of linear representations of the mapping class group that we call the
higher Prym representations. They generalize the classical symplectic
representation.

(LHC) running at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is reported, based on a total
integrated luminosity of up to 40 pb^-1 collected by the ATLAS detector in
2010. Several Higgs boson decay channels: H -> {\gamma}{\gamma}, H -> ZZ (*) ->
llll, H -> ZZ -> ll{\nu}{\nu}, H -> ZZ -> llqq, H -> W W (*) -> l{\nu}l{\nu}
and H -> W W -> l{\nu}qq (l is e, {\mu}) are combined in a mass range from 110
GeV to 600 GeV. The highest sensitivity is achieved in the mass range between
160 GeV and 170 GeV, where the expected 95% CL exclusion sensitivity is at
Higgs boson production cross sections 2.3 times the Standard Model prediction.
Upper limits on the cross section for its production are determined. Models
with a fourth generation of heavy leptons and quarks with Standard Model-like
couplings to the Higgs boson are also investigated and are excluded for a Higgs
boson mass in the range from 140 GeV to 185 GeV.

structure of silicon, as a novel allotrope with nanotubular holes along two
perpendicular directions, is stable. The calculations on geometrical and
electronic properties reveal that this allotrope possesses a direct band gap
wider by 0.5eV than the indirect one of silicon with diamond structure. The
crystal belongs to I41/AMD space group, showing anisotropic optical properties
and Young modulus. The bulk modulus is 64.4GPa and the density is
1.9g/cm$^{3}$, lower than that of the diamond silicon due to the presence of
nanotubular holes. It is hopeful that the allotrope may widely expand
applications of silicon in many fields due to its direct band gap and specific
nanotubular structure.

big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) are dominated by uncertainties in the input
nuclear reaction rates. We investigate the effect of modifying these reaction
rates on light element abundance yields in BBN by replacing the thirty-five
reaction rates out of the existing eighty-eight. We have studied these yields
as functions of evolution time or temperature. We find that using these new
reaction rates results in only a little increase in helium mass fraction over
that obtained previously in BBN calculations. This allows insights into the
role of the nuclear reaction rates in the setting of the neutron-to-proton
ratio during the BBN epoch. We observe that even with considerable nuclear
physics uncertainties, most of these nuclear reactions have minimal effect on
the standard BBN abundance yields of $^6$Li and $^7$Li.

results. We start by giving proof of two important theorems on the existence of
the and Clifford algebras. This last algebra gives proof of the von Neumann
basic postulates on the quantum measurement explaining thus in an algebraic
manner the wave function collapse postulated in standard quantum theory. In
this manner we reach the objective to expose a self-consistent version of
quantum mechanics. We give proof of the quantum like Heisenberg uncertainty
relations, the phenomenon of quantum Mach Zender interference as well as
quantum collapse in some cases of physical interest We also discuss the problem
of time evolution of quantum systems as well as the changes in space location.
We also give demonstration of the Kocken-Specher theorem, and also we give an
algebraic formulation and explanation of the EPR . By using the same approach
we also derive Bell inequalities. Our formulation is strongly based on the use
of idempotents that are contained in Clifford algebra. Their counterpart in
quantum mechanics is represented by the projection operators that are
interpreted as logical statements, following the basic von Neumann results.
Using the Clifford algebra we are able to invert such result. According to the
results previously obtained by Orlov in 1994, we are able to give proof that
quantum mechanics derives from logic. We show that indeterminism and quantum
interference have their origin in the logic.

neutron-rich 6He from polarized protons at 71 MeV/nucleon making use of a newly
constructed solid polarized proton target operated in a low magnetic field and
at high temperature. Two approaches based on local one-body potentials were
applied to investigate the spin-orbit interaction between a proton and a 6He
nucleus. An optical model analysis revealed that the spin-orbit potential for
6He is characterized by a shallow and long-ranged shape compared with the
global systematics of stable nuclei. A semimicroscopic analysis with a
alpha+n+n cluster folding model suggests that the interaction between a proton
and the alpha core is essentially important in describing the p+6He elastic
scattering. The data are also compared with fully microscopic analyses using
non-local optical potentials based on nucleon-nucleon g-matrices.
