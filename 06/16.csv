by aqueous atmospheric aerosols is a likely source of particulate organic
material. The aqueous-phase secondary organic products of some cVOCs are
surface-active. Therefore, cVOC uptake can lead to organic film formation at
the gas-aerosol interface and changes in aerosol surface tension. We examined
the chemical reactions of two abundant cVOCs, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, in
water and aqueous ammonium sulfate (AS) solutions mimicking tropospheric
aerosols. Secondary organic products were identified using Aerosol Chemical
Ionization Mass Spectrometry (Aerosol-CIMS), and changes in surface tension
were monitored using pendant drop tensiometry. Hemiacetal oligomers and aldol
condensation products were identified using Aerosol-CIMS. Acetaldehyde
depresses surface tension to 65(\pm2) dyn/cm in pure water (a 10% surface
tension reduction from that of pure water) and 62(\pm1) dyn/cm in AS solutions
(a 20.6% reduction from that of a 3.1 M AS solution). Surface tension
depression by formaldehyde in pure water is negligible; in AS solutions, a 9%
reduction in surface tension is observed. Mixtures of these species were also
studied in combination with methylglyoxal in order to evaluate the influence of
cross-reactions on surface tension depression and product formation in these
systems. We find that surface tension depression in the solutions containing
mixed cVOCs exceeds that predicted by an additive model based on the
single-species isotherms.

the dependence is to be long-ranged in this case, a finding that we confirm

linewidth and column density of interstellar clouds do not agree with simple
virial equilibrium (VE) as a balance between gravitational and kinetic energies
in the sense that the clouds either have too much kinetic energy or too little
mass to be bound. This may be explained by violation of VE as suggested by
Dobbs et al 2011, by observational underestimation of the masses as suggested
by Heyer et al 2009, or by an external pressure acting as an additional
confining force as suggested earlier by Heyer et al 2004. The data of Heyer et
al. 2009 cannot be explained with a single value for the external pressure, but
if different clouds in the sample have different external pressures in the
range of Pe/k = E4 to E7 cm-3 K, then most of the clouds could be in pressure
virial equilibrium (PVE). In this paper we discuss two consequences of the
external pressure. First, we show that the observational data are consistent
with the hypothesis (Chie\'ze 1987) that most clouds are at a critical mass for
dynamical stability determined solely by the pressure. Above this mass a cloud
is unstable to gravitational collapse or fragmentation. Second, we show that
the external pressure modifies the well-known size-linewidth relationship first
proposed by Larson (1981) so that the proportionality is no longer constant but
depends on the external pressure.

often extreme and associated with accretion at high Eddington ratios. Here we
present a study on a sample of 14 NLSy1 galaxies selected at hard X-rays (> 20
keV) from the fourth INTEGRAL/IBIS catalogue. The 20-100 keV IBIS spectra show
hard X-ray photon indeces flatly distributed (Gamma_{20-100 keV} ranging from
~1.3 to ~3.6) with an average value of <Gamma_{20-100 keV}> = 2.3+/-0.7,
compatible with a sample of hard X-ray BLSy1 average slope. Instead, NLSy1 show
steeper spectral indeces with respect to BLSy1 when broad-band spectra are
considered. Indeed, we combine XMM-Newton and Swift/XRT with INTEGRAL/IBIS data
sets to obtain a wide energy spectral coverage (0.3-100 keV). A constraint on
the high energy cut-off and on the reflection component is achieved only in one
source, Swift J2127.4+5654 (E_{cut-off} ~ 50 keV, R=1.0{+0.5}_{-0.4}). Hard
X-ray selected NLSy1 do not display particularly strong soft excess emission,
while absorption fully or partially covering the continuum is often measured as
well as Fe line emission features. Variability is a common trait in this
sample, both at X-ray and at hard X-rays. The fraction of NLSy1 in the hard
X-ray sky is likely to be ~15%, in agreement with estimates derived in
optically selected NLSy1 samples. We confirm the association of NLSy1 with
small black hole masses with a peak at 10^{7} M_{dot} in the distribution,
however hard X-ray NLSy1 seem to occupy the lower tail of the Eddington ratios

question as to whether the iron-based high-Tc's could be viewed as doped Mott
insulators like the cuprates. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) evidence of two insulating and one semiconducting phases
of KxFe2-ySe2, and the mesoscopic phase separation between the
superconducting/semiconducting phase and the insulating phases. The insulating
phases are characterized by the depletion of electronic states over a 0.5 eV
window below the chemical potential, giving a compelling evidence for the
presence of Mott-like physics. The charging effects and the absence of band
folding in the superconducting/semiconducting phase further prove that the
static magnetic and vacancy orders are not related to the superconductivity.
Instead, the electronic structure of the superconducting phase is much closer
to the semiconducting phase, indicating the superconductivity is likely
developed by doping the semiconducting phase rather than the insulating phases.

investigated a reformulation of Einstein's gravity where the pseudo-riemannian

the Weyl geometry and it is shown that it gives extra contributions to the
trajectories of test particles, serving as one more motivation to study general
relativity in Weyl geometry. It is introduced its variational formalism and it
is established the coupling with other physical fields in such a way that the
theory acquires a gauge symmetry for the geometrical fields. It is shown that
this symmetry is still present for the red-shift and it is concluded that for
cosmological models it opens the possibility that observations can be fully
described by the new geometrical scalar field. It is concluded then that this
reformulation, although representing a theoretical advance, still needs a

defined on the logarithmic cover of the complex plane with values in the
bounded operators between weighted L^2-spaces. This allows for a construction
of generalized eigenforms for the Laplace operator as well as for a meromorphic
continuation of the scattering matrix. We give a precise description of the
asymptotic expansion of generalized eigenforms on the cusp and find that the

biofilms in vivo, can swarm over hard surfaces and form concentric ring
patterns in colonies. Colony formation involves two distinct cell types:
swarmer cells that dominate near the surface and the leading edge, and swimmer
cells that prefer a less viscous medium, but the mechanisms underlying pattern
formation are not understood. New experimental investigations reported here
show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the
inoculation site and in the process form many complex patterns, including
radial and spiral streams, in addition to concentric rings. These new
observations suggest that swimmers are motile and that indirect interactions
between them are essential in the pattern formation. To explain these
observations we develop a hybrid cell-based model that incorporates a
chemotactic response of swimmers to a chemical they produce. The model predicts
that formation of radial streams can be explained as the modulation of the
local attractant concentration by the cells, and that the chirality of the
spiral streams can be predicted by incorporating a swimming bias of the cells
near the surface of the substrate. The spatial patterns generated from the
model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

the directions to those of known star formation regions, masers, radio, and
infrared sources. The disk area covered by VVV was visually inspected using the
pipeline processed and calibrated $K_{\rm S}$-band tile images for stellar
overdensities. Subsequently, we examined the composite $JHK_{\rm S}$ and
$ZJK_{\rm S}$ color images of each candidate. PSF photometry of $15\times15$
arcmin fields centered on the candidates was then performed on the Cambridge
Astronomy Survey Unit reduced images. After statistical field-star
decontamination, color-magnitude and color-color diagrams were constructed and
analyzed. We report the discovery of 96 new infrared open clusters and stellar
groups. Most of the new cluster candidates are faint and compact (with small
angular sizes), highly reddened, and younger than 5\,Myr. For relatively well
populated cluster candidates we derived their fundamental parameters such as

separability and entanglement, however, for mixed states a minimal amount of
mixedness is needed. We discuss our general statements in detail for the
familiar case of qubits, the GHZ states, Werner states and Gisin states,
emphasizing their geometric features. As theorists we use and play with this
free choice of factorization, which is naturally fixed for an experimentalist.

report the lack of anisotropies in these directions at energies above
$E_{th}/Z$ (for illustrative values of $Z=6,\ 13,\ 26$). If the anisotropies

processing. Given the wide variety of linear optical devices available, a
diverse range of operations can be performed on the spatial degrees of freedom
of single photons. Here we show how to implement a set of continuous quantum
logic gates which allow for universal quantum computation. In contrast with the
usual quadratures of the electromagnetic field, the entire set of single photon
gates for spatial degrees of freedom does not require optical nonlinearity and,
in principle, can be performed with a single device: the spatial light
modulator. Nevertheless, nonlinear optical processes, such as four-wave mixing,
are needed in the implementation of two-photon gates. The efficiency of these
gates is at present very low, however small scale investigations of continuous
variable quantum computation are within the reach of current technology. In
this regard, we show how novel cluster states for one-way quantum computing can
be produced using spontaneous parametric down conversion.

to variations in the refracted unscattered sunlight absorbed by the terrestrial
atmosphere that occur as the satellite crosses the Earth's shadow. The
contribution to the Moon's aspect from sunlight scattered at the Earth's
terminator is generally deemed minor. However, our analysis of a published
spectrum of the 16 August 2008 lunar eclipse shows that diffuse sunlight is a
major component of the measured spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm.
The conclusion is supported by two distinct features, namely the spectrum's
tail at short wavelengths and the unequal absorption by an oxygen collisional
complex at two nearby bands. Our findings are consistent with the presence of
the volcanic cloud reported at high northern latitudes following the 7-8 August
2008 eruption in Alaska of the Kasatochi volcano. The cloud both attenuates the
unscattered sunlight and enhances moderately the scattered component, thus
modifying the contrast between the two contributions.

endothelium (TEPD) is related electro-osmotically to fluid transport. Hence,
determination of the TEPD would serve as a measure of the fluid movement. The
oscillatory nature of the TEPD has been recognized recently using the Fourier
transform; the oscillations of the highest amplitude were linked to the
operation of electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporters. However, no time
localization of that activity could be obtained with the Fourier methodology
utilized. For that reason we now characterize the TEPD using wavelet analysis
for the first time in the epithelial physiology field, with the aim to localize
in time the variations in TEPD. We find that the high-amplitude oscillations of
the TEPD are cyclic, with a period of 4.6 \pm 0.4 s in the average (n=4). The
wavelet power value at the peak of such oscillations is 1.5 \pm 0.1 mV2 Hz in

however a hard particle injection that does not fit the observed ultrahigh

fraction of GORES as a function of class only or class and distance to the
cluster centre (as in our deprojected fraction). In our best-fitting model
GORES account for 13% of galaxies within the virial sphere, 11% of the virial
population, 34% of the distant (for projected radii R<2 R_v) infall population
and 19% of the backsplash galaxies. Given the 1-3 Gyr lookback time of our
GORES indicators, these results suggest that SF in a galaxy is almost
completely quenched in a single passage through the cluster.

companions, as observed in different multiplicity surveys, to the most recent
estimate of the single object mass function (Bochanski et al. 2010). The main
goal of our analysis is to test whether or not the observed companion mass
ratio distribution (CMRD) as a function of primary star mass and star formation
environment is consistent with having been drawn from the field star IMF. We
consider samples of companions for M dwarfs, solar type and intermediate mass
stars, both in the field as well as clusters or associations, and compare them
with populations of binaries generated by random pairing from the assumed IMF
for a fixed primary mass. With regard to the field we can reject the hypothesis
that the CMRD was drawn from the IMF for different primary mass ranges: the
observed CMRDs show a larger number of equal-mass systems than predicted by the
IMF. This is in agreement with fragmentation theories of binary formation. For
the open clusters {\alpha} Persei and the Pleiades we also reject the IMF
random- pairing hypothesis. Concerning young star-forming regions, currently we
can rule out a connection between the CMRD and the field IMF in Taurus but not
in Chamaeleon I. Larger and different samples are needed to better constrain
the result as a function of the environment. We also consider other companion
mass functions (CMF) and we compare them with observations. Moreover the CMRD
both in the field and clusters or associations appears to be independent of
separation in the range covered by the observations. Combining therefore the
CMRDs of M and G primaries in the field and intermediate mass primary binaries
in Sco OB2 for mass ratios, q = M2/M1, from 0.2 to 1, we find that the best
chi-square fit follows a power law dN/dq \propto q^{\beta}, with {\beta} =
-0.50 \pm 0.29, consistent with previous results.

correlate with i/D at greater than 3.2 sigma significance. Overall, this result
suggests that MgII gas has a co-planer geometry, not necessarily disk-like,
that is coupled to the galaxy inclination. It is plausible that the absorbing
gas arises from tidal streams, satellites, filaments, etc., which tend to have
somewhat co-planer distributions. This result does not support a picture in
which MgII absorbers with Wr(2796)<1A are predominantly produced by
star-formation driven winds. We further find that; (1) MgII host galaxies have
quantitatively similar bulge and disk scale length distribution to field
galaxies at similar redshifts and have a mean disk and bulge scale length of
3.8kpc and 2.5kpc, respectively; (2) Galaxy color and luminosity do not

very massive SMBH. Our analysis suggests that we are resolving, for the first
time, the accretion flow within the Bondi radius of an SMBH. We show that the
temperature is rising toward the galaxy center as expected in all accretion
models in which the black hole is gravitationally capturing the ambient gas.
There is no hard central point source that could cause such an apparent rise in
temperature. The data support that the Bondi radius is at about 4 arcsec-5
arcsec (188-235 pc), suggesting an SMBH of 2 x 10^9 M_sun that is consistent
with the upper end of the optical results. The density profile within the Bondi
radius has a power-law index of 1.03^{+0.23}_{-0.21} which is consistent with
gas in transition from the ambient medium and the accretion flow. The accretion
rate at the Bondi radius is determined to be {\dot M}_B = 2.2 x 10^{-2} M_sun

where the background peaks. Combining PACS observations of the GOODS-S,

more than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mJy to few hundreds mJy.
Stacking of 24 micron sources and P(D) statistics extend the analysis down to
~0.2 mJy. Taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in PEP fields,
differential number counts and CIB are studied up to z=5. Based on these
counts, we discuss the effects of confusion on PACS blank field observations
and provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. The total CIB
surface brightness emitted above PEP 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35

that some of the SCSNe host galaxies are relatively metal-poor, we focus
quantitatively on their locations in the hosts to point out that in three out
of four cases, the SCSNe explosions occurred in the outer edge of the disks of
their hosts. It is therefore very likely that their progenitors had far lower
metallicities than those implied by the metallicity of their hosts' central
regions. In two cases (SN 2003fg and SN 2009dc) the explosion sites were
outside 99% of the host's light, and in one case (SN 2006gz) the host's radial
metallicity slope indicates that the explosion site is in a metal-poor region.
The fourth case (SN 2007if) has the lowest spectroscopically measured SN Ia
host metallicity (Childress et al. 2011. It may be possible to explain each of
these unusually bright events through some progenitor scenario specific to that

poor environments.

of the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of SN2009nz and uncover broad
features typical of nearby GRB-SNe. This establishes unambiguously that
GRB091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined Type Ic SN, and links a cosmological
long burst with a standard energy release (E_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to a
massive star progenitor. The spectrum of SN2009nz closely resembles that of
SN2006aj, with SN2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but has
significantly narrower features than SNe 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of a
lower expansion velocity. The photospheric velocity inferred from the SiII 6355
absorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of SNe 2006aj
and 2003dh than to the other GRB-SNe. Combining the measured velocity with the
light curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosion
parameters: M_Ni ~ 0.35 M_sun, E_K ~ 2.3e51 erg, and M_ej ~ 1.4 M_sun, similar
to those of SN2006aj. These properties indicate that SN2009nz follows a trend
of lower M_Ni for GRB-SNe with lower E_K and M_ej. Equally important, since
GRB091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of SN2009nz to
SN2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that XRF060218/SN2006aj was powered by
a neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encoded
in the SN properties but not in the prompt emission. Future spectra of GRB-SNe
at z > 0.3, including proper subtraction of the host galaxy contribution, will
shed light on the full dispersion of SN properties for standard long GRBs, on
the relation between SNe associated with sub-energetic and standard GRBs, and

not only lifts the stringent constraint of one-dimensionality, but also allows
having higher carrier density in the nanowire. Consequently, multiband
nanowires are better-suited for stabilizing the topological superconducting
phase and for observing the Majorana physics. We present a detailed study of
the parameter space for multiband semiconductor nanowires focusing on
understanding the key experimental conditions required for the realization and
detection of Majorana fermions in solid-state systems. We include various
sources of disorder and characterize their effects on the stability of the
topological phase. Finally, we calculate the local density of states as well as
the differential tunneling conductance as functions of external parameters and
predict the experimental signatures that would establish the existence of
emergent Majorana zero-energy modes in solid-state systems.

the amount of black hole growth in z=6-8 galaxies (0.7-1 billion years after
the Big Bang). Our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with their
hosts throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. We find that
most copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significant
amounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highest
energy X-rays. This suggests that black holes grow significantly more than
previously thought during these early bursts, and due to obscuration they do
not contribute to the re-ionization of the Universe with their ultraviolet

general properties of a blast wave shock interacting with interstellar clouds.
The shock-cloud interaction generates a turbulent shell through the vorticity
generations. In the turbulent shell, the magnetic field is amplified as a
result of turbulent dynamo action. In the case of a young supernova remnant,
the corresponding strength of the magnetic field is approximately 1 mG. The
propagation speed of the shock wave is significantly stalled in the clouds
because of the high density, while the shock maintains a high velocity in the
diffuse surrounding. In addition, when the shock wave hits the clouds,
reflection shock waves are generated that propagate back into the shocked
shell. From these simulation results, many observational characteristics of a
young SNR RX J1713.7-3946 that is suggested to be interacting with molecular
clouds, can be explained as follows: The reflection shocks can accelerate
particles in the turbulent downstream region where the magnetic field strength
reaches 1mG, which causes short-time variability of synchrotron X-rays. Since
the shock velocity is stalled locally in the clouds, the temperature in the
shocked cloud is suppressed below 1 keV. Thus, thermal X-ray line emissions
would be faint even if the SNR is interacting with molecular clouds. We also
find that the photon index of the $\pi^0$-decay gamma rays generated by
cosmic-ray protons can be 1.5, because the penetration depth of high-energy
particles into the clumpy clouds depends on their energy, which is consistent
with the recent gamma-ray observation by Fermi space telescope.

While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating

such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore, it is, in general,
expected that quantum gravity only respects local gauge, or discreet,
symmetries. String theory provides the arena to study particle physics in a
consistent framework of perturbative quantum gravity. An appealing proposition,
in this context, is that the dangerous operators are suppressed by an Abelian
gauge symmetry, which is broken near the TeV scale. A viable U(1) symmetry
should also be anomaly free, be family universal, and allow the generation of
fermion masses via the Higgs mechanism. We discuss such U(1) symmetries that
arise in quasi--realistic free fermionic heterotic--string derived models.
Ensuring that the U(1) symmetry is anomaly free at the low scale requires that
the Standard Model spectrum is augmented by additional states that are

However, inside
GMCs, most of the gas does not participate in star formation; rather, denser
gas accumulates in clumps in the GMC, with the bulk of the stars in a given GMC
forming in a few of the most massive clumps. In the Milky Way, these clumps
have masses $M_{\rm cl}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$ of the GMC, radii $r_{\rm cl}
\sim 1$pc, and free-fall times $\tau_{\rm cl} \sim 2\times 10^5\yr$. We show
that clumps inside giant molecular clouds should accrete at a modified Bondi
accretion rate, which depends on clump mass as $\dot M_{\rm cl}\sim M_{\rm
cl}^{5/4}$. This rate is initially rather slow, usually slower than the initial
star formation rate inside the clump (we adopt the common assumption that
inside the clump, $\dot M_*=\epsilon_{\rm ff} M_{\rm cl}/\tau_{\rm cl}$, with
$\epsilon_{\rm ff} \approx 0.017$). However, after $\sim 2$ GMC free-fall times
$\tau_{\rm GMC}$, the clump accretion rate accelerates rapidly; formally, the
clump can accrete the entire GMC in $\sim 3\tau_{\rm GMC}$. At the same time,
the star formation rate accelerates, tracking the Bondi accretion rate. If the
GMC is disrupted by feedback from the largest clump, half the stars in that
clump form in the final $\taug$ before the GMC is disrupted. The theory
predicts that the distribution of effective star formation rates, measured per
GMC free-fall time, is broad, ranging from $\sim 0.001$ up to 0.1 or larger and

large top-charm or top-up couplings. Large top-up couplings in particular would
lead to a top forward-backward asymmetry through $t$-channel exchange, easily
consistent with the Tevatron measurements. Intriguingly, there is destructive
interference between the top-mesons and the standard model which conspire to
make the overall top pair production rate consistent with the standard model.
The rate for same-sign top production is also small due to destructive
interference between the neutral top-pion and the top-Higgs. Flavor physics is
under control because new physics is mostly confined to the top quark. In this
way, top condensation can explain the asymmetry and be consistent with all

large tu mixing, such as top(s)+jet(s) events, in which a top and a jet

the average analytic rank of a family of quadratic twists of a fixed elliptic
curve in the function field setting. In particular, we consider representatives
of the four classes of non-isogenous elliptic curves over F_q(t) with (q,6)=1
possessing two places of multiplicative reduction and one place of additive
reduction. The case of q=5 provides the largest data set as well as the most
convincing evidence that the average analytic rank converges to 1/2, which we
also show is a lower bound following an argument of Kowalski. The data was
generated via explicit computation of the L-function of these elliptic curves,
and we present the key results necessary to implement an algorithm to
efficiently compute the L-function of non-isotrivial elliptic curves over
F_q(t) by realizing such a curve as a quadratic twist of a pullback of a
`versal' elliptic curve. We also provide a reference for our open-source
library ELLFF, which provides all the necessary functionality to compute such
L-functions, and additional data on analytic rank distributions as they pertain
to the density conjecture.

{\it linear} Fokker-Planck (FP) equation with {\it inhomogenous} diffusion
coefficient, and the non-Markovian process leading to the {\it nonlinear} FP
equation with {\it homogeneous} diffusion coefficient. More precisely, we
consider the equation $\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial
t}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[F(x) p(x,t)] + 1/2D \frac{\partial^2}{\partial
x^2} [\phi(x,p)p(x,t)]$, where $D \in {\cal R}$ and $F(x)=-\partial V(x)
/\partial x$, $V(x)$ being the potential under which diffusion occurs. Our aim
is to find whether $\phi(x,p)$ exists such that the inhomogeneous linear and
the homogeneous nonlinear FP equations become unified in such a way that the
(ubiquitously observed) $q$-exponentials remain as stationary solutions. It
turns out that such solutions indeed exist for a wide class of systems, namely
when $\phi(x,p)=[A+BV(x)]^\theta [p(x,t)]^{\eta}$, where $A$, $B$, $\theta$ and
$\eta$ are (real) constants.
  Our main result can be sumarized as follows: For $\theta \neq 1$ and
arbitrary confining potential $V(x)$, $p(x,\infty) \propto \lbrace
1-\beta(1-q)V(x)\rbrace ^{1/(1-q)} \equiv e_q^{-\beta V(x)}$, where $q= 1+
\eta/(\theta-1)$. The present approach unifies into a single mechanism,
essentially {\it long memory}, results currently discussed and applied in the

how contingent allocation of prizes based on relative levels of support affects

voters influence the distribution of prizes across groups. Such prize
pivotality supports positive voter turnout even in non-competitive electoral

apply these to the real data and find that for the population as a whole the

However, it is often tacitly assumed that metallicity has no effect on the rate
of SNe Ia. We propose that a consequence of the effects of metallicity is to
significantly increase the SN Ia rate in lower-metallicity galaxies, in
contrast to previous expectations. This is because lower-metallicity stars
leave behind higher-mass white dwarfs, which should be easier to bring to
explosion. We first model SN Ia rates in relation to galaxy masses and ages
alone, finding that the elevation in the rate of SNe Ia in lower-mass galaxies
measured by LOSS is readily explained. However, we then see that models
incorporating this effect of metallicity agree just as well. Using the same
parameters to estimate the cosmic SN Ia rate, we again find good agreement with
data up to z~2. We suggest that this degeneracy warrants more detailed
examination of host galaxy metallicities. We discuss additional implications,
including for hosts of high-z SNe Ia, the SN Ia delay time distribution,
super-Chandrasekhar SNe, and cosmology.

cylindrical shell of counter rotating particles. In some sense these are the
simplest systems with a physically acceptable matter content that display in a
well defined sense an interaction with the radiative modes of the gravitational
field. These systems have been analyzed previously, but in most cases resorting
to approximations, or considering a particular form for the initial value data.
Here we show that there exists a family of solutions where the space time
inside the shell is flat and the equation of motion of the shell decouples
completely from the gravitational modes. The motion of the shell is governed by
an equation of the same form as that of a particle in a time independent one
dimensional potential. We find that under appropriate initial conditions one
can have collapsing, bounded periodic, and unbounded motions. We analyze and
solve also the linearized equations that describe the dynamics of the system
near a stable static solutions, keeping a regular interior. The surprising
result here is that the motion of the shell is completely determined by the
configuration of the radiative modes of the gravitational field. In particular,
there are oscillating solutions for any chosen period, in contrast with the
""approximately Newtonian plus small radiative corrections"" motion expectation.
We comment on the physical meaning of these results and provide some explicit
examples. We also discuss the relation of our results to the initial value
problem for the linearized dynamics of the shell.

polarization is limited to the vicinity of a ferromagnetic source electrode. In
this paper, we propose the use of dilute magnetic semiconductors to improve the
coherence of spatially oscillating electron-spin polarization. In dilute
magnetic semiconductors, the electron-spin polarization near the source
electrode dynamically induces the local spin polarization of magnetic
impurities through s-d spin-flip scattering. This impurity-spin polarization
improves, in turn, the coherence of the electron-spin polarization, and this
improved electron-spin polarization induces impurity-spin polarization farther
in the adjacent region. Because of this positive feedback, the coherent and
synchronized spatial oscillations of electron- and impurity-spin polarizations
grow cooperatively. A numerical calculation for a CdMnTe quantum well
demonstrates the validity of this mechanism.

complex functionalities through parallelism of simple and rudimentary
components. The key issue in cooperative control of multi-agent systems is the
synthesis of local control and interaction rules among the agents such that the
entire controlled system achieves a desired global behavior. For this purpose,
three fundamental problems have to be addressed: (1) task decomposition for
top-down design, such that the fulfillment of local tasks guarantees the
satisfaction of the global task, by the team; (2) fault-tolerant top-down
design, such that the global task remains decomposable and achievable, in spite
of some failures, and (3) design of interactions among agents to make an
undecomposable task decomposable and achievable in a top-down framework. The
first two problems have been addressed in our previous works, by identifying
necessary and sufficient conditions for task automaton decomposition, and
fault-tolerant task decomposability. This paper deals with the third problem
and proposes a procedure to redistribute the events among agents in order to
enforce decomposability of an undecomposable task automaton. The
decomposability conditions are used to identify the root causes of
undecomposability which are found to be due to over-communications that have to
be deleted, while respecting the fault-tolerant decomposability conditions; or
because of the lack of communications that require new sharing of events, while
considering new violations of decomposability conditions. This result provides
a sufficient condition to make any undecomposable deterministic task automaton
decomposable in order to facilitate cooperative tasking. Illustrative examples
are presented to show the concept of task automaton decomposabilization.

compact complex algebraic manifold in terms of cohomological Gromov-Witten

the Kawasaki-Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for expressing holomorphic Euler
characteristics of orbibundles on moduli spaces of genus-0 stable maps,
analyzing the sophisticated combinatorial structure of inertia stacks of such
moduli spaces, and employing various quantum Riemann--Roch formulas from ""fake""

either previously known from works of Coates-Givental, Tseng, and
Coates-Corti-Iritani-Tseng, or newly developed for this purpose in separate
papers by Tonita). The ultimate formulation combines properties of overruled
Lagrangian cones in symplectic loop spaces (the language, that has become
traditional in description of generating functions of genus-0 Gromov-Witten
theory) with a novel framework of ""adelic characterization"" of such cones. As
an application, we prove that tangent spaces of the overruled Lagrangian cones
of quantum K-theory carry a natural structure of modules over the algebra of
finite-difference operators in Novikov's variables. As another application, we
compute one of such tangent spaces for each of the complete intersections given

(with R_0= 7.5 kpc, or at 9.5 kpc if R_0 = 8.5 kpc is adopted) is well
explained by the corotation ring-shaped gap in the density of gas, which
isolates the internal and external regions of the disk one from the other. This
solves a long standing problem of understanding the different chemical
characteristics of the inner and outer parts of the disk. The time required to
build up the metallicity difference between the two sides of the step is a
measure of the minimal life-time of the present grand-design spiral pattern
structure, of the order of 3 Gyr. The plateaux observed on each side of the
step are interpreted in terms of the large scale radial motion of the stars and
of the gas flow induced by the spiral structure. The star-formation rate
revealed by the density of open clusters is maximum in the Galactic radial
range from 6 to 12 kpc (with an exception of a narrow gap at corotation),
coinciding with the region where the 4-arms mode is allowed to exist. We argue
that most of the old open clusters situated at large galactocentric radii were
born in this inner region where conditions more favorable to star-formation are
found. The ratio of $\alpha$-elements to Fe of the sample of Cepheids does not
vary appreciably with the Galactic radius, which reveals an homogeneous history
of star formation. Different arguments are given showing that usual
approximations of chemical evolution models, which assume fast mixing of
metallicity in the azimuthal direction and ignore the existence of the spiral
arms, are a poor ones.

parameter in a (2+1)-dimensional field theory at zero-temperature and finite
density, dual to the electron star background of Hartnoll and Tavanfar. An
appealing feature of this field theory is the emergence of an IR Lifshitz
fixed-point with a finite dynamical critical exponent $z$, which is due to the
strong interaction between critical bosonic degrees of freedom and a finite
density of fermions (metallic quantum criticality). We show that under some
circumstances the electron star background develops a neutral scalar hair whose
holographic interpretation is that the boundary field theory undergoes a
quantum phase transition, with a Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless character, to a
phase with a neutral order parameter. Including the backreaction of the bulk
neutral scalar on the background, we argue that the two phases across the
quantum critical point have different $z$, a novelty that exists in certain
quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. We also analyze the
system at finite temperature and find that the phase transition becomes, as
expected, second-order. Embedding the neutral scalar into a higher form, a
variety of interesting phases could potentially be realized for the boundary
field theory. Examples which are of particular interest to condensed matter
physics include an antiferromagnetic phase where a vector condenses and break
the spin symmetry, a quadrupole nematic phase which involves the condensation
of a symmetric traceless tensor breaking rotational symmetry, or different
phases of a system with competing order parameters.

razor thin particle layer occurs when the Toomre parameter $Q_T \equiv c_p
\Omega_0 / \pi G \Sigma_p < 1$ ($c_p$ being the particle dispersion velocity).
Ward(1976,2000) extended this analysis by adding the effect of gas drag upon
particles and found that even when $Q_T > 1$, sufficiently long waves were
always unstable. Youdin (2005a,b) carried out a detailed analysis and showed
that the instability allows chondrule-sized ($\sim 1 $ mm) particles to undergo
radial clumping with reasonable growth times even in the presence of a moderate
amount of turbulent stirring. The analysis of Youdin includes the role of
turbulence in setting the thickness of the dust layer and in creating a
turbulent particle pressure in the momentum equation. However, he ignores the
effect of turbulent mass diffusivity on the disturbance wave. Here we show that
including this effect reduces the growth-rate significantly, by an amount that
depends on the level of turbulence, and reduces the maximum intensity of
turbulence the instability can withstand by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. The
instability is viable only when turbulence is extremely weak and the solid to
gas surface density of the particle layer is considerably enhanced over
minimum-mass-nebula values. A simple mechanistic explanation of the instability
shows how the azimuthal component of drag promotes instability while the radial
component hinders it. A gravito-diffusive overstability is also possible but
never realized in the nebula models.

2200 +/- 130 km/s. Similar waves propagating in opposite directions are
observed in closed loops between two flare ribbons. In the k-$\omega$ diagram
of the Fourier wave power, we find a bright ridge that represents the

determined to reproduce the components of the nucleon self-energy at the Fermi

the various mean field models can reproduce the DBHF results for the momentum

the contribution of various parameters to the running time of algorithms and

to develop a theory of computational complexity which seeks to exploit this

This theory has a large number of successes in terms of a rich collection of

intractability theory. Whilst the theory has been widely used in a number of
areas of applications including computational biology, linguistics, VLSI

X-ray computed tomography (\mu CT) recordings have been used as geometric input
data for FEM models of the ME ossicles. Previously, attempts were made to
obtain this data on ME soft tissue structures as well. However, due to low
X-ray absorption of soft tissue, quality of these images is limited. Another
popular approach is using histological sections as data for 3D models,
delivering high in-plane resolution for the sections, but the technique is
destructive in nature and registration of the sections is difficult. We combine
data from high-resolution \mu CT recordings with data from high-resolution
orthogonal-plane fluorescence optical-sectioning microscopy (OPFOS), both
obtained on the same gerbil specimen. State-of-the-art \mu CT delivers
high-resolution data on the three-dimensional shape of ossicles and other ME
bony structures, while the OPFOS setup generates data of unprecedented quality
both on bone and soft tissue ME structures. Each of these techniques is
tomographic and non-destructive, and delivers sets of automatically aligned
virtual sections. The datasets coming from different techniques need to be
registered with respect to each other. By combining both datasets, we obtain a
complete high-resolution morphological model of all functional components in
the gerbil ME. The resulting three-dimensional model can be readily imported in
FEM software and is made freely available to the research community. In this

great interest for neuromorphic computing, nonlinear electronics and computer
memory. It is usually modelled either using Chua's equations, which lack
material device properties, or using Strukov's phenomenological model (or
models derived from it), which deviates from Chua's definitions due to the lack
of a magnetic flux term. It is shown that by modelling the magnetostatics of
the memory-holding ionic current (oxygen vacancies in the Strukov memristor),
the memristor's magnetic flux can be identified as the flux arising from the
ions. This leads to a novel theory of memristance consisting of two components:
1. A memory function which describes how the memristance, as felt by the ions,
affects the conducting electrons located in the `on' part of the device; 2. A
conservation function which describes the time-varying resistance in the `off'
part of the device. This model allows for a straight-forward incorporation of
the ions within the electronic theory and relates Chua's constitutive
definition of a memristor with device material properties for the first time.

clearly separate different sub-populations. We instead propose a classification
using a combination of Fe and Ba (much more abundant in the more metal-rich
group) through a cluster analysis: we separated stars into a metal-rich (MR)
and a metal-poor (MP) populations, each of them showing a Na-O anticorrelation,
signature of genuine GC, although with different ratios of primordial to
polluted stars. The ratio [alpha/H] tracks iron and is higher in the MR
population, suggesting an additional contribution by core-collapse supernovae.
The MR population shows a larger enrichment in s-process elements compared to
the MP one. This is probably due to the contribution by intermediate-low mass
stars, because we find that the level of heavy s-process elements is larger
than the level of light s-process nuclei in the MR stars; however, a large
contribution by low mass stars is unlikely, because it would likely cancel the
O-Na anticorrelation. We also confirm the presence of correlations between
p-capture and s-process elements previously found by other studies, at least
for the MR population. This finding apparently requires a quite long delay for
the second generation of the MR component. A merger of two distinct GCs in a
parent dwarf galaxy, each one with a different Ba level and an age difference
of ~1 Gyr, might explain (i) the double SGB, (ii) a possible difference in C
content between the two original GCs, and (iii) the Stromgren photometry of

aspects during the design stage. Most of DFM approaches usually consider only
one manufacturing process, but products competitiveness may be improved by
designing hybrid modular products, in which products are seen as 3-D puzzles
with modules realized aside by the best manufacturing process and further
gathered. A new DFM system is created in order to give quantitative information
during the product design stage of which modules will benefit in being machined
and which ones will advantageously be realized by an additive process (such as
Selective Laser Sintering or laser deposition). A methodology for a
manufacturability evaluation in case of a subtractive or an additive
manufacturing process is developed and implemented in a CAD software. Tests are
carried out on industrial products from automotive industry.

The modeling approach we describe incorporates Gaussian processes in a
generalized linear model framework to obtain a class of nonparametric
regression models where the covariance matrix depends on the predictors. We
consider, in particular, continuous, categorical and count responses. We also
look into models that account for survival outcomes. We explore alternative
covariance formulations for the Gaussian process prior and demonstrate the
flexibility of the construction. Next, we focus on the important problem of
selecting variables from the set of possible predictors and describe a general
framework that employs mixture priors. We compare alternative MCMC strategies
for posterior inference and achieve a computationally efficient and practical
approach. We demonstrate performances on simulated and benchmark data sets.

on the sky. In the spectrum of Q0151+048A (qA), a DLA is observed at a higher
redshift. We have previously detected the host galaxies of both QSOs, as well
as a Lya blob. We performed low-resolution spectroscopy with the slit aligned
with the extended emission. We also observed the system using the
medium-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectrograph and the slit aligned with the two
QSOs. We measure systemic redshifts of zem(A)=1.92924{\pm}0.00036 and
zem(B)=1.92863{\pm}0.00042 from the H{\beta} and H{\alpha} emission lines,
respectively. We estimate the masses of the black holes of the two QSOs to be
10^9.33 M{\odot} and 10^8.38 M{\odot} for qA and qB, respectively. From this we
infered the mass of the dark matter halos hosting the two QSOs: 10^13.74
M{\odot} and 10^13.13 M{\odot} for qA and qB, respectively. We observe a
velocity gradient along the major axis of the Lya blob consistent with the
rotation curve of a large disk galaxy, but it may also be caused by gas inflow
or outflow. We detect residual continuum in the DLA trough which we interpret
as emission from the host galaxy of qA. The derived H0 column density of the
DLA is log NH0 = 20.34 {\pm} 0.02. Metal column densities results in an overall
metallicity of 0.01 Z{\odot}. We detect CII* which allows us to make a physical
model of the DLA cloud. From the systemic redshifts of the QSOs, we conclude
that the Lya blob is associated with qA rather than with the DLA. The DLA must
be located in front of both the Lya blob and qA at a distance larger than 30
kpc. The two QSOs accrete at normal eddington ratios. The DM halo of this
double quasar will grow to the mass of our local super-cluster at z=0. We point
out that those objects therefore form an ideal laboratory to study the physical
interactions in a z=2 pre-cursor of our local super-cluster.

the Mn spin dynamics under the influence of a pumping laser that injects
excitons into the dot, taking into account exciton-Mn exchange and phonon
induced spin relaxation of both Mn and holes. Our simulations account for the

depending on their specific star formation rate. We have computed the galaxy
stellar mass function of the total sample and the different populations at

finding that they are old (1-4 Gyr), massive (log(M/M_sun)~10.65), weakly star
forming stellar populations with low dust extinction (E(B-V) < 0.15) and small
e-folding time scales (tau ~ 0.1-0.3 Gyr). We observe a significant evolution
of the quiescent stellar mass function from 2.5 < z < 3.0 to 1.4 < z < 1.6,
increasing by ~ 1 dex in this redshift interval. We find that z ~ 1.5 is an

derived with that predicted by theoretical models and find that the Kitzbichler

bispectrum. Previous work on correcting the biases and estimating the variances
for these quantities typically includes restrictive assumptions about the
sampling of the interferogram and/or about the relative importance of Poisson
and Gaussian noise sources. Until now it has been difficult to accurately
compensate for systematic biases in data which violates these assumptions. We
seek a formalism to allow the construction of bias-free estimators of the
bispectrum and power spectrum, and to estimate their variances, under less
restrictive conditions which include both unevenly-sampled data and
measurements affected by a combination of noise sources with Poisson and
Gaussian statistics. We used a method based on the moments of the noise
distributions to derive formulae for the biases introduced to the power
spectrum and bispectrum when the complex fringe amplitude is derived from an
arbitrary linear combinations of a set of discrete interferogram measurements.
We simulated interferograms with different combinations of photon noise and
read noise and with different fringe encoding schemes to illustrate the effects
of these biases. We have derived formulae for bias-free estimators of the power
spectrum and bispectrum which can be used with any linear estimator of the
fringe complex amplitude. We have demonstrated the importance of bias-free
estimators for the case of the detection of faint companions (for example
exoplanets) using closure phase nulling. We have derived formulae for the
variance of the power spectrum and have shown how the variance of the
bispectrum could be calculated.

This source was target of multi-epoch VLBI and Space-VLBI observations at 4.8,
8.4 and 22 GHz carried out between 1999 and 2001. The comparison of the
parsec-scale structure observed at different epochs shows the presence of a
non-stationary jet feature moving with a superluminal apparent velocity of
16.2c+-0.7c. Over three epochs at 8.4 GHz during this period the core flux
density varies of about 50%, while the scatter in the jet flux density is
within 10%. The polarization percentage of both core and jet components
significantly change from 2 to 9 per cent, while the polarization angle of the
core shows an abrupt change of about 90 degrees becoming roughly perpendicular
to the jet direction, consistent with a change in the opacity. To complete the
picture of the physical processes at work, we complemented our observations
with multi-epoch VLBA data at 15 GHz from the MOJAVE programme spanning a time
baseline from 1995 to 2010. Since 1995 jet components are ejected roughly once
per year with the same position angle and an apparent speed between 15c and
20c, indicating that no jet precession is taking place on a timescale longer
than a decade in our frame. The variability of the total intensity flux density
together with variations in the polarization properties may be explained
assuming either a change between the optically-thick and -thin regimes produced
by a shock that varies the opacity, or a highly ordered magnetic field produced
by the compression of the relativistic plasma by a shock propagating along the
jet. Taking into account the high gamma-ray emission observed from this source
by the AGILE and Fermi satellites we investigated the connection between the
radio and gamma-ray activity during 2007-2010.

about 0.2 A and the spectral resolution is about 26000. About 300 line profiles
were obtained within a radial range of 1.0-1.5 R\odot and position angle
coverage of about 240\circ. The line profiles were fitted with single Gaussian
and their intensity, Doppler velocity, and line width have been obtained. Also
obtained are the centroids of the line profiles which give a measure of line
asymmetry. The histograms of Doppler velocity show excess blueshifts while the
centroids reveal a pre-dominant blue wing in the line profiles. It has been
found that the centroids and the Doppler velocities are highly correlated. This
points to the presence of multiple components in the line profiles with an
excess of blueshifted components. We have then obtained the(Blue-Red) wing
intensity which clearly reveals the second component, majority of which are
blueshifted ones. This confirms that the coronal green line profiles often
contain multicomponents with excess blueshifts which also depend on the solar
activity. The magnitude of the Doppler velocity of the secondary component is
in the range 20-40 km s-1 and they show an increase towards poles. The possible
explanations of the multicomponents could be the type II spicules which were
recently found to have important to the coronal heating or the nascent solar
wind flow, but the cause of the blue asymmetry in the coronal lines above the
limb remains unclear.

bound to, such as nuclear mass, charge distribution, spin, magnetization
distribution, or even excited level scheme. These nuclear parameters are
reflected in the atomic transition energies. A very precise determination of
atomic spectra may thus reveal information about the nucleus, otherwise hardly
accessible via nuclear physics experiments. This work reviews theoretical and
experimental aspects of the nuclear effects that can be identified in atomic
structure data. An introduction to the theory of isotope shifts and hyperfine
splitting of atomic spectra is given, together with an overview of the typical
experimental techniques used in high-precision atomic spectroscopy. More exotic
effects at the borderline between atomic and nuclear physics, such as parity
violation in atomic transitions due to the weak interaction, or nuclear
polarization and nuclear excitation by electron capture, are also addressed.

the dynamics underlying each of the models, supersymmetric and

discern non-supersymmetric Higgs bosons from supersymmetric ones. Furthermore,

theory is based on a direct analysis of fields in the lattice cells rather than
on an indirect retrieval of material parameters from transmission / reflection
data. The theory is minimalistic, with only two fundamental premises at its
core: (i) the coarse-grained fields satisfy Maxwell's equations and boundary
conditions exactly; and (ii) the material tensor is a linear relationship
between the pairs of coarse-grained fields. There are no heuristic assumptions
and no artificial averaging rules. Nontrivial magnetic behavior, if present, is
a logical consequence of the theory. The method yields not only all 36 standard
material parameters, but also additional ones quantifying spatial dispersion
rigorously. The approximations involved are clearly identified. A tutorial
example and an application to a resonant structure with high-permittivity
inclusions are given.

frustrated Ising model with nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic coupling $J_1$
and next nearest neighbour coupling $J_2$. The model is inspired on the physics
of pnictide superconductors and to some extent we argue that it can be more
representative of this physics than the Heisenberg counterpart. Parameters are
chosen such that the ground state is a columnar or striped state, as observed
experimentally, but is close to the transition to the simple Neel ordered
antiferromagnetic state $R = J_2/|J_1|\gtrsim 0.5$. We find that a nematic
phase is induced close to $R = 0.5$ by finite size effects and argue that this
explains experiments in imperfect samples which find a more robust nematic
state as the quality of the sample decreases [A. Jesche et al., Phys. Rev. B
81, 134525 (2010)]. Including the effect of a weak coupling with the lattice we
find that a structural transition occurs associated with a nematic phase, with
a magnetic transition occurring at a lower temperature. These two transitions
merge into a single structural and magnetic transition with a stronger
first-order character for larger spin-lattice couplings. These two situations
are in agreement with the different phenomenologies found in different families
of pnictides.

heavily debated in recent times. Amongst the various definitions of network
neutrality, we focus on the one which prohibits paid prioritization of content
and we present an analytical treatment of the topic. We develop a model of the
Internet ecosystem in terms of three primary players: consumers, ISPs and
content providers. Our analysis looks at this issue from the point of view of
the consumer, and we describe the desired state of the system as one which
maximizes consumer surplus. By analyzing different scenarios of monopoly and
competition, we obtain different conclusions on the desirability of regulation.
We also introduce the notion of a Public Option ISP, an ISP that carries
traffic in a network neutral manner. Our major findings are (i) in a
monopolistic scenario, network neutral regulations benefit consumers; however,
the introduction of a Public Option ISP is even better for consumers, as it
aligns the interests of the monopolistic ISP with the consumer surplus and (ii)
in an oligopolistic situation, the presence of a Public Option ISP is again
preferable to network neutral regulations, although the presence of competing
price-discriminating ISPs provides the most desirable situation for the
consumers.

spaces and A is a closed subset of X, we show that the adjunction space X\cup_f
Y with the quotient uniformity (hence also with the topology thereof) is
metrizable, by an explicit metric. This yields natural constructions of cone,
join and mapping cylinder in the category of metrizable uniform spaces, which
we show to coincide with those based on subspace (of a normed linear space); on
product (with a cone); and on the isotropy of the l_2 metric.
  2) We revisit Isbell's theory of uniform ANRs, as refined by Garg and Nhu in
the metrizable case. The iterated loop spaces \Omega^n P of a pointed compact
polyhedron P are shown to be uniform ANRs. Four characterizations of uniform
ANRs among metrizable uniform spaces X are given: (i) the completion of X is a
uniform ANR, and the remainder is uniformly a Z-set in the completion; (ii) X
is uniformly locally contractible and satisfies the Hahn approximation
property; (iii) X is uniformly \epsilon-homotopy dominated by a uniform ANR for
each \epsilon>0; (iv) X is an inverse limit of uniform ANRs with ""nearly

profile showed significant evolution over the outburst. It showed complex

of the outburst. On some days, a sharp dip like feature was seen which
disappeared at the end of the outburst; when the profile evolved into a
sinusoidal shape. At low energies, the pulse profiles appeared complex,
consisting of multiple peaks and a narrow minimum. The amplitude of the second
brightest peak in low energies decreased with energy, and above 12 keV, the
shape of the pulse profile changed to a single broad peak with a dip like
feature. The dip had energy dependence, both in phase and in width. We detected
Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPO) at 0.125 Hz with a harmonic. The QPO feature
had a low rms value of 2.9% and it showed a positive energy dependence up to 40
keV with the rms value increasing to 9% at 40 keV. The QPO frequency decreased

with a high energy cut-off and iron fluorescent line emission. For a few of the
observations carried out during the decay of the outburst, the partial covering
absorption component is found to change to single component absorption. We also
found that the partial covering and high energy cut-off parameters vary

constraint to galactic chemical evolution models. However, this requires
detailed radiative transfer (RT) modeling of individual stars, which becomes
impractical for large data sets. Another approach is to select the best-fit
spectral energy distribution (SED) from a grid of dust shell models, allowing
for a faster determination of the luminosities and mass-loss rates for entire
samples. We have developed the Grid of RSG and AGB ModelS (GRAMS) to measure
the mass-loss return from evolved stars. The models span the range of stellar,
dust shell and grain properties relevant to evolved stars. In this paper we
present the carbon-star grid and compare our results with data of Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) carbon stars from the SAGE and SAGE-Spec programs. We
generate spherically symmetric dust shell models using the 2Dust code, with
hydrostatic models for the central stars. We explore five values of the inner
radius R_in of the dust shell (1.5, 3, 4.5, 7 and 12 R_star). We use amorphous
carbon dust mixed with 10% silicon carbide by mass. The grain sizes follows a
KMH distribution. The models span 26 values of 11.3 um optical depth, ranging
from 0.001 to 4. For each model, 2Dust calculates the output SED from 0.2 to
200 um. Over 12,000 models have dust temperatures below 1800 K. The GRAMS
synthetic photometry is in good agreement with SAGE photometry for LMC
carbon-rich and extreme AGB star candidates, as well as spectroscopically
confirmed carbon stars from the SAGE-Spec study. Our models reproduce the IRAC
colors of most of the extreme AGB star candidates, consistent with the
expectation that a majority of these enshrouded stars have carbon-rich dust.
Finally, we fit the SEDs of some well-studied carbon stars and compare the
resulting luminosities and mass-loss rates with those from previous studies.

  volatilities and their correlation matrix",,,,,"stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our article considers a regression model with observed factors. The observed
factors have a flexible stochastic volatility structure that has separate
dynamics for the volatilities and the correlation matrix. The correlation
matrix of the factors is time-varying and its evolution is described by an
inverse Wishart process. The model specifies the evolution of the observed
volatilities flexibly and is particularly attractive when the dimension of the
observations is high. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to
estimate the model. It is straightforward to use this algorithm to obtain the
predictive distributions of future observations and to carry out model
selection. The model is illustrated and compared to other Wishart-type factor
multivariate stochastic volatility models using various empirical data
including monthly stock returns and portfolio weighted returns. The evidence
suggests that our model has better predictive performance. The paper also
allows the idiosyncratic errors to follow individual stochastic volatility
processes in order to deal with more volatile data such as daily or weekly
stock returns.

during the core helium flash is commonly encountered during the evolution of
metal-free and extremely metal-poor low-mass stars. With specifically designed
multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we aim to prove that an entropy
barrier is no obstacle for the growth of the helium-burning shell convection
zone in the helium core of a metal-rich Pop I star, i.e. convection can
penetrate into the hydrogen-rich layers for these stars, too. We further study
whether this is also possible in one-dimensional stellar evolutionary
calculations. Our hydrodynamical simulations show that the helium-burning shell
convection zone in the helium core moves across the entropy barrier and reaches
the hydrogen-rich layers. This leads to mixing of protons into the hotter
layers of the core and to a rapid increase of the nuclear energy production at
the upper edge of the helium-burning convection shell - the hydrogen injection
flash. As a result a second convection zone appears in the hydrogen-rich
layers. Contrary to 1D models, the entropy barrier separating the two
convective shells from each other is largely permeable to chemical transport
when allowing for multidimensional flow, and consequently, hydrogen is
continuously mixed deep into the helium core. We find it difficult to achieve
such a behavior in one-dimensional stellar evolutionary calculations.

and correcting actions to be taken to enhance its volumetric accuracy. Several
procedures exist, involving either lengthy individual test for each geometric
error or faster single tests to identify all errors at once. This study focuses
on the closed kinematic Cartesian chain method which uses a single setup test
to identify the eight link errors of a five axis machine tool. The
identification is based on volumetric error measurements for different poses
with a non-contact measuring instrument called CapBall, developed in house. In
order to evaluate the uncertainty on each identified error, a multi-output
Monte Carlo approach is implemented. Uncertainty sources in the measurement and
identification chain - such as sensors output, machine drift and frame
transformation uncertainties - can be included in the model and propagated to
the identified errors. The estimated uncertainties are finally compared to
experimental results to assess the method. It shows that the effect of the
drift, a disturbance, must be simulated as a function of time the Monte Carlo
approach. The machine drift is found to be an important uncertainty in sources
for the machine tested.

costs for each algorithm are derived based on the number of scalar values that
are required for communication and storage at each node. Numerical examples are
provided to illustrate the empirical convergence rate of the four algorithms in
