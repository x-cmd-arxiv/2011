long ago by Ecker et al. As a significant phenomenological application, we
reassess the $K\to 3\pi$ decays in the light of the holographic model. Previous
models found a fine-tuned cancellation of resonance exchange in these decays,
which was both conceptually puzzling and quantitatively in disagreement with
experimental results. The holographic model we build is an illustrative

determining the spin-polarization dependence of the ground-state energy within
the self-consistent mean-field theory of Singwi et al. (STLS). Results are
presented for three different devices, viz. the Si (100) inversion layer, the
AlAs quantum well, and the GaAs heterojunction-insulated gate field-effect
transistor. We find a fairly good agreement with experiments for the Si (100)
system, on most of the experimental density range, whereas the agreement for
the AlAs and GaAs systems is less satisfactory; in all cases, however, it is
vital to include the characteristic device parameters like the valley
degeneracy, the finite transverse thickness, etc. Further, the STLS theory
predicts an abrupt spin-polarization transition at a sufficiently low electron
density irrespective of the valley degeneracy and/or the finite thickness, with
the partially spin-polarized states remaining unstable. Moreover, in the Si
(100) inversion layer, the spin-polarization transition is preceded by the
simultaneous valley- and spin- polarization; for its zero thickness model,
these transitions however grossly disagree with the recent quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. This drawback of the STLS theory is traced to its inaccuracy in
treating electron correlations, which in turn become more and more important as
the number of independent components (spin and valley) increases.

than predicted first showed up ~40 years ago at frequencies below ~3 GHz. But
it was soon found that the observations could be explained by throwing out the
uniform density models and replacing them with variable density ones. However,
this problem re-appeared recently when a mysterious line narrowing above
quantum numbers of (n,\Delta n) = (202,8) was reported from sensitive
observations of Orion and W51 near 6 GHz. Here it is demonstrated that the
narrowing is unlikely to be caused by the data processing technique and
therefore must be source related. It is further demonstrated that the observed
line narrowing can be tied to one of the fundamental properties of radio
recombination lines; namely the fact that the spacing of adjacent n-transitions
increases with frequency. The line narrowing is observed to begin when the
n-transition density, D_{n}, exceeds ~11.6 transitions per GHz. This may imply
that it is somehow related either to a previously overlooked effect in the
impact broadening process, or to some unknown parallel process, that is tied to
the separation between adjacent n-transitions. Based on these results it can be
concluded, as has also been concluded in several theoretical investigations,
that the observed line narrowing is not tied to a fixed range of either n or
\Delta n.

memoization and change-propagation, it involves both non-determinism (due to
memoization) and mutation (due to change propagation). Our consistency theorem
states that the non-determinism is not harmful: any two evaluations of the same

presented from specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements that a
substantial fraction of the Fermi surface survives the onset of spin density
wave (SDW) order at the Neel temperature TN=88 K, and its subsequent
commensurate lockin transition at T2=26.4 K. The specific heat below T2
consists of a normal metallic component from the ungapped parts of the Fermi
surface, and a Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer (BCS) component that represents the
SDW gapping of the Fermi surface. A large Kadowaki-Woods ratio is found at low
temperatures, showing that the ground state of CaFe4As3 is a strongly
interacting Fermi liquid. The thermal conductivity of CaFe4As3 is an order of
magnitude smaller than those of conventional metals at all temperatures, due to
a strong phonon scattering. The thermoelectric power displays a sign change
from positive to negative indicating that a partial gap forms at the Fermi
level with the onset of commensurate spin density wave order at T2=26.4 K. The
small value of the thermopower and the enhancements of the resistivity due to
gap formation and strong quasiparticle interactions offset the low value of the
thermal conductivity, yielding only a modest value for the thermoelectric
figure of merit Z < 5x10^-6 1/K in CaFe4As3. The results of ab initio
electronic structure calculations are reported, confirming that the sign change
in the thermopower at T2 is reflected by a sign change in the slope of the
density of states at the Fermi level. Values for the quasiparticle
renormalization are derived from measurements of the specific heat and
thermopower, indicating that as T->0, CaFe4As3 is among the most strongly
correlated of the known Fe-based pnictide and chalcogenide systems.

with loops. One might hope to compensate for the approximation by adjusting
model parameters. Learning algorithms for this purpose have been explored
previously, and the claim has been made that every set of locally consistent
marginals can arise from belief propagation run on a graphical model. On the
contrary, here we show that many probability distributions have marginals that
cannot be reached by belief propagation using any set of model parameters or
any learning algorithm. We call such marginals `unbelievable.' This problem
occurs whenever the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is not positive-definite
at the target marginals. All learning algorithms for belief propagation
necessarily fail in these cases, producing beliefs or sets of beliefs that may
even be worse than the pre-learning approximation. We then show that averaging
inaccurate beliefs, each obtained from belief propagation using model
parameters perturbed about some learned mean values, can achieve the
unbelievable marginals.

edges are added randomly one at a time to a graph. A classical result of
Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi states that the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi process undergoes a
phase transition, which takes place when the number of edges reaches n/2 (we
say at time 1) and a giant component emerges. Since this seminal work of
Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi, various random graph models have been introduced and
studied. In this paper we study the so-called Bohman-Frieze process, a simple
modification of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi process. The Bohman-Frieze process
begins with an empty graph on n vertices. At each step two random edges are
present and if the first edge would join two isolated vertices, it is added to
a graph; otherwise the second edge is added. We present several new results on
the phase transition of the Bohman-Frieze random graph process. We show that
the Bohman-Frieze process has a qualitatively similar phase transition to the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi process in terms of the size and structure of the
components near the critical point. We prove that all components at time
t_c-\eps (that is, when the number of edges are (t_c-\eps) n/2) are trees or
unicyclic components and that the largest component is of size \Omega(\eps^{-2}
\log n). Further, at t_c + \eps, all components apart from the giant component
are trees or unicyclic and the size of the second-largest component is
\Theta(\eps^{-2} \log n). Each of these results corresponds to an analogous
well-known result for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi process. Our methods include
combinatorial arguments and a combination of the differential equation method
for random processes with singularity analysis of generating functions which
satisfy quasi-linear partial differential equations.

star, like in the HR 8799 system, challenges theories of planet formation. A
possible formation mechanism involves the fragmentation of massive
self-gravitating discs into clumps. While the conditions for fragmentation have
been extensively studied, little is known of the subsequent evolution of these
giant planet embryos, in particular their expected orbital migration. Assuming
a single planet has formed by fragmentation, we investigate its interaction
with the gravitoturbulent disc it is embedded in. Two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations are used with a simple prescription for the disc
cooling. A steady gravitoturbulent disc is first set up, after which
simulations are restarted including a planet with a range of masses
approximately equal to the clump's initial mass expected in fragmenting discs.
Planets rapidly migrate inwards, despite the stochastic kicks due to the
turbulent density fluctuations. We show that the migration timescale is
essentially that of type I migration, with the planets having no time to open a
gap. In discs with aspect ratio ~ 0.1 at their forming location, planets with a
mass comparable to, or larger than Jupiter's can migrate in as short as 10000
years, that is, about 10 orbits at 100 AU. Massive planets formed at large
separation from their star by gravitational instability are thus unlikely to
stay in place, and should rapidly migrate towards the inner parts of
protoplanetary discs, regardless of the planet mass.

failures, a number of methods such as SONET rings, protection cycles, and
source rerouting have been investigated. Two important considerations in such
approaches are the recovery time and the needed spare capacity to complete the
recovery. Usually, these techniques attempt to achieve a recovery time less
than 50 ms. In this paper we introduce an approach that provides link failure
recovery in a hitless manner, or without any appreciable delay. This is
achieved by means of a method called diversity coding. We present an algorithm
for the design of an overlay network to achieve recovery from single link
failures in arbitrary networks via diversity coding. This algorithm is designed
to minimize spare capacity for recovery. We compare the recovery time and spare
capacity performance of this algorithm against conventional techniques in terms
of recovery time, spare capacity, and a joint metric called Quality of Recovery
(QoR). QoR incorporates both the spare capacity percentages and worst case
recovery times. Based on these results, we conclude that the proposed technique
provides much shorter recovery times while achieving similar extra capacity, or
better QoR performance overall.

extrasolar giant planets imaged to date are dusty. Planets with dusty

near-infrared, as has been observed from some field L dwarfs. The asymmetry
required in the thermal radiation field to produce polarization may arise
either from the rotation-induced oblateness or from surface inhomogeneities,
such as partial cloudiness. While it is not possible at present to predict the
extent to which atmospheric dynamics on a given planet may produce surface
inhomogeneities substantial enough to produce net non-zero disk integrated
polarization, the contribution of rotation-induced oblateness can be estimated.
Using a self-consistent, spatially homogeneous atmospheric model and a multiple
scattering polarization formalism for this class of exoplanets, we show that
polarization on the order of 1% may arise due to the rotation-induced
oblateness of the planets. The degree of polarization for cloudy planets should
peak at the same wavelengths at which the planets are brightest in the
near-infrared. The observed polarization may be even higher if surface
inhomogeneities exist and play a significant role. Polarized radiation from
self-luminous gas giant exoplanets, if detected, provides an additional tool to
characterize these young planets and a new method to constrain their surface
gravity and masses.

metallicities, bluer colors, smaller sizes, and less extinction, consistent

within dust-enshrouded environments. Yet, the exact amount of star-forming
activity that took place in high-redshift dusty galaxies currently missed by

COSMOS we determined the fraction of luminous star-forming galaxies at 1.5<z<3
escaping the traditional color selection techniques because of dust extinction,
as well as their contribution to the cosmic star formation density at high
redshift. We find that the BzK criterion offers an almost complete (~90%)
identification of the 24mic sources at 1.4<z<2.5, while the BM/BX criterion
miss 50% of the MIPS population. Similarly the criterion based on the presence
of a stellar bump in massive sources (so-called ""IRAC peakers"") miss up to 40%
of the IR luminosity density and only 25% of the IR energy density at z~2 is
produced by Optically-Faint IR-bright galaxies selected based on their extreme
mid-IR to optical flux ratios. We conclude that color selections of distant
star-forming galaxies must be used with lots of care given the substantial bias
they can suffer. In particular, the effect of dust extinction strongly impacts
the completeness of identifications at the bright end of the bolometric
luminosity function, which implies large and uncertain extrapolations to
account for the contribution of dusty galaxies missed by these selections. In
the context of forthcoming facilities that will operate at long wavelengths
(e.g., $JWST$, ALMA, SAFARI, EVLA, SKA), this emphasizes the importance of
minimizing the extinction biases when probing the activity of star formation in

The model demonstrates how fluctuations in the central potential irreversibly
transfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a dark matter
core. A supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore the
essential ingredient. The framework, based on a novel impulsive approximation,
breaks with the reliance on adiabatic approximations which are inappropriate in
the rapidly-changing limit. It shows that both outflows and galactic fountains
can give rise to cusp-flattening, even when only a few per cent of the baryons

suggests that constant density dark matter cores will be generated in systems

the friction is enhanced gravitationally at high energies. In this respect,
this new interaction makes virtually any potential adequate for inflation while

analytic methods: the peak-background split framework, and brute force
calculation in a barrier crossing model, obtaining agreement between the two.
We find a simple, theoretically motivated expression for halo bias which agrees
with N-body simulations and can be used to constrain g_{NL} from observations.
We discuss practical caveats to constraining g_{NL} using only observable
properties of a tracer population, and argue that constraints obtained from

uncertainties in modeling the halo occupation distribution of the population.

Tully-Fisher relations for a sample of field galaxies taken from an homogeneous
Fabry-Perot sample of galaxies (the GHASP survey). The main advantage of GHASP
over other samples is that maximum rotational velocities were estimated from 2D
velocity fields, avoiding assumptions about the inclination and position angle
of the galaxies. By combining these data with 2MASS photometry, optical colors,
HI masses and different mass-to-light ratio estimators, we found a slope of
4.48\pm0.38 and 3.64\pm0.28 for the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation,
respectively. We found that these values do not change significantly when
different mass-to-light ratios recipes were used. We also point out, for the
first time, that rising rotation curves as well as asymmetric rotation curves
show a larger dispersion in the Tully-Fisher relation than flat ones or than
symmetric ones. Using the baryonic mass and the optical radius of galaxies, we
found that the surface baryonic mass density is almost constant for all the
galaxies of this sample. In this study we also emphasize the presence of a
break in the NIR Tully-Fisher relation at M(H,K)\sim-20 and we confirm that
late-type galaxies present higher total-to-baryonic mass ratios than early-type
spirals, suggesting that supernova feedback is actually an important issue in
late-type spirals. Due to the well defined sample selection criteria and the
homogeneity of the data analysis, the Tully-Fisher relation for GHASP galaxies
can be used as a reference for the study of this relation in other environments
and at higher redshifts.

individual gets malaria infection during invasion by helminths larvae. In
absence of immune response, our results show that the antigens invade the blood
system if the rate of red cell rupture per invading merozoite is greater than
one. If fewer merozoites are released, the initial state is globally
asymptotically stable. If more merozoites are released, there exists
malaria-only endemic point. However, both antigens coexist if the mean
infection burden is greater than one. In this case, there is a threshold value
for drug action below which no recovery of host is expected. In presence of
immune response, three equilibrium states exist. The initial invasion state,
and secondly, the unstable state when the immune population has been triggered
and the antigens have been eliminated. The third state represents the endemic
state which is stable if the infection-induced rupture rate per erythrocyte
with immune activation is less than the total mortality of the erythrocytes. A
model for severity of the co-infection shows that an immune response will be
delayed until immunological barrier values for malaria and helminths are
exceeded.

X-ray emission does not necessarily correlate with the presence of a magnetic
field. We analyze the UV spectra of five non-supergiant B stars with magnetic
fields by means of non-LTE iron-blanketed model atmospheres. The latter are
calculated with the PoWR code, which treats the photosphere as well as the the
wind, and also accounts for X-rays. Our models accurately fit the stellar
photospheric spectra in the optical and the UV. The parameters of X-ray
emission, temperature and flux are included in the model in accordance with
observations. We confirm the earlier findings that the filling factors of X-ray
emitting material are very high. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic early
type B stars studied here have weak winds. The mass-loss rates are
significantly lower than predicted by hydrodynamically consistent models. We
find that, although the X-rays strongly affect the ionization structure of the
wind, this effect is not sufficient in reducing the total radiative
acceleration. When the X-rays are accounted for at the intensity and
temperatures observed, there is still sufficient radiative acceleration to
drive stronger mass-loss than we empirically infer from the UV spectral lines.

Stickelberger splitting maps give an immediate proof of the annihilation of the
groups of divisible elements $div K_{2n}(F)_l$ of the even $K$--theory of the
top field by higher Stickelberger elements, for all odd primes $l$. This
generalizes the results of \cite{Ba1}, which only deals with CM abelian
extensions of $\Bbb Q$. The techniques involved in constructing our Euler
systems at this level of generality are quite different from those used in
\cite{BG1}, where an Euler system in the odd $K$--theory with finite
coefficients of abelian CM extensions of $\Bbb Q$ was given. We work under the
assumption that the Iwasawa $\mu$--invariant conjecture holds. This permits us
to make use of the recent results of Greither-Popescu \cite{GP} on the \'etale
Coates-Sinnott conjecture for arbitrary abelian extensions of totally real

will use the Euler systems constructed in this paper to obtain information on
the groups of divisible elements $div K_{2n}(F)_l$, for all $n>0$ and odd $l$.
It is known that the structure of these groups is intimately related to some of

rates. Simulations are done for different values of the Lundquist number to
determine scaling. In the high-Lundquist number limit, the coronal heating rate
obtained so far is consistent with a trend that is independent of the Lundquist

same limit the average magnetic energy built up by the random footpoint motion
tends to have a much weaker dependence on the Lundquist number than that in the

disruption when the equilibrium becomes unstable. We will present scaling
analysis showing that when the dissipation time is comparable or larger than

that isotropic polarization response can be achieved by increasing the number

multi-layer quantum dot stacks containing up to nine quantum dot layers by
linearly polarized PL measurements and by carrying out a systematic set of
multi-million atom simulations. The atomistic modeling and simulations allow us
to include correct symmetry properties in the calculations of the optical
spectra: a factor critical to explain the experimental evidence. The values of
the degree of polarization (DOP) calculated from our model follows the trends
of the experimental data. We also present detailed physical insight by
examining strain profiles, band edges diagrams and wave function plots.
Multi-directional PL measurements and calculations of the DOP reveal a unique
property of InAs quantum dot stacks that the TE response is anisotropic in the
plane of the stacks. Therefore a single value of the DOP is not sufficient to
fully characterize the polarization response. We explain this anisotropy of the
TE-modes by orientation of hole wave functions along the [-110] direction. Our
results provide a new insight that isotropic polarization response measured in
the experimental PL spectra is due to two factors: (i) TM[001]-mode
contributions increase due to enhanced intermixing of HH and LH bands, and (ii)
TE[110]-mode contributions reduce significantly due to hole wave function
alignment along the [-110] direction. We also present optical spectra for
various geometry configurations of quantum dot stacks to provide a guide to
experimentalists for the design of multi-layer QD stacks for optical devices.
Our results predict that the QD stacks with identical layers will exhibit lower

to an additive error of at most eps, in polynomial time. For values sampled
from Monotone Hazard Rate (MHR) distributions, we achieve a (1-eps)-fraction of
the optimal revenue in polynomial time, while for values sampled from regular
distributions the same revenue guarantees are achieved in quasi-polynomial
time.
  Our algorithm for bounded distributions applies probabilistic techniques to
understand the statistical properties of revenue distributions, obtaining a
reduction in the search space of the algorithm via dynamic programming.
Adapting this approach to MHR and regular distributions requires the proof of
novel extreme value theorems for such distributions.
  As a byproduct, our techniques establish structural properties of
approximately-optimal and near-optimal solutions. We show that, for values
independently distributed according to MHR distributions, pricing all items at
the same price achieves a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. Moreover,
for all eps >0, g(1/eps) distinct prices suffice to obtain a (1-eps)-fraction
of the optimal revenue, where g(1/eps) is quadratic in 1/eps and independent of
n. Similarly, for all eps>0 and n>0, at most g(1/(eps log n)) distinct prices
suffice if the values are independently distributed according to regular
distributions, where g() is a polynomial function. Finally, when the values are
i.i.d. from some MHR distribution, we show that, if n is a sufficiently large

efficient algorithms that provide improved performance and functionality in all
aspects of the program. It features a new user interface, several new output
formats including C++ process libraries for Pythia 8, and full compatibility
with FeynRules for new physics models implementation, allowing for event
generation for any model that can be written in the form of a Lagrangian.
MadGraph 5 builds on the same philosophy as the previous versions, and its
design allows it to be used as a collaborative platform where theoretical,
phenomenological and simulation projects can be developed and then distributed
to the high-energy community. We describe the ideas and the most important
developments of the code and illustrate its capabilities through a few simple
phenomenological examples.

ages and dramatically increase the abundance of compact substructures. For low

by cold, dense gas filaments, suggesting angular momentum transport by gas
differs from that by dark matter. Revisiting this issue using high-resolution
cosmological hydrodynamics simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, we find
that at the time of accretion, gas and dark matter do carry a similar amount of
specific angular momentum, but that it is systematically higher than that of
the dark matter halo as a whole. At high redshift, freshly accreted gas rapidly
streams into the central region of the halo, directly depositing this large
amount of angular momentum within a sphere of radius r=0.1rvir. In contrast,
dark matter particles pass through the central region unscathed, and a fraction
of them ends up populating the outer regions of the halo (r/rvir>0.1),
redistributing angular momentum in the process. As a result, large-scale
motions of the cosmic web have to be considered as the origin of gas angular
momentum rather than its virialised dark matter halo host. This generic result
holds for halos of all masses at all redshifts, as radiative cooling ensures
that a significant fraction of baryons remain trapped at the centre of the
halos. Despite this injection of angular momentum enriched gas, we predict an
amount for stellar discs which is in fair agreement with observations at z=0.
This arises because the total specific angular momentum of the baryons remains
close to that of dark matter halos. We propose a new scenario where gas
efficiently carries the angular momentum generated by large-scale structure
motions deep inside dark matter halos, redistributing it only in the vicinity
of the disc.

ice layers preserved in the mantle beneath. The model includes a treatment of
the competition between barrier-mediated surface reactions and thermal-hopping
processes. The results show excellent agreement with the observed behavior of
CO2, CO and water ice in the interstellar medium. The reaction of the OH
radical with CO is found to be efficient enough to account for CO2 ice
production in dark clouds. At low visual extinctions, with dust temperatures
~12 K, CO2 is formed by direct diffusion and reaction of CO with OH; we
associate the resultant CO2-rich ice with the observational polar CO2
signature. CH4 ice is well correlated with this component. At higher
extinctions, with lower dust temperatures, CO is relatively immobile and thus
abundant; however, the reaction of H and O atop a CO molecule allows OH and CO
to meet rapidly enough to produce a CO:CO2 ratio in the range ~2--4, which we
associate with apolar signatures. We suggest that the observational apolar
CO2/CO ice signatures in dark clouds result from a strongly segregated CO:H2O
ice, in which CO2 resides almost exclusively within the CO component. Observed
visual-extinction thresholds for CO2, CO and H2O are well reproduced by

central cluster galaxy in 2A 0335+096 (z=0.0349). The H2 v=1-0 S(1) emission is
concentrated in two peaks within 600 pc of the nucleus and fainter but
kinematically-active emission extends towards the nucleus. The H2 is in a
rotating structure which aligns with, and appears to have been accreted from, a
stream of H-alpha emission extending over 14 kpc towards a companion galaxy.
The projected rotation axis aligns with the 5 GHz radio lobes.
  This H2 traces the known 1.2E9 Msun CO-emitting reservoir; limits on the
Br-gamma emission confirm that the H2 emission is not excited by star
formation, which occurs at a rate of less than 1 Msun/yr in this gas. If its
accretion onto the black hole can be regulated whilst star formation remains
suppressed, the reservoir could last for at least 1 Gyr; the simultaneous
accretion of just ~ 5 per cent of the gas could drive a series of AGN outbursts
which offset X-ray cooling in the cluster core for the full 1 Gyr.
Alternatively, if the regulation is ineffective and the bulk of the H2 accretes
within a few orbital periods (25-100 Myr), the resulting 1E62 erg outburst
would be among the most powerful cluster AGN outbursts known. In either case,
these observations further support cold feedback scenarios for AGN heating.

on the properties of the gravitational-wave (GW) emission. To see the effects
of rotation in the non-linear postbounce phase, we give a uniform rotation on
the flow advecting from the outer boundary of the iron core, whose specific
angular momentum is assumed to agree with recent stellar evolution models. We
compute fifteen 3D models in which the initial angular momentum as well as the
input neutrino luminosities from the protoneutron star are changed in a
systematic manner. By performing a ray-tracing analysis, we accurately estimate
the GW amplitudes generated by anisotropic neutrino emission. Our results show
that the gravitational waveforms from neutrinos in models that include rotation
exhibit a common feature otherwise they vary much more stochastically in the
absence of rotation. The breaking of the stochasticity stems from the excess of
the neutrino emission parallel to the spin axis. This is because the
compression of matter is more enhanced in the vicinity of the equatorial plane
due to the growth of the spiral SASI modes, leading to the formation of spiral
flows circulating around the spin axis with higher temperatures. We point out
that a recently proposed future space interferometers like Fabry-Perot type
DECIGO would permit detection of these signals for a Galactic supernova.

examine the conditions or criteria whereby a macroscopic quantum system may

one in the Galaxy,V348 Sgr, and one lying in the LMC, HV 2671. These two
objects may constitute a link between the RCB stars and the late Wolf-Rayet
([WCL]) class of central stars of planetary nebula (CSPNe) such as CPD -56 8032
that has little or no hydrogen in their atmospheres. HV 2671 and V348 Sgr are
members of a rare subclass that has significantly higher effective temperatures
than most RCB stars, but sharing the traits of hydrogen deficiency and dust
formation that define the cooler RCB stars. The [WC] CSPNe star, CPD -56 8032,
displays evidence for dual-dust chemistry showing both PAHs and crystalline
silicates in its mid-IR spectrum. HV 2671 shows strong PAH emission but shows
no sign of having crystalline silicates. The spectrum of V348 Sgr is very
different from those of CPD -56 8032 and HV 2671. The PAH emission seen
strongly in the other two stars is not present. Instead, the spectrum is
dominated by a broad emission centered at about 8.2 micron. The mid-IR spectrum
of CPD -56 8032 shows emission features that may be associated with C60. The
other two stars do not show evidence for C60. HV 2671 has also been detected by
Herschel/PACS and SPIRE. V348 Sgr and CPD -56 8032 have been detected by
AKARI/FIS. These data were combined with Spitzer, IRAS, 2MASS and other
photometry to produce their spectral energy distributions from the visible to
the far-IR. Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling was used to study the
circumstellar dust around these stars. HV 2671 and CPD -56 8032 require both a
flared inner disk with warm dust and an extended diffuse envelope with cold
dust to to fit their SEDs. The SED of V348 Sgr can be fit with a much smaller
disk and envelope.

evolutionary algorithms. In particular, there have been many experimental
studies which showed the effectiveness of adapting mutation rates for various
static optimization problems. Given the perceived effectiveness of adaptive and
self-adaptive mutation for static optimization problems, there have been
speculations that adaptive and self-adaptive mutation can benefit dynamic
optimization problems even more since adaptation and self-adaptation are
capable of following a dynamic environment. However, few theoretical results
are available in analyzing rigorously evolutionary algorithms for dynamic
optimization problems. It is unclear when adaptive and self-adaptive mutation
rates are likely to be useful for evolutionary algorithms in solving dynamic
optimization problems. This paper provides the first rigorous analysis of
adaptive mutation and its impact on the computation times of evolutionary
algorithms in solving certain dynamic optimization problems. More specifically,
for both individual-based and population-based EAs, we have shown that any
time-variable mutation rate scheme will not significantly outperform a fixed
mutation rate on some dynamic optimization problem instances. The proofs also
offer some insights into conditions under which any time-variable mutation
scheme is unlikely to be useful and into the relationships between the problem
characteristics and algorithmic features (e.g., different mutation schemes).

classical radio interferometry and polarimetry, as shown in the previous three
papers of this series. However, recent practical and theoretical developments,
such as phased array feeds (PAFs), aperture arrays (AAs) and wide-field
polarimetry, are exposing limitations of the formalism. This paper aims to
develop a more general formalism that can be used to both clearly define the
limitations of the matrix RIME, and to describe observational scenarios that
lie outside these limitations. Some assumptions underlying the matrix RIME are
explicated and analysed in detail. To this purpose, an array correlation matrix
(ACM) formalism is explored. This proves of limited use; it is shown that
matrix algebra is simply not a sufficiently flexible tool for the job. To
overcome these limitations, a more general formalism based on tensors and the
Einstein notation is proposed and explored both theoretically, and with a view
to practical implementations. The tensor formalism elegantly yields generalized
RIMEs describing beamforming, mutual coupling, and wide-field polarimetry in
one equation. It is shown that under the explicated assumptions, tensor
equations reduce to the 2x2 RIME. From a practical point of view, some methods
for implementing tensor equations in an optimal way are proposed and analysed.
The tensor RIME is a powerful means of describing observational scenarios not
amenable to the matrix RIME. Even in cases where the latter remains applicable,
the tensor formalism can be a valuable tool for understanding the limits of
such applicability.

collisions, discriminating between different models of hard parton-medium
interactions has been difficult. One important reason is that the pQCD parton
spectrum at RHIC kinematics is so steeply falling that distinguishing even a
moderate shift in parton energy from complete parton absorption is almost
impossible in observable quantities. In essence, energy loss models are
effectively only probed in the vicinity of zero energy loss and as a result,
only the pathlength dependence of energy loss offers some discriminating power
at RHIC kinematics. At LHC, this is no longer the case: Due to the much flatter
shape of the parton spectra originating from 2.76 AGeV collisions, the
available observables probe much deeper into the model dynamics. A simultaneous
fit of the nuclear suppression both at RHIC and LHC kinematics has thus a huge
potential to discriminate between various models with equally good description
of RHIC data alone.

ionization but varying total number density for each laser pulse analysis.
Under this state, if the influence of the variation of plasma morphology is
neglected, the sum of multiple spectral line intensities for the measured
element can be regarded proportional to the total number density of the
specific element, and the fluctuation of the total number density, or the
variation of ablation mass, was compensated for by the application of this
relationship. In the experiments with 29 brass alloy samples, the application
of this method to determine Cu concentration shows a significant improvement
over generally applied normalization method for measurement precision and
accuracy. The average RSD value, average value of the error bar, R2, RMSEP, and
average value of the maximum relative error were: 5.29%, 0.68%, 0.98, 2.72%,
16.97%, respectively, while the above parameter values for normalization with
the whole spectrum area were: 8.61%, 1.37%, 0.95, 3.28%, 29.19%, respectively.

comparatively strong internal connectivity, is a fundamental task for deeply
understanding the structure and function of a network. Yet, there is a lack of
formal criteria for defining communities and for testing their significance. We
propose a sharp definition which is based on a significance threshold. By means
of a lumped Markov chain model of a random walker, a quality measure called
""persistence probability"" is associated to a cluster. Then the cluster is
defined as an ""$\alpha$-community"" if such a probability is not smaller than
$\alpha$. Consistently, a partition composed of $\alpha$-communities is an
""$\alpha$-partition"". These definitions turn out to be very effective for
finding and testing communities. If a set of candidate partitions is available,
setting the desired $\alpha$-level allows one to immediately select the
$\alpha$-partition with the finest decomposition. Simultaneously, the
persistence probabilities quantify the significance of each single community.
Given its ability in individually assessing the quality of each cluster, this
approach can also disclose single well-defined communities even in networks
which overall do not possess a definite clusterized structure.

conservation is equivalent to the requirement that the quadrature is exact,

Mg II equivalent width at close galactocentric radii as compared to the red

equivalent width and galactic stellar mass of the host galaxy. We also find
that the distribution of Mg II absorption around group galaxies is more
extended than that for non-group galaxies, and that groups as a whole have more
extended radial profiles than individual galaxies. Interestingly, these effects
can be satisfactorily modeled by a simple superposition of the absorption
profiles of individual member galaxies, assuming that these are the same as
those of non-group galaxies, suggesting that the group environment may not
significantly enhance or diminish the Mg II absorption of individual galaxies.
We show that there is a strong azimuthal dependence of the Mg II absorption

strongly bipolar outflow aligned along the disk rotation axis. There is no
significant dependence of Mg II absorption on the apparent inclination angle of

dust-to-gas mass ratio. We derived the radial gradient of the dust-to-gas mass
ratio for all galaxies observed by HeViCS whose metallicity gradients are
available in the literature. They are all late type Sbc galaxies, namely
NGC4254, NGC4303, NGC4321, and NGC4501. We examined different dependencies on
metallicity of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor (\xco), used to transform the
$^{12}$CO observations into the amount of molecular hydrogen. We found that in
these galaxies the dust-to-gas mass ratio radial profile is extremely sensitive
to choice of the \xco\ value, since the molecular gas is the dominant component
in the inner parts. We found that for three galaxies of our sample, namely
NGC4254, NGC4321, and NGC4501, the slopes of the oxygen and of the dust-to-gas
radial gradients agree up to $\sim$0.6-0.7R$_{25}$ using \xco\ values in the
range 1/3-1/2 Galactic \xco. For NGC4303 a lower value of \xco$\sim0.1\times$
10$^{20}$ is necessary. We suggest that such low \xco\ values might be due to a
metallicity dependence of \xco (from close to linear for NGC4254, NGC4321, and
NGC4501 to superlinear for NGC4303), especially in the radial regions
R$_G<$0.6-0.7R$_{25}$ where the molecular gas dominates. On the other hand, the
outer regions, where the atomic gas component is dominant, are less affected by
the choice of \xco, and thus we cannot put constraints on its value.

  Conclusions unchanged. Any comments, reviews, critiques, or objections are

flat or closed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe admits one, and
only one, gauge-invariant quantity which describes the perturbation to the
energy density and which becomes equal to the usual Newtonian energy density in
the non-relativistic limit. The same holds true for the perturbation to the
particle number density. These facts exclude all definitions of gauge-invariant
quantities used to describe density perturbations in former theories. Using
these two new quantities, a manifestly covariant and gauge-invariant
cosmological perturbation theory, adapted to non-barotropic equations of state
for the pressure, has been developed. The new theory is valid for all scales
since metric gradients do not occur in the final evolution equations. The new
theory has an exact non-relativistic limit with a time-independent Newtonian
potential. The usual Newtonian perturbation theory is inadequate to study the
evolution of density perturbations. In the radiation-dominated era,
perturbations in the particle number density are gravitationally coupled to
perturbations in the total energy density, irrespective of the nature of the
particles. This implies that structure formation can commence only after
decoupling of matter and radiation. After decoupling of matter and radiation
density perturbations evolve diabatically, i.e., they exchange heat with their
environment. This heat loss of a perturbation may enhance the growth rate of
its mass sufficiently to explain stellar formation in the early universe, a
phenomenon not understood, as yet, without the additional assumption of the
existence of Cold Dark Matter. This theoretical observation is the main result
of this article.

When working with an extra-solar planet database, it is very useful to have a
taxonomy scale (classification) such as, for example, the Harvard
classification for stars. The taxonomy has to be easily interpreted and present
the most relevant information about extra-solar planets. I propose the
following the extra-solar planet taxonomy scale with four parameters. The first
parameter concerns the mass of an extra-solar planet in the form of the units
of the mass of other known planets, where M represents the mass of Mercury, E
that of Earth, N Neptune, and J Jupiter. The second parameter is the planet's
distance from its parent star (semi-major axis) described in logarithm with
base 10. The third parameter is the mean Dyson temperature of the extra-solar
planet, for which I established four main temperature classes; F represents the
Freezing class, W the Water Class, G the Gaseous Class, and R the Roasters
Class. I devised one additional class, however: P, the Pulsar Class, which
concerns extra-solar planets orbiting pulsar stars. The fourth parameter is
eccentricity. If the attributes of the surface of the extra-solar planet are
known, we are able to establish this additional parameter where t represents a
terrestrial planet, g a gaseous planet, and i an ice planet. According to this
taxonomy scale, for example, Earth is 1E0W0t, Neptune is 1N1.5F0i, and
extra-solar planet 55 Cnc e is 9E-1.8R1. Key words: Catalogues - Extra-solar

of the Ca II H line profile near and off the solar limb. We obtained a data set
of the Ca II H line in a field of view extending 20"" across the limb. We
analyzed the spectra for the properties of off-limb spectra. We used tracers of
the Doppler shifts, such as the location of the absorption core, the ratio of
the two emission peaks H2V and H2R, and intensity images at a fixed wavelength.
The average off-limb profiles show a smooth variation with increasing limb
distance. The line width increases up to a height of about 2 Mm above the limb.
The profile shape is fairly symmetric with nearly identical H2V and H2R
intensities; at a height of 5 Mm, it changes into a single Gaussian without
emission peaks. We find that all off-limb spectra show large Doppler shifts
that fluctuate on the smallest resolved spatial scales. The variation is more
prominent in cuts parallel to the solar limb than on those perpendicular to it.
As far as individual structures can be unequivocally identified at our spatial
resolution, we find a specific relation between intensity enhancements and
Doppler shifts: elongated brightenings are often flanked all along their
extension by velocities in opposite directions. The average off-limb spectra of
Ca II H present a good opportunity to test static chromospheric atmosphere
models because they lack the photospheric contribution that is present in
disk-center spectra. We suggest that the observed relation between intensity
enhancements and Doppler shifts could be caused by waves propagating along the
surfaces of flux tubes: an intrinsic twist of the flux tubes or a wave
propagation inclined to the tube axis would cause a helical shape of the
Doppler excursion, visible as opposite velocity at the sides of the flux tube.

permutation as given by a permutation matrix, then the following definition
suggests itself: A d-dimensional permutation of order n is an [n]^(d+1) array
of zeros and ones in which every ""line"" contains a unique 1 entry. A line here
is a set of entries of the form {(x_1,...,x_{i-1},y,x_{i+1},...,x_{d+1})}, for
y between 1 and n, some index i between 1 and d+1 and some choice of x_j in [n]
for all j except i. It is easy to observe that a one-dimensional permutation is
simply a permutation matrix and that a two-dimensional permutation is
synonymous with an order-n Latin square. We seek an estimate for the number of
d-dimensional permutations. Our main result is the following upper bound on
their number: ((1+o(1))(n/e^d))^(n^d).
  We tend to believe that this is actually the correct number, but the problem
of proving the complementary lower bound remains open. Our main tool is an
adaptation of Bregman's proof of the Minc conjecture on permanents. More
concretely, our approach is very close in spirit to Radhakrishnan's proof of
Bregman's theorem.

polycrystalline CeFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O alloys is presented. The magnetism of
CeFeAsO changes drastically upon P substitution on the As site. CeFePO is a
heavy fermion system without long range order whereas CeFeAsO exhibits a
Fe-3$d$ SDW type of ordering accompanied by a structural transition from
tetragonal ($TT$) to orthorhombic ($OT$) structure. Furthermore Ce-4$f^{1}$
orders antiferromagnetically (AFM) at low temperature. At the critical
concentration where the Fe-magnetism is diminished the Ce-Ce interaction
changes to a ferromagnetic (FM) type of ordering. Three representative samples
of the CeFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O ($x$=0.05, 0.3 and 0.9) series are systematically
investigated. 1) For the $x$=0.05 alloy a drastic change of the line width at
130 K indicates the AFM-SDW type of ordering of Fe and the structural change
from $TT$ to $OT$ phase. The line width roughly measures the internal field in
the ordered state and the transition is most likely first order. The small and
nearly constant shift for $^{31}$P and $^{75}$As suggests the presence of
competing hyperfine interactions between the nuclear spins and the 4$f$ and
3$d$ ions of Ce and Fe. 2) For the $x$=0.3 alloy, evolution of the Fe-SDW type
order takes place at around 70 K corroborating the results of bulk measurement
and $\mu SR$. Here we found strong evidence for phase separation of
paramagnetic and magnetic SDW phases. 3) In contrast to heavy fermion CeFePO
for the $x$=0.9 alloy a phase transition is found at 2 K. The field-dependent
NMR shift gives strong evidence of FM ordering. Above the ordering the spin
lattice relaxation rate $^{31}$(1/T$_{1}$) shows unconventional, non-Korringa
like behaviour which indicates a complex interplay of Kondo and FM
fluctuations.

under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning
probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that
decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis
we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This
assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because
they do not receive any pruning examples. This paper clarifies the different
variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its
algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions
than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the
analysis.

We term this problem on-line plan recognition under uncertainty and view it

terms of probabilistic inference, we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov Model
(AHMM), a novel type of stochastic processes, provide its dynamic Bayesian
network (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of this network. We then
describe an application of the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM
which allows us to construct an efficient, hybrid inference method for this
model. In terms of plan recognition, we propose a novel plan recognition
framework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model. The Rao-Blackwellised
hybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the independence properties
inherent in a model of plan execution, leading to an algorithm for online
probabilistic plan recognition that scales well with the number of levels in
the plan hierarchy. This illustrates that while stochastic models for plan
execution can be complex, they exhibit special structures which, if exploited,
can lead to efficient plan recognition algorithms. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the AHMM framework via a behaviour recognition system in a
complex spatial environment using distributed video surveillance data.

(mRNA) as the corresponding template, is called {\it translation}. Ribosome may
be regarded as a molecular motor for which the mRNA template serves also as the
track. Often several ribosomes may translate the same (mRNA) simultaneously.
The ribosomes bound simultaneously to a single mRNA transcript are the members
of a polyribosome (or, simply, {\it polysome}). Experimentally measured {\it
polysome profile} gives the distribution of polysome {\it sizes}. Recently a
breakthrough in determining the instantaneous {\it positions} of the ribosomes
on a given mRNA track has been achieved and the technique is called {\it
ribosome profiling} \cite{ingolia10,guo10}. Motivated by the success of these
techniques, we have studied the spatio-temporal organization of ribosomes by
extending a theoretical model that we have reported elsewhere \cite{sharma11}.
This extended version of our model incorporates not only (i) mechano-chemical
cycle of individual ribomes, and (ii) their steric interactions, but also (iii)
the effects of (a) kinetic proofreading, (b) translational infidelity, (c)
ribosome recycling, and (d) sequence inhomogeneities. The theoretical framework
developed here will serve in guiding further experiments and in analyzing the
data to gain deep insight into various kinetic processes involved in
translation.

dramatically in certain cases. Roughly, by observing a mentor, a
reinforcement-learning agent can extract information about its own capabilities
in, and the relative value of, unvisited parts of the state space. We study two

mentor have identical abilities, and one designed to deal with agents and
mentors with different action sets. We illustrate the benefits of implicit
imitation by integrating it with prioritized sweeping, and demonstrating
improved performance and convergence through observation of single and multiple
mentors. Though we make some stringent assumptions regarding observability and

at the fluctuating level. We observe for the first time this striking and
general phenomenon measuring current fluctuations in an isolated diffusive
system. While small fluctuations result from the sum of weakly-correlated local
events, for currents above a critical threshold the system self-organizes into
a coherent traveling wave which facilitates the current deviation by gathering
energy in a localized packet, thus breaking translation invariance. This
results in Gaussian statistics for small fluctuations but non-Gaussian tails
above the critical current. Our observations, which agree with predictions
derived from hydrodynamic fluctuation theory, strongly suggest that rare events
are generically associated with coherent, self-organized patterns which enhance
their probability.

the functional integral approach. The quark contributions to the
Dyson-Schwinger equations are derived and one-loop perturbative results for the
two-point functions are presented. The problem of confinement is addressed in
the heavy quark limit, by rewriting the generating functional of quantum
chromodynamics in terms of a heavy quark mass expansion. By restricting to
leading order in this expansion and considering only the two-point functions of
the Yang-Mills sector, the rainbow-ladder approximation to the gap and
Bethe-Salpeter equations is shown to be exact. Analytic nonperturbative
solutions to the Bethe-Salpeter equation for quark-antiquark bound states and
Faddeev equation for three-quark bound states, in the case of equal quark
separations, are presented. The quark-antiquark and three-quark confining
potentials are derived and a direct connection between the temporal gluon
propagator and the corresponding string tensions is found. It is shown that
only color singlet of quark-antiquark (meson) and qqq (baryon) states are
physically allowed. Moreover, the four-point Green's functions, in both
quark-antiquark and diquark channels, are explicitly derived. It is found that
the corresponding poles relate to the bound state energy of the heavy quark
systems, and a natural separation between physical and unphysical poles in the
Green's functions emerges.

near-ultraviolet/optical extinction curves associated with a sample of ~8300
strong (equivalent width > 1A) Mg II absorbers, with redshifts 0.4<z<2.2,
identified in Sloan Digital Sky survey (SDSS) spectra of quasars. Taking into
account the selection effects that result from dust extinction, including the
reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio of an absorber appearing in a reddened
quasar spectrum, we find a stronger dependence of E(B-V) on absorber rest
equivalent width (EW) than in other published work. The dependence of the
median reddening on EW can be reproduced by a power-law model:
E(B-V)=.8+/-3*10-4 * EW^(3.48+/-0.3) for 1.0A<EW<5.0A. Observed Mg II samples,
derived from flux-limited quasar surveys, are shown to suffer from significant
incompleteness at the level of 24+/-4 per cent for absorbers with EW>1A and
34+/-2 per cent for absorbers with EW>2A. Direct determination of the shape of
the near-ultraviolet extinction curves for absorbers as a function of E(B-V)
show evidence for systematic changes in the form of the extinction curves. At
low E(B-V) (>0.05), the extinction curve is well represented by a Small
Magellanic Cloud-like extinction curve. For intermediate E(B-V)s (<0.2),
approximately a third of MgII absorbers show evidence for a 2175A feature
similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud. For the small number of high
E(B-V) (>0.3) absorbers, the majority of which exhibit strong CaII 3935,3970
absorption, there is evidence for a 2175A feature as strong as that found in
the Milky Way. Application of the new results on the dust content of strong Mg
II absorbers shows that dusty absorbers can account for a significant
proportion, up to a factor of two, of the observed overdensity of absorbers
seen towards Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) sightlines, compared to sightlines towards
quasars in flux-limited samples. (Abridged)

and ionisation yields giving acceptable fits to the data were derived.
Efficiency and resolution effects are treated using a light collection Monte
Carlo, measured photomultiplier response profiles and hardware trigger studies.
A gradual fall in scintillation yield below ~40 keVnr is found, together with a
rising ionisation yield; both are in good agreement with the latest independent
measurements. The analysis method is applied to both the most recent ZEPLIN-III
data, acquired with a significantly upgraded detector and a
precision-calibrated Am-Be source, as well as to the earlier data from the
first run in 2008. A new method for deriving the recoil scintillation yield,
which includes sub-threshold S1 events, is also presented which confirms the

kinematical side, while on the dynamical side, Heavy Quark Effective Theory
(HQET) is applied to calculate the hadronic matrix elements between the baryons
Lambda_{b} and Lambda. The branching ratios(BR) and helicity asymmetry
parameters (alpha_{AS}) for Lambda_{b} --> Lambda J/psi, Lambda_{b} --> Lambda
rho^0 and Lambda_{b} --> Lambda omega have been calculated. Since both the
decay products are polarized, so they offer interesting opportunities to
perform tests of time reversal, CP violation and of CPT invariance. A model
independent parametrization is done via spin density matrix of the angular
distribution, polarizations and some of polarization correlations of the decay
products. The transverse component of the polarization and two polarization
correlations are sensitive to time reversal violations. Moreover several CP-
and CPT-odd observables are pointed out.
