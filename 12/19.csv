  figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article, we introduce iterative deterministic equivalents as a novel
technique for the performance analysis of communication systems whose channels
are modeled by complex combinations of independent random matrices. This
technique extends the deterministic equivalent approach for the study of
functionals of large random matrices to a broader class of random matrix models
which naturally arise as channel models in wireless communications. We present
two specific applications: First, we consider a multi-hop amplify-and-forward
(AF) MIMO relay channel with noise at each stage and derive deterministic
approximations of the mutual information after the Kth hop. Second, we study a
MIMO multiple access channel (MAC) where the channel between each transmitter
and the receiver is represented by the double-scattering channel model. We
provide deterministic approximations of the mutual information, the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and sum-rate with
minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detection and derive the asymptotically
optimal precoding matrices. In both scenarios, the approximations can be
computed by simple and provably converging fixed-point algorithms and are shown
to be almost surely tight in the limit when the number of antennas at each node
grows infinitely large. Simulations suggest that the approximations are
accurate for realistic system dimensions. The technique of iterative
deterministic equivalents can be easily extended to other channel models of
interest and is, therefore, also a new contribution to the field of random
matrix theory.

that allow a precise estimation of the background noise. As an alternative to
the background subtraction proposed in BeadStudio which leads to an important
loss of information by generating negative values, a background correction
method modeling the observed intensities as the sum of the exponentially
distributed signal and normally distributed noise has been developed.
Nevertheless, Wang and Ye (2011) display a kernel-based estimator of the signal
distribution on Illumina BeadArrays and suggest that a gamma distribution would
represent a better modeling of the signal density. Hence, the
normal-exponential modeling may not be appropriate for Illumina data and
background corrections derived from this model may lead to wrong estimation.
Results: We propose a more flexible modeling based on a gamma distributed
signal and a normal distributed background noise and develop the associated
background correction. Our model proves to be markedly more accurate to model
Illumina BeadArrays: on the one hand, this model offers a more correct fit of
the observed intensities. On the other hand, the comparison of the operating
characteristics of several background correction procedures on spike-in and on
normal-gamma simulated data shows high similarities, reinforcing the validation
of the normal-gamma modeling. The performance of the background corrections
based on the normal-gamma and normal-exponential models are compared on two
dilution data sets. Surprisingly, we observe that the implementation of a more
accurate parametrisation in the model-based background correction does not
increase the sensitivity. These results may be explained by the operating
characteristics of the estimators: the normal-gamma background correction
offers an improvement in terms of bias, but at the cost of a loss in precision.

$\rho(r)/\sigma^3(r)$ is approximately a power-law only in the range of halo
radius resolved by current simulations (down to 0.1% of the virial radius)
while it has a non-power law behavior below the quoted scale, with inner
profiles changing with mass. The non-power-law behavior is more evident for
halos constituted both of dark matter and baryons while halos constituted just
of dark matter and with angular momentum chosen to reproduce a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, are characterized by an
approximately power-law behavior. The results of the present paper lead to
conclude that density profiles of the NFW type are compatible with a power-law
behavior of $\rho(r)/\sigma^3(r)$, while those flattening to the halo center,
like those found in Del Popolo (2009) or the Einasto profile, or the Burkert
profile, cannot produce radial profile of the pseudo-phase-space density that
are power-laws at all radii. The results argue against universality of the

The LHC 2011 exclusion limit strongly impacts on low-mass regions of cMSSM

detection data can rule out regions of high SUSY masses, such as the
Focus-Point region, which is unreachable for the LHC in the near future. We
show that, in addition to XENON100 data, the experimental constraint on the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon plays a dominant role in disfavouring
large scalar and gaugino masses. We find that, should the LHC 2011 excess

memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer
connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a
probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently
store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We
show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low
memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly
graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the
overall memory requirements for {\em de novo} assembly of metagenomes. On one
soil metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in
the maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph
representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs

are a very powerful tool, since their solutions are, in theory, global minima
of the non-constrained subspace. However, this minimization leads to an
incertitude concerning the saddle points, that can sometimes be no more saddle
points in bigger constrained subspaces (fake saddle points), or can be missing
on a trajectory (it missing saddle points). These phenomena are the
consequences of discontinuities of the self-consistent potential energy
surfaces (SPES). These discontinuities may have important consequences, since
they can for example hide the real height of an energy barrier, and avoid any
use of a SPES for further dynamical calculations, barrier penetrability
estimations, or trajectory predictions. Discontinuities are not related to the
quality of the production of a SPES, since even a perfectly converged SPES with
an ideally fine mesh can be discontinuous. In this paper we explain what are
the discontinuities, their consequences, and their origins. We then propose a
numerical method to detect and identify discontinuities on a given SPES, and
finally we discuss what are the best ways to transform a discontinuous SPES

cornerstones of compact object astrophysics. Microlensing surveys may help on
this purpose since the lensing mechanism is independent of the emission
properties of the lens. Indeed, several black hole candidates deriving through
microlensing observations have been reported in the literature. The
identification of counterparts, especially in the X-rays, would be a strong
argument in favor of the compact nature of these lenses.
  We perform a cross-correlation between the catalogs of microlensing events by
the OGLE, MACHO and MOA teams, and those of X-rays sources from XMM-Newton and
Chandra satellites. Based on our previous work, we select only microlensing
events longer than 100 days, which should contain a large fraction of lenses as
compact objects. Our matching criterion takes into account the positional
coincidence in the sky.
  We find a single match between a microlensing event OGLE 2004-BLG-81 and the
X-ray source 2XMM J180540.5-273427. The angular separation is \sim 0.5
arc-seconds, well inside the 90% error box of the X-ray source. The hardness
ratios reported in the 2XMM catalog suggest a hard spectrum with a peak between
2 and 4.5 keV or a softer but highly absorbed source. Moreover the microlensing
event is not fully constrained, and possible association with a flaring CV or a
RS CVn star have been suggested as well.
  The small angular separation is a strong indicator that 2XMM J180540.5-273427
is the X-ray counterpart of the OGLE event. However, the uncertainties on both
the nature of lensed system and the lens itself challenge the interpretation of
2XMM J180540.5-273427 as the first confirmed isolated black hole identified so
far. In any case, it probes the diagnostic capacity of microlensing surveys and
open the path for further identifications of black hole or neutron star
candidates.

modelling of multivariate data. Similarly, Bayesian methods are increasingly
used to obtain efficient likelihood-based inference. However, to date, there
has been only limited use of Bayesian approaches in the formulation and
estimation of copula models. This article aims to address this shortcoming in
two ways. First, to introduce copula models and aspects of copula theory that
are especially relevant for a Bayesian analysis. Second, to outline Bayesian
approaches to formulating and estimating copula models, and their advantages
over alternative methods. Copulas covered include Archimedean, copulas
constructed by inversion, and vine copulas; along with their interpretation as
transformations. A number of parameterisations of a correlation matrix of a
Gaussian copula are considered, along with hierarchical priors that allow for
Bayesian selection and model averaging for each parameterisation. Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling schemes for fitting Gaussian and D-vine copulas, with and
without selection, are given in detail. The relationship between the prior for
the parameters of a D-vine, and the prior for a correlation matrix of a
Gaussian copula, is discussed. Last, it is shown how to compute Bayesian
inference when the data are discrete-valued using data augmentation. This
approach generalises popular Bayesian methods for the estimation of models for
multivariate binary and other ordinal data to more general copula models.
Bayesian data augmentation has substantial advantages over other methods of
estimation for this class of models.

from 7.6 to 755 kpc from the Milky Way. Nonetheless, there are no published
searches for PNe in any of these galaxies to date. Apart from the LMC and Milky
Way, the number of PN discoveries has been very modest and only one additional
LG galaxy has been surveyed for PNe over the past 5 years. This paper provides
the number of Local Group PNe currently known and estimates each galaxy's total

transmitted with help of network coding in ad-hoc network topologies. The
correlated data are encoded independently at sensors and network coding is
employed in the intermediate nodes in order to improve the data delivery
performance. In such settings, we focus on the problem of reconstructing the
sources at decoder when perfect decoding is not possible due to losses or
bandwidth bottlenecks. We first show that the source data similarity can be
used at decoder to permit decoding based on a novel and simple approximate
decoding scheme. We analyze the influence of the network coding parameters and
in particular the size of finite coding fields on the decoding performance. We
further determine the optimal field size that maximizes the expected decoding
performance as a trade-off between information loss incurred by limiting the
resolution of the source data and the error probability in the reconstructed
data. Moreover, we show that the performance of the approximate decoding
improves when the accuracy of the source model increases even with simple
approximate decoding techniques. We provide illustrative examples about the
possible of our algorithms that can be deployed in sensor networks and
distributed imaging applications. In both cases, the experimental results
confirm the validity of our analysis and demonstrate the benefits of our low
complexity solution for delivery of correlated data sources.

compelling nonperturbative approximation to the full light-front QCD
Hamiltonian. This approach, called ""Light-Front Holography"", successfully
describes the spectroscopy of light-quark meson and baryons, their elastic and
transition form factors, and other hadronic properties. The bound-state
Schrodinger and Dirac equations of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model predict linear
Regge trajectories which have the same slope in orbital angular momentum L and
radial quantum number n for both mesons and baryons. Light-front holography
connects the fifth-dimensional coordinate of AdS space z to an invariant impact
separation variable zeta in 3+1 space at fixed light-front time. A key feature
is the determination of the frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of
hadrons -- the relativistic analogs of the Schrodinger wavefunctions of atomic
physics which allow one to compute form factors, transversity distributions,
spin properties of the valence quarks, jet hadronization, and other hadronic
observables. One thus obtains a one-parameter color-confining model for hadron
physics at the amplitude level. AdS/QCD also predicts the form of a
non-perturbative effective running coupling and its beta-function with an
infrared fixed point which agrees with the effective coupling extracted from
measurements of the Bjorken sum rule below 1 GeV^2. This is consistent with a
flux-tube interpretation of QCD where soft gluons are sublimated into a
color-confining potential for quarks. We discuss a number of phenomenological
hadronic properties which support this picture.

disparity have a long history in robust estimation in frequentist inference. We
demonstrate that an equivalent robustification may be made in Bayesian
inference by substituting an appropriately scaled disparity for the log
likelihood to which standard Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods may be applied. A
particularly appealing property of minimum-disparity methods is that while they
yield robustness with a breakdown point of 1/2, the resulting parameter
estimates are also efficient when the posited probabilistic model is correct.
We demonstrate that a similar property holds for disparity-based Bayesian
inference. We further show that in the Bayesian setting, it is also possible to
extend these methods to robustify regression models, random effects
distributions and other hierarchical models. The methods are demonstrated on

This makes it challenging to design an efficient scheduling algorithm, and has
consequently drawn considerable research interest. However, previous results
either cannot provide a 100% throughput guarantee without a speedup, or require
a complex centralized scheduler. In this paper, we design a distributed 100%

limited message passing. We prove that DISQUO can achieve 100% throughput for
any admissible Bernoulli traffic, with a low time complexity of O(1) per port

detailed structural properties such as shape, rotation, substructure and degree
of internal relaxation. Recent non-parametric (principal component) analyses
suggest that a few principal components explain a large fraction of the scatter
in halo properties. The main principal component is closely linked with
concentration, which in turn is known to be related to the mass accretion
history of the halo. Here we examine more generally the connection between mass
accretion history and structural parameters. The space of mass accretion
histories has principal components of its own. We find that the strongest two
can be interpreted as the overall age of the halo and the acceleration or
deceleration of growth at late times. These two components only account for
$\sim70$%\ of the scatter in mass accretions histories however, due to the
stochastic effect of major mergers. Relating structural parameters to formation
history, we find that concentration correlates strongly with the early history
of the halo, while relaxation correlates with the late history. We examine the
inferences about formation history that can be drawn by splitting haloes into
subsamples, based on observable properties such as concentration and shape at
some final time. This approach suggests interesting possibilities, such as the
possibility of defining young and old samples of galaxy clusters in a rigorous,
quantitative way, or testing the dynamical assumptions of galaxy formation

extremely difficult to predict {\it a priori} the MS packing probabilities, or
even which MS packings will be the most versus the least probable. We describe
a novel computational method for calculating the MS packing probabilities by
directly measuring the volume of the MS packing `basin of attraction', which we
define as the collection of initial points in configuration space at {\it zero
packing fraction} that map to a given MS packing by following a particular
dynamics in the density landscape. We show that there is a small core region
with volume $V^c_n$ surrounding each MS packing $n$ in configuration space in
which all initial conditions map to a given MS packing. However, we find that
the MS packing probabilities are very weakly correlated with core volumes.
Instead, MS packing probabilities obtained using initially dilute
configurations are determined by complex geometric features of the basin of
attraction that are distant from the MS packing.

investigates the hardness of precisely checking the quantitative information
flow of a program according to such definitions. More precisely, we study the

a program M and a positive real number q, decide if the quantitative
information flow of M is less than or equal to q. We prove that the bounding
problem is not a k-safety property for any k (even when q is fixed, for the
Shannon-entropy-based definition with the uniform distribution), and therefore
is not amenable to the self-composition technique that has been successfully
applied to checking non-interference. We also prove complexity theoretic
hardness results for the case when the program is restricted to loop-free
boolean programs. Specifically, we show that the problem is PP-hard for all
definitions, showing a gap with non-interference which is coNP-complete for the
same class of programs. The paper also compares the results with the recently

principle component analysis (robust PCA) via minimization a combination of the
nuclear norm and the $\ell_1$-norm is used to extract low-rank features which
are robust to white noise and gross corruption for audio segments. These
low-rank features are fed to a linear classifier where the weight and bias are
learned by solving similar trace norm constrained problems. For this
classifier, most methods find the weight and bias in batch-mode learning, which
makes them inefficient for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose an
online framework using accelerated proximal gradient method. This framework has
a main advantage in memory cost. In addition, as a result of the regularization
formulation of matrix classification, the Lipschitz constant was given

by C-energy argument that it is stable. Recently, the present authors and Ida
reanalyzed this system by evaluating the C-energy on the future null infinity
and found that the system has an instability, though it was not shown how the
system is unstable. In this paper, it is shown in the framework of the linear
perturbation theory that, if the constituent particles move slowly, the static
shell is unstable in the sense that the perturbation of its circumferential
radius oscillates with exponentially growing amplitude, whereas if the speed of
the constituent particle exceeds a critical value, the shell just expands or
contracts exponentially with time.

building of a communication network. Informally, there are $n$ players sitting
on the network nodes, which attempt to establish a reciprocal communication by
activating, incurring a certain cost, any of their incident links. The goal of
each player is to have all the other nodes as close as possible in the
resulting network, while buying as few links as possible. According to this
intuition, any model of the game must then appropriately address a balance
between these two conflicting objectives. Motivated by the fact that a player
might have a strong requirement about its centrality in the network, in this
paper we introduce a new setting in which if a player maintains its (either
maximum or average) distance to the other nodes within a given associated
bound, then its cost is simply equal to the number of activated edges,
otherwise its cost is unbounded. We study the problem of understanding the
structure of associated pure Nash equilibria of the resulting games, that we
call MaxBD and SumBD, respectively. For both games, we show that computing the
best response of a player is an NP-hard problem. Next, we show that when
distance bounds associated with players are non-uniform, then equilibria can be
arbitrarily bad. On the other hand, for MaxBD, we show that when nodes have a
uniform bound $R$ on the maximum distance, then the Price of Anarchy (PoA) is
lower and upper bounded by 2 and $O(n^{\frac{1}{\lfloor\log_3 R\rfloor+1}})$
for $R \geq 3$, while for the interesting case R=2, we are able to prove that
the PoA is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$. For the uniform SumBD
we obtain similar (asymptotically) results, and moreover we show that the PoA
becomes constant as soon as the bound on the average distance is
$n^{\omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log n}})}$.

spherical collapse model to investigate dark energy perturbations associated
with the formation of dark matter halos. The realistic mass accretion history
of a dark matter halo taking into account its fast and slow growth is
considered by imposing suitable initial conditions and isotropized
virializations for the spherical collapse process. The dark energy component is
treated as a perfect fluid described by two important parameters, the equation
of state parameter $w$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Quintessence models with
$w>-1$ are analyzed. We adopt the Newtonian gauge to describe the spacetime
which is perturbed mainly by the formation of a dark matter halo. It is found
that the dark energy density perturbation $\delta_{DE}$ depends on $w$ and
$c_s$, and its behavior follows closely the gravitational potential $\Phi$ of
the dark matter halo with $\delta_{DE}\approx -(1+w)\Phi/c_s^2$. For $w>-1$,
the dark energy perturbation presents a clustering behavior with
$\delta_{DE}>0$ during the entire formation of the dark matter halo, from
linear to nonlinear and virialized stages. The value of $\delta_{DE}$ increases
with the increase of the halo mass. For a cluster of mass $M\sim 10^{15}
M_{\odot}$, $\delta_{DE}\sim 10^{-5}$ within the virialized region for $c_s^2
\in [0.5, 1]$, and it can reach $\delta_{DE}=O(1)$ with $c_s^2=0.00001$. For a
scalar-field dark energy model, we find that with suitably modeled $w$ and
$c_s$, its perturbation behavior associated with the nonlinear formation of
dark matter halos can well be analyzed using the fluid approach, demonstrating
the validity of the fluid description for dark energy even considering its
perturbation in the stage of nonlinear dark matter structure formation.

semiamplitude of 6.1\,s, while it undergoes a downward parabolic change
(revealing a period decrease at a rate of $\dot{P}=-9.2\times{10^{-12}}$). The
periodic variation was analyzed for the light-travel time effect via the
presence of a third body. The mass of the tertiary companion was determined to
be $M_3\sin{i^{\prime}}=2.3(\pm0.3)$\,$M_{Jupiter}$ when a total mass of

by true angular momentum loss caused by gravitational radiation or/and magnetic
braking, the observed downward parabolic change in the O-C diagram may be only
a part of a long-period (longer than 15 years) cyclic variation, which may

dissipation rate, we identify a first order dynamical phase transition between
active and inactive {\em dynamical phases}. We demonstrate that dynamical
phase-coexistence becomes manifest in an intermittent behavior of the bath
quanta emission. Moreover, we establish the connection between the dynamical
order parameter that quantifies the activity, and the longitudinal
magnetization that serves as static order parameter. The system we consider can
be implemented in current experiments with Rydberg atoms and trapped ions.

individual quantum emitters under external laser excitation. We show that both
types of correlations, the former measured by the quantum discord, are present
in the system's evolution even though the emitters may exhibit an early stage
disentanglement. In the absence of external laser pumping,we demonstrate
analytically, for a set of suitable initial states, that there is an entropy
bound for which quantum discord and entanglement of the emitters are always
greater than classical correlations, thus disproving an early conjecture that
classical correlations are greater than quantum correlations. Furthermore, we
show that quantum correlations can also be greater than classical correlations
when the system is driven by a laser field. For scenarios where the emitters'
quantum correlations are below their classical counterparts, an optimization of
the evolution of the quantum correlations can be carried out by appropriately
tailoring the amplitude of the laser field and the emitters' dipole-dipole
interaction. We stress the importance of using the entanglement of formation,
rather than the concurrence, as the entanglement measure, since the latter can
grow beyond the total correlations and thus give incorrect results on the
actual system's degree of entanglement.

relation to stellar rotation is not yet well understood. We investigate the
relation between the X-ray activity, rotation, and Rossby number for a sample
of 82 young stars in the ~3 Myr old cluster IC 348. We use the data of four
Chandra observations of IC 348 to derive the X-ray luminosities of the young
stars. The young stars in IC 348 show no correlation between X-ray activity and
rotation period. Considering the Rossby numbers, nearly all IC 348 stars are in
the saturated regime of the activity-rotation relation defined by main-sequence
stars. Searching for possible super-saturation effects, we find a marginal (but
statistically in-significant) trend that the stars with the smallest Rossby
numbers show slightly lower X-ray activity levels. We compare the dispersion of
fractional X-ray luminosities of the stars in the saturated rotation regime in
IC 348 to that seen in younger and older stellar populations. The scatter seen
in the ~3 Myr old IC 348 is considerably smaller than for the ~1 Myr old ONC,
but, at the same time, considerably larger than the dispersion seen in the ~30
Myr old cluster NGC 2547 and in main-sequence stars. The results of our X-ray
analysis of IC 348 show that neither the rotation rates nor the
presence/absence of circumstellar disks are of fundamental importance for
determining the level of X-ray activity in TTS. Our results suggest that the
scatter of X-ray activity levels shown by the fast-rotating members of young
clusters decreases with the age of the stellar population. We interpret this as
a signature of the changing interior structure of PMS stars and the consequent
changes in the dynamo mechanisms that are responsible for the magnetic field
generation.

bits of (real) algebraic numbers. This extends the work of Yap on computing the
bits of transcendental numbers like \pi, in Logspace.
  Our main result is that computing a bit of a fixed real algebraic number is
in C=NC1\subseteq Logspace when the bit position has a verbose (unary)
representation and in the counting hierarchy when it has a succinct (binary)
representation.
  Our tools are drawn from elementary analysis and numerical analysis, and
include the Newton-Raphson method. The proof of our main result is entirely
elementary, preferring to use the elementary Liouville's theorem over the much
deeper Roth's theorem for algebraic numbers.
  We leave the possibility of proving non-trivial lower bounds for the problem
of computing the bits of an algebraic number given the bit position in binary,
as our main open question. In this direction we show very limited progress by
proving a lower bound for rationals.

equation on a bounded interval discretized in space using the quadratic
classical finite element approximation. A careful Fourier analysis of the
discrete wave dynamics reveals two different branches in the spectrum: the
acoustic one, of physical nature, and the optic one, related to the
perturbations that this second-order finite element approximation introduces
with respect to the linear one. On both modes there are high frequencies with
vanishing group velocity as the mesh size tends to zero. This shows that the
classical property of continuous waves of being observable from the boundary
fails to be uniform for this discretization scheme. As a consequence of this,
the controls of the discrete waves may blow-up as the mesh size tends to zero.
To remedy these high frequency pathologies, we design filtering mechanisms
based on a bi-grid algorithm for which one can recover the uniformity of the
observability constant in a finite time and, consequently, the possibility to
control with uniformly bounded $L^2$ - controls appropriate projections of the
solutions. This also allows showing that, by relaxing the control requirement,
the controls are uniformly bounded and converge to the continuous ones as the
mesh size tends to zero.

theoretical framework that allows description and reproduction of Dynamic

under ramps of surface tension is described as a combination of initial pore
formation followed by Brownian process of the pore radius crossing the
time-dependent energy barrier. We present the formalism and derive (formal)
analytical expression of the survival probability describing the fate of the
membrane under DTS conditions. Using numerical simulations for the membrane
prepared in an initial state with a given distribution of times for pore
nucleation, we have studied the membrane lifetime (or inverse of rupture rate)
and distribution of membrane surface tension at rupture as a function of
membrane characteristics like pore nucleation rate, the energy barrier to
failure and tension loading rate. It is found that simulations reproduce main
features of the experimental data, particularly, the pore nucleation and pore
size diffusion controlled limits of membrane rupture dynamics. This approach
can also be applied to processes of permeation and pore opening in membranes

dimensional (2D) topological insulators evolves with increasing
electron-electron correlation engendered by a Hubbard like on-site repulsion
$U$ in finite ribbons of two models of topological band insulators. Using an
inhomogeneous cluster slave rotor mean-field method developed here, we show
that electronic correlations drive the topologically nontrivial phase into a
Mott insulating phase via two different routes. In a synchronous transition,
the entire ribbon attains a Mott insulating state at one critical $U$ that
depends weakly on the width of the ribbon. In the second, asynchronous route,
Mott localization first occurs on the edge layers at a smaller critical value
of electronic interaction which then propagates into the bulk as $U$ is further
increased until all layers of the ribbon become Mott localized. We show that
the kind of Mott transition that takes place is determined by certain

timings of interaction events can be crucial in determining how some dynamic
process mediated by the network unfolds. We have explored the limiting case of
the speed of spreading in the SI model, set up such that an event between an
infectious and susceptible individual always transmits the infection. The speed
of this process sets an upper bound for the speed of any dynamic process that
is mediated through the interaction events of the network. With the help of
temporal networks derived from large scale time-stamped data on mobile phone
calls, we extend earlier results that point out the slowing-down effects of
burstiness and temporal inhomogeneities. In such networks, links are not
permanently active, but dynamic processes are mediated by recurrent events
taking place on the links at specific points in time. We perform a multi-scale
analysis and pinpoint the importance of the timings of event sequences on
individual links, their correlations with neighboring sequences, and the
temporal pathways taken by the network-scale spreading process. This is
achieved by studying empirically and analytically different characteristic
relay times of links, relevant to the respective scales, and a set of temporal
reference models that allow for removing selected time-domain correlations one
by one.

subduction coefficients relating the standard Young-Yamanouchi basis for the

Schur-Weyl duality. We have also directly obtained matrix representations in
the split basis using these techniques. The advantages of this approach are
that we obtain analytical expressions for the subduction coefficients and
matrix representations and directly resolve issues of multiplicity in the
subduction of $S_{n} \times S_{m}$ irreducible representations from $S_{n+m}$
irreducible representations. Our method is applicable to $S_{n+m}$ irreducible
representations labelled by Young diagrams with large row length differences.
We provide evidence for a systematic expansion in the inverse row length
difference and tools to compute the leading contribution, which is exact when

The basis of the algorithm is the insight that previous approaches used fairly
narrow definitions of interestingness / non interestingness. We argue that
allowing these definitions to depend on the problem / data at hand is a more
natural approach in an exploratory technique. This also allows our technique
much greater applicability than the approaches extant in the literature.
Complementing this insight, we propose a class of projection indices based on
the spatial distribution function that can make use of such information.
  Finally, with the help of real datasets, we demonstrate how a range of
multivariate exploratory tasks can be addressed with our algorithm. The
examples further demonstrate that the proposed indices are quite capable of
focussing on the interesting structure in the data, even when this structure is
otherwise hard to detect or arises from very subtle patterns.

Galaxy, making it one of the most massive clusters for which we can resolve the
individual stars even in the crowded centre. This makes it an ideal target to
assess whether massive clusters formed currently will remain bound or will
disperse and contribute significantly to the stellar field population. Aims.
Here we report a measurement of the radial velocity dispersion of Westerlund I
to explore whether the cluster is currently in virial equilibrium, if it is in
the process of collapse or if it is expanding and dispersing into the field.
Methods. We obtained MIKE/Magellan high resolution optical spectra of 22 post
main-sequence stars jn Westerlund I for 2 or 3 epochs with a maximum baseline
of about one year. Radial velocities variations between these spectra have been
measured through cross correlation. Results. We calculate the velocity
dispersion from the cross correlation of five yellow hypergiants and one
luminous blue variable, that show little radial velocity variations between
epochs and have many spectral features in common. After taking into account the
effect of small number statistics and undetected binaries, we estimate the
velocity dispersion for the massive stars in Westerlund I to be 2.1 (+3.3,
-2.1) km s-1. For several different assumptions concerning possible mass
segregation and the elongation of the cluster, we find that Westerlund I is
subvirial at the 90% confidence level. Conclusions. We can rule out that the
cluster is significantly supervirial at the 97% confidence level, indicating
that Westerlund I is currently bound. This implies that Westerlund I has
survived past the point where any gas expulsion has taken place and is expected
to survive for billions of years.

These flux PDFs are constructed in 3D as well as in projection (i.e. in 2D).
The PDFs are constructed by relating the lower-order moments, i.e. cumulants
and cumulant correlators, of the fluxes to the 3D neutral hydrogen distribution
which is, in turn, expressed as a function of the underlying dark matter
distribution. The lower-order moments are next modelled using a generating
function formalism in the context of a {\em minimal tree-model} for the
higher-order correlation hierarchy. These different approximations give nearly
identical results for the range of redshifts probed, and we also find a very
good agreement between our predictions and outputs of hydrodynamical

flux-decrements concerning two lines of sight can be extended to multiple lines
of sight, which could be particularly important for the 3D reconstruction of
the cosmic web from QSO spectra (e.g. in the BOSS survey). These statistics
probe the underlying projected neutral hydrogen field and are thus linked to

a flat-space general relativistic (GR) limit and also possess a stable de

Euclidean signature spacetime and is understood as an approximation to the
quantum effective action (generating functional of one-particle irreducible
diagrams) originating from fundamental quantum gravity theory. Using the known
relation between the Schwinger-Keldysh technique for quantum expectation values
and the Euclidean quantum field theory we derive from this action the {\em
causal} effective equations of motion for mean value of the metric field in the
physical Lorentzian-signature spacetime. Thus we show that the (A)dS background
of the theory carries as free propagating modes massless gravitons having two
polarizations identical to those of the Einstein theory with a cosmological
term. The on-shell action of the theory is vanishing both for the flat-space
and (A)dS backgrounds which play the role of stable vacua underlying
respectively the ultraviolet and infrared phases of the theory. We also obtain
linearized gravitational potentials of compact matter sources and show that in
the infrared (A)dS phase their effective gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$
can be essentially different from the Newton gravitational constant $G_N$ of
the short-distance GR phase. When $G_{\rm eff}\gg G_N$ the (A)dS phase can be
regarded as a strongly coupled infrared modification of Einstein theory not
only describing the dark energy mechanism of cosmic acceleration but also
simulating the dark matter phenomenon by enhanced gravitational attraction at

is to generalize the problem to the framework of general
polymerization-fragmentation under flow motion, motivated by the fact that
laboratory work often involves prion dynamics under flow conditions in order to
observe faster processes. Moreover, understanding and modelling the
microstructure influence of macroscopically monitored non-Newtonian behaviour
is crucial for sensor design, with the goal to provide practical information
about ongoing molecular evolution. This paper's results can then be considered
as one step in the mathematical understanding of such models, namely the proof
of positivity and existence of solutions in suitable functional spaces. To that
purpose, we introduce a new model based on the rigid-rod polymer theory to
account for the polymer dynamics under flow conditions. As expected, when
applied to the prion problem, in the absence of motion it reduces to that in
Greer et al. (2006). At the heart of any polymer kinetical theory there is a
configurational probability diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) of
Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski type. The main mathematical result of this paper is
the proof of existence of positive solutions to the aforementioned PDE for a

epitaxial graphene films formed on the Si-face of semi-insulating 4H-SiC
substrates by a high temperature sublimation process. A high-k top-gate on the
epitaxial graphene is realized by inserting a fully oxidized nanometer thin
aluminum film as a seeding layer, followed by an atomic layer deposition
process. At low temperatures, the devices demonstrate a strong field effect by
the top gate with an on/off ratio of ~7 and an electron mobility up to ~3250
cm^2/Vs. After the observation of the half-integer quantum Hall effect for
monolayer epitaxial graphene films, detailed magneto-transport measurements
have been carried out including varying densities, temperatures, magnetic
fields and currents. We study the width of the distinguishable quantum-Hall
plateau to plateau transition (Landau level index n=0 to n=1) as temperature
(T) and current are varied. For both gate voltage and magnetic field sweeps and
T>10 K the transition width goes as T^{-\kappa} with exponent \kappa ~0.42.
This universal scaling exponent agrees well with those found in III-V
heterojunctions with short range alloy disorders and in exfoliated graphene.

  1757-1771",,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is a classical result that dyadic partial sums of the Fourier series of
functions $f \in L^p(\mathbb{T})$ converge almost everywhere for $p \in (1,
\infty)$. In 1968, E. A. Bredihina established an analogous result for
functions belonging to the Stepanov space of almost periodic functions $S^2$
whose Fourier exponents satisfy a natural separation condition. Here, the
maximal operator corresponding to dyadic partial summation of almost periodic
Fourier series is bounded on the Stepanov spaces $S^{2^k}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$
for functions satisfying the same condition; Bredihina's result follows as a
consequence. In the process of establishing these bounds, some general results
are obtained which will facilitate further work on operator bounds and
convergence issues in Stepanov spaces. These include a boundedness theorem for
the Hilbert transform and a theorem of Littlewood--Paley type. An improvement
of ""$S^{2^k}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$"" to ""$S^p$, $p \in (1, \infty)$"" is also seen
to follow from a natural conjecture on the boundedness of the Hilbert
transform.

plotted in a diagram with their bolometric fluence (Sbolo) versus the observed
photon energy of peak spectral flux (Epeak,obs). In this diagram, bursts that
obey the Amati relation must lie above some limiting line, although
observational scatter is expected to be substantial. We confirm that early
bursts with spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with this limit. But, we
find that the bursts from BATSE, Swift, Suzaku, and Konus are all greatly in
violation of the limit. In the Sbolo-Epeak,obs diagram, we find that every
satellite has a greatly different distribution. This requires that selection
effects are dominating these distributions, which we identify. For detector
selections, the trigger threshold and the threshold to measure Epeak,obs
combine to make a diagonal cutoff with the position of this cutoff varying
greatly detector to detector. For selection effects due to the intrinsic
properties of the burst population, the distribution of Epeak,obs makes for
bursts with low and high values to be rare, while the fluence distribution
makes bright bursts uncommon. For a poor threshold, the combination of
selection effects serves to allow only bursts within a region along the limit
to be measured; these bursts will then appear to follow an Amati relation.
Therefore, the Amati relation is an artifact of selection effects within the
burst population and the detector. Therefore, the Amati relation should not be
used for cosmological tasks. This failure is in no way prejudicial against the
other luminosity relations.

on XMM-Newton-RGS data, but using complementary data from XMM-Epic, Integral,
and Chandra-HETG, to investigate different aspects of the source. The broad
band continuum is well fitted by a classical combination of black body and
Comptonized emission. The continuum shape and the high flux of the source
(L/L_Edd\sim0.16) are consistent with a ""high state"" of the source. We do not
find significant evidence of iron emission at energies >=6.4 keV. The soft
X-ray spectrum contain a number of absorption features. Here we focus on the
cold-mildly ionized gas. The neutral gas column density is N_H\sim1.63x10^21
cm^-2. The detailed study of the oxygen and iron edge reveals that those
elements are depleted, defined here as the ratio between dust and the total ISM
cold phase, by a factor 0.20\pm0.02 and 0.87\pm0.14, respectively. Using the
available dust models, the best fit points to a major contribution of Mg-rich
silicates, with metallic iron inclusion. Although we find that a large fraction
of Fe is in dust form, the fit shows that Fe-rich silicates are disfavored. The
measured Mg:Fe ratio is 2.0\pm0.3. Interestingly, this modeling may point to a
well studied dust constituent (GEMS), sometimes proposed as a silicate
constituent in our Galaxy. Oxygen and iron are found to be slightly over- and
under-abundant, respectively (1.23 and 0.85 times the solar value) along this
line of sight. We also report the detection of two absorption lines,
tentatively identified as part of an outflow of mildly ionized gas
(\xi\sim-0.5) at a velocity of \sim1200 km/s.

association with a $W$ boson using events recorded by the CDF experiment in a
dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.6 fb-1. The search is
performed using a matrix element technique in which the signal and background
hypotheses are used to create a powerful discriminator. The discriminant output
distributions for signal and background are fit to the observed events using a
binned likelihood approach to search for the Higgs boson signal. We find no
evidence for a Higgs boson, and 95% confidence level (C.L.) upper limits are
set on the Higgs boson production rate. The observed limits range from 3.5 to
37.6 relative to the standard model expectation for Higgs boson masses between
100 and 150 GeV. The 95% C.L. expected limit is estimated from the median of an
ensemble of simulated experiments and varies between 2.9 and 32.7 relative to
the production rate predicted by the standard model over the Higgs boson mass
range studied.

by viewing the Feynman integral as a period of a variation of a mixed Hodge

squared. The fibre is the complement of an elliptic curve. From the fact that
the first cohomology group of this elliptic curve is two-dimensional we obtain
a second-order differential equation. This is an improvement compared to the
usual way of deriving differential equations: Integration-by-parts identities
lead only to a coupled system of four first-order differential equations.

insulator to metal (IM) transition was studied using X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) supported by ab initio calculations. The monotonic
contraction of the NiO6 units under applied pressure observed up to 13 GPa,
stops in a limited pressure domain around 14 GPa, before resuming above 16 GPa.
In this narrow pressure range, crystallographic modifications basically occur
in the medium/long range, not in the NiO6 octahedron, whereas the evolution of
the near-edge XAS features can be associated to metallization. Ab initio
calculations show that these features are related to medium range order,
provided that the Ni-O-Ni angle enables a proper overlap of the Ni eg and O 2p
orbitals. Metallization is then not directly related to modifications in the
average local geometry of the NiO6 units but more likely to an inter-octahedra
rearrangement. These outcomes provides evidences of the bandwidth driven nature
of the IM transition.

by N.S.M.B., predicts at the low energy regime two (in the mixing matrix
elements decoupled) groups of four families. There are two kinds of
contributions to mass matrices in this theory. One kind distinguishes on the
tree level only among the members of one family, that is among the $u$-quark,
$d$-quark, neutrino and electron, the left and right handed, while the other
kind distinguishes only among the families. Mass matrices for $d$-quarks and
electrons are on the tree level correspondingly strongly correlated and so are
mass matrices for $u$-quarks and neutrinos, up to the term, the Majorana term,
which is nonzero only for right handed neutrinos. Beyond the tree level both
kinds of contributions start to contribute coherently and it is expected that a
detailed study of properties of mass matrices beyond the tree level explains
drastic differences in masses and mixing matrices between quarks and leptons.
We report in this paper on analysis of one loop corrections to the tree level
fermion masses and mixing matrices. Loop diagrams are mediated by the gauge
bosons and the two kinds of scalar fields. A detailed numerical analysis of
fermion masses and mixing, including neutrinos, within this scenario is in
progress and preparation.
