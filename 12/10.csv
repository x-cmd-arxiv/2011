hard, heuristic clustering algorithms are used in practice, or other approaches

comprehensive experimental evaluation of the qualitative behavior of greedy
bottom-up heuristics driven by cut-based objectives and constrained by
intracluster density, using both real-world data and artificial instances. Our
study documents that a greedy strategy based on local movement is superior to
one based on merging. We further reveal that the former approach generally
outperforms alternative setups and reference algorithms from the literature in
terms of its own objective, while a modularity-based algorithm competes
surprisingly well. Finally, we exhibit which combinations of cut-based inter-

is one of the most important factors in strategic decisions, including

this article and the algorithm described are based on the idea of a information
theoretic basis of decision in strategy games . The model generalizes and
provides a mathematical justification for one of the most popular search
algorithms used in leading computer chess programs, the fractional ply scheme.
However, despite its success in leading computer chess applications, until now
few has been published about this method. The article creates a fundamental
basis for this method in the axioms of information theory, then derives the
principles used in programming the search and describes mathematically the form
of the coefficients. One of the most important parameters of the fractional ply
search is derived from fundamental principles. Until now this coefficient has
been usually handcrafted or determined from intuitive elements or data mining.
There is a deep, information theoretical justification for such a parameter. In
one way the method proposed is a generalization of previous methods. More
important, it shows why the fractional depth ply scheme is so powerful. It is
because the algorithm navigates along the lines where the highest information
gain is possible. A working and original implementation has been written and
tested for this algorithm and is provided in the appendix. The article is
essentially self-contained and gives proper background knowledge and
references. The assumptions are intuitive and in the direction expected and
described intuitively by great champions of chess.

different from asymptotically AdS settings where one is allowed to choose an

We perform this analysis in the covariant phase space approach as well as in
the holographic renormalization approach. We show that all choices for \omega

the leading order boundary stress tensor are insensitive to the

depends on the supertranslation frame but only in a way that the transformation

Mann-Levy (GML) model with partially conserved axial-vector currents (PCAC),
tadpole renormalization (a Higgs Vacuum Stability Condition) forces all
S-matrix ultra-violet quadratic divergences (UVQD) to be absorbed into the
physical renormalized pseudo-scalar pion (pole) mass squared. We show that this
includes ""new"" UVQD (widely unfamiliar to modern audiences). We also show that
tadpole renormalization is an automatic consequence of Ward-Takahashi
identities.
  We prove that all UVQD therefore vanish identically in the Goldstone-mode
limit, where pions are Nambu-Goldstone Bosons (NGB), and where Lee and
Symanzik's Goldstone Symmetry Restoration Condition (a renormalization
prescription) enforces spontaneous symmetry breaking and the massless-ness of
NGB. Axial-vector current conservation is restored as is SU(2)(L-R) chiral
symmetry: the vanishing of UVQD is therefore achieved in the Goldstone-mode by
restoration of an exact symmetry, and therefore (by definition) without
fine-tuning!
  A weak-scale Higgs mass is therefore not UVQD fine-tuned in the spontaneously
broken GML LSM. That is simply another (albeit unfamiliar) consequence of the
Goldstone Theorem. Hence Goldstone-mode O(4) LSM symmetries are sufficient to
ensure that the theory does not suffer from the Higgs Fine Tuning Problem. This
is contrary to the widely accepted belief that UVQD in the Higgs mass lead to
such problems in the O(4) LSM, which are then presumed to be inherited by the
Standard Model (SM). The key observation is to regard the spontaneously broken
O(4) LSM as the Goldstone-mode limit of the GML LSM.
  We prove this first at 1-loop then at all loop orders for the pure scalar GML
model. We then break the O(4) symmetry to SU(2)L with SM Yukawa couplings, and
show that the above remains true.

particular its cosmic censorship conjecture and no-hair theorem for rotating
black holes. These experiments can be performed by timing observations with 100
micro-second precision, achievable with the Square Kilometre Array for a normal
pulsar at frequency above 15 GHz. Based on the standard pulsar timing
technique, we develop a method that allows the determination of the mass, spin,
and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*, and provides a consistent covariance analysis
of the measurement errors. Furthermore, we test this method in detailed mock
data simulations. It seems likely that only for orbital periods below ~0.3 yr
is there the possibility of having negligible external perturbations. For such
orbits we expect a ~10^-3 test of the frame dragging and a ~10^-2 test of the
no-hair theorem within 5 years, if Sgr A* is spinning rapidly. Our method is
also capable of identifying perturbations caused by distributed mass around Sgr
A*, thus providing high confidence in these gravity tests. Our analysis is not
affected by uncertainties in our knowledge of the distance to the Galactic
center, R0. A combination of pulsar timing with the astrometric results of
stellar orbits would greatly improve the measurement precision of R0.

The Higgs sector of the model has two doublets and neutral singlets. The mirror
model can be tested at the LHC energies in several aspects. Two very
distinctive signatures of the mirror model are a new neutral gauge boson
$Z^{\prime}$, with a high invisible branching ratio, and a heavy Majorana
neutrino production through the decay $Z^{\prime} \rightarrow N +\bar \nu$.
This result is compared with heavy Majorana production through heavy pair
production and the consequent same-sign dilepton production. The other
important consequence of the mirror model is the prediction of the Higgs mass.
A particular solution leads to a Higgs in the same region as in the standard
model. There is, however, another natural solution where the Higgs mass is

of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 4449 by Karachentsev et al. We map and
analyze this feature using a unique combination of deep integrated-light images
from the Black Bird 0.5-meter telescope, and high-resolution wide-field images
from the 8-meter Subaru telescope, which resolve the nebulosity into a stream
of red giant branch stars, and confirm its physical association with NGC 4449.
The properties of the stream imply a massive dwarf spheroidal progenitor, which
after complete disruption will deposit an amount of stellar mass that is
comparable to the existing stellar halo of the main galaxy. The ratio between
luminosity or stellar-mass between the two galaxies is ~1:50, while the
indirectly measured dynamical mass-ratio, when including dark matter, may be
~1:10-1:5. This system may thus represent a ""stealth"" merger, where an
infalling satellite galaxy is nearly undetectable by conventional means, yet
has a substantial dynamical influence on its host galaxy. This singular
discovery also suggests that satellite accretion can play a significant role in
building up the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies, and possibly in triggering
their starbursts.

unknown duration, due to mobility of mobile clients, is the most important
challenges for concurrency control in mobile database with client-server model.
Applying pessimistic common classic methods of concurrency control (like 2pl)
in mobile database leads to long duration blocking and increasing waiting time
of transactions. Because of high rate of aborting transactions, optimistic
methods aren`t appropriate in mobile database. In this article, OPCOT
concurrency control algorithm is introduced based on optimistic concurrency
control method. Reducing communications between mobile client and server,
decreasing blocking rate and deadlock of transactions, and increasing
concurrency degree are the most important motivation of using optimistic method
as the basis method of OPCOT algorithm. To reduce abortion rate of
transactions, in execution time of transactions` operators a timestamp is
assigned to them. In other to checking commitment ordering property of
scheduler, the assigned timestamp is used in server on time of commitment. In
this article, serializability of OPCOT algorithm scheduler has been proved by
using serializability graph. Results of evaluating simulation show that OPCOT
algorithm decreases abortion rate and waiting time of transactions in compare
to 2pl and optimistic algorithms.

admissibility of the recovered solution; (2) the ability of the recovered
solution to represent the singular solution; on the accuracy, local and global
effectivity of recovery-based error estimators for enriched finite element
methods (e.g. the extended finite element method, XFEM).
Design/methodology/approach: We study the performance of two recovery
techniques. The first is a recently developed superconvergent patch recovery
procedure with equilibration and enrichment (SPR-CX). The second is known as
the extended moving least squares recovery (XMLS), which enriches the recovered
solutions but does not enforce equilibrium constraints. Both are extended
recovery techniques as the polynomial basis used in the recovery process is
enriched with singular terms for a better description of the singular nature of
the solution. Findings: Numerical results comparing the convergence and the
effectivity index of both techniques with those obtained without the enrichment
enhancement clearly show the need for the use of extended recovery techniques
in Zienkiewicz-Zhu type error estimators for this class of problems. The
results also reveal significant improvements in the effectivities yielded by
statically admissible recovered solutions. Originality/value: This work shows
that both extended recovery procedures and statical admissibility are key to an
accurate assessment of the quality of enriched finite element approximations.

then analyze the size distribution and related statistics obtained from the
model. Our ultimate goal is to reproduce the well known statistical features
obtained from the panel study of the firms i.e., the power law in size (in
terms of income and/or employment), the Laplace distribution in the growth
rates and the slowly declining standard deviation of the growth rates
conditional on the firm size. First, we show that the model generalizes the
usual kinetic exchange models with binary interaction to interactions between
an arbitrary number of agents. When the number of interacting agents is in the
order of the system itself, it is possible to decouple the model. We provide
some exact results on the distributions. Our model easily reproduces the power
law. The fluctuations in the growth rate falls with increasing size following a
power law (with an exponent 1 whereas the data suggests that the exponent is
around 1/6). However, the distribution of the difference of the firm-size in
this model has Laplace distribution whereas the real data suggests that the

al. (2009) who showed that the median problem is solvable in polynomial time in
the multichromosomal circular and mixed breakpoint models. This is intriguing,
since in most other rearrangement models (DCJ, reversal, unichromosomal or
multilinear breakpoint models), the problem is NP-hard. The complexity of the
small or even the large phylogeny problem under the breakpoint distance
remained an open problem. We improve the algorithm for the median problem and
show that it is equivalent to the problem of finding maximum cardinality
non-bipartite matching (under linear reduction). On the other hand, we prove
that the more general small phylogeny problem is NP-hard. Surprisingly, we show
that it is already NP-hard (or even APX-hard) for 4 species (a quartet
phylogeny). In other words, while finding an ancestor for 3 species is easy,
finding two ancestors for 4 species is already hard. We also show that, in the
unichromosomal and the multilinear breakpoint model, the halving problem is
NP-hard, thus refuting the conjecture of Tannier et al. Interestingly, this is
the first problem which is harder in the breakpoint model than in the DCJ or

describe the evolution of the stellar populations in the galaxy, the evolution

the propagation of the galactic wind, and the metal-enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we study the properties of the
model, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the
efficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a
given star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star
formation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*
is sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the
ISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and
stellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material
ejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies
are the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor
role in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy
input is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly
to the chemical composition of the galactic wind. We conclude that the history
of the ISM enrichment plays a determinant role in the chemical composition and
extent of the galactic wind, and therefore its ability to enrich the IGM.

taking advantages of other agents' experiences through learning, or make
decisions earlier to avoid competitions from huge crowds. Both these two
effects, social learning and negative network externality, play important roles
in the decision process of an agent. While there are existing works on either
social learning or negative network externality, a general study on considering
both these two contradictory effects is still limited. We find that the Chinese
restaurant process, a popular random process, provides a well-defined structure
to model the decision process of an agent under these two effects. By
introducing the strategic behavior into the non-strategic Chinese restaurant
process, in Part I of this two-part paper, we propose a new game, called

eigenstates. For the fermion ""ground state"" (N=1 Laughlin state), this makes it
possible to exactly calculate its energy all the way up to the mesoscopic
regime N ~ 1000. It is also shown that for N = 3 and Coulomb interaction,
several rational low-lying values of energy exist, for bosons and fermions

brightness). Its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in that
it exceeded the Eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. Because it is only 2.3

mass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, Eta Car
ejected more than 10 M_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of a

are blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansion

first paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in NGC 6530, the
young cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog of
infrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, and
X-ray luminosities. The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly
uniform for 0.5 < P < 10 d; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We
observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that
stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray
luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level
($\log L_X / L_{\rm bol} \approx -3.3$). However, we find a significant
positive correlation between $L_X / L_{\rm bol}$ and co-rotation radius,
suggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal
stripping of the stellar coronae. The period-mass relationship in NGC 6530 is
broadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), but the slope of the
relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the ONC and other
young clusters. We show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for the
slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we
argue that NGC 6530 may be slightly younger than the ONC, making it a
particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in
young, low-mass stars.

symmetry-preserving treatment of a contact-interaction. Obtained thereby, the
e.m. interactions of baryons are typically described by hard form factors. In
contrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent
interaction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering
and resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of
QCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the
ratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of
the dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are
important. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac
form factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we
show via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's
diquark content. The contact interaction produces a first excitation of the
nucleon that is constituted predominantly from axial-vector diquark
correlations. This impacts greatly on the gamma*p->P_{11}(1440) form factors.
Notably, our quark core contribution to F_2*(Q^2) exhibits a zero at
Q^2~0.5mN^2. Faddeev equation treatments of a hadron's quark core usually
underestimate its magnetic properties, hence we consider the effect produced by
a dressed-quark anomalous e.m. moment. Its inclusion much improves agreement
with experiment. On the domain 0<Q^2<2GeV^2, meson-cloud effects are important
in making a realistic comparison between experiment and hadron structure
calculations. Our computed helicity amplitudes are similar to the bare
amplitudes in coupled-channels analyses of the electroproduction process. Thus
supports a view that extant structure calculations should directly be compared
with the bare-couplings, etc., determined via coupled-channels analyses.

the three galaxies (z_reion = 10.5^{+1.0}_{-0.9}) agrees remarkably well with
the latest WMAP constraint on z_reion for a simple instantaneous reionization
model. More importantly, the range of z_reion values found here are consistent
with the global range of z_reion estimates from other observations. We
furthermore find a 1.7{\sigma} indication that reionization completed in
low-density environments before the intergalactic medium in high-density
environments was reionized. This is consistent with certain theoretical models
that predict that reionization was globally prolonged in duration, with neutral
hydrogen pockets surviving in high-density environments, even after the
surrounding regions were reionized. More generally, this work provides a useful
constraint on the formation history of galaxy stellar halos.

the solar vicinity, making it ideal for comparison with local volume-limited

the various observational biases introduced by the SEGUE target selection
strategy. The SEGUE sample is particularly notable for K dwarfs, which are too
faint to examine spectroscopically far from the solar neighborhood. The MDF of
both spectral types becomes more metal-poor with increasing |Z|, which reflects
the transition from a sample with small [alpha/Fe] values at small heights to
one with enhanced [alpha/Fe] above 1 kpc. Comparison of our SEGUE distributions

angular momentum and quiet recent assembly history, whereas spheroids are the
slowly-rotating remnants of repeated merging events. We explore these
assumptions using one hundred systems with halo masses similar to that of the
Milky Way, identified in a series of cosmological gasdynamical simulations
GIMIC. At z=0, the simulated galaxies exhibit a wide variety of morphologies,
from dispersion-dominated spheroids to pure disk galaxies. Surprisingly, these
morphological features are very poorly correlated with their halo properties:
disks form in halos with high and low net spin, and mergers play a negligible
role in the formation of spheroid stars, most of which form in-situ. More
important to morphology is the coherent alignment of the angular momentum of
baryons that accrete over time to form a galaxy. Spheroids tend to form when
the spin of newly-accreted gas is misaligned with that of the extant galaxy,
leading to the episodic formation of stars with different kinematics that
cancel out the net rotation of the system. Disks, on the other hand, form out
of gas that flows in with similar angular momentum to that of earlier-accreted
material. Gas accretion from a hot corona thus favours disk formation, whereas
gas that flows ""cold"", often along separate, misaligned filaments, favours the
formation of spheroids. In this scenario, most spheroids consist of
superpositions of stellar components with distinct kinematics, age, and
metallicity, an arrangement that might survive to the present day given the
paucity of major mergers. Since angular momentum is acquired largely at
turnaround, morphology is imprinted early by the interplay of the tidal field
and the shape of the material destined to form the galaxy.

We show that point processes with smaller void probabilities and factorial

phase transition in the percolation of some coverage models based on level-sets
of additive functionals of the point process. Examples of such point processes
are determinantal point processes, some perturbed lattices, and more generally,
negatively associated point processes. Examples of such coverage models are
$k$-coverage in the Boolean model (coverage by at least $k$ grains) and
SINR-coverage (coverage if the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio is
large). In particular, we answer in affirmative the hypothesis of existence of
phase transition in the percolation of $k$-faces in the \v{C}ech simplicial
complex (called also clique percolation) on point processes which cluster less
than the Poisson process. We also construct a Cox point process, which is ""more
clustered"" than the Poisson point process and whose Boolean model percolates
for arbitrarily small radius. This shows that clustering (at least, as detected
by our specific tools) does not always ""worsen"" percolation, as well as that
upper-bounding this clustering by a Poisson process is a consequential
assumption for the phase transition to hold.

Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with redshift z=0.4-2.5. The distribution of relative
X-ray brightness for our low-redshift weak-line quasar (WLQ) candidates is
significantly different from that of typical radio-quiet quasars, having an
excess of X-ray weak sources, but it is consistent with that of high-redshift
WLQs. The X-ray weak sources generally show similar UV emission-line properties
to those of the X-ray weak quasar PHL 1811; they may belong to the notable
class of PHL 1811 analogs. The average X-ray spectrum of these sources is
somewhat harder than that of typical radio-quiet quasars. Several other
low-redshift WLQ candidates have normal ratios of X-ray-to-optical/UV flux, and
their average X-ray spectral properties are also similar to those of typical
radio-quiet quasars. The X-ray weak and X-ray normal WLQ candidates may belong
to the same subset of quasars having high-ionization ""shielding gas"" covering
most of the wind-dominated broad emission-line region, but be viewed at
different inclinations. The mid-infrared-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of these sources are generally consistent with those of typical SDSS
quasars, showing that they are not likely to be BL Lac objects with
relativistically boosted continua and diluted emission lines. However, one
source in our X-ray observed sample is remarkably strong in X-rays, indicating
that a small fraction of low-redshift WLQ candidates may actually be BL Lacs
residing in the radio-faint tail of the BL Lac population. We also investigate
universal selection criteria for WLQs over a wide range of redshift, finding
that it is not possible to select WLQ candidates in a fully consistent way
using different prominent emission lines as a function of redshift.

auxiliary-field resummation of the theory in terms of the normal- and
anomalous-density condensates. The mean-field phase diagram of this theory
features two critical temperatures, T_c and $T^*, associated with the presence
in the system of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and superfluid state,
respectively. In this context, the Josephson relation shows that the superfluid
density is related to a second order parameter, the square of the
anomalous-density condensate. This is in contrast with the corresponding result
in the Bose gas theory without an anomalous condensate, which predicts that the
superfluid density is proportional to the BEC condensate density. Our findings
are consistent with the prediction that in the temperature range between T_c
and T^* a fraction of the system is in the superfluid state in the absence of
the BEC condensate. This situation is similar to the case of dilute Fermi
gases, where the superfluid density is proportional to the square of the gap
parameter. The Josephson relation relies on the existence of zero energy and
momentum excitations showing the intimate relationship between superfluidity
and the Goldstone theorem.

Methods. In our analysis we compare the brightness distribution of the jet in

obtain a consistent estimate of the time that the jet was launched from the
solar surface and an approximate initial velocity distribution in the jet
source. The method also allows us to check the consistency of the kinetic
model. In this first application, we consider only gravity as the dominant
force on the jet particles along the magnetic field. Results. We find that the
kinetic model explains the observed brightness evolution well. The derived
initiation time is consistent with the jet observations by the EUVI telescope
at various wavelengths. The initial particle velocity distribution is fitted by
Maxwellian distributions and we find deviations of the high energy tail from
the Maxwellian distributions. We estimate the jet's total electron content to

integrated particle number along the jet trajectory to its source region and

measurements of the resistive transition to the normal state on the plain
bridge show two distinct regions, which can be identified as bulk and edge
superconductivity, respectively. The latter case appears when bulk
superconductivity becomes suppressed at the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ and
below the critical field of edge superconductivity $H_{c3}\approx 1.7\,
H_{c2}$. The presence of additional edges in the AD bridge leads to a different
shape of the $R(H)$ curves. We used low-temperature scanning laser microscopy
(LTSLM) to visualize the current distribution in the plain and AD bridge upon
sweeping $H$. While the plain bridge shows a dominant LTSLM signal at its edges
for $H > H_{c2}$ the AD bridge also gives a signal from the inner parts of the
bridge due to the additional edge states around the ADs. LTSLM reveals an
asymmetry in the current distribution between left and right edges, which
confirms theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the experimental results are in
good agreement with our numerical simulations (based on the time-dependent
Ginzburg--Landau model) yielding the spatial distribution of the order

line and environment from the local galaxy density. Our analysis shows that for
massive galaxies M_*>10^10 M_sun, the fraction of [OII] emitters in
high-density environments is 1.7 times higher than in low-density environments,
while the [OII] emitter fraction does not depend on environment for low-mass
M_* < 10^10 M_sun galaxies. In order to understand what drives these trends, we
investigate the role of companion galaxies in our sample. We find that the
fraction of [OII] emitters in galaxies with companions is 2.4 times as high as
that in galaxies without companions at M_* > 10^10 M_sun. In addition, massive
galaxies are more likely to have companions in high-density environments.
However, although the ""number"" of star forming galaxies increases for massive
galaxies with close companions and in dense environments, the ""average"" star
formation rate of star forming galaxies at a given mass is independent of
environment and the presence/absence of a close companion. These results
suggest that interactions and/or mergers in high-density environment could
induce star formation in massive galaxies at z~1.2, increasing the fraction of

is that the finite-state encryptability is equal to the finite-state

This type of interaction has recently been evoked to interpret measurements of
Casimir forces in vacuo, where a precise analysis of such disorder-induced

behavior with the separation distance between the juxtaposed surfaces and that,
in particular, its root-mean-square value scales with the total area of the
surfaces. Therefore, the disorder-induced torque between two randomly charged
surfaces is expected to be much more pronounced than the disorder-induced
lateral force and may provide an effective way to determine possible disorder
effects in experiments, in a manner that is independent of the usual normal
force measurement.

even if the other applications of it are much more obvious. The angler goes
fishing. He uses various techniques and he has at most two fishing rods. He
buys a fishing ticket for a fixed time. The fishes are caught with the use of
different methods according to the renewal processes. The fishes' value and the
inter arrival times are given by the sequences of independent, identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with the known distribution functions. It
forms the marked renewal--reward process. The angler's measure of satisfaction
is given by the difference between the utility function, depending on the value
of the fishes caught, and the cost function connected with the time of fishing.
In this way, the angler's relative opinion about the methods of fishing is
modelled. The angler's aim is to have as much satisfaction as possible and
additionally he has to leave the lake before a fixed moment. Therefore his goal
is to find two optimal stopping times in order to maximize his satisfaction. At
the first moment, he changes the technique of fishing, e.g. by excluding one
rod and intensifying on the rest. Next, he decides when he should stop the
expedition. These stopping times have to be shorter than the fixed time of
fishing. The dynamic programming methods have been used to find these two
optimal stopping times and to specify the expected satisfaction of the angler
at these times.

thrived over the last decade. While exhaustive search remains asymptotically
the fastest known algorithm for some basic problems, difficult and non-trivial
exponential time algorithms have been found for a myriad of problems, including
Graph Coloring, Hamiltonian Path, Dominating Set and 3-CNF-Sat. In some
instances, improving these algorithms further seems to be out of reach. The
CNF-Sat problem is the canonical example of a problem for which the trivial
exhaustive search algorithm runs in time O(2^n), where n is the number of
variables in the input formula. While there exist non-trivial algorithms for
CNF-Sat that run in time o(2^n), no algorithm was able to improve the growth
rate 2 to a smaller constant, and hence it is natural to conjecture that 2 is
the optimal growth rate. The strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) by
Impagliazzo and Paturi [JCSS 2001] goes a little bit further and asserts that,
for every epsilon<1, there is a (large) integer k such that that k-CNF-Sat
cannot be computed in time 2^{epsilon n}.

Set Splitting, and NAE-Sat cannot be computed in time O(2^{epsilon n}) unless
SETH fails. Here n is the number of elements or variables in the input. For
these problems, we actually get an equivalence to SETH in a certain sense. We
conjecture that SETH implies a similar statement for Set Cover, and prove that,
under this assumption, the fastest known algorithms for Steinter Tree,
Connected Vertex Cover, Set Partitioning, and the pseudo-polynomial time
algorithm for Subset Sum cannot be significantly improved. Finally, we justify
our assumption about the hardness of Set Cover by showing that the parity of

acceleration which takes advantage of the localization of the field of view
(FOV) of coils in an array. In this letter we show that metamaterial lenses
based on capacitively-loaded rings can provide higher localization of the FOV.
Several lens designs are systematically analyzed in order to find the structure
providing higher signal-to-noise-ratio. The magnetoinductive (MI) lens is find
to be the optimum structure and an experiment is developed to show it. The
ability of the fabricated MI lenses to accelerate the image is quantified by
means of the parameter known in the MRI community as g-factor.

real-valued function with analytic continuation in the first quadrant, except
possibly a branch point of algebraic type at the origin. When $x=0$, the

divergent. Asymptotic expansions in inverse powers of $\omega$ are derived for
each fixed $x\geq 0$, which clarify the large $\omega$ behavior of this
transform. We then present efficient and affordable approaches for numerical
evaluation of such oscillatory transforms. Depending on the position of $x$, we
classify our discussion into three regimes, namely, $x=\mathcal{O}(1)$ or
$x\gg1$, $0<x\ll 1$ and $x=0$. Numerical experiments show that the convergence
of the proposed methods greatly improve when the frequency $\omega$ increases.

the islands coalesce. We then propose a two-step kinetic pathway to effectively
suppress the formation of GBs. In the first step, large aromatic hydrocarbon
molecules are deposited onto a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ superstructured Cu-Mn
alloyed surface to seed the initial carbon clusters of a single orientation; in
the second step, the seeded islands are enlarged through normal chemical vapor
deposition of methane to form a complete graphene sheet. The present approach
promises to overcome a standing obstacle in large scale single-crystal graphene

Dynamical systems with discrete and continuous spatial representations are

provides the governing differential equations, along with all the pertinent
initial and boundary conditions, as the Euler-Lagrange equations emanating from
