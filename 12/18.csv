formation inside molecular clouds. At the onset of star formation, radiation
from massive stars heats the surrounding gas, which suppresses the formation of
many low-mass stars. When simulating pre-main-sequence stars, their stellar
properties must be defined by a prestellar model. Different approaches to
prestellar modeling may yield quantitatively different results. In this paper,
we compare two existing prestellar models under identical initial conditions to
gauge whether the choice of model has any significant effects on the final
population of stars. The first model treats stellar radii and luminosities with
a ZAMS model, while separately estimating the accretion luminosity by
interpolating to published prestellar tracks. The second, more accurate
prestellar model self-consistently evolves the radius and luminosity of each
star under highly variable accretion conditions. Each is coupled to a
raytracing-based radiative feedback code that also treats ionization. The
impact of the self-consistent model is less ionizing radiation and less heating
during the early stages of star formation. This may affect final mass
distributions. We noted a peak stellar mass reduced by 8% from 47.3 Msun to
43.5 Msun in the evolutionary model, relative to the track-fit model. Also, the
difference in mass between the two largest stars in each case is reduced from
14 Msun to 7.5 Msun. The HII regions produced by these massive stars were also
seen to flicker on timescales down to the limit imposed by our timestep (< 560
years), rapidly changing in size and shape, confirming previous cluster
simulations using ZAMS-based estimates for prestellar ionizing flux.

However, commonly used microscopy methods are destructive, leading to the loss
of the important link between the obtained structural information and the
electronic and optical properties of the device. Alternative non-invasive
techniques such as optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance (ODNMR) so far
proved difficult in semiconductor nano-structures due to significant
strain-induced quadrupole broadening of the NMR spectra. Here, we develop new
high sensitivity techniques that move ODNMR to a new regime, allowing high
resolution spectroscopy of as few as 100000 quadrupole nuclear spins. By
applying these techniques to individual strained self-assembled quantum dots,
we measure strain distribution and chemical composition in the volume occupied
by the confined electron. Furthermore, strain-induced spectral broadening is
found to lead to suppression of nuclear spin magnetization fluctuations thus
extending spin coherence times. The new ODNMR methods have potential to be
applied for non-invasive investigations of a wide range of materials beyond
single nano-structures, as well as address the task of understanding and
control of nuclear spins on the nanoscale, one of the central problems in
quantum information processing.

slice-parallel video decoders on multicore systems. We assume that each of the
processors are Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) enabled such that they
can independently trade off performance for power, while taking the video
decoding workload into account. In the past, scheduling and DVFS policies in
multi-core systems have been formulated heuristically due to the inherent
complexity of the on-line multicore scheduling problem. The key contribution of
this report is that we rigorously formulate the problem as a Markov decision
process (MDP), which simultaneously takes into account the on-line scheduling
and per-core DVFS capabilities; the power consumption of the processor cores
and caches; and the loss tolerant and dynamic nature of the video decoder's
traffic. In particular, we model the video traffic using a Direct Acyclic Graph
(DAG) to capture the precedence constraints among frames in a Group of Pictures
(GOP) structure, while also accounting for the fact that frames have different
display/decoding deadlines and non-deterministic decoding complexities. The
objective of the MDP is to minimize long-term power consumption subject to a
minimum Quality of Service (QoS) constraint related to the decoder's
throughput. Although MDPs notoriously suffer from the curse of dimensionality,
we show that, with appropriate simplifications and approximations, the
complexity of the MDP can be mitigated. We implement a slice-parallel version
of H.264 on a multiprocessor ARM (MPARM) virtual platform simulator, which
provides cycle-accurate and bus signal-accurate simulation for different
processors. We use this platform to generate realistic video decoding traces
with which we evaluate the proposed on-line scheduling algorithm in Matlab.

from Eve is referred to as leakage. This can be viewed as a secrecy problem,
where we desire that the channel state itself be minimally leaked to Eve while
being communicated to Bob. The paper is aimed at characterizing the trade-off
region between amplification and leakage rates for such a system. An achievable
coding scheme is presented, wherein the transmitter transmits a partial state
information over the channel to facilitate the amplification process. For the
case when Bob observes a stronger signal than Eve, the achievable coding scheme
is enhanced with secure refinement. Outer bounds on the trade-off region are
also derived, and used in characterizing some special case results. In
particular, the optimal amplification-leakage rate difference, called as
differential amplification capacity, is characterized for the reversely
degraded discrete memoryless channel, the degraded binary, and the degraded
Gaussian channels. In addition, for the degraded Gaussian model, the extremal
corner points of the trade-off region are characterized, and the gap between
the outer bound and achievable rate-regions is shown to be less than half a bit

for a straightforward computation of corrections via a formal expansion and we
therefore view it as an improvement over the conventional mode-coupling theory

addition, the formalism we have introduced is flexible enough to allow for a
wide array of different approximation schemes, including density expansions.
The convergence criteria for our formal series are not worked out here, but the
second order equation that we derive is promising in the sense that it leads to
analytic and numerical results consistent with expectations from computer

operators and projected entangled pair operators, and naturally preserve

assess the validity of our algorithms, we provide preliminary benchmarking
calculations for the spin-1/2 quantum Ising model in a transverse field in both

tensor network approaches such as iDMRG and iTEBD in 1d, and iPEPS and TERG in
2d. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithms is also considered
and, in 2d, important differences are found depending on the chosen simulation
scheme. We also discuss further possibilities, such as 3d quantum lattice
systems, periodic boundary conditions, and real time evolution. This discussion
leads us to reinterpret the standard iTEBD and iPEPS algorithms in terms of
corner transfer matrices and corner tensors. Our paper also offers a
perspective on many properties of the corner transfer matrix and its
higher-dimensional generalizations in the light of novel tensor network
methods.

approximation. A kernel density estimate of a distribution is the convolution
of that distribution with a fixed kernel (e.g. Gaussian kernel). Given a subset
(i.e. a point set) of the input distribution, we can compare the kernel density
estimates of the input distribution with that of the subset and bound the worst
case error. If the maximum error is eps, then this subset can be thought of as
an eps-sample (aka an eps-approximation) of the range space defined with the
input distribution as the ground set and the fixed kernel representing the
family of ranges. Interestingly, in this case the ranges are not binary, but
have a continuous range (for simplicity we focus on kernels with range of
[0,1]); these allow for smoother notions of range spaces.
  It turns out, the use of this smoother family of range spaces has an added
benefit of greatly decreasing the size required for eps-samples. For instance,
in the plane the size is O((1/eps^{4/3}) log^{2/3}(1/eps)) for disks (based on
VC-dimension arguments) but is only O((1/eps) sqrt{log (1/eps)}) for Gaussian
kernels and for kernels with bounded slope that only affect a bounded domain.
These bounds are accomplished by studying the discrepancy of these ""kernel""
range spaces, and here the improvement in bounds are even more pronounced. In
the plane, we show the discrepancy is O(sqrt{log n}) for these kernels, whereas
for balls there is a lower bound of Omega(n^{1/4}).

in the electronic and thermal conductance spectra, which can also be reversed
by an applied local magnetic flux with its phase factor $\phi=\pi$. And, the
Fano effect contributes decisively to the enhancement of thermoelectric
efficiency. However, at the same temperature, the thermoelectric effect in the
case of $\phi=\pi$ is much more apparent, compared with the case of zero
magnetic flux. By the concept of Feynman path, we analyze the difference
between the quantum interferences in the cases of $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\pi$. It
is seen that in the absence of magnetic flux the Fano interference originates
from the quantum interference among infinite-order Feynman paths, but it occurs
only between two lowest-order Feynman paths when $\phi=\pi$. The increase of
temperature inevitably destroys the electron coherent transmission in each
paths. So, in the case of zero magnetic field, the thermoelectric effect
contributed by the Fano interference is easy to weaken by a little increase of

following guarantee: For any $\epsilon,\delta \in (0,1)$, given cost and demand
graphs with edge weights $C, D$ respectively, we can find a set $T\subseteq V$
with $\frac{C(T,V\setminus T)}{D(T,V\setminus T)}$ at most
$\frac{1+\epsilon}{\delta}$ times the optimal non-uniform sparsest cut value,
in time $2^{r/(\delta\epsilon)}\poly(n)$ provided $\lambda_r \ge
\Phi^*/(1-\delta)$. Here $\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th smallest generalized
eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrices of cost and demand graphs; $C(T,V\setminus
T)$ (resp. $D(T,V\setminus T)$) is the weight of edges crossing the
$(T,V\setminus T)$ cut in cost (resp. demand) graph and $\Phi^*$ is the
sparsity of the optimal cut. In words, we show that the non-uniform sparsest
cut problem is easy when the generalized spectrum grows moderately fast. To the
best of our knowledge, there were no results based on higher order spectra for
non-uniform sparsest cut prior to this work.
  Even for uniform sparsest cut, the quantitative aspects of our result are
somewhat stronger than previous methods. Similar results hold for other
expansion measures like edge expansion, normalized cut, and conductance, with
the $r$'th smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian playing the role of
$\lambda_r$ in the latter two cases.
  Our proof is based on an l1-embedding of vectors from a semi-definite program
from the Lasserre hierarchy. The embedded vectors are then rounded to a cut
using standard threshold rounding. We hope that the ideas connecting
$\ell_1$-embeddings to Lasserre SDPs will find other applications. Another
aspect of the analysis is the adaptation of the column selection paradigm from
our earlier work on rounding Lasserre SDPs [GS11] to pick a set of edges rather
than vertices. This feature is important in order to extend the algorithms to
non-uniform sparsest cut.

model with symmetric gains, we establish convexity, implying that the globally
optimal controller can be computed efficiently. We also identify a class of
convex problems for double-integrators by restricting the controller to
symmetric position and uniform diagonal velocity gains. To obtain the optimal
non-symmetric gains for both the single- and the double-integrator models, we
solve a parameterized family of optimal control problems ranging from an easily
solvable problem to the problem of interest as the underlying parameter
increases. When this parameter is kept small, we employ perturbation analysis
to decouple the matrix equations that result from the optimality conditions,
thereby rendering the unique optimal feedback gain. This solution is used to
initialize a homotopy-based Newton's method to find the optimal localized gain.
To investigate the performance of localized controllers, we examine how the
coherence of large-scale stochastically forced formations scales with the
number of vehicles. We establish several explicit scaling relationships and
show that the best performance is achieved by a localized controller that is
both non-symmetric and spatially-varying.

dominantly composed of single photons, the multi-photon probability varies

get a factorized ground state is investigated for non-frustrated spin models in

models in which their lattice structures do not provide a single uniform
magnetic field to suppress the quantum correlations. Some of these models may
have a factorized ground state in the presence of a uniform and a staggered

which their ground state could be factorized whether a staggered field is
applied to the system or not. For the latter case, in the absence of a
staggered field the factorizing uniform field is unique. However, the degrees
of freedom for obtaining the factorization conditions are increased by adding a

directly extracting the coefficients of scalar master integrals (with single
propagators only) from one-loop Feynman integrals with generic power of
propagators. Unlike the usual integration-by-parts (IBP) technique, where one
has to solve iteratively a complicated set of equations to carry out the
reduction and determine the coefficients of scalar master integrals, using
multidimensional residues provides the possibility of directly extracting the

show how to directly extract the scalar box integral coefficients.

as a result, leave a signature of these changes in individual genomes in the
population. We are interested in the inverse problem of reconstructing past
population dynamics from genomic data. We start with a standard framework based
on the coalescent, a stochastic process that generates genealogies connecting
randomly sampled individuals from the population of interest. These genealogies
serve as a glue between the population demographic history and genomic
sequences. It turns out that only the times of genealogical lineage
coalescences contain information about population size dynamics. Viewing these
coalescent times as a point process, estimating population size trajectories is
equivalent to estimating a conditional intensity of this point process.
Therefore, our inverse problem is similar to estimating an inhomogeneous
Poisson process intensity function. We demonstrate how recent advances in
Gaussian process-based nonparametric inference for Poisson processes can be
extended to Bayesian nonparametric estimation of population size dynamics under
the coalescent. We compare our Gaussian process (GP) approach to one of the
state of the art Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) methods for estimating
population trajectories. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method
has better accuracy and precision. Next, we analyze two genealogies
reconstructed from real sequences of hepatitis C and human Influenza A viruses.
In both cases, we recover more believed aspects of the viral demographic
histories than the GMRF approach. We also find that our GP method produces more
reasonable uncertainty estimates than the GMRF method.

use of isolated attosecond pulses (streaking). The connection between the

the observed time-delays is a sum of two components: a one-photon Wigner-like

The multicast capacity of an ad- hoc wireless network decreases with an
increasing number of transmitting and/or receiving nodes within a fixed area.
Digital Network Coding (DNC) has been shown to improve the multicast capacity
of non-interfering wireless network. However recently proposed Physical-layer
Network Coding (PNC) and Analog Network Coding (ANC) has shown that it is
possible to decode an unknown packet from the collision of two packet, when one
of the colliding packet is known a priori. Taking advantage of such collision
decoding scheme, in this paper we propose a Joint Network Coding based
Cooperative Retransmission (JNC- CR) scheme, where we show that ANC along with
DNC can offer a much higher retransmission gain than that attainable through
either ANC, DNC or Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) based retransmission. This
scheme can be applied for two wireless multicast groups interfering with each
other. Because of the broadcast nature of the wireless transmission, receivers
of different multicast group can opportunistically listen and cache packets
from the interfering transmitter. These cached packets, along with the packets
the receiver receives from its transmitter can then be used for decoding the
JNC packet. We validate the higher retransmission gain performance of JNC with
an optimal DNC scheme, using simulation.

close protostellar binaries with extended radii could lead to massive tight
binaries, which are a possible progenitor of gamma ray bursts.

and play a key role in almost all fields of science including physics, biology,
ecology, climatology and sociology. In general, the published works on network
synchronization are based on data analysis and simulations, with little
experimental verification. Here we develop and experimentally demonstrate
various multi-cluster phase synchronization scenarios within coupled laser
networks. Synchronization is controlled by the network connectivity in
accordance to number theory, whereby the number of synchronized clusters equals
the greatest common divisor of network loops. This dependence enables remote
switching mechanisms to control the optical phase coherence among distant
lasers by local network connectivity adjustments. Our results serve as a
benchmark for a broad range of coupled oscillators in science and technology,
and offer feasible routes to achieve multi-user secure protocols in
communication networks and parallel distribution of versatile complex
combinatorial tasks in optical computers.

statistics of radiation emitted below the threshold of parametric resonance in
a Josephson junction circuit. In contrast to most optical systems, a
significant part of emitted radiation can be collected and converted to an
output signal. This permits studying the correlations of the radiation.
  To quantify the correlations, we derive a closed expression for full counting
statistics in the limit of long measurement times. We demonstrate that the
statistics can be interpreted in terms of uncorrelated bursts each encompassing
2N photons, this accounts for the bunching of the photon pairs produced in
course of the parametric resonance. We present the details of the burst rates.
In addition, we study the time correlations within the bursts and discuss
experimental signatures of the statistics deriving the frequency-resolved
cross-correlations.

method is an extension of that used by Orrick to resolve the previously
smallest unknown order of 15; and by Chadjipantelis, Kounias and Moyssiadis to
resolve orders 17 and 21. The method is a two-step computation which first
searches for candidate Gram matrices and then attempts to decompose them. Using
a similar method, we also find the complete spectrum of determinant values for

Segmentation plays an important role in chromosome karyotyping. The first step
in segmentation is to remove intrusive objects such as stain debris and other
noises. The next step is detection of touching and overlapping chromosomes, and
the final step is separation of such chromosomes. Common methods for separation
between touching chromosomes are interactive and require human intervention for
correct separation between touching and overlapping chromosomes. In this paper,
a geometric-based method is used for automatic detection of touching and
overlapping chromosomes and separating them. The proposed scheme performs
segmentation in two phases. In the first phase, chromosome clusters are
detected using three geometric criteria, and in the second phase, chromosome
clusters are separated using a cut-line. Most of earlier methods did not work
properly in case of chromosome clusters that contained more than two
chromosomes. Our method, on the other hand, is quite efficient in separation of
such chromosome clusters. At each step, one separation will be performed and
this algorithm is repeated until all individual chromosomes are separated.
Another important point about the proposed method is that it uses the geometric
features of chromosomes which are independent of the type of images and it can
easily be applied to any type of images such as binary images and does not
require multispectral images as well. We have applied our method to a database
containing 62 touching and partially overlapping chromosomes and a success rate
of 91.9% is achieved.

been designed to make angular measurements on a global scale with
micro-arcsecond accuracy. A key component of the data processing for Gaia is
the astrometric core solution, which must implement an efficient and accurate
numerical algorithm to solve the resulting, extremely large least-squares
problem. The Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) is a framework that
allows to implement a range of different iterative solution schemes suitable
for a scanning astrometric satellite. In order to find a computationally
efficient and numerically accurate iteration scheme for the astrometric
solution, compatible with the AGIS framework, we study an adaptation of the
classical conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, and compare it to the so-called
simple iteration (SI) scheme that was previously known to converge for this
problem, although very slowly. The different schemes are implemented within a
software test bed for AGIS known as AGISLab, which allows to define, simulate
and study scaled astrometric core solutions. After successful testing in
AGISLab, the CG scheme has been implemented also in AGIS. The two algorithms CG
and SI eventually converge to identical solutions, to within the numerical
noise (of the order of 0.00001 micro-arcsec). These solutions are independent
of the starting values (initial star catalogue), and we conclude that they are
equivalent to a rigorous least-squares estimation of the astrometric
parameters. The CG scheme converges up to a factor four faster than SI in the
tested cases, and in particular spatially correlated truncation errors are much
more efficiently damped out with the CG scheme.

sensing in the terahertz frequency range. Although the thickness of the
dielectric film can be very small compared with the wavelength, the required
area of sensed material is still determined by the diffraction-limited spot
size of the terahertz beam excitation. In this article, terahertz near-field
sensing is utilized to reduce the spot size. By positioning the metamaterial
sensing platform close to the sub-diffraction terahertz source, the number of
excited resonators, and hence minimal film area, are significantly reduced. As
an additional advantage, a reduction in the number of excited resonators
decreases the inter-cell coupling strength, and consequently the resonance Q
factor is remarkably increased. The experimental results show that the
resonance Q factor is improved by 113%. Moreover, for a film with a thickness
of \lambda/375 the minimal area can be as small as 0.2\lambda by 0.2\lambda.
The success of this work provides a platform for future metamaterial-based
sensors for biomolecular detection.
