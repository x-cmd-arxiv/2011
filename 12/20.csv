examined. We show that in the linear regime, the evolution of the laser pulse
length is affected by the frequency chirp, and that positive (negative) chirp
compresses (stretches) the laser pulse, thereby increasing (decreasing) the
peak vector potential and wakefield amplitude. In the blowout regime, the
frequency chirp can be used to fine tune the localized etching rates at the
front of the laser. In our simulations, chirped laser pulses can lead to 15%
higher self-trapped electrons, and 10% higher peak energies as compare to the
transform-limited pulse. Chirps may be used to control the phase velocity of
the wake, and to relax the self-guiding conditions at the front of the laser.
Our predictions are confirmed by multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations
with OSIRIS.

dark matter to account for the relic density measured by the WMAP and satisfy
the XENON limits on its scattering rate with the nucleon. For the collider
constraints, we consider all relevant direct and indirect limits from LEP,
Tevatron and LHC as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Especially, for
the limits from B_s->\mu^+\mu^-, we either directly consider its branching
ratio with the latest LHC data or alternatively consider the double ratio of
the purely leptonic decays defined by [Br(B_s->\mu^+\mu^-)/Br(B_u->\tau

these constraints, the mass of the lightest Higgs boson (h) in both the CMSSM

considering its theoretical uncertainty. We also find that for these models the

different contexts including, tuning the strange quark mass, approaching the

gauge configurations. In case of re-weighting the sea quark mass, the
re-weighting factor is given by the ratio of the determinants of two Dirac
operators $D_a$ and $D_b$. A popular approach for computing this ratio is to
use a pseudofermion representation of the determinant of the composite operator
$\Omega=D_a(D_b^\dagger D_b)^{-1} D_a^\dagger$. Here, we study using quadrature
methods together with noise vectors to compute the ratio of determinants. We
show that, with quadrature methods each determinant can be computed separately
using the operators $\Omega_a=D_a^\dagger D_a$ and $\Omega_b=D_b^\dagger D_b$.
We also discuss using bootstrap re-sampling to remove the bias from the

become collinear. At the tree level, this behaviour is known to be controlled
by factorization formulae in which the singular collinear factor is universal
(process independent). We show that this strict (process-independent)
factorization is not valid at one-loop and higher-loop orders in the case of
the collinear limit in space-like regions (e.g., collinear radiation from
initial-state partons). We introduce a generalized version of all-order
collinear factorization, in which the space-like singular factors retain some
dependence on the momentum and colour charge of the non-collinear partons. We
present explicit results on one-loop and two-loop amplitudes for both the
two-parton and multiparton collinear limits. At the level of square amplitudes
and, more generally, cross sections in hadron--hadron collisions, the violation
of strict collinear factorization has implications on the non-abelian structure
of logarithmically-enhanced terms in perturbative calculations (starting from
the next-to-next-to-leading order) and on various factorization issues of mass
singularities (starting from the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order).

redshift 3 via Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission and the feasibility of cold accretion
as the main driver of Lya blobs (LABs). We run cosmological zoom simulations
focusing on 3 halos spanning two orders of magnitude in mass, roughly from
10^11 to 10^13 solar masses. We use a version of the Ramses code that includes
radiative transfer of UV photons, and we employ a refinement strategy that
allows us to resolve accretion streams in their natural environment to an
unprecedented level. For the first time, we self-consistently model
self-shielding in the cold streams from the cosmological UV background, which
enables us to predict their temperatures, ionization states and Lya
luminosities with improved accuracy. We find the efficiency of gravitational
heating in cold streams in a ~10^11 solar mass halo is around 10-20% throughout
most of the halo but reaching much higher values close to the center. As a
result most of the Lya luminosity comes from gas which is concentrated at the
central 20% of the halo radius, leading to Lya emission which is not extended.
In more massive halos, of >10^12 solar masses, cold accretion is complex and
disrupted, and gravitational heating does not happen as a steady process.
Ignoring the factors of Lya scattering, local UV enhancement, and SNe feedback,
cold accretion alone in these massive halos can produce LABs that largely agree
with observations in terms of morphology, extent, and luminosity. Our
simulations slightly and systematically over-predict LAB abundances, perhaps
hinting that the interplay of these ignored factors may have a negative net
effect on extent and luminosity. We predict that a factor of a few increase in
sensitivity from current observational limits should unambiguously reveal
continuum-free accretion streams around massive galaxies at z=3.

which are absent at low redshift. The lower luminosities at low redshifts can
be understood as the external manifestation of either a lower Eddington ratio
or a lower mass. To distinguish between both effects, we determine the possible
dependence of masses and Eddington ratios of QSOs with a fixed luminosity as a
function of redshifts; this avoids the Malmquist bias or any other selection
effect. For the masses and Eddington ratios derived for a sample of QSOs in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we model their evolution by a double linear fit
separating the dependence on redshifts and luminosities. The validity of the
fits and possible systematic effects were tested by the use of different
estimators of masses or bolometric luminosities, and possible intergalactic
extinction effects. The results do not show any significant evolution of black
hole masses or Eddington ratios for equal luminosity QSOs. The black hole mass
only depends on the bolometric luminosity without significant dependence on the
redshift as M_{BH}(10^9 M_sun) = 3.4[L_{bol}(10^{47} erg/s})]^{0.65} on average
for z<5. This must not be confused with the possible evolution in the formation
of black holes in QSOs. The variations of environment might influence the
formation of the black holes but not its subsequent accretion. It also leaves a
question to be solved: Why are there not QSOs with very high mass at low
redshift? A brief discussion of the possible reasons for this is tentatively

one relates the module $\Omega_{A/k}$ of K\""ahler $k$-differentials of $A$ to
the transposed Jacobian module $\mathcal{D}\subset \sum_{i=1}^n R dx_i$ of the
forms $f_1,...,f_m$ by means of a {\em Leibniz map} $\Omega_{A/k}\rar
\mathcal{D}$ whose kernel is the torsion of $\Omega_{A/k}$. Letting $\fp$
denote the $R$-submodule generated by the (image of the) syzygy module of
$\Omega_{A/k}$ and $\fz$ the syzygy module of $\mathcal{D}$, there is a natural
inclusion $\fp\subset \fz$ coming from the chain rule for composite

polarizable forms. The problem has some curious connections with constructs of
commutative algebra, such as the Jacobian ideal, the conormal module and its
torsion, homological dimension in $R$ and syzygies, complete intersections and
Koszul algebras. Some of these connections trigger questions which have

essential part of distributed computing, and also an inherent challenge. In
1978, an analysis of communication in asynchronous systems was suggested by
Leslie Lamport. Lamport's analysis determines a notion of temporal precedence,
a sort of weak notion of time, which is otherwise missing in asynchronous
systems. This notion has been extensively utilized in various applications.
  Yet the analysis is limited to systems that are asynchronous. In this thesis
we go beyond by investigating causality in synchronous systems. In such
systems, the boundaries of causal influence are not charted out exclusively by
message passing. Here time itself, passing at a uniform (or almost uniform)
rate for all processes, is also a medium by which causal influence may fan out.
This thesis studies, and characterizes, the combinations of time and message
passing that govern causal influence in synchronous systems.
  It turns out that knowledge based analysis [FHMV] provides a well tailored
formal framework within which causal notions can be studied. As we show, the
formal notion of knowledge is highly appropriate for characterizing causal
influence in terms of information flow, broadening the analysis of Chandy and
Misra in [ChM].
  We define several generic classes of coordination problems that pose various
temporal ordering requirements on the participating processes. These
coordination problems provide natural generalizations of real life
requirements. We then analyze the causal conditions that underlie suitable
solutions to these problems. The analysis is conducted in two stages: first,
the temporal ordering requirements are reduced to epistemic conditions. Then,
these epistemic conditions are characterized in terms of the causal
communication patterns that are necessary and sufficient to bring them about.

the study of the cosmic shear beyond the small-angle approximation and
including general relativistic corrections that are usually suppressed on
sub-Hubble scales. The complete expression of the reduced cosmic shear at
second order including all relativistic effects was derived in [1]. In the
present paper we compute the resulting cosmic shear bispectrum when all these
effects are properly taken into account and we compare it to primordial
non-Gaussianity of the local type. The new general relativistic effects are
generically smaller than the standard non-linear couplings. However, their
relative importance increases at small multipoles and for small redshifts of
the sources. The dominant effect among these non standard corrections is due to
the inhomogeneity of the source redshift. In the squeezed limit, its amplitude
can become of the order of the standard couplings when the redshift of the
sources is below 0.5. Moreover, while the standard non-linear couplings depend
on the angle between the short and long mode, the relativistic corrections do
not and overlap almost totally with local type non-Gaussianity. We find that
they can contaminate the search for a primordial local signal by f_NL>10.

liquid is an integrable, Hamiltonian system that forms a finite-time
singularity as the radius of the void collapses to zero. Here it is shown that
when the natural cylindrical symmetry of the void is perturbed azimuthally, the
perturbation modes neither grow nor decay, but instead cause constant amplitude
vibrations about the leading-order symmetric collapse. Though the amplitudes
are frozen in time, they grow relative to the mean radius which is collapsing
to zero, eventually overtaking the leading-order symmetric implosion. Including
weak viscous dissipation destroys the integrability of the underlying symmetric
implosion, and the effect on the stability spectrum is that short-wavelength
disturbances are now erased as the implosion proceeds. Introducing a weak
rotational flow component to the symmetric implosion dynamics causes the
vibrating shapes to spin as the mean radius collapses. The above theoretical
scenario is compared to a closely related experimental realization of void
implosion: the disconnection of an air bubble from an underwater nozzle. There,
the thin neck connecting the bubble to the nozzle implodes primarily radially
inward and disconnects. Recent experiments were able to induce vibrations of
the neck shape by releasing the bubble from a slot-shaped nozzle. The frequency
and amplitude of the observed vibrations are consistent with the theoretical
prediction once surface tension effects are taken into account.

encountered problems, including pure instrumental effects, the presence of
bright (8--9 mag) stars close to the cluster centre, ground based measurements
of high-z (z~0.8) clusters, and the presence of massive unrelated structures

MMT/Megacam. Instrumental effects are checked in detail by cross-comparison
with an archival CFHT/MegaCam observation. We derive mass estimates for seven
clusters by modelling the tangential shear with an NFW profile, in two cases
with multiple components to account for projected structures in the
line-of-sight. We firmly detect lensing signals from all seven clusters at more

High energy electrons accelerated during solar flare are abundant in
the solar corona and in the interplanetary space. Commonly, the number and the
energy of non-thermal electrons at the Sun is estimated using hard X-ray (HXR)
spectral observations (e.g. RHESSI) and a single-particle collisional
approximation. Aims. To investigate the role of the spectrally evolving
Langmuir turbulence on the population of energetic electrons in the solar
corona. Methods. We numerically simulate the relaxation of a power-law
non-thermal electron population in a collisional inhomogeneous plasma including
wave-particle, and wave-wave interactions. Results. The numerical simulations
show that the long-time evolution of electron population above 20 keV deviates
substantially from the collisional approximation when wave-particle
interactions in non-uniform plasma are taken into account. The evolution of
Langmuir wave spectrum towards smaller wavenumbers, due to large-scale density
fluctuations and wave-wave interactions, leads to an effective acceleration of
electrons. Furthermore, the time-integrated spectrum of non-thermal electrons,
which is normally observed with HXR above 20 keV, is noticeably increased due
to acceleration of non-thermal electrons by Langmuir waves. Conclusions. The
results show that the observed HXR spectrum, when interpreted in terms of
collisional relaxation, can lead to an overestimated number and energy of
energetic electrons accelerated in the corona.

most successful Evolution Strategy at exploiting covariance information; it
uses a form of Principle Component Analysis which, under certain conditions, is

practice, there exist conditions where CMA-ES converges to the global optimum

These circumstances can involve high-dimensional landscapes with large

Optimal Covariance Adaptive Learning (FOCAL), with the explicit goal of
determining the Hessian at the global basin of attraction. It begins by
introducing theoretical foundations to the inverse relationship between the

demonstrated to retrieve the Hessian matrix with high fidelity on both model
landscapes and experimental Quantum Control systems, which are observed to
possess a non-separable, non-quadratic search landscape. The recovered Hessian

constitutes an example for Natural Computing successfully serving other

a cluster analysis to measure a new concept of a structure called
""Folksodriven"", which consists of tags, source and time. Many approaches
include in their goals the use of folksonomy that could evolve during time to
evaluate characteristics. This paper describes an alternative where the goal is
to develop a weighted network of tags where link strengths are based on the

connectivity correlations among nodes in this network. The paper proposes and
analyzes the network structure of the Folksodriven tags thought as folksonomy

observed that the hypergraphs of the Folksodriven are highly connected and that
the relative path lengths are relatively low, facilitating thus the

reinsurance --- a mutual reserve system that is intended for the collective
reinsurance needs of homogeneous mutual members, such as P&I Clubs in marine
mutual insurance and reserve banks in the U.S. Federal Reserve. Compared to
general (non-mutual) insurance models, which involve one-sided impulse control
(i.e., either downside or upside impulse) of the underlying insurance reserve
process that is required to be positive, a mutual insurance differs in allowing
two-sided impulse control (i.e., both downside and upside impulse), coupled
with the classical proportional control of reinsurance. We prove that a special
band-type impulse control $(a,A,B,b)$ with $a=0$ and $a<A<B<b$, coupled with a
proportional reinsurance policy (classical control), is optimal when the
objective is to minimize the total maintenance cost. That is, when the reserve
position reaches a lower boundary of $a=0$, the reserve should immediately be
raised to level $A$; when the reserve reaches an upper boundary of $b$, it
should immediately be reduced to a level $B$. An interesting finding produced
by the study reported in this paper is that there exists a situation such that
if the upside fixed cost is relatively large in comparison to a finite
threshold, then the optimal band control is reduced to a downside only (i.e.,
dividend payment only) control in the form of $(0,0;B,b)$ with $a=A=0$. In this
case, it is optimal for the mutual insurance firm to go bankrupt as soon as its
reserve level reaches zero, rather than to jump restart by calling for
additional contingent funds. This finding partially explains why many mutual
insurance companies, that were once quite popular in the financial markets, are
either disappeared or converted to non-mutual ones.

even before its publication [2,3]. Since then, a number of readers requested
the ankylographic reconstruction codes from us. To facilitate a better
understanding of ankylography, we posted the source codes of the ankylographic
reconstruction on a public website and encouraged interested readers to
download the codes and test the method [4]. Those who have tested our codes
confirm that the principle of ankylography works. Furthermore, our mathematical
analysis and numerical simulations suggest that, for a continuous object with
array size of 14x14x14 voxels, its 3D structure can usually be reconstructed
from the diffraction intensities sampled on a spherical shell of 1 voxel thick
[4]. In some cases where the object does not have very dense structure,
ankylography can be applied to reconstruct its 3D image with array size of
25x25x25 voxels [4]. What remains to be elucidated is how to extend
ankylography to the reconstruction of larger objects, and what further
theoretical, experimental and algorithm developments will be necessary to make
ankylography a practical and useful imaging tool. Here we present our
up-to-date understanding of the potential and challenge of ankylography.
Further, we clarify some misconceptions on ankylography, and respond to
technical comments raised by Wei [5] and Wang et al. [6] Finally, it is
worthwhile to point out that the potential for recovering 3D information from
the Fourier coefficients within a spherical shell may also find application in
other fields.

and molecular gas masses for both local Galactic clouds and a sample of
external galaxies. We specifically consider relations between the star
formation rates and measurements of dense, as well as total, molecular gas
masses. We argue that there is a fundamental empirical scaling relation that
directly connects the local star formation process with that operating globally
within galaxies. Specifically, the total star formation rate in a molecular
cloud or galaxy is linearly proportional to the mass of dense gas within the
cloud or galaxy. This simple relation, first documented in previous studies,
holds over a span of mass covering nearly nine orders of magnitude and
indicates that the rate of star formation is directly controlled by the amount
of dense molecular gas that can be assembled within a star formation complex.
We further show that the star formation rates and total molecular masses,
characterizing both local clouds and galaxies, are correlated over similarly
large scales of mass and can be described by a family of linear star formation
scaling laws, parameterized by $f_{DG}$, the fraction of dense gas contained
within the clouds or galaxies. That is, the underlying star formation scaling
law is always linear for clouds and galaxies with the same dense gas fraction.
These considerations provide a single unified framework for understanding the

definition for the specific frequency of UCDs,
S_{N,UCD}=N_{UCD}*10^{0.4*(M_{V,host}-M_{V,0})}*c_{w}. The parameter M_{V,0} is
the zeropoint of the definition, chosen such that the specific frequency of
UCDs is the same as those of globular clusters, S_{N,GC}, if UCDs follow a
simple extrapolation of the GCLF. The parameter c_{w} is a correction term for
the GCLF width sigma. We apply our definition of S_{N,UCD} to results of
spectroscopic UCD searches in the Fornax, Hydra and Centaurus galaxy clusters,
two Hickson Compact Groups, and the Local Group. This includes a large database
of 180 confirmed UCDs in Fornax. We find that the specific frequencies derived
for UCDs match those of GCs very well, to within 10-50%. The ratio
{S_{N,UCD}}/{S_{N,GC}} is 1.00 +- 0.44 for the four environments Fornax, Hydra,
Centaurus, and Local Group, which have S_{N,GC} values. This good match also
holds for individual giant galaxies in Fornax and in the Fornax
intracluster-space. The error ranges of the derived UCD specific frequencies in
the various environments then imply that not more than 50% of UCDs were formed
from dwarf galaxies. We show that such a scenario would require >90% of
primordial dwarfs in galaxy cluster centers (<100 kpc) to have been stripped of
their stars. We conclude that the number counts of UCDs are fully consistent
with them being the bright tail of the GC population. From a statistical point
of view there is no need to invoke an additional formation channel.

tension between epsilon_K and S_{psi K_S} present in the SM can be removed by
enhancing |epsilon_K| without modifying S_{psi K_S}. In this case, we find that

SM-like, ii) the exclusive determination of |Vub| is favoured and most
importantly iii) the values of Delta M_{B_d} and Delta M_{B_s} being strongly
correlated in this model with epsilon_K turn out to be much larger than the
data for the central values of input parameters: Delta M_{B_d}~0.75/ps and
Delta M_{B_s}~27/ps. Therefore, from the present perspective, the model suffers
from a serious epsilon_K-Delta M_{B_{d,s}} tension. However, this tension can
be softened considering theoretical and parametric uncertainties and in
particular the decrease of the weak decay constants. On the other side, the
model can be strongly constrained considering the theoretically cleaner ratios
Delta M_{B_d}/Delta M_{B_s} and BR(B^+ -> tau^+ nu)/Delta M_{B_d} and we find
that it is unable to remove simultaneously all the SM tensions on the data.
Finally, we compare the pattern of flavour violation in MGF with selected

\sim10 galaxies per square arcmin are measured in the lensing survey and all
halos with M>M_min=10^13 h^{-1}M_solar have spectra. For the gravitational
growth parameter parameter \gamma (f=\Omega_m^{\gamma}), combining the lensing
information with RSD analysis of non-transverse modes yields accuracy
\sigma(\gamma)\sim 0.01. Adding lensing information to the RSD survey improves
\sigma(\gamma) by an amount equivalent to a 3 times (10 times) increase in RSD
survey area when the spectroscopic survey extends down to halo mass 10^13.5

surveys is equivalent to that of surveys 1.5-2 times larger if they are

threshold is 10^13 - 10^14 h^{-1} M_solar, similar to LRG surveys. The gain of
overlapping surveys is reduced for very deep or very shallow spectroscopic

field amplification. We find that, while compression results in some
amplification, turbulent velocity fluctuations driven by the collapse can
further amplify an initially weak seed field via dynamo action, provided there
is sufficient numerical resolution to capture vortical motions (we find this
requirement to be 64 zones per Jeans length, slightly larger than, but
consistent with previous work run with more idealized collapse scenarios). We
explore saturation of amplification of the magnetic field, which could
potentially become dynamically important in subsequent, fully-resolved
calculations. We have also identified a relatively surprising phenomena that is
purely hydrodynamic: the higher-resolved simulations possess substantially
different characteristics, including higher infall-velocity, increased
temperatures inside 1000 AU, and decreased molecular hydrogen content in the
innermost region. Furthermore, we find that disk formation is suppressed in
higher-resolution calculations, at least at the times that we can follow the
calculation. We discuss the effect this may have on the buildup of disks over
the accretion history of the first clump to form as well as the potential for
gravitational instabilities to develop and induce fragmentation.

that dark bursts events generate in much denser environments with respect to

of them is identified with the S-matrix describing the magnon excitations on
the string world sheet in AdS5 x S5, while another is the mirror S-matrix that
is needed for the TBA. In the g->infinity limit, the rapidity torus
degenerates, the branch points disappear and the S-matrices become meromorphic
functions, as required by relativistic S-matrix theory. However, it is only the
mirror S-matrix which satisfies the correct relativistic crossing equation. The
mirror S-matrix in the relativistic limit is then closely related to that of
the semi-symmetric space sine-Gordon theory obtained from the string theory by
the Pohlmeyer reduction, but has anti-symmetric rather than symmetric bound
states. The interpolating S-matrix realizes at the quantum level the fact that
at the classical level the two theories correspond to different limits of a
one-parameter family of symplectic structures of the same integrable system.

tracks in the muon detector. Time-of-Flight based methods for detecting these
particles become less efficient if the LLCPs are fast, which would typically be
the case if they are produced in the decays of some mother particle which is
either heavy or very boosted. Thus for example, in supersymmetric models with
long-lived sleptons, the long-lived sleptons produced in neutralino decays are
often fast, with beta above 0.95 even at a 7 TeV LHC. We propose to use the
(mis-measured) invariant mass distribution of ""muon""-lepton pairs, where the
""muon"" could be a slepton LLCP, to detect it. This distribution peaks somewhat
below the neutralino mass. The peak can be further enhanced by evaluating the
distribution for different values of candidate ""muon"" masses. We simulate two
GMSB-like models to show that this procedure can be used to detect the
long-lived sleptons and measure both their mass and the neutralino mass.

on the dynamics of eternal inflation. In eternal inflation, our observable
universe is contained in one of many bubbles formed from an inflating
metastable vacuum. The collision between bubbles can leave a detectable imprint
on the cosmic microwave background radiation. Although phenomenological models
of the observational signature have been proposed, to make the theory fully
predictive one must determine the bubble collision spacetime, and thus the
cosmological observables, from a scalar field theory giving rise to eternal
inflation. Because of the intrinsically non-linear nature of the bubbles and
their collision, this requires a numerical treatment incorporating General
Relativity. In this paper, we present results from numerical simulations of
bubble collisions in full General Relativity. These simulations allow us to
accurately determine the outcome of bubble collisions, and examine their effect
on the cosmology inside a bubble universe. We confirm the validity of a number
of approximations used in previous analytic work, and identify qualitatively
new features of bubble collision spacetimes. Both vacuum bubbles and bubbles
containing a realistic inflationary cosmology are studied. We identify the
constraints on the scalar field potential that must be satisfied in order to
obtain collisions that are consistent with our observed cosmology, yet leave
detectable signatures.

the Virgo and the Field samples feature highly sub-Eddington X-ray luminosities

influence of host galaxy stellar mass, the field early-type galaxies tend
toward marginally greater (0.38+/-0.14 dex) nuclear X-ray luminosities, at a

qualitatively consistent with the field black holes having access to a greater

We are able to rule out at high confidence the alternative of enhanced X-ray
activity within clusters. Presuming nuclear X-ray emission correlates with the
total energy and momentum output of these weakly accreting black holes, this
indicates that low-level active galactic nucleus feedback is not generally
stronger within typical cluster galaxies than in the field. These results
confirm that for most cluster early-type galaxies (i.e., excluding brightest

relevant in quenching star formation.

and can easily have large branching fractions to physics beyond the SM, making
Higgs decays an excellent opportunity to observe new physics. Decays into
collider-invisible particles are particularly interesting as they are
theoretically well motivated and relatively clean experimentally. In this work
we estimate the potential of the 7 and 8 TeV LHC to observe an invisible Higgs
branching fraction. We analyze three channels that can be used to directly
study the invisible Higgs branching ratio at the 7 TeV LHC: an invisible Higgs
produced in association with (i) a hard jet; (ii) a leptonic Z; and (iii)
forward tagging jets. We find that the last channel, where the Higgs is
produced via weak boson fusion, is the most sensitive, allowing branching
fractions as small as 40% to be probed at 20 inverse fb for masses in the range
between 120 and 170 GeV, including in particular the interesting region around
125 GeV. We provide an estimate of the 8 TeV LHC sensitivity to an
invisibly-decaying Higgs produced via weak boson fusion and find that the reach
is comparable to but not better than the reach at the 7 TeV LHC. We further
estimate the discovery potential at the 8 TeV LHC for cases where the Higgs has
substantial branching fractions to both visible and invisible final states.

computation process via quantum process tomography requires an exponential
amount of resources, and thus is not practical even for relatively small
devices. We solve this problem by demonstrating that twirling experiments
previously used to characterize the average fidelity of quantum memories
efficiently can be easily adapted to estimate the average fidelity of the
experimental implementation of important quantum computation processes, such as
unitaries in the Clifford group, in a practical and efficient manner with
applicability in current quantum devices. Using this procedure, we demonstrate
state-of-the-art coherent control of an ensemble of magnetic moments of nuclear
spins in a single crystal solid by implementing the encoding operation for a 3
qubit code with only a 1% degradation in average fidelity discounting
preparation and measurement errors. We also highlight one of the advances that
was instrumental in achieving such high fidelity control.

  Outburst Properties","11 pages, 11 figures; accepted by the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/747/2/117",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine the Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, encompassing
~736 d at 1 min cadence. During this span each system exhibited ~64-65
outbursts, including six superoutbursts. We find that, in both systems, the
normal outbursts between two superoutbursts increase in duration over time by a
factor ~1.2-1.9, and then reset to a small value after the following
superoutburst. In both systems the trend of quiescent intervals between normal
outbursts is to increase to a local maximum about half way through the
supercycle - the interval from one superoutburst to the next - and then to
decrease back to a small value by the time of the next superoutburst. This is
inconsistent with Osaki's thermal-tidal model, which predicts a monotonic
increase in the quiescent intervals between normal outbursts during a
supercycle. Also, most of the normal outbursts have an asymmetric,
fast-rise/slower-decline shape, consistent with outbursts triggered at large
radii. The exponential rate of decay of the plateau phase of the superoutbursts
is 8 d/mag for V1504 Cyg and 12 d/mag for V344 Lyr. This time scale gives a
direct measure of the viscous time scale in the outer accretion disk given the
expectation that the entire disk is in the hot, viscous state during
superoutburst. The resulting constraint on the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter,
alpha_{hot} ~ 0.1, is consistent with the value inferred from the fast dwarf
nova decays. By looking at the slow decay rate for superoutbursts, which occur
in systems below the period gap, in combination with the slow decay rate in one
long outburst above the period gap (in U Gem), we infer a steep dependence of
the decay rate on orbital period for long outbursts. This implies a steep
dependence of alpha_{cold} on orbital period, consistent with tidal torquing as
being the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism in quiescent disks in
interacting binary systems.

initially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transit
signals in the Kepler light curve of the host star 2MASSJ19104752+4220194. We
find a stellar effective temperature Teff=5455+-100K, a metallicity of
[Fe/H]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. Combined with an
estimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce a
stellar mass of Mstar=0.912+-0.034 Msun and a stellar radius of
Rstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} Rsun. For three of the transit signals, our
results strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysical
false positives. We conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely than
that of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (Kepler-20b), 1e5
(Kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (Kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects as
planetary companions. For Kepler-20c and Kepler-20d, the blend scenario is
independently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: From Spitzer data
gathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of
0.075+-0.015 (Kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (Kepler-20d), consistent with each
of the depths measured in the Kepler optical bandpass. We determine the orbital
periods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and
1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} Rearth for Kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}
Rearth for Kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} Rearth for
Kepler-20d. From multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses of
Kepler-20b and Kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 Mearth and 16.1+-3.5 Mearth,
respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of Kepler-20d of 20.1
Mearth (2 sigma).

timescale of a few days was observed with a peak flux of (0.70 +- 0.16) X
10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1} at energies above 350GeV. In 2010 April, VERITAS
detected a flare from M87 with peak flux of (2.71 +- 0.68) X 10^{-11} cm^{-2}
s^{-1} for E>350GeV. The source was observed for six consecutive nights during
the flare, resulting in a total of 21 hr of good quality data. The most rapid
flux variation occurred on the trailing edge of the flare with an exponential
flux decay time of 0.90^{+0.22}_{-0.15} days. The shortest detected exponential
rise time is three times as long, at 2.87^{+1.65}_{-0.99} days. The quality of
the data sample is such that spectral analysis can be performed for three
periods: rising flux, peak flux, and falling flux. The spectra obtained are
consistent with power-law forms. The spectral index at the peak of the flare is
equal to 2.19 +- 0.07. There is some indication that the spectrum is softer in
the falling phase of the flare than the peak phase, with a confidence level
corresponding to 3.6 standard deviations. We discuss the implications of these
results for the acceleration and cooling rates of VHE electrons in M87 and the
constraints they provide on the physical size of the emitting region.

exponential dichotomy of unstable and center-stable subspaces. By rewriting the
Euler equation as an ODE on an infinite dimensional manifold of volume
preserving maps in $W^{k, q}$, $(k>1+\frac{n}{q})$, the unstable (and stable)
manifolds of $v_{0}$ are constructed under certain spectral gap condition which
is verified for both 2D and 3D examples. In particular, when the unstable

the graph Laplacian eigenvectors constructed on a certain type of unweighted
trees, which we previously observed through our numerical experiments. The
eigenvalue distribution for such a tree is a smooth bell-shaped curve starting
from the eigenvalue 0 up to 4. Then, at the eigenvalue 4, there is a sudden
jump. Interestingly, the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues below 4
are semi-global oscillations (like Fourier modes) over the entire tree or one
of the branches; on the other hand, those corresponding to the eigenvalues
above 4 are much more localized and concentrated (like wavelets) around
junctions/branching vertices. For a special class of trees called starlike
trees, we obtain a complete understanding of such phase transition phenomenon.
For a general graph, we prove the number of the eigenvalues larger than 4 is
bounded from above by the number of vertices whose degrees is strictly higher
than 2. Moreover, we also prove that if a graph contains a branching path, then
the magnitudes of the components of any eigenvector corresponding to the
eigenvalue greater than 4 decay exponentially from the branching vertex toward
the leaf of that branch.

right-handed (RH) neutrino masses. For hierarchical RH neutrino masses lying in
the fully flavoured regimes, this reduces to multiple-stage Boltzmann
equations. In this case we recover and extend results previously derived within
a quantum state collapse description. We confirm the generic existence of
phantom terms. However, taking into account the effect of gauge interactions,
we show that they are washed out at the production with a wash-out rate that is
halved compared to that one acting on the total asymmetry. In the N_1-dominated
scenario they cancel without contributing to the final baryon asymmetry. In
other scenarios they do not in general and they have to be taken into account.
We also confirm that there is a (orthogonal) component in the asymmetry
produced by the heavier RH neutrinos which completely escapes the washout from
the lighter RH neutrinos and show that phantom terms additionally contribute to
it. The other (parallel) component is washed out with the usual exponential
factor, even for weak washout. Finally, as an illustration, we study the two RH
neutrino model in the light of the above findings, showing that phantom terms
can contribute to the final asymmetry also in this case.

formation of a diffuse wave driven by the expansion of a coronal mass ejection
(CME) and its subsequent separation from the CME front. The wave and the CME on
2011 June 7 were well observed by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard Solar
Dynamic Observatory. Following the solar eruption onset, marked by the
beginning of the rapid increasing of the CME velocity and the X-ray flux of
accompanying flare, the CME exhibits a strong lateral expansion. During this
impulsive expansion phase, the expansion speed of the CME bubble increases from
100 km s$^{-1}$ to 450 km s$^{-1}$ in only six minutes. An important finding is
that a diffuse wave front starts to separate from the front of the expanding
bubble shortly after the lateral expansion slows down. Also a type-II burst is
formed near the time of the separation. After the separation, two distinct
fronts propagate with different kinematic properties. The diffuse front travels
across the entire solar disk; while the sharp front rises up, forming the CME
ejecta with the diffuse front ahead of it. These observations suggest that the
previously termed EUV wave is a composite phenomenon and driven by the CME
expansion. While the CME expansion is accelerating, the wave front is cospatial
with the CME front, thus the two fronts are indiscernible. Following the end of
the acceleration phase, the wave moves away from the CME front with gradually
an increasing distance between them.

oscillations, a phenomenon originally observed by Huygens. The oscillation
angles are assumed to be small so that the pendulums are modeled by harmonic
oscillators, clock escapements are modeled by the van der Pol terms. The mass
ratio of the pendulum bobs to their casings is taken as a small parameter.
Analytic conditions for existence and stability of synchronization regimes, and
analytic expressions for their stable amplitudes and period corrections are
derived using the Poincare theorem on existence of periodic solutions in
autonomous quasi-linear systems. The anti-phase regime always exists and is
stable under variation of the system parameters. The in-phase regime may exist
and be stable, exist and be unstable, or not exist at all depending on
parameter values. As the damping in the frame connecting the clocks is
increased the in-phase stable amplitude and period are decreasing until the
regime first destabilizes and then disappears. The results are most complete
for the traditional three degrees of freedom model, where the clock casings and
the frame are consolidated into a single mass.

stars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to the
detection of true Earth analogues. The size of an exoplanet can be determined
when it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing a
decrease in starlight proportional to its radius. The smallest exoplanet
hitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the Earth's radius (R
Earth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. Here we report the discovery of two
planets, one Earth-sized (1.03R Earth) and the other smaller than the Earth
(0.87R Earth), orbiting the star Kepler-20, which is already known to host
three other, larger, transiting planets. The gravitational pull of the new
planets on the parent star is too small to measure with current
instrumentation. We apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood of
the planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three orders
of magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signals
result from an eclipsing binary star. Theoretical considerations imply that
these planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. The outer
planet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

transmitters and relays so that interference at the receivers can be aligned

from the relays and interference at the receivers. The second and third
algorithms rely on a connection between mean square error and mutual
information to solve the end-to-end sum-rate maximization problem with either
equality or inequality power constraints via matrix-weighted sum mean square
error minimization. The resulting iterative algorithms converge to stationary
points of the corresponding optimization problems. Simulations show that the
proposed algorithms achieve higher end-to-end sum-rates and multiplexing gains

connected with periodic saddle trajectories. Whereas, the statistics of long

index quantifying the absorption due to H2O opacity (the H2O-K2 index). Using
empirical spectral types standards and synthetic models, we calibrate the
H2O-K2 index as an indicator of an M dwarf's spectral type and effective
temperature. We also present a revised relationship that estimates the [Fe/H]

measurements. Comparisons to model atmosphere provide a qualitative validation
of our approach, but also reveal an overall offset between the atomic line
strengths predicted by models as compared to actual observations. Our
metallicity estimates also reproduce expected correlations with Galactic space
motions and H alpha emission line strengths, and return statistically identical
metallicities for M dwarfs within a common multiple system. Finally, we find
systematic residuals between our H2O-based spectral types and those derived
from optical spectral features with previously known sensitivity to stellar
metallicity, such as TiO, and identify the CaH1 index as a promising optical
index for diagnosing the metallicities of near-solar M dwarfs.

an expected linear relationship between time and the number of inferred neutral
mutations (the ""molecular clock""). However, at shorter time scales a number of
recent studies have observed an apparent acceleration in the rate of molecular
evolution.
  We study this apparent acceleration under a Jukes-Cantor model applied to a
randomly mating population, and show that, under the model, it arises as a
consequence of ignoring short term effects due to existing diversity within the
population. The acceleration can be accounted for by adding the correction term
h_0e^{-4mu*t/3} to the usual Jukes-Cantor formula p(t)=(3/4)(1-e^{-4mu*t/3}),
where h_0 is the expected heterozygosity in the population at time t=0. The
true mutation rate mu may then be recovered, even if h_0 is not known, by
estimating mu and h_0 simultaneously using least squares.
  Rate estimates made without the correction term (that is, incorrectly
assuming the population to be homogeneous) will result in a divergent rate
curve of the form mu_{div}=mu+C/t, so that the mutation rate appears to
approach infinity as the time scale approaches zero. While our quantitative
results apply only to the Jukes-Cantor model, it is reasonable to suppose that
the qualitative picture that emerges also applies to more complex models. Our
study therefore demonstrates the importance of properly accounting for any
ancestral diversity, as it may otherwise play a dominant role in rate
overestimation.

and the finite-dimensional irreducible modules for an algebra $\mathcal{A}$.
Let $\K$ denote an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let $V$
denote a vector space over $\K$ with finite positive dimension. A Leonard pair
on $V$ is an ordered pair of linear transformations in End$(V)$ such that for
each of these transformations there exists a basis for $V$ with respect to
which the matrix representing that transformation is diagonal and the matrix
representing the other transformation is irreducible tridiagonal. Whenever the
tridiagonal matrices are bipartite, the Leonard pair is said to be totally
bipartite. A mild weakening yields a type of Leonard pair said to be totally
almost bipartite. A Leonard pair is said to be totally B/AB whenever it is
totally bipartite or totally almost bipartite. The notion of a Leonard triple
and the corresponding notion of totally B/AB are similarly defined. There are
families of Leonard pairs and Leonard triples said to have Bannai/Ito type. The
Leonard pairs and Leonard triples of interest to us are totally B/AB and of
Bannai/Ito type.
  Let $\mathcal{A}$ denote the unital associative $\K$-algebra defined by
generators $x,y,z$ and relations\[xy+yx=2z,\qquad yz+zy=2x,\qquad
zx+xz=2y.\]The algebra $\mathcal{A}$ has a presentation involving generators
$x,y$ and relations\[x^{2}y+2xyx+yx^{2}=4y,\qquad y^{2}x+2yxy+xy^{2}=4x.\]
  In this paper we obtain the following results. We classify up to isomorphism
the totally B/AB Leonard pairs of Bannai/Ito type. We classify up to
isomorphism the totally B/AB Leonard triples of Bannai/Ito type. We classify up

show that these three classes of objects are essentially in one-to-one
correspondence, and describe these correspondences in detail.

systems (wiki), and others, are producing huge data collections that are very
repetitive. That is, there are few differences between the elements of the
collection. This fact makes the compressibility of the collection extremely
high. For example, a collection with all different versions of a Wikipedia
article can be compressed up to the 0.1% of its original space, using the
Lempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ77) compression scheme.
  Many of these repetitive collections handle huge amounts of text data. For
that reason, we require a method to store them efficiently, while providing the
ability to operate on them. The most common operations are the extraction of
random portions of the collection and the search for all the occurrences of a
given pattern inside the whole collection.
  A self-index is a data structure that stores a text in compressed form and
allows to find the occurrences of a pattern efficiently. On the other hand,
self-indexes can extract any substring of the collection, hence they are able
to replace the original text. One of the main goals when using these indexes is
to store them within main memory.
  In this thesis we present a scheme for random text extraction from text
compressed with a Lempel-Ziv parsing. Additionally, we present a variant of
LZ77, called LZ-End, that efficiently extracts text using space close to that
of LZ77.
  The main contribution of this thesis is the first self-index based on
LZ77/LZ-End and oriented to repetitive texts, which outperforms the state of
the art (the RLCSA self-index) in many aspects. Finally, we present a corpus of
repetitive texts, coming from several application domains. We aim at providing
a standard set of texts for research and experimentation, hence this corpus is

process in scalar field driven inflationary models, where reheating is achieved
by the decay of the coherently oscillating inflaton field. Specifically we
argue that the evolution after backreaction can seriously be altered by the
existence of these fluctuations. For example, in one model the coherence of the
inflaton oscillations is found to be completely lost in a very short time after
backreaction starts. Therefore we argue that entering a smooth phase in thermal
equilibrium is questionable in such models and reheating might destroy the
smoothness attained by inflation.

an interacting six site ring structure, which is threaded by a flux of $\pi$
and coupled to a left and a right lead. This ring structure is designed to have
a vanishing conductance for all gate voltages and temperatures provided
interactions are ignored. Therefore this system is an ideal testbed to study
the interplay of interaction and interference. First we find a Kondo type
resonance for rather large hopping parameter. Second, we find additional
resonance peaks which can be explained by a population blocking mechanism. To
this end we have to extend the Kubo approach within the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group method to handle degenerate states.

dense matter relevant to protoneutron stars. It is found that the shear
viscosities of neutrons, protons and electrons in neutrino-trapped matter are
of the same orders of magnitude as the corresponding shear viscosities in
neutrino-free matter. Above all, the shear viscosity due to neutrinos is higher
by several orders of magnitude than that of other species in neutrino-trapped
matter.
  Next we investigate the effect of shear viscosity in particular, neutrino
shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation rate of droplets of antikaon
condensed matter in protoneutron stars. The first-order phase transition from
hadronic matter to antikaon condensed matter is driven by the thermal
nucleation process. We compute the equation of state used for the calculation
of shear viscosity and thermal nucleation time within the relativistic mean
field model. Neutrino shear viscosity enhances the prefactor in the nucleation
rate by several orders of magnitude compared with the $T^4$ approximation of
earlier calculations. Consequently the thermal nucleation time in the $T^4$
approximation overestimates our result. Furthermore, the thermal nucleation of
an antikaon droplet might be possible in neutrino-trapped matter before
neutrino diffusion takes place.

dephosphorylation cycle (PdPC) and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase). We
show that the channel capacity is zero if and only if the free energy

between the channel capacity and free energy expenditure is observed. In terms
of the information theory, a linear signaling cascade consisting of multiple
steps of PdPC can function as a distributed ""multistage code"". With increasing

the concept of bipartite continuous variable entanglement. The non-classical
correlations (entanglement) between the two subsystems imply that the
observables of one subsystem are determined by the measurement choice on the
other, regardless of their distance. Nowadays, continuous variable entanglement
is regarded as an essential resource allowing for quantum enhanced measurement
resolution, the realization of quantum teleportation and quantum memories, or
the demonstration of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. These applications
rely on techniques to manipulate and detect coherences of quantum fields, the
quadratures. While in optics coherent homodyne detection of quadratures is a
standard technique, for massive particles a corresponding method was missing.
Here we report on the realization of an atomic analog to homodyne detection for
the measurement of matter-wave quadratures. The application of this technique
to a quantum state produced by spin-changing collisions in a Bose-Einstein
condensate reveals continuous variable entanglement, as well as the twin-atom
character of the state. With that we present a new system in which continuous
variable entanglement of massive particles is demonstrated. The direct
detection of atomic quadratures has applications not only in experimental
quantum atom optics but also for the measurement of fields in many-body systems
of massive particles.

and assign weights on them. Motivated by the studies on link prediction
algorithms, we propose a unified method to evaluate the network models via the
comparison of the likelihoods of the currently observed network driven by
different models, with an assumption that the higher the likelihood is, the
better the model is. We test our method on the real Internet at the Autonomous
System (AS) level, and the results suggest that the Generalized Linear
Preferential (GLP) model outperforms the Tel Aviv Network Generator (Tang),
while both two models are better than the Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) and
Erd\""os-R\'enyi (ER) models. Our method can be further applied in determining
the optimal values of parameters that correspond to the maximal likelihood.
Experiment indicates that the parameters obtained by our method can better
capture the characters of newly-added nodes and links in the AS-level Internet
than the original methods in the literature.

$z \ sim$ 7 is one of the great unsolved mysteries in cosmological structure
formation. One theory argues that they originate from the black holes of Pop
III stars at $z \sim$ 20 and then accrete at the Eddington limit down to the
epoch of reionization, which requires that they have constant access to rich
supplies of fuel. Because early numerical simulations suggested that Pop III
stars were $\gtrsim$ 100 M$_{\odot}$, the supermassive black hole seeds
considered up to now were 100 - 300 M$_{\odot}$. However, there is a growing
numerical and observational consensus that some Pop III stars were tens of
solar masses, not hundreds, and that 20 - 40 M$_{\odot}$ black holes may have
been much more plentiful at high redshift. However, we find that natal kicks
imparted to 20 - 40 M$_{\odot}$ Pop III BHs during formation eject them from
their halos and hence their fuel supply, precluding them from Eddington-limit
growth. Consequently, supermassive black holes are far less likely to form from
low-mass Pop III stars than from very massive ones.

a set of benchmark scenarios for phenomenological studies. On the technical

affecting in particular the Higgs and the neutralino sectors. Not only can they
shift the mass of the lightest neutralino by about 10 per-cent but also they
can change the nature of neutralinos and Higgs bosons in a significant way.

distribution dominated by two antipodal spots with different temperatures and
sizes. An emission line at 0.8 keV was also detected. We performed a very deep
(130 ks) observation with XMM-Newton, which allowed us to study in detail the
phase-resolved properties of RX J0822-4300. Our new data confirm the existence
of a narrow spectral feature, best modelled as an emission line, only seen in
the `Soft' phase interval - when the cooler region is best aligned to the line
of sight. Surprisingly, comparison of our recent observations to the older ones
yields evidence for a variation in the emission line component, which can be
modelled as a decrease in the central energy from ~0.80 keV in 2001 to ~0.73
keV in 2009--2010. The line could be generated via cyclotron scattering of
thermal photons in an optically thin layer of gas, or - alternatively - it
could originate in low-rate accretion by a debris disk. In any case, a
variation in energy, pointing to a variation of the magnetic field in the line
emitting region, cannot be easily accounted for.

populations. In particular, they can be used to discover and study a variety of
binary systems. A large number of binary lenses have already been found through
microlensing surveys and a few of these systems show strong evidence of orbital
motion on the timescale of the lensing event. We expect that more binary lenses
of this kind will be detected in the future. For binaries whose orbital period
is comparable to the event duration, the orbital motion can cause the lensing
signal to deviate drastically from that of a static binary lens. The most
striking property of such light curves is the presence of quasi- periodic
features, which are produced as the source traverses the same regions in the
rotating lens plane. These repeating features contain information about the
orbital period of the lens. If this period can be extracted, then much can be
learned about the lensing system even without performing time-consuming,
detailed light curve modeling. However, the relative transverse motion between
the source and the lens significantly complicates the problem of period
extraction. To resolve this difficulty, we present a modification of the
standard Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis. We test our method for four
representative binary lens systems and demonstrate its efficiency in correctly
extracting binary orbital periods.

within our Galactic disk. The submm continuum emission is confined to a narrow
range around the galactic plane, but shifted on average by ~0.07deg below the
plane. Source number counts show strong enhancements toward the Galactic
center, the spiral arms and toward prominent star-forming regions. Comparing
the distribution of ATLASGAL dust continuum emission to that of young
intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) derived from Spitzer
data, we find similarities as well as differences. In particular, the
distribution of submm dust continuum emission is significantly more confined to
the plane than the YSO distribution (FWHM of 0.7 and 1.1deg, corresponding to
mean physical scale heights of approximately 46 and 80pc, respectively). While
this difference may partly be caused by the large extinction from the dense
submm cores, gradual dispersal of stellar distributions after their birth could
also contribute to this effect. Compared to other tracers of Galactic

Motivated by the kinetics of RNA secondary structure formation, we are
interested in determining the asymptotic number of secondary structures that
are locally optimal, with respect to a particular energy model. In the Nussinov
energy model, where each base pair contributes -1 towards the energy of the
structure, locally optimal structures are exactly the saturated structures, for
which we have previously shown that asymptotically, there are $1.07427\cdot

$n$. In this paper, we consider the base stacking energy model, a mild variant
of the Nussinov model, where each stacked base pair contributes -1 toward the
energy of the structure. Locally optimal structures with respect to the base
stacking energy model are exactly those secondary structures, whose stems
cannot be extended. Such structures were first considered by Evers and
Giegerich, who described a dynamic programming algorithm to enumerate all
locally optimal structures. In this paper, we apply methods from enumerative
combinatorics to compute the asymptotic number of such structures.
Additionally, we consider analogous combinatorial problems for secondary
structures with annotated single-stranded, stacking nucleotides (dangles).

wireless communication offered by vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) with
sensing devices installed in vehicles. VSN creates a huge opportunity to extend
the road-side sensor infrastructure of existing traffic control systems. The
efficient use of the wireless communication medium is one of the basic issues
in VSN applications development. This paper introduces a novel method of
selective data collection for traffic control applications, which provides a
significant reduction in data amounts transmitted through VSN. The underlying
idea is to detect the necessity of data transfers on the basis of uncertainty
determination of the traffic control decisions. According to the proposed
approach, sensor data are transmitted from vehicles to the control node only at
selected time moments. Data collected in VSN are processed using on-line
traffic simulation technique, which enables traffic flow prediction,
performance evaluation of control strategies and uncertainty estimation. If
precision of the resulting information is insufficient, the optimal control
strategy cannot be derived without ambiguity. As a result the control decision
becomes uncertain and it is a signal informing that new traffic data from VSN
are necessary to provide more precise prediction and to reduce the uncertainty
of decision. The proposed method can be applied in traffic control systems of
different types e.g. traffic signals, variable speed limits, and dynamic route
guidance. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated in an experimental
study on traffic control at signalised intersection.

is a distorted map in which the areas of the countries are proportional to the

overall shape. We show that determining whether a given map and given

population in the present-day universe and they trace the low-level accreting
supermassive black holes. In order to probe the accretion and jet physical
properties in LLAGNs as a class, we model the broadband radio to X-rays
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 21 LLAGNs in low-ionization nuclear
emission-line regions (LINERs) with a coupled accretion-jet model. The
accretion flow is modeled as an inner ADAF outside of which there is a
truncated standard thin disk. We find that the radio emission is severely
underpredicted by ADAF models and is explained by the relativistic jet. The
origin of the X-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by three
distinct scenarios: the X-rays can be dominated by emission from the ADAF, or
the jet, or the X-rays can arise from a jet-ADAF combination in which both
components contribute to the emission with similar importance. For 3 objects
both the jet and ADAF fit equally well the X-ray spectrum and can be the
dominant source of X-rays whereas for 11 LLAGNs a jet-dominated model accounts
better than the ADAF-dominated model for the data. The individual and average
SED models that we computed can be useful for different studies of the nuclear
emission of LLAGNs. From the model fits, we estimate important parameters of
the central engine powering LLAGNs in LINERs, such as the mass accretion rate
and the mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power - relevant for studies of
the kinetic feedback from jets.

code CRASH. The simulations are run in a 35.12/h comoving Mpc box using a
variety of assumptions for the amplitude and power-law extreme-UV (EUV)
spectral index, alpha, of the ionising emissivity. We use an empirically
motivated prescription for ionising sources which ensures all of the models are
consistent with constraints on the Thomson scattering optical depth and the
hydrogen photo-ionisation rate at z=6. The inclusion of helium slightly delays
reionisation due to the small number of ionising photons which reionise neutral
helium instead of hydrogen. However, helium has a significant impact on the
thermal state of the IGM. Models with alpha=3 produce IGM temperatures at the
mean density at z=6 which are about 20 % higher compared to models without
helium photo-heating. Harder EUV indices produce even larger IGM temperature
boosts. A comparison to recent observational estimates of the IGM temperature
at z=5 - 6 suggests that hydrogen reionisation was primarily driven by pop-II
stellar sources with a soft EUV index, alpha<3. We also find that faint, as yet
undetected galaxies, characterised by a luminosity function with a steepening
faint-end slope and an increasing Lyman continuum escape fraction (fesc=0.5),
are required to reproduce the ionising emissivity used in our simulations at
z>6. Finally, we note there is some tension between recent observational
constraints which indicate the IGM is > 10% neutral by volume z=7, and
estimates of the ionising emissivity at z=6 which indicate only between 1 and 3
ionising photons are emitted per hydrogen atom over a Hubble time. This tension
may be alleviated by either a lower neutral fraction at z=7 or an IGM which
still remains a few % neutral by volume at z=6.

condense into a 1/4 Laughlin state. The quasiparticle excitations of the

exact states of the finite size systems at $N_{\phi} = 2N-3$. The near unity
overlaps are obtained in the lowest Landau level, while the moderate overlaps

core-collapse supernovae on \nu p-process nucleosynthesis. Our results are
based on hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino wind ejecta. Motivated by
recent two-dimensional wind simulations, we vary the dynamical evolution during
the \nu p-process and show that final abundances strongly depend on the
temperature evolution. When the expansion is very fast, there is not enough
time for antineutrino absorption on protons to produce enough neutrons to
overcome the \beta-decay waiting points and no heavy elements beyond A=64 are
produced. The wind termination shock or reverse shock dramatically reduces the
expansion speed of the ejecta. This extends the period during which matter
remains at relatively high temperatures and is exposed to high neutrino fluxes,
thus allowing for further (p,\gamma) and (n,p) reactions to occur and to
synthesize elements beyond iron. We find that the \nu p-process starts to
efficiently produce heavy elements only when the temperature drops below ~3 GK.
At higher temperatures, due to the low alpha separation energy of 60Zn
(S_{\alpha} = 2.7 MeV) the reaction 59Cu(p,\alpha)56Ni is faster than the
reaction 59Cu(p,\gamma)60Zn. This results in the closed NiCu cycle that we
identify and discuss here for the first time. We also investigate the late
phase of the \nu p-process when the temperatures become too low to maintain
proton captures. Depending on the late neutron density, the evolution to
stability is dominated by \beta decays or by (n,\gamma) reactions. In the
latter case, the matter flow can even reach the neutron-rich side of stability
and the isotopic composition of a given element is then dominated by
neutron-rich isotopes.

that the construction of Roux in [11] is the only attempt in the literature to
define generalized Brownian motion related to parabolic systems with coupled
second order terms, where Lam\'e's equation of elastic mechanics is considered
as an example. In this paper we provide an exact construction from a logical

generalized Brownian motion is derived which is a useful tool in order to
design probabilistic algorithms for Cauchy problems and initial-boundary value

when the entangling surface is a black hole horizon, the fluctuations of which
cause necessarily the fluctuations in the spacetime geometry. In the second

out for the random entangling surfaces embedded in flat Minkowski spacetime. In

holes predicted by General Relativity, although a definite proof of their
actual nature is still lacking. The most massive objects in AGN ($M \sim 10^9
M_\odot$) seem to have a high radiative efficiency ($\eta \sim 0.4$) and a
moderate mass accretion rate ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.3$). The high
radiative efficiency could suggest they are very rapidly-rotating black holes.
The moderate luminosity could indicate that their accretion disk is
geometrically thin. If so, these objects could be excellent candidates to test
the Kerr black hole hypothesis. An accurate measurement of the radiative
efficiency of an individual AGN may probe the geometry of the space-time around
the black hole candidate with a precision comparable to the one achievable with
future space-based gravitational-wave detectors like LISA. A robust evidence of
the existence of a black hole candidate with $\eta > 0.32$ and accreting from a
thin disk may be interpreted as an indication of new physics. For the time
being, there are several issues to address before using AGN to test the Kerr
paradigm, but the approach seems to be promising and capable of providing
interesting results before the advent of gravitational wave astronomy.

The conventional approach to determining a suitable number of components is to
compare different mixture models using penalized log-likelihood criteria such

parameter estimation and model selection simultaneously. A variational
approximation is described where the variational lower bound and parameter
updates are in closed form, allowing fast evaluation. A new variational greedy
algorithm is developed for model selection and learning of the mixture
components. This approach allows an automatic initialization of the algorithm
and returns a plausible number of mixture components automatically. In cases of
weak identifiability of certain model parameters, we use hierarchical centering
to reparametrize the model and show empirically that there is a gain in
efficiency by variational algorithms similar to that in MCMC algorithms.
Related to this, we prove that the approximate rate of convergence of
variational algorithms by Gaussian approximation is equal to that of the
corresponding Gibbs sampler which suggests that reparametrizations can lead to
improved convergence in variational algorithms as well.

relies on recognizing structure in sequences of space-time 171\AA\ images using

events and non-events are distinctive enough to be separated using a Support

The histograms of the sizes in both EUVI and AIA follow a steep power law with
slope about -5. The AIA slope extends to smaller sizes before turning over. The

(5 Fe 3d orbitals filled by 6 electrons) is located on the foot of an
unexpectedly large dome of correlated electron matter centered at the Mott
insulator at d5 (namely, half filling). This is based on the many-variable
variational Monte-Carlo results for ab initio low-energy models derived by the
downfolding. The d5 Mott proximity extends to subsequent emergence of
incoherent metals, orbital differentiations due to the Mott physics and
Hund's-rule coupling, followed by antiferromagnetic quantum criticality, in
quantitative accordance with available experiments.

holes in $\mathcal{N}=2$, $d=4$ supergravity, we investigate the stability of a
near-extremal D0-D4 black hole in the probe limit, when the parameters of the
black hole solution lie within a certain regime. We determine whether it is
possible to form bound states of this ""core"" non-extremal black hole with BPS
probe particles, and whether it is possible for the ""core"" black hole to decay
by the emission of such BPS probes either to a local minimum of the probe
potential, or spatial infinity. We first carry out a qualitative analysis of
the probe potential to determine when quantum tunneling of probes from the
black hole is possible. We then find the wavefunction of the scattered probe by
using the WKB approximation to solve the Dirac equation in the black hole
background, and use this solution to compute the tunneling amplitude.

that the asymptotic behavior depends on the Fourier expansion of the
quasi-periodic coupling of the family. The theory developed here provides a
theoretical explanation to the behavior that can be observed numerically.

the chance to enter new uninfected host cells. The model, and in particular the
probability of the virus population surviving, is analyzed using the theory of

y_CP is the deviation from unity of the ratio of effective lifetimes measured
in D0 decays to the CP eigenstate K+K- with respect to decays to the Cabibbo
favoured mode K-\pi+. The result measured using data collected by LHCb in 2010,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 29 pb^-1, is y_CP =
(5.5+/-6.3_{stat}+/-4.1_{syst}) x 10^-3. The parameter A_\Gamma\ is the
asymmetry of effective lifetimes measured in decays of D0 and anti-D0 mesons to
K+K-. The result is A_\Gamma\ = (-5.9+/-5.9_{stat}+/-2.1_{syst}) x 10^-3. A
data-driven technique is used to correct for lifetime-biasing effects.

high-energy pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. This is an interesting
process for charged Higgs discovery, or exclusion, since the production cross
section could depend strongly on the model, offering potential discriminating
power between supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with minimal or
extended Higgs sectors. We compute the cross section for this process in the
next-to-minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), at the tree level for
quark-quark scattering and at one-loop level for gluon-gluon scattering. The
most important corrections beyond leading order are taken into account using an
improved Born approximation. We find that the pp \to H^\pm W^\mp cross section
can be resonantly enhanced by up to an order of magnitude over its MSSM value
(both for \sqrt{s}=7 TeV and 14 TeV) through the contributions of heavy,
neutral, singlet-dominated Higgs bosons appearing in the s-channel. Since such
Higgs mass configurations are normally not possible in the MSSM, the
observation of associated H^\pm W^\mp production at the LHC could provide a
striking, although indirect, signature of a more complicated Higgs sector.

is determined so that the susceptibility should fulfill this exact sum-rule, in
which fluctuations belonging to different symmetries couple at finite momentum.
It is demonstrated that the mode coupling between d-wave and s-wave pairing
fluctuations leads to suppression of the d-wave fluctuation near the Mott

three different kinds of particles: bradyons, luxons and tachyons. Bradyons
have non-zero mass and hence always travel slower than light. Luxons are
particles with zero mass, like the photon, and they always travel with
invariant velocity. Tachyons are hypothetical superluminal particles that
always move faster than light. The existence of bradyons and luxons is firmly
established, while the tachyons were never reliably observed. In quantum field
theory, the appearance of tachyonic degrees of freedom indicates vacuum
instability rather than a real existence of the faster-than-light particles.
However, recent controversial claims of the OPERA experiment about superluminal
neutrinos triggered a renewed interest in superluminal particles. Driven by a
striking analogy of the old Frenkel-Kontorova model of a dislocation dynamics
to the theory of relativity, we conjecture in this note a remarkable
possibility of existence of the fourth type of particles, elvisebrions, which
can be superluminal. The characteristic feature of elvisebrions, distinguishing
them from tachyons, is that they are outside the realm of special relativity
and their energy remains finite (or may even turn to zero) when the elvisebrion
velocity approaches the light velocity.

defined. Our approach avoids the need to approximate intractable integrals

linear complexity in the sample size. Thus, we can efficiently perform value

we learn the conditional distribution representation from a training sample,

convergence of our approach either to the optimal policy, or to the closest

well-removed from equilibrium, explicit asymptotic and quasi-steady-state
approximations can give algebraically-stabilized integration schemes that rival
standard implicit methods in accuracy and speed for extremely stiff systems.
However, we also showed that these explicit methods remain accurate but are no
longer competitive in speed as the network approaches equilibrium. In this
paper we analyze this failure and show that it is associated with the presence
of fast equilibration timescales that neither asymptotic nor quasi-steady-state
approximations are able to remove efficiently from the numerical integration.
Based on this understanding, we develop a partial equilibrium method to deal
effectively with the approach to equilibrium and show that explicit asymptotic
methods, combined with the new partial equilibrium methods, give an integration
scheme that plausibly can deal with the stiffest networks, even in the approach
to equilibrium, with accuracy and speed competitive with that of implicit
methods. Thus we demonstrate that such explicit methods may offer alternatives
to implicit integration of even extremely stiff systems, and that these methods
may permit integration of much larger networks than have been possible before
in a number of fields.

Duffing flows (GCFL), which is a natural extension of the globally coupled
logistic map lattice (GCML), is constructed. It is observed that GCFL inherits
various intriguing properties of GCML and that universality at the level of
elements is thus lifted to that of systems. Phase diagrams of GCFL are
determined, which are essentially the same with those of GCML. Similar to the
two-clustered periodic attractor of GCML, the GCFL two-clustered attractor
exhibits a successive period-doubling with an increase of population imbalance

attractors that originates from the symmetry in the Duffing equation is
investigated in detail.

prefers to occupy the tetrahedral site, which is coordinated with four Cu
cations, in all three charge states (+1, neutral, and -1); (2) H will bind with
a Cu vacancy and form an electrically active H-VCu defect complex, which is
amphoteric with (+/0) and (0/-)transition levels at Ev + 0.1 and Ev + 1.1 eV,
respectively. However, these two conclusions contradict two generally observed
behaviors of H in oxides: (i) cationic H usually binds with an O atom, forming
a single O-H bond, while the anionic H usually binds with cations with
multi-coordination; (ii) H usually passivates cation vacancies in oxides. In
this Comment, we explicitly show that with charge state +1, H prefers to bind
with a single O anion rather than with four Cu cations and that H-VCu does not
induce any defect levels inside the band gap.

density embodied by photons. The density of free space is in balance with the
