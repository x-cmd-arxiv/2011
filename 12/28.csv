Porb of 60.85 d from optical S II and Ne I absorption lines observed in this

light-curve during our spectroscopic monitoring reveals two brightness minima
(\Delta V~0.1 mag.) over the orbital period due to partial eclipses at an
orbital inclination angle of ~70 degrees. We find a clear correlation between
the orbital phases and the detailed shapes of optical and near-IR P Cygni-type
line profiles of He I, Si II, and double- or triple-peaked stationary cores of
prominent Fe II emission lines. A preliminary 3-D radiative transfer model
computed with Wind3D shows that the periodic P Cygni line profile variability
results from an asymmetric common-envelope wind with enhanced density (or line
opacity) in the vicinity of the LBV primary. The variable orientation of the
inner LBV wind region due to the orbital motion produces variable P Cygni line
profiles (with wind velocities of ~200 km/s) between orbital phases \phi = 0.65

period later around \phi = 0.15 to 0.35. We do not observe optical or near-IR

of the previous work which assumed a collision channel. Specifically, the pilot

neutron-star binary systems is an important science goal for ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors. In addition to emitting gravitational-waves at
frequencies that span the most sensitive bands of the LIGO and Virgo detectors,
these sources are also amongst the most likely to produce an electromagnetic
counterpart to the gravitational-wave emission. A joint detection of the
gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals would provide a powerful new
probe for astronomy.
  Methods. During the period between September 19 and October 20, 2010, the
first low-latency search for gravitational-waves from binary inspirals in LIGO
and Virgo data was conducted. The resulting triggers were sent to
electromagnetic observatories for followup. We describe the generation and
processing of the low-latency gravitational-wave triggers. The results of the
electromagnetic image analysis will be described elsewhere.
  Results. Over the course of the science run, three gravitational-wave
triggers passed all of the low-latency selection cuts. Of these, one was
followed up by several of our observational partners. Analysis of the
gravitational-wave data leads to an estimated false alarm rate of once every
6.4 days, falling far short of the requirement for a detection based solely on
gravitational-wave data.

tree-decomposable linkages in 2D. By employing the notion Cayley configuration
space, i.e., a set of intervals of realizable distance-values for an
independent non-edge, we answer the following. (1) How to measure the
complexity of the configuration space and efficiently compute that of low
algebraic complexity? (2) How to restrict the Cayley configuration space to be
a single interval? (3) How to efficiently obtain continuous motion paths
between realizations? (4) How to bijectively represent of the Cartesian
realization space as a curve in an ambient space of minimum dimension? (5) How
robust is the complexity measure (1) and how to efficiently classify linkages
according to it?
  In Part I of this paper, we deal with problems (1)-(4) by introducing the
notions of (a) Cayley size, the number of intervals in the Cayley configuration
space, (b) Cayley computational complexity of computing the interval endpoints,
and (c) Cayley (algebraic) complexity of describing the interval endpoints.
Specifically (i) We give an algorithm to find the interval endpoints of a
Cayley configuration spac. For graphs with low Cayley complexity, we give the
following. (ii) A natural, minimal set of local orientations, whose
specification guarantees Cayley size of 1 and $O(|V|^2)$ Cayley computational
complexity. Specifying fewer local orientations results in a superpolynomial
blow-up of both Cayley size and computational complexity, provided P is
different from NP. (iii) An algorithm--for generic linkages--to find a path of
continuous motion (provided exists) between two given realizations, in time
linear in a natural measure of path length. (iv) A canonical bijective

  II: Combinatorial Characterization of Complexity",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We continue to study Cayley configuration spaces of 1-dof linkages in 2D
begun in Part I of this paper, i.e. the set of attainable lengths for a
non-edge. In Part II, we focus on the algebraic complexity of describing
endpoints of the intervals in the set, i.e., the Cayley complexity.
  Specifically, We focus on Cayley configuration spaces of a natural class of
1-dof linkages, called 1-dof tree-decomposable linkages. The underlying graphs
G satisfy the following: for some base non-edge f, G \cup f is
quadratic-radically solvable (QRS), meaning that G \cup f is minimally rigid,
and given lengths \bar{l} of all edges, the corresponding linkage (G \cup f,
\bar{l}) can be simply realized by ruler and compass starting from f. It is
clear that the Cayley complexity only depends on the graph G and possibly the
non-edge f. Here we ask whether the Cayley complexity depends on the choice of
a base non-edge f. We answer this question in the negative, thereby showing
that low Cayley complexity is a property of the graph G (independent of the
non-edge f).
  Then, we give a simple characterization of graphs with low Cayley complexity,
leading to an efficient algorithmic characterization, i.e. an efficient
algorithm for recognizing such graphs.
  Next, we show a surprising result that (graph) planarity is equivalent to low
Cayley complexity for a natural subclass of 1-dof triangle-decomposable graphs.
While this is a finite forbidden minor graph characterization of low Cayley
complexity, we provide counterexamples showing impossibility of such finite
forbidden minor characterizations when the above subclass is enlarged.

compounds impact multiple targets and pathways, traditional methods for
analyzing structure-function relationships are not comprehensive enough.
Therefore more advanced integrative models are needed for predicting biological
effects elicited by specific chemical features. As a step towards creating such
computational links we developed a data-driven chemical systems biology
approach to comprehensively study the relationship of 76 structural
3D-descriptors (VolSurf, chemical space) of 1159 drugs with the gene expression
responses (biological space) they elicited in three cancer cell lines. The
analysis covering 11350 genes was based on data from the Connectivity Map. We
decomposed these biological response profiles into components, each linked to a
characteristic chemical descriptor profile. The integrated quantitative
analysis of the chemical and biological spaces was more informative about
protein-target based drug similarity than either dataset separately. We
identified ten major components that link distinct VolSurf features across
multiple compounds to specific biological activity types. For example,
component 2 (hydrophobic properties) strongly links to DNA damage response,
while component 3 (hydrogen bonding) connects to metabolic stress. Individual
structural and biological features were often linked to one cell line only,
such as leukemia cells (HL-60) specifically responding to cardiac glycosides.
In summary, our approach identified specific chemical structures shared across
multiple drugs causing distinct biological responses. The decoding of such
systematic chemical-biological relationships is necessary to build better
models of drug effects, including unidentified types of molecular properties
with strong biological effects.

degradation of the catalyst with changes in particle/inter-particle
morphologies, particle-support interactions and the near-surface chemical
composition. We found that, aging of the catalysts under normal fuel cell
operating conditions (potential scans from +0.6 V to +1.0 V for 30,000 cycles)
gives rise to coarsening of the nanoparticles, mainly through coalescence,
which in turn leads to the loss of performance. The observed coalescence events
were found to be the result of nanoparticle migration on the carbon support

nanocatalyst degradation occurs in proton exchange membrane fuel cells

lot of estimates about their valuation have been circulating, without any
specifics given about the methodology or assumptions used to obtain those
numbers. To bring more substance to the debate, we propose a two-tiered
approach. First, we introduce a new model to forecast the global user base of
Zynga, based on the analysis of the individual dynamics of its major games.
Next, we model the revenues per user using a logistic growth function, a
standard model for growth in competition. This leads to bracket the valuation
of Zynga using three different scenarios (base one, optimistic and very
optimistic): 4.17 billion USD in the base case, 5.16 billion in the high growth
and 7.02 billion in the extreme growth scenario respectively. Thus, only the
unlikely extreme growth scenario could potentially justify today's 6.6 billion
USD valuation of Zynga. This suggests that Zynga at its IPO has been
overpriced.

(LSS), and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) have confirmed the presence of
what is called dark energy - the cause of accelerating expansion of the
Universe. They have also measured its density as well as the value of other
cosmological parameters according to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model with
few percent uncertainties. Next generation of surveys should allow to constrain
this model with better precisions, or distinguish between a LCDM and
alternative models such as modified gravity and (interacting)-quintessence
models. In this work we parametrize both homogeneous and anisotropic components
of matter density in the context of interacting dark energy models with the
goal of discriminating between f(R) modified gravity and its generalizations,
and interacting dark energy models, for which we also propose a
phenomenological description of energy-momentum conservation equations inspired
by particle physics. It is based on the fact that the simplest interactions
between particles/fields are elastic scattering and decay. The parametrization
of growth rate proposed here is nonetheless general and can be used to
constrain other interactions. As an example of applications, we present an
order of magnitude estimation of the accuracy of the measurement of these
parameters using Euclid and Planck surveys data, and leave a better estimation
to a dedicated work.

separated into discrete groups, and the probability of an edge existing between

derive expressions for the entropy of stochastic blockmodel ensembles. We
consider several ensemble variants, including the traditional model as well as
the newly introduced degree-corrected version [Karrer et al. Phys. Rev. E 83,

the block structure. The imposed degree sequence is implemented both as ""soft""

ensemble. We also consider generalizations to multigraphs and directed graphs.
We illustrate one of many applications of this measure by directly deriving a
log-likelihood function from the entropy expression, and using it to infer
latent block structure in observed data. Due to the general nature of the
ensembles considered, the method works well for ensembles with intrinsic degree
correlations (i.e. with entropic origin) as well as extrinsic degree
correlations, which go beyond the block structure.

technique of random catalogue generation was developed for this purpose, that
allows to take into account the original homogeneity of the survey without
knowledge of its imaging mask. When averaged over photometrical redshifts
0.8<z_phot<2.2 the 2pCF of photometrically selected quasars is found to be
approximated well with the power law w(\theta)=(\theta/\theta_0)^{-\alpha} with
\theta_0=4"".5+/-1"".4, \alpha=0.94+/-0.06 over the range 1'<\theta<40'. It
agrees well with previous results by Myers et al. (2006,2007), obtained for
samples of NBCKDE quasars with similar mean z_phot, but averaged over broader
z_phot range. The parameters of the deprojected 2pCF averaged over the same
z_phot range and modelled with a power law \xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}, are
r_0=7.81^{+1.18}_{-1.16} Mpc/h, \gamma=1.94+/-0.06, which are in perfect
agreement with previous results from spectroscopic surveys. We confirm the
evidence for an increase of the clustering amplitude with z, and find no
evidence for luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering. The latter is
consistent with the models of the quasar formation, in which bright and faint
quasars are assumed to be similar sources, hosted by dark matter halos of
similar masses, but observed at different stages of their evolution. Comparison
of our results with studies of the X-ray selected AGNs with similar z shows
that the clustering amplitude of optically selected quasars is similar to that
of X-ray selected quasars, but lower than that of samples of all X-ray selected
AGNs. As the samples of all X-ray selected AGNs contain AGNs of both types, our
result serves as an evidence for different types of AGNs to reside in different

found that the two factors with stronger dependency on the authors were the

been used as important security measures for key stream sequence strength in

  First, for $k=2,3$, the complete counting functions on the $k$-error linear

shocks, nuclear rings, and nuclear spirals. These substructure may affect star
formation, and control the activity of a central black hole (BH) by determining
the mass inflow rate. We investigate the formation and properties of such
substructures using high-resolution, grid-based hydrodynamic simulations. The
gaseous medium is assumed to be infinitesimally-thin, isothermal, and
non-self-gravitating. The stars and dark matter are represented by a static
gravitational potential with four components: a stellar disk, the bulge, a
central BH, and the bar. To investigate various galactic environments, we vary
the gas sound speed c_s as well as the mass of the central BH M_BH. Once the
flow has reached a quasi-steady state, off-axis shocks tend to move closer to
the bar major axis as c_s increases. Nuclear rings shrink in size with
increasing c_s, but are independent of M_BH, suggesting that ring position is
not determined by the Lindblad resonances. Rings in low-c_s models are narrow
since they are occupied largely by gas on x2-orbits and well decoupled from
nuclear spirals, while they become broad because of large thermal perturbations
in high-c_s models. Nuclear spirals persist only when either c_s is small or
M_BH is large; they would otherwise be destroyed completely by the ring
material on eccentric orbits. The shape and strength of nuclear spirals depend
sensitively on c_s and M_BH such that they are leading if both c_s and M_BH are
small, weak trailing if c_s is small and M_BH is large, and strong trailing if
both c_s and M_BH are large. While the mass inflow rate toward the nucleus is
quite small in low-c_s models because of the presence of a narrow nuclear ring,
it becomes larger than 0.01 Msun/yr when c_s is large, providing a potential
explanation of nuclear activity in Seyfert galaxies.

smooth function on M\K that vanishes on all faces of M in a controlled way.
Using tools from analysis on non-compact Riemannian manifolds, we show that the
computation of the index of P reduces to the computation of the index of an
elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order zero on M_0 that is a
multiplication operator at infinity. The index formula for P can then be
obtained from earlier results. The proof also yields similar index formulas for

depict the non-Newtonian behaviour of the fluid. The model is formulated and
analyzed with the specific aim of exploring some important information
concerning the movement of food bolus through the esophagus. The analysis has
been carried out by using lubrication theory. The study is particularly
suitable for cases where the Reynolds number is small. The esophagus is treated
as a circular tube through which the transport of food bolus takes places by
periodic contraction of the esophageal wall. Variation of different variables
concerned with the transport phenomena such as pressure, flow velocity,
particle trajectory and reflux are investigated for a single wave as well as
for a train of periodic peristaltic waves. Locally variable pressure is seen to
be highly sensitive to the flow index `n'. The study clearly shows that
continuous fluid transport for Newtonian/rheological fluids by wave train
propagation is much more effective than widely spaced single wave propagation
in the case of peristaltic movement of food bolus in the esophagus.

related to remarkable similarity of quasar spectra in UV-optical range. But
despite of general similarity in spectral shapes, they differ in several
parameters, one of which is the spectral index. In the present paper we study
the possible effects, related to neglect of this difference. We compiled 16
composite spectra from subsamples of individual SDSS DR7 quasar spectra with
different spectral indices \alpha_\lambda within the wavelength range 1270-1480
\AA, and show that (i) the redshifts measured for a test sample of high

to be systematically higher than those calculated with a traditional template,
compiled from spectra with different \alpha_\lambda, with 1.5 times smaller
errors in the former case; (ii) the difference in \alpha_\lambda in individual
spectra used for compilation of composites can yield the mean transmission
uncertainty up to 20%; (iii) a number of emission lines indistinguishable in
ordinary composites, but seen in individual high-resolution spectra, can be
detected in such composites. It is also shown, that there is no dependence of
\alpha_\lambda on quasar luminosity in SDSS u, g, r and i bands, and

is, the price level in the limit-order book (LOB) and the position in the queue
at each price level. We study the profiles of these two order cancellation
positions through rebuilding the limit-order book using the order flow data of
23 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in the year 2003. We
find that the profiles of relative price levels where cancellations occur obey
a log-normal distribution. After normalizing the relative price level by
removing the factor of order numbers stored at the price level, we find that
the profiles exhibit a power-law scaling behavior on the right tails for both
buy and sell orders. When focusing on the order cancellation positions in the
queue at each price level, we find that the profiles increase rapidly in the
front of the queue, and then fluctuate around a constant value till the end of
the queue. These profiles are similar for different stocks. In addition, the
profiles of cancellation positions can be fitted by an exponent function for

this redshift range. We detected CO emission from six out of nine galaxies,
whose CO luminosity (L_CO') ranges (1.09-10.8)\times10^9 K km s^{-1} pc^2.
These are the infrared (IR) dimmest galaxies that have ever been detected in CO
at z~0.1 to date. They follow the L_CO'-L_IR relation among local spiral
galaxies, Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs), Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies
(ULIRGs) and Sub-millimeter Galaxies (SMGs). Their L_CO' and L_IR are higher
than that of local spiral galaxies which have been detected in CO so far, and
L_IR/L'_CO, which is a measure of star formation efficiency, is comparable to
or slightly higher than that of local ones. This result suggests that these
galaxies are forming stars more actively than local spirals galaxies simply
because they have more fuel.

described by a Hamiltonian that has spatial periodicity. Specifically, we
consider a spin-1/2 chain with equal xx and yy couplings and subject to a
periodically varying magnetic field in the z direction or, equivalently, a
tight-binding model of spinless fermions with a periodic local chemical
potential, having period 2q, where q is a natural number. For a linear quench
of the magnetic field strength (or potential strength) at rate 1/\tau across a
quantum critical point, we find that the density of defects thereby produced
scales as 1/\tau^{q/(q+1)}, deviating from the 1/\sqrt{\tau} scaling that is
ubiquitous to a range of systems. We analyze this behavior by mapping the
low-energy physics of the system to a set of fermionic two-level systems
labeled by the lattice momentum k undergoing a non-linear quench as well as by
performing numerical simulations. We also find that if the magnetic field is a
superposition of different periods, the power law depends only on the smallest
period for very large values of \tau although it may exhibit a cross-over at
intermediate values of \tau. Finally, for the case where a zz coupling is also
present in the spin chain, or equivalently, where interactions are present in
the fermionic system, we argue that the power associated with the scaling law
depends on a combination of q and interaction strength.

determine whether it is a signature of a resonance are presented. The analysis
is carried out in an effective Lagrangian approach which includes Pomeron and
(\pi,\eta) exchanges in the t channel, and contributions from the s- and
u-channel excitations of a postulated nucleon resonance. In addition to the
differential cross sections, we use the nine spin-density matrix elements
(SDME) as recently measured, instead of the phi-meson decay angular
distributions which depend only on six SDMEs as was done before, to constrain
the resonance parameters. We conclude that indeed the nonmonotonic behavior,
along with the other experimental data as reported by LEPS, can only be
explained with an assumption of the excitation of a resonance of spin 3/2, as
previously reported. However, both parities can account for the data equally
well with almost identical mass of 2.08 +/- 0.04 GeV and width of 0.501 +/-
0.117 and 0.570 +/- 0.159 for 3/2^+ and 3/2^-, respectively. The ratio of the
helicity amplitudes A_{1/2}/A_{3/2} calculated from the resulting coupling
constants differs in sign from that of the known D_{13}(2080). More
experimental data on single and double polarization observables are needed to
resolve the parity. We further find that with an assumption of large values of
the OZI-evading parameters x_{OZI} = 12 for J^P = 3/2^- and x_{OZI} = 9 for J^P
= 3/2^+, the discrepancy between the recent experimental data on \omega-meson
photoproduction and theoretical model can be considerably reduced. We argue
that the large value of x_{OZI} indicates that the postulated resonance
contains non-negligible amount of strangeness content.

scheduling system. A scheduling unit block consists of contiguous multiple
subcarriers. Users are scheduled based on their block average throughput in a
proportional fair way. The multiuser diversity gain increases with the degree
and dynamic range of channel fluctuations. %Lack of diversity in a limited
frequency selective channel may decrease the sum rate. However, a decrease of
the block average throughput in a too much selective channel may lessen the sum
rate as well. In this paper, we first study optimal channel selectivity in view
of maximizing the maximum of the block average throughput of an arbitrary user.
Based on this study, we then propose a method to determine a per-user optimal
cyclic delay when cyclic delay diversity (CDD) is used to enhance the sum rate
by increasing channel selectivity for a limited fluctuating channel. We show
that the proposed technique achieves better performance than a conventional
fixed cyclic delay scheme and that the throughput is very close to the optimal
sum rate possible with CDD.

it is extremely challenging to generate giant cross-Kerr nonlinearities. In
recent years, much effort has been made to perform multiqubit gates via weak
XKNLs. However, the required nonlinearity strengths are still difficult to
achieve in the experiment. We here propose an XKNL-based scheme for realizing a
two-photon polarization-parity gate, a universal two-qubit gate, in which the
required strength of the nonlinearity could be orders of magnitude weaker than
those required for previous schemes. The scheme utilizes a ring cavity fed by a
coherent state as a quantum information bus which interacts with a path mode of
the two polarized photons (qubits). The XKNL effect makes the bus pick up a
phase shift dependent on the photon number of the path mode. Even when the
potential phase shifts are very small they can be effectively measured using
photon-number resolving detectors, which accounts for the fact that our scheme
can work in the regime of tiny XKNL. The measurement outcome reveals the parity
(even parity or odd parity) of the two polarization qubits.

Poincar\'e patch of the 5-dimensional Anti-de Sitter universe. We construct a
large family of unitary dynamics with respect to some high order energies that
are conserved and positive. These dynamics are associated with asymptotic
conditions on the conformal time-like boundary of the universe. This result
does not contradict the statement of Breitenlohner-Freedman that the
hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint in L2 and thus accordingly the dynamics
is uniquely determined. The key point is the introduction of a new Hilbert
functional framework that contains the massless graviton which is not
normalizable in L2. Then the hamiltonian is not essentially self-adjoint in
this new space and admits a lot of positive self-adjoint extensions.

approximation for identical bosons and fermions in an external confining field.
We use the canonical partition function where only energies and their
degeneracies enter. The number of states of given energy and symmetry is found
by separating the center of mass motion, and counting the remaining states of
given symmetry and excitation energy of the relative motion. The oscillator
frequencies that enter the harmonic Hamiltonian can be derived from realistic
model parameters and the method corresponds to an effective interaction
approach based on harmonic interactions. To demonstrate the method, we apply it
to systems in two dimensions. Numerical calculations are compared to a brute
force method that is considerably more computationally intensive.

acyclic graph. This is a model of a discrete pregeometry on a microscopic
scale. The dynamics is a stochastic sequential growth of the graph. New
vertexes of the graph are added one by one. The probability of each step
depends on the structure of existed graph. The particular case of dynamics is
based on binary alternatives. Each directed path is considered as a sequence of
outcomes of binary alternatives. The probabilities of a stochastic sequential
growth are functions of these paths. The goal is to describe physical objects
as some self-organized structures of the graph. A problem to find
self-organized structures is discussed.

results, it is shown that, while XMCD signals only due to paramagnetic
Mn$^{2+}$ ions were observed in ZnO:Mn, nonmagnetic, paramagnetic and
ferromagnetic Mn$^{2+}$ ions coexist in ZnO:Mn,N. XMCD signals of ZnO:Mn,N
revealed that the localized Mn$^{2+}$ ground state and Mn$^{2+}$ state
hybridized with ligand hole coexisted, implying $p$-$d$ exchange coupling. In
the valence-band spectra, spectral weight near the Fermi level was suppressed,
suggesting that interaction between magnetic moments in ZnO:Mn,N has localized
nature.
