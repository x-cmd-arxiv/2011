pathways. Such models are a coarse-grained description of the underlying
microscopic dynamics and can be considered mesoscopic. The level of
coarse-graining is to a certain extend arbitrary since it depends on the
resolution of accomodating measurements. Here, we present a way to simplify
such stochastic descriptions, which preserves both the meso-micro and the
meso-macro connection. The former is achieved by demanding locality, the latter
by considering cycles on the network of states. Using single- and multicycle
examples we demonstrate how our new method preserves fluctuations of
observables much better than na\""ive approaches.

for EUV channels of narrow-band imagers on board space telescopes, which
provide spectacular intensity images of the outer solar atmosphere. Since the
magnetic field information is encoded in the polarization of the spectral line
radiation, it is important to investigate whether the He II line radiation from
the solar disk can be polarized, along with its magnetic sensitivity. Here we
report some theoretical predictions concerning the linear polarization signals
produced by scattering processes in this strong emission line of the solar
transition region, taking into account radiative transfer and the Hanle effect
caused by the presence of organized and random magnetic fields. We find that
the fractional polarization amplitudes are significant (${\sim}1%$), even when
considering the wavelength-integrated signals. Interestingly, the scattering
polarization of the Ly-alpha line of He II starts to be sensitive to the Hanle
effect for magnetic strengths B>100 G (i.e., for magnetic strengths of the
order of and larger than the Hanle saturation field of the hydrogen Ly-alpha
line at 1216 \AA). We therefore propose simultaneous observations of the
scattering polarization in both Ly-alpha lines to facilitate magnetic field
measurements in the upper solar chromosphere. Even the development of a
narrow-band imaging polarimeter for the He II 304 \AA\ line alone would be
already of great diagnostic value for probing the solar transition region.

crossing of the jet from one side of the line of sight to the other during a
softer and longer term swing of the inner jet. Modulating such long term swing,
our images also show for the first time a prominent erratic wobbling behavior
of the innermost ~0.4mas of the jet with fluctuations in position angle of up
to ~40 deg. over time scales ~2yr. This is accompanied by highly superluminal
motions along non-radial trajectories, which reflect the remarkable
non-ballistic nature of the jet plasma on these scales. The erratic nature and
short time scales of the observed behavior rules out scenarios such as binary
black hole systems, accretion disk precession, and interaction with the ambient
medium as possible origins of the phenomenon on the scales probed by our
observations, although such processes may cause longer-term modulation of the
jet direction. We propose that variable asymmetric injection of the jet flow;
perhaps related to turbulence in the accretion disk; coupled with hydrodynamic
instabilities, leads to the non-ballistic dynamics that cause the observed
non-periodic changes in the direction of the inner jet.

a flexible grid of IA and galaxy bias parameters as used in previous work, and
investigate what would happen if the universe used the latest IA model, but we

gives regression-adjustment methods a useful interpretation and role in

obtains a rough estimate of the joint posterior via regression-adjustment ABC,
and then estimates each univariate marginal posterior distribution separately

providing an improved estimate of the joint posterior. We illustrate this
method with several examples. Supplementary materials for this article are

Contemporarily, PNC and SNC were proposed to propagate the MN context to the

which propagates the mobile node context to those AP's which do not overlap

These methods are then extended to the case of close approach to equilibrium

stringent tests with astrophysical thermonuclear networks, evidence is provided
that these methods can deal with the stiffest networks, even in the approach to
equilibrium, with accuracy and integration timestepping comparable to that of

scale more favorably with network size than implicit algorithms, our results
suggest that algebraically-stabilized explicit methods might enable integration

$U^2(2k_F)|\alpha|$, term scale linearly with $\tq$ for $\chi^{xx}$ and are
absent for $\chi^{zz}$. This anisotropy has important consequences for the
ferromagnetic nuclear-spin phase: $(i)$ the ordered state--if achieved--is of
an Ising type and $(ii)$ the spin-wave dispersion is gapped at $\tq=0$. To
second order in $U(q)$, the dispersion a decreasing function of $\tq$, and
anisotropy is not sufficient to stabilize long-range order. However,
renormalization in the Cooper channel for $\tq\ll2m^*|\alpha|$ is capable of
reversing the sign of the $\tq$-dependence of $\chi^{xx}$ and thus stabilizing
the ordered state. We also show that a combination of the electron-electron and
SO interactions leads to a new effect: long-wavelength Friedel oscillations in
the spin (but not charge) electron density induced by local magnetic moments.
The period of these oscillations is given by the SO length $\pi/m^*|\alpha|$.

imposes non-trivial conditions already on the level of Shannon entropies of the
given marginals. These entropic inequalities are necessary (but not sufficient)
criteria for the existence of a joint distribution. For every marginal problem,
a list of such Shannon-type entropic inequalities can be calculated by
Fourier-Motzkin elimination, and we offer a software interface to a
Fourier-Motzkin solver for doing so. For the case that the hypergraph of given
marginals is a cycle graph, we provide a complete analytic solution to the
problem of classifying all relevant entropic inequalities, and use this result
to bound the decay of correlations in stochastic processes. Furthermore, we
show that Shannon-type inequalities for differential entropies are not relevant
for continuous-variable marginal problems; non-Shannon-type inequalities are,
both in the discrete and in the continuous case. In contrast to other
approaches, our general framework easily adapts to situations where one has
additional (conditional) independence requirements on the joint distribution,
as in the case of graphical models. We end with a list of open problems.

the core, disk, and protostellar masses, radii, and mass accretion rates
predicted by the hydrodynamical simulations. From the resulting spectral energy
distributions, we calculate standard observational signatures (bolometric
luminosity, bolometric temperature, ratio of bolometric to submillimeter
luminosity) to directly compare to observations. We show that the accretion
process predicted by these models reproduces the full spread of observed
protostars in both Lbol - Tbol and Lbol - core mass space, including very low
luminosity objects, provides a reasonable match to the observed protostellar
luminosity distribution, and resolves the long-standing luminosity problem.
These models predict an embedded phase duration shorter than recent
observationally determined estimates (0.12 Myr vs. 0.44 Myr), and a fraction of
total time spent in Stage 0 of 23%, consistent with the range of values
determined by observations. On average, the models spend 1.3% of their total

with maximum values being 11.8% and 35.5% for the total time and accreted

skewed frequency profiles. Furthermore, the asymmetry is observed to have the
opposite sign in power spectra made from line-of-sight velocity and continuum
intensity. The asymmetry and its reversal in sign has previously been explained
using a combination of mechanisms that involve the acoustic source. A localized
acoustic source within an acoustic cavity naturally generates asymmetric
profiles through wave interference; however, the sign of the asymmetry due to
this mechanism is identical for all observables. The reversal of the asymmetry
between velocity and intensity observations has been attributed to the
visibility of the source itself (i.e., ""correlated noise""). In this paper, I
will show that asymmetry generated by a localized source can be interpreted as
either a wave interference effect in physical space, or a mode interference
effect in spectral space. I advocate a new mode-fitting procedure based on this
new interpretation, whereby the complex phases of all the modes determine the
mode asymmetries. Further, I suggest that information about the acoustic source
function is encapsulated in the amplitude of each mode, and present a scheme by
which the source function can be obtained from measured mode amplitudes by
standard helioseismic inversion techniques.

increases to a peak in ~1 year and then subsides over a period of 1-2 years
with the flux falling off exponentially as the blob moves outward and
dissipates. Similar peaks (bursts) are seen in the X-ray light curve and a
cross-correlation between the two shows a very high correlation with the X-ray
peaks leading the radio peaks by ~100 days. A second cross-correlation, this
time between the radio event start times and the X-ray light curve, also shows
a significant correlation. When this is taken together with the long (~1 yr)

Because X-ray telescopes do not have the resolution required to resolve the
accretion disc area from the pc-scale jet, this paper is the first to present

of this star in the next years will enable astronomers to obtain the best

J191643.83+393849.7 on the basis of fully evolutionary DA white-dwarf models.
Specifically, we employ a complete set of evolutionary DA white-dwarf
structures covering a wide range of effective temperatures, stellar masses, and
H envelope thicknesses. These models have been obtained on the basis of a
complete treatment of the evolutionary history of progenitors stars. We compute
g-mode adiabatic pulsation periods for this set of models and compare them with
the pulsation periods exhibited by WD J191643.83+393849.7. Based on a tentative
estimation of the mean period spacing of the star, we find that the stellar
mass should be substantially large ($\gtrsim 0.80 M_{\odot}$), in agreement
with the spectroscopically derived stellar mass. Also, from period-to-period
fits we find an asteroseismological model characterised by a low effective
temperature, rather high stellar mass and a thin H envelope. The possibility
that this rather massive pulsating white dwarf can be further monitored with
Kepler with a high degree of detail turns the star WD J191643.83+393849.7 into
a promising and unique object to study the physics of crystallization and

receiver architectures to multiGigabit/s speeds. Recent information-theoretic
results, obtained under ideal channel conditions (perfect synchronization, no
dispersion), indicate that low-precision ADC (1-4 bits) could be a suitable
choice for designing such high speed systems. In this work, we study the impact
of employing low-precision ADC in a {\it carrier asynchronous} system.
Specifically, we consider transmission over the block noncoherent Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, and investigate the achievable performance
under low-precision output quantization. We focus attention on an architecture
in which the receiver quantizes {\it only the phase} of the received signal:
this has the advantage of being implementable without automatic gain control,
using multiple 1-bit ADCs preceded by analog multipliers. For standard uniform
Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation, we study the structure of the transition
density of the resulting phase-quantized block noncoherent channel. Several
results, based on the symmetry inherent in the channel model, are provided to
characterize this transition density. Low-complexity procedures for computing
the channel capacity, and for block demodulation, are obtained using these
results. Numerical computations are performed to compare the performance of
quantized and unquantized systems, for different quantization precisions, and
different block lengths. It is observed, for example, that with QPSK
modulation, 8-bin phase quantization of the received signal recovers about
80-85% of the capacity attained with unquantized observations, while 12-bin
phase quantization recovers more than 90% of the unquantized capacity.
Dithering the constellation is shown to improve the performance in the face of
drastic quantization.

three-dimensional systems. These show universal statistical properties on long
length scales, and geometrical phase transitions analogous to percolation
transitions but in distinct universality classes. The field theories for these
problems have not previously been identified, so that while many numerical
studies have been performed, a framework for interpreting the results has been
lacking. We provide such a framework with mappings to simple supersymmetric
models. Our main focus is on vortices in short-range correlated complex fields,
which show a geometrical phase transition that we argue is described by the
CP^{k|k} model (essentially the CP^{n-1} model in the replica limit
n\rightarrow 1). This can be seen by mapping a lattice version of the problem
to a lattice gauge theory. A related field theory with a noncompact gauge
field, the 'NCCP^{k|k} model', is a supersymmetric extension of the standard
dual theory for the XY transition, and we show that XY duality gives another
way to understand the appearance of field theories of this type. The
supersymmetric descriptions yield results relevant, for example, to vortices in
the XY model and in superfluids, to optical vortices, and to certain models of
cosmic strings. A distinct but related field theory, the RP^{2l|2l} model (or
the RP^{n-1} model in the limit n\rightarrow 1) describes the unoriented
vortices which occur for instance in nematic liquid crystals. Finally, we show
that in two dimensions, a lattice gauge theory analogous to that discussed in
three dimensions gives a simple way to see the known relation between
two-dimensional percolation and the CP^{k|k} sigma model with a \theta-term.

""double-diffusive convection in the diffusive regime"" in Earth and planetary
sciences, occurs in stellar and planetary interiors in regions which are stable
according to the Ledoux criterion but unstable according to the Schwarzschild
criterion. In this series of papers, we analyze the results of an extensive
suite of 3D numerical simulations of the process, and ultimately propose a new
1D prescription for heat and compositional transport in this regime which can
be used in stellar or planetary structure and evolution models.
  In a preliminary study of the phenomenon, Rosenblum et al. (2011) showed
that, after saturation of the primary instability, a system can evolve in one
of two possible ways: the induced turbulence either remains homogeneous, with
very weak transport properties, or transitions into a thermo-compositional
staircase where the transport rate is much larger (albeit still smaller than in
standard convection).
  In this paper, we show that this dichotomous behavior is a robust property of
semi-convection across a wide region of parameter space. We propose a simple
semi-analytical criterion to determine whether layer formation is expected or
not, and at what rate it proceeds, as a function of the background
stratification and of the diffusion parameters (viscosity, thermal diffusivity
and compositional diffusivity) only. The theoretical criterion matches the
outcome of our numerical simulations very adequately in the numerically
accessible ""planetary"" parameter regime, and can easily be extrapolated to the
stellar parameter regime.
  Subsequent papers will address more specifically the question of quantifying
transport in the layered case and in the non-layered case.

public goods game on the square lattice, the triangular lattice and the random
regular graph, whereby the payoffs are distributed either uniformly or
exponentially amongst the players by assigning to them individual scaling
factors that determine the share of the public good they will receive. We find
that uniformly distributed public goods are more successful in maintaining high
levels of cooperation than exponentially distributed public goods. This is not
in agreement with previous results on games governed by pairwise interactions,
indicating that group interactions may be less susceptible to the promotion of
cooperation by means of strong heterogeneity as originally assumed, and that
the role of strongly heterogeneous states should be reexamined for other types

the isolation of the Compton thick objects, and may represent a useful tool for
future hard X-ray observations of newly discovered AGN. We are unable to
associate the reflection components with the absorbing gas as a torus, a more
complex scenario being necessary. In the Compton thin sources, a fraction (but
not all) of the Fe K line needs to be produced in a gas possibly associated
with the optical Broad Line Region, responsible also for the absorption. We
still need a Compton thick medium (not intercepting the line of sight) likely
associated to a torus, which contributes to the Fe line intensity and produces
the observed reflection continuum above 10 keV. The so-called Iwasawa-Taniguchi

growth conditions very different from those of a typical laboratory xperiment.
In particular, removal rates of biomass and substrate are unlikely to be
balanced under realistic environmental conditions. Here, we consider a single
population growing on a substrate under conditions where the removal rates of
substrate and biomass are not necessarily equal. For a large population, with
deterministic growth dynamics, our model predicts that this system can show
transient (damped) oscillations. For a small population, demographic noise
causes these oscillations to be sustained indefinitely. These oscillations
arise when the dynamics of changes in biomass are faster than the dynamics of
the substrate, for example, due to a high microbial death rate and/or low
substrate flow rates. We show that the same mechanism can produce sustained
stochastic oscillations in a two-species, nutrient-cycling microbial ecosystem.
Our results suggest that oscillatory population dynamics may be a common
feature of small microbial populations in the natural environment, even in the
absence of complex interspecies interactions.

the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way and other disk galaxies. Thermal
conduction plays an important role in the TI by stabilizing small scales and
limiting the size of the smallest condensates. In the magnetized ISM, however,
heat is conducted anisotropically (primarily along magnetic field lines). We
investigate the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the nonlinear
regime of the TI by performing two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations.
We present models with magnetic fields of different initial geometries and
strengths, and compare them to hydrodynamic models with isotropic conduction.
We find anisotropic conduction does not significantly alter the overall density
and temperature statistics in the saturated state of the TI. However, it can
strongly affect the shapes and sizes of cold clouds formed by the TI. For
example, for uniform initial fields long filaments of cold gas are produced
that are reminiscent of some observed HI clouds. For initially tangled fields,
such filaments are not produced. We also show that anisotropic conduction
suppresses turbulence generated by evaporative flows from the surfaces of cold
blobs, which may have implications for mechanisms for driving turbulence in the

populations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples that
are carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible the
well-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population of
galaxies. Once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, we
find that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parent

and external pressure that decreases as a power of spherical radius, p \propto
r^(-eta), the jet interior will lose causal contact when eta > 2. However, the
outer layers of the jet gradually collimate toward the jet axis as long as eta
< 4, leading to the formation of a shocked boundary layer. Assuming that
pressure-matching across the shock front determines the shape of the shock, we
study the resulting structure of the jet in two ways: first by assuming that
the pressure remains constant across the shocked boundary layer and looking for
solutions to the shock jump equations, and then by constructing self-similar
boundary-layer solutions that allow for a pressure gradient across the shocked
layer. We demonstrate that the constant-pressure solutions can be characterized
by four initial parameters that determine the jet shape and whether the shock
closes to the axis. We show that self-similar solutions for the boundary layer
can be constructed that exhibit a monotonic decrease in pressure across the
boundary layer from the contact discontinuity to the shock front, and that the
addition of this pressure gradient in our initial model generally causes the
shock front to move outwards, creating a thinner boundary layer and decreasing
the tendency of the shock to close. We discuss trends based on the value of the

the thermal case, the Euclidean continuation of the supersymmetric AdS black
hole does not smoothly fill in these boundary conditions, leading us to ask the
title question. In the context of AdS3/CFT2, we show using supersymmetric
localization that the gravitational functional integral for the elliptic genus
localizes onto asymptotically AdS3 configurations that are annihilated by a

conformal block decomposition in the flat space limit. When applied to
perturbation theory in AdS, this gives a holographic derivation of the cutting
rules for Feynman diagrams.
  To demonstrate these facts we introduce some new techniques for the analysis
of conformal field theories. Chief among these is a method for conglomerating
local primary operators to extract the contribution of an individual primary in
their OPE. This provides a method for isolating the contribution of specific
conformal blocks which we use to prove an important relation between certain
conformal block coefficients and anomalous dimensions. These techniques make

In this paper we combine integral field spectroscopy, CO observations and X-ray
data to study three exceptional clusters (Abell 1991, Abell 3444 and Ophiuchus)
where there is a physical and dynamical offset between the BCG and the cooling
peak to investigate the connection between the cooling of the intracluster

the soft X-rays. In the case of A1991 we make separate detections of CO(2-1)
emission on the BCG and on the peak of the soft X-ray emission suggesting that
cooling continues to occur in the core despite being offset from the BCG. We
conclude that there is a causal link between the lowest temperature (< 2 keV)
ICM gas and the molecular gas(~ 30K). This link is only apparent in systems
where a transitory event has decoupled the BCG from the soft X-ray peak. We
discuss the prospects for identifying more examples of this rare configuration.

calibration process utilizes SDSS r~16 mag point source objects as photometric
standards. During photometric conditions, this allows us to solve for the
extinction coefficients and color terms, and to estimate the camera
illumination correction. This also enables the calibration of fields that are
outside the SDSS footprint. We test the precision and repeatability of the PTF
photometric calibration. Given that PTF is observing in a single filter each
night, we define a PTF calibrated magnitude system for R-band and g-band. We
show that, in this system, 59% (47%) of the photometrically calibrated PTF
R-band (g-band) data achieve a photometric precision of 0.02-0.04 mag. Given
the objects' color, the PTF magnitude system can be converted to other systems.
A night-by-night comparison of the calibrated magnitudes of individual stars
observed on multiple nights shows that they are consistent to a level of ~0.02
mag. Most of the data that were taken under non-photometric conditions can be
calibrated relative to other epochs of the same sky footprint obtained during
photometric conditions. We provide a guide describing the use of the PTF

the vicinity of its zero temperature critical point is considered. The model is
known to be renormalisable in the large $N$ limit, which offers the possibility
to obtain expressions for various thermodynamic functions in closed form. We
have used the concept of finite--size scaling to extract information about the
leading temperature behavior of the free energy and the mass term, defined by
the fermionic condensate and determined the crossover lines in the coupling
($\g$) -- temperature ($T$) plane. These are given by $T\sim|\g-\g_c|$, where
$\g_c$ denotes the critical coupling at zero temperature. According to our
analysis no spontaneous symmetry breaking survives at finite temperature. We
have found that the leading temperature behavior of the fermionic condensate is
proportional to the temperature with the critical amplitude
$\frac{\sqrt{5}}3\pi$. The scaling function of the singular part of the free
energy is found to exhibit a maximum at $\frac{\ln2}{2\pi}$ corresponding to
one of the crossover lines. The critical amplitude of the singular part of the

$\frac13[\frac1{2\pi}\zeta(3)-\mathrm{Cl}_2(\frac{\pi}3)]=-0.274543...$, where

frequency distributions and parameter correlations of avalanches in nonlinear
dissipative systems in the state of a slowly-driven self-organized criticality
(SOC) system. This model, called the fractal-diffusive SOC model, is based on
the following four assumptions: (i) The avalanche size $L$ grows as a diffusive
random walk with time $T$, following $L \propto T^{1/2}$; (ii) The
instantaneous energy dissipation rate $f(t)$ occupies a fractal volume with
dimension $D_S$, which predicts the relationships $F = f(t=T) \propto L^{D_S}
\propto T^{D_S/2}$, $P \propto L^{S} \propto T^{S/2}$ for the peak energy
dissipation rate, and $E \propto F T \propto T^{1+D_S/2}$ for the total
dissipated energy; (iii) The mean fractal dimension of avalanches in Euclidean
space $S=1,2,3$ is $D_S \approx (1+S)/2$; and (iv) The occurrence frequency
distributions $N(x) \propto x^{-\alpha_x}$ based on spatially uniform
probabilities in a SOC system are given by $N(L) \propto L^{-S}$, which
predicts powerlaw distributions for all parameters, with the slopes
$\alpha_T=(1+S)/2$, $\alpha_F=1+(S-1)/D_S$, $\alpha_P=2-1/S$, and
$\alpha_E=1+(S-1)/(D_S+2)$. We test the predicted fractal dimensions,
occurrence frequency distributions, and correlations with numerical simulations
of cellular automaton models in three dimensions $S=1,2,3$ and find
satisfactory agreement within $\approx 10%$. One profound prediction of this
universal SOC model is that the energy distribution has a powerlaw slope in the
range of $\alpha_E=1.40-1.67$, and the peak energy distribution has a slope of
$\alpha_P=1.67$ (for any fractal dimension $D_S=1,...,3$ in Euclidean space
S=3), and thus predicts that the bulk energy is always contained in the largest
events, which rules out significant nanoflare heating in the case of solar

(2) we have implemented a new lattice renormalization scheme (the

chiral-symmetry breaking and other infrared effects and, in practice, also
shrinks the size of the 1-loop perturbative coefficient needed to match to the

That is, we assume a

fixed underlying subspace. We first estimate ""robust inverse sample covariance""
by solving a convex minimization procedure; we then recover the subspace by the
bottom eigenvectors of this matrix (their number correspond to the number of
eigenvalues close to 0). We guarantee exact subspace recovery under some
conditions on the underlying data. Furthermore, we propose a fast iterative
algorithm, which linearly converges to the matrix minimizing the convex
problem. We also quantify the effect of noise and regularization and discuss
many other practical and theoretical issues for improving the subspace recovery
in various settings. When replacing the sum of terms in the convex energy
function (that we minimize) with the sum of squares of terms, we obtain that
the new minimizer is a scaled version of the inverse sample covariance (when
exists). We thus interpret our minimizer and its subspace (spanned by its
bottom eigenvectors) as robust versions of the empirical inverse covariance and
the PCA subspace respectively. We compare our method with many other algorithms

transition from an orientational ordered phase at low temperature to the
disordered state at high temperature in a molecular crystal. Our model is a
Potts model which takes into account the exchange interaction $J$ between
nearest-neighbor molecules and a dipolar interaction between molecular axes in
three dimensions. The dipolar interaction is characterized by two parameters:
its amplitude $D$ and the cutoff distance $r_c$. If the molecular axis at a
lattice site has three orientations, say the $x$, $y$ or $z$ axes, then when
D=0, the system is equivalent to the 3-state Potts model: the transition to the
disordered phase is known to be of first order. When $D\neq 0$, the
ground-state configuration is shown to be composed of two independent
interpenetrating layered subsystems which form a sandwich whose periodicity
depends on $D$ and $r_c$. We show by extensive Monte Carlo simulation with a
histogram method that the phase transition remains of first order at relatively
large values of $r_c$.

debated. An important question that permeates this debate is the transport of
magnetic flux. This is particularly important, for instance, in the context of
star formation. When clouds collapse gravitationally to form stars, there must
be some magnetic flux transport. otherwise the new born stars would have
magnetic fields several orders of magnitude larger than the observed ones.
Also, the magnetic flux that is dragged in the late stages of the formation of
a star can remove all the rotational support from the accretion disk that grows
around the protostar. The efficiency of the mechanism which is often invoked to
allow the transport of magnetic fields in the different stages of star
formation, namely, the ambipolar diffusion, has been lately put in check. We
here discuss an alternative mechanism for magnetic flux transport which is
based on turbulent fast magnetic reconnection. We review recent results
obtained from 3D MHD numerical simulations that indicate that this mechanism is
very efficient for decoupling and transport magnetic flux from the inner denser
regions to the outskirts of collapsing clouds in the different stages of star
formation. We also discuss this mechanism in the context of dynamo processes
and speculate that it can play a role both in the solar dynamo and in accretion
disk dynamo processes.

multiple interfering links. In several such scenarios, interference alignment
was used to characterize the degrees-of-freedom of the channel. However, these
degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak to make accurate
predictions about the behavior of channel capacity at finite signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). The aim of this paper is to significantly strengthen these
results by showing that interference alignment can be used to characterize
capacity to within a constant gap. We focus on real, time-invariant,
frequency-flat X-channels. The only known solutions achieving the
degrees-of-freedom of this channel are either based on real interference
alignment or on layer-selection schemes. Neither of these solutions seems
sufficient for a constant-gap capacity approximation.
  In this paper, we propose a new communication scheme and show that it
achieves the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To
aid in this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel model. This
deterministic model depends on the 0.5log(SNR) most-significant bits of the
channel coefficients rather than only the single most-significant bit used in
conventional deterministic models. The proposed deterministic model admits a
wider range of achievable schemes that can be translated to the Gaussian
channel. For this deterministic model, we find an approximately optimal
communication scheme. We then translate this scheme for the deterministic
channel to the original Gaussian X-channel and show that it achieves capacity
to within a constant gap. This is the first constant-gap result for a general,
fully-connected network requiring interference alignment.

differential structure, shows the connection of 4-exotics with the
codimension-1 foliations of $S^{3}$, SU(2) WZW models and twisted K-theory
$K_{H}(S^{3})$, $H\in H^{3}(S^{3},\mathbb{Z})$. These results made it possible
to explicate some physical effects of exotic 4-smoothness. Here we present a
relation between exotic smooth R^4 and operator algebras. The correspondence
uses the leaf space of the codimension-1 foliation of S^3 inducing a von
Neumann algebra $W(S^{3})$ as description. This algebra is a type III_1 factor
lying at the heart of any observable algebra of QFT. By using the relation to
factor II, we showed that the algebra $W(S^{3})$ can be interpreted as
Drinfeld-Turaev deformation quantization of the space of flat SL(2,\mathbb{C})
connections (or holonomies). Thus, we obtain a natural relation to quantum
field theory. Finally we discuss the appearance of concrete action functionals
for fermions or gauge fields and its connection to quantum-field-theoretical
models like the Tree QFT of Rivasseau.

recombination under the action of restriction enzymes and ligases, and was
first introduced by Tom Head in 1987. Shortly thereafter, it was proven that
the languages generated by (finite) splicing systems form a proper subclass of
the class of regular languages. However, the question of whether or not one can
decide if a given regular language is generated by a splicing system remained
open. In this paper we give a positive answer to this question. Namely, we
prove that, if a language is generated by a splicing system, then it is also
generated by a splicing system whose size is a function of the size of the
syntactic monoid of the input language, and which can be effectively
constructed.

norms are shown to be preserved along time evolution and enhance the decay
rates. As a corollary, we also obtain the usual $L^p$--$L^2$($1<p\le 2$) type
of the optimal decay rates. Compared to the compressible Navier-Stokes system
and the compressible irrotational Euler-Poisson system, our results imply that
both the dispersion effect of the electric field and the viscous dissipation

observational data, we put bounds on the two parameters of the theory: the
Brans-Dicke coupling parameter \omega_{BD} and the scalar mass m_s. We find
that the most stringent bounds come from Cassini measurements of the Shapiro
time delay in the Solar System, that yield a lower bound \omega_{BD}>40000 for
scalar masses m_s<2.5x10^{-20} eV, to 95% confidence. In comparison,

population biology, evolution, and epidemiology. Even though extinction as a
random process is a rare event, its occurrence is observed in large finite
populations. Extinction occurs when fluctuations due to random transitions act
as an effective force which drives one or more components or species to vanish.
Although there are many random paths to an extinct state, there is an optimal
path that maximizes the probability to extinction. In this article, we show
that the optimal path is associated with the dynamical systems idea of having
maximum sensitive dependence to initial conditions. Using the equivalence
between the sensitive dependence and the path to extinction, we show that the
dynamical systems picture of extinction evolves naturally toward the optimal
path in several stochastic models of epidemics.

time series for the operational state of thermal power plants that would
maximize the profits of an electric power utility by taking into account both
the forecast of output its error for renewable energies and the demand response
of consumers. We consider a power system consisting of thermal power plants,
photovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze the effect of the
forecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the
operation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden
decrease in wind power is also analyzed. More thermal power plants need to be
operated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The
increase in the number of operating thermal power plants within a short period
does not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the
substitution of thermal power plants by wind farms or PV systems is not
expected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the
case of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed. We confirm that the
number of operating thermal power plants is reduced by the demand response. A
power utility has to continue thermal power plants for ensuring supply-demand
balance; some of these plants can be decommissioned after installing a large
number of wind farms or PV systems, if the demand response is applied using an
appropriate price structure.

elementary form when two flat surfaces separated by vacuum gap are sliding
relative to each other at zero Kelvin and the friction is generated by the
relative movement of quantum fluctuations. For several decades physicists have
been intrigued by the idea of quantum friction. It has recently been shown that
two non-contacting bodies moving relative to each other experience a friction
due to quantum fluctuations inside the bodies \cite{VolokitinRMP2007}. However
until recent time there was no experimental evidence for or against this
effect, because the predicted friction forces are very small, and precise
measurements of quantum forces are incredibly difficult with present
technology. The existence of quantum friction is still debated even among
theoreticians \cite{Philbin2009,Pendry2010,VolokitinNJP2011}. However,
situation drastically changed with the creation of new material - graphene. We
recently proposed \cite{VolokitinPRL2011} that quantum friction can be observed
in experiments studying electrical transport phenomena in nonsuspended graphene
on amorphous SiO$_2$ substrate.

global population. One unfortunate phenomenon, however, poisons the competition
and the fun: cheating. The costs of cheating span from industry-supported
expenditures to detect and limit cheating, to victims' monetary losses due to
cyber crime.
  This paper studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an online social network
built on top of the world's dominant digital game delivery platform. We
collected information about more than 12 million gamers connected in a global
social network, of which more than 700 thousand have their profiles flagged as
cheaters. We also collected in-game interaction data of over 10 thousand
players from a popular multiplayer gaming server. We show that cheaters are
well embedded in the social and interaction networks: their network position is
largely undistinguishable from that of fair players. We observe that the
cheating behavior appears to spread through a social mechanism: the presence
and the number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with the
likelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. Also, we observe that there
is a social penalty involved with being labeled as a cheater: cheaters are
likely to switch to more restrictive privacy settings once they are tagged and
they lose more friends than fair players. Finally, we observe that the number
of cheaters is not correlated with the geographical, real-world population
density, or with the local popularity of the Steam Community.
  This analysis can ultimately inform the design of mechanisms to deal with
anti-social behavior (e.g., spamming, automated collection of data) in generic
online social networks.

sequence of DQ white dwarfs, both carbon and nitrogen would be dredged up from
the core. The C/N abundance ratio (~ 50) in the atmosphere of this unique DQ
white dwarf suggests the presence of unprocessed material (14N) in the core or
in the envelope. Helium burning in the DQ progenitor may have terminated early
on the red-giant branch after a mass-ejection event leaving unprocessed
material in the core although current mass estimates do not favor the presence
of a low-mass helium core. Alternatively, some nitrogen in the envelope may
have survived an abridged helium-core burning phase prior to climbing the

limit to photon mass by investigating the primordial magnetic fields. Earlier
Bertolami et al [Phys Lett \textbf{B} 455, 96(1999)] showed that massive
photons in a spontaneous Lorentz breaking may generate primordial magnetic
fields consistent with galactic dynamo seeds. Torsion coupling constant of
order $10^{-5}$, much higher than the previously obtained by de Sabbata and
Sivaram of $10^{-24}$, leads to strong amplification of magnetic field able to
seed galactic dynamo at recombination era contrary to what happens in general
relativistic dynamos. This results in $B\sim{10^{-5}{\beta}G}$ where ${\beta}$
is the massive photon-torsion coupling. Thus in order to obtain the observed
galaxy field of $B_{G}\sim{{\mu}G}$ one should have a coupling
$\beta\sim{10^{-1}}$, never observed in the universe. Thus we may conclude that
the weaker couplings for torsion to e.m fields shall only produce magnetic
fields without dynamos starting from extremely strong magnetic seeds. From the
strongest photon-torsion considered one obtains the best CMB estimate for
torsion generated magnetic fields $\frac{{\delta}B}{B}\le{10^{-4}}$. By making
use of the strong photon-torsion limits obtained here, photon mass limit of
$m_{\gamma}\sim{10^{-24}eV}$, well-within limits found in literature, which
allows us to conclude that a stronger massive photon-torsion limit is
physically consistent. Actually this last limit is also graviton mass limit.

unidentified Fermi-LAT \gamma-ray sources at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>10

Observatory. In this second year of the project, seven new targets were
selected from the First Fermi-LAT Catalog, and studied with 20-40 ks effective
Suzaku exposures. We detected an X-ray point source coincident with the
position of the recently discovered millisecond pulsar PSR J2302+4442 within
the 95% confidence error circle of 1FGL J2302.8+4443. The X-ray spectrum of the
detected counterpart was well fit by a blackbody model with temperature of kT
~0.3 keV, consistent with an origin of the observed X-ray photons from the
surface of a rotating magnetized neutron star. For four other targets which
were also recently identified with a normal pulsar (1FGL J0106.7+4853) and
millisecond pulsars (1FGL J1312.6+0048, J1902.0-5110, and J2043.2+1709), only
upper limits in the 0.5-10 keV band were obtained at the flux levels of

1FGL J1739.4+8717, but its association with the variable \gamma-ray emitter
could not be confirmed with the available Suzaku data alone. For the remaining
Fermi-LAT object 1FGL J1743.8-7620 no X-ray source was detected within the LAT
95% error ellipse. We briefly discuss the general properties of the observed
high Galactic-latitude Fermi-LAT objects by comparing their multiwavelength

least-squares curve fitting. The compensation($\Delta_{t}$) is only a small

Forty years ago, Cover introduced and compared two schemes: time sharing and

some channels, modern satellite communications systems such as DVB-SH and
DVB-S2 mainly rely on time sharing strategy to optimize the throughput. They
consider hierarchical modulation, a practical implementation of superposition
coding, but only for unequal error protection or backward compatibility
purposes. We propose in this article to combine time sharing and hierarchical
modulation together and show how this scheme can improve the performance in
terms of available rate. We introduce the hierarchical 16-APSK to boost the
performance of the DVB-S2 standard. We also evaluate various strategies to
group the receivers in pairs when using hierarchical modulation. Finally, we
show in a realistic use case based on DVB-S2 that the combined scheme can
provide throughput gains greater than 10% compared to the best time sharing
strategy.

adjacency matrix. Woo and Neumaier discovered that a connected graph $G$ with
$\rho(G)\leq 3/2{\sqrt{2}}$ is either a dagger, an open quipu, or a closed
quipu. The reverse statement is not true. Many open quipus and closed quipus
have spectral radius greater than $3/2{\sqrt{2}}$. In this paper we proved the
following results. For any open quipu $G$ on $n$ vertices ($n\geq 6$) with
spectral radius less than $3/2{\sqrt{2}}$, its diameter $D(G)$ satisfies
$D(G)\geq (2n-4)/3$. This bound is tight. For any closed quipu $G$ on $n$
vertices ($n\geq 13$) with spectral radius less than $3/2{\sqrt{2}}$, its
diameter $D(G)$ satisfies $\frac{n}{3}< D(G)\leq \frac{2n-2}{3}$. The upper
bound is tight while the lower bound is asymptotically tight.
  Let $G^{min}_{n,D}$ be a graph with minimal spectral radius among all
connected graphs on $n$ vertices with diameter $D$. We applied the results and
found $G^{min}_{n,D}$ for some range of $D$. For $n\geq 13$ and $D\in
[\frac{n}{2}, \frac{2n-7}{3}]$, we proved that $G^{min}_{n,D}$ is the graph
obtained by attaching two paths of length $D-\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ and
$D-\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ to a pair of antipodal vertices of the even cycle
$C_{2(n-D)}$. Thus we settled a conjecture of Cioab-van Dam-Koolen-Lee, who

concentrations of product by means of RP-HPLC. Kinetic modeling with the SimFit
program revealed parabolic growth according to the so-called square-root law.
The observed template effect, as well as the rate of the ligation, was
significantly influenced by factors like nucleophilic catalysts, pH value, and
uncharged co-solvents. Systematic optimization of the reaction conditions
allowed us to increase the autocatalytic efficiency of the system by two orders
of magnitude.

losses. Mesh-based protection schemes offer high capacity efficiency but they
are slow and require complex signaling. Additionally, real-time reconfiguration
of a cross-connect threatens their transmission integrity. On the other hand,
coding-based protection schemes are proactive. Therefore, they have higher
restoration speed, lower signaling complexity, and higher transmission
integrity. This paper introduces a coding-based protection scheme, named Coded
Path Protection (CPP). In CPP, a backup copy of the primary data is encoded
with other data streams, resulting in capacity savings. This paper presents an
optimal and simple capacity placement and coding group formation algorithm. The
algorithm converts the sharing structure of any solution of a Shared Path
Protection (SPP) technique into a coding structure with minimum extra capacity.
We conducted quantitative and qualitative comparisons of our technique with the
SPP and, another technique, known as p-cycle protection. Simulation results
confirm that the CPP is significantly faster than the SPP and p-cycle
techniques. CPP incurs marginal extra capacity on top of SPP. Its capacity
efficiency is lower than the p-cycle technique for dense networks but can be
higher for sparse networks. In addition, unlike p-cycle protection, CPP is
inherently suitable for the wavelength continuity constraint in optical
networks.

exhibited by the wavefunctions corresponding to the ground, first and second

entanglement of the system tends to increase with energy, and in the case of
excited states we found a finite amount of entanglement in the limit of

ground and first few excited states of the two-electron Moshinsky model in the
presence of a magnetic field. The dependence of the eigenstates' entanglement
on the energy, as well as its behaviour in the regime of vanishing interaction,
are similar to those observed in the three-electron system. On the other hand,
the entanglement exhibits a monotonically decreasing behavior with the strength
of the external magnetic field. For strong magnetic fields the entanglement
approaches a finite asymptotic value that depends on the interaction strength.
For both systems studied here we consider a perturbative approach in order to
shed some light on the entanglement's dependence on energy and also to clarify
the finite entanglement exhibited by excited states in the limit of weak
interactions. As far as we know, this is the first work that provides
analytical and exact results for the entanglement properties of a

classical modular substitution given by $q^*=e^{-2\pi i/\tau}$ and $\iota_q
x=e^{2\pi i\xi/{\tau}}$. The main goal of this Note is to study the ""modular
behaviour"" of the infinite product $(x;q)_\infty$, this means, to compare the
function defined by $(x;q)_\infty$ with that given by $(\iota_q x;q^*)_\infty$.
Inspired by the work of Stieltjes on some semi-convergent series, we are led to
a ""closed"" analytic formula for $(x;q)_\infty$ by means of the dilogarithm
combined with a Laplace type integral that admits a divergent series as Taylor
expansion at $\log q=0$. Thus, we can obtain an expression linking
$(x;q)_\infty$ to its modular transform $(\iota_qx;q^*)_\infty$ and which
contains, in essence, the modular formulae known for Dedekind's eta function,
Jacobi theta function and also for certain Lambert series. Among other
applications, one can remark that our results allow to obtain a Ramanujan's
asymptotic formula about $(x;q)_\infty$ for $q\to 1$.

expensive for large programs; most tools relax one or both of the requirements
for scalability. We formulate a flow- and context-sensitive points-to analysis
that is lazy in the following sense: points-to information is computed only for
live pointers and its propagation is sparse (restricted to live ranges of
respective pointers). Further, our analysis (a) uses strong liveness,
effectively including dead code elimination; (b) afterwards calculates
must-points-to information from may-points-to information instead of using a
mutual fixed-point; and (c) uses value-based termination of call strings during
interprocedural analysis (which reduces the number of call strings
significantly).
  A naive implementation of our analysis within GCC-4.6.0 gave analysis time
and size of points-to measurements for SPEC2006. Using liveness reduced the
amount of points-to information by an order of magnitude with no loss of
precision. For all programs under 30kLoC we found that the results were much
more precise than gcc's analysis. What comes as a pleasant surprise however, is
the fact that below this cross-over point, our naive linked-list implementation
is faster than a flow- and context-insensitive analysis which is primarily used
for efficiency. We speculate that lazy flow- and context-sensitive analyses may

vortices with different pinning strength.

""asymmetric tacnode process"". It is a determinantal point process with
correlation kernel given by two parameters: (1) the curvature's ratio \lambda>0

  Kashiwara proved that any complex contact manifold $X$ is quantized by a
canonical microdifferential algebroid (a linear stack locally equivalent to an
algebra of microdifferential operators). Besides the canonical one, there can
be other microdifferential algebroids on $X$. Our aim is to classify them. More
precisely, let $Y$ be the symplectification of $X$. We prove that Morita (resp.
equivalence) classes of microdifferential algebroids on $X$ are described by
$H^2(Y;{\mathbb C}^\times)$. We also show that any linear stack locally
equivalent to a stack of microdifferential modules is in fact a stack of
modules over a microdifferential algebroid.
  To obtain these results we use techniques of microlocal calculus, non-abelian
cohomology and Morita theory for linear stacks.

several kinds of data such as genetic or phenotypic markers or spatial

original advantage: (i) it incorporates information about the spatial

relate more explicitly observed patterns to geography; and (ii) it allows one
to analyze genetic and phenotypic data within a unified model and inference
framework, thus opening the way to robust comparisons between markers and
possibly combined analyzes. We show from simulated data as well are real data
from the literature that our method estimates parameters accurately and
improves alternative approaches in many situations. The interest of this method
is exemplified using an intricate case of inter- and intra-species
differentiation based on an original data-set of georeferenced genetic and
morphometric markers obtained on {\em Myodes} voles from Sweden. A computer

extreme Coulomb splitting of corresponding symmetric and anti-symmetric dimer

laminations with a transverse invariant measure. Here, we use the transverse
measure of the contraction of a tangential categorical open set instead of
counting this set. This new measured category is invariant by leafwise homotopy
equivalences preserving the transverse measures, and the condition of being
zero or positive is a transverse invariant. The usual tangential LS category is
also bounded by the number of certain critical sets. It is also proved that the
measured category is semicontinuous when the foliated structure and the
transverse invariant measure varies on a fixed manifold, which is a version of
a result of W. Singhof and E. Vogt for the tangential category. Hopefully, this
relation between LS category and critical sets will be useful to deal with
foliated versions of variational problems, like the existence of closed

(RMC) refinement is applied to the study of apical Cu-O bond distortions in the

consistent with a split-site model for the corresponding Cu and O positions,
but that the local structure nevertheless reveals the existence of two separate
apical Cu-O bond lengths. Using G(r) data obtained from a variety of Qmax
values we show that this result is independent of the data treatment
methodology. We also find that the resulting 'short' and 'long' Cu-O bond
lengths agree well with the results of previous EXAFS studies. The existence of
bimodal apical Cu-O bond distributions in the context of a single-site average
structure model is interpreted in terms of correlated displacements of the Cu
and O atoms. We find evidence also for the clustering of short apical Cu-O
bonds within our RMC configurations.

the droplet ensemble during the entrainment of subsaturated air, in particular
the dependence on turbulence time scales, droplet number density, initial
droplet radius and particle inertia. We find that the droplet evolution during
the entrainment process is captured best by a phase relaxation time that is
based on the droplet number density with respect to the entire simulation
domain and the initial droplet radius. Even under conditions favoring
homogeneous mixing, the probability density function of supersaturation at
droplet locations exhibits initially strong negative skewness, consistent with
droplets near the cloud boundary being suddenly mixed into clear air, but
rapidly approaches a narrower, symmetric shape. The droplet size distribution,
which is initialized as perfectly monodisperse, broadens and also becomes
somewhat negatively skewed. Particle inertia and gravitational settling lead to
a more rapid initial evaporation, but ultimately only to slight depletion of
both tails of the droplet size distribution. The Reynolds number dependence of
the mixing process remained weak over the parameter range studied, most
probably due to the fact that the inhomogeneous mixing regime could not be
fully accessed when phase relaxation times based on global number density are
considered.

we analyse the contact process, i.e. the simplest model for propagation

effects, leading rather generically to anomalously slow (algebraic,

similar effects to exist for other topologies as long as a non-vanishing
percolation threshold exists. More strikingly, we find that Griffiths phases
can also emerge --even with constant epidemic rates-- as a consequence of mere
topological heterogeneity. In particular, we find Griffiths phases in finite
dimensional networks as, for instance, a family of generalized small-world
networks. These results have a broad spectrum of implications for propagation
phenomena and other dynamical processes on networks, and are relevant for the
analysis of both models and empirical data.

competitive ratio which is the worst-case ratio of the cost of a given control
design strategy to the cost of the optimal control design with full model
information. It was recently shown that when it comes to designing optimal
centralized or partially structured decentralized state-feedback controllers
with limited model information, the best control design strategy in terms of
competitive ratio is a static one. This is true even though the optimal
structured decentralized state-feedback controller with full model information
is dynamic. In this paper, we show that, in contrast, the best limited model
information control design strategy for the disturbance accommodation problem
gives a dynamic controller. We find an explicit minimizer of the competitive
ratio and we show that it is undominated, that is, there is no other control
design strategy that performs better for all possible plants while having the
same worst-case ratio. This optimal controller can be separated into a static
feedback law and a dynamic disturbance observer. For constant disturbances, it
is shown that this structure corresponds to proportional-integral control.

is introduced by our limited knowledge of the statistics of galaxy cluster
structure, and of the scaling relations between observables and cluster mass. A
large effort is therefore undertaken to compile global galaxy cluster
properties in particular obtained through X-ray observations and to study their
scaling relations. However, the scaling schemes used in the literature differ.
The present paper aims to clarify this situation by providing a thorough review
of the scaling laws within the standard model of large-scale structure growth
and to discus various steps of practical approximations. We derive the scaling
laws for X-ray observables and cluster mass within the pure gravitational
structure growth scenario. Using N-body simulations we test the recent
formation approximation used in earlier analytic approaches which involves a
redshift dependent overdensity parameter.We find this approximation less
precise than the use of a fiducial radius based on a fixed overdensity with
respect to critical density. Inspired by the comparison of the predicted
scaling relations with observations we propose a first order modification of
the scaling scheme to include the observed effects of hydrodynamics in
structure formation. This modification involves a cluster mass dependent gas
mass fraction. We also discuss the observational results of the reshift
evolution of the most important scaling relations and find that also a redshift
dependence of the gas mass to total mass relation has to be invoked within our
modification scheme. We find that the current observational data are within
their uncertainties consistent with the proposed modified scaling laws.

planet formation around stars more massive than the Sun. Masses of isolated
giant stars up to now were only estimated from evolutionary tracks, which led
to different results depending on the physics considered. To calibrate the
theory, it is therefore important to measure a large number of giant star
diameters and masses as much as possible independent of physical models. We aim
in the determination of diameters and effective temperatures of 5 giant stars,
one of which is known to host a planet. AMBER/VLTI observations with the ATs

accurate calibrated squared visibilities, a calibrator-star-calibrator

limb-darkened angular diameters of 4 giant stars. The effective temperatures
were also derived by combining the bolometric luminosities and the
interferometric diameters. Lower effective temperatures were found when
compared to spectroscopic measurements. The giant star HD12438 was found to

fragmentation can already take place during the prestellar phase. The origin of
this substructure is likely caused by thermal Jeans fragmentation of the

process (r-process) since shapes evolve with the emergence of shells and
sub-shells. There was some indication in neighboring nuclei that we might find
examples of a new N=56 sub-shell, which may give rise to a doubly magic Se-90
nucleus. Beta-decay half lives of nuclei around Se-90 have been measured to
determine if this nucleus has in fact a doubly-magic character. The
fragmentation of Xe-136 beam at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory at Michigan State University was used to create a cocktail of nuclei
in the A=90 region. We have measured the half lives of twenty-two nuclei near
the r-process path in the A=90 region. The half lives of As-88 and Se-90 have
been measured for the first time. The values were compared with theoretical
predictions in the search for nuclear-deformation signatures of a N=56
sub-shell, and its possible role in the emergence of a potential doubly-magic
Se-90. The impact of such hypothesis on the synthesis of heavy nuclei,
particularly in the production of Sr, Y and Zr elements was investigated with a
weak r-process network. The new half lives agree with results obtained from a
standard global QRPA model used in r-process calculations, indicating that
Se-90 has a quadrupole shape incompatible with a closed N=56 sub-shell in this
region. The impact of the measured Se-90 half-life in comparison with a former
theoretical predication associated with a spherical half-life on the
weak-r-process is shown to be strong.

significantly smaller change in the work function (and to a correspondingly
smaller induced dipole moment) than Cu(111). The role of the chosen reference

gravitino LSP, behaving as a goldstino, and a number of neutral fermions (the
pseudo-goldstini) with a mass between that of the LSP and that of the lightest
particle of the observable sector (LOSP). We consider the two situations where
the LOSP is either a gaugino-like neutralino or a stau and we assume only one
pseudo-goldstino of a mass of O(100) GeV. The coupling of the LOSP to the
pseudo-goldstino can be enhanced with respect to those of the gravitino giving
rise to characteristic signatures. We show that the decay modes of the LOSP
