a three-body system with the interacting forces coming from a set of two-body
potentials that depend on both the distance between the quarks and the spin and
orbital angular momentum coupling terms. Constraint dynamics is first reviewed
for a relativistic two-body system in order to assemble the necessary two body
framework for the three-body problem and then we review the different types of
covariant two-body interactions involved in constraint dynamics, including
vector and scalar, and solve the problem of energy eigenstates using constraint
dynamics. The Two Body Dirac equations of constraint dynamics derived by Crater
and Van Alstine, matched with the quasipotential formalism of Todorov as the
underlying two-body formalism are used, as well as the three-body constraint
formalism of Sazdjian to integrate the three two-body equations into a single
relativistically covariant three body equation for the bound state energies.
The results are analyzed and compared to experiment using a best fit method and
several different algorithms, including a gradient approach, and Monte Carlo
method.

Benaim, Hofbauer and Sorin is extended for asynchronous stochastic
approximations with a set-valued mean field. The asynchronicity of the process
is incorporated into the mean field to produce convergence results which remain
similar to those of an equivalent synchronous process. In addition, this allows
many of the restrictive assumptions previously associated with asynchronous
stochastic approximation to be removed. The framework is extended for a coupled
asynchronous stochastic approximation process with set-valued mean fields.
Two-timescales arguments are used here in a similar manner to the original work
in this area by Borkar. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated
through learning in a Markov decision process.

often intractable. Expectation propagation (EP) can be used for approximate
inference. However, the regular sequential form of EP (R-EP) may fail to
converge in this model when the size of the training set is very small. As an
alternative, we propose a provably convergent EP algorithm (PC-EP). PC-EP is
proved to minimize an energy function which, under some constraints, is bounded
from below and whose stationary points coincide with the solution of R-EP.
Experiments with synthetic data indicate that when R-EP does not converge, the
approximation generated by PC-EP is often better. By contrast, when R-EP
converges, both methods perform similarly.

communication in the Internet. Their crucial role in TCP design and operation
has been studied extensively, in particular with respect to identifying
non-conformant, buggy, or underperforming behaviour. However, TCP segment
retransmissions are often overlooked when examining and analyzing large traffic
traces. In fact, some have come to believe that retransmissions are a rare
oddity, characteristically associated with faulty network paths, which,
typically, tend to disappear as networking technology advances and link
capacities grow. We find that this may be far from the reality experienced by
TCP flows. We quantify aggregate TCP segment retransmission rates using
publicly available network traces from six passive monitoring points attached
to the egress gateways at large sites. In virtually half of the traces examined
we observed aggregate TCP retransmission rates exceeding 1%, and of these,
about half again had retransmission rates exceeding 2%. Even for sites with low
utilization and high capacity gateway links, retransmission rates of 1%, and
sometimes higher, were not uncommon. Our results complement, extend and bring
up to date partial and incomplete results in previous work, and show that TCP
retransmissions continue to constitute a non-negligible percentage of the
overall traffic, despite significant advances across the board in
telecommunications technologies and network protocols. The results presented
are pertinent to end-to-end protocol designers and evaluators as they provide a
range of ""realistic"" scenarios under which, and a ""marker"" against which,
simulation studies can be configured and calibrated, and future protocols

individual channel alone is not significant, the exclusive combination across
multiple channels is shown to provide a sensitivity competitive with other

hypergraph so that each hyperedge, all of which have cardinality at most d,
contains at least one selected vertex. The applications of d-Hitting Set are,
for example, fault diagnosis, automatic program verification, and the
noise-minimizing assignment of frequencies to radio transmitters.
  We show a linear-time algorithm that transforms an instance of d-Hitting Set
into an equivalent instance comprising at most O(k^d) hyperedges and vertices.
In terms of parameterized complexity, this is a problem kernel. Our
kernelization algorithm is based on speeding up the well-known approach of
finding and shrinking sunflowers in hypergraphs, which yields problem kernels
with structural properties that we condense into the concept of expressive
kernelization.
  We conduct experiments to show that our kernelization algorithm can kernelize
instances with more than 10^7 hyperedges in less than five minutes.
  Finally, we show that the number of vertices in the problem kernel can be
further reduced to O(k^{d-1}) with additional O(k^{1.5 d}) processing time by
nontrivially combining the sunflower technique with d-Hitting Set problem
kernels due to Abu-Khzam and Moser.

algorithms can fail for unbalanced data for many popular graphs such as k-NN,
\epsilon-neighborhood and full-RBF graphs. We propose a novel graph
construction technique that encodes global statistical information into node
degrees through a ranking scheme. The rank of a data sample is an estimate of
its p-value and is proportional to the total number of data samples with
smaller density. This ranking scheme serves as a surrogate for density; can be
reliably estimated; and indicates whether a data sample is close to
valleys/modes. This rank-modulated degree(RMD) scheme is able to significantly
sparsify the graph near valleys and provides an adaptive way to cope with
unbalanced data. We then theoretically justify our method through limit cut
analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real

approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory, loop quantum gravity and
black-hole physics. In this scenario, all commutation relations are modified
and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is changed to the so-called
Generalized (Gravitational) Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Here, we present a
one-dimensional nonperturbative approach to quantum mechanics with minimal
length uncertainty relation which implies X=x to all orders and P=p+(1/3)\beta
p^3 to first order of GUP parameter \beta, where X and P are the generalized
position and momentum operators and [x,p]=i\hbar. We show that this formalism
is an equivalent representation of the seminal proposal by Kempf, Mangano, and
Mann and predicts the same physics. However, this proposal reveals many
significant aspects of the generalized uncertainty principle in a simple and
comprehensive form and the existence of a maximal canonical momentum is
manifest through this representation. The problems of the free particle and the
harmonic oscillator are exactly solved in this GUP framework and the effects of
GUP on the thermodynamics of these systems are also presented. Although X, P,
and the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator all are formally self-adjoint,
the careful study of the domains of these operators shows that only the
momentum operator remains self-adjoint in the presence of the minimal length
uncertainty. We finally discuss the difficulties with the definition of

sheet of the two-sheeted two-dimensional hyperboloid), to preserve the
$(2l+1)$-fold degeneracy of the states typical for the geodesic motion there,
is usually explained in casting the respective Hamiltonian in terms of the
Casimir invariant of an so(2,1) algebra, referred to as potential algebra. In
general, there are many possible similarity transformations of the symmetry
algebras of the free motions on curved surfaces towards potential algebras,
which are not all necessarily unitary. In the literature, a transformation of
the symmetry algebra of the geodesic motion on ${\bf H}^2_+$ towards the
potential algebra of Eckart's Hamiltonian has been constructed for the prime
purpose to prove that the Eckart interaction belongs to the class of Natanzon
potentials. We here take a different path and search for a transformation which
connects the $(2l+1)$ dimensional representation space of the pseudo-rotational
so(2,1) algebra, spanned by the rank-$l$ pseudo-spherical harmonics, to the
representation space of equal dimension of the potential algebra and find a
transformation of the scaling type. Our case is that in so doing one is
producing a deformed isometry copy to ${\bf H}^2_+$ such that the free motion
on the copy is equivalent to a motion on ${\bf H}^2_+$, perturbed by a $\coth$
interaction. In this way, we link the so(2,1) potential algebra concept of the
Eckart Hamiltonian to a subtle type of pseudo-rotational symmetry breaking
through ${\bf H}^2_+$ metric deformation.

many domains such as service recommendation systems and investment planning.
Related works in this field are based on top-k queries. The problem with top-k

aggregating them. This is hard for him in most cases. In this paper a new type
of user preference queries called spatial nearest neighbor skyline queries will
be introduced in which user has some sets of points as query parameters. For
each point in database attributes are its distances to the nearest neighbors

on the mass of the atomic nucleus and is therefore different for isotopes
belonging to the same element. The possible presence of an isotope effect
followed from Bohr's atomic theory of 1913, but it took several years before it
was confirmed experimentally. Its early history involves the childhood not only
of the quantum atom, but also of the concept of isotopy. Bohr's prediction of
the isotope effect was apparently at odds with early attempts to distinguish
between isotopes by means of their optical spectra. However, in 1920 the effect
was discovered in HCl molecules, which gave rise to a fruitful development in
molecular spectroscopy. The first detection of an atomic isotope effect was no
less important, as it was by this means that the heavy hydrogen isotope
deuterium was discovered in 1932. The early development of isotope spectroscopy
illustrates the complex relationship between theory and experiment, and is also
instructive with regard to the concepts of prediction and discovery.

by about 15-40% depending on the collision and model configuration chosen,
compared to Au+Au collisions. The tip-to-tip collisions leads to the largest
values of Nch,transverse energy (ET) and <pT>. The <e2> and its fluctuation
shows a rich centrality dependence, whereas not much variations are observed
for <e3> and its fluctuations. The U+U side-on-side collision configuration
provides maximum values of <e2> and minimum values of eccentricity
fluctuations, whereas for peripheral collisions and mid-central collisions
minimum values of <e2> and maximum value of eccentricity fluctuations are
observed for body-to-body configuration and the tip-to-tip configuration has
minimum value of <e2> and maximum value of eccentricity fluctuations for
central collisions. The calculated v2 closely correlates with the eccentricity
in the model. It is smallest for the body-to-body configuration in peripheral

central collisions. For peripheral collisions the v2 in U+U can be about 40%
larger than in Au+Au whereas for central collisions it can be a factor 2 higher

self-annihilation produces detectable gamma-ray emission. Here, we discuss the
possibility that an annihilation signal may arise near a compact object (e.g.,

enhancement of density, with a profile that falls off approximately as the

Rome and Paris. The three most luminous pixels either of the target star and
the two reference stars are used to evaluate the magnitude through differential
photometry. The main sources of errors are outlined. The system of Delta
Scorpii, a spectroscopic double star, has experienced a close periastron in
July 2011 within the outer atmospheres of the two giant components. The whole
luminosity of Delta Scorpii system increased from about Mv=1.8 to 1.65 peaking
around 5 to 15 July 2011, but there are significant rapid fluctuations of 0.2 -
0.3 magnitudes occurring in 20 days that seem to be real, rather than a
consequence of systematic errors due to the changes of reference stars and
observing conditions. This method is promising for being applied to other
bright variable stars like Betelgeuse and Antares. After August the magnitude
remained constant at Mv=1.8 until the last observation on October 16 made in
twilight from Rome.

$c_{{}_\Pi}(v):=(d(v,V_1),d(v,V_2),...,d(v,V_k)),$ where
$d(v,V_i)=\min\{d(v,x)|x\in V_i\}, 1\leq i\leq k$. If distinct vertices have
distinct color codes, then $f$ is called a locating coloring. The minimum
number of colors needed in a locating coloring of $G$ is the locating chromatic
number of $G$, denoted by $\Cchi_{{}_L}(G)$. In this paper, we study the
locating chromatic number of the join of graphs. We show that when $G_1$ and

$\Cchi_{{}_L}(G_1+G_2)=\Cchi_{{}_L}(G_1)+\Cchi_{{}_L}(G_2)$, where $G_1+G_2$ is
the join of $G_1$ and $G_2$. Also, we determine the locating chromatic numbers
of the join of paths, cycles and complete multipartite graphs.

magnetization oscillations in terahertz range. The fluctuation effect is

masses 8M_odot <= M <= 20M_odot end effective temperatures T_eff < 4000K are
shown to be unstable against radial pulsations in the fundamental mode. The
oscillation periods range between 45 and 1180 days. The pulsational instability
is due to the kappa-mechanism in the hydrogen and helium ionization zones.
Radial pulsations of stars with mass M < 15M_odot are strictly periodic with
the light amplitude Delta M_bol <= 0.5 mag. The pulsation amplitude increases
with increasing stellar mass and for M > 15M_odot the maximum expansion
velocity of outer layers is as high as one third of the escape velocity. The
mean radii of outer mass zones increase due to nonlinear oscillations by <= 30%
in comparison with the initial equilibrium. The approximate method (with
uncertainty of a factor of 1.5) to evaluate the mass of the pulsating red
supergiant with the known period of radial oscillations is proposed. The
approximation of the pulsation constant Q as a function of the mass-to-radius
ratio is given. Masses of seven galactic red supergiants are evaluated using

develop a protocol to discover hot Jupiters as well as Neptune-mass and
Earth-mass planets in the stellar habitable zone. When planets are not
discovered, our method can be used to quantify the probability that the lens
star does not have planets within specified ranges of the orbital separation
and mass ratio. Nearby close-orbit planets discovered by lensing can be subject
to follow-up observations to study the newly-discovered planets or to discover
other planets orbiting the same star. Careful study of the low-magnification
portions of lensing light curves should produce, in addition to the discoveries
of close-orbit planets, definite detections of wide-orbit planets through the
discovery of ""repeating"" lensing events. We show that events exhibiting
extremely high magnification can effectively be probed for planets in close,
intermediate, and wide distance regimes simply by adding several-time-per-night
monitoring in the low-magnification wings, possibly leading to gravitational
lensing discoveries of multiple planets occupying a broad range of orbits, from
close to wide, in a single planetary system.
