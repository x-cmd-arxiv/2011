remains elusive for wave turbulence of flexural waves at the surface of an thin
elastic plate. We report a direct measurement of the nonlinear timescale
$T_{NL}$ related to energy transfer between waves. This time scale is extracted
from the space-time measurement of the deformation of the plate by studying the
temporal dynamics of wavelet coefficients of the turbulent field. The central
hypothesis of the theory is the time scale separation between dissipative time
scale, nonlinear time scale and the period of the wave ($T_d>>T_{NL}>>T$). We
observe that this scale separation is valid in our system. The discrete modes
due to the finite size effects are responsible for the disagreement between
observations and theory. A crossover from continuous weak turbulence and
discrete turbulence is observed when the nonlinear time scale is of the same
order of magnitude as the frequency separation of the discrete modes. The
Kolmogorov-Zakharov energy cascade is then strongly altered and is frozen
before reaching the dissipative regime expected in the theory.

  arXiv:0706.1082",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Different mathematical methods have been applied to obtain the analytic
result for the massless triangle Feynman diagram yielding a sum of four
linearly independent hypergeometric functions of two variables $F_4$. These are
defined for especific regions of convergence for the ratios of the squares of
momentum variables. In this paper I work out the diagram and show that that
result, though mathematically sound, is not physically acceptable when it is
embedded in higher loops - meaning further momentum integrations - because it
misses a fundamental physical constraint imposed by the conservation of
momentum, which should reduce by one the total number of linearly independent
(l.i.) functions $F_4$ in the overall solution. Taking into account that the
momenta flowing along the three legs of the diagram are constrained by momentum
conservation, the number of overall l.i. functions that enter the most general
solution must reduce accordingly.
  To determine the exact structure and content of the analytic solution for the
three-point function that can be embedded in higher loops, I use the analogy
that exists between Feynman diagrams and electric circuit networks, in which
the electric current flowing in the network plays the role of the momentum
flowing in the lines of a Feynman diagram. This analogy is employed to define
exactly which three out of the four hypergeometric functions are relevant to
the analytic solution for the Feynman diagram. The analogy is built based on
the equivalence between electric resistance circuit networks of type ""Y"" and
""Delta"" in which flows a conserved current. The equivalence is established via
the theorem of minimum energy dissipation within circuits having these
structures.

The random graph process is defined as a sequence of random variables which
take values from the set of all possible digraphs over the node set. At each
time step, every node updates its state based on a Bernoulli trial, independent
in time and among different nodes: either averaging among the neighbor set
generated by the random graph, or sticking with its current state.
Connectivity-independence and arc-independence are introduced to capture the
fundamental influence of the random graphs on the consensus convergence.
Necessary and/or sufficient conditions are presented on the success
probabilities of the Bernoulli trials for the network to reach a global almost
sure consensus, with some sharp threshold established revealing a consensus
zero-one law. Convergence rates are established by lower and upper bounds of
the $\epsilon$-computation time. We also generalize the concepts of
connectivity/arc independence to their analogues from the $*$-mixing point of
view, so that our results apply to a very wide class of graphical models,
including the majority of random graph models in the literature, e.g.,
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, gossiping, and Markovian random graphs. We show that under
$*$-mixing, our convergence analysis continues to hold and the corresponding
almost sure consensus conditions are established. Finally, we further
investigate almost sure finite-time convergence of random gossiping algorithms,
and prove that the Bernoulli trials play a key role in ensuring finite-time
convergence. These results add to the understanding of the interplay between
random graphs, random computations, and convergence probability for distributed
information processing.

reach a global belief agreement under discrete-time or continuous-time
evolution. Each (directed) arc in the underlying communication graph is assumed
to be associated with a time-dependent weight function which describes the
strength of the information flow from one node to another. An arc is said to be
persistent if its weight function has infinite $\mathscr{L}_1$ or $\ell_1$ norm
for continuous-time or discrete-time belief evolutions, respectively. The graph
that consists of all persistent arcs is called the persistent graph of the
underlying network. Three necessary and sufficient conditions on agreement or
$\epsilon$-agreement are established, by which we prove that the persistent
graph fully determines the convergence to a common opinion in social networks.
It is shown how the convergence rates explicitly depend on the diameter of the
persistent graph. The results adds to the understanding of the fundamentals
behind global agreements, as it is only persistent arcs that contribute to the
convergence.

multi-photon systems in a partially entangled pure state, resorting to the
projection measurement on an additional photon. One party in quantum
communication first performs a parity-check measurement on her photon in an
N-photon system and an additional photon, and then she projects the additional
photon into an orthogonal Hilbert space for dividing the original $N$-photon
systems into two groups. In the first group, the N parties will obtain a subset
of $N$-photon systems in a maximally entangled state. In the second group, they
will obtain some less-entangled N-photon systems which are the resource for the
entanglement concentration in the next round. By iterating the entanglement
concentration process several times, the present ECP has the maximal success
probability which is just equivalent to the entanglement of the partially
entangled state. That is, this ECP is an optimal one.

this coupling, the idea of the coherent population trapping can be considered

the multiple frequency quantum oscillation pattern consistent with nodal

pseudogap observed by photoemission, optical conductivity, nuclear magnetic
resonance Knight shift, as well as other complementary diffraction, transport

studying a subclass of Baxter permutations. This subclass of Baxter

renormalization group (RG) in statistical physics. After reviewing the scaling
approach and Ginzburg-Landau theory for critical phenomena, Wilson's momentum
shell RG method is presented, and the critical exponents for the scalar Phi^4
model are determined to first order in an eps expansion about d_c = 4.
Subsequently, the technically more versatile field-theoretic formulation of the
perturbational RG for static critical phenomena is described. It is explained
how the emergence of scale invariance connects UV divergences to IR
singularities, and the RG equation is employed to compute the critical
exponents for the O(n)-symmetric Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory. The second part
is devoted to field theory representations of non-linear stochastic dynamical
systems, and the application of RG tools to critical dynamics. Dynamic critical
phenomena in systems near equilibrium are efficiently captured through Langevin
equations, and their mapping onto the Janssen-De Dominicis response functional,
exemplified by the purely relaxational models with non-conserved (model A) /
conserved order parameter (model B). The Langevin description and scaling
exponents for isotropic ferromagnets (model J) and for driven diffusive
non-equilibrium systems are also discussed. Finally, an outlook is presented to
scale-invariant phenomena and non-equilibrium phase transitions in interacting
particle systems. It is shown how the stochastic master equation associated
with chemical reactions or population dynamics models can be mapped onto
imaginary-time, non-Hermitian `quantum' mechanics. In the continuum limit, this
Doi-Peliti Hamiltonian is represented through a coherent-state path integral,
which allows an RG analysis of diffusion-limited annihilation processes and
phase transitions from active to inactive, absorbing states.

subtraction of a model of the smooth cluster emission, we find a number of
approximately radial surface brightness depressions which are not present in
simulated images and are seen in both the Chandra and XMM-Newton data. The
depressions are most strongly seen in the south of the cluster and have a
magnitude of around 4 per cent in surface brightness. We see these features in
both an energy band sensitive to the density (0.6 to 5 keV) and a band more
sensitive to the pressure (3.5 to 7.5 keV). Histograms of surface brightness in
the data, when compared to realisations of a smooth model, reveal stronger
surface brightness variations. We use the Delta-variance technique to
characterise the magnitude of the fluctuations as a function of length scale.
We find that the spectrum in the 0.6 to 5 keV band is flatter than expected for
Kolmogorov index fluctuations. If characterised by a power spectrum, on large
scales it would have an index around -1.7, rather than -3.7. The implied 3D
density fluctuations have a standard deviation of around 4 per cent. The
implied 3D pressure variations are at most 4 per cent. Most of the longer-scale
power in the density spectrum is contributed by the southern half of the

become a potentially powerful tool to search for planets around cool stars and

NIRSPEC at Keck II, we obtained spectra of eight late M-dwarfs (spectral types
M5.0-M8.0) during two or more observing epochs per target. These spectra were
taken with intermediate spectral resolving powers (R \sim 20,000) in the
J-band.
  Aims. We search for relative radial velocity variability in these late
M-dwarfs and test the NIRSPEC capability of detecting short period brown dwarf
and massive planetary companions around low-mass stars in the J-band (\approx
1.25 micron). Additionally, we reanalyzed the data of the M8-type star vB10

  Results. For the entire M-dwarf sample, we do not find any evidence of
relative RV variations induced by a short period brown dwarf or massive
planetary companion. The typical RV precision of the measurements is between
180 and 300 m/s, which is sufficient to detect hot Neptunes around M-dwarfs.
Also, we find that the spurious RV shift in Zapatero et al. (2009) of the star
VB10 was caused by asymmetries in the instrumental profile between different
observing epochs, which were not taken into account in their analysis.

$\Omega(E,m,L)$, and related microcanonical averages, for all allowed energies

reconstruction. We then present and test the efficiency of available methods

analyses. Noise- controlled estimates render far more plausible interpretations

to a Markov chain proposal in order to make the chain reversible with respect
to the target measure. We focus on cases where the proposal is either a

is invariant. Previous results in terms of scaling and diffusion limits
suggested that the pCN has a convergence rate that is independent of the
dimension while the RWM method has undesirable dimension-dependent behaviour.
We confirm this claim by exhibiting a dimension-independent Wasserstein
spectral gap for pCN algorithm for a large class of target measures. In our
setting this Wasserstein spectral gap implies an $L^2$-spectral gap. We use
both spectral gaps to show that the ergodic average satisfies a strong law of
large numbers, the central limit theorem and nonasymptotic bounds on the mean
square error, all dimension independent. In contrast we show that the spectral

study a subclass of mosaic floorplans called hierarchical floorplans of order
$k$ (abbreviated HFO-${k}$). A floorplan is HFO-$k$ if it can be obtained by
starting with a single rectangle and recursively embedding mosaic floorplans of
at most $k$ rooms inside the rooms of intermediate floorplans. When $k=2$ this
is exactly the class of slicing floorplans as the only distinct floorplans with
two rooms are a room with a vertical slice and a room with a horizontal slice
respectdeively. And embedding such a room is equivalent to slicing the parent
room vertically/horizontally. In this paper we characterize permutations
corresponding to the Abe-labeling of HFO-$k$ floorplans and also give an
algorithm for identification of such permutations in linear time for any
particular $k$. We give a recurrence relation for exact number of HFO-5
floorplans with $n$ rooms which can be easily extended to any $k$ also. Based
on this recurrence we provide a polynomial time algorithm to generate the
number of HFO-$k$ floorplans with $n$ rooms. Considering its application in
VLSI design we also give moves on HFO-$k$ family of permutations for
combinatorial optimization using simulated annealing etc. We also explore some
interesting properties of Baxter permutations which have a bijective
correspondence with mosaic floorplans.

Survey. We detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the S0s.
The mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 K, warmer than that found for
late-type galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. Including the non-detections, the mean
dust mass is log(Mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 Msun for the S0s and
elliptical galaxies respectively. The mean dust-to-stellar mass is
log(Mdust/Mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (S0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). Virtually all
the galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detections
of cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radio
emission all suggest that many ETGs contain a cool interstellar medium similar
to that in late-type galaxies. The mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for S0s is
approximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes of
the dust sources in the S0s are also much smaller. We show that the difference
cannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios or
environmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. The wide range in the
dust-to-stellar mass ratio for ETGs and the lack of a correlation between dust
mass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the ETGs detected
by Herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;
these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellar
masses of the ETGs. The Herschel observations tentatively suggest that in the
most massive ETGs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to the
evolution of the stellar populations.

proofs are independent of the QLLL. So these results also provide independent,
constructive proofs of the commutative QLLL itself, but strengthen it
significantly by giving an efficient algorithm for finding the state whose
existence is asserted by the QLLL. We give an application of the constructive
commutative QLLL to convergence of CP maps.
  We also extend these results to the non-commutative setting. However, our
proof of the general constructive QLLL relies on a conjecture which we are only
able to prove in special cases.

heating, it is not possible to conclude that magnetar cores are in a
non-superfluid state purely from high surface temperatures. From our interior
temperature evolutions and after accounting for proton superconductivity in the
core, we find that neutron superfluidity in the core occurs less than a few
hundred years after neutron star formation. This onset time is unaffected by
heating due to core field decay at fields < 10^16 G. Thus all known neutron
stars, including magnetars, without a core containing exotic particles, should
have a core of superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons.

observations of 20 nearby low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) with VLT/VISIR and the
preliminary analysis of a new sample of 10 low-luminosity Seyferts observed
with Gemini/Michelle. LLAGN are of great interest because these objects are the
most common among active galaxies, especially in the nearby universe. Studying
them in great detail makes it possible to investigate the AGN evolution over
cosmic timescale. Indeed, many LLAGN likely represent the final stage of an
AGN's lifetime. We show that even at low luminosities and accretion rates
nuclear unresolved MIR emission is present in most objects. Compared to lower
spatial resolution Spitzer/IRS spectra, the high-resolution MIR photometry
exhibits significantly lower fluxes and different PAH emission feature
properties in many cases. By using scaled Spitzer/IRS spectra of typical
starburst galaxies, we show that the star formation contribution to the 12
micron emission is minor in the central parsecs of most LLAGN. Therefore, the
observed MIR emission in the VISIR and Michelle data is most likely emitted by
the AGN itself, which, for higher luminosity AGN, is interpreted as thermal
emission from a dusty torus. Furthermore, the 12 micron emission of the LLAGN
is strongly correlated with the absorption corrected 2-10 keV luminosity and
the MIR--X-ray correlation found previously for AGN is extended to a range from
10^40 to 10^45 erg/s. This correlation is independent of the object type, and
in particular the low-luminosity Seyferts observed with Michelle fall exactly
on the power-law fit valid for brighter AGN. In addition, no dependency of the
MIR--X-ray ratio on the accretion rate is found. These results are consistent
with the unification model being applicable even in the probed low-luminosity

of UV-bright stars surrounding the M31 black hole. The center of the cluster is
marked by an extended source that is both brighter and redder than the other
point sources within P3; it is likely to be a blend of several bright stars. We
hypothesize that it marks the location of the M31 black hole. Both stellar
photometry and a surface brightness fluctuation analysis, show that the P3
stellar population is consistent with early-type main sequence stars formed in
a ~100 - ~200 Myr old starburst population. Evolutionary tracks of post early
asymptotic giant-branch stars, associated with late-stage evolution of an old
population, also traverse the U and U-B domain occupied by the P3 stars; but we
argue that only a few stars could be accounted for that way. PEAGB evolution is
very rapid, and there is no progenitor population of red giants associated with
P3. The result that P3 comprises young stars is consistent with inferences from
earlier HST observations of the integrated light of the cluster. Like the Milky
Way, M31 harbors a black hole closely surrounded by apparently young stars.

explosion, the stalled shock is unstable due to the standing accretion shock
instability (SASI). This instability induces large-scale non spherical
oscillations of the shock, which have crucial consequences on the dynamics and
the geometry of the explosion. While the existence of this instability has been
firmly established, its physical origin remains somewhat uncertain. Two
mechanisms have indeed been proposed to explain its linear growth. The first is
an advective-acoustic cycle, where the instability results from the interplay
between advected perturbations (entropy and vorticity) and an acoustic wave.
The second mechanism is purely acoustic and assumes that the shock is able to
amplify trapped acoustic waves. Several arguments favouring the
advective-acoustic cycle have already been proposed, however none was entirely
conclusive for realistic flow parameters. In this article we give two new
arguments which unambiguously show that the instability is not purely acoustic,
and should be attributed to the advective-acoustic cycle. First, we extract a
radial propagation timescale by comparing the frequencies of several unstable
harmonics that differ only by their radial structure. The extracted time
matches the advective-acoustic time but strongly disagrees with a purely
acoustic interpretation. Second, we present a method to compute purely acoustic
modes, by artificially removing advected perturbations below the shock. All
these purely acoustic modes are found to be stable, showing that the advected
wave is essential to the instability mechanism.

motivation is to alleviate the fine-tuning problem in supersymmetry with the
most dramatic consequence being a substantial increase in the mass of the
lightest Higgs boson as compared to the minimal supersymmetic model. We
investigate in this paper the constraints set by the LHC on such models. We

the data from the literature (a sample of 28 DLAs) and assuming the measured
core fraction at milliarcsecond scale to represent the gas covering factor, we
find that the HI gas in DLAs at z> 2 is predominantly constituted by WNM. The
detection rate of 21-cm absorption seems to be higher for systems with higher
N(HI) or metallicity. However, no clear correlation is found between the
integrated 21-cm optical depth (or spin temperature) and either N(HI),
metallicity or velocity spread of the low ionization species. There are 13 DLAs
in our sample for which high resolution optical spectra covering the expected
wavelength range of H_2 absorption are available. We report the detection of
H_2 molecules in the z_abs = 3.3871 21-cm absorber towards J0203+1134 (PKS
0201+113). In 8 cases, neither H_2 nor 21-cm absorption are detected. The lack
of 21-cm and H_2 absorption in these systems can be explained if most of the HI
in these DLAs originate from low density high temperature gas. In one case we
have a DLA with 21-cm absorption not showing H_2 absorption. In two cases, both
species are detected but do not originate from the same velocity component. In
the remaining 2 cases 21-cm absorption is not detected despite the presence of
H_2 with evidence for the presence of cold gas. All this is consistent with the
idea that the H_2 components seen in DLAs are compact (with sizes of < 15 pc)
and contain only a small fraction (i.e typically <10%) of the total N(HI)
measured in the DLAs.

the dynamically stable sectors, increasing with the angular momentum and
saturating for strong fields, whereas at finite temperature, entanglement is
non-zero just within a finite field or frequency window and no longer diverges.

domain. The thermal behavior of the gaussian quantum discord and its difference

almost linear time algorithm computing the terminal strongly connected
components (i.e. SCCs which do not reach any components but themselves).
""Almost linear"" here means that the complexity of the algorithm is linear in
the size of the hypergraph up to a factor alpha(n), where alpha is the inverse
of Ackermann function, and n is the number of vertices. Our motivation to study
this problem arises from a recent application of directed hypergraphs to
computational tropical geometry.
  We also discuss the problem of computing all SCCs. We establish a superlinear
lower bound on the size of the transitive reduction of the reachability
relation in directed hypergraphs, showing that it is combinatorially more
complex than in directed graphs. Besides, we prove a linear time reduction from
the well-studied problem of finding all minimal sets among a given family to
the problem of computing the SCCs. Only subquadratic time algorithms are known
for the former problem. These results strongly suggest that the problem of
computing the SCCs is harder in directed hypergraphs than in directed graphs.

current on a finite dimensional space, showing that the usual properties of
$(p,q)-$currents still hold, except for the existence of a Dolbeault
decomposition. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of a particular class of
complex spaces, whose structure allows us to give a structure theorem for
currents, solve the Cauchy-Riemann equation and characterize holomorphic
currents. In Section 5, we introduce the concept of bidimension of (global)
metric currents on a Banach space and relate it to the behaviour of the finite
dimensional projections of the currents. In section 6 we define a new class of
currents, the \emph{quasi-local} metric currents, which are usual metric
currents when restricted to bounded sets, and we give a definition of
$(p,q)-$current in this new class. The last Section shows how to employ these
newly defined quasi-local currents in order to obtain a solution to the
equation $\debar U=T$, when $T$ is of bidimension $(0,q)$ and its support is

always widely appreciated) that the relativity principle, combined with the
basic and fundamental physical assumptions of locality, linearity, and
isotropy, leads almost uniquely to either the Lorentz transformations of
special relativity or to Galileo's transformations of classical Newtonian
mechanics. Thus, if one wishes to entertain the possibility of Lorentz symmetry
breaking within the context of the class of local physical theories, then it
seems likely that one will have to abandon (or at the very least grossly
modify) the relativity principle. Working within the framework of local
physics, we reassess the notion of spacetime transformations between inertial
frames in the absence of the relativity principle, arguing that significant and
nontrivial physics can still be extracted as long as the transformations are at
least linear. An interesting technical aspect of the analysis is that the
transformations now form a groupoid/pseudo-group --- it is this technical point
that permits one to evade the von Ignatowsky argument. Even in the absence of a
relativity principle we can nevertheless deduce clear and compelling rules for
the transformation of space and time, rules for the composition of
3-velocities, and rules for the transformation of energy and momentum. As part
of the analysis we identify two particularly elegant and physically compelling
models implementing ""minimalist"" violations of Lorentz invariance --- in the
first of these minimalist models all Lorentz violations are confined to
carefully delineated particle physics sub-sectors, while the second minimalist
Lorentz-violating model depends on one free function of absolute velocity, but
otherwise preserves as much as possible of standard Lorentz invariant physics.

quantum channels from a sender in the future to a receiver in the past.
  The maximum probability of simulation is determined by causality and depends
on the amount and type (classical or quantum) of information that the channel
can transmit. We illustrate this dependence in several examples, including
ideal classical and quantum channels, measure-and-prepare channels, partial
trace channels, and universal cloning channels. For the simulation of partial
trace channels, we consider generalized teleportation protocols that take N
input copies of a pure state in the future and produce M < N output copies of
the same state in the past. In this case, we show that the maximum probability
of successful teleportation increases with the number of input copies, a
feature that was impossible in classical physics. In the limit of
asymptotically large N, the probability converges to the probability of
simulation for an ideal classical channel.
  Similar results are found for universal cloning channels from N copies to M >
N approximate copies, exploiting a time-reversal duality between universal
cloning and partial trace.

the UV flux is mainly controlled by age or metallicity parameters. Moreover, 2
mag of color spreads both in FUV - NUV and FUV - r appear to be ubiquitous
among any subsets in distance or luminosity. This implies that the UVX in ETGs
could be driven by yet another parameter which might be even more influential
than age or metallicity.

This group of ideas generalizes the theory of pseudoholomorphic curves in a
direction suggested by consideration of the kinds of compatible geometric
structures that appear in the realm of special holonomy as well as some of the
topological and analytic considerations that are essential to pseudoholomorphic
invariants. The first part presents the geometric framework of compatible
$n$-triads, from which follows naturally the definition of a multiholomorphic
mapping. Some of the general analytic and differential-geometric properties of
these maps are derived, including an energy identity which expresses a
multiholomorphic map as a minimizer in its homotopy class of the appropriate
$L^p$-energy. Some theorems confining the critical loci of such maps are
obtained as well as some Liouville-type theorems for maps with sufficient
regularity in the presence of curvature hypotheses. Finally, attention is
focused onto a special case of the theory which pertains to the calibrated
geometry of $\Gtwo$-manifolds.

restricted frequency to users in a certain space. Since our task is to minimize
the number of repeaters, a natural idea is enlarging coverage area. However,
coverage has restrictions. First, service area has to be divided economically
as repeater's coverage is limited. In this paper, our fundamental method is to
adopt seamless cellular network division. Second, underlying physics content in
frequency distribution problem is interference between two close frequencies.
Consequently, we choose a proper frequency width of 0.1MHz and a relevantly
reliable setting to apply one frequency several times.
  We make a few general assumptions to simplify real situation. For instance,
immobile users yield to homogenous distribution; repeaters can receive and
transmit information in any given frequency in duplex operation; coverage is
mainly decided by antenna height.
  Two models are built up to solve 1000 users and 10000 users situations
respectively. In order to utilize restricted frequency and PL code, three
stratified terms - ""cell"", ""cluster"", ""group"" - are introduced to describe the
models in detail. Under our analysis, 91 repeaters for 1000 users and 469
repeaters for 10000 users are viable results.
  Next, to test stability and sensitivity of models, we give total
consideration to the variation of sum of users, antenna height, and frequency
width and service radius. Evaluation about models is offered qualitatively.
Finally, two practical cases are put forward to gain a partial knowledge of
mountainous area. The brief method in dealing with mountains is classified
discussion in two ideal conditions. It may provide some constructive
suggestions to avoid shortcomings or take proper measures in similar locations.

demonstrate an exotic phenomenon that the direction of electromagnetic power
bends towards the normal when light is incident from arbitrary high refractive
index medium to \epsilon-near-zero metamaterial. Moreover, the direction of the
transmitted beam is close to the normal for all angles of incidence. In other
words, the electromagnetic power coming from different directions in air or

almost parallel to the normal upon entering the \epsilon-near-zero

find that $W^{(2)}$, the second Kaluza-Kelin (KK) state of the $W$ boson in the
minimal Universal Extra Dimension (mUED) model, can be a good candidate for
this signal, as its branching ratio into $\ell\nu$ is sizable. Moreover, nearly
degenerate KK mass spectra in the mUED model yield generically very soft SM
particle accompanying $W^{(2)}$ from the subsequent decays of the second KK
quarks and gluons. In a hadron collider, this indirect $W^{(2)}$ production is
difficult to distinguish from the $W^{(2)}$ single production. The involved
strong interactions make it more important than the single production. The
early LHC data on $\ell+\met$ signal for 1.1 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity is
shown insufficient to limit our model even with significant indirect production
of $W^{(2)}$. However, the results show that the present LHC 5.6 fb$^{-1}$ data

particularly useful in forensic imaging, where the extraction of minute details

additive noise. However, a unique solution may not be available because of the

been used. However, their performance is not good because the effect of noise

is computed for three mixtures each with 7-15 different compositions. We
observe that the nonlocal viscosity kernel is dependent on composition for
simple atomic mixtures for all the wave vectors studied here, however, for a
model polymer melt mixture the kernel is independent of composition for large
wave vectors. The deviation from ideal mixing is also studied. Here it is shown
that a Lennard-Jones mixture follows the ideal mixing rule surprisingly well
for a large range of wave vectors, whereas for both the Kob-Andersen mixture
and the polymer melt large deviations are found. Furthermore, for the polymer
melt the deviation is wave vector dependent such that there exists a critical
length scale at which the ideal mixing goes from under-estimating to
over-estimating the viscosity.

active contours, which is completely free of the costly re-initialization
procedure in level set evolution (LSE). A diffusion term is introduced into
LSE, resulting in a RD-LSE equation, to which a piecewise constant solution can
be derived. In order to have a stable numerical solution of the RD based LSE,
we propose a two-step splitting method (TSSM) to iteratively solve the RD-LSE
equation: first iterating the LSE equation, and then solving the diffusion
equation. The second step regularizes the level set function obtained in the
first step to ensure stability, and thus the complex and costly
re-initialization procedure is completely eliminated from LSE. By successfully
applying diffusion to LSE, the RD-LSE model is stable by means of the simple
finite difference method, which is very easy to implement. The proposed RD
method can be generalized to solve the LSE for both variational level set
method and PDE-based level set method. The RD-LSE method shows very good
performance on boundary anti-leakage, and it can be readily extended to high
dimensional level set method. The extensive and promising experimental results
on synthetic and real images validate the effectiveness of the proposed RD-LSE
approach.

K-user channel with or without common information is defined through two steps.
The first step is user virtualization: each user is divided into multiple
virtual sub-users according to a chosen rate-splitting strategy. This results
in an enhanced channel with a possibly larger number of users for which more
coding possibilities are available and for which common messages to any subset
of users can be encoded. Following user virtualization, the message of each
user in the enhanced model is coded using a chosen combination of coded
time-sharing, superposition coding and joint binning. A graph is used to
represent the chosen coding strategies: nodes in the graph represent codewords
while edges represent coding operations. This graph is used to construct a
graphical Markov model which illustrates the statistical dependency among
codewords that can be introduced by the superposition coding or joint binning.
Using this statistical representation of the overall codebook distribution, the
error probability of the code is shown to vanish via a unified analysis. The
rate bounds that define the achievable rate region are obtained by linking the
error analysis to the properties of the graphical Markov model. This proposed
framework makes it possible to numerically obtain an achievable rate region by
specifying a user virtualization strategy and describing a set of coding
operations. The union of these rate regions defines the maximum achievable rate
region of our unified coding strategy.

flow around black holes using a grid based finite difference method. We use the
Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity prescription. However, we compare with the results
obtained when all the three independent components of the viscous stress are
kept. We show that the centrifugal pressure supported shocks became weaker with
the inclusion of viscosity. The shock is formed farther out when the viscosity
is increased. When the viscosity is above a critical value, the shock
disappears altogether and the flow becomes subsonic and Keplerian everywhere
except in a region close to the horizon, where it remains supersonic. We also
find that as the viscosity is increased, the amount of outflowing matter in the
wind is decreased to less than a percentage of the inflow matter. Since the
post-shock region could act as a reservoir of hot electrons or the so-called
'Compton cloud', the size of which changes with viscosity, the spectral
properties are expected to depend on viscosity strongly: the harder states are
dominated by low-angular momentum and the low viscosity flow with a significant
outflows while the softer states are dominated by the high viscosity Keplerian
flow having very little outflows.

a simple algebraic expression and its simplistic nature leaves it open to
frequent re-expression An additional problem of the Drake equation is the
time-independence of its terms, which for example excludes the effects of the
physico-chemical history of the galaxy. Recently, it has been demonstrated that
the main shortcoming of the Drake equation is its lack of temporal structure,
i.e., it fails to take into account various evolutionary processes. In
particular, the Drake equation doesn't provides any error estimation about the
measured quantity. Here, we propose a first treatment of these evolutionary
aspects by constructing a simple stochastic process which will be able to
provide both a temporal structure to the Drake equation (i.e. introduce time in

coronal medium of the host stars. The net velocity of the particles impacting
on the planet determines the orientation of the shock. At the Earth's orbit,
the (mainly radial) solar wind is primarily responsible for the formation of a
shock facing towards the Sun. However, for close-in planets that possess high
Keplerian velocities and are frequently located at regions where the host
star's wind is still accelerating, a shock may develop ahead of the planet. If
the compressed material is able to absorb stellar radiation, then the signature
of bow shocks may be observed during transits. Bow-shock models have been
investigated in a series of papers (Vidotto et al. 2010, 2011,a,b; Llama et al.
2011) for known transiting systems. Once the signature of a bow-shock is
observed, one can infer the magnetic field intensity of the transiting planet.
Here, we investigate the potential to use this model to detect magnetic fields
of (hypothetical) planets orbiting inside the habitable zone of M-dwarf stars.
For these cases, we show, by means of radiative transfer simulations, that the
detection of bow-shocks of planets surrounding M-dwarf stars may be more
difficult than for the case of close-in giant planets orbiting solar-type
stars.

importance for understanding its evolution. SS Leporis, a symbiotic star
showing the Algol paradox and presenting clear evidence of ongoing mass
transfer, in which the donor has been thought to fill its Roche lobe, is a
target particularly suited to this kind of study. Aims. Since previous
spectroscopic and interferometric observations have not been able to fully
constrain the system morphology and characteristics, we go one step further to
determine its orbital parameters, for which we need new interferometric
observations directly probing the inner parts of the system with a much higher
number of spatial frequencies. Methods. We use data obtained at eight different
epochs with the VLTI instruments AMBER and PIONIER in the H- and K-bands. We
performed aperture synthesis imaging to obtain the first model-independent view
of this system. We then modelled it as a binary (whose giant is spatially
resolved) that is surrounded by a circumbinary disc. Results. Combining these
interferometric measurements with previous radial velocities, we fully
constrain the orbit of the system. We then determine the mass of each star and
significantly revise the mass ratio. The M giant also appears to be almost
twice smaller than previously thought. Additionally, the low spectral
resolution of the data allows the flux of both stars and of the dusty disc to
be determined along the H and K bands, and thereby extracting their
temperatures. Conclusions. We find that the M giant actually does not stricto
sensus fill its Roche lobe. The mass transfer is more likely to occur through
the accretion of an important part of the giant wind. We finally rise the
possibility for an enhanced mass loss from the giant, and we show that an
accretion disc should have formed around the A star.

of an energy filter into the wire in form of a double barrier system with the
resonant energy level tuned to the energy of the incident electron. We
demonstrate that the magnetic symmetry is restored when the inelastic

on Ising anyons is that quasiparticle braiding can only implement a finite
(non-universal) set of quantum operations. The computational power of this
restricted set of operations (often called stabilizer operations) has been
studied in quantum information theory, and it is known that no
quantum-computational advantage can be obtained without the help of an
additional non-stabilizer operation. Similarly, a bipartite two-qubit system
based on Ising anyons cannot exhibit non-locality (in the sense of violating a
Bell inequality) when only topologically protected stabilizer operations are
performed. To produce correlations that cannot be described by a local hidden
variable model again requires the use of a non-stabilizer operation. Using
geometric techniques, we relate the sets of operations that enable universal
quantum computing (UQC) with those that enable violation of a Bell inequality.
Motivated by the fact that non-stabilizer operations are expected to be highly
imperfect, our aim is to provide a benchmark for identifying UQC-enabling
operations that is both experimentally practical and conceptually simple. We
show that any (noisy) single-qubit non-stabilizer operation that, together with
perfect stabilizer operations, enables violation of the simplest two-qubit Bell
inequality can also be used to enable UQC. This benchmarking requires finding
the expectation values of two distinct Pauli measurements on each qubit of a
bipartite system.

identifying and accessing unoccupied spectrum bands. The games are designed to
be balanced and super-additive so that resource allocation is possible and
provides SUs with an incentive to cooperate and form the grand coalition. The
characteristic function of the game is derived based on the worths of SUs,
calculated according to the amount of work done for the coalition in terms of
reduction in uncertainty about PU activity. According to her worth in the
coalition, each SU gets a pay-off that is computed using various one-point
solutions such as Shapley value, \tau-value and Nucleolus. Depending upon their
data rate requirements for transmission, SUs use the earned pay-off to bid for
idle channels through a socially optimal Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction
mechanism. Simulation results show that, in comparison with other resource
allocation models, the proposed cooperative game-theoretic model provides the
best balance between fairness, cooperation and performance in terms of data

resorting to ad hoc hypotheses. Our main result is a bilateral collateralized
counterparty valuation adjusted pricing equation, which allows to price a deal

margining and funding costs in a coherent way. We find that the equation has a

control. Consequently, the estimation and comparison of treatment effects based
on the empirical distribution of the responses can be biased since the units
exposed to the various treatments could differ in important unknown
pretreatment characteristics, which are related to the response. An important
example studied in this article is the question of whether private schools
offer better quality of education than public schools. In order to address this
question, we use data collected in the year 2000 by OECD for the Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA). Focusing for illustration on scores in
mathematics of 15-year-old pupils in Ireland, we find that the raw average
score of pupils in private schools is higher than of pupils in public schools.
However, application of a newly proposed method for observational studies
suggests that the less able pupils tend to enroll in public schools, such that
their lower scores are not necessarily an indication of bad quality of the
public schools. Indeed, when comparing the average score in the two types of
schools after adjusting for the enrollment effects, we find quite surprisingly
that public schools perform better on average. This outcome is supported by the
methods of instrumental variables and latent variables, commonly used by
econometricians for analyzing and evaluating social programs.

that the toroidal field is confined to a torus which shrinks as \mu decreases,

on the poloidal-toroidal field ratio and diamagnetic shielding factor (by which
accretion reduces the observable external magnetic field, e.g. by burial).
These constraints will improve following gravitational-wave detections, with

monochromatic clique of order 1/2\log n. In this paper, we consider two
well-studied extensions of Ramsey's theorem.
  Improving a result of R\""odl, we show that there is a constant $c>0$ such
that every 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on \{2, 3,...,n\}
contains a monochromatic clique S for which the sum of 1/\log i over all
vertices i \in S is at least c\log\log\log n. This is tight up to the constant
factor c and answers a question of Erd\H{o}s from 1981.
  Motivated by a problem in model theory, V\""a\""an\""anen asked whether for
every k there is an n such that the following holds. For every permutation \pi
of 1,...,k-1, every 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on {1, 2,

a_{\pi(1)+1}-a_{\pi(1)}>a_{\pi(2)+1}-a_{\pi(2)}>...>a_{\pi(k-1)+1}-a_{\pi(k-1)}.
That is, not only do we want a monochromatic clique, but the differences
between consecutive vertices must satisfy a prescribed order. Alon and,
independently, Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal and Pach answered this question affirmatively.
Alon further conjectured that the true growth rate should be exponential in k.
We make progress towards this conjecture, obtaining an upper bound on n which
is exponential in a power of k. This improves a result of Shelah, who showed
that n is at most double-exponential in k.

that correspond to a large periodic outburst with the same period as the orbit,
26.5 days (phase \Phi), and a second periodicity of 1667 days (phase \Theta),
which modulates the orbital phase and amplitude of the large outburst. Analyses
of the radio spectral index revealed in LS I +61{\deg}303 the presence of the
critical transition typical for microquasars from optically thick emission
(related to a steady jet) to an optically thin outburst (related to a transient
jet), and found that it occurs at \Phi_{crit}, which is modulated by \Theta:
\Phi_{crit}=f(\Theta). We examine the possible implications of averaging high
energy data over large \Theta and \Phi intervals in the light of puzzling
published INTEGRAL results, which differ for different averaging of the data.
In microquasars, a simultaneous transition between two X-ray states occurs at
the switch from optically thick radio emission to an optically thin radio
outburst, from the low/hard to the steep power-law state. Assuming that the
same transition occurs in LS I +61{\deg}303 at \Phi_{crit}, we can show
qualitatively the effect of averaging high energy data on \Theta, by analysing
the effects of averaging radio spectral index data across the same \Theta
interval. We then model the two X-ray states, low/hard and steep power-law
state, and show quantitatively how their mixing can affect the results. When
folded over too large a \Theta interval, spectral data from INTEGRAL can yield
a false picture of the emission behaviour of the source along the orbit because
it may be mixing two spectral states. Furthermore, averaging the data along the
orbit may result in a dominant low/hard spectral state, which, for
insufficiently extended sampling, might appear without a cut-off.

{\sigma}_{JS} (or {\sigma}_{BS}) of the exchange couplings J_{i} (or the random
transverse fields B_{i}) is small, no long-time tail appears in the SAF. The
spin system undergoes a crossover from a central-peak behavior to a
collective-mode behavior, which is the dynamical characteristics of RTIM with
the bimodal disorder. However, when the standard deviation is large enough, the
system exhibits similar dynamics behaviors to those of the RTIM with the
Gaussian disorder, i.e., the system exhibits an enhanced central-peak behavior
for large {\sigma}_{JS} or a disordered behavior for large {\sigma}_{BS}. In
this instance, the long-time tails in the SAFs appear, i.e., C(t)\simt^{-2}.
Similar properties are obtained when the random variables (J_{i} or B_{i})
satisfy other distributions such as the double-exponential distribution and the

systematic study of the X-ray Baldwin effect (XBE, i.e. the anti-correlation
between narrow Fe K{\alpha} line EW and X-ray continuum luminosity for AGN
samples) with the highest spectral resolution currently available. We have
previously reported an anti-correlation with EW\proptoL(2-10 keV)^-0.22 in a
HEG sample, and the correlation is much weaker after averaging multiple
observations of individual AGNs (EW\proptoL(2-10 keV)^-0.13). This indicates
that rapid variation in X-ray continuum plays an important role in producing
the XBE, and such an effect should also be visible in individual AGNs. In this
paper, by normalizing the line EWs and continuum luminosities to the
time-averaged values for each AGN in our sample with multiple HEG observations,
we find a strong anti-correlation between EW and Lx (EW/<EW>\propto
(L/<L>)^-0.82+/-0.10), consistent with the XBE expected in an individual AGN if
the narrow line flux remains constant while the continuum varies. This is first
observational evidence that the Fe K{\alpha} line flux in a large sample of
AGNs lacks of a corresponding response to the continuum variation, supporting
that the narrow Fe-K line emission originates from a region far from the
nucleus. We then performed Monte-Carlo simulations to address whether the
global XBE can be produced by X-ray continuum variation solely, and found that
such interpretation of XBE cannot be ruled out statistically. One thus should
be very cautious before reaching any scientific conclusion based on an observed
XBE.

using the Taylor-Green vortex initial conditions and resolutions up to

method and Beale, Kato and Majda (BKM) theorem. A well-resolved acceleration of
the time-decay of the width of the analyticity strip $\delta(t)$ is observed at
the highest resolution for $3.7<t<3.85$ while preliminary 3D visualizations
show the collision of vortex sheets. The BKM criterium on the power-law growth
of supremum of the vorticity, applied on the same time-interval, is not
inconsistent with the occurrence of a singularity around $t \simeq 4$.
  These new findings lead us to investigate how fast the analyticity strip
width needs to decrease to zero in order to sustain a finite-time singularity
consistent with the BKM theorem. A new simple bound of the supremum norm of
vorticity in terms of the energy spectrum is introduced and used to combine the
BKM theorem with the analyticity-strip method. It is shown that a finite-time
blowup can exist only if $\delta(t)$ vanishes sufficiently fast at the
singularity time. In particular, if a power law is assumed for $\delta(t)$ then
its exponent must be greater than some critical value, thus providing a new
test that is applied to our $4096^3$ Taylor-Green numerical simulation.
  Our main conclusion is that the numerical results are not inconsistent with a
singularity but that higher-resolution studies are needed to extend the
time-interval on which a well-resolved power-law behavior of $\delta(t)$ takes
place, and check whether the new regime is genuine and not simply a crossover
to a faster exponential decay.

stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in a multi-dimensional geometry, and
accounting for nonlinear kinetic effects. In particular, our envelope equations
allow for the nonlinear reduction of the Landau damping rate, whose decrease
with the plasma wave amplitude depends on the rate of side-loss. Account is
also made of the variations in the extent of the plasma wave packet entailed by
the collisionless dissipation due to trapping. The dephasing between the
electron plasma wave (EPW) and the laser drive, as well as the self-focussing
of the plasma wave, both induced by the EPW nonlinear frequency shift, are also
included in our envelope equations. These equations are solved in a
multi-dimensional geometry using our code dubbed BRAMA, whose predictions
regarding the evolution of Raman reflectivity as a function of the laser
intensity are compared against previously published PIC results, thus
illustrating the ability of BRAMA simulations to provide the correct laser
threshold intensity for SRS, as well as the right order of magnitude of Raman
reflectivity above threshold.

southern hemispheres from January 1, 1945 to December 31, 2010 are used to
investigate the temporal variation of the rotational cycle length through the
continuous wavelet transformation analysis method. The auto-correlation
function analysis of daily hemispheric sunspot numbers shows that the southern
hemisphere rotates faster than the northern hemisphere. The results obtained
from the wavelet transformation analysis are: there exists no direct
relationship between the variation trend of the rotational cycle length and the
variation trend of solar activity in the two hemispheres; the rotational cycle
length of both hemispheres has no significant period appearing at the 11 years,
but has significant period of about 7.6 years. Analysis concerning the solar
cycle dependence of the rotational cycle length shows that in the whole disk
and the northern hemisphere acceleration seems to appear before the minimum
time of solar activity. Furthermore, the cross-correlation study indicates that
the rotational cycle length of the two hemispheres has different phases, and
the rotational cycle length of the whole disk as well as the northern and
southern hemispheres also has phase shifts with the corresponding solar
activity. What's more, the temporal variation of North-South (N-S) asymmetry of
the rotational cycle length is also studied; it displays the same variation
trend as the N-S asymmetry of solar activity in a solar cycle as well as in the
considered time interval, and it has two significant periods of 7.7 and 17.5
years. Moreover, the N-S asymmetry of the rotational cycle length and the N-S
asymmetry of solar activity are highly correlated. It's inferred that the
northern hemisphere should rotate faster at the beginning of solar cycle 24.

fermion gases with fixed total z-component of angular momentum, J_z, and at
high density for the simplest form of non-commutativity involving constant
spatial commutators. Analytic expressions for the entropy and pressure are
found. The entropy exhibits non-extensive behaviour while the pressure reveals
the presence of incompressibility in two, but not in three dimensions.
Remarkably, for two-dimensional systems close to the incompressible density,
the entropy is proportional to the square root of the system size, i.e., for
such systems the number of microscopic degrees of freedom is determined by the
circumference, rather than the area (size) of the system. The absence of
incompressibility in three dimensions, and subsequently also the absence of a
scaling law for the entropy analogous to the one found in two dimensions, is
attributed to the form of the non-commutativity used here, the breaking of the
rotational symmetry it implies and the subsequent constraint on J_z, rather
than the angular momentum J. Restoring the rotational symmetry while
constraining the total angular momentum J seems to be crucial for
incompressibility in three dimensions. We briefly discuss ways in which this
may be done and point out possible obstacles.

impact of multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA

\textit{exclusive law}. This paper does the equivalent for the three-way

same 4-PSK constellation, every such network coding map that satisfies the
exclusive law can be represented by a Latin Cube of Second Order. The network
code map used by the relay for the BC phase is explicitly obtained and is aimed

Japanese Hinode mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Vacuum
Tower Telescope (VTT) at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain during the
time period from 2010 November 18-23. Horizontal proper motions were derived
from G-band and Ca II H images, whereas line-of-sight velocities were extracted
from VTT Echelle H-alpha 656.28 nm spectra and Fe I 630.25 nm spectral data of
the Hinode/Spectro-Polarimeter, which also provided three-dimensional magnetic
field information. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board SDO provided
continuum images and line-of-sight magnetograms as context for the
high-resolution observations for the entire disk passage of the active region.
  We have performed a quantitative study of photospheric and chromospheric flow
fields in and around decaying sunspots. In one of the trailing sunspots of
active region NOAA 11126, we observed moat flow and moving magnetic features
(MMFs), even after its penumbra had decayed. We also noticed a superpenumbral
structure around this pore. MMFs follow well-defined, radial paths from the
spot all the way to the border of a supergranular cell surrounding the spot. In
contrast, flux emergence near the other sunspot prevented it from establishing
such well ordered flow patterns, which could even be observed around a tiny
pore of just 2 Mm diameter. After the disappearance of the sunspots/pores a
coherent patch of abnormal granulation remained at their location, which was
characterized by more uniform horizontal proper motions, low divergence values,
and diminished photospheric Doppler velocities. This region, thus, differs
significantly from granulation and other areas covered by G-band bright points.
We conclude that this peculiar flow pattern is a signature of sunspot decay and
the dispersal of magnetic flux.

confirmed that Jovian planets migrate inward via several potential mechanisms.
We present empirical constraints on planet migration halting mechanisms. We
compute model density functions of close-in exoplanets in the orbital
semi-major axis - stellar mass plane to represent planet migration that is
halted via several mechanisms, including the interior 1:2 resonance with the
magnetospheric disk truncation radius, the interior 1:2 resonance with the dust
sublimation radius, and several scenarios for tidal halting. The models differ
in the predicted power law dependence of the exoplanet orbital semi-major axis
as a function stellar mass, and thus we also include a power law model with the
exponent as a free parameter. We use a Bayesian analysis to assess the model
success in reproducing empirical distributions of confirmed exoplanets and
Kepler candidates that orbit interior to 0.1 AU. Our results confirm a
correlation of the halting distance with stellar mass. Tidal halting provides
the best fit to the empirical distribution of confirmed Jovian exoplanets at a
statistically robust level, consistent with the Kozai mechanism and the
spin-orbit misalignment of a substantial fraction of hot Jupiters. For Kepler
candidates, which have a more restricted range in stellar mass compared to
confirmed planets, we are unable to discern between the tidal dissipation and
magnetospheric disk truncation braking mechanisms at a statistically
significant level. The power law model favors exponents in the range of
0.38-0.9. This is larger than that predicted for tidal halting (0.23-0.33),
which suggests that additional physics may be missing in the tidal halting
theory.

agreement with recent results obtained using WMAP and Planck data, confirming
that SZ and X-ray observations of massive clusters detect the same amount of

configurations with two flavors of mass-degenerate Chirally Improved sea
quarks. The calculations are performed on seven ensembles of lattice size
16^3x32 at three different gauge couplings and with pion masses ranging from
250 to 600 MeV. To reliably extract excited states, we use the variational
method with an interpolator basis containing both gaussian and derivative quark
sources. Both conventional and exotic channels up to spin 2 are considered.
Strange quarks are treated within the partially quenched approximation. For
kaons we investigate the mixing of interpolating fields corresponding to
definite C-parity in the SU(3) limit. This enlarged basis allows for an
improved determination of the low-lying kaon spectrum. In addition to masses we
also extract the ratio of the pseudoscalar decay constants of the kaon and pion
and obtain F_K/F_\pi=1.215(41). The results presented here include some
ensembles from previous publications and the corresponding results supersede
the previously published values.

dramatically by cooling or compression. Many liquids have been shown to obey
power-law density scaling, according to which the relaxation time is a function
of density to some power over temperature. We show that power-law density
scaling breaks down for larger density variations than usually studied. This is
demonstrated by simulations of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture
and two molecular models, as well as by experimental results for two van der
Waals liquids. A more general form of density scaling is derived, which is
consistent with results for all the systems studied. An analytical expression
for the scaling function for liquids of particles interacting via generalized
Lennard-Jones potentials is derived and shown to agree very well with
simulations. This effectively reduces the problem of understanding the viscous
slowing down from being a quest for a function of two variables to a search for
a single-variable function.

for special relativity, an ""absolute motion"" might be detectable. We summarize
a scalar theory of gravity with a such ""ether"", which starts from a tentative
interpretation of gravity as a pressure force. The theory also admits that our
physical standards of space and time are affected by gravitation similarly as
they are affected by a uniform motion. General motion is governed by an
extension of Newton's second law to the curved space-time which is thus
obtained. Together with the scalar field equation of the theory, this leads to
a true conservation equation for the total energy. The law of motion also leads
to an alternative 4-component equation governing the dynamics of a continuum in
terms of its energy-momentum tensor. That new equation implies that mass
conservation is obtained as a limiting behaviour for a weak and slowly varying
gravitational field and/or at a low pressure. In the presence of the Lorentz
force field, the new dynamical equation gives the second group of the
gravitationally-modified Maxwell equations in the investigated theory. This is
consistent with the geometrical optics of the theory as governed by the
proposed extension of Newton's second law. The theory has the correct Newtonian
limit; it predicts Schwarzschild's exterior metric of general relativity and
geodesic motion in the static situation with spherical symmetry. A
post-Newtonian approximation of this theory shows that no preferred-frame
effect occurs for photons at the (first) post-Newtonian approximation. It is
argued that the existence of preferred-frame effects in celestial mechanics,
comparable in magnitude with the ""relativistic"" effects, does not a priori
invalidate the theory.

been shown to go beyond the framework of the thermodynamic description in a
number of cases. The principles of the theory of quantum-thermal fluctuations
of effective macroparameters and their correlations have been formulated. The
theory satisfies the applicability conditions of equilibrium thermodynamics and
is based on effective macroparameters, which take the integral stochastic
action of the environment into account at any temperatures. The correlator of
conjugate macroparameters, namely, the effective entropy and the effective
temperature, has been calculated. The correlator was found to be proportional
to the effective action which characterizes the stochastic environment. The
pair correlators for the conjugate effective parameters entropy-temperature and
coordinate-momentum have been demonstrated to depend linearly on the effective
action, with their minimum values being determined by Planck's constant.
