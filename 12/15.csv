$\GL(2,\bbR)$, the underlying locally homogeneous geometry is highly

Earth that is falling into the accretion zone of Sgr A*. Our observations
tightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost

in 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably
mainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational

probe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of the
super-massive black hole. The kilo-electronvolt X-ray emission of Sgr A* may
brighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. There may also be a
giant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and its

and reflectors can be combined in the absence of sun tracking to build
three-dimensional photovoltaic (3DPV) structures that can generate measured
energy densities (energy per base area, kWh/m2) higher by a factor of 2-20 than
stationary flat PV panels, versus an increase by a factor of 1.3-1.8 achieved
with a flat panel using dual-axis sun tracking(6). The increased energy density
is countered by a higher solar cell area per generated energy for 3DPV compared
to flat panel design (by a factor of 1.5-4 in our conditions), but accompanied
by a vast range of improvements. 3DPV structures are steadier sources of solar
energy generation at all latitudes: they can double the number of peak power
generation hours and dramatically reduce the seasonal, latitude and weather
variations of solar energy generation compared to a flat panel design.
Self-supporting 3D shapes can create new schemes for PV installation and the
increased energy density can facilitate the use of cheaper thin film materials
in area-limited applications. Our findings suggest that harnessing solar energy
in three dimensions can open new avenues towards Terawatt-scale generation.

opportunity to study in detail the dynamics and physical conditions of distant

these disks form so close to their host black holes and under what condition
they form stars in a tidally stressed environment. We argue that disk formation
around a massive black hole is due to partial accretion of extended molecular
clouds that temporarily pass through the central region of the Galaxy. The
cancellation of angular momentum of the gravitationally focused gas naturally
creates a compact gaseous disk. The disk can potentially become gravitationally
unstable and form stars. We apply these ideas to explain the origin of
sub-parsec megamaser disks found in the nuclei of Seyfert 2 galaxies. We show
that an empirical scaling relation between the mass of the black hole and the
size of the disk can be understood in the context of the cloud capture
scenario. We conclude that the stellar and gas disks found in our Galactic
center act as a bridge to further our understanding of more distant mega-maser

dynamical processes observed at close-range and in real-time in planetary
rings. We review the known ring systems of the four giant planets, as well as
the prospects for ring systems yet to be discovered. We then review planetary
rings by type. The main rings of Saturn comprise our system's only dense broad
disk and host many phenomena of general application to disks including spiral
waves, gap formation, self-gravity wakes, viscous overstability and normal
modes, impact clouds, and orbital evolution of embedded moons. Dense narrow
rings are the primary natural laboratory for understanding shepherding and
self-stability. Narrow dusty rings, likely generated by embedded source bodies,
are surprisingly found to sport azimuthally-confined arcs. Finally, every known
ring system includes a substantial component of diffuse dusty rings. Planetary
rings have shown themselves to be useful as detectors of planetary processes
around them, including the planetary magnetic field and interplanetary
impactors as well as the gravity of nearby perturbing moons. Experimental rings
science has made great progress in recent decades, especially numerical
simulations of self-gravity wakes and other processes but also laboratory
investigations of coefficient of restitution and spectroscopic ground truth.
The age of self-sustained ring systems is a matter of debate; formation
scenarios are most plausible in the context of the early solar system, while
signs of youthfulness indicate at least that rings have never been static

regularized action. The origin of the divergence has been previously understood
in terms of a conformal anomaly for surface observables in the CFT. Turning to
the gauge theory, a similar picture is found in d = 5 SYM. The divergence and
its coefficient can be recovered for general smooth loops by summing the
leading divergences in the analytic continuation of dimensional regularization
of planar rainbow/ladder diagrams. These diagrams are finite in 5 - epsilon
dimensions. The interpretation is that the Wilson loop is renormalized by a
factor containing this leading divergence of six-dimensional origin, and also
subleading divergences, and that the remaining part of the Wilson loop
expectation value is a finite, scheme-dependent quantity. We substantiate this
claim by showing that the interacting diagrams at one loop are finite in our

topological properties of these fractional Chern insulators. When a partially

delineates a hyperbolic umilic diffraction catastrophe, consisting of a cusped

described uniformly by a hyperbolic umilic canonical integral which is

the occurrence of mutations. Such structure is governed by a random-graph

density and the dynamics of mutation. We contribute two further modifications
to the theory, one to account for the fact that different loci in a genotype
may be differently susceptible to the occurrence of mutations, the other to
allow for a more plausible description of the transition from adaptation to
degeneracy of the quasispecies as p is increased. We give analytical and
simulation results for the usual case of binary genotypes, assuming the fitness
landscape in which a genotype's fitness decays exponentially with its Hamming
distance to the wild type. These results support the theory's assertions
regarding the adaptation of the quasispecies to the fitness landscape and also
its possible demise as a function of p.

supersonic shock waves, developed by stellar winds, should favor shock

to the assumed MC model. To complement such model-dependent searches, we
propose an algorithm based on semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques,
which does not require a MC training sample for the signal data. We first model
the background using a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. We then search for
deviations from this model by fitting to the observations a mixture of the
background model and a number of additional Gaussians. This allows us to
perform pattern recognition of any anomalous excess over the background. We
show by a comparison to neural network classifiers that such an approach is a
lot more robust against misspecification of the signal MC than supervised
classification. In cases where there is an unexpected signal, a neural network
might fail to correctly identify it, while anomaly detection does not suffer
from such a limitation. On the other hand, when there are no systematic errors
in the training data, both methods perform comparably.

model on square lattice around the maximally frustrated regime ($J_2\sim
0.5J_1$) has been debated for decades. Here we study this model using the
cluster update algorithm for tensor product states (TPSs). The ground state
energies at finite sizes and in the thermodynamic limit (with finite size
scaling) are in good agreement with exact diagonalization study. Through finite
size scaling of the spin correlation function, we find the critical point
$J_2^{c_1}=0.572(5)J_1$ and critical exponents $\nu=0.50(8)$, $\eta_s=0.28(6)$.
In the range of $0.572 < J_2/J_1 \leqslant 0.6 $ we find a paramagnetic ground
state with exponentially decaying spin-spin correlation. Up to $24\times 24$
system size, we observe power law decaying dimer-dimer and plaquette-plaquette
correlations with an anomalous plaquette scaling exponent $\eta_p=0.24(1)$ and
an anomalous columnar scaling exponent $\eta_c=0.28(1)$ at $J_2/J_1=0.6$. These
results are consistent with a potential gapless $U(1)$ spin liquid phase.
However, since the $U(1)$ spin liquid is unstable due to the instanton effect,
a VBS order with very small amplitude might develop in the thermodynamic limit.
Thus, our numerical results strongly indicate a deconfined quantum critical
point (DQCP) at $J_2^{c_1}$. Remarkably, all the observed critical exponents
are consistent with the $J-Q$ model.

top-heavy when the star-formation rate density surpasses about 0.1Msun/(yr
pc^3) on a pc scale and it may become increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing
metallicity and in increasingly massive early-type galaxies. It declines quite
steeply below about 0.07Msun with brown dwarfs (BDs) and very low mass stars
having their own IMF. The most massive star of mass mmax formed in an embedded
cluster with stellar mass Mecl correlates strongly with Mecl being a result of
gravitation-driven but resource-limited growth and fragmentation induced
starvation. There is no convincing evidence whatsoever that massive stars do
form in isolation. Various methods of discretising a stellar population are
introduced: optimal sampling leads to a mass distribution that perfectly
represents the exact form of the desired IMF and the mmax-to-Mecl relation,
while random sampling results in statistical variations of the shape of the
IMF. The observed mmax-to-Mecl correlation and the small spread of IMF
power-law indices together suggest that optimally sampling the IMF may be the
more realistic description of star formation than random sampling from a
universal IMF with a constant upper mass limit. Composite populations on galaxy
scales, which are formed from many pc scale star formation events, need to be
described by the integrated galactic IMF. This IGIMF varies systematically from
top-light to top-heavy in dependence of galaxy type and star formation rate,
with dramatic implications for theories of galaxy formation and evolution.

the lifetime of its metastable vacua. The dynamical resolution of the arrow of

using soft-collinear effective theory, this generates the complete singular
distribution for jet thrust, the sum of the jet masses, at two-loop order. The
result is in excellent agreement with full QCD. The integrated jet thrust
distribution is found to depend in an intricate way on both the finite jet cone
size, R, and the jet veto scale. The result clarifies the structure of the
potentially large logarithms (both global and non- global) which arise in jet

that, in the small R limit, there is a precise and simple correspondence
between the non-global contribution to the integrated jet thrust distribution

coming from the foreground Galactic cirrus. Thanks to the very large extension

accretion disk becomes unhidden by the non-thermal jet radiation, allowing to
estimate the black hole mass and the accretion rate. In turn, this highlights
the connection between the disk and the jet. Since the highest power blazars

be more appropriate than the Fermi/LAT to detect them.

Relativity (GR) in the strong-field. We study whether generic scalar-tensor
(ST) theories can be further constrained with EMRIs. We show that in the EMRI
limit, all such theories universally reduce to massive or massless Brans-Dicke
theory and that black holes do not emit dipolar radiation to all orders in
post-Newtonian (PN) theory. For massless theories, we calculate the scalar
energy flux in the Teukolsky formalism to all orders in PN theory and fit it to
a high-order PN expansion. We derive the PN ST corrections to the Fourier
transform of the gravitational wave response and map it to the parameterized
post-Einsteinian framework. We use the effective-one-body framework adapted to
EMRIs to calculate the ST modifications to the gravitational waveform. We find
that such corrections are smaller than those induced in the early inspiral of
comparable-mass binaries, leading to projected bounds on the coupling that are
worse than current Solar System ones. Brans-Dicke theory modifies the
weak-field, with deviations in the energy flux that are largest at small
velocities. For massive theories, superradiance can lead to resonances in the
scalar energy flux that can lead to floating orbits outside the innermost
stable circular orbit and that last until the supermassive black hole loses
enough mass and spin-angular momentum. If such floating orbits occur in the
frequency band of LISA, they would lead to a large dephasing (~1e6 rads),
preventing detection with GR templates. A detection that is consistent with GR
would then rule out floating resonances at frequencies lower than the lowest
observed frequency, allowing for the strongest constraints yet on massive ST

nature of the effective action is shown by proving that it must be either
double-trace, closing in on itself under successive integrations, or have an
infinite series of multi-trace terms. Focusing on composite scalar operator
renormalisation, we relate the Callan-Symanzik equation, the flow of the scalar
anomalous dimension and the multi-trace beta functions to their dual RG flows
in the bulk. Establishing physical renormalisation conditions on the behaviour
of the large-$N$ anomalous dimension then enables us to extract the energy
scales. Examples of pure AdS, GPPZ flow, black brane in AdS, M2 and M5 branes
are studied before we generalise our results to arbitrary numbers of mass and
thermal deformations of an ultra-violet CFT. Relations between the undeformed

Natural selection favors individual contribution to public goods only when some
benefit to the individual offsets the cost of contribution. Problems of sex
ratio, parasite virulence, microbial metabolism, punishment of noncooperators,
and nearly all aspects of sociality have been analyzed as public goods shaped
by kin and group selection. Here, I develop two general aspects of the public
goods problem that have received relatively little attention. First, variation
in individual resources favors selfish individuals to vary their allocation to
public goods. Those individuals better endowed contribute their excess
resources to public benefit, whereas those individuals with fewer resources
contribute less to the public good. Thus, purely selfish behavior causes
individuals to stratify into upper classes that contribute greatly to public
benefit and social cohesion and to lower classes that contribute little to the
public good. Second, if group success absolutely requires production of the
public good, then the pressure favoring production is relatively high. By
contrast, if group success depends weakly on the public good, then the pressure
favoring production is relatively weak. Stated in this way, it is obvious that
the role of baseline success is important. However, discussions of public goods
problems sometimes fail to emphasize this point sufficiently. The models here
suggest simple tests for the roles of resource variation and baseline success.
Given the widespread importance of public goods, better models and tests would
greatly deepen our understanding of many processes in biology and sociality.

hosts a luminous obscured quasar in its northern nucleus. Here we present two
long-slit Magellan LDSS-3 spectra that reveal a pair of symmetric ~10 kpc-size
outflows emerging from this nucleus, with observed expansion velocities of ~250
km/s in projection. We present a kinematic model of these outflows and argue
that the deprojected physical velocities of expansion are likely ~1000 km/s and
that the kinetic energy of the expanding shells is likely 10^44-10^45 erg/s,
with an absolute minimum of >10^42 erg/s. Although a radio counterpart is
detected at 1.4GHz, it is faint enough that the quasar is considered to be
radio-quiet by all standard criteria, and there is no evidence of extended
emission due to radio lobes, whether aged or continuously powered by an ongoing
jet. We argue that the likely level of star formation is probably insufficient
to power the observed energetic outflow and that SDSS J1356+1026 makes a strong
case for radio-quiet quasar feedback. In further support of this hypothesis,
polarimetric observations show that the direction of quasar illumination is
coincident with the direction of the outflow.

classical background geometries as quantum Bose-condensates with large
occupation numbers of soft gravitons. We show that among all possible sources
of a given physical length, $N$ is maximized by the black hole and coincides
with its entropy. The emerging quantum mechanical picture of a black hole is
surprisingly simple and fully parameterized by $N$. The black hole is a leaky
bound-state in form of a cold Bose-condensate of $N$ weakly-interacting soft
gravitons of wave-length $ \sqrt{N}$ times the Planck length and of quantum
interaction strength 1/N. Such a bound-state exists for an arbitrary $N$. This
picture provides a simple quantum description of the phenomena of Hawking
radiation, Bekenstein entropy as well as of non-Wilsonian UV-self-completion of
Einstein gravity. We show that Hawking radiation is nothing but a quantum
depletion of the graviton Bose-condensate, which despite the zero temperature
of the condensate produces a thermal spectrum of temperature $T \, = \,
1/\sqrt{N}$. The Bekenstein entropy originates from the exponentially growing
with $N$ number of quantum states. Finally, our quantum picture allows to
understand classicalization of deep-UV gravitational scattering as $2

the black holes and solitons, such as a t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole. Both objects
represent Bose-condensates of $N$ soft bosons of wavelength $\sqrt{N}$ and

ionisation fraction to drive turbulence in a disc. The inner parts of the disc
around a young stellar object are sufficiently hot to be thermally ionised.
Further out, cosmic rays ionise the surface layers and a dead zone forms at the
mid-plane where the disc is too cool for the MRI to operate. The surface
density in the turbulent active layer is often assumed to be constant with
radius because the cosmic rays penetrate a constant layer. However, if a
critical magnetic Reynolds number, Re_{M,crit}, is used to determine the extent
of the dead zone, the surface density in the layer generally increases with
radius. For small critical magnetic Reynolds number of order 1, the constant
layer approximation may be a reasonable fit. However, MHD simulations suggest
the critical magnetic Reynolds number may be much larger, of order 10^4.
Analytical fits for the surface density in the magnetic active layer show that
\Sigma_m \propto Re_{M,crit}^{-2} R^{9/2} T^{\,2}$, at temperature T and radius
R, are a good fit for higher critical magnetic Reynolds number. For the
metallicity variation between our galaxy, the LMC and the SMC, there should be
no significant difference in the extent of the dead zone. Observations suggest
an increase in the lifetime of the disc with decreasing metallicity that cannot
be explained by the dead zone structure (ignoring possible differences in dust

$\exp(-\Lqcd R)$ when the Minkowski space-time ${\cal R}_{3,1}$ is replaced by
a large but finite manifold with a size $R$. Such a behaviour is consistent
with other QFT-based computations when power like corrections are due to
nontrivial properties of topological sectors of the theory. In holographic
description such a behaviour is due to massless Ramond-Ramond (RR) field living
in the bulk of multidimensional space when power like corrections is a natural
outcome of massless RR field. In many respects the phenomenon is similar to the
Aharonov -Casher effect when the ""modular electric field"" can penetrate into a
superconductor where the electric field is exponentially screened. The role of
""modular operator"" from Aharonov -Casher effect is played by large gauge

First,
an individual gains by outcompeting its neighbors for local resources. Second,

productivity of the group. The essence of sociality arises from the tension
between selfish gains against neighbors and the associated loss that
selfishness imposes by degrading the efficiency of the group. Without some
force to modulate selfishness, the natural tendencies of self interest
typically degrade group performance to the detriment of all. This is the
tragedy of the commons. Kin selection provides the most widely discussed way in
which the tragedy is overcome in biology. Kin selection arises from behavioral
associations within groups caused either by genetical kinship or by other
processes that correlate the behaviors of group members. Here, I emphasize
demography as a second factor that may also modulate the tragedy of the commons
and favor cooperative integration of groups. Each act of selfishness or
cooperation in a group often influences group survival and fecundity over many
subsequent generations. For example, a cooperative act early in the growth
cycle of a colony may enhance the future size and survival of the colony. This
time-dependent benefit can greatly increase the degree of cooperation favored
by natural selection, providing another way in which to overcome the tragedy of
the commons and enhance the integration of group behavior. I conclude that
analyses of sociality must account for both the behavioral associations of kin
selection theory and the demographic consequences of life history theory.

ratios depending on the momenta of four external partons, which would have to

complex distributions of charges and to reduce the cost of computing
interactions between such distributions. However, practical applications that
typically retain only a few leading terms may suffer from unacceptable loss of
accuracy in the near-field. We propose an alternative approach for
approximating electrostatic charge distributions, Optimal Physical Multipoles
(OPMs), which optimally represent the original charge distribution with a set
of point charges. By construction, approximation of electrostatic potential
based on OPMs retains many of the useful properties of the corresponding point
multipole expansion, including the same asymptotic behavior of the approximate
potential for a given multipole order. At the same time, OPMs can be
significantly more accurate in the near field: up to 5 times more accurate for
some of the charge distributions tested here which are relevant to biomolecular
modeling. Unlike point multipoles, for point charge distributions the OPM
always converges to the original point charge distribution at finite order.
Furthermore, OPMs may be more computationally efficient and easier to implement
into existing molecular simulations software packages than approximation
schemes based on point multipoles. In addition to providing a general framework
for computing OPMs to any order, closed-form expressions for the lowest order
OPMs (monopole and dipole) are derived. Thus, for some practical applications

be avoided as the ion is excited in the dark zone of the beam at zero electric

PAHs, C60, and H2 superposed on a dust continuum. These emission components
exhibit distinct spatial distributions: with increasing distance from the
illuminating star, we observe the PAH emission followed by the dust continuum
emission and the H2 emission. The C60 emission is located closest to the
illuminating star in the south while in the north, it seems to be associated
with the H/H2 transition. Emission from PAHs and PAH-related species produce
features at 15.8, 16.4, 17.4, and 17.8 um and the 15-18 um plateau. These
different PAH features show distinct spatial distributions. The 15.8 um band
and 15-18 um plateau correlate with the 11.2 um PAH band and with each other,
and are attributed to large, neutral PAHs. Conversely, the 16.4 um feature
correlates with the 12.7 um PAH band, suggesting that both arise from species
that are favored by the same conditions that favor PAH cations. The PAH
contribution to the 17.4 um band is displaced towards the illuminating star
with respect to the 11.2 and 12.7 um emission and is assigned to doubly ionized
PAHs and/or a subset of cationic PAHs. The spatial distribution of the 17.8 um
band suggests it arises from both neutral and cationic PAHs. In contrast to
their intensities, the profiles of the PAH bands and the 15-18 um plateau do
not vary spatially. Consequently, we conclude that the carrier of the 15-18 um
plateau is distinct from that of the PAH bands.

erupting from the Sun on 9 April 2008. This prominence was tracked by both the
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) EUVI and COR1 telescopes, and
was seen to rotate about the line of sight as it erupted; therefore, the event
has been nicknamed the ""Cartwheel CME."" The threads of the prominence in the
core of the CME quite clearly indicate the structure of a weakly to moderately
twisted flux rope throughout the field of view, up to heliocentric heights of 4
solar radii. Although the STEREO separation was 48 degrees, it was possible to
match some sharp features in the later part of the eruption as seen in the 304
{\AA} line in EUVI and in the H\alpha-sensitive bandpass of COR1 by both STEREO
Ahead and Behind. These features could then be traced out in three-dimensional
space, and reprojected into a view in which the eruption is directed towards
the observer. The reconstructed view shows that the alignment of the prominence
to the vertical axis rotates as it rises up to a leading-edge height of \approx
2.5 solar radii, and then remains approximately constant. The alignment at 2.5
solar radii differs by about 115 degrees from the original filament orientation
inferred from H{\alpha} and EUV data, and the height profile of the rotation,
obtained here for the first time, shows that two thirds of the total rotation
is reached within \approx 0.5 solar radii above the photosphere. These features
are well reproduced by numerical simulations of an unstable moderately twisted
flux rope embedded in external flux with a relatively strong shear field
component.

parametric simulation study of unstable, rotating flux ropes in bipolar
force-free initial equilibrium. The Lorentz force due to the external shear
field component and the relaxation of tension in the twisted field are the
major contributors to the rotation in this model, while reconnection with the
ambient field is of minor importance. Both major mechanisms writhe the flux
rope axis, converting part of the initial twist helicity, and produce rotation
profiles which, to a large part, are very similar in a range of shear-twist
combinations. A difference lies in the tendency of twist-driven rotation to
saturate at lower heights than shear-driven rotation. For parameters
characteristic of the source regions of erupting filaments and coronal mass
ejections, the shear field is found to be the dominant origin of rotations in
the corona and to be required if the rotation reaches angles of order 90
degrees and higher; it dominates even if the twist exceeds the threshold of the
helical kink instability. The contributions by shear and twist to the total
rotation can be disentangled in the analysis of observations if the rotation
and rise profiles are simultaneously compared with model calculations. The
resulting twist estimate allows one to judge whether the helical kink
instability occurred. This is demonstrated for the erupting prominence in the
""Cartwheel CME"" on 9 April 2008, which has shown a rotation of \approx 115
degrees up to a height of 1.5 R_sun above the photosphere. Out of a range of
initial equilibria which include strongly kink-unstable (twist Phi=5pi), weakly
kink-unstable (Phi=3.5pi), and kink-stable (Phi=2.5pi) configurations, only the
evolution of the weakly kink-unstable flux rope matches the observations in

through an aperture on an otherwise black screen can be solved approximately by
Kirchhoff's integral over the aperture. Rubinowicz, on the other hand, was able
to split the solution into two parts: one is the geometrical part that appears
only in the geometrical illuminated region, and the other representing the
reflected wave is a line-integral along the edge of the aperture. However, this
decomposition is not entirely satisfactory in the sense that the two separated
fields are discontinuous at the boundary of the illuminated region. Also, the
functional form of the line-integral is not what one would expect an ordinary
reflection wave should be due to some confusing factors in the integrand.
Finally, the boundary conditions on the screen imposed by Kirchhoff's
approximation are mathematically inconsistent, and therefore, rigorously, this
decomposition formulation must be slightly modified by taking into account the
correct B.C.s. In this thesis, we use the consistent boundary conditions to
derive a slightly different decomposition formula which shows that the behavior
of the diffracted wave at the edge is exactly just like an ordinary
reflection-realizing the conjecture of Thomas Young in the 18th century. We
also derived another decomposition formula which avoids mathematical
discontinuity encountered by Rubinowicz. In the last section we demonstrate
that our solution is consistent with that obtained by Sommerfeld in the
rigorous 2-D plane-wave diffraction problem, so our formulation in this sense
may describe more accurately the behavior of diffracted wave near the edge of
the aperture than Kirchhoff's formula.

Hilbert spaces. We consider a scenario in which the protocols and cloners are
equipped with symmetries. These symmetries are used to define a quantum cloning
scenario. We find that, in general, it does not hold that the optimal attack is
an optimal cloner. However, there are classes of protocols, where we can
identify an optimal attack by an optimal cloner. We analyze protocols with 2, d
and d+1 mutually unbiased bases where d is a prime, and show that for the
protocols with 2 and d+1 MUBs the optimal attack is an optimal cloner, but for
the protocols with d MUBs, it is not. Finally, we give criteria to identify
protocols which have different signal states, but the same optimal attack.
Using these criteria, we present qubit protocols which have the same optimal
attack as the BB84 protocol or the 6-state protocol.

(12 Myr). It harbors an optically thin belt of circumstellar material at 90 AU.
We aim to study the dust properties in the belt in details, and to constrain
the gas-to-dust ratio. We obtained far-IR observations with the Herschel/PACS
instrument, and 3.2 mm observations with the ATCA array. The geometry of the
belt is constrained with newly reduced HST/NICMOS images that break the
degeneracy between the disk geometry and the dust properties. We use the
radiative transfer code GRaTer to compute a large grid of models, and we
identify the grain models that best reproduce the Spectral Energy Distribution
through a Bayesian analysis. We attempt to detect the [OI] and [CII] lines with
PACS spectroscopy, providing observables to our photochemical code ProDiMo. The
HST observations confirm that the dust is confined in a narrow belt. The
continuum is detected in the far-IR with PACS and the disk is resolved with
both PACS and ATCA. A medium integration of the gas spectral lines only
provides upper limits on the line fluxes. We show that the HD 181327 dust disk
consists of micron-sized grains of porous amorphous silicates and carbonaceous
material surrounded by an important layer of ice, for a total dust mass of 0.05
M\oplus (up to 1 mm). We discuss evidences that the grains are fluffy
aggregates. The upper limits on the gas lines do not provide unambiguous
constraints: only if the PAH abundance is high, the gas mass must be lower than
17 M\oplus. Despite the weak constraints on the gas disk, the age of HD 181327
and the properties of the dust disk suggest that it has passed the stage of
gaseous planets formation. The dust reveals a population of icy planetesimals,
similar to the primitive Kuiper Belt, that may be a source for the future

of an EPRB thought experiment whose output is filtered. The filter implements
the assumptions made by most investigators: that EPRB experiments satisfy a
fair sampling assumption; and that detections and coincidences occur randomly
with Poisson distributions (this provides a basis for calculating standard
errors of coincidence counts, correlations, and so forth). The model does not
fit the data-predicted and observed counts of detections and coincidences
differ far too much, by a chi-square criterion. Logically, one must give up
fair sampling and/or Poisson errors and/or the assumption that the data derive
ultimately from an EPRB thought experiment. In the literature, giving up fair
sampling seems to be coupled to giving up EPRB, but to me it seems just as
sensible to keep EPRB and to give up fair sampling and Poisson errors. Some
rather ordinary mechanisms can violate fair sampling, and there is the
possibility in any experiment for uncontrolled and unmonitored factors to
contribute to unwanted variation. By sufficiently relaxing the fair sampling
and Poisson assumptions-it doesn't take much-my model can be made to fit the

Our detection of phase slips in quantum interference experiments demonstrates a
powerful, new way of detecting braiding of anyons. We confirm the Abelian
anyonic braiding statistics in the $\nu = 7/3$ FQH state through detection of
the predicted statistical phase angle of $2\pi/3$, consistent with a change of
the anyonic particle number by one. The $\nu = 5/2$ FQH state is theoretically
believed to harbor non-Abelian anyons which are Majorana, meaning that each
pair of quasiparticles contain a neutral fermion orbital which can be occupied
or unoccupied and hence can act as a qubit. In this case our observed
statistical phase slips agree with a theoretical model where the Majoranas are
strongly coupled to each other, and strongly coupled to the edge modes of the
interferometer. In particular, an observed phase slip of approximately $\pi$ is
interpreted as a sudden flip of a qubit, or entry of a neutral fermion into the
interferometer. Our results provide compelling support for the existence of
non-Abelian anyons.

conformal field theories (LCFT) in the bulk. Building on earlier work in the
boundary case, our general strategy consists in analyzing the algebraic
properties of lattice regularizations (quantum spin chains) of these theories.
In the boundary case, a crucial step was the identification of the space of
states as a bimodule over the Temperley Lieb (TL) algebra and the quantum group
U_q sl(2). The extension of this analysis in the bulk case involves
considerable difficulties, since the U_q sl(2) symmetry is partly lost, while
the TL algebra is replaced by a much richer version (the Jones Temperley Lieb -
JTL - algebra). Even the simplest case of the gl(1|1) spin chain -
corresponding to the c=-2 symplectic fermions theory in the continuum limit -
presents very rich aspects, which we will discuss in several papers.
  In this first work, we focus on the symmetries of the spin chain, that is,
the centralizer of the JTL algebra in the alternating tensor product of the
gl(1|1) fundamental representation and its dual. We prove that this centralizer
is only a subalgebra of U_q sl(2) at q=i that we dub U_q^{odd} sl(2). We then
begin the analysis of the continuum limit of the JTL algebra: using general
arguments about the regularization of the stress energy-tensor, we identify
families of JTL elements going over to the Virasoro generators L_n, \bar{L}_n
in the continuum limit. We then discuss the SU(2) symmetry of the (continuum
limit) symplectic fermions theory from the lattice and JTL point of view.
  The analysis of the spin chain as a bimodule over U_q^{odd} sl(2) and JTL is
discussed in the second paper of this series.

of the alternating product of the gl(1|1) fundamental representation and its
dual. The local energy densities - the nearest neighbor Heisenberg-like
couplings - provide a representation of the Jones Temperley Lieb (JTL) algebra.
The symmetry algebra is then the centralizer of JTL, and turns out to be
smaller than for the open chain, since it is now only a subalgebra of U_q sl(2)
at q=i, dubbed U_q^{odd} sl(2). A crucial step in our associative algebraic
approach to bulk logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT) is then the analysis
of the spin chain as a bimodule over U_q^{odd} sl(2) and JTL. While our
ultimate goal is to use this bimodule to deduce properties of the LCFT in the
continuum limit, its derivation is sufficiently involved to be the sole subject
of this paper. We describe representation theory of the centralizer and then
use it to find a decomposition of the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain over JTL for
any even number N of tensorands and ultimately a corresponding bimodule
structure. Applications of our results to the analysis of the bulk LCFT will
then be discussed in the third part of this series.

confinement along the z direction is considered. It is shown that there exists
a finite Bose- Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature Tc that
decreases monotonically from the 3D ideal boson gas (IBG) value $T_{0}$ as the
strength of confinement $P_{0}$ is increased while keeping the channel's cross
section, $a_{x}a_{y}$ constant. In contrast, Tc is a non-monotonic function of
the cross-section area for fixed $P_{0}$. In addition to the BEC cusp, the
specific heat exhibits a set of maxima and minima. The minimum located at the
highest temperature is a clear signal of the confinement effect which occurs
when the boson wavelength is twice the cross-section side size. This
confinement is amplified when the wall strength is increased until a
dimensional crossover from 3D to 1D is produced. Some of these features in the

which was carried out under the assumption of full visibility, here we assume a
(simplified) communication model where unreliable wireless links are
represented as on/off channels. We present conditions on how to scale the model
parameters so that the network i) has no secure node which is isolated and ii)
is securely connected, both with high probability when the number of sensor
nodes becomes large. The results are given in the form of full zero-one laws,
and constitute the first complete analysis of the EG scheme under non-full
visibility. Through simulations these zero-one laws are shown to be valid also
under a more realistic communication model, i.e., the disk model. The relations
to the Gupta and Kumar's conjecture on the connectivity of geometric random
graphs with randomly deleted edges are also discussed.

PFM studies demonstrated that poling reduced the size of stripe-like domains
that were internal to the macro-domain plates, whose size also increased on
heating to TR-T. The temperature dependence of both the size of the
macro-domain plates and internal sub-domains followed the Arrhenius relation
with the activation energy of 0.4-0.5eV. The coercive field displays an
abnormal increase on heating below TR-T, different than that for PMN-PT. The
anomalously increased coercive field can be ascribed to the Arrhenius-type

spin-polarized tunneling, is described. The fundamental origin is the spin
dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of a tunnel junction with at least one
ferromagnetic electrode. Seebeck spin tunneling creates a thermal flow of
spin-angular momentum across a tunnel barrier without a charge tunnel current.
In ferromagnet/insulator/semiconductor tunnel junctions this can be used to
induce a spin accumulation (\Delta \mu) in the semiconductor in response to a
temperature difference (\Delta T) between the electrodes. A phenomenological
framework is presented to describe the thermal spin transport in terms of
parameters that can be obtained from experiment or theory. Key ingredients are
a spin-polarized thermoelectric tunnel conductance and a tunnel spin
polarization with non-zero energy derivative, resulting in different Seebeck
tunnel coefficients for majority and minority spin electrons. We evaluate the
thermal spin current, the induced spin accumulation and \Delta\mu/\Delta T,
discuss limiting regimes, and compare thermal and electrical flow of spin
across a tunnel barrier. A salient feature is that the thermally-induced spin
accumulation is maximal for smaller tunnel resistance, in contrast to the
electrically-induced spin accumulation that suffers from the impedance mismatch
between a ferromagnetic metal and a semiconductor. The thermally-induced spin
accumulation produces an additional thermovoltage proportional to \Delta\mu,
which can significantly enhance the conventional charge thermopower. Owing to
the Hanle effect, the thermopower can also be manipulated with a magnetic
field, producing a Hanle magnetothermopower.

belt. The family consists of Haumea and at least ten other ~100km-sized
trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) located in the region a = 42 - 44.5 AU. In this
work, we model the long-term orbital evolution of an ensemble of fragments
representing hypothetical post-collision distributions at the time of the
family's birth. We consider three distinct scenarios, in which the kinetic
energy of dispersed particles were varied such that their mean ejection
velocities (veje) were of order 200 m/s, 300 m/s and 400 m/s, respectively.
Each simulation considered resulted in collisional families that reproduced
that currently observed. The results suggest that 60-75% of the fragments
created in the collision will remain in the trans-Neptunian belt, even after 4
Gyr of dynamical evolution. The surviving particles were typically concentrated
in wide regions of orbital element space centred on the initial impact
location, with their orbits spread across a region spanning {\Delta}a ~ 6-12
AU, {\Delta}e ~ 0.1-0.15 and {\Delta}i ~ 7-10{\deg}. Most of the survivors
populated the so-called Classical and Detached regions of the trans-Neptunian
belt, whilst a minor fraction entered the Scattered Disk reservoir (<1%), or
were captured in Neptunian mean motion resonances (<10%). In addition, except
for those fragments located near strong resonances, the great majority
displayed negligible long-term orbital variation. This implies that the orbital
distribution of the intrinsic Haumean family can be used to constrain the
orbital conditions and physical nature of the collision that created the
family, billions of years ago. Indeed, our results suggest that the formation
of the Haumean collisional family most likely occurred after the bulk of
Neptune's migration was complete, or even some time after the migration had
completely ceased.

of ram pressure on cold gas clouds and radiation pressure on dust grains.
Taking into account the gravity due to disk, bulge and dark matter halo, and
assuming continuous star formation in the disk, we show that radiation or ram
pressure alone is not sufficient to drive escaping winds from disk galaxies,
and that both processes contribute. We show that in the parameter space of star
formation rate (SFR) and rotation speed of galaxies, the wind speed in galaxies
with rotation speed $v_c\le 200$ km s$^{-1}$ and SFR $\le 100$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, has a larger contribution from ram pressure, and that in high mass
galaxies with large SFR, radiation from the disk has a greater role in driving
galactic winds. The ratio of wind speed to circular speed can be approximated
as ${v_w \over v_c} \sim 10^{0.7} \, [{\rm SFR\over 50 \, {\rm M}_{\odot} \,
{\rm yr}^{-1}}] ^{0.4} \ [{v_c\over 120\, km/s}]^ {-1.25}$. We show that this
conclusion is borne out by observations of galactic winds at low and high
redshift and also of circumgalactic gas. We also estimate the mass loading
factors under the combined effect of ram and radiation pressure, and show that
the ratio of mass loss rate to SFR scales roughly as $v_c^{-1} \Sigma_g^{-1}$,

(Blasone-Vitiello formalism) has been shown to imply a highly non-trivial
vacuum state. In a previous work, we implemented the approach on a simple
supersymmetric model (free Wess-Zumino), with flavour mixing, which was
regarded as a model for free neutrinos and sneutrinos. The resulting effective
vacuum (called ""flavour vacuum"") was found to be characterized by a strong SUSY
breaking. In this paper we explore the phenomenology of the model and we argue
that the flavour vacuum is a consistent source for both Dark Energy (thanks to
the bosonic sector of the model) and Dark Matter (via the fermionic one). Quite
remarkably, besides the parameters connected with neutrino physics, in this
model no other parameters have been introduced, possibly leading to a
predictive theory of Dark Energy/Matter. Despite its oversimplification, such a
toy model already seems capable to shed some light on the observed energy
hierarchy between neutrino physics, Dark Energy and Dark Matter. Furthermore,
we move a step forth in the construction of a more realistic theory, by
presenting a novel approach for calculating relevant quantities and hence
extending some results to interactive theories, in a completely
non-perturbative way.

regime consistent with temperatures $10^7$--$10^8$ K. Similar features have
been also observed in the two Type Ic SNe SN 2002ap and SN 1994I that are not
associated to GRBs. We advance the possibility that the late X-ray emission
observed in GRB-SN and in isolated SN is associated to a hot neutron star (NS)
just formed in the SN event, here defined as a neo-NS. We discuss the thermal
evolution of neo-NS in the age regime that spans from $\sim 1$ minute (just
after the proto-NS phase) up to ages <10-100 yr. We examine the key factor
governing the neo-NS cooling emphasizing on the neutrino emission. A
phenomenological heating source and new boundary conditions are introduced to
mimic the high-temperature atmosphere of young NSs. We match the neo-NS
luminosity to the late X-ray emission of the GRB-SN events URCA-1 in
GRB980425-SN1998bw, URCA-2 in GRB030329-SN2003dh, and URCA-3 in
GRB031203-SN2003lw. By calibrating our additional heating source at early times
to $\sim 10^{12}$--$10^{15}$ erg/g/s, we find a striking agreement of the
luminosity obtained from the cooling of neo-NSs with the late
($t=10^{8}$--$10^{9}$ s) X-ray emission observed in GRB-SN. It is therefore
appropriate to revise the boundary conditions used in the cooling theory of
NSs, to match the proper conditions of the atmosphere at young ages. Additional
heating processes that are still not studied within this context, such as e+e-
pair creation by overcritical fields and nuclear fusion and fission energy
release, might also take place under such conditions and deserve further
analysis. Observation of GRB-SN has shown the possibility of witnessing the
thermal evolution of neo-NSs. A new campaign of dedicated observations is
recommended both of GRB-SN and of isolated Type Ic SN.

analysis for a concrete crystal can be performed analogously with the one in
the Landau theory of phase transitions. After the analysis one is able to
deduce a set of equations that describe the emerging phases and corresponding
phase transitions. The treatment of an incommensurate phase is substantially
complicated because the symmetry of the phase cannot be described in terms of
customary space groups. For this reason, a strategy of representing the
incommensurate phase as the limit of a sequence of long-period commensurate
phases whose period tends to infinity is worked out. The strategy enables one
to obviate difficulties due to the devil's staircase that occurs in this
situation.

coincides with the block-coding zero-error capacity of the channel. Maximin

complex interactions in natural systems. These models are aimed at replicating
specific statistical features encountered in real-world networks. However, it
is rarely considered to which degree the results obtained for one particular
network class can be extrapolated to real-world networks. We address this issue
by comparing different classical and more recently developed network models
with respect to their generalisation power, which we identify with large
structural variability and absence of constraints imposed by the construction
scheme. After having identified the most variable networks, we address the
issue of which constraints are common to all network classes and are thus
suitable candidates for being generic statistical laws of complex networks. In
fact, we find that generic, not model-related dependencies between different
network characteristics do exist. This allows, for instance, to infer global
features from local ones using regression models trained on networks with high
generalisation power. Our results confirm and extend previous findings
regarding the synchronisation properties of neural networks. Our method seems
especially relevant for large networks, which are difficult to map completely,
like the neural networks in the brain. The structure of such large networks
cannot be fully sampled with the present technology. Our approach provides a
method to estimate global properties of under-sampled networks with good
approximation. Finally, we demonstrate on three different data sets (C.
elegans' neuronal network, R. prowazekii's metabolic network, and a network of
synonyms extracted from Roget's Thesaurus) that real-world networks have

therefore represents an optimal discretization of the QCD Dirac operator with
respect to chiral symmetry. When computing propagators or in HMC simulations,
where one has to invert the overlap operator using some iterative solver, one
has to approxomate the action of the sign function of the (symmetrized) Wilson
fermion matrix Q on a vector b in each iteration. This is usually done
iteratively using a ""primary"" Lanczos iteration. In this process, it is very
important to have good stopping criteria which allow to reliably assess the
quality of the approximation to the action of the sign function computed so
far. In this work we show how to cheaply recover a secondary Lanczos process,
starting at an arbitrary Lanczos vector of the primary process and how to use
this secondary process to efficiently obtain computable error estimates and
error bounds for the Lanczos approximations to sign(Q)b, where the sign
function is approximated by the Zolotarev rational approximation.

droplets provide a vector for the spatial spread of infection with droplet
transport determined by diffusive and convective processes. An epidemiological
model describing the spatial dynamics of disease transmission is presented. The
effects of an ambient airflow, as an infection control, are incorporated
leading to a delay equation, with droplet density dependent on the infectious
density at a previous time. It is found that small droplets ($\sim 0.4\ \mu$m)
generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the
associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger
droplets ($\sim 4\ \mu$m) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a
fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localised
susceptible population. Droplet diffusion is found to be an inefficient mode of
droplet transport leading to minimal spatial spread of infection. A threshold
air velocity is derived, above which disease transmission is impaired even when

derived in terms of two dimensionless independent variables representing the

well-known result for a point absorber wave energy converter in the limit of
zero length and it gives Budal's upper bound in the limit of zero volume. The
equation shows that the maximum power absorbed by a heaving point absorber is
limited regardless of its volume, while for a heaving line absorber whose
length tends to infinity the maximum power is proportional to its swept volume,
with no limit. Power limits arise for line absorbers of practical lengths and
volumes but they can be multiples of those achieved for point absorbers of
similar volumes. This conclusion has profound implications for the scaling and
economics of wave energy converters.

estimate the influence of the model's parameters on the solution. Among
parameters the bottom topography, initial conditions, boundary conditions on
rigid boundaries, viscosity coefficients Coriolis parameter and the amplitude
of the wind stress tension are considered. Their influence is analyzed from
three points of view: 1. flexibility of the model with respect to a parameter
that is related to the lowest value of the cost function that can be obtained
in the data assimilation experiment that controls this parameter; 2.
possibility to improve the model by the parameter's control, i.e. whether the
solution with the optimal parameter remains close to observations after the end
of control; 3. sensitivity of the model solution to the parameter in a
classical sense. That implies the analysis of the sensitivity estimates and
their comparison with each other and with the local Lyapunov exponents that
characterize the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions. Two
configurations have been analyzed: an academic case of the model in a square
box and a more realistic case simulating Black Sea currents. It is shown in
both experiments that the boundary conditions near a rigid boundary influence

exhibit small velocities compared to the sound speed. To overcome the stringent
timestep restrictions posed by the predominantly used explicit methods for
integration in time the Euler (or Navier-Stokes) equations are usually replaced
by modified versions. In astrophysics this is nearly exclusively the anelastic
approximation. Kwatra et al. have proposed a method with favourable time-step
properties integrating the original equations (and thus allowing, for example,
also the treatment of shocks). We describe the extension of the method to the
Navier-Stokes and two-component equations. - However, when applying the
extended method to problems in convection and double diffusive convection
(semiconvection) we ran into numerical difficulties. We describe our procedure
for stabilizing the method. We also investigate the behaviour of Kwatra et
al.'s method for very low Mach numbers (down to Ma = 0.001) and point out its
very favourable properties in this realm for situations where the explicit
counterpart of this method returns absolutely unusable results. Furthermore, we
show that the method strongly scales over 3 orders of magnitude of processor
cores and is limited only by the specific network structure of the high

property of A-nets is planarity of vertex stars, so for generic A-nets the
elementary quadrilaterals are skew. We classify the simply connected affine
A-nets that can be extended to continuously differentiable surfaces by gluing
hyperboloid surface patches into the skew quadrilaterals. The resulting
surfaces are called ""hyperbolic nets"" and are a novel piecewise smooth
discretization of surfaces parametrized along asymptotic lines. It turns out
that a simply connected affine A-net has to satisfy one combinatorial and one
geometric condition to be extendable - all vertices have to be of even degree
and all quadrilateral strips have to be ""equi-twisted"". Furthermore, if an
A-net can be extended to a hyperbolic net, then there exists a 1-parameter
family of such C^1-surfaces. It is briefly explained how the generation of

10$\deg$ to 60$\deg$. Testing undirectly orbital self-consistency, we search
for the main periodic orbits and studied the density response. For pitch angles
up to approximately $\sim 20\deg$, the response supports closely the potential
permitting readily the presence of long lasting spiral structures. The density
response tends to ""avoid"" larger pitch angles in the potential, by keeping
smaller pitch angles in the corresponding response. Spiral arms with pitch
angles larger than $\sim 20\deg$, would not be long-lasting structures but
rather transient. On the other hand, from an extensive orbital study in phase
space, we also find that for late type galaxies with pitch angles larger than
$\sim 50\deg$, chaos becomes pervasive destroying the ordered phase space
surrounding the main stable periodic and quasi-periodic orbits and even
destroying them. This result is in good agreement with observations of late
type galaxies, where the maximum observed pitch angle is $\sim 50\deg$.

We consider generation of THz radiation from the spent electron beam downstream
of the SASE2 undulator in the electron beam dump area. In this way, the THz
output must propagate at least for 250 meters through the photon beam tunnel to
the experimental hall to reach the SASE2 X-ray hutches. We propose to use an
open beam waveguide such as an iris guide as transmission line. In order to
efficiently couple radiation into the iris transmission line, generation of the
THz radiation pulse can be performed directly within the iris guide. The line
transporting the THz radiation to the SASE2 X-ray hutches introduces a path
delay of about 20 m. Since THz pump/X-ray probe experiments should be enabled,
we propose to exploit the European XFEL baseline multi-bunch mode of operation,
with 222 ns electron bunch separation, in order to cope with the delay between
THz and X-ray pulses. We present start-to-end simulations for 1 nC bunch
operation-parameters, optimized for THz pump/X-ray probe experiments. Detailed
characterization of the THz and SASE X-ray radiation pulses is performed.
Highly focused THz beams will approach the high field limit of 1 V/atomic size.

spectroscopic data analysis, charge exchange and ionisation cross sections for

Euler-type equation: the fluid acts on the dispersed phase through a gyroscopic
force whereas the latter contributes to the vorticity of the former.
  First we give a Dobrushin type derivation of the system as a mean-field limit
of a PDE system which describes the dynamics of a finite number of massive
pointwise particles moving into an incompressible perfect fluid.
  This last system is itself inferred from a joint work of the second author
with O. Glass and C. Lacave, where the system for one massive pointwise
particle was derived as the limit of the motion of a solid body when the body
shrinks to a point with fixed mass and circulation.
  Then we deal with the well-posedness issues including the existence of weak
solutions. Next we exhibit the Hamiltonian structure of the system and finally,
we study the behavior of the system in the limit where the mass of the
particles vanishes.

flexibility that the number of entanglements is up to about 14 per chain, which
is comparable to experimental systems examined in the literature. The smallest
concentration at which linear contaminants increase the zero-shear viscosity of

the artificial viscosity of SPH. Second, we implement radiative cooling and
heating due to X-rays, and examine the impact of thermal feedback by the
central X-ray source. The accretion flow roughly follows the Bondi solution for
low central X-ray luminosities, however, the flow starts to exhibit
non-spherical fragmentation due to thermal instability for a certain range of
central L_X, and a strong overall outflow develops for greater L_X. The cold
gas develops filamentary structures that fall into the central SMBH, whereas
the hot gas tries to escape through the channels in-between the cold filaments.

band gap and conducting edge or surface states, where charge carriers are
protected against backscattering. These states give rise to the quantum spin
Hall effect without an external magnetic field, where electrons with opposite
spins have opposite momentum at a given edge. The surface energy spectrum of a
threedimensional topological insulator is made up by an odd number of Dirac
cones with the spin locked to the momentum. The long-sought yet elusive
Majorana fermion is predicted to arise from a combination of a superconductor
and a topological insulator. An essential step in the hunt for this emergent
particle is the unequivocal observation of supercurrent in a topological phase.
Here, we present the first measurement of a Josephson supercurrent through a
topological insulator. Direct evidence for Josephson supercurrents in
superconductor (Nb) - topological insulator (Bi2Te3) - superconductor e-beam
fabricated junctions is provided by the observation of clear Shapiro steps
under microwave irradiation, and a Fraunhofer-type dependence of the critical
current on magnetic field. The dependence of the critical current on
temperature and length shows that the junctions are in the ballistic limit.
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in magnetic fields up to 30 T reveal a
topologically non-trivial two-dimensional surface state. We argue that the
ballistic Josephson current is hosted by this surface state despite the fact
that the normal state transport is dominated by diffusive bulk conductivity.
The lateral Nb-Bi2Te3-Nb junctions hence provide prospects for the realization
of devices supporting Majorana fermions.

time, i.e. $P=\exp Qt$ it is easy to simulate this evolutionary process for a
given branch length (this amounts to requiring $Q$ of a certain trace). For the
more general case (what we call discrete-time models), it is not trivial to
generate a substitution matrix $P$ of given determinant (i.e. corresponding to
a process of given branch length). In this paper we solve this problem for the
most well-known discrete-time models JC*, K80*, K81*, SSM and GMM. These models
lie in the class of nonhomogeneous evolutionary models. For any of these models

modes strongly constrain the top-Higgs state predicted in many models with new
dynamics that preferentially affects top quarks. Such a state couples strongly
to top-quarks, and is therefore produced through gluon fusion at a rate that
can be greatly enhanced relative to the rate for the standard model Higgs
boson. As we discuss in this talk, a top-Higgs state with mass less than 300
GeV is excluded at 95% CL if the associated top-pion has a mass of 150 GeV, and
the constraint is even stronger if the mass of the top-pion state exceeds the
top-quark mass or if the top-pion decay constant is a substantial fraction of
the weak scale. These results have significant implications for theories with
strong top dynamics, such as topcolor-assisted technicolor, top-seesaw models,
and certain Higgsless models.

associated to the boundary of a sutured manifold and a filtration of its

$s$ over the manifold $X'$, which is obtained from $X$ by filling out the
sutures, the Ozsvath-Szabo chain complex $CF(X,\tau,s)$ is then defined as a
chain complex with coefficients in $A_\tau$ and filtered by $\SpinC(X,\tau)$.
The filtered chain homotopy type of this chain complex is an invariant of
$(X,\tau)$ and the Spin^c class $s\in\SpinC(X')$. The construction generalizes
the construction of Juhasz. It plays the role of $CF^-(X,s)$ when $X$ is a
closed three-manifold, and the role of $CFK^-(Y,K;s)$ when the sutured manifold
is obtained from a knot $K$ inside a three-manifold $Y$. Our invariants
generalize both the knot invariants of Ozsvath-Szabo and Rasmussen and the link

studying the kinematic properties of open clusters and young associations whose
members share the same spatial motion.
  Aims: We present a new CP search strategy based on proper motion data. We
test the new algorithm on synthetic data and compare it with previous versions
of the CP search method. As an illustration and validation of the new method we
also present an application to the Hyades open cluster and a comparison with
independent results.
  Methods: The new algorithm rests on the idea of representing the stellar
proper motions by great circles over the celestial sphere and visualizing their
intersections as the CP of the moving group. The new strategy combines a
maximum-likelihood analysis for simultaneously determining the CP and selecting
the most likely group members and a minimization procedure that returns a
refined CP position and its uncertainties. The method allows one to correct for
internal motions within the group and takes into account that the stars in the
group lie at different distances.
  Results: Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the new CP search
method in many cases returns a more precise solution than its previous
versions. The new method is able to find and eliminate more field stars in the
sample and is not biased towards distant stars. The CP solution for the Hyades
open cluster is in excellent agreement with previous determinations.

characterized. It is also unknown whether the initial conditions vary with
environment. Aims: We want to investigate the youngest massive gas clumps in
the environment of extremely active star formation. Methods: We selected the
IRDC18454 complex associated with the W43 Galactic mini-starburst, and observed
it in the continuum emission between 70mu and 1.2mm, and in spectral line
emission of N2H+ and 13CO with single-dish instruments and an interferometer.
Results: The multi-wavelength continuum study allows us to identify clumps that
are infrared dark even at 70mu and hence the best candidates to be genuine
high-mass starless gas clumps. The spectral energy distributions reveal
elevated temperatures and luminosities compared to more quiescent environments.
Furthermore, we identify a temperature gradient from the W43 mini-starburst
toward the starless clumps. We discuss whether the radiation impact of the
nearby mini-starburst changes the fragmentation properties of the gas clumps
and by that maybe favors more high-mass star formation in such an environment.
The spectral line data reveal two different velocity components of the gas at
100 and 50km/s. While chance projection is a possibility to explain these
components, the projected associations of the emission sources as well as the
prominent location at the Galactic bar -- spiral arm interface also allow the
possibility that these two components may be spatially associated and even
interacting. Conclusions: High-mass starless gas clumps can exist in the close
environment of very active star formation without being destroyed. The impact
of the active star formation sites may even allow for more high-mass stars to
form in these 2nd generation gas clumps.

duration are all performed in the far field. All pulse duration measurements
tacitly assume that both the beam's wavefront and intensity profile are
independent of frequency. However, if one or both are frequency dependent, then
the retrieved pulse duration depends on the location where the measurement is
made. We measure that each harmonic is very close to a Gaussian, but we also
find that both the intensity profile and the beam wavefront depend
significantly on the harmonic order.
  Thus, our findings mean that the pulse duration will depend on where the
pulse is observed. Measurement of spectrally resolved wavefronts along with
temporal characterization at one single point in the beam would enable complete

shows, by examples, how modeling all these features using Bayesian methods. In
short, one just need to formalize, using maths, the logical link between the
involved quantities, how the data arise and what we already known on the
quantities we want to study. The posterior probability distribution summarizes
what we known on the studied quantities after the data, and we should not be
afraid about their actual numerical computation, because it is left to
(special) Monte Carlo programs such as JAGS. As examples, we show how to
predict the mass of a new object disposing of a calibrating sample, how to
constraint cosmological parameters from supernovae data and how to check if the
fitted data are in tension with the adopted fitting model. Examples are given
with their coding. These examples can be easily used as template for completely
