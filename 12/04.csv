heterogeneous cellular networks, which will have dense and overlapping coverage
areas, and experience high levels of interference. Fractional frequency reuse
(FFR) is an attractive interference management technique due to its low
complexity and overhead, and significant coverage improvement for
low-percentile (cell-edge) users. Instead of relying on system simulations
based on deterministic access point locations, this paper instead proposes an
analytical model for evaluating Strict FFR and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR)
deployments based on the spatial Poisson point process. Our results both
capture the non-uniformity of heterogeneous deployments and produce tractable
expressions which can be used for system design with Strict FFR and SFR. We
observe that the use of Strict FFR bands reserved for the users of each tier
with the lowest average SINR provides the highest gains in terms of coverage
and rate, while the use of SFR allows for more efficient use of shared spectrum
between the tiers, while still mitigating much of the interference.
Additionally, in the context of multi-tier networks with closed access in some
tiers, the proposed framework shows the impact of cross-tier interference on
closed access FFR, and informs the selection of key FFR parameters in open
access.

observations in each band obtained over a decade along Stripe 82 (S82), whereas
the remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. The observed
time lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasar
variability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-frame
wavelengths from 1000A to 6000A. We publicly release a user-friendly catalog of
quasars from the SDSS Data Release 7 that have been observed at least twice in

random walk (DRW) model defined by a characteristic time scale and an
asymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black hole
mass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in S82, we can
fully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-S82 quasars such
as the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. All available data
are consistent with the DRW model as a viable description of the optical
continuum variability of quasars on time scales of ~5-2000 days in the rest

The first (conventional) technique defines the junctions directly by ion

method makes use of the phase competition between the superconducting YBCO
(Y123) and the insulating Y2BaCuO5 (Y211) phase at the grain boundary interface
on MgO (110) substrates. The voltage noise properties of the two methods are
compared in this study. For all junctions (having a thickness of 100 nm and
widths of 250-500 nm) we see a significant amount of individual charge traps.
We have extracted an approximate value for the effective area of the charge
traps from the noise data. From the noise measurements we infer that the soft
patterned junctions with a grain boundary (GB) interface manifesting a large
c-axis tunneling component have a uniform barrier and a SIS like behavior. The
noise properties of soft patterned junctions having a GB interface dominated by
transport parallel to the ab-planes are in accordance with a resonant tunneling
barrier model. The conventionally patterned junctions, instead, have suppressed
superconducting transport channels with an area much less than the nominal
junction area. These findings are important for the implementation of nanosized
Josephson junctions in quantum circuits.

number of confirmed brown dwarfs and substellar objects below the deuterium
burning mass limit. The most massive star, sigma Ori Aa, just in the cluster
centre, is the \sim20Msol-mass O9.5V star that illuminates the Horsehead
Nebula, while the least massive object yet reported, S Ori 70, is only around 3
MJup. In the middle, there is a continuum of stars and substellar objects of
all types (including magnetically active B2Vp stars, Herbig-Haro objects, FU
Ori stars or T Tauri brown dwarfs) that makes the cluster a cornerstone in the
study of the initial mass function, disc presence, X-ray emission or accretion
at all mass domains. However, the derived masses strongly depend on the actual
heliocentric distance to the cluster. Gaia will solve the dilemma.

reduce greenhouse gas emissions and change the way vehicles obtain power. PEV
charging stations will most likely be available at home and at work, and
occasionally be publicly available, offering flexible charging options.
Ideally, each vehicle will charge during periods when electricity prices are
relatively low, to minimize the cost to the consumer and maximize societal
benefits. A Demand Response (DR) service for a fleet of PEVs could yield such
charging schedules by regulating consumer electricity use during certain time
periods, in order to meet an obligation to the market.
  We construct an automated DR mechanism for a fleet of PEVs that facilitates
vehicle charging to ensure the demands of the vehicles and the market are met.
Our dynamic algorithm depends only on the knowledge of a few hundred driving
behaviors from a previous similar day, and uses a simple adjusted pricing
scheme to instantly assign feasible and satisfactory charging schedules to
thousands of vehicles in a fleet as they plug-in. The charging schedules
generated using our adjusted pricing scheme can ensure that a new demand peak
is not created and can reduce the consumer cost by over 30% when compared to
standard charging, which may also increase peak demand by 3.5%. In this paper,
we present our formulation, algorithm and results.

literature although they possess more academic values besides the control study
here. Some existence and uniqueness result to ASDEs is presented. Third, to

can effectively solve the reconstruction problem for spatially coupled
measurements with undersampling rates close to the fraction of non-zero
coordinates.
  We use an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and analyze it through
the state evolution method. We give a rigorous proof that this approach is
successful as soon as the undersampling rate $\delta$ exceeds the (upper)
R\'enyi information dimension of the signal, $\uRenyi(p_X)$. More precisely,
for a sequence of signals of diverging dimension $n$ whose empirical
distribution converges to $p_X$, reconstruction is with high probability
successful from $\uRenyi(p_X)\, n+o(n)$ measurements taken according to a band
diagonal matrix.
  For sparse signals, i.e., sequences of dimension $n$ and $k(n)$ non-zero
entries, this implies reconstruction from $k(n)+o(n)$ measurements. For
`discrete' signals, i.e., signals whose coordinates take a fixed finite set of
values, this implies reconstruction from $o(n)$ measurements. The result is
robust with respect to noise, does not apply uniquely to random signals, but
requires the knowledge of the empirical distribution of the signal $p_X$.

We develop both a channel quantization scheme and allocation of limited
feedback bits to the various wireless links. We assume that the quantized CSI
is reported to a central node responsible for optimal resource allocation. We
first derive tight lower and upper bounds on the difference in rates between
the perfect CSI and quantized CSI scenarios. These bounds are then used to
derive an effective quantizer for arbitrary channel distributions. Next, we use
these bounds to optimize the allocation of bits across the links subject to a
budget on total available quantization bits. In particular, we show that the
optimal bit allocation algorithm allocates more bits to those links in the
network that contribute the most to the sum-rate. Finally, the paper
investigates the choice of the central node; we show that this choice plays a
significant role in CSI bits required to achieve a target performance level.

a basic assumption for all existing methods. However, this assumption is
questionable as it is hard to hold in most of cases and none of existing
methods may provide consistent estimation and accurate model prediction in
nons-parse scenarios. In this paper, we propose semiparametric re-modeling and
inference when the linear regression model under study is possibly non-sparse.
After an initial working model is selected by a method such as the Dantzig
selector adopted in this paper, we re-construct a globally unbiased
semiparametric model by use of suitable instrumental variables and
nonparametric adjustment. The newly defined model is identifiable, and the
estimator of parameter vector is asymptotically normal. The consistency,
together with the re-built model, promotes model prediction. This method
naturally works when the model is indeed sparse and thus is of robustness
against non-sparseness in certain sense. Simulation studies show that the new
approach has, particularly when $p$ is much larger than $n$, significant
improvement of estimation and prediction accuracies over the Gaussian Dantzig
selector and other classical methods. Even when the model under study is
sparse, our method is also comparable to the existing methods designed for
sparse models.

to the Central Sets Theorem. The algebraic techniques also discovered many

rescaling can adapt to different smoothness levels of a function valued
parameter in many nonparametric Bayesian analyses, offering a posterior
convergence rate that is optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for the smoothness
class the true function belongs to. This optimal rate also depends on the
dimension of the function's domain and one could potentially obtain a faster
rate of convergence by casting the analysis in a lower dimensional subspace
that does not amount to any loss of information about the true function. In
general such a subspace is not known a priori but can be explored by equipping
the model with variable selection or linear projection. We demonstrate that for
nonparametric regression, classification, density estimation and density
regression, a rescaled Gaussian process model equipped with variable selection

logarithmic factors) for the lowest dimension in which the analysis could be
cast without any loss of information about the true function. Theoretical
exploration of such dimension reduction features appears novel for Bayesian

at the nuclear surface in a general form. The theory explains the recently
extracted large symmetry energy by Natowitz et al. at low densities of nuclear
matter and is fully consistent with the static properties of nuclei. In
phenomenological way clusters of all sizes, shapes along with medium
modifications are included. Symmetric nuclear matter properties are discussed
in detail. Arguments are given that lead to an equation of state of nuclear
matter consistent with clustering in the low density region. We also discuss
properties of asymmetric nuclear matter. Because of clustering, an interesting
interpretation of the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter emerges.
As a framework, an extended version of Thomas Fermi theory is adopted for
nuclei which also contain phenomenological pairing and Wigner contributions.
This theory connects the nuclear matter equation of state, which incorporate
clustering at low densities, with clustering in nuclei at the nuclear surface.
Calculations are performed for various equation of state of nuclear matter. We
consider measured binding energies of 2149 nuclei for N, Z \geq 8. The
importance of quartic term in symmetry energy is demonstrated at and below the
saturation density of nuclear matter. It is shown that it is largely related to
the use of, ab initio, realistic equation of state of neutron matter,
particularly the contribution arising from the three neutron interaction and
somewhat to clustering. Reasons for these are discussed. Because of clustering
the neutron skin thickness in nuclei is found to reduce significantly. Theory
predicts new situations and regimes to be explored both theoretically and
experimentally.

establish that the origin of the crossover is the Peierls-Nabarro barrier, an

mean-field description the crossover becomes even sharper which is also
reflected by a sudden change of the coherence of the condensate. While we
expect that the crossover can be readily studied in current experiments in deep

place in such accretion flows as realized in the nuclei of the galaxies
believed to be accreting at a very small fraction of each Eddinton accretion
rate. Within the present status of this model, however, the model cannot
describe the launch of a self-confined bipolar jet from the vicinity of disk's
inner edge, although it allows the existence of a thermal wind widely
distributed over the disk surfaces. This is because the electric field (and
hence the Poynting flux) vanishes everywhere in the disk, whereas such a jet in
a globally ordered magnetic field is most likely to be accelerated
electrodynamically. We show in the present paper that this defect can be
overcome naturally if we reformulate the problem so as to admit a
quasi-stationary change of the magnetic field (and hence the appearance of a
non-irrotational electric field), and also restore all the terms of order
epsilon ~ (v_r/v_{varphi})^2 < 1 (where v_r and v_{varphi} denote radial and
azimuthal components, respectively, of the fluid velocity) which have been
neglected altogether in the previous treatments. The restored effects are the
inertial and magnetic draggings on the infalling matter. As an illustrative
example, a model solution which is correct up to the first order in epsilon is
derived under a set of plausible restrictions. The new solution predicts the
appearance of a localized Poynting flux in a region near the disk inner edge,
suggesting strongly that a jet is launched from this region. Another
interesting prediction is the appearance of a rapid change of the magnetic
field also localized to this region.

is upper bounded by the entropy of the measured subsystem. We establish a
relationship between the relative entropy of nonlocality and the geometric
nonlocality based on the Hilbert- Schmidt norm, and show that it is equal to
the maximal distillable entanglement. Several trade-off relations are obtained
for tripartite pure states. We also give explicit expressions for the relative

vector fields of degree one (i.e., linear systems) can be decided in polynomial
time e.g. by searching for a quadratic Lyapunov function. Since homogeneous
vector fields of even degree can never be AS, the next interesting degree to
consider is equal to three. In this paper, we prove that deciding AS of
homogeneous cubic vector fields is strongly NP-hard and pose the question of
determining whether it is even decidable. As a byproduct of the reduction that
establishes our NP-hardness result, we obtain a Lyapunov-inspired technique for
proving positivity of forms. We also show that for asymptotically stable
homogeneous cubic vector fields in as few as two variables, the minimum degree
of a polynomial Lyapunov function can be arbitrarily large. Finally, we show
that there is no monotonicity in the degree of polynomial Lyapunov functions
that prove AS; i.e., a homogeneous cubic vector field with no homogeneous
polynomial Lyapunov function of some degree $d$ can very well have a
homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function of degree less than $d$.

provide important information about the activity of their central engines and
their environments. In particular, the short timescale variability, such as
bumps and/or rebrightening features visible in the multi-wavelength light
curves, is still poorly understood.
  Aims. We analyze the multi-wavelength observations of the GRB100219A
afterglow at redshift 4.7. In particular, we attempt to identify the physical
origin of the late achromatic flares/bumps detected in the X-ray and optical
bands.
  Methods. We present ground-based optical photometric data and Swift X-ray
observations on GRB100219A. We analyzed the temporal behavior of the X-ray and
optical light curves, as well as the X-ray spectra.
  Results. The early flares in the X-ray and optical light curves peak
simultaneously at about 1000 s after the burst trigger, while late achromatic
bumps in the X-ray and optical bands appear at about 20000 s after the burst
trigger. These are uncommon features in the afterglow phenomenology.
Considering the temporal and spectral properties, we argue that both optical
and X-ray emissions come from the same mechanism. The late flares/bumps may be
produced by late internal shocks from long-lasting activity of the central
engine. An off-axis origin for a structured jet model is also discussed to
interpret the bump shapes. The early optical bump can be interpreted as the
afterglow onset, while the early X-ray flare could be caused by the internal
activity. GRB 100219A exploded in a dense environment as revealed by the strong
attenuation of X-ray emission and the optical-to-X-ray spectral energy
distribution.

has recently been proposed as an observational tool for mapping out the
large-scale structures in the post-reionization era z < 6. This has a
significant advantage as the problems of continuum subtraction and foreground
removal are expected to be considerably less severe in comparison to the
respective auto-correlation signals. Further, the effect of discrete quasar
sampling is less severe for the cross-correlation in comparison to the Ly-alpha
forest auto-correlation signal. In this paper we explore the possibility of
using the cross-correlation signal to detect the baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO). To this end, we have developed a theoretical formalism to calculate the
expected cross-correlation signal and its variance. We have used this to
predict the expected signal, and estimate the range of observational parameters
where a detection is possible.
  For the Ly-$\alpha$ forest, we have considered BOSS and BIGBOSS which are
expected have a quasar density of 16 deg^{-2} and 64 deg^{-2} respectively. A
radio interferometric array that covers the redshift range z=2 to 3 using
antennas of size 2 m * 2 m, is well suited for the 21-cm observations. It is
required to observe 25 independent fields of view, which corresponds to the
entire angular extent of BOSS. We find that it is necessary to achieve a noise
level of 1.1 * 10^{-5} K^2 and 6.25 * 10^{-6} mK^2 per field of view in the
21-cm observations to detect the angular and radial BAO respectively with BOSS.
The corresponding figures are 3.3 * 10^{-5} mK^2 and 1.7 * 10^{-5} mK^2 for
BIGBOSS. Four to five independent radio interferometric arrays, each containing
400 antennas uniformly sampling all the baselines within 50 m will be able to
carry out these observations in the span of a few years.

scale of 3C 84 using the archival VLBA 43-GHz data covering the period between
2002 January to 2008 November. We find that the new component ""C3"", previously
reported by the observations with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry
(VERA), was already formed in 2003. The flux density of C3 increases moderately
until 2008, and then it becomes brighter rapidly after 2008. The radio core,
C1, also shows a similar trend. The apparent speed of C3 with reference to the
core C1 shows moderate acceleration from 0.10c to 0.47c between 2003 November
to 2008 November, but is still sub-relativistic. We further try to fit the
observed broadband spectrum by the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
model using the measured apparent speed of C3. The fit can reproduce the
observed \gamma-ray emission, but does not agree with the observed radio
spectral index between 22 and 43 GHz.

useful for quickly gauging the scale of economic, technological, and
demographic changes required to reduce environmental impacts and pressures; in
the case of the Kaya identity, the environmental pressure is greenhouse gas
emissions. However, when considering large-scale economic transformation, as
with a shift to a low-carbon economy, the IPAT and Kaya identities and their
cousins fail to capture the legacy of existing capital, on the one hand, and
the need for new investment, on the other. While detailed models can capture
these factors, they do not allow for rapid exploration of widely different
alternatives, which is the appeal of the IPAT and Kaya identities. In this
paper we present an extended Kaya identity that includes investment and capital
stocks. The identity we propose is a sum of terms, rather than a simple scaling
relation. Nevertheless, it allows for quick analysis and rapid exploration of a
variety of different possible paths toward a low-carbon economy.

symplectic principal GL(1,R)-bundles. Gradings compatible with the
GL(1,R)-action lead to the concept of a graded contact manifold, in particular
a linear (more generally, n-linear) contact structure. Linear contact
structures are proven to be exactly the canonical contact structures on first
jets of line bundles. They provide linear Kirillov (or Jacobi) brackets and
give rise to the concept of a Kirillov algebroid, an analog of a Lie algebroid,
for which the corresponding cohomology operator is represented not by a vector
field (de Rham derivative) but a first-order differential operator. It is shown
that one can view Kirillov or Jacobi brackets as homological Hamiltonians on
linear contact manifolds. Contact manifolds of degree 2 are studied, as well as
contact analogs of Courant algebroids. We define lifting procedures that
provide us with constructions of canonical examples of the structures in
question.

into corrections of similar size in the respective branching ratios. These

We introduce a concept of `reduced spaces' to characterize local structures of
ground-state spaces. For a many-body system, we characterize mathematical
structures for the set $\Theta_k$ of all the $k$-particle reduced spaces, which
with a binary operation called join forms a semilattice that can be interpreted
as an abstract convex structure. The smallest nonzero elements in $\Theta_k$,
called atoms, are analogs of extreme points. We study the properties of atoms
in $\Theta_k$ and discuss its relationship with ground states of $k$-local
frustration-free Hamiltonians. For spin-1/2 systems, we show that all the atoms
in $\Theta_2$ are unique ground states of some 2-local frustration-free
Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that the elements in $\Theta_k$ may not be the
join of atoms, indicating a richer structure for $\Theta_k$ beyond the convex
structure. Our study of $\Theta_k$ deepens the understanding of ground-state
space properties for frustration-free Hamiltonians, from a new angle of reduced
spaces.

specific coupling which results in a component action containing only time
derivatives of fermionic components presented in the auxiliary supermultiplet,
which therefore may be dualized into auxiliary ones. The resulting component
action describes the interaction of the chiral supermultiplet with a magnetic
field constant on the pseudo-sphere $SU(1,1)/U(1)$. Then we specify the
prepotential of our theory to get, in the bosonic sector, the action for the
particle moving over the pseudo-sphere -- Lobachevsky space. We provided also
the Hamiltonian formulation of this system and show that the full symmetry
group of our system is $SU(1,1)\times U(1)$. The currents forming the $su(1,1)$
algebra are modified, as compared to the bosonic case, by the fermionic and
isospin terms, while the additional u(1) current contains only isospin
variables.
  One of the most important features of our construction is the presence in the
Hamiltonian and supercharges of all currents of the isospin group SU(2).
Despite the fact that two of the su(2) currents ${T,{\bar{T}}}$ enter the
Hamiltonian only through the Casimir operator of the SU(2) group, they cannot
be dropped out, even after fixing the total isospin of the system, because
these currents themselves enter into the supercharges.
  We also present the Hamiltonian and supercharges describing the motion of a
particle over the sphere $S^2$ in the background of constant magnetic field. In
this case the additional isospin currents form the $su(1,1)$ algebra.
