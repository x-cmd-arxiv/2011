for different preparations of the system. We examine the evolution of the
quantum purity, the localized correlation, and the probability to be in a

Although some progress has been made to develop a geostatistic of extremes,
conditional simulation of max-stable processes is still in its early stage.
This paper proposes a framework to get conditional simulations of Brown-Resnick
processes. Although closed forms for the regular conditional distribution of
Brown-Resnick processes were recently found, sampling from this conditional
distribution is a considerable challenge as it leads quickly to a combinatorial
explosion. To bypass this computational burden, a Markov chain Monte-Carlo
algorithm is presented. We test the method on simulated data and give an
application to extreme rainfall around Zurich. Results show that the proposed
framework provides accurate conditional simulations of Brown-Resnick processes
and can handle real-sized problems.

are focused on the analysis of foragers movements. Resource detection patterns
in space and time are not commonly studied, yet they are tightly coupled to
landscape properties and add relevant information on foraging behavior. By
exploring simple foraging models in unpredictable environments we show that the
distribution of intervals between detected prey (detection statistics)is mostly
determined by the spatial structure of the prey field and essentially distinct
from predator displacement statistics. Detections are expected to be Poissonian
in uniform random environments for markedly different foraging movements (e.g.
L\'evy and ballistic). This prediction is supported by data on the time
intervals between diving events on short-range foraging seabirds such as the
thick-billed murre ({\it Uria lomvia}). However, Poissonian detection
statistics is not observed in long-range seabirds such as the wandering
albatross ({\it Diomedea exulans}) due to the fractal nature of the prey field,
covering a wide range of spatial scales. For this scenario, models of fractal
prey fields induce non-Poissonian patterns of detection in good agreement with
two albatross data sets. We find that the specific shape of the distribution of
time intervals between prey detection is mainly driven by meso and
submeso-scale landscape structures and depends little on the forager strategy
or behavioral responses.

extending these methods to not necessarily bounded collections of previous
estimators. We consider then the problem of robust $M$-estimation. We propose a
slightly more complicated construction to handle this problem and, as examples
of applications, we apply our general approach to least-squares density
estimation, to density estimation with K\""ullback loss and to a non-Gaussian,
unbounded, random design and heteroscedastic regression problem. Finally, we
show that our strategy can be used when the data are only assumed to be mixing.

emission from NGC 1275, the central radio galaxy of the Perseus cluster of
galaxies. The source has been detected by the MAGIC telescopes with a
statistical significance of 6.6 sigma above 100 GeV in 46 hr of stereo
observations carried out between August 2010 and February 2011. The measured
differential energy spectrum between 70 GeV and 500 GeV can be described by a
power law with a steep spectral index of \Gamma=-4.1+/-0.7stat+/-0.3syst, and
the average flux above 100 GeV is F_{gamma}=(1.3+/-0.2stat+/-0.3syst) x 10^-11
cm^-2 s^-1. These results, combined with the power-law spectrum measured in the
first two years of observations by the Fermi-LAT above 100 MeV, with a spectral
index of Gamma ~ -2.1, strongly suggest the presence of a break or cut-off
around tens of GeV in the NGC 1275 spectrum. The light curve of the source
above 100 GeV does not show hints of variability on a month time scale.
Finally, we report on the nondetection in the present data of the radio galaxy
IC 310, previously discovered by the Fermi-LAT and MAGIC. The derived flux
upper limit F^{U.L.}_{gamma} (>300 GeV)=1.2 x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1 is a factor ~ 3
lower than the mean flux measured by MAGIC between October 2009 and February
2010, thus confirming the year time-scale variability of the source at VHE.

linking spatial regions (`holes') in a class of simple one-dimensional,
periodically lifted maps. The parameter dependent diffusion coefficient can be
obtained analytically via a Taylor-Green-Kubo formula in terms of a functional
recursion relation. We find that the diffusion coefficient varies
non-monotonically with the size of a hole and its position, which implies that
a diffusion coefficient can increase by making the hole smaller. We derive
analytic formulas for small holes in terms of periodic orbits covered by the
holes. The asymptotic regimes that we observe show deviations from the standard
stochastic random walk approximation. The escape rate of the corresponding open
system is also calculated. The resulting parameter dependencies are compared

accuracy are investigated in this paper, in the context of dusty plasmas. In
kinematic simulations, notable improvement in the target track accuracy was
found when including all nearest neighbors in the state estimation filter and
tracking algorithm, whereas the track accuracy was not significantly improved
by higher-accuracy measurement techniques. The state estimation algorithm,
involving an extended Kalman filter, was shown to either remove or
significantly reduce errors due to ""pixel locking"". It is concluded that the
significant extra complexity and computational expense to achieve these
relatively small improvements are likely to be unwarranted for many situations.
For the purposes of determining the precise particle locations, it is concluded
that the simplified state estimation algorithm can be a viable alternative to

numbers, namely: (i) the scaling for the growth rate of small-scale dynamo
instability in the vicinity of the dynamo threshold; (ii) the existence of the
Golitsyn spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in small-scale dynamos. There are
two different asymptotics for the small-scale dynamo growth rate: in the
vicinity of the threshold of the excitation of the small-scale dynamo
instability, $\lambda \propto \ln({\rm Rm}/ {\rm Rm}^{\rm cr})$, and when the
magnetic Reynolds number is much larger than the threshold of the excitation of
the small-scale dynamo instability, $\lambda \propto {\rm Rm}^{1/2}$, where
${\rm Rm}^{\rm cr}$ is the small-scale dynamo instability threshold in the
magnetic Reynolds number ${\rm Rm}$. We demonstrated that the existence of the
Golitsyn spectrum of magnetic fluctuations requires a finite correlation time
of the random velocity field. On the other hand, the influence of the Golitsyn
spectrum on the small-scale dynamo instability is minor. This is the reason why
it is so difficult to observe this spectrum in direct numerical simulations for
the small-scale dynamo with low magnetic Prandtl numbers.

black hole binaries in an inhomogeneous scalar field, specifically binaries
inside a scalar field bubble, in some cases with a potential. We calculate the
emission of dipole radiation. We also show how these configurations trigger
detectable differences between gravitational waves in scalar-tensor gravity and
the corresponding waves in general relativity. We conclude that, barring an
external mechanism to induce dynamics in the scalar field, scalar-tensor
gravity binary black holes alone are not capable of awaking a dormant scalar

in rotating neutron stars by nonlinear bulk viscosity in the so-called
supra-thermal regime. In this regime the dissipative action of bulk viscosity
is known to be enhanced as a result of nonlinear contributions with respect to
the oscillation amplitude. Our analysis of the f-mode instability is based on a
time-domain code that evolves linear perturbations of rapidly rotating
polytropic neutron star models. The extracted mode frequency and eigenfunctions
are subsequently used in standard energy integrals for the gravitational wave
growth and viscous damping. We find that nonlinear bulk viscosity has a
moderate impact on the size of the f-mode instability window, becoming an
important factor and saturating the mode's growth at a relatively large
oscillation amplitude. We show similarly that nonlinear bulk viscosity leads to
a rather high saturation amplitude even for the r-mode instability. In
addition, we show that the action of bulk viscosity can be significantly
mitigated by the presence of superfluidity in neutron star matter. Apart from
revising the f-mode's instability window we provide results on the mode's
gravitational wave detectability. Considering an f-mode-unstable neutron star
located in the Virgo cluster and assuming a mode amplitude at the level allowed
by bulk viscosity, we find that the emitted gravitational wave signal could be
detectable by advanced ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO/Virgo and
the Einstein Telescope.

rapid and permanent variation of the photospheric magnetic field in response to
the coronal magnetic field restructuring during the eruption. The Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager instrument (HMI) on board the newly launched Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) produces seeing-free full-disk vector magnetograms at
consistently high resolution and high cadence, which finally makes possible an
unambiguous and comprehensive study of this important back-reaction process. In
this study, we present a near disk-center, GOES -class X2.2 flare, which
occurred in NOAA AR 11158 on 2011 February 15. Using the magnetic field
measurements made by HMI, we obtained the first solid evidence of a rapid (in
about 30 minutes) and irreversible enhancement in the horizontal magnetic field
at the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) by a magnitude of ~30%.
It is also shown that the photospheric field becomes more sheared and more
inclined. This field evolution is unequivocally associated with the flare
occurrence in this sigmoidal active region, with the enhancement area located
in between the two chromospheric flare ribbons and the initial conjugate hard
X-ray footpoints. These results strongly corroborate our previous conjecture
that the photospheric magnetic field near the PIL must become more horizontal
after eruptions, which could be related to the newly formed low-lying fields
resulted from the tether-cutting reconnection.

other classes of unconventional superconductors, atypical transport is well
correlated with proximity to a quantum critical point, but the relative
importance of quantum criticality in the cuprates remains uncertain. Here we
identify quantum critical scaling in the electron-doped cuprate material
La2-xCexCuO4 with a line of quantum critical points that surrounds the
superconducting phase as a function of magnetic field and charge doping. This
zero-temperature phase boundary, which delineates a metallic Fermi liquid
regime from an extended non-Fermi liquid ground state, closely follows the
upper critical field of the overdoped superconducting phase and gives rise to
an expanse of distinct non Fermi liquid behavior at finite temperatures.

the other is a large shell-like pattern in the inner halo that implies a
massive, hitherto unrecognized accretion event. We perform extensive
statistical tests and independent metallicity analyses to verify the presence

methodologies for future extragalactic studies of phase-space substructure. The
cold outer stream is consistent with a dwarf galaxy accretion event, while for
the inner shell there is tension between a low progenitor mass implied by the
cold velocity dispersion, and a high mass from the large number of GCs, which
might be resolved by a ~0.5 L* E/S0 progenitor. We also carry out
proof-of-principle numerical simulations of the accretion of smaller galaxies
in an M87-like gravitational potential. These produce analogous features to the
observed substructures, which should have observable lifetimes of ~1 Gyr. The

challenges for the dark matter interpretation of mass discrepancies in

square-root of the cosmological constant in natural units. This relation can at
present most easily be interpreted as the effect of a single universal force
law resulting from a modification of Newtonian dynamics (MOND) on galactic
scales. We exhaustively review the current observational successes and problems
of this alternative paradigm at all astrophysical scales, and summarize the
various theoretical attempts (TeVeS, GEA, BIMOND, and others) made to
effectively embed this modification of Newtonian dynamics within a relativistic

doublet model spectrum, with the pseudo-scalar state being the lightest, could
be responsible for the diphoton signal events. In this model, the other scalars
are considerably heavier and are not excluded by the current LHC data. If this
assumption is correct, future LHC data should show a strengthening of the
$\gamma\gamma$ signal, while the signals in the $ZZ^{(*)}\to 4\ell $ and
$WW^{(*)}\to 2\ell 2\nu$ channels should diminish and eventually disappear, due
to the absence of diboson tree-level couplings of the CP-odd state. The heavier
CP-even neutral scalars can now decay into channels involving the CP-odd light
scalar which, together with their larger masses, allow them to avoid the
existing bounds on Higgs searches. We suggest additional signals to confirm
this scenario at the LHC, in the decay channels of the heavier scalars into
$AA$ and $AZ$. Finally, this inverted two-Higgs doublet spectrum is
characteristic in models where fermion condensation leads to electroweak
symmetry breaking. We show that in these theories it is possible to obtain the
observed diphoton signal at or somewhat above of the prediction for the
standard model Higgs for the typical values of the parameters predicted.

asymptotically flat spacetimes at spatial infinity in four spacetime dimensions
in a hopefully pedagogical way. As a first motivation of this work, it
highlights the difficulties one encounters when trying to understand the
gravitational duality, present at the linearized level, in the full non-linear
Einstein's theory or even just in an asymptotic regime of it. In the first
part, we restrict the discussion to the Noetherian surface charges, called
""electric charges"", and study the existence of a larger phase space, than
previously known in the literature, where the awkward parity boundary
conditions, firstly imposed by T. Regge and C. Teitelboim, are relaxed. In the
absence of these parity conditions, we show how the Einstein-Hilbert action is
a correct variational principle when it is supplemented by an anomalous
counter-term and construct conserved and finite charges associated to the
larger asymptotic symmetry group. The second and third parts focus on the
magnetic information obtained through gravitational duality. As this duality is
only known at the linearized level, asymptotic linearity is implicitly assumed
at spatial infinity. In the second part, gravitational duality for the
linearized gravity theory is reviewed and ten dual Poincar\'e charges, or
topological ""magnetic"" charges, are constructed \`a la Abbott-Deser. The last
part explains how the NUT charge N, gravitational dual of the mass M and
present in the BPS bound of the supersymmetric charged Taub-NUT black hole,
copes with the N=2 superalgebra. This is achieved through a complexification of
the Witten-Nester 2-form.

z=0.4068 that is rapidly forming stars at a rate of ~30 M_sun/yr, almost an
order of magnitude higher than any previously identified short GRB host. Using
photometry from Gemini, Keck, PAIRITEL, and WISE, we show that the galaxy is
very red (g-K = 4.3 AB mag), heavily obscured (A_V ~ 2 mag), and has the
highest metallicity of any GRB host to date (12 + log[O/H]_KD02 = 9.2): it is a
classical luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), with L_IR ~ 4 x 10^11 L_sun. While
these properties could be interpreted to support an association of this GRB
with very recent star formation, modeling of the broadband spectral energy
distribution also indicates that a substantial stellar mass of mostly older
stars is present. The current specific star-formation rate is modest (specific
SFR ~ 0.5 Gyr^-1), the current star-formation rate is not substantially
elevated above its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign of
recent merger activity. Our observations are therefore equally consistent with
an older progenitor, similar to what is inferred for other short-hard GRBs.
Given the precedent established by previous short GRB hosts and the significant
fraction of the Universe's stellar mass in LIRG-like systems at z >~0.3, an
older progenitor represents the most likely origin of this event.

observed XRT count rates to be predominantly lower than expected based on the
reported ASCA intensities. Investigation of the ASCA properties and long-term

determination of the underlying model. While this may be challenging or even
intractable, a more optimistic question is whether we can understand the main
contours of any particular paradigm of the mediation of supersymmetry breaking.
The determination of superpartner masses through endpoint measurements of
kinematic observables arising from cascade decays is a powerful diagnostic
tool. In particular, the determination of the gaugino sector has the potential
to discriminate between certain mediation schemes (not all schemes, and not
between different UV realizations of a given scheme). We reconstruct gaugino
masses, choosing a model where anomaly contributions to supersymmetry breaking
are important (KKLT compactification), and find the gaugino unification scale.
Moreover, reconstruction of other superpartner masses allows us to solve for
the parameters defining the UV model. The analysis is performed in the stop and
stau coannihilation regions where the lightest neutralinos are mainly gauginos,
to additionally satisfy dark matter constraints. We thus develop observables to
determine stau and stop masses to verify that the coannihilation mechanism is
indeed operational, and solve for the relic density.

neuronal circuits and the synchronization of neuronal activity. However, such

to the more elusive question ""Which areas cause the present activity of which
others?"". Effective connectivity is directed and depends flexibly on contexts
and tasks. Here we show that a dynamic effective connectivity can emerge from
transitions in the collective organization of coherent neural activity.
Integrating simulation and semi-analytic approaches, we study mesoscale network
motifs of interacting cortical areas, modeled as large random networks of
spiking neurons or as simple rate units. Through a causal analysis of
time-series of model neural activity, we show that different dynamical states
generated by a same structural connectivity motif correspond to distinct
effective connectivity motifs. Such effective motifs can display a dominant
directionality, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking and effective entrainment
between local brain rhythms, although all connections in the considered
structural motifs are reciprocal [...] Finally, we analyze how the information
encoded in spiking patterns of a local neuronal population is propagated across
a fixed structural connectivity motif, demonstrating that changes in the active
effective connectivity regulate both the efficiency and the directionality of
information transfer [...] Going beyond these early proposals, we advance here
that dynamic interactions between brain rhythms provide as well the basis for

we investigate the reasons for the discrepancies between the results obtained
with FORS1 and those obtained with other instruments.
  Using the ESO FORS pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure for
magnetic field determination. We have applied this procedure to the full
content of circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the FORS1 archive. We
have devised and applied a number of consistency checks to our field
determinations, and we have compared our results to those previously published
in the literature.
  We find that for high signal-to-noise ratio measurements, photon noise does
not account for the full error bars. We discuss how field measurements depend
on the specific algorithm adopted for data reduction, and we show that very
small instrument flexures, negligible in most of the instrument applications,
may be responsible for some spurious field detections in the null profiles.
Finally, we find that we are unable to reproduce some results previously
published in the literature. Consequently, we do not confirm some important
discoveries of magnetic fields obtained with FORS1 and reported in previous
publications.
  Our revised field measurements show that there is no contradiction between
the results obtained with the low-resolution spectropolarimeter FORS1 and those
obtained with high-resolution spectropolarimeters. FORS1 is an instrument
capable of performing reliable magnetic field measurements, provided that the
various source of uncertainties are properly taken into account.

constraints on models of stellar structure and evolution, especially when
combined with spectroscopic information on their chemical composition.
Empirical calibrations of the data also lead to accurate mass and radius
estimates for exoplanet host stars. Finally, accurate data for unusual stellar
subtypes, such as Am stars, also help to unravel the cause(s) of their
peculiarities. AIMS: We aim to determine the masses, radii, effective
temperatures, detailed chemical composition and rotational speeds for the
Am-type eclipsing binaries SW CMa (A4-5m) and HW CMa (A6m) and compare them
with similar normal stars. METHODS: Accurate radial velocities from the Digital
Speedometers of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics were combined
with previously published uvby photometry to determine precise physical
parameters for the four stars. A detailed abundance analysis was performed from
high-resolution spectra obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma).
RESULTS: We find the masses of the (relatively evolved) stars in SW CMa to be
2.10 and 2.24 solar masses, with radii of 2.50 and 3.01 solar radii, while the
(essentially zero-age) stars in HW CMa have masses of 1.72 and 1.78 solar
masses, radii of 1.64 and 1.66 solar radii -- all with errors well below 2%.
Detailed atmospheric abundances for one or both components were determined for
14 elements in SW CMa ([Fe/H] = +0.49/+0.61 dex) and 16 in HW CMa ([Fe/H] =
+0.33/+0.32 dex); both abundance patterns are characteristic of metallic-line
stars. Both systems are well fit by current stellar evolution models for
assumed bulk abundances of [Fe/H] = +0.05 and +0.23, respectively ([alpha/Fe] =
0.0), and ages of about 700 Myr and 160 Myr.

characterize the occurrence and intensity of low-level accretion onto
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of local early-type field
galaxies. This is accomplished by means of a Large Program targeting a
distance-limited (<30 Mpc) sample of 103 early types spanning a wide range in
stellar masses. We acquired new ACIS-S observations for 61 objects down to a
limiting (0.3-10 keV) luminosity of 2.5x10^38 erg/s, and we include an
additional 42 objects with archival (typically deeper) coverage. A nuclear
X-ray source is detected in 52 out of the 103 galaxies. After accounting for
potential contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries, we estimate that the
fraction of accreting SMBHs within the sample is 45+/-7 percent, which sets a
firm lower limit on the occupation fraction within the field. The measured
nuclear X-ray luminosities are invariably highly sub-Eddington, with
-8<log(L_X/L_Edd)<-4. As also found in a companion survey targeting Virgo early
types, the active fraction increases with increasing host galaxy stellar mass,
reflective of ""Eddington incompleteness"" within the lower-mass objects. For the
Field sample, the average nuclear X-ray luminosity scales with the host stellar
mass as M_star^(0.71+/-0.10), with an intrinsic scatter of 0.73+/-0.09 dex. A
majority of the AMUSE-Field galaxies (78%) inhabits groups, enabling us to
investigate the influence of group richness upon nuclear activity. We see no
evidence for a positive correlation between nuclear X-ray luminosity,
normalized to host properties, and galaxy density. Rather, while the scatter is
substantial, it appears that the Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity of group
members may be slightly lower than for isolated galaxies, and that this trend
continues to cluster early-types.

disturbance, the imaginary part of the generalized weak value does not provide
information pertaining to the observable being measured. What it does provide
is direct information about how the initial state would be unitarily disturbed
by the observable operator. Specifically, we provide an operational
interpretation for the imaginary part of the generalized weak value as the
logarithmic directional derivative of the post-selection probability along the
unitary flow generated by the action of the observable operator. To obtain this
interpretation, we revisit the standard von Neumann measurement protocol for
obtaining the real and imaginary parts of the weak value and solve it exactly
for arbitrary initial states and post-selections using the quantum operations
formalism, which allows us to understand in detail how each part of the
generalized weak value arises in the linear response regime. We also provide
exact treatments of qubit measurements and Gaussian detectors as illustrative
special cases, and show that the measurement disturbance from a Gaussian
detector is purely decohering in the Lindblad sense, which allows the shifts
for a Gaussian detector to be completely understood for any coupling strength
in terms of a single complex weak value that involves the decohered initial
state.

10^11.7-10^14.8 h^-1 Msol. We pay particular attention to how morphology
relates to central (most massive) vs satellite galaxy status. The fraction of
galaxies which are elliptical is a strong function of stellar mass; it is also
a strong function of halo mass, but only for central galaxies. We interpret
this in a scenario where elliptical galaxies are formed, probably via mergers,
as central galaxies within their halos; satellite ellipticals are previously
central galaxies accreted onto larger halos. The overall fraction of S0
galaxies increases strongly with halo mass, from ~10% to ~70%. We find striking
differences between the central and satellites: 20+/-2% of central M_* >
10^10.5 Msol galaxies are S0 regardless of halo mass, but satellite S0 galaxies
are only found in massive (> 10^13 h^-1 Msol) halos, where they are 69+/-4% of
the M_* > 10^10.5 Msol satellite population. This suggests two channels for S0
formation: one for central galaxies, and another which transforms lower mass
(M_* <~ 10^11 Msol) accreted spirals into satellite S0 galaxies in massive
halos. Analysis of finer morphological structure (bars and rings in disk
galaxies) shows some trends with stellar mass, but none with halo mass; this is
consistent with other recent studies which indicate that bars are not strongly
influenced by galaxy environment. Radio sources in high-mass central galaxies
are common, similarly so for elliptical and S0 galaxies, with a frequency that
increases with halo mass. Emission-line AGN (mostly LINERs) are more common in
S0s, but show no strong environmental trends (abridged).

Canada. During recent decades, its population has been reduced due to human
interaction with their habitat. We examine the effect of herbicide usage on the
monarch butterfly's population by creating a system of linear and non-linear
ordinary differential equations that describe the interaction between the
monarch's population and its environment at various stages of migration: spring
migration, summer loitering, and fall migration. The model has various stages
that are used to describe the dynamics of the monarch butterfly population over
multiple generations. In Stage 1, we propose a system of coupled ordinary
differential equations that model the populations of the monarch butterflies
and larvae during spring migration. In Stage 2, we propose a predator-prey
model with age structure to model the population dynamics at the summer
breeding site. In Stages 3 and 4, we propose exponential decay functions to
model the monarch butterfly's fall migration to central Mexico and their time
at the overwintering site. The model is used to analyze the long-term behavior
of the monarch butterflies through numerical analysis, given data available in

a possibly correlated, item-symmetric distribution, allowing different
distributions for each bidder. In the second setting, we allow the values of
each bidder for the items to be arbitrarily correlated, but assume that the
distribution of bidder types is bidder-symmetric.
  For all eps>0, we obtain an additive eps-approximation, when the value
distributions are bounded, or a multiplicative (1-eps)-approximation when the
value distributions are unbounded, but satisfy the Monotone Hazard Rate
condition, covering a widely studied class of distributions in Economics. Our
runtime is polynomial in max{#items,#bidders}, and not the size of the support
of the joint distribution of all bidders' values for all items, which is
typically exponential in both the number of items and the number of bidders.

cyclic-monotonicity, can be harnessed algorithmically. Finally, we provide a
technique that turns any given eps-BIC mechanism (i.e. one where incentive

O(sqrt{eps}) revenue. We expect our tools to be used beyond the settings we

capture the notion of coherence; a notion of global order that quantifies how
closely the formation resembles a solid object. We consider how these measures
scale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in
1, 2 and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1
dimensional case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension
implies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3
being necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations
under certain conditions. In particular, we show that it is impossible to have
large coherent one dimensional vehicular platoons with only local feedback. We
analyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion,
showing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting
in an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in
low spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale
disturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions. This phenomenon is
distinct from, and unrelated to string instability issues which are commonly
encountered in control problems for automated highways.

this emergent degree of freedom of charge carriers, in what is termed

Teague [1], where the players involved in secret sharing play only if it is to
their advantage. This can be characterized in the form of preferences. Players
would prefer to get the secret than to not get it and secondly with lesser
preference, they would like as few other players to get the secret as possible.
Several positive results have already been published to efficiently solve the
problem of rational secret sharing but only a handful of papers have touched
upon the use of an asynchronous broadcast channel. [2] used cryptographic
primitives, [3] used an interactive dealer, and [4] used an honest minority of
players in order to handle an asynchronous broadcast channel.
  In our paper, we propose an m-out-of-n rational secret sharing scheme which
can function over an asynchronous broadcast channel without the use of
cryptographic primitives and with a non-interactive dealer. This is possible
because our scheme uses a small number, k+1, of honest players. The protocol is
resilient to coalitions of size up to k and furthermore it is
{\epsilon}-resilient to coalitions of size up to and including m-1. The
protocol will have a strict Nash equilibrium with probability Pr((k+1)/n) and
an {\epsilon}-Nash equilibrium with probability Pr((n-k-1)/n) . Furthermore,
our protocol is immune to backward induction.
  Later on in the paper, we extend our results to include malicious players as
well.
  We also show that our protocol handles the possibility of a player deviating
in order to force another player to get a wrong value in what we believe to be
a more time efficient manner than was done in Asharov and Lindell [5].

the unfavorable channel characteristics in the underground environment. The
robust Chinese remainder theorem (RCRT) has been shown to be an effective tool

dark energy in a way complementary to other cosmological probes, especially at
high redshifts. However, the apparent magnitude of distant GRBs can be
distorted by the gravitational lensing from the density fluctuations along the
line of sight. We investigate the gravitational lensing effect on the
cosmological parameters and dark energy equation of state from GRBs. We first
calibrated the GRB luminosity relations without assuming any cosmological
models. The luminosity distances of low-redshift GRBs were calibrated with the
cosmography method using a latest type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) sample. We find
that the gravitational lensing has non-negligible effects on the determination
of cosmological parameters and dark energy. The gravitational lensing shifts
the best-fit constraints on cosmological parameters and dark energy. Because
high-redshift GRBs are more likely to be reduced, the most probable value of
the observed matter density $\Omega_M$ is slightly lower than its actual value.
In the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_M$
will shift from 0.30 to 0.26 after including the gravitational lensing effect.
The gravitational lensing also affects the dark energy equation of state by
shifting it to a more negative value. We constrain the dark energy equation of
state out to redshift $z\sim 8$ using GRBs for the first time, and find that
the equation of state deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $1\sigma$ confidence
level, but agrees with $w=-1$ at the $2\sigma$ confidence level.

product uncertainty, thereby reducing the overall costs. The back-bone of this
frame-work is the development of Domain Specific Operational (DOP) Model and
the associated Verification Instrumentation for Test and Evaluation, developed
based on the DOP model. Together they generate functionally valid test-sequence

methodologies can be compared by defining and computing a generic performance
criterion like Average design-cycle Risk. For the case study, by computing
Average design-cycle Risk, it is shown that the adaptive method reduces the

the possible reasons for the anomalous M/L. We infer that in most cases this is
a result of errors in photometry or rotational velocity, however for some
galaxies we cannot exclude the real peculiarities of the galactic stellar
population. The comparison of the photometric and dynamical mass estimates in
the disk shows that the low M/L values for a given color of disks are probably
real for a few our galaxies: NGC 4826 (Sab), NGC 5347 (Sab), and NGC 6814 (Sb).
The small number of such galaxies suggests that the stellar initial mass
function is indeed universal, and that only a small fraction of galaxies may
have a non-typical low-mass star depleted initial mass function. Such galaxies
require more careful studies for understanding their star formation history.

component which is modulated by stimulus properties. It has been argued that
synchronized oscillations contribute to these gamma-band activity [...
however,] even when oscillations are observed, they undergo temporal
decorrelation over very few cycles. This is not easily accounted for in
previous network modeling of gamma oscillations. We argue here that
interactions between cortical layers can be responsible for this fast
decorrelation. We study a model of a V1 hypercolumn, embedding a simplified
description of the multi-layered structure of the cortex. When the stimulus
contrast is low, the induced activity is only weakly synchronous and the
network resonates transiently without developing collective oscillations. When
the contrast is high, on the other hand, the induced activity undergoes
synchronous oscillations with an irregular spatiotemporal structure expressing
a synchronous chaotic state. As a consequence the population activity undergoes
fast temporal decorrelation, with concomitant rapid damping of the oscillations
in LFPs autocorrelograms and peak broadening in LFPs power spectra. [...]
Finally, we argue that the mechanism underlying the emergence of synchronous
chaos in our model is in fact very general. It stems from the fact that gamma
oscillations induced by local delayed inhibition tend to develop chaos when
coupled by sufficiently strong excitation.

constrains in the parameter space for the reducibility of the invariant curve.

codimension one bifurcation and we study its interaction with the period
doubling bifurcation. This reveals that, if the reducibility loss and the
period doubling bifurcation curves meet, they do it in a tangent way.

space valued martingales associated to the PDMPs. Furthermore, these limit
theorems provide the basis for a general Langevin approximation to PDMPs, i.e.,
stochastic partial differential equations that are expected to be similar in
their dynamics to PDMPs. We apply these results to compartmental-type models of
