paper, we study parity games on graphs with bounded treewidth, and graphs with
bounded DAG width. We show that parity games with bounded DAG width can be
solved in O(n^(k+3) k^(k + 2) (d + 1)^(3k + 2)) time, where n, k, and d are the
size, treewidth, and number of priorities in the parity game. This is an
improvement over the previous best algorithm, given by Berwanger et al., which
runs in n^O(k^2) time. We also show that, if a tree decomposition is provided,
then parity games with bounded treewidth can be solved in O(n k^(k + 5) (d +
1)^(3k + 5)) time. This improves over previous best algorithm, given by
Obdrzalek, which runs in O(n d^(2(k+1)^2)) time. Our techniques can also be
adapted to show that the problem of solving parity games with bounded treewidth
lies in the complexity class NC^2, which is the class of problems that can be
efficiently parallelized. This is in stark contrast to the general parity game
problem, which is known to be P-hard, and thus unlikely to be contained in NC.

""Life"" and ""intelligence"", i.e. an attempt to define these words. The word
""definition"" refers to two different situations. First, it means an arbitrary
convention. On the other hand it also often designates an attempt to clarify
the content of a pre-existing word for which we have some spontaneous
preconceptions, whatever their grounds, and to catch an (illusory) ""essence"" of
what is defined. It is then made use of pre-existing plain language words which
carry an a priori pre-scientific content likely to introduce some confusion in
the reader's mind. The complexity of the problem will be analyzed and we will
show that some philosophical prejudice is unavoidable. There are two types of
philosophy: ""Natural Philosophy"", seeking for some essence of things, and
""Critical (or analytical) Philosophy"", devoted to the analysis of the
procedures by which we claim to construct a reality. An extension of Critical
Philosophy, Epistemo-Analysis (i.e. the Psycho-Analysis of concepts) is

coorbital motion from synthetic radial velocity (RV) signals, taking into
account different types of stable planar configurations, orbital eccentricities
and mass ratios. For each nominal solution corresponding to small-amplitude
oscillations around the periodic solution, we generate a series of synthetic RV
curves mimicking the stellar motion around the barycenter of the system. We
then fit the data sets obtained assuming three possible different orbital
architectures: (a) two planets in coorbital motion, (b) two planets in a 2/1
mean-motion resonance, and (c) a single planet. We compare the resulting
residuals and the estimated orbital parameters.
  For synthetic data sets covering only a few orbital periods, we find that the
discrete radial velocity signal generated by a coorbital configuration could be
easily confused with other configurations/systems, and in many cases the best
orbital fit corresponds to either a single planet or two bodies in a 2/1
resonance. However, most of the incorrect identifications are associated to
dynamically unstable solutions.
  We also compare the orbital parameters obtained with two different fitting
strategies: a simultaneous fit of two planets and a nested multi-Keplerian
model. We find that the nested models can yield incorrect orbital
configurations (sometimes close to fictitious mean-motion resonances) that are
nevertheless dynamically stable and with orbital eccentricities lower than the
correct nominal solutions.
  Finally, we discuss plausible mechanisms for the formation of coorbital
configurations, by the interaction between two giant planets and an inner
cavity in the gas disk. For equal mass planets, both Lagrangian and
anti-Lagrangian configurations can be obtained from same initial condition
depending on final time of integration.

one to include important aspects of these virtual interband excitations. Within
a simplified two-patch treatment of the conduction band, we demonstrate that
these corrections can have a rather strong effect in parts of the phase diagram

Morgan and the Discovery of the Spiral Arm Structure of our Galaxy","21 pages in Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage",,,,"physics.hist-ph astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  William Wilson Morgan was one of the great astronomers of the twentieth
century. He considered himself a morphologist, and was preoccupied throughout
his career with matters of classification. Though his early life was difficult,
and his pursuit of astronomy as a career was opposed by his father, he took a
position at Yerkes Observatory in 1926 and remained there for the rest of his
working life. Thematically, his work was also a unified whole. Beginning with
spectroscopic studies under Otto Struve at Yerkes Observatory, by the late
1930s he concentrated particularly on the young O and B stars. His work on
stellar classification led to the Morgan-Keenan- Kellman [MKK] system of
classification of stars, and later - as he grappled with the question of the
intrinsic color and brightness of stars at great distances - to the
Johnson-Morgan UBV system for measuring stellar colors. Eventually these
concerns with classification and method led to his greatest single achievement
- the recognition of the nearby spiral arms of our Galaxy by tracing the OB
associations and HII regions that outline them. After years of intensive work
on the problem of galactic structure, the discovery came in a blinding flash of
Archimedean insight as he walked under the night sky between his office and his
house in the autumn of 1951. His optical discovery of the spiral arms preceded
the radio-mapping of the spiral arms by more than a year. Morgan suffered a
nervous breakdown soon after he announced his discovery, however, and so was
prevented from publishing a complete account of his work. As a result of that,
and the announcement soon afterward of the first radio maps of the spiral arms,
the uniqueness of his achievement was not fully appreciated at the time.

  Problems","46 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we define and study the new problem Simultaneous PQ-Ordering.
Its input consists of a set of PQ-trees, which represent sets of circular
orders of their leaves, together with a set of child-parent relations between
these PQ-trees, such that the leaves of the child form a subset of the leaves
of the parent. Simultaneous PQ-Ordering asks whether orders of the leaves of
each of the trees can be chosen simultaneously, that is, for every child-parent
relation the order chosen for the parent is an extension of the order chosen
for the child. We show that Simultaneous PQ-Ordering is NP-complete in general
and that it is efficiently solvable for a special subset of instances, the
2-fixed instances. We then show that several constrained embedding problems can
be formulated as such 2-fixed instances.
  In particular, we obtain a linear-time algorithm for Partially PQ-Constrained
Planarity for biconnected graphs, a common generalization of two recently
considered embedding problems, and a quadratic-time algorithm for Simultaneous
Embedding with Fixed Edges for biconnected graphs with a connected
intersection; formerly only the much more restricted case that the intersection
is biconnected was known to be efficiently solvable. Both results can be
extended to the case where the input graphs are not necessarily biconnected but
have the property that each cutvertex is contained in at most two non-trivial
blocks. This includes for example the case where both graphs have maximum
degree 5. Moreover, we give an optimal linear-time algorithm for recognition of
simultaneous interval graphs, improving upon a recent O(n^2 log n)-time
algorithm due to Jampani and Lubiw and show that this can be used to also solve
the problem of extending partial interval representations of graphs with n

evolution of CaII and NaI. Three main absorption systems are identified from
CaII and NaI, one associated to the Milky Way, one probably arising within a
high-velocity cloud, and one most likely associated to the halo of M101. The
Galactic and host galaxy reddening, deduced from the integrated equivalent
widths (EW) of the NaI lines are E(B-V)=0.011+/-0.002 and E(B-V)=0.014+/-0.002

detected at the same velocity measured from the 21-cm HI line at the projected
SN position (~180 km/s). During the ~3 months covered by our observations, its
EW changed by 15.6+/-6.5 mA. This small variation is shown to be compatible
with the geometric effects produced by therapid SN photosphere expansion
coupled to the patchy fractal structure of the ISM. The observed behavior is
fully consistent with ISM properties similar to those derived for our own

agents at given distances from each other, with the constraint that an agent's
dynamics can depend only on a subset of other agents. When the information flow
graph of the system, which encodes this dependency, is acyclic, simple control
laws are known to globally stabilize the system, save for a set of measure zero
of initial conditions. The situation has proven to be more complex when the
graph contains cycles; in fact, with the exception of the cyclic formation with
three agents, which is stabilized with laws similar to the ones of the acyclic
case, very little is known about formations with cycles. Moreover, all of the
control laws used in the acyclic case fail at stabilizing more complex cyclic
formations. In this paper, we explain why this is the case and show that a
large class of planar formations with cycles cannot be globally stabilized,
even up to sets of measure zero of initial conditions. The approach rests on
relating the information flow to singularities in the dynamics of formations.
These singularities are in turn shown to make the existence of stable
configurations that do not satisfy the prescribed edge lengths generic.

state transfer to a great extent. In this paper, we consider the transfer of a
Gaussian state of light to a linear medium memory such as an opto-mechanical
oscillator and propose a dynamical feedback controller that suppresses the
noise in the memory system. To protect an unknown state, the feedback scheme
employs the specific configuration of the quantum error correction; that is, a
three-mode Gaussian state having appropriate syndromes is taken as the input.
Correspondingly, the memory consists of three independent linear systems. The
syndrome errors are estimated continuously in time through the measurement of
the output field, and the results are then fed back to control the system.
Because the input is Gaussian and the systems are all linear, it is possible to
formulate the problem using the framework of the celebrated classical Kalman
filtering and linear quadratic Gaussian control. A numerical simulation
demonstrates the effectiveness of the control scheme.

controlled by the dimensionless monopole density $x$ which defines the ratio of

in situations where other criteria, such as the energy gap criterion or the
extent of population transfer, fail. We further propose to estimate this
quantum fidelity efficiently with a generalization of the dephasing
representation to multiple surfaces. Two variants of the multiple-surface
dephasing representation (MSDR) are introduced, in which the nuclei are
propagated either with the fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) or with the
locally mean field dynamics (LMFD). The LMFD can be interpreted as the
Ehrenfest dynamics of an ensemble of nuclear trajectories, and has been used
previously in the nonadiabatic semiclassical initial value representation. In
addition to propagating an ensemble of classical trajectories, the MSDR
requires evaluating nonadiabatic couplings and solving the Schr\""{o}dinger (or
more generally, the quantum Liouville-von Neumann) equation for a single
discrete degree of freedom. The MSDR can be also used to measure the importance
of other terms present in the molecular Hamiltonian, such as diabatic
couplings, spin-orbit couplings, or couplings to external fields, and to
evaluate the accuracy of quantum dynamics with an approximate nonadiabatic
Hamiltonian. The method is tested on three model problems introduced by Tully,
on a two-surface model of dissociation of NaI, and a three-surface model
including spin-orbit interactions. An example is presented that demonstrates
the importance of often-neglected second-order nonadiabatic couplings.

experiment detailing the behavior of the transverse acoustic [110] phonon in
BaFe2As2 as a function of temperature. When cooling through the structural
transition temperature, the transverse acoustic phonon energy is reduced from
the value at room temperature, reaching a maximum shift near inelastic momentum
transfer q=0.1. This softening of the lattice results in a change of the
symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic at the same temperature as the
transition to long-range antiferromagnetic order. While the lattice distortion
is minor, the anisotropy in the magnetic exchange constants in pnictide parent
compounds is large. We suggest mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling to
describe the interaction between the lattice softening and onset of magnetic

sequential activation of a series of proteins following the reception of an
input signal. Here we study the classic model of weakly activated cascades and
obtain analytical solutions for a variety of inputs. We show that in the
special but important case of optimal-gain cascades (i.e., when the
deactivation rates are identical) the downstream output of the cascade can be
represented exactly as a lumped nonlinear module containing an incomplete gamma
function with real parameters that depend on the rates and length of the
cascade, as well as parameters of the input signal. The expressions obtained
can be applied to the non-identical case when the deactivation rates are random
to capture the variability in the cascade outputs. We also show that cascades
can be rearranged so that blocks with similar rates can be lumped and
represented through our nonlinear modules. Our results can be used both to
represent cascades in computational models of differential equations and to fit
data efficiently, by reducing the number of equations and parameters involved.
In particular, the length of the cascade appears as a real-valued parameter and
can thus be fitted in the same manner as Hill coefficients. Finally, we show
how the obtained nonlinear modules can be used instead of delay differential
equations to model delays in signal transduction.

solids; but how do protoplanets acquire their mass? There are many, often
competing processes that regulate the accretion rate of protoplanets. To assess
their effects we present a new, publicly-available toy model. The rationale
behind the toy model is that it encompasses as many physically-relevant
processes as possible, but at the same time does not compromise its simplicity,
speed, and physical insight. The toy model follows a modular structure, where
key features -- e.g. planetesimal fragmentation, radial orbital decay, nebula
turbulence -- can be switched on or off. Our model assumes three discrete
components (fragments, planetesimals, and embryos) and is zero dimensional in
space. We have tested the outcomes of the toy model against literature results
and generally find satisfactory agreement. We include, for the first time,
model features that capture the three-way interactions among small particles,
gas, and protoplanets. Collisions among planetesimals will result in
fragmentation, transferring a substantial amount of the solid mass to small
particles, which couple strongly to the gas. Our results indicate that the
efficiency of the accretion process then becomes very sensitive to the gas
properties -- especially to the turbulent state and the magnitude of the disk
headwind (the decrease of the orbital velocity of the gas with respect to
Keplerian) -- as well as to the characteristic fragment size.

the bulk viscosity of the hadron gas is much larger than the bulk viscosity of

a negative contribution of turbulence to the effective mean Lorentz force (the

large-scale inhomogeneous magnetic structures from initial uniform magnetic
field. Earlier investigations of this instability in DNS of stably stratified,
externally forced, isothermal hydromagnetic turbulence in the regime of large
plasma beta are now extended into the regime of larger scale separation ratios
where the number of turbulent eddies in the computational domain is about 30.
Strong spontaneous formation of large-scale magnetic structures is seen even
without performing any spatial averaging. These structures encompass many
turbulent eddies. The characteristic time of the instability is comparable to
the turbulent diffusion time, L^2/eta_t, where eta_t is the turbulent
diffusivity and L is the scale of the domain. DNS are used to confirm that the
effective magnetic pressure does indeed become negative for magnetic field
strengths below the equipartition field. The dependence of the effective
magnetic pressure on the field strength is characterized by fit parameters that

wide binaries that consist of a main sequence star and a white dwarf. The
temperature and gravity of each white dwarf was measured by fitting theoretical
model atmospheres to the observed spectrum using a $\chi^{2}$ fitting
algorithm. The cooling time and mass was obtained using theoretical cooling
tracks. The total age of each binary was estimated from the chromospheric
activity of its main sequence component to an uncertainty of about 0.17 dex in
log \textit{t} The difference between the total age and white dwarf cooling
time is taken as the main sequence lifetime of each white dwarf. The initial
mass of each white dwarf was then determined using stellar evolution tracks
with a corresponding metallicity derived from spectra of their main sequence
companions, thus yielding the initial-final mass relation. Most of the initial
masses of the white dwarf components are between 1 - 2 M$_{\odot}$. Our results

called Multifractal Temporally Weighted Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(MF-TWDFA), which exploits the intuition that points closer in time are more
likely to be related than distant points. In both data sets we extract multiple
crossover times, as characterized by generalized Hurst exponents, ranging from
synoptic to decadal. The method goes beyond treatments that assume a single
decay scale process, such as a first-order autoregression, which cannot be
justifiably fit to these observations. Importantly, the strength of the
seasonal cycle ""masks"" long term correlations on time scales beyond seasonal.
When removing the seasonal cycle from the original record, the ice extent data
exhibits white noise behavior from seasonal to bi-seasonal time scales, whereas
the clear fingerprints of the short (weather) and long ($\sim$ 7 and 9 year)
time scales remain, the latter associated with the recent decay in the ice
cover. Therefore, long term persistence is reentrant beyond the seasonal scale
and it is not possible to distinguish whether a given ice extent

clusters, i.e., groups of variables which are strongly related to each other
and thus bring the same information. These approaches can then be useful for
dimension reduction and variable selection. Several specific methods have been
developed for the clustering of numerical variables. However concerning
qualitative variables or mixtures of quantitative and qualitative variables,
far fewer methods have been proposed. The R package ClustOfVar was specifically
developed for this purpose. The homogeneity criterion of a cluster is defined
as the sum of correlation ratios (for qualitative variables) and squared
correlations (for quantitative variables) to a synthetic quantitative variable,
summarizing ""as good as possible"" the variables in the cluster. This synthetic
variable is the first principal component obtained with the PCAMIX method. Two
algorithms for the clustering of variables are proposed: iterative relocation
algorithm and ascendant hierarchical clustering. We also propose a bootstrap
approach in order to determine suitable numbers of clusters. We illustrate the
methodologies and the associated package on small datasets.

involving a metric and a single scalar field. These models can be obtained by
starting with a set of ultralight pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons whose couplings
to matter satisfy the weak equivalence principle, assuming that one boson is
lighter than all the others, and integrating out the heavier fields. The result
is a quintessence model with matter coupling, together with a series of
correction terms in the action in a covariant derivative expansion, with
specific scalings for the coefficients. After eliminating higher derivative
terms and exploiting the field redefinition freedom, we show that the resulting
theory contains nine independent free functions of the scalar field when
truncated at four derivatives. This is in contrast to the four free functions
found in similar theories of single-field inflation, where matter is not
present. We discuss several different representations of the theory that can be
obtained using the field redefinition freedom. For perturbations to the
quintessence field today on subhorizon lengthscales larger than the Compton
wavelength of the heavy fields, the theory is weakly coupled and natural in the
sense of t'Hooft. The theory admits a regime where the perturbations become
modestly nonlinear, but very strong nonlinearities lie outside its domain of
validity.

The bispectrum is calibration independent, resistant to interference, and
computationally efficient, so it can be built into correlators for real-time
transient detection. Our technique could find celestial transients anywhere in
the field of view and localize them to arcsecond precision. At the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), such a system would have a high survey speed and
a 5-sigma sensitivity of 38 mJy on 10 ms timescales with 1 GHz of bandwidth.
The ability to localize dispersed millisecond pulses to arcsecond precision in
large volumes of interferometer data has several unique science applications.
Localizing individual pulses from Galactic pulsars will help find X-ray
counterparts that define their physical properties, while finding host galaxies
of extragalactic transients will measure the electron density of the
intergalactic medium with a single dispersed pulse. Exoplanets and active stars
have distinct millisecond variability that can be used to identify them and
probe their magnetospheres. We use millisecond time scale visibilities from the
Allen Telescope Array (ATA) and VLA to show that the bispectrum can detect
dispersed pulses and reject local interference. The computational and data
efficiency of the bispectrum will help find transients on a range of time

Heun functions. In this article, for the first time, we use those exact
solutions to obtain the electromagnetic (EM) quasinormal spectra of the Kerr
black hole . This is done by imposing the appropriate boundary conditions on
the solutions and solving numerically the so-obtained two-dimensional
transcendental system.
  The EM QNM spectra are compared with already published results, evaluated
through the continued fraction method. The comparison shows that the modes with
lower $n$ coincide for both methods, while those with higher $n$ may
demonstrate significant deviations. To study those deviations, we employ the
$\epsilon$-method which introduces small variations in the argument of the
complex radial variable. Using the $\epsilon$-method one can move in the
complex $r-$plane the branch cuts of the solutions of the radial equation and
examine the dependence of the spectrum on their position.
  For different values of $\epsilon$, one can obtain both the frequencies
evaluated through the well-established continued fraction method or somewhat
different spectra calculated here for the first time. This result raises the
question what spectrum should be compared with the observational data and why.
This choice should come from better understanding of the physics of the problem

young recently quenched (""post-starburst"") galaxies at z>1 that are almost
non-existent at z<1; their number density is 5 x 10^{-5} Mpc^{-3} at z=2,

smaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, in
agreement with other recent studies. Interestingly, the most recently quenched
galaxies at 1<z<2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than older
galaxies at those redshifts. This result is inconsistent with the idea that the
evolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven by
continuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, the
youngest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. Instead, mergers or
other mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescent

The various runs differ in their hydrodynamical treatment (SPH, moving-mesh and
AMR) but share the same initial conditions and adopt their latest published
model of cooling, star formation and feedback. Despite the common halo assembly
history, we find large code-to-code variations in the stellar mass, size,
morphology and gas content of the galaxy at z=0, due mainly to the different
implementations of feedback. Compared with observation, most codes tend to
produce an overly massive galaxy, smaller and less gas-rich than typical
spirals, with a massive bulge and a declining rotation curve. A stellar disk is
discernible in most simulations, though its prominence varies widely from code
to code. There is a well-defined trend between the effects of feedback and the
severity of the disagreement with observation. Models that are more effective
at limiting the baryonic mass of the galaxy come closer to matching observed
galaxy scaling laws, but often to the detriment of the disk component. Our
conclusions hold at two different numerical resolutions. Some differences can
also be traced to the numerical techniques: more gas seems able to cool and
become available for star formation in grid-based codes than in SPH. However,
this effect is small compared to the variations induced by different feedback
prescriptions. We conclude that state-of-the-art simulations cannot yet
uniquely predict the properties of the baryonic component of a galaxy, even
when the assembly history of its host halo is fully specified. Developing
feedback algorithms that can effectively regulate the mass of a galaxy without
hindering the formation of high-angular momentum stellar disks remains a
challenge.

average cooling rate matches the decay rate of turbulent energy into the
medium. Here we carry out a set of numerical simulations of a stratified,

turbulent velocities below ~35 km/s, corresponding to temperatures below

substantial fraction of the interstellar medium is unable to cool on a

uncertainties. The clustering of SMGs at z ~ 2 is consistent with measurements
for optically-selected quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), supporting evolutionary
scenarios linking starbursts and QSOs. Given that SMGs reside in haloes of
characteristic mass ~ 6 x 10^12 h^-1 M_sun, we demonstrate that the redshift
distribution of SMGs can be described remarkably well by the combination of two
effects: the cosmological growth of structure and the evolution of the
molecular gas fraction in galaxies. We conclude that the powerful starbursts in
SMGs likely represent a short-lived but universal phase in massive galaxy
evolution, associated with the transition between cold gas-rich, star-forming
galaxies and passively evolving systems. [Abridged]

[O/Fe] ratios (most often represented by [{\alpha}/Fe] in the literature) with
velocity dispersion. We further derive identical correlations with velocity
dispersion for the abundance ratios [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe], implying that
C/Mg and C/O are close to solar values. This sets a lower limit on the
formation time-scales and star-burst components of early-type galaxies to ~0.4
Gyr, which is the lifetime of a 3Msun star, since the full C enrichment must be
reached. [N/Fe] correlates with velocity dispersion, but offset to lower values
and with a steeper slope compared to the other element ratios. We do not find
any environmental dependencies for the abundances of C and N, contrary to
previous reports in the literature. [Fe/H] does not correlate with velocity
dispersion over the entire parameter range covered, but for fixed age we find a
steep trend for the [Fe/H]-{\sigma} relation. This trend is weaker than the
analogous for total metallicity (which also shows steeper trends at fixed age)
owing to the lower Fe contribution from SN Ia for more massive early-type
galaxies. We find [Ca/Fe] ratios that are close to solar values over the entire
velocity dispersion range covered. Tentative, due to large scatter, the results
for [Ti/Fe] indicate that Ti follows the trends of Ca. This implies a
significant contribution from SN Ia to the enrichment of heavy
{\alpha}-elements and puts strong constraints on supernova nucleosynthesis and
models of galactic chemical evolution.

discuss HST imaging of submm lenses, lensed galaxy reconstruction, the

Many emission line diagnostics are relatively unaffected by differential

infrared galaxies are so unreliable as to be useless, unless a lens mass model
is available to correct for differential amplification.

out for future X-ray surveys which have enough sensitivity to provide accurate
measurements of X-ray mass proxies and Fe-line based redshifts for about 2x10^4
clusters. We base our analysis on the Fisher Matrix formalism, by combining
information on the cluster number counts and power spectrum, also including,
for the first time in the analysis of the large scale cluster distribution, the
effect of linear redshift-space distortions (RSDs). This study is performed
with the main purpose of dissecting the cosmological information provided by
geometrical and growth tests, which are both included in the analysis of number
counts and clustering of galaxy clusters. We compare cosmological constraints
obtained by assuming different levels of prior knowledge of the parameters
which define the observable-mass X-ray relation. This comparison further
demonstrates the fundamental importance of having a well calibrated
observable-mass relation and, most importantly, its redshift evolution. Such a
calibration can be achieved only by having at least $\sim 10^3$ net photon
counts for each cluster included in the survey. We show that RSDs in the power
spectrum analysis carry important cosmological information also when traced
with galaxy clusters and the DE FoM increases by a factor of 8. Besides
confirming the potential that large cluster surveys have in constraining the
nature of DE, our analysis emphasizes that a full exploitation of the
cosmological information carried by such surveys requires not only a large
statistic but also a robust measurement of the mass proxies and redshifts for a
significant fraction of the cluster sample, derived from the same X-ray survey

demonstrated, that is, of different field theories which share the same
topological defect solution with the same energy density. Further, purely
algebraic conditions have been derived which the corresponding Lagrangians have
to obey in order that the field theories be twins of each other. A further
diagnostical tool which, in general, allows to distinguish the topological
defects of a given theory from the corresponding defects of its twins is the
spectrum of linear fluctuations about these defects. Very recently, however,
explicit examples of twin theories have been constructed such that not only
their shapes and energy densities coincide, but also their linear fluctuation
spectra are the same. Here we show that, again, there exist purely algebraic
conditions for the Lagrangian densities which imply that the corresponding
field theories are twins and that the fluctuation spectra about their defects
coincide. These algebraic conditions allow to construct an infinite number of
twins with coinciding fluctuation spectra for a given theory, and we provide
some explicit examples. The importance of this result is related to the fact
that coinciding defects with coinciding energy densities and identical
fluctuation spectra are almost indistinguishable physically, that is,
indistinguishable in a linear or semiclassical approximation. This implies that
the measurable physical properties of a kink, in general, do not allow to
determine the theory which provides the kink uniquely. Instead, in principle an
infinite number of possible theories has to be considered.

in this paradigm. We do this in two different ways: with the halo model

simulations. Combining these quasi-independent approaches, leads to a physical
understanding of the important processes which shape the formation of
structures. We take a detailed look at the halo mass function, the
concentrations and the linear halo bias of WDM. In all cases we find
interesting deviations with respect to CDM. In particular, the
concentration-mass relation displays a turnover for group scale dark matter
haloes, for the case of WDM particles with masses of the order ~0.25 keV. This
may be interpreted as a hint for top-down structure formation on small scales.
We implement our results into the halo model and find much better agreement
with simulations. On small scales the WDM halo model now performs as well as
its CDM counterpart.

practical importance to quantum information processing because it helps to
reduce decoherence effects and improve robustness to additive control field

necessary to implement a variety of quantum gates on coupled-spin qubit
systems. This work focuses on exploring the Pareto front that quantifies the
trade-off between the competitive objectives of maximizing the gate fidelity
$\mathcal{F}$ and minimizing the control time $T$. In order to identify the
critical time $T^{\ast}$, below which the target transformation is not
reachable, as well as to determine the associated Pareto front, we introduce a
numerical method of Pareto front tracking (PFT). We consider closed two- and
multi-qubit systems with constant inter-qubit coupling strengths and each
individual qubit controlled by a separate time-dependent external field. Our
analysis demonstrates that unit fidelity (to a desired numerical accuracy) can
be achieved at any $T \geq T^{\ast}$ in most cases. However, the optimization
search effort rises superexponentially as $T$ decreases and approaches
$T^{\ast}$. Furthermore, a small decrease in control time incurs a significant
penalty in fidelity for $T < T^{\ast}$, indicating that it is generally
undesirable to operate below the critical time. We investigate the dependence
of the critical time $T^{\ast}$ on the coupling strength between qubits and the
target gate transformation. Practical consequences of these findings for
laboratory implementation of quantum gates are discussed.

a database. The evaluation and optimization of such queries is an intriguing
new problem for database research.
  In this paper we discuss two important aspects of this problem: query
rewriting and query optimization. Query rewriting consists of the compilation
of an ontological query into an equivalent query against the underlying
relational database. The focus here is on soundness and completeness. We review
previous results and present a new rewriting algorithm for rather general types
of ontological constraints.
  In particular, we show how a conjunctive query against an ontology can be
compiled into a union of conjunctive queries against the underlying database.
Ontological query optimization, in this context, attempts to improve this
process so to produce possibly small and cost-effective UCQ rewritings for an
input query. We review existing optimization methods, and propose an effective
new method that works for linear Datalog+/-, a class of Datalog-based rules
that encompasses well-known description logics of the DL-Lite family.

  London",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mathematical framework of Stone duality is used to synthesize a number of
hitherto separate developments in Theoretical Computer Science: - Domain
Theory, the mathematical theory of computation introduced by Scott as a
foundation for denotational semantics. - The theory of concurrency and systems
behaviour developed by Milner, Hennessy et al. based on operational semantics.
- Logics of programs.
  Stone duality provides a junction between semantics (spaces of points =
denotations of computational processes) and logics (lattices of properties of
processes). Moreover, the underlying logic is geometric, which can be
computationally interpreted as the logic of observable properties---i.e.
properties which can be determined to hold of a process on the basis of a
finite amount of information about its execution.
  These ideas lead to the following programme:
  1. A metalanguage is introduced, comprising
  - types = universes of discourse for various computational situations.
  - terms = programs = syntactic intensions for models or points.
  2. A standard denotational interpretation of the metalanguage is given,
assigning domains to types and domain elements to terms.
  3. The metalanguage is also given a {\em logical} interpretation, in which
types are interpreted as propositional theories and terms are interpreted via a
program logic, which axiomatizes the properties they satisfy.
  4. The two interpretations are related by showing that they are Stone duals
of each other. Hence, semantics and logic are guaranteed to be in harmony with
each other, and in fact each determines the other up to isomorphism.
  This opens the way to a whole range of applications. Given a denotational
description of a computational situation in our meta-language, we can turn the
handle to obtain a logic for that situation.

inequalities describing the facet defining hyperplanes of the stability region
polytope. We further derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
stability of the system for general arrival processes with finite first and
second moments. For the case of stationary arrival processes, the derived
conditions characterize the system stability region. Furthermore, we obtain an
upper bound for the average queueing delay of Maximum Weight (MW) server
allocation policy which has been shown in the literature to be a throughput
optimal policy for MQMS systems. Using a similar approach, we can characterize
the stability region for a fluid model MQMS system. However, the stability
region of the fluid model system is described by an infinite number of linear
inequalities since in this case the stability region is a convex surface. We
present an example where we show that in some cases depending on the channel

data. The problem we consider is a generalization of the Lichnerowicz equation
that one encounters in studying the constraint equations in general relativity.
Our method for solving this problem consists of solving a net of regularized,
semilinear problems with data obtained by smoothing the original,
distributional coefficients. In order to solve these regularized problems, we
develop a priori pointwise bounds and sub- and super-solutions and then apply a
fixed-point argument for order-preserving maps. We then show that the net of
solutions obtained through this process satisfies certain decay estimates by
determining estimates for the sub- and super-solutions and by utilizing
classical, a priori elliptic estimates. The estimates for this net of solutions
allow us to regard this collection of functions as a solution in a
Colombeau-type algebra. We motivate this Colombeau algebra framework by first
solving an ill-posed critical exponent problem. To solve this ill-posed
problem, we use a collection of smooth, ""approximating"" problems and then use
the resulting sequence of solutions and a compactness argument to obtain a
solution to the original problem. This approach is modeled after the more
general Colombeau framework that we develop, and it conveys the potential that
solutions in these abstract spaces have for obtaining classical solutions to
ill-posed nonlinear problems with irregular data.

screening effects in the quark-gluon plasma. If the suppression is nearly
complete close to the chiral transition temperature, this can have consequences
for the nature of the phase transition. The use of a chiral action such as
Domain Wall Fermions allows us to gain a deeper insight into the issue. Our
lattice sizes were $16^3\times 8\times L_s$, with $L_s=32$ or 48, and our pion
mass was approximately 200 MeV. We found that $U(1)_A$ stayed broken above the
chiral transition. However the breaking was found to be due to topologically
nontrivial configurations which raises the question as to whether it persists
in the thermodynamic limit. We also present results for the eigenvalue density
of the Dirac operator. It is seen that although the density decreases
dramatically across the chiral transition temperature, $U(1)_A$ still remains
broken at our current volume and quark mass due to the presence of zero modes.

from dust in these systems. We find excesses around eight stars, indicating the
presence of warm to hot dust (~100-500 K), corresponding to orbital distances
of 0.1-10 AU for these solar-type stars. The strongest detection, KOI 1099,
demands ~500 K dust interior to the orbit of its exoplanet candidate. One star,
KOI 904, may host very hot dust (~1200 K, corresponding to 0.02 AU). Although
the fraction of these exoplanet-bearing stars with detectable warm excesses
(~3%) is similar to that found by Spitzer surveys of solar-type field stars,
the excesses detectable in the WISE data have much higher fractional
luminosities (Ldust/L*) than most known debris disks, implying that the
fraction with debris disks of comparable luminosity may actually be
significantly higher. It is difficult to explain the presence of dust so close

the collisional and Poynting-Robertson drag timescales to remove dust from the

erasures. We address the \emph{rebuilding ratio} problem, namely, in the case
of erasures, what is the fraction of the remaining information that needs to be
accessed in order to rebuild \emph{exactly} the lost information? It is clear
that when the number of erasures equals the maximum number of erasures that an
MDS code can correct then the rebuilding ratio is 1 (access all the remaining
information). However, the interesting and more practical case is when the
number of erasures is smaller than the erasure correcting capability of the
code. For example, consider an MDS code that can correct two erasures: What is
the smallest amount of information that one needs to access in order to correct
a single erasure? Previous work showed that the rebuilding ratio is bounded
between 1/2 and 3/4, however, the exact value was left as an open problem. In
this paper, we solve this open problem and prove that for the case of a single
erasure with a 2-erasure correcting code, the rebuilding ratio is 1/2. In
general, we construct a new family of $r$-erasure correcting MDS array codes
that has optimal rebuilding ratio of $\frac{e}{r}$ in the case of $e$ erasures,
$1 \le e \le r$. Our array codes have efficient encoding and decoding
algorithms (for the case $r=2$ they use a finite field of size 3) and an
optimal update property.

both $\sigma$ and $\pi$ incident x-rays at two different azimuthal angles, as
well as the ratio $I_\sigma/I_\pi$ as a function of azimuthal angle for a
selection of energies, allows a determination of the higher order multipole
moments of rank 1 (dipole) to 6 (hexacontatetrapole). The Ho 4f multipole
moments have been estimated, indicating a dominant hexadecapole (rank 4) order
with an almost negligible influence from either the dipole or the octupole
magnetic terms. The analysis incorporates both the intra-atomic magnetic and
quadrupolar interactions between the 3d core and 4f valence shells as well as
the interference of contributions to the scattering that behave differently
under time reversal. Comparison of SRXD, neutron diffraction and non resonant
x-ray diffraction shows that the magnetic and quadrupolar order parameter are
distinct. The $(0 0 1/2)$ component of the magnetic order exhibits a Brillouin
type increase below the orbital ordering temperature T$_Q$, while the
quadrupolar order increases more sharply. We conclude the quadrupolar
interaction is strong, but quadrupolar order only occurs when the magnetic
order gives rise to a quasi doublet ground state, which results in a lock-in of
the orbitals at T$_Q$.

certain properties are required in various communication systems. Traditional
signal sets consider only the time distortion during transmission. Recently,
signal sets against both the time and phase distortion have been studied, and
are called {\em time-phase} signal sets. Several constructions of time-phase
signal sets are available in the literature. There are a number of bounds on
time signal sets (also called codebooks). They are automatically bounds on
time-phase signal sets, but are bad bounds. The first objective of this paper
is to develop better bounds on time-phase signal sets from known bounds on time
signal sets. The second objective of this paper is to construct two series of
time-phase signal sets, one of which is optimal.

gossip) in dynamic networks. In gossip, or more generally, $k$-gossip, there
are $k$ pieces of information (or tokens) that are initially present in some
nodes and the problem is to disseminate the $k$ tokens to all nodes. The goal
is to accomplish the task in as few rounds of distributed computation as
possible. The problem is especially challenging in dynamic networks where the
network topology can change from round to round and can be controlled by an
on-line adversary.
  The focus of this paper is on the power of token-forwarding algorithms, which
do not manipulate tokens in any way other than storing and forwarding them. We
first consider a worst-case adversarial model first studied by Kuhn, Lynch, and
Oshman~\cite{kuhn+lo:dynamic} in which the communication links for each round
are chosen by an adversary, and nodes do not know who their neighbors for the
current round are before they broadcast their messages. Our main result is an
$\Omega(nk/\log n)$ lower bound on the number of rounds needed for any
deterministic token-forwarding algorithm to solve $k$-gossip. This resolves an
open problem raised in~\cite{kuhn+lo:dynamic}, improving their lower bound of
$\Omega(n \log k)$, and matching their upper bound of $O(nk)$ to within a
logarithmic factor.
  We next show that token-forwarding algorithms can achieve subquadratic time
in the offline version of the problem where the adversary has to commit all the
topology changes in advance at the beginning of the computation, and present
two polynomial-time offline token-forwarding algorithms. Our results are a step
towards understanding the power and limitation of token-forwarding algorithms
in dynamic networks.

low-dose CBCT, a clear understanding on the relationship between the image
quality and imaging dose at low dose levels is needed. In this paper, we
qualitatively investigate this subject in a comprehensive manner with extensive
experimental and simulation studies. The basic idea is to plot image quality
and imaging dose together as functions of number of projections and mAs per
projection over the whole clinically relevant range. A clear understanding on
the tradeoff between image quality and dose can be achieved and optimal
low-dose CBCT scan protocols can be developed for various imaging tasks in
IGRT. Main findings of this work include: 1) Under the CS framework, image
quality has little degradation over a large dose range, and the degradation
becomes evident when the dose < 100 total mAs. A dose < 40 total mAs leads to a
dramatic image degradation. Optimal low-dose CBCT scan protocols likely fall in
the dose range of 40-100 total mAs, depending on the specific IGRT
applications. 2) Among different scan protocols at a constant low-dose level,
the super sparse-view reconstruction with projection number less than 50 is the
most challenging case, even with strong regularization. Better image quality
can be acquired with other low mAs protocols. 3) The optimal scan protocol is
the combination of a medium number of projections and a medium level of
mAs/view. This is more evident when the dose is around 72.8 total mAs or below
and when the ROI is a low-contrast or high-resolution object. Based on our
results, the optimal number of projections is around 90 to 120. 4) The
clinically acceptable lowest dose level is task dependent. In our study,
72.8mAs is a safe dose level for visualizing low-contrast objects, while 12.2
total mAs is sufficient for detecting high-contrast objects of diameter greater
than 3 mm.

electric field are analyzed for different values of field strength, noise

procedure which keeps into account all the possible scattering phenomena of the
hot electrons in the medium and includes the evolution of spin polarization.
Spin depolarization is studied by examinating the decay of the initial spin
polarization of the conduction electrons through the D'yakonov-Perel process,
the only relevant relaxation mechanism in III-V crystals. Our results show
that, for electric field amplitude lower than the Gunn field, the dephasing
length shortens with the increasing of the noise intensity. Moreover, a
nonmonotonic behavior of spin depolarization length with the noise correlation
time is found, characterized by a maximum variation for values of noise
correlation time comparable with the dephasing time. Instead, in high field
conditions, we find that, critically depending on the noise correlation time,
external fluctuations can positively affect the relaxation length. The
influence of the inclusion of the electron-electron scattering mechanism is
also shown and discussed.

cylindrical samples have revealed an increase in heat transport with increasing
rotation rate. This heat transport enhancement is intimately related to a
transition in the turbulent flow structure from a regime dominated by a
large-scale circulation (LSC), consisting of a single convection roll, at no or
weak rotation to a regime dominated by vertically-aligned vortices at strong
rotation. For a sample with an aspect ratio \Gamma = D/L = 1 (D is the sample
diameter and L its height) the transition between the two regimes is indicated
by a strong decrease in the LSC strength. In contrast, for \Gamma = 1/2 Weiss
and Ahlers [J. Fluid Mech. {\bf{688}}, 461 (2011)] revealed the presence of a
LSC-like sidewall temperature signature beyond the critical rotation rate. They
suggested that this might be due to the formation of a two-vortex state, in
which one vortex extends vertically from the bottom into the sample interior
and brings up warm fluid, while another vortex brings down cold fluid from the
top; this flow field would yield a sidewall temperature signature similar to
that of the LSC. Here we show by direct numerical simulations for \Gamma= 1/2
and parameters that allow direct comparison with experiment that the spatial
organization of the vertically-aligned vortical structures in the convection
cell do indeed yield (for the time average) a sinusoidal variation of the
temperature near the sidewall, as found in the experiment. This is also the
essential and non-trivial difference with the \Gamma=1 sample, where the
vertically-aligned vortices are distributed randomly.

overlay. A mathematical analysis is provided to estimate the number of nodes
receiving the event, based on the network topology, the amount of subscribers
and the gossip probability. These outcomes are compared to those obtained via
simulation. Results show even when the amount of subscribers represents a very
small (yet non-negligible) portion of network nodes, by tuning the gossip
probability the event can percolate through the overlay. Hence, the use of
unstructured networks. coupled with simple dissemination protocols, represents
a viable approach to build peer-to-peer publish-subscribe applications.

have shown that there is a well-defined hierarchical structure and certain
specific individuals occupy more dominant positions --- suggesting that
leadership by the few individuals drives the behavior of the collective.
Conversely, by analyzing the same data-sets, we uncover a more egalitarian
mechanism. We show that both reciprocal relationships and a stratified
hierarchical leadership are important and necessary in the collective movements

The ""Kahn Principle"", which states that a network built from functional nodes
is the least fixpoint of a system of equations associated with the network, has
become a benchmark for the formal study of dataflow networks. We formulate a
generalized version of the Kahn Principle, which applies to a large class of
non-deterministic systems, in the setting of abstract asynchronous networks;
and prove that the Kahn Principle holds under certain natural assumptions on
the model. We also show that a class of models, which represent networks that
compute over arbitrary event structures, generalizing dataflow networks which
compute over streams, satisfy these assumptions.

to the age of the Universe, and it is believed that the abundances of most
chemical elements in their photospheres remain unchanged with time (those that
are not affected by the 1st dredge-up). This means that they trace the ISM in
the galaxy at the time the star formed, and hence the chemical enrichment
history of the galaxy. CMD analysis has shown the Carina dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) to have had an unusually episodic star formation history (SFH) which is
expected to be reflected in the abundances of different chemical elements. We
use the VLT-FLAMES spectrograph in HR mode (R~20000) to measure the abundances
of several chemical elements in a sample of 35 RGB stars in Carina. We also
combine these abundances with photometry to derive age estimates for these
stars. This allows us to determine which of two distinct star formation (SF)
episodes the stars in our sample belong to, and thus to define the relationship
between SF and chemical enrichment during these two episodes. As is expected
from the SFH, Carina contains two distinct populations of RGB stars: one old
(>10 Gyr), which we have found to be metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.5), and alpha-rich
([Mg/Fe]>0.0); the other intermediate age (~2-6 Gyr), which we have found to
have a metallicity range (-1.8<[Fe/H]<-1.2) with a large spread in [alpha/Fe]
abundance, going from extremely low values ([Mg/Fe]<-0.3) to the same mean
values as the older population (<[Mg/Fe]>~0.3). We show that the chemical
enrichment history of the Carina dSph was different for each SF episode. The
earliest was short (~2-3 Gyr) and resulted in the rapid chemical enrichment of
the whole galaxy to [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 with both SNe II and SNe Ia contributions.
The subsequent episode occured after a gap of ~3-4 Gyr and appears to have
resulted in relatively little evolution in either [Fe/H] or [alpha/Fe].

level of dust-correlated emission in the lowest WMAP bands is largely
unaffected by the choice of synchrotron template, particularly at high

detect the presence of a sinusoidal signal embedded in noise when standard
signal processing tools can be prohibitive. We show that the prescriptions for
the experimental set-up and some physical behaviors depend on the detection
strategy. More specifically, by exploiting the sample mean of escape times to
perform detection, two resonant regions are identified. At low frequencies
there is a stochastic resonance/activation phenomenon, while near the plasma
frequency a geometric resonance appears. The naive sample mean detector is
outperformed, in terms of error probability, by the optimal likelihood ratio
test. The latter exhibits only geometric resonance, showing monotonically
increasing performance as the bias current approaches the junction critical
current. In this regime the escape times are vanishingly small and therefore
performance are essentially limited by measurement electronics. The behavior of
the likelihood ratio and sample mean detector for different values of incoming
signal to noise ratio are discussed, and a relationship with the error
probability is found. The likelihood ratio test based detectors could be
employed also to estimate unknown parameters in the applied input signal. As a
prototypical example we study the phase estimation problem of a sinusoidal
current, that is accomplished by using the filter bank approach. Finally we
show that for a physically feasible detector the performances are found to be
very close to the Cramer- Rao theoretical bound. Applications might be found
for example in some astronomical detection problems or to analyze weak signals
in the sub-terahertz range.

zero, we formulate a constrained residual squared error minimization problem
that incorporates both the geometric information (i.e. the knowledge of the

IHT method that aims at solving this minimization problem and guarantees
monotonically non-increasing residual squared error for a given signal sparsity

extracting the convex hull of the inspected object from the measured sinograms;
the obtained convex hull is used to capture the object contour information. We
compare the proposed mask reconstruction schemes with the existing large-scale

heparin-binding growth factors from an affinity-based delivery system. In the
delivery system, heparin binds to a peptide which has been covalently
cross-linked to a fibrin matrix. Growth factor in turn binds to the heparin,
and growth factor release is governed by both binding and diffusion mechanisms,
the purpose of the binding being to slow growth factor release. The governing
mathematical model, which in its original formulation consists of five partial
differential equations, is reduced to a system of just two equations. We
identify the governing non-dimensional parameters that can be varied to tune
the growth factor release rate. In particular, we identify a parameter regime
that ensures slow passive release (usually desirable) of at least a fraction of
the growth factor. It is found that slow release is assured if the matrix is
prepared with the concentration of cross-linked peptide greatly exceeding the
dissociation constant of heparin from the peptide, and with the concentration
of heparin greatly exceeding the dissociation constant of the growth factor
from heparin. Also, for the first time, in vitro experimental release data is
directly compared with theoretical release profiles generated by the model. We
propose that the two stage release behaviour frequently seen in experiments is
due to an initial rapid out-diffusion of free growth factor over a diffusion
time scale (typically days), followed by a much slower release of the bound
fraction over a time scale depending on both diffusion and binding parameters
(frequently months).

molecular genetic factors are now known, the system level regulation of growth

is encountered in vitro in normally differentiating epithelial cell cultures
and is known as ""contact inhibition"". The study presented here provides a
quantitative characterization of contact inhibition dynamics on tissue-wide and
single cell levels. Using long-term tracking of cultured MDCK cells we
demonstrate that inhibition of cell division in a confluent monolayer follows
inhibition of cell motility and sets in when mechanical constraint on local
expansion causes divisions to reduce cell area. We quantify cell motility and
cell cycle statistics in the low density confluent regime and their change
across the transition to epithelial morphology which occurs with increasing
cell density. We then study the dynamics of cell area distribution arising
through reductive division, determine the average mitotic rate as a function of
cell size and demonstrate that complete arrest of mitosis occurs when cell area
falls below a critical value. We also present a simple computational model of
growth mechanics which captures all aspects of the observed behavior. Our
measurements and analysis show that contact inhibition is a consequence of
mechanical interaction and constraint rather than interfacial contact alone,

binaries from detached binaries when the primaries of the initially detached

investigate the formation and the short-period limit of contact binaries by
considering the effect of the instability of mass transfer. It is found that
with decreasing initial primary mass from 0.89M$_{\rm \odot}$ to 0.63M$_{\rm
\odot}$, the range of the initial mass ratio decreases for detached binaries
that experience stable mass transfer and evolve into contact. If the initial
primary mass is less than 0.63M$_{\rm \odot}$, detached binaries would
experience dynamically unstable mass transfer when the primaries of detached
binaries fill their Roche lobes. These systems would evolve into a common
envelope situation and probably then to a complete merger of two components on
a quite short timescale. This results in a low mass limit at about 0.63M$_{\rm
\odot}$ for the primary mass of contact binaries, which might be a main reason
why the period distribution of contact binaries has a short limit of about 0.22
days. By comparing the theoretical period distribution of contact binaries with
the observational data, it is found that the observed contact binaries are
above the low mass limit for the primary mass of contact binaries and no
observed contact binaries are below this limit. This suggests that the
short-period limit of contact binaries can be explained by the instability of
the mass transfer that occurs when the primaries of the initially detached

tetragonal FeSb2 phase, but its volume fraction is small at least up to 23.3

fitted to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state gave a bulk modulus = 74.2 +- 3.0
GPa and its pressure derivative = 7.5 +- 0.6. RS measurements were performed
from atmospheric pressure up to 45.2 GPa. For the orthorhombic FeSb2 phase, the
Raman active mode was observed up to the maximum pressure applied, while the
mode disappeared at 16.6 GPa. For pressures higher than 21 GPa, the Raman
active mode of a tetragonal FeSb2 phase was observed, confirming ab initio

two orders of magnitude higher than the low energy (synchrotron) one at 10^11

the high energy hump is modeled as inverse Compton emission between
relativistic electrons and seed photons produced externally to the jet, while
the synchrotron self-Compton component is found to be negligible. In our model
the observed variability can be accounted for by a variation of the total
number of emitting electrons, and by a dissipation region radius changing from

superconductivity is still missing. Considerable research efforts are currently
devoted to elucidating mechanisms by which pairs of electrons can bind together
through the mediation of a boson field different than the one associated to the
vibrations of a crystal lattice. PuCoGa_5, a 5f-electron heavy-fermion
superconductor with a record critical temperature T_c=18.5 K, is one of the
many compounds for which the short-range, isotropic attraction provided by
simple electron-phonon coupling does not appear as an adequate glue for
electron pairing. Here, we report the results of point-contact spectroscopy
measurements in single crystals of PuCoGa_5. Andreev reflection structures are
clearly observed in the low-temperature spectra, and unambiguously prove that
the paired superconducting electrons have wavefunction with the d-wave symmetry
of a four-leaf clover. A straightforward analysis of the spectra provide the
amplitude of the gap and its temperature dependence, \Delta(T). We obtain
\Delta(T -> 0) = 5.1 \pm 0.3 meV and a gap ratio, 2\Delta/k_B T_c = 6.5 \pm
0.3, indicating that the compound is in the regime of strong electron-boson
coupling. The gap value and its temperature dependence can be well reproduced
within the Eliashberg theory for superconductivity if the spectral function of
the mediating bosons has a spin-fluctuations-like shape, with a peak energy of
6.5 meV. Electronic structure calculations, combining the local density
approximation with an exact diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model,
provide a hint about the possible origin of the fluctuations.

Diskless stars are brighter in X-rays than disk-bearing stars, given the same

quantum systems comprising ultracold gas-phase atoms and substrate-bound

versatile and support quantum interactions with long coherence times.
Fulfilling these criteria is extremely challenging as it demands a stable and
tractable interface between two disparate regimes. Here we demonstrate an
architecture for atomic control based on domain walls (DWs) in planar magnetic
nanowires that provides a tunable atomic interaction, manifested experimentally
as the reflection of ultracold atoms from a nanowire array. We exploit the
magnetic reconfigurability of the nanowires to quickly and remotely tune the

practicability of more elaborate atom chips based on magnetic nanowires being
used to perform atom optics on the nanometre scale.

formation history from X-ray source population studies. It harbours a large
number of Be/X-ray binaries, and the supernova remnants can be easily resolved
with imaging X-ray instruments. We search for new supernova remnants in the SMC
and in particular for composite remnants with a central X-ray source. We study
the morphology of newly found candidate supernova remnants using radio, optical
and X-ray images and investigate their X-ray spectra. Here we report on the
discovery of the new supernova remnant around the recently discovered Be/X-ray
binary pulsar SXP 1062 in radio and X-ray images. The Be/X-ray binary system is
found near the centre of the supernova remnant, which is located at the outer
edge of the eastern wing of the SMC. The remnant is oxygen-rich, indicating
that it developed from a type Ib event. From XMM-Newton observations we find
that the neutron star with a spin period of 1062 s shows a very high average
spin-down rate of 0.26 s per day over the observing period of 18 days. From the
currently accepted models, our estimated age of around 10000-25000 years for
the supernova remnant is not long enough to spin down the neutron star from a
few 10 ms to its current value. Assuming an upper limit of 25000 years for the
age of the neutron star and the extreme case that the neutron star was spun
down by the accretion torque that we have measured during the XMM-Newton
observations since its birth, a lower limit of 0.5 s for the birth spin period
is inferred. For more realistic, smaller long-term average accretion torques
our results suggest that the neutron star was born with a correspondingly
longer spin period. This implies that neutron stars in Be/X-ray binaries with
long spin periods can be much younger than currently anticipated.

electromagnetic interactions on small scales, we know very little about the
behaviour of electromagnetic fields on cosmological distances. Thus, it has
been suggested recently that the problems of dark energy and the origin of
cosmic magnetic fields could be pointing to a modification of Maxwell's theory
on large scales. Here, we review such a proposal in which the scalar state
which is usually eliminated be means of the Lorenz condition is allowed to
propagate. On super-Hubble scales, the new mode is essentially given by the
temporal component of the electromagnetic potential and contributes as an
effective cosmological constant to the energy-momentum tensor. The new state
can be generated from quantum fluctuations during inflation and it is shown
that the predicted value for the cosmological constant agrees with observations
provided inflation took place at the electroweak scale. We also consider more
general theories including non-minimal couplings to the space-time curvature in
the presence of the temporal electromagnetic background. We show that both in
the minimal and non-minimal cases, the modified Maxwell's equations include new
effective current terms which can generate magnetic fields from sub-galactic
scales up to the present Hubble horizon. The corresponding amplitudes could be
enough to seed a galactic dynamo or even to account for observations just by
collapse and differential rotation in the protogalactic cloud.

meson systems. Such phases are related to the parameter $z$ describing the
$CPT$ violation; moreover, a non zero phase difference between particle and
antiparticle arises only in presence of $CPT$ symmetry breaking. Thus, a
completely new test for the $CPT$ invariance can be provided by the study of
such phases in mixed mesons. Systems which are particularly interesting for
such an analysis are the $B_{s}^{0}-\bar{B}_{s}^{0}$ and the
$K^{0}-\bar{K}^{0}$ ones. In order to introduce non-cyclic phases, some aspects
of the formalism describing the mixed neutral mesons are analyzed. Since the
effective Hamiltonian of systems like $K^{0}-\bar{K}^{0}$, $B^{0}-\bar{B}^{0}$,
$B_{s}^{0}-\bar{B}_{s}^{0}$, $D^{0}-\bar{D}^{0}$ is non-Hermitian and

of Regge's trajectories is invalidated by an integration of the energy and

the absurd result that ""total"" angular momentum decreases as the frequency
increases. The correct expression for the angular momentum is obtained from
hyperbolic geometry of constant negative curvature $r_0$. When the square of
the relativistic mass is introduced, it gives a negative intercept which is the
Euclidean value of the angular momentum. Regge trajectories are simply
statements of the conservation of angular momentum in hyperbolic space. The
