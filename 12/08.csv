metallic antiferromagnet Fe50Mn50 has been studied as a function of ferromagnet
thickness and buffer layer material. Mu-metal exhibits classic exchange bias
behavior: the exchange bias (HEB) and coercive fields scale inversely with the
ferromagnet's thickness, with HEB varying as the cosine of the in-plane applied
field angle. While the exchange bias, coercivity, and exchange energy are
greatest when the buffer layer material is (111) oriented Cu, amorphous Ta
buffers allow the mu-metal to retain more of its soft magnetic character. The
ability to preserve soft ferromagnetic behavior in an exchange biased
heterostructure may be useful for low field sensing and other device
applications.

the AGK3 were monitored with the CORAVEL spectrovelocimeter, in order to
prepare a sample of physical binaries with very wide separations. Sixty-six
stars received special attention, since their RV seemed to be variable. These
stars were monitored over several years in order to derive the elements of
their spectroscopic orbits. In addition, 10 of them received accurate RV
measurements from the SOPHIE spectrograph of the T193 telescope at the
Observatory of Haute-Provence.
  For deriving the orbital elements of double-lined spectroscopic binaries
(SB2), a new method was applied, which assumed that the RV of blended
measurements are linear combinations of the RV of the components. Thirteen SB2
orbits were thus calculated.
  The orbital elements were eventually obtained for 52 spectroscopic binaries
(SB), two of them making a triple system. Forty SB received their first orbit,
and the orbital elements were improved for 10 others. In addition, 11
spectroscopic binaries were discovered with very long periods for which the
orbital parameters were not found. The median period of the 40 first orbits is
1 year, and several SB should be resolved or should receive an astrometric
orbit in the future, providing the masses of the components. In addition, it
appeared that HD 153252 has a close companion which is a candidate brown dwarf
with a minimum mass of 50 Jupiter masses.

focus is placed on the critical evaluation of the spin-triplet, odd-parity
pairing scenario applied to Sr2RuO4. After an introduction to superconductors
with possible odd-parity pairing, accumulated evidence for the pairing symmetry
of Sr2RuO4 is examined. Then, significant recent progress on the theoretical
approaches to the superconducting pairing by Coulomb repulsion is reviewed. A
section is devoted to some experimental properties of Sr2RuO4 that seem to defy
simple explanations in terms of currently available spin-triplet scenario. The
next section deals with some new developments using eutectic boundaries and
micro-crystals, which reveals novel superconducting phenomena related to chiral
edge states, odd-frequency pairing states, and half-fluxoid states. Some of
these properties are intimately connected with the properties as a topological
superconductor. The article concludes with a summary of knowledge emerged from
the study of Sr2RuO4 that are now more widely applied to understand the physics
of other unconventional superconductors, as well as with a brief discussion of
relatively unexplored but promising areas of ongoing and future studies of

  SPM-based Investigation of the Role of Molecular Entanglement","21 pages, 6 fifures, 3 tables, submitted",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The viscoelastic properties of thin polymeric films represent a central
issue, especially for nanotechnological applications. In particular, it is
highly relevant the dependence of viscoelasticity on the temperature. For
polystyrene it is known that the glass transition temperature is dependent on
the film thickness. At present, there is wide agreement on the importance of
the two interfaces that the films form with the air and with the substrate. The
relevance of molecular entanglement has been also stressed for the case of
suspended films. However, the role of molecular entanglement on the glass
transition temperature of supported films still remains elusive. In order to
investigate the viscoelastic properties of thin films on the nanoscale, we have
employed a scanning probe microscope suitably modified in order to monitor the
indentation of a tip into a polymeric film during a given lapse of time with
the application of a constant load. Thin polystyrene films have been prepared
on a range of different substrates: native silicon oxide, hydrogen-terminated
silicon and polystyrene brushes. In particular, we have considered polystyrene
molecules with molecular weight values below and above the critical value for
the occurrence of molecular entanglement. We find that, for samples where
molecular entanglement can occur accompanied by a strong interaction with the
substrate either by means of chemical bonds or physisorption, the glass
transition temperature of thin films increases back to values comparable with
those of thick films. This phenomenon is envisioned to be of great relevance in
those cases where one needs to improve the adhesion and/or to control the
viscoelastic properties of thin films.

a transiting planet candidate orbiting the 11th magnitude G5 dwarf KIC 10593626
with a period of 290 days. The characteristics of the host star are well
constrained by high-resolution spectroscopy combined with an asteroseismic
analysis of the Kepler photometry, leading to an estimated mass and radius of
0.970 +/- 0.060 MSun and 0.979 +/- 0.020 RSun. The depth of 492 +/- 10ppm for
the three observed transits yields a radius of 2.38 +/- 0.13 REarth for the
planet. The system passes a battery of tests for false positives, including
reconnaissance spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and centroid motion. A
full BLENDER analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretation
by showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarely
mimic the observed shape of the transits. The final validation of the planet is
provided by 16 radial velocities obtained with HIRES on Keck 1 over a one year
span. Although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and mass
determination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{\sigma} upper limit
of 124 MEarth, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning the
designation Kepler-22b. The radiative equilibrium temperature is 262K for a
planet in Kepler-22b's orbit. Although there is no evidence that Kepler-22b is
a rocky planet, it is the first confirmed planet with a measured radius to

The compound consists of ferrimagnetic (1,1/2) chains coupled by two sorts of
antiferromagnetic interactions. Whereas a behavior of the magnetization curve
in higher magnetic fields can be understood within a process for the separate
ferrimagnetic chain, an appearance of the singlet plateau at lower fields is an
example of non-Lieb-Mattis type ferrimagnetism. By using the exact
diagonalization technique for a finite clusters of sizes 4x8 and 4x10 we show
that the interchain frustration coupling plays an essential role in
stabilization of the singlet phase. These results are complemented by an
analysis of four cylindrically coupled ferrimagnetic (1,1/2) chains via an
abelian bosonization technique and an effective theory based on the XXZ
spin-1/2 Heisenberg model when the interchain interactions are sufficiently
weak/strong, respectively.

a constant optical absorption coefficient, while the infrared coefficient can
scale as a powerlaw with pressure. Here we describe our new code in detail and

our use of the diffusion approximation for radiative fluxes at high optical

drag on the atmosphere. We calculate emitted thermal phase curves and find that
our drag-free model has the brightest region of the atmosphere offset by ~12
degrees from the substellar point and a minimum flux that is 17% of the
maximum, while the model with the strongest magnetic drag has an offset of only
~2 degrees and a ratio of 13%. Finally, we calculate rates of numerical loss of

there is no measurable loss; we speculate that this is due to the much

predictive modeling of outcomes in a live clinical setting. Implementation
factors were also addressed within the framework of the Theory of Planned
Behavior by linking adoption rates to implementation practices and clinician
perceptions. The results showed that the CDOI does contain significant capacity
to predict outcome delta over time based on baseline and early change scores in
a large, real-world clinical setting, as suggested in previous research. The
implementation analysis revealed a number of critical factors affecting
successful implementation and adoption of the CDOI outcome measure, though
there was a notable disconnect between clinician intentions and actual
behavior. Most importantly, the predictive capacity of the CDOI underscores the
utility of direct client feedback measures such as PROs and their potential use
as the basis for next generation clinical decision support tools and
personalized treatment approaches.

TIP-II in a spectral range which comprises the chromospheric He I 10830 A

formed before our observing run) was detected in the He I absorption images on
2005 July 3rd. The chromospheric vector magnetic field in this portion of the
filament was strongly sheared whereas the photospheric field lines underneath
had an inverse polarity configuration. From July 3rd to July 5th, an opening
and closing of the polarities at either side of the polarity inversion line
(PIL) was recorded, resembling the recently discovered process of the sliding
door effect seen by Hinode. During this time, a newly created region that
contained pores and orphan penumbrae at the PIL was observed.On July 5th, a
normal polarity configuration was inferred from the chromospheric spectra,
while strongly sheared field lines aligned with the PIL were found in the
photosphere. In this same data set, the spine of the filament is also observed
in a different portion of the FOV and is clearly mapped by the Silicon line
core. The inferred vector magnetic fields of the filament suggest a flux rope
topology. Furthermore, the observations indicate that the filament is divided
in two parts, one which lies in the chromosphere and another one that stays
trapped in the photosphere. Therefore, only the top of the helical structure is
seen by the Helium lines. The pores and orphan penumbrae at the PIL appear to
be the photospheric counterpart of the extremely low-lying filament. We suggest
that orphan penumbrae are formed in very narrow PILs of compact ARs and are the
photospheric manifestation of flux ropes in the photosphere.

stochastic model of a finite metapopulation. We suggest a new approach, using
the number of patches in the population as a large parameter. This approach
does not require that the number of individuals per patch is large, neither is
it necessary to assume a time-scale separation between local population
dynamics and migration. Our approach makes it possible to accurately describe
the dynamics of metapopulations consisting of many small patches. We focus on
metapopulations on the brink of extinction. We estimate the time to extinction
and describe the most likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of
the time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors, a vector
characterising the distribution of patch population sizes in the quasi-steady
state, and a vector -- related to Fisher's reproduction vector -- that
quantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state distribution to
demographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical results to stochastic
simulations of the model, and discuss the range of validity of the analytical
expressions. By identifying fast and slow degrees of freedom in the
metapopulation dynamics, we show that the dynamics of large metapopulations
close to extinction is approximately described by a deterministic equation
originally proposed by Levins (1969). We were able to compute the rates in
Levins' equation in terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based
model. It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable
depends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of the
patches. Only when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are large does the
slow variable correspond to the number of patches, as envisaged by Levins. Last
but not least, we discuss how our findings relate to other, widely used
metapopulation models.

should be expressed formally, while others are not of that opinion. The digital

review shows that while there may be ways to identify the technical makeup or
general characteristics of a digital object, there is currently no formal and

significant properties of the objects are. This review thus helps open
questions and generates a formative recommendation based on expert opinion that
expressing an object's functions in an explicit and formal way (using didactic
guides from the archives community) could be the solution to help stakeholders
decide what characteristics/ elements exactly we should preserve.

entanglement entropy in the early universe before the matter dominant era. This
is made possible by invoking the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which
has the advantage of preserving unitarity and providing a smooth transition
between the inflation epoch and the radiation dominant era. The dynamics of the
universe is described by the quantization in the minisuperspace of the GCG
model, following the prescription proposed by Wheeler and DeWitt. Two sources
of contribution to the cosmic entanglement entropy are considered: one from the
homogeneous background where the observable and the unobservable regions of the
universe are entangled and the other from the inhomogeneous cosmological
perturbations where different modes are entangled. We find that the homogeneous
contribution grows exponentially at the very beginning of the inflation, but
decreases during the radiation dominant era. Conversely, that from the
cosmological perturbation is found to decrease at first and then increase after
reaching a minimum value. The net result is that the total entanglement entropy
reaches a minimum at an early stage of the inflation and then increases
throughout most of the inflation and the entire radiation dominant era.

distribution of clumpy dust. We fit our models to Hubble Space Telescope images
corresponding to the B and I bands, using shapelet analysis and a genetic
algorithm to generate 30 statistically best-fitting models. These models have a
strong preference for spirality and clumpiness, with average face-on
attenuation decreasing from 0.24(0.16) to 0.03(0.03) mag in the B(I) band
between 0.5 and 2 radial scale-lengths. Most of the attenuation comes from
small high-density clumps with low (<10%) filling factors. The fraction of dust
in clumps is broadly consistent with results from fitting NGC 891's spectral
energy distribution. Because of scattering effects and the intermixed nature of
the dust and starlight, attenuation is smaller and less wavelength-dependent
than the integrated dust column-density. Our clumpy models typically have
higher attenuation at low inclinations than previous radiative transfer models
using smooth distributions of stars and dust, but similar attenuation at
inclinations above 70 degrees. At all inclinations most clumpy models have less
attenuation than expected from previous estimates based on minimizing scatter
in the Tully-Fisher relation. Mass-to-light ratios are higher and the intrinsic
scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation is larger than previously expected for
galaxies similar to NGC 891. The attenuation curve changes as a function of
inclination, with R_(B,B-I)=A_(B)/E(B-I) increasing by ~0.75 from face-on to

velocities and Hipparcos parallaxes we calculate a lower limit on the kinematic
expansion age for Upper Sco of >10.5 Myr (99% confidence). However, the data
are statistically consistent with no expansion. We reevaluate the inferred

observations of resolved halo stars or through surface photometry. Curiously,
the two methods appear to give conflicting results, as a number of surface
photometry measurements have revealed integrated colours that are too red to be
reconciled with the halo properties inferred from the study of resolved stars.
Several explanations for this anomaly have been proposed - including dust
photoluminescence, extinction of extragalactic background light and a
bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function. A decisive test is, however, still
lacking. Here, we explain how observations of the halo of a nearby galaxy,
involving a combination of both surface photometry and bright star counts, can
be used to distinguish between the proposed explanations. We derive the
observational requirements for this endeavour and find that star counts in
filters VI and surface photometry in filters VIJ appears to be the optimal
strategy. Since the required halo star counts are already available for many
nearby galaxies, the most challenging part of this test is likely to be the
optical surface photometry, which requires several nights of exposure time on a
4-8 m telescope, and the near-IR surface photometry, which is most readily
carried out using the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

part of a long-term program to monitor the expansion and energy scale of the
relativistic outflow, and to trace the parsec-scale environment around a
previously-dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH). The new observations reveal
a significant change in the radio evolution starting at \sim1 month, with a
brightening at all frequencies that requires an increase in the energy by about
an order of magnitude, and an overall density profile around the SMBH of rho
\propto r^{-3/2} (0.1-1.2 pc) with a significant flattening at r\sim0.4-0.6 pc.
The increase in energy cannot be explained with continuous injection from an L
\propto t^{-5/3} tail, which is observed in the X-rays. Instead, we conclude
that the relativistic jet was launched with a wide range of Lorentz factors,
obeying E(>Gamma) \propto Gamma^{-2.5}. The similar ratio of duration to
dynamical timescale for Sw1644+57 and GRBs suggests that this result may be
applicable to GRBs as well. The radial density profile may be indicative of
Bondi accretion, with the inferred flattening at r\sim0.5 pc in good agreement
with the Bondi radius for a \sim10^6 M_sun black hole. The density at \sim0.5
pc is about a factor of 30 times lower than inferred for the Milky Way galactic
center, potentially due to a smaller number of mass-shedding massive stars.
From our latest observations (\sim216 d) we find that the jet energy is
E_{iso}\sim5x10^{53} erg (E_j\sim2.4x10^{51} erg for theta_j=0.1), the radius
is r\sim1.2 pc, the Lorentz factor is Gamma\sim2.2, the ambient density is
n\sim0.2 cm^{-3}, and the projected size is r_{proj}\sim25 microarcsec.
Assuming no future changes in the observed evolution we predict that the radio
emission from Sw1644+57 should be detectable with the EVLA for several decades,
and will be resolvable with VLBI in a few years.

In a Cosmological Context (MAGICC) program in which the stellar feedback is
tuned to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For comparison, each
galaxy was also simulated using a 'lower feedback' (LF) model which has
strength comparable to other implementations in the literature. The 'MAGICC
feedback' (MF) model has a higher incidence of massive stars and an
approximately two times higher energy input per supernova. Apart from the
low-mass halo using LF, each galaxy exhibits a metal-enriched CGM that extends
to approximately the virial radius. A significant fraction of this gas has been
heated in supernova explosions in the disc and subsequently ejected into the
CGM where it is predicted to give rise to substantial O VI absorption. The
simulations do not yet address the question of what happens to the O VI when
the galaxies stop forming stars. Our models also predict a reservoir of cool H
I clouds that show strong Ly\alpha absorption to several hundred kpc. Comparing
these models to recent surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope, we find that
only the MF models have sufficient O VI and H I gas in the CGM to reproduce the
observed distributions. In separate analyses, these same MF models also show
better agreement with other galaxy observables (e.g. rotation curves, surface
brightness profiles and H I gas distribution). We infer that the CGM is the

are compact, with periods between 0.35 and 0.45 days and semimajor axes of
approximately 2 solar radii (0.01 AU). We use the Robo-AO laser guide star
adaptive optics system to tentatively identify one of the objects as a triple

dwarf radius of 0.025 solar radii (95% confidence) in one of the systems. We

are highly parallelized and manage memory efficiently. As compute engines grow
larger, AMR simulations will require algorithms that achieve new levels of
efficient parallelization and memory management. We have attempted to employ
new techniques to achieve both of these goals. Patch or grid based AMR often
employs ghost cells to decouple the hyperbolic advances of each grid on a given
refinement level. This decoupling allows each grid to be advanced
independently. In AstroBEAR we utilize this independence by threading the grid
advances on each level with preference going to the finer level grids. This
allows for global load balancing instead of level by level load balancing and
allows for greater parallelization across both physical space and AMR level.
Threading of level advances can also improve performance by interleaving
communication with computation, especially in deep simulations with many levels
of refinement. While we see improvements of up to 30% on deep simulations run
on a few cores, the speedup is typically more modest (5-20%) for larger scale
simulations. To improve memory management we have employed a distributed tree
algorithm that requires processors to only store and communicate local sections
of the AMR tree structure with neighboring processors. Using this distributed
approach we are able to get reasonable scaling efficiency (> 80%) out to 12288
cores and up to 8 levels of AMR - independent of the use of threading.

exterior spacetime of compact stars remains still an interesting open question
in Relativistic Astrophysics. As an attempt to establish their level of
accuracy, the radii of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbits (ISCOs) of test
particles given by analytic exterior spacetime geometries have been compared
with the ones given by numerical solutions for neutron stars (NSs) obeying a
realistic equation of state (EoS). It has been so shown that the six-parametric

accurate to describe the NS ISCO radii than other analytic models. We propose
here an additional test of accuracy for analytic exterior geometries based on
the comparison of orbital frequencies of neutral test particles. We compute the
Keplerian, frame-dragging, as well as the precession and oscillation
frequencies of the radial and vertical motions of neutral test particles for
the Kerr and PRS geometries; then we compare them with the numerical values
obtained by Morsink and Stella (1999) for realistic NSs. We identify the role
of high-order multipole moments such as the mass quadrupole and current
octupole in the determination of the orbital frequencies especially in the
rapid rotation regime. The results of this work are relevant to cast a

Bounds for general graphs based on known graph parameters are given, as is a
formula for the minimum universal rank for regular graphs based on the
multiplicity of the eigenvalues of $A$. The exact value of the minimum
universal rank of some families of graphs are determined, including complete

notion of equilibrium, namely the satisfaction form (SF) and the satisfaction

interested in the satisfaction of some individual performance constraints,
instead of individual performance optimization. Under this formulation, the
notion of equilibrium corresponds to the situation where all players can
simultaneously satisfy their individual constraints. The notion of SE, models
the problem of QoS provisioning in decentralized self-configuring networks.
Here, radio devices are satisfied if they are able to provide the requested
QoS. Within this framework, the concept of SE is formalized for both pure and
mixed strategies considering finite sets of players and actions. In both cases,
sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the SE are presented.
When multiple SE exist, we introduce the idea of effort or cost of satisfaction
and we propose a refinement of the SE, namely the efficient SE (ESE). At the
ESE, all players adopt the action which requires the lowest effort for
satisfaction. A learning method that allows radio devices to achieve a SE in
pure strategies in finite time and requiring only one-bit feedback is also
presented. Finally, a power control game in the interference channel is used to
highlight the advantages of modeling QoS problems following the notion of SE
rather than other equilibrium concepts, e.g., generalized Nash equilibrium.

of molecular hydrogen, X_CO, is crucial in studying the gaseous content of
galaxies, its evolution, and relation to star formation. In most cases the
conversion factor is assumed to be close to that of giant molecular clouds
(GMCs) in the Milky Way, except possibly for mergers and star-bursting
galaxies. However, there are physical grounds to expect that it should also
depend on the gas metallicity, surface density, and strength of the
interstellar radiation field. The XCO factor may also depend on the scale on
which CO emission is averaged due to effects of limited resolution. We study
the dependence of X_CO on gas properties and averaging scale using a model that
is based on a combination of results of sub-pc scale magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations and on the gas distribution from self-consistent cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation. Our model predicts a value of X_CO that is
consistent with the Galactic value for interstellar medium conditions typical
for the Milky Way. For such conditions the predicted X_CO varies by only a
factor of two for gas surfaced densities in the range \sim 50 - 500 M_sun /
pc^2. However, the model also predicts that more generally on the scale of
GMCs, X_CO is a strong function of metallicity, and depends on the column
density and the interstellar UV flux. We show explicitly that neglecting these
dependencies in observational estimates can strongly bias the inferred
distribution of H2 column densities of molecular clouds to have a narrower and
offset range compared to the true distribution. We find that when averaged on
\sim kpc scales the X-factor depends only weakly on radiation field and column
density, but is still a strong function of metallicity. The predicted
metallicity dependence can be approximated as X_CO \sim Z^{-{\gamma}} with
{\gamma} ~ 0.5 - 0.8.

influence with whom they interact. First, we investigate the details of how the
feedback from the behavior of agents determines the emergence of cooperation
and hierarchical contact structures. We also study the stability of the system
to different types of noise, and find that different regions of parameter space
show very different response. Some types of noise can destroy an all-cooperator
state. If, on the other hand, hubs are stable, then so is the all-C state.
Finally, we investigate the dependence of the ratio between the timescales of
strategy updates and the evolution of the interaction structure. We find that a
comparatively fast strategy dynamics is a prerequisite for the emergence of

equations, in an abstract framework. We show that semigroups $T_t$ in Banach

extended space $E$, which is obtained by considering a sequence of wider Banach
spaces containing $X$, i.e. $X$$/subset$$X_t$$/subset$$X_s$... $(t<s)$, under
the following two conditions. One is the density assumption on a subset $D$ of
$X$, the set of initial values $x$ from which $T_{-t}x$ exists for all $t>0$.
Another is the backward uniqueness of the semigroup $T_t$. For example, we
prove the holomorphic semigroup satisfies the above conditions, and thus is
extendable to a group in a larger functional space $E$. We also studied
structual properties of the extended space $E$.

E, in press",,,,"nlin.PS physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze the formation of one-dimensional localized patterns in a nonlinear
dissipative medium including a set of two narrow ""hot spots"" (HSs), which carry
the linear gain, local potential, cubic self-interaction, and cubic loss, while
the linear loss acts in the host medium. This system can be realized, as a
spatial-domain one, in optics, and also in Bose-Einstein condensates of
quasi-particles in solid-state settings. Recently, exact solutions were found
for localized modes pinned to the single HS represented by the delta-function.
The present paper reports analytical and numerical solutions for coexisting
two- and multi-peak modes, which may be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect
to the underlying HS pair. Stability of the modes is explored through
simulations of their perturbed evolution. The sign of the cubic nonlinearity
plays a crucial role: in the case of the self-focusing, only the fundamental
symmetric and antisymmetric modes, with two local peaks tacked to the HSs, and
no additional peaks between them, may be stable. In this case, all the
higher-order multi-peak modes, being unstable, evolve into the fundamental
ones. Stability regions for the fundamental modes are reported. A more
interesting situation is found in the case of the self-defocusing cubic
nonlinearity, with the HS pair giving rise to a multi-stability, with up to
eight coexisting stable multi-peak patterns, symmetric and antisymmetric ones.
The system without the self-interaction, the nonlinearity 2 being represented
only by the local cubic loss, is investigated too. This case is similar to
those with the self-focusing or defocusing nonlinearity, if the linear
potential of the HS is, respectively, attractive or repulsive. An additional
feature of the former setting is the coexistence of the stable fundamental
modes with robust breathers.

over hundreds of observing nights in the next five years. Along with
diffraction-limited coronagraphs and high-order adaptive optics, these
instruments also will return spectral and polarimetric information on any
discovered targets, giving clues to their atmospheric compositions and
characteristics. Such spectral characterization will be key to forming a
detailed theory of comparative exoplanetary science which will be widely
applicable to both exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Further, the prevalence of
aperture masking interferometry in the field of high contrast imaging is also
allowing observers to sense massive, young planets at solar system scales
(~3-30 AU)---separations out of reach to conventional direct imaging
techniques. Such observations can provide snapshots at the earliest phases of
planet formation---information essential for constraining formation mechanisms
as well as evolutionary models of planetary mass companions. As a demonstration
of the power of this technique, I briefly review recent aperture masking
observations of the HR 8799 system. Moreover, all of the aforementioned
techniques are already extremely adept at detecting low-mass stellar companions
to their target stars, and I present some recent highlights.

model configuration of the Cadarache von-K\'arm\'an-Sodium dynamo experiment.
The effect of a localized axisymmetric distribution of relative permeability
{\mu} that represents soft iron material within the conducting fluid flow is
investigated. The critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm^c for dynamo action of
the first non-axisymmetric mode roughly scales like
Rm^c({\mu})-Rm^c({\mu}->infinity) ~ {\mu}^(-1/2) i.e. the threshold decreases
as {\mu} increases. This scaling law suggests a skin effect mechanism in the
soft iron disks. More important with regard to the Cadarache dynamo experiment,
we observe a purely toroidal axisymmetric mode localized in the high
permeability disks which becomes dominant for large {\mu}. In this limit, the
toroidal mode is close to the onset of dynamo action with a (negative)
growth-rate that is rather independent of the magnetic Reynolds number. We
qualitatively explain this effect by paramagnetic pumping at the fluid/disk
interface and propose a simplified model that quantitatively reproduces
numerical results. The crucial role of the high permeability disks for the mode
selection in the Cadarache dynamo experiment cannot be inferred from
computations using idealized pseudo-vacuum boundary conditions (H x n = 0).

their radiation is beamed towards the Earth. Compact stellar binary mergers are
possible central engines of short GRBs and their rate could be boosted in
globular clusters. Globular cluster typically follow well defined orbits around
the galactic center. Therefore their position relative to the solar system can
be calculated back in time. This fact is used to demonstrate that globular
cluster - solar system encounters define possible points in time when a nearby
GRB could have exploded. Additionally, potential terrestrial signatures in the
geological record connected to such an event are discussed. Assuming rates of
GRBs launched in globular cluster found from the redshift distribution of short
burst and adopting the current globular cluster space-density around the solar
system it is found that the expected minimal distance d_min for such a GRB in
the last Gyr is in the range d_min ~ 1 - 3.5 kpc. From the average gamma-ray
luminosity of a short GRB significant depletion of the terrestrial ozone-layer
is expected if such an event explodes at a distance of ~1 kpc. In the last Gyr
a few globular cluster passages are expected within a distance of d_min from
the solar system and a GRB should have exploded during one of these passages.
Globular cluster - solar system encounters and events of mass extinction in the
history of life can be correlated to investigate the impact of a nearby GRB on
the terrestrial biota. To explore such a correlation reliable globular cluster
positions relative to the solar system have to be calculated for the time span

Moreover, at points of shock wave interaction, delta function sources exist in
the second derivatives of the gravitational metric tensor in all coordinate

processing. Recently, convex relaxation methods for image multi-labeling were
proposed in the literature. Often these models involve the total variation (TV)
semi-norm as regularizing term. However, it is well-known that the TV
functional is not optimal for the segmentation of textured regions. In recent
years directional representation systems were proposed to cope with curved
singularities in images. In particular, curvelets and shearlets provide an
optimally sparse approximation in the class of piecewise smooth functions with
$C^2$ singularity boundaries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the discrete
shearlet transform is suited as regularizer for the segmentation of curved
structures. Neither the shearlet nor the curvelet transform where used as
regularizer in a segmentation model so far. To this end, we have implemented a
translation invariant finite discrete shearlet transform based on the FFT. We
describe how the shearlet transform can be incorporated within the multi-label
segmentation model and show how to find a minimizer of the corresponding
functional by applying an alternating direction method of multipliers. Here the
Parseval frame property of our shearlets comes into play. We demonstrate by
numerical examples that the shearlet regularized model can better segment
curved textures than the TV regularized one and that the method can also cope
with regularizers obtained from non-local means.

until it first returns to zero, $B$. Encompassing non-i.i.d. increments, the
large-deviations asymptotics of $B$ is addressed, under the assumption that the
increments satisfy standard conditions, including a negative drift. The main
conclusions provide insight on the probability of a large busy period, and the
manner in which this occurs:
  I) The scaled probability of a large busy period has the asymptote, for any
$b>0$, \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \log P(B\geq bn) = -K\sqrt{b},
\hbox{where} \quad K = 2 \sqrt{-\int_0^{\lambda^*} \Lambda(\theta) d\theta},
\quad \hbox{with $\lambda^*=\sup\{\theta:\Lambda(\theta)\leq0\}$,} and with
$\Lambda$ denoting the scaled cumulant generating function of the increments
process.
  II) The most likely path to a large swept area is found to be a simple
rescaling of the path on $[0,1]$ given by, [\psi^*(t) =
-\Lambda(\lambda^*(1-t))/\lambda^*.] In contrast to the piecewise linear most
likely path leading the random walk to hit a high level, this is strictly
concave in general. While these two most likely paths have very different
forms, their derivatives coincide at the start of their trajectories, and at
their first return to zero.
  These results partially answer an open problem of Kulick and Palmowski
regarding the tail of the work done during a busy period at a single server
queue. The paper concludes with applications of these results to the estimation
of the busy period statistics $(\lambda^*, K)$ based on observations of the
increments, offering the possibility of estimating the likelihood of a large
busy period in advance of observing one.

anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the most important of
which is the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Observational efforts
with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT)
are poised to detect this signal for the first time. Indeed, recent SPT
measurements place a bound on the dimensionless kSZ power spectrum around a
multipole of l=3000 of P_tot < 2.8 (6) micro K^2 at 95% C.L., by ignoring
(allowing) correlations between the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and
the cosmic infrared background (CIB). To interpret these and upcoming
observations, we compute the kSZ signal from a suite of ~ 100 reionization
models using the publicly available code 21cmFAST. Our physically motivated
reionization models are parameterized by the ionizing efficiency of
high-redshift galaxies, the minimum virial temperature of halos capable of
hosting stars, and the ionizing photon mean free path. We predict the
contribution of patchy reionization to be P_patchy = 1.5-3.5 micro K^2.
Therefore, even when conservatively adopting a low estimate of the
post-reionization signal, P_OV ~ 2 micro K^2, none of our models are consistent
with the aggressive 2sigma SPT bound that does not include correlations. This
implies that either: (i) the early stages of reionization occurred in a much
more homogeneous manner than suggested by the stellar-driven scenarios we
explore, such as would be the case if, e.g., very high energy X-rays or exotic
particles contributed significantly; and/or (ii) that there is a significant
correlation between the CIB and the tSZ. On the other hand, the conservative
SPT bound is compatible with all of our models, and is on the boarder of
constraining reionization.

such as to minimize the expected distance between two points x and y chosen
uniformly at random from S. By distance we mean the length of the shortest path
between x and y along edges of T. The length of a path is the sum of the
weights of its edges. Edge weights are assumed to be given as part of the
problem for every pair of distinct points (x,y) in S^2.

polygon and we look for a triangulation of the interior of the polygon that is
optimal in the same sense.
  We prove that a general formulation of the problem in which the weights are
arbitrary positive numbers is strongly NP-complete. For the case when all the
weights are equal we give polynomial-time algorithms. In the end we mention
several open problems.

lead to the emergence of the seeds of cosmic structure. The proposal leads to a
deviation of the primordial spectrum from the scale-invariant

We perform statistical analyses to test two quantum collapse schemes with
recent data from the CMB, including the 7-yr release of WMAP and the matter
power spectrum measured using LRGs by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Results
from the statistical analyses indicate that several collapse models are

  Approach","19 pages",,,,"cs.SI cs.DS physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A ""community"" in a social network is usually understood to be a group of
nodes more densely connected with each other than with the rest of the network.
This is an important concept in most domains where networks arise: social,
technological, biological, etc. For many years algorithms for finding
communities implicitly assumed communities are nonoverlapping (leading to use
of clustering-based approaches) but there is increasing interest in finding
overlapping communities. A barrier to finding communities is that the solution
concept is often defined in terms of an NP-complete problem such as Clique or
Hierarchical Clustering.
  This paper seeks to initiate a rigorous approach to the problem of finding
overlapping communities, where ""rigorous"" means that we clearly state the
following: (a) the object sought by our algorithm (b) the assumptions about the
underlying network (c) the (worst-case) running time.
  Our assumptions about the network lie between worst-case and average-case. An
average case analysis would require a precise probabilistic model of the
network, on which there is currently no consensus. However, some plausible
assumptions about network parameters can be gleaned from a long body of work in
the sociology community spanning five decades focusing on the study of
individual communities and ego-centric networks. Thus our assumptions are
somewhat ""local"" in nature. Nevertheless they suffice to permit a rigorous
analysis of running time of algorithms that recover global structure.
  Our algorithms use random sampling similar to that in property testing and
algorithms for dense graphs. However, our networks are not necessarily dense
graphs, not even in local neighborhoods.
  Our algorithms explore a local-global relationship between ego-centric and
socio-centric networks that we hope will provide a fruitful framework for
future work both in computer science and sociology.

X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, an X-ray CCD instrument, onboard the Suzaku
observatory. Using a data set of observed sources in a wide range of brightness
and spectral hardness, we characterized the pileup fraction, spectral
hardening, and grade migration as a function of observed count rate in a frame
per pixel. Using the pileup fraction as a measure of the degree of pileup, we
found that the relative spectral hardening (the hardness ratio normalized to
the intrinsic spectral hardness), branching ratio of split events, and that of
detached events increase monotonically as the pileup fraction increases,
despite the variety of brightness and hardness of the sample sources. We
derived the pileup fraction as a function of radius used for event extraction.
Upon practical considerations, we found that events outside of the radius with
a pileup fraction of 1% or 3% are useful for spectral analysis. We present
relevant figures, tables, and software for the convenience of users who wish to
apply our method for their data reduction of piled-up sources.

disks under the influence of a companion star. We focus on the eccentric
{\gamma} Cephei and {\alpha} Centauri system as examples and compare the disk
quantities such as disk eccentricity and precession rate to previous isothermal
simulations. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the
binary star systems under the assumption of coplanarity of the disk, host star
and binary companion. We use the grid-based, staggered mesh code FARGO with an
additional energy equation to which we added radiative cooling based on opacity
tables. The eccentric binary companion perturbs the disk around the primary
star periodically. Upon passing periastron spirals arms are induced that wind
from the outer disk towards the star. In isothermal simulations this results in
disk eccentricities up to {\epsilon}_disk ~ 0.2, but in more realistic
radiative models we obtain much smaller eccentricities of about {\epsilon}_disk
~ 0.04 - 0.06 with no real precession. Models with varying viscosity and disk
mass indicate show that disks with less mass have lower temperatures and higher
disk eccentricity. The rather large high disk eccentricities, as indicated in
previous isothermal disk simulations, implied a more difficult planet formation
in the {\gamma} Cephei system due to the enhanced collision velocities of
planetesimals. We have shown that under more realistic conditions with
radiative cooling the disk become less eccentric and thus planet formation may
be made easier. However, we estimate that the viscosity in the disk has to very
small, with {\alpha} \lesssim 0.001, because otherwise the disk's lifetime will
be too short to allow planet formation to occur along the core instability
scenario. We estimate that the periodic heating of the disk in eccentric
binaries will be observable in the mid-IR regime.

The framework and method allow organizations to determine what infrastructure

converge in the uniform norm without requiring remappings, extended overlapping
or vanishing moments for the particles. The crux of the method is to use
polynomial expansions of the backward characteristic flow to transport the
numerical particles with improved accuracy: in the first order case the method
consists of representing the transported density with linearly-transformed
particles, the second order version computes quadratically-transformed
particles, and so on. For programming purposes we provide explicit
implementations of the resulting LTP and QTP schemes that only involve
pointwise evaluations of the forward characteristic flow, and also come with
local indicators for the accuracy of the corresponding transport scheme.
Numerical tests using different transport problems demonstrate the accuracy of
the proposed methods compared to standard particle schemes, and establish their
robustness with respect to the remapping period. In particular, it is shown
that QTP particles can be transported without remappings on very long periods
of times, without hampering the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, a
dynamic criterion is proposed to automatically select the time steps where the
particles should be remapped. The strategy does not require additional
inter-particle communications, and it is validated by numerical experiments.

Lorentz scalar confining interaction is complemented by the effective one gluon
exchange. Within presented model we reasonably reproduce all known radial
excitations of the vector charmonia. We have found that $J/\Psi$ is the only
charmonium left bellow naive quark-antiquark threshold $2m_c$, while the all
excited states are situated above this threshold. We develop a method which is
enable to provide solution of full four dimensional BSE for the all excited
states. We discuss the consequences of the use of the free propagators for
calculation of excited states above the threshold. The Bethe-Salpeter string
breaking scale $\mu\simeq 350MeV$ appears to be relatively larger then the one
defined in various potential models $\mu\simeq 150MeV$.

amorphous nanohoneycomb (NHC) films. We then extend our analysis of
superconducting islands induced by film thickness variations in NHC films to
examine the evolution of island sizes through the magnetic field-driven SIT.
Finally, using the islanding picture, we present a plausible model for the
appearance and behavior of the CPI phase in amorphous NHC films.

produce better waveform which are more steeply rising and falling than those

using a diode pair in each collector branch of the transistors. This restricts
the direction of current flow for the charging and discharging of the timing
capacitors. This article also derives the time period of oscillations for the
modified circuit and discusses the limits on source and sink currents at the

quantum effects in quantum anharmonic crystals are presented and discussed. In
particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for a phase transition to occur
at some temperature are given in the form of simple inequalities involving the
interaction strength and the parameters describing a single oscillator. The
main characteristic feature of the theory is that both mentioned phenomena are
described in one and the same setting, in which thermodynamic phases of the
model appear as probability measures on path spaces. Then the possibility of a
phase transition to occur is related to the existence of multiple phases at the
same values of the relevant parameters. Other definitions of phase transitions,
based on the non-differentiability of the free energy density and on the
appearance of ordering, are also discussed.
