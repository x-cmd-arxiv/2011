requires a randomized algorithm to distinguish functions that are identical to
f up to relabeling of the input variables from functions that are far from
being so. An important open question in property testing is to determine for
which functions f we can test f-isomorphism with a constant number of queries.
Despite much recent attention to this question, essentially only two classes of
functions were known to be efficiently isomorphism testable: symmetric
functions and juntas.
  We unify and extend these results by showing that all partially symmetric
functions---functions invariant to the reordering of all but a constant number
of their variables---are efficiently isomorphism-testable. This class of
functions, first introduced by Shannon, includes symmetric functions, juntas,
and many other functions as well. We conjecture that these functions are
essentially the only functions efficiently isomorphism-testable.
  To prove our main result, we also show that partial symmetry is efficiently
testable. In turn, to prove this result we had to revisit the junta testing
problem. We provide a new proof of correctness of the nearly-optimal junta
tester. Our new proof replaces the Fourier machinery of the original proof with
a purely combinatorial argument that exploits the connection between sets of
variables with low influence and intersecting families.
  Another important ingredient in our proofs is a new notion of symmetric
influence. We use this measure of influence to prove that partial symmetry is
efficiently testable and also to construct an efficient sample extractor for
partially symmetric functions. We then combine the sample extractor with the
testing-by-implicit-learning approach to complete the proof that partially
symmetric functions are efficiently isomorphism-testable.

Hitherto known the so-called extreme projectivity turns out to be, speaking
informally, a kind of `asymptotically metric projectivity'.
  Besides, we answer the following concrete question: what can be said about
metrically projective modules in the simplest case of normed spaces? We prove
that metrically projective normed spaces are exactly $l_1^0(M)$, the subspaces

extended to the entire space of time-variables. The so extended HOMFLY

interference at the receivers. It is assumed that all nodes including the relay
have channel state information only for their own links and that the relay has
M (greater than or equal to K) antennas in a K-user network. We pose the
question: What is the benefit of exploiting the direct links from the source to
destinations compared to a simpler two-hop strategy. To answer this question,
we first establish the degrees of freedom of the interference channel with a
MIMO relay, showing that a K-pair network with a MIMO relay has K/2 degrees of
freedom. Thus, appropriate signaling in a two-hop scenario captures the degrees
of freedom without the need for the direct links. We then consider more
sophisticated encoding strategies in search of other ways to exploit the direct
links. Using a number of hybrid encoding strategies, we obtain non-asymptotic
achievable sum-rates. We investigate the case where the relay (unlike other
nodes) has access to abundant power, showing that when sources have power P and

attractive candidate for applications that range from magnetometry to quantum
information processing. Here we show that only a fraction of the nitrogen
(typically < 0.5 %) incorporated during homoepitaxial diamond growth by
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is in the form of undecorated NV- centers.
Furthermore, studies on CVD diamond grown on (110) oriented substrates show a
near 100% preferential orientation of NV- centers along only the [111] and
[-1-11] directions, rather than the four possible orientations. The results
indicate that NV centers grow in as units, as the diamond is deposited, rather
than by migration and association of their components. The NV unit of the NVH-
is similarly preferentially oriented, but it is not possible to determine
whether this defect was formed by H capture at a preferentially aligned NV
center or as a complete unit. Reducing the number of NV orientations from 4
orientations to 2 orientations should lead to increased optically-detected
magnetic resonance contrast and thus improved magnetic sensitivity in
ensemble-based magnetometry.

investigated using time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) along with a
phase discrimination by means of high-speed Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF).
In this paper we focus on the investigation of strategies to optimize the
performance of high-speed PIV algorithms. Furthermore this data will be used
for validation of numerical simulations of two phase flows. To simultaneously
measure the flow velocities inside and around the oil droplet by PIV the
refractive indices of both phases need to be matched. The aqueous phase
consists of a mixture of corn syrup and water, which defines the viscosity as
well as the refractive index. The disperse phase consists of a mixture of two
mineral oils. The latter are mixed to match the refractive index of the
continuous phase. Both phases are seeded with tracer particles required for
PIV. A fluorescent dye is added to the dispersed phase to allow discrimination
of the PIV signals originating from both phases by LIF. The LIF and PIV signals
are captured by two high-speed cameras. In order to study the impact of an oil
droplet into an oil-water interface, it is necessary to accurately measure a
velocity range that is spread over three orders of magnitude. The impact of the
droplet is measured in a time series of PIV recordings with a high temporal
resolution. This allows to optimize the time interval between two correlated
frames within the time series to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, while
still being able to measure a large velocity dynamic range. An approach to
estimate an optimal time separation is presented in this study. The results are
compared to the experimental data and the effectiveness of the introduced
optimization on the data quality is discussed. Furthermore, the results of this
experiment are compared to a numerical simulation.

analysis approaches, such as runtime verification, testing, monitoring, and
specification mining. Execution traces are frequently parametric, i.e., they
contain events with parameter bindings. Each parametric trace usually consists
of many meaningful trace slices merged together, each slice corresponding to
one parameter binding. This gives a semantics-based solution to parametric
trace analysis. A general-purpose parametric trace slicing technique is
introduced, which takes each event in the parametric trace and dispatches it to
its corresponding trace slices. This parametric trace slicing technique can be
used in combination with any conventional, non-parametric trace analysis
technique, by applying the later on each trace slice. As an instance, a
parametric property monitoring technique is then presented. The presented
parametric trace slicing and monitoring techniques have been implemented and
extensively evaluated. Measurements of runtime overhead confirm that the
generality of the discussed techniques does not come at a performance expense
when compared with existing parametric trace monitoring systems.

either nonextremal or extremal, can be broadly defined as the limiting
configuration of a body when its boundary approaches the body's own

of being black holes but actually are distinct from them in many ways. We
display some of their properties: there are infinite redshift whole regions;
the curvature invariants remain perfectly regular everywhere, in the quasiblack
hole limit; a free-falling observer finds in his own frame infinitely large
tidal forces in the whole inner region, showing some form of degeneracy; outer
and inner regions become mutually impenetrable and disjoint, although, in
contrast to the usual black holes, this separation is of a dynamical nature,
rather than purely causal; for external far away observers the spacetime is

is two-fold. First, we propose an incentivized forwarding based resource

the same system with Boltzmann statistics. Each term in this expansion can be
associated with a Lee-Yang graph. We elucidate a physical meaning of each

dimers, an infinite sum of the ladder-type Lee-Yang 0-graphs is shown to lead
to Bose-Einstein condensation of dimers below the critical temperature. In the
case of Bose statistics, an infinite series of Lee-Yang 1-graphs is shown to
converge and gives the criteria of ODLRO at the one-particle level.

class constraints. This method is appropriate for imposing infinite series of
constraints due to the boundary conditions. We use this method for massive
bosonic strings in a background B-field and find the correct expansions of the
fields in terms of the physical modes. We have found a canonical basis for this
model.

equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension $n-3$. If $P$ is connected, then
the number of spheres is equal to the number of linear extensions of $P$. In
general, the number of spheres is equal to the number of cyclic extensions of
$P$.

observing ultra high energy cosmic rays to understand their origins. The
experiment involves a surface detector (SD) array and three fluorescence
detector (FD) stations. FD stations, installed surrounding the SD array,
measure the air fluorescence light emitted from extensive air showers (EASs)
for precise determination of their energies and species. The detectors employed
at one of the three FD stations were relocated from the High Resolution Fly's
Eye experiment. At the other two stations, newly designed detectors were
constructed for the TA experiment. An FD consists of a primary mirror and a
camera equipped with photomultiplier tubes. To obtain the EAS parameters with
high accuracies, understanding the FD optical characteristics is important. In
this paper, we report the characteristics and installation of new FDs and the
performances of the FD components. The results of the monitored mirror
reflectance during the observation time are also described in this report.
