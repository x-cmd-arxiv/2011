(directed or undirected) graph against Robber. Robber and the cops are placed
on the vertices of the graph; they take turns in moving to adjacent vertices
(or staying), cops inside the guarded region, Robber on the remaining vertices
(the robber-region). The goal of Robber is to enter the guarded region at a
vertex with no cop on it. The problem is to determine whether for a given graph
and given number of cops the cops are able to prevent Robber from entering the
guarded region. Fomin et al. [Fomin, Golovach, Hall, Mihalak, Vicari, Widmayer:
How to Guard a Graph? Algorithmica 61(4), 839--856 (2011)] proved that the
problem is NP-complete when the robber-region is restricted to a tree. Further
they prove that is it PSPACE-complete when the robber-region is restricted to a
directed acyclic graph, and they ask about the problem complexity for arbitrary
graphs. In this paper we prove that the problem is E-complete for arbitrary
directed graphs.

chains with one molecule in each layer. We consider the effects of the
intralayer repulsion and quantum statistical requirements in systems with more
than one chain. Specifically, we consider the case of two chains and solve the
problem analytically within the harmonic Hamiltonian approach which is accurate
for large dipole moments. The case of three chains is calculated numerically.
Our findings indicate that thermodynamic observables, such as the heat
capacity, can be used to probe the signatures of the intralayer interaction
between chains. This should be relevant for near future experiments on polar
molecules with strong dipole moments.

counterclockwise directions in a flux qubit do not conserve the angular
momentum of the qubit. To compensate for this effect the solid containing the

quantum states of the qubit with quantum states of a macroscopic body. The
question then arises whether slow decoherence of quantum oscillations of the
current is consistent with fast decoherence of quantum states of a macroscopic

qubit embedded in an absolutely rigid solid and for the elastic model that
conserves the total angular momentum. We show that while the quantum state of a

slow decoherence is permitted if the system is macroscopically large. Practical

scattering and inverse scattering theory. PETs do not affect scattering phase
shifts and bound state energies of two-body system but are conventionally
supposed to modify two-body bound state observables such as the rms radius and
electromagnetic moments. Purpose: In order to preserve all bound state
observables, we propose a new particular case of PETs, a deuteron-equivalent
transformation (DET-PET), which leaves unchanged not only scattering phase
shifts and bound state (deuteron) binding energy but also the bound state wave
function. Methods: The construction of DET-PET is discussed; equations defining
the simplest DET-PETs are derived. We apply these simplest DET-PETs to the
JISP16 $NN$ interaction and use the transformed $NN$ interactions in
calculations of $^3$H and $^4$He binding energies in the No-core Full
Configuration (NCFC) approach based on extrapolations of the No-core Shell
Model (NCSM) basis space results to the infinite basis space. Results: We
demonstrate the DET-PET modification of the $np$ scattering wave functions and
study the DET-PET manifestation in the binding energies of $^3$H and $^4$He
nuclei and their correlation (Tjon line). Conclusions: It is shown that some
DET-PETs generate modifications of the central component while the others
modify the tensor component of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs are able to
modify significantly the $np$ scattering wave functions and hence the off-shell
properties of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs give rise to significant changes
in the binding energies of $^3$H (in the range of approximately 1.5 MeV) and
$^4$He (in the range of more than 9 MeV) and are able to modify the correlation
patterns of binding energies of these nuclei.

  A perceived advantage for the replacement of a discontinuous square-well
pseudo-potential, which is often used by various researchers as an
approximation to the actual C$_{60}$ cage potential in calculations of
endohedral atoms $A$@C$_{60}$, by a more realistic diffuse potential is
explored. The photoionization of endohedral H@C$_{60}$ and Xe@C$_{60}$ is
chosen as the case study. The diffuse potential is modelled by a combination of
two Woods-Saxon potentials. It is demonstrated that photoionization spectra of
$A$@C$_{60}$ atoms are largely insensitive to the degree $\eta$ of diffuseness
of the potential borders, in a reasonably broad range of $\eta$'s.
Alternatively, these spectra are found to be insensitive to discontinuity of
the square-well potential either. Both potentials result in practically
identical calculated spectra. New numerical values for the set of square-well
parameters, which lead to a better agreement between experimental and
theoretical data for $A$@C$_{60}$ spectra, are recommended for future studies.

by instantaneous quenches of the transverse field (the transverse field varying
as rectangular wave symmetric about zero). Two interesting phenomena are
reported and analyzed: (1) We observe dynamical many-body freezing or DMF
(Phys. Rev. B, vol. 82, 172402, 2010), i.e. strongly non-monotonic freezing of
the response (transverse magnetization) with respect to the driving parameters
(pulse width and height) resulting from equivocal freezing behavior of all the
many-body modes. The freezing occurs due to coherent suppression of dynamics of
the many-body modes. For certain combination of the pulse height and period,
maximal freezing (freezing peaks) are observed. For those parameter values, a
massive collapse of the entire Floquet spectrum occurs. (2) Secondly, we
observe emergence of a distinct solitary oscillation with a single frequency,
which can be much lower than the driving frequency. This slow oscillation,
involving many high-energy modes, dominates the response remarkably in the
limit of long observation time. We identify this slow oscillation as the unique
survivor of destructive quantum interference between the many-body modes. The
oscillation is found to decay algebraically with time to a constant value. All
the key features are demonstrated analytically with numerical evaluations for
specific results.

results have been obtained which are very encouraging because Abelian infrared
dominance has been found: The Abelian part of the gauge field propagator is
enhanced at low momenta and thereby dominates the dynamics in the infrared.
Also the ambiguity of two different types of solutions (decoupling and scaling)
exists in both gauges. It is demonstrated how the two solutions are related in

permits a kind of interpolation between non commutativity and full

the Grothendieck group completion of the former, up to the free adjunction of a

to various microstructural details. Due to large surface to volume ratio,
phenomena at the nanoscale require consideration of surface energy effects and
the latter are frequently used to interpret size-effects in material behavior.
Elucidation of the effect of surface roughness on the surface stress and
elastic behavior is relatively under-studied and quite relevant to the behavior
of nanostructures. In this work, we present derivations that relate both
periodic and random roughness to the effective surface elastic behavior. We
find that the residual surface stress is hardly affected by roughness while the
superficial elasticity properties are dramatically altered and, importantly,
may also result in a change in its sign - this has ramifications in
interpretation of sensing based on frequency measurement changes due to surface
elasticity. We show that the square of resonance frequency of a cantilever beam

approaches to the general problem of strongly correlated electronic systems
with disorder. We first describe the standard DMFT approach, which is exact in
the limit of large coordination, and explain why in its simplest form it cannot
capture either Anderson localization or the glassy behavior of electrons.
Various extensions of DMFT are then described, including statistical DMFT,
typical medium theory, and extended DMFT, methods specifically designed to
overcome the limitations of the original formulation. We provide an overview of
the results obtained using these approaches, including the formation of
electronic Griffiths phases, the self-organized criticality of the Coulomb
glass, and the two-fluid behavior near Mott-Anderson transitions. Finally, we
outline research directions that may provide a route to bridge the gap between
the DMFT-based theories and the complementary diffusion-mode approaches to the
metal-insulator transition.

folding process is central to understanding the underlying physics of folding.
Stability of the folding process means that many perturbations do not disrupt
the progress from the random coil to the native state. In this paper we explore
the stability of folding using established methods from physics and
mathematics. Our result is a preliminary theory of the physics of folding. We
suggest some tests of these ideas using folding simulations.
  We begin by supposing that folding events are related in some way to
mechanical waves on the molecule. We adopt an analytical approach to the
physics which was pioneered by M.V. Berry, (in another context), based upon
mathematics developed mainly by R. Thom and V.I. Arnold. We find that the
stability of the folding process can be understood in terms of structures known
as caustics, which occur in many kinds of wave phenomena.
  The picture that emerges is that natural selection has given us a set of
protein molecules which have mechanical waves that propagate according to
several mathematically specific restrictions. Successful simulations of folding
can be used to test and constrain these wave motions. With some additional
assumptions the theory explains or is consistent with a number of experimental
facts about folding. We emphasize that this wave-based approach is
fundamentally different from energy-based approaches.

behind the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) in
their orbit about the Milky Way. After investigating 8 million possible orbits
consistent with the latest proper motions, we adopt an orbital history in which
the LMC and SMC have only recently become a strongly interacting binary pair.
We find that their first close encounter 2 Gyr ago provides the necessary tidal
forces to disrupt the disk of the SMC and thereby create the MS. The model also
reproduces the on-sky bifurcation of the two filaments of the MS, and we
suggest that a bound association with the Milky Way is required to reproduce
the bifurcation. Additional HI structures are created during the tidal
evolution of the SMC disk, including the Magellanic Bridge, the
""Counter-Bridge"", and two branches of leading material. Insights into the
chemical evolution of the LMC are also provided, as a substantial fraction of
the material stripped away from the SMC is engulfed by the LMC. Lastly we
compare three different N-body realizations of the stellar component of the
SMC, which we model as a pressure-supported spheroid motivated by recent
kinematical observations. We find that an extended spheroid is better able to
explain the stellar periphery of the SMC, and the tidal evolution of the
spheroid may imply the existence of a stellar stream akin to the gaseous MS.

solutions describing solitons and hairy black holes are found. It is shown that
they fit within a relaxed set of asymptotically AdS boundary conditions, whose
asymptotic symmetry group coincides with the one for pure gravity and its
canonical realization possesses the standard central extension. Solitons are
devoid of integration constants and their (negative) mass, fixed and determined
by nontrivial functions of the self-interaction couplings, is shown to be
bounded from below by the mass of AdS spacetime. Remarkably, assuming that a
soliton corresponds to the ground state of the sector of the theory for which
the scalar field is switched on, the semiclassical entropy of the corresponding
hairy black hole is exactly reproduced from Cardy formula once nonvanishing
lowest eigenvalues of the Virasoro operators are taking into account, being
precisely given by the ones associated to the soliton. This provides further
evidence about the robustness of previous results, for which the ground state

kinematically allowed two-body decay of the Z_H boson is Z_H-> A_H H and thus
one-loop induced two-body decays may have a significant rate. We study the
Z_H-> \gamma A_H decay, which is induced at the one-loop level by a fermion
triangle and is interesting as it depends on the mechanism of anomaly
cancellation of the model. All the relevant two- and three-body decays of the
Z_H gauge boson arising at the tree-level are also calculated. We consider a
small region of the parameter space where the scale of the symmetry breaking f
is still allowed to be as low as 500 GeV by electroweak precision data. We
first analyze the scenario of a Higgs boson with a mass of 120 GeV. We found
that the Z_H->\gamma A_H branching ratio can be of the order of a tree-level
three-body decay and may be at the reach of detection at the LHC for f close to
500 GeV, but it may be difficult to detect for f=1 TeV. There is also an
scenario where the Higgs boson has an intermediate mass such that the Z_H-> A_H
H decay is closed, the Z_H-> \gamma A_H gets considerably enhanced and the
chances of detection get a large boost.

stationary black hole. We show how this can be made to work if various
restrictions are imposed on the nature of the horizon slices and the

relations between various parameters linking cycle's shape and amplitude, in
particular the Waldmeier relations. As solar cycle is believed to be a result
of the solar dynamo action, these relations require explanation in the
framework of this theory.Here we aim to present a possible explanation of such
kind. We relate the cycle-to-cycle variability of solar activity to
fluctuations of solar dynamo drivers and primarily to fluctuations in the
parameter responsible for recovery of the poloidal magnetic field from the
toroidal one. To be specific, we develop such a model in the framework of the
mean-field dynamo based on the differential rotation and $\alpha$-effect. We
demonstrate that the mean-field dynamo based on a realistic rotation curve and
nonlinearity associated with the magnetic helicity balance reproduces both
qualitatively and quantitatively the Waldmeier relations observed in sunspot
data since 1750 (SIDC data). The model also reproduces more or less
successfully other relations between the parameters under discussion, in
particular, the link between odd and even cycles (Gnevyshev-Ohl rule). We
conclude that the contemporary solar dynamo theory provides a way to explain
the cycle-to-cycle variability of solar activity as recorded in sunspots. We
discuss the importance of the model for stellar activity cycles which, as known
from the data of HK project, demonstrate the cycle-to-cycle variability similar
to solar cycles.

for better management, smart navigation, efficient filtering, and concise

next challenge lies in semantically performing clustering based on the semantic
contents of the document. The problem of document clustering has two main
components: (1) to represent the document in such a form that inherently
captures semantics of the text. This may also help to reduce dimensionality of
the document, and (2) to define a similarity measure based on the semantic
representation such that it assigns higher numerical values to document pairs
which have higher semantic relationship. Feature space of the documents can be
very challenging for document clustering. A document may contain multiple
topics, it may contain a large set of class-independent general-words, and a
handful class-specific core-words. With these features in mind, traditional
agglomerative clustering algorithms, which are based on either Document Vector
model (DVM) or Suffix Tree model (STC), are less efficient in producing results
with high cluster quality. This paper introduces a new approach for document
clustering based on the Topic Map representation of the documents. The document
is being transformed into a compact form. A similarity measure is proposed
based upon the inferred information through topic maps data and structures. The
suggested method is implemented using agglomerative hierarchal clustering and
tested on standard Information retrieval (IR) datasets. The comparative

effect of magnetic diffusivity in the magnetospheric accretion-ejection

so that reconnection is enabled by the physical as well as the numerical
resistivity. We show, for the first time, that quasi-stationary fast ejecta of
matter, which we call {\em micro-ejections}, of small mass and angular momentum
fluxes, can be launched from a purely resistive magnetosphere. They are
produced by a combination of pressure gradient and magnetic forces, in presence
of ongoing magnetic reconnection along the boundary layer between the star and
the disk, where a current sheet is formed. Mass flux of micro-ejection
increases with increasing magnetic field strength and stellar rotation rate,
and is not dependent on the disk to corona density ratio and amount of
resistivity.

the state estimation error under sparse bad data and additive observation

nonlinear, we give conditions under which the solution of the iterative
algorithm converges to the true state even though the locally linearized

(protostar). A flared disk and a bipolar cavity in the models of Class I
sources lead to more complicated SEDs. From the present AzTEC observations of
the MBM12 region, it appears that other sources detected with AzTEC are likely

Monte Carlo code (called MOCCA), in addition to the features of the old
version, incorporates the direct Fewbody integrator (Fregeau et al. 2004) for
three- and four-body interactions, and a new treatment of the escape process
based on Fukushige & Heggie (2000). Now stars which fulfil the escape criterion
are not removed immediately, but can stay in the system for a certain time
which depends on the excess of the energy of a star above the escape energy.
They are called potential escapers. With the addition of the Fewbody integrator
the code can follow all interaction channels which are important for the rate
of creation of various types of objects observed in star clusters, and ensures
that the energy generation by binaries is treated in a manner similar to the
$N$-body model.

$N$-body simulations for large $N$: two (or one, depending on the chosen
approach) connected with the escape process, and one responsible for the
determination of the interaction probabilities. The values adopted for the free
parameters have at most a weak dependence on $N$. They allow MOCCA to reproduce
$N$-body results with reasonable precision, not only for the rate of cluster
evolution and the cluster mass distribution, but also for the detailed
distributions of mass and binding energy of binaries. Additionally, the code
can follow the rate of formation of blue stragglers and black hole - black hole
binaries.

driven mass and energy flows through the inner ~200 pc (in diameter) of the
Galaxy. Our modelling is constrained, in particular, by the non-thermal radio
continuum and {\gamma}-ray signals detected from the region. The modelling
points to a current star-formation rate of 0.04 - 0.12 M\msun/year at 2{\sigma}
confidence within the region with best-fit value in the range 0.08 - 0.12
M\msun/year which - if sustained over 10 Gyr - would fill out the ~ 10^9 M\msun
stellar population of the nuclear bulge. Mass is being accreted on to the
Galactic centre (GC) region at a rate ~0.3M\msun/year. The region's
star-formation activity drives an outflow of plasma, cosmic rays, and
entrained, cooler gas. Neither the plasma nor the entrained gas reaches the
gravitational escape speed, however, and all this material fountains back on to
the inner Galaxy. The system we model can naturally account for the
recently-observed ~> 10^6 'halo' of molecular gas surrounding the Central
Molecular Zone out to 100-200 pc heights. The injection of cooler,
high-metallicity material into the Galactic halo above the GC may catalyse the
subsequent cooling and condensation of hot plasma out of this region and
explain the presence of relatively pristine, nuclear-unprocessed gas in the GC.
The plasma outflow from the GC reaches a height of a few kpc and is
compellingly related to the recently-discovered Fermi Bubbles. Our modelling
demonstrates that ~ 10^9 M\msun of hot gas is processed through the GC over 10
Gyr. We speculate that the continual star-formation in the GC over the age of
the Milky Way has kept the SMBH in a quiescent state thus preventing it from
significantly heating the coronal gas, allowing for the continual accretion of
gas on to the disk and the sustenance of star formation on much wider scales in
the Galaxy [abridged].

interest and possibly represents a useful analogue to star-burst nuclei which
we can observe with orders of magnitude finer detail than these external
systems. The environmental conditions in the GC - here taken to mean the inner
200 pc in diameter of the Milky Way - are extreme with respect to those
typically encountered in the Galactic disk. The energy densities of the various
GC ISM components are typically ~two orders of magnitude larger than those
found locally and the star-formation rate density ~three orders of magnitude
larger. Unusually within the Galaxy, the Galactic centre exhibits
hard-spectrum, diffuse TeV (=10^12 eV) gamma-ray emission spatially coincident
with the region's molecular gas. Recently the nuclei of local star-burst
galaxies NGC 253 and M82 have also been detected in gamma-rays of such
energies. We have embarked on an extended campaign of modelling the broadband
(radio continuum to TeV gamma-ray), non- thermal signals received from the
inner 200 pc of the Galaxy. On the basis of this modelling we find that
star-formation and associated supernova activity is the ultimate driver of the
region's non-thermal activity. This activity drives a large-scale wind of hot
plasma and cosmic rays out of the GC. The wind advects the locally-accelerated
cosmic rays quickly, before they can lose much energy in situ or penetrate into
the densest molecular gas cores where star-formation occurs. The cosmic rays
can, however, heat/ionize the lower density/warm H2 phase enveloping the cores.
On very large scales (~10 kpc) the non-thermal signature of the escaping GC
cosmic rays has probably been detected recently as the spectacular 'Fermi
bubbles' and corresponding 'WMAP haze'.

We seek to design scheduling algorithms such that the given transmission

problem on an $n$ processor linear array/ring network. In the {\em stationary}
version, the pattern of transmissions (given) is assumed to not change over
time. For this, a simple lower bound is $c$, the congestion or the maximum
total traffic required to pass through any link. We give an algorithm that
schedules the transmissions using $O(c+\log{n})$ wavelengths. We also show a
pattern for which $\Omega(c+\log{n}/\log\log{n})$ wavelengths are needed. In
the {\em on-line} version, the transmissions arrive and depart dynamically, and
must be scheduled without upsetting the previously scheduled transmissions. For
this case we give an on-line algorithm which has competitive ratio
$\Theta(\log{n})$. We show that this is optimal in the sense that every on-line
algorithm must have competitive ratio $\Omega(\log{n})$. We also give an
algorithm that appears to do well in simulation (for the classes of traffic we
consider), but which has competitive ratio between $\Omega(\log^2n/\log

O(k+\log^2 d + \log d\cd \log s). As a corollary, we obtain a quasipolynomial

P_c(F) proofs of polynomial-size and O(\log^2 n) depth. Moreover, there exists
an arithmetic formula det of size n^{O(\log n)} such that the above identities

density power spectrum provides the size distribution of the structures. We
find that a single power law might be fitted to the calculated power spectrum
of the 1.1 mm emission between 0.3 pc and 0.03 pc. The slope of the best fit
power law is \gamma \sim -2.6 and is similar to the spectral index of the power
spectrum of \gamma \sim -2.7 found in numerical simulations. However, there is
a distinct spectral break in the power spectrum at a characteristic scale of
~0.3 pc in OMC1. The effects of beam size and noise spectrum on the shape and
slope of the power spectrum are also included in the present analysis. The
slope of the power law and a range of different scales change at scales below
~0.3 pc as the beam size increases.

Vardi","Reasoning About Strategies: On the Model-Checking Problem",,,,,"cs.LO cs.MA math.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In open systems verification, to formally check for reliability, one needs an
appropriate formalism to model the interaction between agents and express the
correctness of the system no matter how the environment behaves. An important
contribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic ability, in
the setting of multi-agent games, such as ATL, ATL\star, and the like.
Recently, Chatterjee, Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which
we denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim of getting a powerful framework for
reasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained by using first-order
quantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific
setting of two-agents turned-based games, where a non-elementary model-checking
algorithm has been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim
that it does not fully capture the strategic aspects of multi-agent systems. In
this paper, we introduce and study a more general strategy logic, denoted SL,
for reasoning about strategies in multi-agent concurrent games. We prove that
SL includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In
particular, the algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the
best one known for CHP-SL. Moreover, we prove that such a problem for SL is
NonElementarySpace-hard. This negative result has spurred us to investigate
here syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL\star, with the hope of
obtaining an elementary model-checking problem. Among the others, we study the
sublogics SL[NG], SL[BG], and SL[1G]. They encompass formulas in a special
prenex normal form having, respectively, nested temporal goals, Boolean
combinations of goals and, a single goal at a time. About these logics, we
prove that the model-checking problem for SL[1G] is 2ExpTime-complete, thus not
harder than the one for ATL\star.

ordering within mean-field theory but with a formalism that takes into account
the full n-body nature of van der Waals forces. Dielectric anisotropy within
polymers is to be expected as the electronic properties of the polymer will
typically be different along the polymer than across its cross section. It is
therefore physically intuitive that larger charge fluctuations can be induced
along the chain than perpendicular to it. We show that this dielectric
anisotropy leads to n-body interactions which can induce an isotropic--nematic
transition. The two body and three body components of the full van der Waals
interaction are extracted and it is shown how the two body term behaves like
the phenomenological self-aligning-pairwise nematic interaction. At the three
body interaction level we see that the nematic phase that is energetically
favorable is discotic, however on the full n-body interaction level we find
that the normal axial nematic phase is always the stable ordered phase. The
n-body nature of our approach also shows that the key parameter driving the
nematic-isotropic transition is the bare persistence length of the polymer
chain.

increases in conductance when a new conductance channel associated to a change
in magnetic structure is open. Typically, the magnetic moment carried by an
adsorbate can be changed by collision with a tunneling electron; in this
process the spin of the electron can flip or not. A previous one-electron
theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 103}, 176601 (2009)] successfully explained both
the conductance thresholds and the magnitude of the conductance variation. The
elastic spin flip of conduction electrons by a magnetic impurity leads to the
well known Kondo effect. In the present work, we compare the theoretical
predictions for inelastic magnetic tunneling obtained with a one-electron
approach and with a many-body theory including Kondo-like phenomena. We apply
our theories to a singlet-triplet transition model system that contains most of
the characteristics revealed in magnetic IETS. We use two self-consistent
treatments (non-crossing approximation and self-consistent ladder
approximation). We show that, although the one-electron limit is properly
recovered, new intrinsic many-body features appear. In particular, sharp peaks
appear close to the inelastic thresholds; these are not localized exactly at
thresholds and could influence the determination of magnetic structures from
IETS experiments.Analysis of the evolution with temperature reveals that these
many-body features involve an energy scale different from that of the usual
Kondo peaks. Indeed, the many-body features perdure at temperatures much larger
than the one given by the Kondo energy scale of the system.

engineering turbulence modelling, and proposed by Prandtl in 1925 and von
Karman in 1930 to describe the mean velocity of a turbulent wall-bounded flow -
leads to a logarithmic profile in an overlap region near the wall. For over
eighty years, its value was believed to be ~0.41. But more recently, many argue
that it is not a constant, because of measured variations in different flows
and at different Reynolds numbers (Re). Here, a multi-layer analytic theory is
shown to lead to a re-interpretation of \kappa as a global constant for both
the overlap region and outer flow, and to yield a new method for its
measurement. The newly determined value is 0.45 for both channel and pipe. It
is shown that this new \kappa, together with other wall constants, yields a 99%
accuracy in the prediction of mean velocity data at all points in high Re (up
to 40 million) pipe flow. The theory also describes finite Re effect, and
discovers a transition at the friction Re (i.e. Re_\tau)=5000. An accurate
model for the prediction of turbulent transport in canonical pipe and channel
flows is achieved here, and we propose the model to be valid for a wide class
of turbulent flows.

turbulent flows (channel, pipe, and turbulent boundary layer - TBL) is of great
importance from both physics and engineering standpoints. Here (Part I), we
present a symmetry-based approach which derives analytic expressions governing
the mean velocity profile (MVP) from an innovative Lie-group analysis. The new
approach begins by identifying a set of order functions (e.g. stress length,
shear-induced eddy length), in analogy with the order parameter in Landau's
mean-field theory, which aims at capturing symmetry aspects of the fluctuations
(e.g. Reynolds stress, dissipation). The order functions are assumed to satisfy
a dilation group invariance - representing the effects of the wall on
fluctuations - which allows us to postulate three new kinds of invariant
solutions of the mean momentum equation (MME), focusing on group invariants of
the order functions (rather than those of the mean velocity as done in previous
studies). The first - a power law solution - gives functional forms for the
viscous sublayer, the buffer layer, the log-layer, and a newly identified
central `core' (for channel and pipe, but non-existent for TBL). The second - a
defect power law of form $1-r^{m}$ ($r$ being the distance from the center
line) - describes the `bulk zone' (the region of balance between production and
dissipation). The third - a relation between the group invariants of the stress
length function and its first derivative - describes scaling transition between
adjacent layers. A combination of these three expressions yields a multi-layer
formula covering the entire flow domain, identifying three important
parameters: scaling exponent, layer thickness, and transition sharpness. All
three kinds of invariant solutions are validated, individually and in
combination, by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS).

distinct non-monotonic variation as a function of pump fluence. The transition
energy shift, strength, spectral width and density-dependent ultrafast
relaxation manifest a remarkable re-emergence of the resonances after initial
quenching. Our simulation, incorporating the first-order diffraction from the
photoinduced transient grating, reproduces the salient features, providing a
new avenue for designing nonlinear and frequency-agile THz modulators.

presented in this paper. We constrain the model parameters with the
observational data and thus the results become broadly consistent with those
expected from experiment. Stability analysis of the model without best fitting
shows that universe may begin from an unstable state passing a saddle point and
finally become stable in future. However, with the best fitted model, There is
no saddle intermediate state. The agegraphic dark energy in the model by itself
exhibits a phantom behavior. However, contribution of cold dark matter on the
effective energy density modifies the state of teh universe from phantom phase
to quintessence one. The statefinder diagnosis also indicates that the universe
leaves an unstable state in the past, passes the LCDM state and finally
approaches the sable state in future.

electrodiffusion across a liquid junction is reconsidered. It involves three
coupled first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and has the
second-order Painlev\'e II equation at its core. Solutions are now grouped by
B\""acklund transformations into infinite sequences, partially labelled by two
B\""acklund invariants. Each sequence is characterized by evenly-spaced
quantized fluxes of the two ionic species, and hence evenly-spaced quantization
of the electric current-density. Finite subsequences of exact solutions are
identified, with positive ionic concentrations and quantized fluxes, starting
from a solution with zero electric field found by Planck, and suggesting an
interpretation as a ground state plus excited states of the system. Positivity
of ionic concentrations is established whenever Planck's charge-neutral
boundary-conditions apply. Exact solutions are obtained for the electric field
and ionic concentrations in well-stirred reservoirs outside each face of the
junction, enabling the formulation of more realistic boundary-conditions. In an
approximate form, these lead to radiation boundary conditions for Painlev\'e
II. Illustrative numerical solutions are presented, and the problem of
establishing compatibility of boundary conditions with the structure of
flux-quantizing sequences is discussed.

hence stronger) compared to classical correlations, but they are more
disciplined in a mathematically very precise sense. This raises an important
physical question: What is responsible for making quantum correlations so much
more disciplined? Here we explain the observed discipline of quantum
correlations by identifying the symmetries of our physical space with those of
a parallelized 7-sphere. We substantiate this identification by proving that
any quantum correlation can be understood as a classical, local-realistic
correlation among a set of points of a parallelized 7-sphere.
