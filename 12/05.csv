Laplacian matrix of a network and the behavior of dynamical processes evolving
in it, we propose a distributed iterative algorithm in which a group of $n$
autonomous agents self-organize the structure of their communication network in
order to control the network's eigenvalue spectrum. In our algorithm, we assume
that each agent has access only to a local (myopic) view of the network around
it. In each iteration, agents in the network peform a decentralized decision
process to determine the edge addition/deletion that minimizes a distance
function defined in the space of eigenvalue spectra. This spectral distance
presents interesting theoretical properties that allow an efficient distributed
implementation of the decision process. Our iterative algorithm is stable by
construction, i.e., locally optimizes the network's eigenvalue spectrum, and is
shown to perform extremely well in practice. We illustrate our results with
nontrivial simulations in which we design networks matching the spectral
properties of complex networks, such as small-world and power-law networks.

spatially homogeneous systems with long-range interactions taking collective
effects into account. The evolution of the system as a whole is described by
the Lenard-Balescu equation which is valid in a weak coupling approximation.
When collective effects are neglected it reduces to the Landau equation and
when collisions (correlations) are neglected it reduces to the Vlasov equation.
The relaxation of a test particle in a bath is described by a Fokker-Planck
equation involving a diffusion term and a friction term. For a thermal bath,
the diffusion and friction coefficients are connected by an Einstein relation.
General expressions of the diffusion and friction coefficients are given,
depending on the potential of interaction and on the dimension of space. We
also discuss the scaling with $N$ (number of particles) or with $\Lambda$
(plasma parameter) of the relaxation time towards statistical equilibrium.
Finally, we consider the effect of an external stochastic forcing on the
evolution of the system and compute the corresponding term in the kinetic
equation.

telescope observations. These counting type instruments have a field of view of
few degrees in diameter and record large numbers of particle air showers via
their Cherenkov radiation in the atmosphere. The showers are either induced by
gamma rays or diffuse cosmic ray background. The commonly used test statistic
to evaluate a possible gamma-ray excess is Li and Ma (1983), Eq. 17, which can
be applied to independent on- and off-source observations, or scenarios that
can be approximated as such. This formula however is unsuitable if the data are
taken in so-called ""wobble"" mode (pointing to several offset positions around
the source), if at the same time the acceptance shape is irregular or even
depends on operating parameters such as the pointing direction or telescope
multiplicity. To provide a robust test statistic in such cases, this paper
explores a possible generalization of the likelihood ratio concept on which the
formula of Li and Ma is based. In doing so, the multi-pointing nature of the
data and the typically known instrument point spread function are fully
exploited to derive a new, semi-numerical test statistic. Due to its
flexibility and robustness against systematic uncertainties, it is not only
useful for detection purposes, but also for skymapping and source shape
fitting. Simplified Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the

linear system As=x admits a sparse solution s0 for which ||s0||_0 < 1/2
spark(A). Such a sparse solution is unique due to a well-known uniqueness
theorem. Suppose now that we have somehow a solution s_hat as an estimation of
s0, and suppose that s_hat is only `approximately sparse', that is, many of its
components are very small and nearly zero, but not mathematically equal to
zero. Is such a solution necessarily close to the true sparsest solution? More
generally, is it possible to construct an upper bound on the estimation error
||s_hat-s0||_2 without knowing s0? The answer is positive, and in this paper we
construct such a bound based on minimal singular values of submatrices of A. We
will also state a tight bound, which is more complicated, but besides being
tight, enables us to study the case of random dictionaries and obtain
probabilistic upper bounds. We will also study the noisy case, that is, where
x=As+n. Moreover, we will see that where ||s0||_0 grows, to obtain a
predetermined guaranty on the maximum of ||s_hat-s0||_2, s_hat is needed to be
sparse with a better approximation. This can be seen as an explanation to the
fact that the estimation quality of sparse recovery algorithms degrades where
||s0||_0 grows.

be solved in time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$, a bound that has resisted improvement

$O(m\epsilon^{-1}\log\epsilon^{-1})$ time, that is, optimal {\em linear time}

exact maximum weight matching algorithms on general graphs and should be
appealing in all applications that can tolerate a negligible relative error.
  Our second contribution is a new {\em exact} maximum weight matching
algorithm for integer-weighted bipartite graphs that runs in time
$O(m\sqrt{n}\log N)$. This improves on the $O(Nm\sqrt{n})$-time and

optimization problems) to represent preference theories. The formalism uses
separate modules to describe the space of outcomes to be compared (the
generator) and the preferences on outcomes (the selector). We consider two
types of optimization problems. They differ in the way the generator, which we
model by a propositional theory, is interpreted: by the standard propositional
logic semantics, and by the equilibrium-model (answer-set) semantics. Under the
latter interpretation of generators, optimization problems directly generalize
answer-set optimization programs proposed previously. We study strong
equivalence of optimization problems, which guarantees their interchangeability
within any larger context. We characterize several versions of strong
equivalence obtained by restricting the class of optimization problems that can
be used as extensions and establish the complexity of associated reasoning
tasks. Understanding strong equivalence is essential for modular representation
of optimization problems and rewriting techniques to simplify them without
changing their inherent properties.

monolithically integrated transducer system consisting of a high-$Q$
nanomechanical oscillator with modes in the MHz regime coupled to the
near-field of a high-$Q$ optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. The
transducer system enables a sensitive resolution of the nanomechanical beam's
thermal motion with a signal-to-noise of five orders of magnitude and has a
force sensitivity of $74\,\rm{aN}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at room temperature. We
show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the sensitivity of continuous
incoherent force detection improves only with the fourth root of the averaging
time. Using dissipative feedback based on radiation pressure enabled control,
we explicitly demonstrate by detecting a weak incoherent force that this
constraint can be significantly relaxed. We achieve a more than 30-fold
reduction in averaging time with our hybrid transducer and are able to detect
an incoherent force having a force spectral density as small as
$15\,\rm{aN}\,\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ within $35\,\rm{s}$ of averaging. This
corresponds to a signal which is 25 times smaller than the thermal noise and
would otherwise remain out of reach. The reported monolithic platform is an
enabling step towards hybrid nanomechanical transducers relying on the

Linial~\cite{BL} proposed analyzing objective based clustering problems under
the assumption that the optimum clustering to the objective is preserved under
small multiplicative perturbations to distances between points. The hope is
that by exploiting the structure in such instances, one can overcome worst case
hardness results.
  In this paper, we provide several results within this framework. For
center-based objectives, we present an algorithm that can optimally cluster
instances resilient to perturbations of factor $(1 + \sqrt{2})$, solving an
open problem of Awasthi et al.~\cite{ABS10}. For $k$-median, a center-based
objective of special interest, we additionally give algorithms for a more
relaxed assumption in which we allow the optimal solution to change in a small
$\epsilon$ fraction of the points after perturbation. We give the first bounds
known for $k$-median under this more realistic and more general assumption. We
also provide positive results for min-sum clustering which is typically a
harder objective than center-based objectives from approximability standpoint.
Our algorithms are based on new linkage criteria that may be of independent
interest.
  Additionally, we give sublinear-time algorithms, showing algorithms that can
return an implicit clustering from only access to a small random sample.

building blocks and evaluate von Neumann entropy to quantify the ground states.
The mean-field phase boundaries are found to remain largely intact, yet the
ground states show fragmented and entangled behaviors within large parameter
spaces of interspecies spin-exchange and singlet-pairing interactions.

of interest in recent years and represents an exciting direction for potential
growth in statistics. Despite the already substantial amount of work done in
this area to date by researchers from various disciplines, however, there
remain many questions of a decidedly foundational nature - natural analogues of
standard questions already posed and addressed in more classical areas of
statistics - that have yet to even be posed, much less addressed. Here we raise
and consider one such question in connection with network modeling.
Specifically, we ask, ""Given an observed network, what is the sample size?""
Using simple, illustrative examples from the class of exponential random graph
models, we show that the answer to this question can very much depend on basic
properties of the networks expected under the model, as the number of vertices
$n_V$ in the network grows. In particular, adopting the (asymptotic) scaling of
the variance of the maximum likelihood parameter estimates as a notion of
effective sample size ($n_{\mathrm{eff}}$), we show that when modeling the
overall propensity to have ties and the propensity to reciprocate ties, whether
the networks are sparse or not under the model (i.e., having a constant or an
increasing number of ties per vertex, respectively) is sufficient to yield an
order of magnitude difference in $n_{\mathrm{eff}}$, from $O(n_V)$ to
$O(n^2_V)$. In addition, we report simulation study results that suggest
similar properties for models for triadic (friend-of-a-friend) effects. We then
explore some practical implications of this result, using both simulation and
data on food-sharing from Lamalera, Indonesia.

compute the bisimilarity equivalence classes of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
DAGs are commonly used to model data in a wide variety of practical
applications, ranging from XML documents and data provenance models, to web
taxonomies and scientific workflows. In the study of efficient reasoning over
massive graphs, the notion of node bisimilarity plays a central role. For
example, grouping together bisimilar nodes in an XML data set is the first step
in many sophisticated approaches to building indexing data structures for
efficient XPath query evaluation. To date, however, only internal-memory
bisimulation algorithms have been investigated. As the size of real-world DAG
data sets often exceeds available main memory, storage in external memory
becomes necessary. Hence, there is a practical need for an efficient approach
to computing bisimulation in external memory.
  Our general algorithm has a worst-case IO-complexity of O(Sort(|N| + |E|)),
where |N| and |E| are the numbers of nodes and edges, resp., in the data graph
and Sort(n) is the number of accesses to external memory needed to sort an
input of size n. We also study specializations of this algorithm to common
variations of bisimulation for tree-structured XML data sets. We empirically
verify efficient performance of the algorithms on graphs and XML documents
having billions of nodes and edges, and find that the algorithms can process
such graphs efficiently even when very limited internal memory is available.
The proposed algorithms are simple enough for practical implementation and use,
and open the door for further study of external-memory bisimulation algorithms.
To this end, the full open-source C++ implementation has been made freely
available.

first early-type object observed by the current generation of X-ray
observatories. These data provided some surprising results, confirming partly
the theoretical predictions while simultaneously unveiling some problematic
mismatches with expectations. In this series of papers, we perform a thorough
study of zeta Puppis in X-rays, using a decade of XMM observations. Methods:
zeta Puppis was observed 18 times by XMM, totaling 1Ms in exposure. This
provides the highest-quality high-resolution X-ray spectrum of a massive star
to date, as well as a perfect dataset for studying X-ray variability in an
""archetype"" object. Results: This first paper reports on the data reduction of
this unique dataset and provides a few preliminary results. On the one hand,
the analysis of EPIC low-resolution spectra shows the star to have a remarkably
stable X-ray emission from one observation to the next. On the other hand, the
fitting by a wind model of individual line profiles recorded by RGS confirms
the wavelength dependence of the line morphology.

also pulsate, with periods substantially shorter than the period of the
fundamental radial mode. The pulsations appear to be nonradial, but
axisymmetric, with their common axis usually aligned with the axis of the

theoretical analysis suggests the existence of possible counterexamples. In
particular, one cannot exclude the blowing up of solutions in finite time even
in presence of smooth data. Here we give examples of explicit solutions of the

flow is rotating and swirling at the same time, inducing the flux to spiraling

an infinite-dimensional unknown given its noisy indirect observation is studied
in the Bayesian framework. In practice, one often considers only
finite-dimensional unknowns and investigates numerically their probabilities.
As many unknowns are function-valued, it is of interest to know whether the
estimated probabilities converge when the finite-dimensional approximations of
the unknown are refined. In this work, the generalized Bayes formula is shown
to be a powerful tool in the convergence studies. With the help of the
generalized Bayes formula, the question of convergence of the posterior
distributions is returned to the convergence of the finite-dimensional (or any
other) approximations of the unknown. The approach allows many prior
distributions while the restrictions are mainly for the noise model and the
direct theory. Three modes of convergence of posterior distributions are
considered -- weak convergence, setwise convergence and convergence in
variation. The convergence of conditional mean estimates is studied. Several
examples of applicable infinite-dimensional non-Gaussian noise models are
provided, including a generalization of the Cameron-Martin formula for certain
non-Gaussian measures. Also, the well-posedness of Bayesian statistical inverse
problems is studied.

800 MeV protons. That excess has been interpreted as evidence for the
antimuonneutrino to antielectronneutrino oscillation in the \Deltam2 range from
0.2 eV2 to 2 eV2. Such a \Deltam2 range is incompatible with the widely
accepted model of oscillations between three light neutrino species and would
require the existence of at least one light 'sterile' neutrino. In a preceding
paper, it was concluded that the estimates of standard backgrounds must be
significantly increased. In this paper, the LSND Collaboration's estimate of
the number of antielectronneutrino interactions followed by neutron capture,
and of its error, is questioned. The overall conclusion is that the

size less than the sample size, which can be analyzed by well-developed
regression techniques for such cases in a follow-up study. We provide an
iterative algorithm, called orthogonalizing subset selection (OSS), to address
computational issues in best subset regression. OSS is an EM algorithm, and
thus possesses the monotonicity property. For any sparse estimator, OSS can
improve its fit of the model by putting it as an initial point. After this
improvement, the sparsity of the estimator is kept. Another appealing feature
of OSS is that, similarly to an effective algorithm for a continuous
optimization problem, OSS can converge to the global solution to the \ell0-norm
constrained regression problem if the initial point lies in a neighborhood of
the global solution. An accelerating algorithm of OSS and its combination with
forward stepwise selection are also investigated. Simulations and a real
example are presented to evaluate the performances of the proposed methods.

$1/(k^2+m^2)^2$ and we study the bifurcation equation finding limits on the
parameter $m$ below which a satisfactory fermion mass solution is generated.
Since the coupling constant and gluon propagator are damped in the infrared,
due to the presence of a dynamical gluon mass, the major part of the chiral
breaking is only due to the confining propagator and related to the low
momentum region of the gap equation. We study the asymptotic behavior of the
gap equation containing this confinement effect and massive gluon exchange, and
find that the symmetry breaking can be approximated by an effective
four-fermion interaction generated by the confining propagator. We compute some

From a sample of 45 high mass star forming regions in three phases of

tracers to determine whether there are any trends attributable to the age of
the source. (Methods) We obtained JCMT observations of HCO+/H13CO+ J=4-3 to
trace large scale infall, and SiO J=8-7 to trace recent outflow activity. We
compare the infall and outflow detections to the evolutionary stage of the host
source (high mass protostellar objects, hypercompact HII regions and
ultracompact HII regions). We also note that the integrated intensity of SiO
varies with the full width at half maximum of the H13CO+. (Results) We find a
surprising lack of SiO detections in the middle stage (Hypercompact HII
regions), which may be due to an observational bias. When SiO is detected, we
find that the integrated intensity of the line increases with evolutionary
stage. We also note that all of the sources with infall signatures onto
Ultracompact HII regions have corresponding outflow signatures as well.

the spot covolatility of diffusion processes which are observed discretely with
additive observation noise. The eligibility of this approach to lead to an
appropriate estimation for time-varying volatilities stems from an asymptotic
equivalence of the underlying statistical model to a white noise model with
correlation and volatility processes being constant over small intervals. The
asymptotic equivalence of the continuous-time and the discrete-time experiments
are proved by a construction with linear interpolation in one direction and
local means for the other. The new estimator outperforms earlier nonparametric
approaches in the considered model. We investigate its finite sample size
characteristics in simulations and draw a comparison between the various

well as for the enrichment of the surrounding ISM. Our goal is to predict
accurate mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities. These quantities can be
compared to empirical values, thereby testing radiation-driven wind models. One
specific issue is that of the ""weak-wind problem"", where empirically derived
mass-loss rates fall orders of magnitude short of predicted values. We employ
an established Monte Carlo model and a recently suggested new line acceleration
formalism to solve the wind dynamics consistently. We provide a new grid of
mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of O stars, and compare the values
to empirical results. Our models fail to provide mass-loss rates for
main-sequence stars below a luminosity of log(L/Lsun) = 5.2, where we run into
a fundamental limit. At luminosities below this critical value there is
insufficient momentum transferred in the region below the sonic point to
kick-start the acceleration. This problem occurs at the location of the onset
of the weak-wind problem. For O dwarfs, the boundary between being able to
start a wind, and failing to do so, is at spectral type O6/O6.5. The direct
cause of this failure is a combination of the lower luminosity and a lack of Fe
V lines at the wind base. This might indicate that another mechanism is
required to provide the necessary driving to initiate the wind. For stars more
luminous than log(L/Lsun) = 5.2, our new mass-loss rates are in excellent
agreement with the mass-loss prescription by Vink et al. 2000. This implies
that the main assumption entering the method of the Vink et al. prescriptions -
i.e. that the momentum equation is not explicitly solved for - does not
compromise the reliability of the Vink et al. results for this part of
parameter space (Abridged).

Classes of inequalities introduced here can be put into a handy form of a
single non-linear inequality. An example is given of an N qubit state, which
strongly violates such an inequality, despite having no N-qubit correlations.
This surprising property might be of potential value for quantum information
tasks.

emphasis on the radiation-driven outflows from massive stars. The resulting
implications for the evolution and fate of massive stars are also discussed.
Furthermore, we relate the effects of mass loss to the angular momentum
evolution, which is particularly relevant for the production of long and soft
gamma-ray bursts. Mass-loss rates are not only a function of the metallicity,
but are also found to depend on temperature, particularly in the region of the
bi-stability jump at 21 000 Kelvin. We highlight the role of the bi-stability
jump for Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and discuss suggestions that LBVs
might be direct progenitors of supernovae. We emphasize that radiation-driven
wind studies rely heavily on the input opacity data and linelists, and that
these are thus of fundamental importance to both the mass-loss predictions
themselves, as well as to our overall understanding of the lives and deaths of
massive stars.

represent a general tool to calculate eighth-order high-temperature series for
arbitrary Heisenberg models. The results are applied to concrete systems,
namely to magnetic molecules with the geometry of the icosidodecahedron, to
frustrated square lattices, and to the pyrochlore magnets. By comparison with

$d_{z^2}$ on the Fermi surface substantially affects $T_c$ in the cuprates,
where the energy difference $\Delta E$ between the $d_{x^2-y2}$ and $d_{z^2}$

hybridization and the shape of the Fermi surface. A smaller $\Delta E$ tends to
suppress $T_c$ through a larger hybridization, whose effect supersedes the
effect of diamond-shaped (better-nested) Fermi surface. The mechanism of the
suppression of d-wave superconductivity due to $d_{z^2}$ orbital mixture is
clarified from the viewpoint of the ingredients involved in the Eliashberg
equation, i.e., the Green's functions and the form of the pairing interaction
described in the orbital representation. The conclusion remains qualitatively
the same if we take a three-orbital model that incorporates Cu 4s orbital
explicitly, where the 4s orbital is shown to have an important effect of making
the Fermi surface rounded. We have then identified the origin of the material
and lattice-structure dependence of $\Delta E$, which is shown to be determined
by the energy difference $\Delta E_d$ between the two Cu3d orbitals (primarily
governed by the apical oxygen height), and the energy difference $\Delta E_p$
between the in-plane and apical oxygens (primarily governed by the interlayer
