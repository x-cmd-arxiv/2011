enables and promote them. In the era of Internet, its various services that
include Web, e-mail, social networks, blogs, instant messaging, chats, etc. are
used in terrorism not only for communication but also for i) creation of
ideology, ii) resource gathering, iii) recruitment, indoctrination and
training, iv) creation of terror network, and v) information gathering. A major
challenge for law enforcement and intelligence agencies is efficient and
accurate gathering of relevant and growing volume of crime data. This paper
reports on use of established Na\""ive Bayesian filter for classification of
threat e-mails. Efficiency in filtering threat e-mail by use of three different
Na\""ive Bayesian filter approaches i.e. single keywords, weighted multiple
keywords and weighted multiple keywords with keyword context matching are
evaluated on a threat e-mail corpus created by extracting data from sources
that are very close to terrorism.

semi-conductor bilayer systems. In fact, it was believed that the transport
measurements can provide more direct evidences on superfluids than the
spectroscopic measurements. It is important to establish the relations between
the two kinds of measurements.
  In this paper, using quantum Heisenberg-Langevin equations, we establish such
a connection by calculating various exciton correlation functions in the
putative exciton superfluids. These correlation functions include both normal

  Greater, Lesser, Advanced, Retarded, and Time-ordered exciton Green functions
and also various two exciton correlation functions.
  We also evaluate the corresponding normal and anomalous spectral weights and
the Keldysh distribution functions.
  We stress the violations of the fluctuation and dissipation theorem among
these various exciton correlation functions in the non-equilibrium exciton
superfluids. We also explore the input-output relations between various exciton
correlation functions and those of emitted photons such as the angle resolved
photon power spectrum, phase sensitive two mode squeezing spectrum and two
photon correlations. Applications to possible superfluids in the
exciton-polariton systems are also mentioned.
  For a comparison, using conventional imaginary time formalism, we also
calculate all the exciton correlation functions in an equilibrium dissipative
exciton superfluid in the electron-electron coupled semi-conductor bilayers at
the quantum Hall regime at the total filling factor $ \nu_T= 1 $. We stress the
analogies and also important differences between the correlations functions in
the two exciton superfluid systems.

secure sketches. We derive upper bounds for the probability of false rejection
($P_{FR}$) and false acceptance ($P_{FA}$) for these systems. We use mutual
information to quantify the information leaked about a user's biometric
identity, in the scenario where one or multiple biometric enrollments of the
user are fully or partially compromised. We also quantify the probability of
successful attack ($P_{SA}$) based on the compromised information. Our analysis
reveals that fuzzy commitment and secure sketch systems have identical $P_{FR},
P_{FA}, P_{SA}$ and information leakage, but secure sketch systems have lower
storage requirements. We analyze both single-factor (keyless) and two-factor
(key-based) variants of secure biometrics, and consider the most general
scenarios in which a single user may provide noisy biometric enrollments at
several access control devices, some of which may be subsequently compromised
by an attacker. Our analysis highlights the revocability and reusability
properties of key-based systems and exposes a subtle design tradeoff between
reducing information leakage from compromised systems and preventing successful
attacks on systems whose data have not been compromised.

the appearance of towers of Kaluza-Klein particles obeying specific mass and

corrections. In this paper, using techniques developed in previous work, we
investigate the extent to which such radiative corrections deform the expected
tree-level relations between Kaluza-Klein masses and couplings. As toy models
for our analysis, we investigate a flat five-dimensional scalar \lambda\phi^4
model and a flat five-dimensional Yukawa model involving both scalars and
fermions. In each case, we identify the conditions under which the tree-level
relations are stable to one-loop order, and the situations in which radiative

Kaluza-Klein spectra therefore have the potential to distort the apparent

essential information for the classification of the signal. In many
applications the computation of the exact distance to the manifold is costly,
whereas an efficient practical solution is the approximation of the manifold
distance with the aid of a manifold grid. In this paper, we consider a setting

minimize the average error in the manifold distance estimation. Then we propose
a method for the joint discretization of multiple manifolds that represent
different signal classes, where we optimize the transformation-invariant
classification accuracy yielded by the discrete manifold representation.
Experimental results show that sampling each manifold individually by
minimizing the manifold distance estimation error outperforms baseline sampling
solutions with respect to registration and classification accuracy. Performing
an additional joint optimization on all samples improves the classification
performance further. Moreover, given a fixed total number of samples to be
selected from all manifolds, an asymmetric distribution of samples to different
manifolds depending on their geometric structures may also increase the
classification accuracy in comparison with the equal distribution of samples.

order to construct a manifold, we build a representative pattern whose
transformations accurately fit various input images. We examine two objectives
of the manifold building problem, namely, approximation and classification. For
the approximation problem, we propose a greedy method that constructs a
representative pattern by selecting analytic atoms from a continuous dictionary
manifold. We present a DC (Difference-of-Convex) optimization scheme that is
applicable to a wide range of transformation and dictionary models, and
demonstrate its application to transformation manifolds generated by rotation,
translation and anisotropic scaling of a reference pattern. Then, we generalize
this approach to a setting with multiple transformation manifolds, where each
manifold represents a different class of signals. We present an iterative
multiple manifold building algorithm such that the classification accuracy is
promoted in the learning of the representative patterns. Experimental results
suggest that the proposed methods yield high accuracy in the approximation and
classification of data compared to some reference methods, while the invariance
to geometric transformations is achieved due to the transformation manifold
model.

revealed the existence of a circumstellar envelope (CSE) around some Cepheids.
This surrounding material is particularly interesting for two reasons: it could
have an impact on the distance estimates and could be linked to a past or
on-going mass loss. The use of Baade-Wesselink methods for independent distance
determinations could be significantly biased by the presence of these
envelopes. Although their observations are difficult because of the high
contrast between the photosphere of the star and the CSE, several observation
techniques have the potential to improve our knowledge about their physical
properties. In this thesis, I discuss in particular high angular resolution
techniques that I applied to the study of several bright Galactic Cepheids.
First, I used adaptive optic observations with NACO of the Cepheid RS Puppis,
in order to deduce the flux ratio between the CSE and the photosphere of the
star. In addition, I could carry out a statistical study of the speckle noise
and inspect a possible asymmetry. Secondly, I analysed VISIR data to study the
spectral energy distribution of a sample of Cepheids. These diffraction-limited
images enabled me to carry out an accurate photometry in the N band and to
detect an IR excess linked to the presence of a circumstellar component. On the
other hand, applying a Fourier analysis I showed that some components are
resolved. I then explored the K' band with the recombination instrument FLUOR
for some bright Cepheids. Thanks to new set of data of Y Oph, I improved the
study of its circumstellar envelope, using a ring-like model for the CSE. For
two other Cepheids, U Vul and S Sge, I applied the interferometric
Baade-Wesselink method in order to estimate their distance.

sample access to an unknown k-modal distribution $p$,
  Testing identity to a known or unknown distribution:
  1. Determine whether $p = q$ (for an explicitly given k-modal distribution
$q$) versus $p$ is $\eps$-far from $q$;
  2. Determine whether $p=q$ (where $q$ is available via sample access) versus
$p$ is $\eps$-far from $q$;

transform various distribution testing problems for k-modal distributions over

unrestricted distributions over a much smaller domain $\{1,\dots,\ell\}$ where
$\ell = O(k \log n).$

achieved by linearizing with respect to $k$ the spectrum of a weighted interior
Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) operator for the Helmholtz equation. Approximations
$\hat{k}_j$ to the square-roots $k_j$ of all O(N) eigenvalues lying in $[k -

variant with eigenvalue error scaling empirically as $O(\epsilon^5)$ and
eigenfunction error as $O(\epsilon^3)$, the former improving upon the 'scaling
method' of Vergini--Saraceno. For planar domains ($d=2$), with an assumption of
absence of spectral concentration, we also prove rigorous error bounds that are
close to those numerically observed. For $d=2$ we compute robustly the spectrum
of the NtD operator via potential theory, Nystr\""{o}m discretization, and the

We develop the approach of Druskin, Greenbaum and Knizhnerman (1998) and
interpret the sought-after vector as the value of a vector function satisfying
the linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) whose coefficients
form the given matrix. The residual is then defined with respect to the
initial-value problem for this ODE system. The residual introduced in this way
can be seen as a backward error. We show how the residual can be computed

This diversity is used, for example, to distinguish neurons in the brain of the

generated by multiple recombination events. First, we describe the set of
sequences that can in principle be generated by multiple inversions operating
on the given initial sequence. We call this description the ergodicity theorem.
On the basis of this description we calculate the number of sequences that can
be generated from an initial sequence. This number of sequences is
experimentally testable. Second, we demonstrate that after a large number of
random inversions every sequence that can be generated is generated with equal
probability. Lastly, we derive the equations for the probability to find a
sequence as a function of time in the limit when excisions are much less
frequent than inversions, such as in shufflon sequences.

bone resorption and bone formation. This coordination is achieved by a network
of autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules between cells of the osteoclast
lineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of
signalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of
experimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper
understanding of complex bone diseases. In this paper, we further develop a
mathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to
include the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This
inclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to
play an important role in anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased
rate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of
proliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone
mass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new
model to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt
signalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells
by transforming growth factor \beta. Finally, we illustrate the power of the
new model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to
bone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to
release some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone
remodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal
signalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to
either bone gain or bone loss. We demonstrate that the new computational model
developed here is capable of capturing some key observations made on the
evolution of the bone mass due to metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone
microenvironment

significantly reduced by the UVB, whereas the local stellar radiation does not
affect them very much except in the low-mass halos. This is because clumpy
high-density clouds near young star clusters effectively absorb most of the
ionizing photons from young stars. We also find that the UVB model with a
simple density threshold for self-shielding effect can reproduce the observed
column density distribution function of DLAs and LLSs very well, and we
validate this model by direct radiative transfer calculations of stellar
radiation and UVB with high angular resolution. We show that, with a
self-shielding treatment, the DLAs have an extended distribution around
star-forming regions typically on ~ 10-30 kpc scales, and LLSs are surrounding
DLAs on ~ 30-60 kpc scales. Our simulations suggest that the median properties

epitaxial growth on a suitable substrate. Growth condition optimization usually
requires an atomistic level understanding of the growth mechanism. In this
article, we perform a mechanistic study about graphene growth on Ir(111)
surface by combining first principles calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo
(kMC) simulations. Small carbon clusters on the Ir surface are checked first.
On terraces, arching chain configurations are favorable in energy and they are
also of relatively high mobilities. At steps, some magic two-dimensional
compact structures are identified, which show clear relevance to the nucleation
process. Attachment of carbon species to a graphene edge is then studied. Due
to the effect of substrate, at some edge sites, atomic carbon attachment
becomes thermodynamically unfavorable. Graphene growth at these difficult sites
has to proceed via cluster attachment, which is the growth rate determining
step. Based on such an inhomogeneous growth picture, kMC simulations are made
possible by successfully separating different timescales, and they well
reproduce the experimentally observed nonlinear kinetics. Different growth
rates and nonlinear behaviors are predicted for different graphene
orientations, which is consistent with available experimental results.
Importantly, as a phenomenon originated from lattice mismatch, inhomogeneity
revealed in this case is expected to be quite universal and it should also make
important roles in many other hetero-epitaxial systems.

nanocavity is investigated based on finite-difference time domain algorithm.
This method includes both real and virtual photon effects and can be applied
for dipoles with different transition frequencies in both weak and strong
coupling regimes. Numerical validations have been made for dipoles in vacuum
and in an ideal planar microcavity. For dipoles located in photonic crystal
nanocavity, it is found that the cooperative decay parameters and the
dipole-dipole interaction potential strongly depend on the following four
factors: the atomic position, the atomic transition frequency, the resonance
frequency, and the cavity quality factor. Properly arranging the positions of
the two atoms, we can acquire equal value of the cooperative decay parameters
and the local coupling strength. Large cooperative decay parameters can be
achieved when transition frequency is equal to the resonance frequency. For
transition frequency varying in a domain of the cavity linewidth around the
resonance frequency, dipole-dipole interaction potential changes continuously
from attractive to repulsive case. Larger value and sharper change of
cooperative parameters and dipole-dipole interaction can be obtained for higher
quality factor. Our results provide some manipulative approaches for
dipole-dipole interaction with potential application in various fields such as
quantum computation and quantum information processing based on solid state

are represented by self-adjoint operators. However, not all of the self-adjoint

criterion to distinguish measurable quantities. Any measurable quantity must
obey the superselection rules. By contraposition, any quantity which does not
obey the superselection rules cannot be measured. Although some of
superselection rules were proved, the raizon d'\^etre of the superselection
rules has been still obscure. In this paper we deduce the superselection rules
from an assumption on symmetry property of measurement process. We introduce
the notion of covariant indicator, which is a macroscopic observable whose
value indicates the value of a microscopic object observable. We prove that if
an object system has a quantity that is conserved during the measurement
process, other quantities that do not commute with the conserved quantity are
non-measurable by the covariant indicator. Our derivation of superselection

organisms, often exhibit intrinsic temperature compensation; the period of
circadian oscillators is maintained constant over a range of physiological
temperatures, despite the expected Arrhenius form for the reaction coefficient.
Observations have shown that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the
temperature but the period does not---this suggests that although not every
reaction step is temperature independent, the total system comprising several
reactions still exhibits compensation. We present a general mechanism for such
temperature compensation. Consider a system with multiple activation energy
barriers for reactions, with a common enzyme shared across several reaction
steps with a higher activation energy. These reaction steps rate-limit the
cycle if the temperature is not high. If the total abundance of the enzyme is
limited, the amount of free enzyme available to catalyze a specific reaction
decreases as more substrates bind to common enzyme. We show that this change in
free enzyme abundance compensate for the Arrhenius-type temperature dependence
of the reaction coefficient. Taking the example of circadian clocks with
cyanobacterial proteins KaiABC consisting of several phosphorylation sites, we
show that this temperature compensation mechanisms is indeed valid.
Specifically, if the activation energy for phosphorylation is larger than that
for dephosphorylation, competition for KaiA shared among the phosphorylation
reactions leads to temperature compensation. Moreover, taking a simpler model,
we demonstrate the generality of the proposed compensation mechanism,
suggesting relevance not only to circadian clocks but to other (bio)chemical
oscillators as well.

the isoptic property (i.e., all triad circles are visible from the limit point
at the same angle). Furthermore, the limit point can be viewed as a
generalization of a circumcenter. It also has properties similar to those of
the isodynamic point of a triangle. We also characterize the limit point as the
unique point for which the pedal quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Continuing
to study the pedal properties with respect to a quadrilateral, we show that for

such that its pedal consists of four points on line, which we call the Simson

the occurrence of stress events. Adopting a topological approach we are able to
address the role that network structures play in the spread of shocks and
conversely, the effectiveness of stress events and its impact on the structure
of the networks. Here, from series of interbank liabilities and claims over
different time periods, we have developed networks of positions (net claims)
between countries. Besides the Minimal Spanning Tree analysis of the
time-constrained networks, a coefficient of residuality is defined to capture
the structural evolution of the network of cross-border financial linkages.
Because some structural changes seem to be related to the role that countries
play in the financial context, networks of debtor and creditor countries are
also developed. Empirical results allows to relate the network structure that
emerges in the last years to the globally turbulent period that has
characterized financial systems since the latest nineties. The residuality
coefficient highlights an important modification acting in the financial
linkages across countries in the period 1997-2011, and situates the recent

been known to be well correlated with the subsequent amplitude (solar maximum).
It provides very useful information for a new solar cycle as its variation
reflects the temporal evolution of the dynamic process of solar magnetic
activities from the initial phase to the peak phase of the cycle. The
correlation coefficient between the solar maximum (Rmax) and the rising rate
({\beta}a) at {\Delta}m months after the solar minimum (Rmin) is studied and
shown to increase as the cycle progresses with an inflection point (r = 0.83)
at about {\Delta}m = 20 months. The prediction error of Rmax based on {\beta}a
is found within estimation at the 90% level of confidence and the relative
prediction error will be less than 20% when {\Delta}m \geq 20. From the above
relationship, the current cycle (24) is preliminarily predicted to peak around
October 2013 with a size of Rmax =84 \pm 33 at the 90% level of confidence.

described by an integral response model with the response time scales of about
eight and thirteen months, respectively. Compared with linear relationships,
the correlation coefficients of the flare parameters with Rz, of aa with the
flare parameters, and of aa with Rz based on this model have increased about
6%, 17%, and 47% on average, respectively. The time delays of the flare

here that several properties of quasisymmetric plasmas also apply directly or
with only minor modification to the larger class of omnigenous plasmas. For
example, concise expressions exist for the flow and current, closely resembling
those for a tokamak, and these expressions are explicit in that no magnetic
differential equations remain. A helicity (M,N) can be defined for any
omnigenous field, based on the topology by which |B| contours close on a flux
surface, generalizing the helicity associated with quasisymmetric fields. For
generalized quasi-poloidal symmetry (M=0), the bootstrap current vanishes,
which may yield desirable equilibrium and stability properties. A concise
expression is derived for the radial electric field in any omnigenous plasma
that is not quasisymmetric. The fact that tokamak-like analytical calculations
are possible in omnigenous plasmas despite their fully-3D magnetic spectrum
makes these configurations useful for gaining insight and benchmarking codes. A
construction is given to produce omnigenous B(theta, zeta) patterns with

for those sites with larger bond shortening, indicating that the defect-induced

defect and divacancies) N prefers a site in the pentagonal ring. The effect of
native point defects on N dopants is quite strong: While the N doping is
endothermic in defect-free graphene, it becomes exothermic for defective
graphene. Our results imply that the native point defect and N dopant attract
each other, i.e., cooperative effect, which means that substitutional N dopants
would increase the probability of point defect generation and vice versa. Our
findings are supported by recent experimental studies on the N doping of

  application to functional MRI","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1103.3532",,,,"stat.AP cs.CV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parallel MRI is a fast imaging technique that enables the acquisition of
highly resolved images in space or/and in time. The performance of parallel
imaging strongly depends on the reconstruction algorithm, which can proceed
either in the original k-space (GRAPPA, SMASH) or in the image domain
(SENSE-like methods). To improve the performance of the widely used SENSE
algorithm, 2D- or slice-specific regularization in the wavelet domain has been
deeply investigated. In this paper, we extend this approach using 3D-wavelet
representations in order to handle all slices together and address
reconstruction artifacts which propagate across adjacent slices. The gain
induced by such extension (3D-Unconstrained Wavelet Regularized -SENSE:
3D-UWR-SENSE) is validated on anatomical image reconstruction where no temporal
acquisition is considered. Another important extension accounts for temporal
correlations that exist between successive scans in functional MRI (fMRI). In
addition to the case of 2D+t acquisition schemes addressed by some other
methods like kt-FOCUSS, our approach allows us to deal with 3D+t acquisition
schemes which are widely used in neuroimaging. The resulting 3D-UWR-SENSE and
4D-UWR-SENSE reconstruction schemes are fully unsupervised in the sense that
all regularization parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood sense on
a reference scan. The gain induced by such extensions is illustrated on both
anatomical and functional image reconstruction, and also measured in terms of
statistical sensitivity for the 4D-UWR-SENSE approach during a fast
event-related fMRI protocol. Our 4D-UWR-SENSE algorithm outperforms the SENSE
reconstruction at the subject and group levels (15 subjects) for different
contrasts of interest (eg, motor or computation tasks) and using different
parallel acceleration factors (R=2 and R=4) on 2x2x3mm3 EPI images.
