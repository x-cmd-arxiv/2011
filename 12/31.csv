based on near-threshold properties of one-body potentials. We show that
potentials with a simple global parameter allows the manipulation of the wave
function changing its spatial extent. This phenomenon seems to be fairly
general and could be implemented using current quantum-dot quantum wells
technologies and materials if a proper layered quantum dot is designed. The
layered quantum dot under consideration is similar to a quantum-dot quantum
well device, i.e. consists of a spherical core surrounded by successive layers
of different materials. The number of layers and the constituent material are
chosen to highlight the near-threshold properties.
  In particular we show that the near-threshold phenomena can be observed using
an effective mass approximation model that describes the layered quantum dot
which is consistent with actual experimental parameters.

carry out this calculation, we need the marginal pdf of an arbitrary subset of

integration of the well-known joint pdf, which is very complicated due to the
exponential factors of the joint pdf. We suggest an alternative function that
provides simpler calculation of the multiple integration. As a result, the
marginal pdf is shown to be bounded by a multivariate polynomial with a given

of better estimators of the local false discovery rate (LFDR), a probability
that the biological category has equivalent representation among the
preselected features.
  We identified three promising estimators of the LFDR for detecting
differential representation: a semiparametric estimator (SPE), a normalized
maximum likelihood estimator (NMLE), and a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE).
We found that the MLE performs at least as well as the SPE for on the order of
100 of GO categories even when the ideal number of components in its underlying
mixture model is unknown. However, the MLE is unreliable when the number of GO
categories is small compared to the number of PMM components. Thus, if the
number of categories is on the order of 10, the SPE is a more reliable LFDR
estimator. The NMLE depends not only on the data but also on a specified value
of the prior probability of differential representation. It is therefore an
appropriate LFDR estimator only when the number of GO categories is too small
for application of the other methods.
  For enrichment detection, we recommend estimating the LFDR by the MLE given
at least a medium number (~100) of GO categories, by the SPE given a small
number of GO categories (~10), and by the NMLE given a very small number (~1)
of GO categories.

understand the dynamical features arising from the vibronic structure in
non-linear spectra in a progressive fashion, starting from a microscopic model
to finally performing an inhomogenous average. We show that the discreteness of
the vibronic structure can be witnessed by probing the diagonal peaks of the
non-linear spectra by means of a relative phase shift in the waiting time
resolved signal. Moreover, we demonstrate the photon-echo and non-rephasing
paths are sensitive to different harmonics in the vibrational manifold when
static disorder is taken into account. Supported by analytical and numerical
calculations, we show that nondiagonal resonances in the 2D spectra in the
waiting time, further capture the discreteness of vibrations through a
modulation of the amplitude without any effect in the signal intrinsic
frequency. This fact generates a signal that is highly sensitive to
correlations in the static disorder of the excitonic energy albeit protected
against dephasing due to inhomogeneities of the vibrational ensemble.

event which occurred on January 2, 2008, was chosen because of several unique
characteristics. It shows upward motions for at least four hours before the
flare peak. Its speed and acceleration profiles exhibit a number of inflections
which seem to have a direct counterpart in the GOES light curves. We detect and
measure, in 3D, loops that collapse toward the erupting channel while the CME
is increasing in size and accelerates. We suggest that these collapsing loops
are our first evidence of magnetic evacuation behind the forming CME flux rope.
We report the detection of a hot structure which becomes the core of the white
light CME. We observe and measure unidirectional flows along the erupting
filament channel which may be associated with the eruption process. Finally, we
compare these observations to the predictions from the standard flare-CME model

concept is a reliable representation of the initial stages of CMEs and that
multi-viewpoint, high cadence EUV observations can be extremely useful in

for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76Ge. Such a decay, if found, would
show lepton-number violation and confirm the Majorana nature of the neutrino.
Searches for such rare events are hindered by obscuring backgrounds which must
be understood and mitigated as much as possible. A potentially important
background contribution to this and other double-beta decay experiments could
come from decays of alpha-emitting isotopes in the 232Th and 238U decay chains
on or near the surfaces of the detectors. An alpha particle emitted external to
an HPGe crystal can lose energy before entering the active region of the
detector, either in some external-bulk material or within the dead region of
the crystal. The measured energy of the event will only correspond to a partial
amount of the total kinetic energy of the alpha and might obscure the signal
from neutrinoless double-beta decay. A test stand was built and measurements
were performed to quantitatively assess this background. We present results
from these measurements and compare them to simulations using Geant4. These
results are then used to measure the alpha backgrounds in an underground
detector in situ. We also make estimates of surface contamination tolerances
for double-beta decay experiments using solid-state detectors.

Thresholding (POET) method to explore such an approximate factor structure with

factor-based covariance matrix (Fan, Fan, and Lv, 2008), the thresholding

(Cai and Liu, 2011) as specific examples. We provide mathematical insights when
the factor analysis is approximately the same as the principal component
analysis for high-dimensional data. The rates of convergence of the sparse
residual covariance matrix and the conditional sparse covariance matrix are
studied under various norms. It is shown that the impact of estimating the
unknown factors vanishes as the dimensionality increases. The uniform rates of
convergence for the unobserved factors and their factor loadings are derived.
The asymptotic results are also verified by extensive simulation studies.

algorithms for collaborative learning wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In a
large WSN, consider $n$ collaborative sensor devices distributed randomly to
acquire information and learn about a certain field. Such sensors have less
power, small bandwidth, and short memory, and they might disappear from the
network after certain time of operations. The goal of this work is to design
efficient strategies to learn about the field by collecting sensed data from
these $n$ sensors with less computational overhead and efficient storage
encoding operations.
  In this data collection system, we propose two distributed data storage
algorithms (DSA's) to solve this problem with the means of network flooding and
connectivity among sensor devices. In the first algorithm denoted, DSA-I, it's
assumed that the total number of nodes is known for each node in the network.
We show that this algorithm is efficient in terms of the encoding/decoding
operations. Furthermore, every node uses network flooding to disseminate its
data throughout the network using mixing time approximately O(n). In the second
algorithm denoted, DSA-II, it's assumed that the total number of nodes is not
known for each learning sensor, hence dissemination of the data does not depend
on the value of $n$. In this case we show that the encoding operations take
$O(C\mu^2)$, where $\mu$ is the mean degree of the network graph and $C$ is a
system parameter. Performance of these two algorithms match the derived
theoretical results. Finally, we show how to deploy these algorithms for
monitoring and measuring certain phenomenons in American-made camp tents
located in Minna field in south-east side of Makkah.

predict that the [Ne II] line at 12.81 {\mu}m detected in young stellar objects
with Spitzer traces disk gas and its response to high energy radiation, but
such [Ne II] emission may also originate in shocks within powerful outflows. To
distinguish between these potential origins for mid-infrared [Ne II] emission
and to constrain disk models, we observed 32 young stellar objects using the
high resolution (R~30000) mid-infrared spectrograph VISIR at the VLT. We
detected the 12.81 {\mu}m [Ne II] line in 12 objects, tripling the number of
detections of this line in young stellar objects with high spatial and spectral
resolution spectrographs. We obtain the following main results: a) In Class I
objects the [Ne II] emission observed from Spitzer is mainly due to gas at a
distance of more than 20-40 AU from the star, where neon is, most likely,
ionized by shocks due to protostellar outflows. b) In transition and
pre-transition disks, most of the emission is confined to the inner disk,
within 20-40 AU from the central star. c) Detailed analysis of line profiles
indicates that, in transition and pre-transition disks, the line is slightly
blue-shifted (2-12 km s{^-1}) with respect to the stellar velocity, and the
line width is directly correlated with the disk inclination, as expected if the
emission is due to a disk wind. d) Models of EUV/X-ray irradiated disks
reproduce well the observed relation between the line width and the disk
inclination, but underestimate the blue-shift of the line.

dynamical quantum systems of interacting spins-1/2, one of which is integrable
and the other chaotic. Our approach to identifying the emergence of chaos is
based on the level of delocalization of the eigenstates with respect to the
energy shell, the latter being determined by the interaction strength between
particles or quasi-particles. We also discuss how the onset of chaos may be
anticipated by a careful analysis of the Hamiltonian matrices, even before
diagonalization. We find that despite differences between the two models, their
relaxation process following a quench is very similar and can be described
analytically with a theory previously developed for systems with two-body
random interactions. Our results imply that global features of statistical
relaxation depend on the degree of spread of the eigenstates within the energy
shell and may happen to both integrable and non-integrable systems.

band) and the primary power law (hard band) dominate the emission. We report a
total of 15 out of 32 sources displaying a high frequency soft lag in their
light curves. All 15 are at a significance level exceeding 97 per cent and 11
are at a level exceeding 99 per cent. Of these soft lags, 7 have not been
previously reported in the literature, thus this work significantly increases
the number of known sources with a soft/negative lag. The characteristic
time-scales of the soft/negative lag are relatively short (with typical
frequencies and amplitudes of \nu\sim 0.07-4 \times 10^{-3} Hz and \tau\sim
10-600 s, respectively), and show a highly significant (\gsim 4\sigma)
correlation with the black hole mass. The measured correlations indicate that
soft lags are systematically shifted to lower frequencies and higher absolute
amplitudes as the mass of the source increases. To first approximation, all the
sources in the sample are consistent with having similar mass-scaled lag
properties. These results strongly suggest the existence of a mass-scaling law
for the soft/negative lag, that holds for AGN spanning a large range of masses
(about 2.5 orders of magnitude), thus supporting the idea that soft lags
originate in the innermost regions of AGN and are powerful tools for testing

anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each
cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can

whole cluster. We consider an emergent situation that one of the mobile cluster
heads is broken down, and hence the whole cluster is consequently out of work.
An efficient approach is proposed for recovering the failure cluster by
selecting multiple static sensor nodes as the cluster heads to collect packets
and transmit them to the sink node. Improved simulated annealing algorithm is
utilized to achieve the uniform deployment of the cluster heads. The new
cluster heads are dynamically changed in order to keep balanced energy
consumption. Among the new cluster heads, packets are transmitted through
multi-hop forwarding path which is cost-lowest path found by Dijkstra's
algorithm. A balanced energy consumption model is provided to help find the
cost-lowest path and prolong the lifetime of the network. The forwarding path
is updated dynamically according to the cost of the path and residual energy of
the node in that path. The experimental results show that the failure cluster
is recovered and the lifetime of the cluster is prolonged.

synchronously exhibit scale-free and modular structure, and it is thus of great
importance to uncover the effects of these two striking properties on various
dynamical processes occurring on such networks. In this paper, we examine two
cases of random walks performed on a class of modular scale-free networks with
multiple traps located at several given nodes. We first derive a formula of the
mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a general network, which is the mean of the
expected time to absorption originating from a specific node, averaged over all
non-trap starting nodes. Although the computation is complex, the expression of
the formula is exact; moreover, the computational approach and procedure are
independent of the number and position of the traps. We then determine
analytically the MFPT for the two random walks being considered. The obtained
analytical results are in complete agreement with the numerical ones. Our
results show that the number and location of traps play an important role in
the behavior of the MFPT, since for both cases the MFPT grows as a power-law
function of the number of nodes, but their exponents are quite different. We
demonstrate that the root of the difference in the behavior of MFPT is
attributed to the modular and scale-free topologies of the networks. This work
can deepen the understanding of diffusion on networks with modular and
scale-free architecture and motivate relevant studies for random walks running
on complex random networks with multiple traps.

a nonlocal Coulomb type energy. We focus on the regime where one of the phases

our results is that minimizers (or almost minimizers) of the energy have
droplets which are almost all asymptotically round, have the same radius and

analysis of the sharp interface version of the energy, with the connection to

on a scalar outcome in the presence of very many controls. Our setting is a
partially linear model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic
disturbances. Our analysis allows the number of controls to be much larger than
the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model
to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding
factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by conditioning
on a relatively small number of controls whose identities are unknown. The
latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by
selecting approximately the right set of controls. We develop a novel
estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in
this setting, called the ""post-double-selection"" method. Our results apply to
Lasso-type methods used for covariate selection as well as to any other model
selection method that is able to find a sparse model with good approximation
properties.
  The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect
selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid
uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model
selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases
with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus our method resolves the problem of
uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of
models. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical
simulations and an application to the effect of abortion on crime rates.

that each output depends on all inputs (coarse-grained dependencies).
Furthermore, it does not model the internal state of a module, which can change
between repeated executions. In practice, however, an output may depend on only
a small subset of the inputs (fine-grained dependencies) as well as on the
internal state of the module. We present a novel provenance framework that
marries database-style and workflow-style provenance, by using Pig Latin to
expose the functionality of modules, thus capturing internal state and
fine-grained dependencies. A critical ingredient in our solution is the use of
a novel form of provenance graph that models module invocations and yields a
compact representation of fine-grained workflow provenance. It also enables a
number of novel graph transformation operations, allowing to choose the desired
level of granularity in provenance querying (ZoomIn and ZoomOut), and
supporting ""what-if"" workflow analytic queries. We implemented our approach in
the Lipstick system and developed a benchmark in support of a systematic
performance evaluation. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of tracking and
querying fine-grained workflow provenance.

In this paper, we take the shortest path discovery as an example to investigate
the technique issues when leveraging existing infrastructure of relational
database (RDB) in the graph data management. Based on the observation that a
variety of graph search queries can be implemented by iterative operations
including selecting frontier nodes from visited nodes, making expansion from
the selected frontier nodes, and merging the expanded nodes into the visited
ones, we introduce a relational FEM framework with three corresponding
operators to implement graph search tasks in the RDB context. We show new
features such as window function and merge statement introduced by recent SQL
standards can not only simplify the expression but also improve the performance
of the FEM framework. In addition, we propose two optimization strategies
specific to shortest path discovery inside the FEM framework. First, we take a
bi-directional set Dijkstra's algorithm in the path finding. The bi-directional
strategy can reduce the search space, and set Dijkstra's algorithm finds the
shortest path in a set-at-a-time fashion. Second, we introduce an index named
SegTable to preserve the local shortest segments, and exploit SegTable to
further improve the performance. The final extensive experimental results
illustrate our relational approach with the optimization strategies achieves
high scalability and performance.

independent and we observe a direct proportionality of the EAS size to the
primary energy. This suggests an approximately constant depth of the EAS
maximum in this energy range. This is evidence in favour of an increasing
average mass of primary particles at energies above 20 PeV. The additional
source scenario, which is a possible explanation of the 'bump' in the spectrum,
also leads to the conclusion of increasing mass of the primary cosmic rays. A

quark-gluon plasma, a hot and dense state of matter in which quarks and gluons
are not confined inside hadrons, is formed in heavy-ion collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Charm and bottom quarks have been predicted to
interact with the medium differently than the light quarks; a study of heavy
quark interactions with the medium provides an important test of theoretical
models of the quark-gluon plasma.
  The spectrum of non-photonic electrons (and positrons) is dominated by
electrons from the semileptonic decays of D and B mesons. Therefore,
non-photonic electrons serve as proxies for heavy quarks. A measurement of the
modification of the non-photonic electron spectrum in nucleus-nucleus
collisions relative to p + p collisions allows the interactions of heavy quarks
with the medium to be studied. Previous measurements indicate that
high-transverse-momentum non-photonic electrons are suppressed in Au + Au
collisions at 200 GeV (center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair) relative to p +
p collisions at the same energy. The magnitude of that suppression is larger
than was anticipated and it has been a challenge for theoretical models to
predict the in-medium energy loss of light and heavy quarks simultaneously.
  This dissertation presents the first measurement of the yield of non-photonic
electrons from open heavy-flavor decays in Cu + Cu collisions at 200 GeV and
the suppression of that yield relative to p + p collisions. A comparison of
this result to similar results for Au + Au collisions provides some indication
that the geometry of a heavy-ion collision affects the average amount of energy
loss by heavy quarks passing through the quark-gluon plasma.

in the sequence. Given an accuracy parameter Omega(n^{-1/p}) < \epsilon < 1,
the problem of estimating Fp is to estimate \norm{x}_p^p = \sum_{i \in [n]}
\abs{x(i)}^p correctly to within a relative accuracy of 1\pm \epsilon with high
constant probability in an online fashion and using as little space as
possible. The current space lower bound for this problem is Omega(n^{1-2/p}
\epsilon^{-2/p}+ n^{1-2/p}\epsilon^{-4/p}/ \log^{O(1)}(n)+ (\epsilon^{-2} +
\log (n))). The first term in the lower bound expression was proved in
\cite{B-YJKS:stoc02,cks:ccc03}, the second in \cite{wz:arxiv11} and the third
in \cite{wood:soda04}. In this note, we show an Omega(p^2 n^{1-2/p}

emit over a wide frequency range. In spite of the efforts during 40 years after
the discovery of pulsars, the mechanism of their radio emission remains to be
unknown so far. We propose a new approach to solving this problem for a subset
of pulsars with a high-frequency cutoff of the spectrum from the Pushchino
catalogue (the ""Pushchino"" sample). We provide a theoretical explanation of the
observed dependence of the high-frequency cutoff from the pulsar period. The
dependence of the cutoff position from the magnetic field is predicted. This
explanation is based on a new mechanism for electron radio emission in pulsars.
Namely, radiation occurs in the inner (polar) gap, when electrons are
accelerated in the electric field that is increasing from zero level at the
star surface. In this case acceleration of electrons passes through a maximum
and goes to zero when the electron velocity approaches the speed of light. All
the radiated power is located within the radio frequency band. The averaging of
intensity radiation over the polar cap, with some natural assumptions of the
coherence of the radiation, leads to the observed spectra. It also leads to an
acceptable estimate of the power of radio emission.

necessary part of cyclic universe evolution, only NADE can describe this
phantom phase era for cyclic universe. Considering deceleration parameter tells
us that the universe has a deceleration phase after an acceleration phase, and
NADE is able to produce a cyclic universe. Also it is found valuable to study
generalized second law of thermodynamics. Since the loop quantum correction is
taken account in high energy regime, it may not be suitable to use standard

  of Mass",,,,,"math.DG cs.CV cs.NA math.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of finding the global Riemannian center of mass of a set
of data points on a Riemannian manifold. Specifically, we investigate the
convergence of constant step-size gradient descent algorithms for solving this
problem. The challenge is that often the underlying cost function is neither
globally differentiable nor convex, and despite this one would like to have
guaranteed convergence to the global minimizer. After some necessary
preparations we state a conjecture which we argue is the best (in a sense
described) convergence condition one can hope for. The conjecture specifies
conditions on the spread of the data points, step-size range, and the location
of the initial condition (i.e., the region of convergence) of the algorithm.
These conditions depend on the topology and the curvature of the manifold and
can be conveniently described in terms of the injectivity radius and the
sectional curvatures of the manifold. For manifolds of constant nonnegative
curvature (e.g., the sphere and the rotation group in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$) we show
that the conjecture holds true (we do this by proving and using a comparison
theorem which seems to be of a different nature from the standard comparison
theorems in Riemannian geometry). For manifolds of arbitrary curvature we prove
convergence results which are weaker than the conjectured one (but still
superior over the available results). We also briefly study the effect of the
configuration of the data points on the speed of convergence.
