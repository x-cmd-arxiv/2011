situations with non-unitary evolutions in Banach spaces. We prove adiabatic
theorems with uniform gap condition (generalizing a theorem of Abou Salem),
adiabatic theorems with non-uniform gap condition (generalizing a theorem of
Kato) and qualitative as well as quantitative adiabatic theorems without gap
condition (generalizing theorems of Avron and Elgart, and Teufel).
Additionally, we give a generalized version of an adiabatic theorem of higher
order due to Nenciu. In all these adiabatic theorems the considered spectral
values need not lie on the imaginary axis and in the adiabatic theorems with
spectral gap condition and the adiabatic theorem of higher order compact
subsets of the spectrum are sufficient (in particular, these subsets need not
consist of eigenvalues). We explore the strength of the presented adiabatic
theorems in numerous examples. In particular, we show that the theorems of the
present work are more general than the previously known theorems.
  This work was finished in October 2010 and handed in as a diploma thesis at
the mathematics department of the University of Stuttgart. The more recent
results of Avron, Fraas, Graf und Grech which appeared in the meantime (in June
2011) are therefore not taken into consideration here. We point out, however,
that the theorems of the present work are more general than the corresponding
theorems of Avron, Fraas, Graf und Grech - with the exception of the adiabatic
theorem of higher order which is in no logical relation to the adiabatic
theorem of higher order of Avron, Fraas, Graf and Grech.
  We are about to gather the most important theorems of the present work in an
article and will upload it to arXiv soon.

of the youngest SB will allow us to infer the mechanisms and timescales
involved in their formation. Our work aims to find spectroscopic companions
around young stellar objects (YSO). We present a near-IR high-resolution (R ~
60000) multi-epoch radial velocity survey of 7 YSO in the star forming region
(SFR) rho-Ophiuchus. The radial velocities of each source were derived using a
two-dimensional cross-correlation function, using the zero-point established by
the Earth's atmosphere as reference. More than 14 spectral lines in the CO
(0-2) bandhead window were used in the cross-correlation against LTE
atmospheric models to compute the final results. We found that the spectra of
the protostars in our sample agree well with the predicted stellar photospheric
profiles, indicating that the radial velocities derived are indeed of stellar
nature. Three of the targets analyzed exhibit large radial velocity variations
during the three observation epochs. These objects - pending further
confirmation and orbital characteristics - may become the first evidence for
proto-spectroscopic binaries, and will provide important constraints on their
formation. Our preliminary binary fraction (BF) of ~71% (when merging our
results with those of previous studies) is in line with the notion that
multiplicity is very high at young ages and therefore a byproduct of star

designs a double-path quantum interference that eliminates the blue sideband in
addition to the carrier transition, thus excluding any heating process
involving up to one-phonon interactions. As a consequence, cooling achieves
vanishing phonon occupation up to first order in the Lamb-Dicke parameter
expansion. Underlying this scheme is a combined action of two cooling schemes
which makes the proposal very flexible under constraints of the physical
parameters such as laser intensity, detuning, or optical access, making it a
viable candidate for experimental implementation. Furthermore, it is
considerably faster than existing ground state cooling schemes. Its suitability
as a cooling scheme for several ions in a trap and three-dimensional cooling is
shown.

for computing an effective source which is finite and continuous everywhere,
and which is valid for a scalar point particle in arbitrary geodesic motion in
an arbitrary background spacetime. We explain in detail various technical and
practical considerations that underlie its use in several numerical self-force
calculations. We consider as examples the cases of a particle in a circular
orbit about Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, and also the case of a particle
following a generic time-like geodesic about a highly spinning Kerr black hole.
We provide numerical C code for computing an effective source for various
orbital configurations about Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes.

are generally ordered by click-through rate. Bidders have a valuation, which is
usually assumed to be linear in the click-through rate, a budget constraint,
and receive at most one slot per search result page (round). We study
multi-round sponsored search auctions, where the different rounds are linked
through the budget constraints of the bidders and the valuation of a bidder for
all rounds is the sum of the valuations for the individual rounds. All
mechanisms published so far either study one-round sponsored search auctions or
the setting where every round has only one slot and all slots have the same
click-through rate, which is identical to a multi-item auction.
  This paper contains the following three results: (1) We give the first
mechanism for the multi-round sponsored search problem where different slots
have different click-through rates. Our mechanism is incentive compatible in
expectation, individually rational in expectation, Pareto optimal in
expectation, and also ex-post Pareto optimal for each realized outcome. (2)
Additionally we study the combinatorial setting, where each bidder is only
interested in a subset of the rounds. We give a deterministic, incentive
compatible, individually rational, and Pareto optimal mechanism for the setting
where all slots have the same click-through rate. (3) We present an
impossibility result for auctions where bidders have diminishing marginal
valuations. Specifically, we show that even for the multi-unit (one slot per
round) setting there is no incentive compatible, individually rational, and
Pareto optimal mechanism for private diminishing marginal valuations and public
budgets.

implications for the SM and beyond. We consider some of them in the contexts of
a simple Higgs-portal dark matter (DM) model, the SM plus a real gauge-singlet
scalar field D as the DM candidate, and a couple of its variations. In the
simplest model with one Higgs doublet and three or four generations of

substantial branching ratio. If future LHC data confirm the preliminary Higgs
indications, m_D will have to exceed m_h/2. To keep the DM lighter than m_h/2,
one will need to extend the model and also satisfy constraints from DM direct
searches. The latter can be accommodated if the model provides sizable isospin
violation in the DM-nucleon interactions. We explore this in a
two-Higgs-doublet model combined with the scalar field D. This model can offer
a 125-GeV SM-like Higgs and a light DM candidate having isospin-violating
interactions with nucleons at roughly the required level, albeit with some
degree of fine-tuning.

to study the amplification of magnetic fields when a supernova blast wave
propagates into a turbulent interstellar plasma. The blast wave is driven by
injecting high pressure in the simulation domain. The interstellar magnetic
field can be amplified by two different processes, occurring in different
regions. One is facilitated by the fluid vorticity generated by the ``rippled""
shock front interacting with the background turbulence. The resulting turbulent
flow keeps amplifying the magnetic field, consistent with earlier work
\citep{Giacalone2007}. The other process is facilitated by the growth of the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the contact discontinuity between the ejecta and
the shocked medium. This can efficiently amplify the magnetic field and tends
to produce the highest magnetic field. We investigate the dependence of the
amplification on numerical parameters such as grid-cell size and on various
physical parameters. We show the magnetic field has a characteristic radial
profile that the downstream magnetic field gets progressively stronger away
from the shock. This is because the downstream magnetic field needs a finite
time to reach the efficient amplification, and will get further amplified in
the Rayleigh-Taylor region. In our simulation we do not observe a systematic
strong magnetic field within a small distance to the shock. This indicates that
if the magnetic-field amplification in supernova remnants indeed occurs near
the shock front, other processes such as three-dimensional instabilities,
plasma kinetics and/or cosmic ray effect may need to be considered to explain
the strong magnetic field in supernova remnants.

the gravitational calculation, we include the effect of a screening scale to

an arbitrary finite equation of state $w > -1$, and show that curvature
invariants turn out to be bounded, leading to the absence of strong

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 130407 (2007)], interactions between weakly bound
molecules of heavy and light fermionic atoms are described by an effective
Yukawa potential with a strength related to the heavy-light mass ratio M/m
which might lead to crystallization in a two-dimensional geometry if the mass
ratio of heavy-light fermions exceeds a certain critical value. In the present
work we do a thorough study of the quantum three-dimensional Yukawa system. For
strong interactions (equivalently, large mass ratios) the system experiences
several phase transitions as the density is increased, passing from gas to
solid and to gas phase again. Weakly interacting Yukawa particles do not
crystallize at any density. We find the minimal interaction strength at which
the crystallization happens. In terms of the two-component fermionic system,
this strength corresponds to a heavy-light mass ratio of M/m ~ 180, so that it
is impossible to realize the gas-crystal transition in a conventional bulk
system. For the Yukawa model of fermionic mixtures we also analyze the
possibility of building molecular systems with very large effective mass ratios
by confining the heavy component to a sufficiently deep optical lattice. We
show how the effective mass of the heavy component can be made arbitrarily
large by increasing the lattice depth, thus leading to a tunable effective mass
ratio that can be used to realize a molecular superlattice.

view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way
that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear}
dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for
two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance
operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold
problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can
aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.

sparse inverse covariance matrix of a zero-mean Gaussian random vector from a
set of iid samples. Note that this is also equivalent to recovering the
underlying graph structure of a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF). We
present two novel greedy approaches to solving this problem. The first
estimates the non-zero covariates of the overall inverse covariance matrix
using a series of global forward and backward greedy steps. The second
estimates the neighborhood of each node in the graph separately, again using
greedy forward and backward steps, and combines the intermediate neighborhoods
to form an overall estimate. The principal contribution of this paper is a
rigorous analysis of the sparsistency, or consistency in recovering the
sparsity pattern of the inverse covariance matrix. Surprisingly, we show that
both the local and global greedy methods learn the full structure of the model
with high probability given just $O(d\log(p))$ samples, which is a
\emph{significant} improvement over state of the art $\ell_1$-regularized
Gaussian MLE (Graphical Lasso) that requires $O(d^2\log(p))$ samples. Moreover,
the restricted eigenvalue and smoothness conditions imposed by our greedy
methods are much weaker than the strong irrepresentable conditions required by
the $\ell_1$-regularization based methods. We corroborate our results with
extensive simulations and examples, comparing our local and global greedy
methods to the $\ell_1$-regularized Gaussian MLE as well as the Neighborhood
Greedy method to that of nodewise $\ell_1$-regularized linear regression
(Neighborhood Lasso).

individuals dedicated to competing points of view. Using a model of pairwise
social influence, we study how the presence of such groups within social
networks affects the outcome and the speed of evolution of the overall opinion
on the network. Earlier work indicated that a single committed group within a
dense social network can cause the entire network to quickly adopt the group's
opinion (in times scaling logarithmically with the network size), so long as
the committed group constitutes more than about 10% of the population (with the
findings being qualitatively similar for sparse networks as well). Here we
study the more general case of opinion evolution when two groups committed to
distinct, competing opinions $A$ and $B$, and constituting fractions $p_A$ and
$p_B$ of the total population respectively, are present in the network. We show
for stylized social networks (including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs and
Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks) that the phase diagram of this system in
parameter space $(p_A,p_B)$ consists of two regions, one where two stable
steady-states coexist, and the remaining where only a single stable
steady-state exists. These two regions are separated by two fold-bifurcation
(spinodal) lines which meet tangentially and terminate at a cusp (critical
point). We provide further insights to the phase diagram and to the nature of
the underlying phase transitions by investigating the model on infinite
(mean-field limit), finite complete graphs and finite sparse networks. For the
latter case, we also derive the scaling exponent associated with the
exponential growth of switching times as a function of the distance from the

stochastic strategy spatial prisoner's dilemma game. We equip players with the
particle swarm optimization technique, and find that it may lead to highly
cooperative states even if the temptations to defect are strong. The concept of
particle swarm optimization was originally introduced within a simple model of
social dynamics that can describe the formation of a swarm, i.e., analogous to
a swarm of bees searching for a food source. Essentially, particle swarm
optimization foresees changes in the velocity profile of each player, such that
the best locations are targeted and eventually occupied. In our case, each
player keeps track of the highest payoff attained within a local topological
neighborhood and its individual highest payoff. Thus, players make use of their
own memory that keeps score of the most profitable strategy in previous
actions, as well as use of the knowledge gained by the swarm as a whole, to
find the best available strategy for themselves and the society. Following
extensive simulations of this setup, we find a significant increase in the
level of cooperation for a wide range of parameters, and also a full resolution
of the prisoner's dilemma. We also demonstrate extreme efficiency of the
optimization algorithm when dealing with environments that strongly favor the
proliferation of defection, which in turn suggests that swarming could be an
important phenomenon by means of which cooperation can be sustained even under
highly unfavorable conditions. We thus present an alternative way of
understanding the evolution of cooperative behavior and its ubiquitous presence
in nature, and we hope that this study will be inspirational for future efforts
aimed in this direction.

neutrinos from inverse seesaw with pseudo-Dirac counterparts.

deformations, which opens prospects for studying the Dirac fermions in new
regimes and for new device applications. Certain natural configurations of
strain generate large nearly uniform pseudo-magnetic fields, which have
opposite signs in the two valleys, and give rise to flat spin- and
valley-degenerate pseudo Landau levels (PLLs). Here we consider the effect of
the Coulomb interactions in strained graphene with uniform pseudo-magnetic
field. We show that the spin/valley degeneracies of the PLLs get lifted by the
interactions, giving rise to topological insulator-like states. In particular,
when a nonzero PLL is quarter- or three-quarter filled, an anomalous quantum
Hall state spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry emerges. At
half-filled PLL, weak spin-orbital interaction stabilizes
time-reversal-symmetric quantum spin-Hall state. These many-body states are
characterized by the quantized conductance and persist to a high temperature
scale set by the Coulomb interactions, which we estimate to be a few hundreds
Kelvin at moderate strain values. At fractional fillings, fractional quantum
Hall states breaking valley symmetry emerge. These results suggest a new route
to realizing robust topological insulator states in mesoscopic graphene.

prime suspect, but details still need an explanation. To this end, we study a
three-dimensional structure of oblique magnetic fields near a rotating black
hole in vacuum. It has been proposed that such a set-up can lead to efficient
acceleration when plasma is injected near a magnetic null point. We focus our
attention especially on the magnetic field in the immediate neighborhood of the
magnetic null point, which was previously shown to occur in the equatorial
plane. By employing the Line-Integral-Convolution (LIC) method, we visualize
the magnetic field lines and explore the electric lines rising out of the
equatorial plane. We show the magnetic field structure near the boundary of
ergosphere, depending on the spin of the black hole. Electric field develops a
non-vanishing component passing through the magnetic null point and ensuring
efficient acceleration of charged particles from this particular location near
horizon. We also examine the effect of translatory boost on the field lines.
Similarly to the frame-dragging by rotation, the linear motion carries field
lines along with the black hole. Position of the magnetic null point recedes
from the black hole horizon as the spin parameter increases. For the extreme
value of a=1 the null point can occur outside the ergosphere.

considerable hope that a confirmed GRB detection will be possible with the
upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), which will have a larger effective
area and better low-energy sensitivity than current-generation imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). To estimate the likelihood of such a
detection, we have developed a phenomenological model for GRB emission between
1 GeV and 1 TeV that is motivated by the high-energy GRB detections of
Fermi-LAT, and allows us to extrapolate the statistics of GRBs seen by lower
energy instruments such as the Swift-BAT and BATSE on the Compton Gamma-ray
Observatory. We show a number of statistics for detected GRBs, and describe how
the detectability of GRBs with CTA could vary based on a number of parameters,
such as the typical observation delay between the burst onset and the start of
ground observations. We also consider the possibility of using GBM on Fermi as
a finder of GRBs for rapid ground follow-up. While the uncertainty of GBM
localization is problematic, the small field-of-view for IACTs can potentially
be overcome by scanning over the GBM error region. Overall, our results
indicate that CTA should be able to detect one GRB every 20 to 30 months with
our baseline instrument model, assuming consistently rapid pursuit of GRB
alerts, and provided that spectral breaks below 100 GeV are not a common
feature of the bright GRB population. With a more optimistic instrument model,
the detection rate can be as high as 1 to 2 GRBs per year.

lost during stable mass transfer, and the criteria for stable mass transfer on
the red giant branch and in the Hertzsprung gap. These parameters separately
and together can significantly change the entire predicted population of sdBs.
Nonetheless, several different parameter sets can reproduce the observed
subpopulation of sdB + white dwarf and sdB + M dwarf binaries, which has been
used to constrain these parameters in previous studies. The period distribution
of sdB + early F dwarf binaries offers a better test of different mass transfer
scenarios for stars that fill their Roche lobes on the red giant branch.

beyond 10 AU from a central star in a nearby disk system of the Herbig Be star

of CO at incremental radii of the disk from the central star up to 50 AU, using
an adaptive optics system combined with the high-resolution infrared
spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT. The observation successfully resolved the line
emission with 0"".1 angular resolution, which is 10 AU at the distance of HD
100546. Population diagrams were constructed at each location of the disk, and
compared with the models calculated taking into account the optical depth
effect in LTE condition. The excitation temperature of CO is 400-500 K or
higher at 50 AU away from the star, where the blackbody temperature in
equilibrium with the stellar radiation drops as low as 90 K. This is
unambiguous evidence of a warm disk atmosphere far away from the central star.

difficult, owing to a drop in intensity of Ly-alpha emission in comparison with

cosmic reionization. However it is based on small datasets, often incomplete
and heterogeneous in nature. We introduce a flexible Bayesian framework, useful
to interpret such evidence. Within this framework, we implement two simple
phenomenological models: a smooth one, where the distribution of Ly-alpha is
attenuated by a factor \es with respect to z~6; a patchy one where a fraction
\ep is absorbed/non-emitted while the rest is unabsorbed. From a compilation of
39 observed z~7 galaxies we find \es=0.69+-0.12 and \ep=0.66+-0.16. The models
can be used to compute fractions of emitters above any equivalent width W. For
W>25\AA, we find X^{25}_{z=7}=0.37+-0.11 (0.14+-0.06) for galaxies fainter
(brighter) than M_{UV}=-20.25 for the patchy model, consistent with previous

Line Radio Galaxy (BLRG) Pictor A with a significance of ~5.8\sigma (TS=33.4),
based on three years of observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
detector. The three-year averaged E>0.2 GeV \gamma-ray spectrum is adequately
described by a power-law, with a photon index, \Gamma, of $2.93 \pm 0.03$ and a
resultant integrated flux of $F_{\gamma}=(5.8\pm0.7) \times 10^{-9}$ ph
cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.
  A temporal investigation of the observed \gamma-ray flux, which binned the
flux into year long intervals, reveals that the flux in the third year was 50%
higher than the three-year average flux. This observation, coupled with the
fact that this source was not detected in the first two years of {Fermi-LAT
observations, suggests variability on timescales of a year or less.
  Synchrotron Self-Compton modelling of the spectral energy distribution of a
prominent hot-spot in Pictor A's western radio lobe is performed. It is found
that the models in which the \gamma-ray emission originates within the lobes,
predicts an X-ray flux larger than that observed. Given that the X-ray emission
in the radio lobe hot-spots has been resolved with the current suite of X-ray
detectors, we suggest that the \gamma-ray emission from Pictor A originates
from within its jet, which is in agreement with other \gamma-ray loud BLRGs.
This suggestion is consistent with the evidence that the \gamma-ray flux is
variable on timescales of a year or less.

the stochastic process. The IPF variation equations allow finding the optimal
control functions, applied to both stochastic system and the IDM for joint
solution of the identification and optimal control problems, combined with
state consolidation. In this optimal dual strategy, the IPF optimum predicts
each current control action not only in terms of total functional path goal,
but also by setting for each following control action the renovated values of
this functional controllable drift and diffusion, identified during the optimal
movement, which concurrently correct this goal. The VP information invariants
allow optimal encoding of the identified dynamic model operator and control.
The introduced method of cutting off the process by applying an impulse control
estimates the cutoff information, accumulated by the process inner connections
between its states. It has shown that such a functional information measure
contains more information than the sum of Shannon entropies counted for all
process separated states, and provides information measure of Feller kernel.
Examples illustrate the procedure of solving these problems, which has been
implemented in practice. Key words: Entropy and information path functionals,
variation equations, information invariants, controllable dynamics, impulse
controls, cutting off the diffusion process, identification, cooperation,
encoding.

suggested by the frequency partition of a graph. We examine this quantity for

certain binary Shannon entropy. On a second step, with specific attention to
networks generated by dynamical processes, we investigate approximate entropy
of horizontal visibility graphs. Visibility graphs permit to naturally
associate to a network the notion of temporal correlations, therefore providing
the measure a dynamical garment. We show that approximate entropy distinguishes
visibility graphs generated by processes with different complexity. The result
probes to a greater extent these networks for the study of dynamical systems.

Boole inequalities that, as we recall, must be obeyed by collections of
sequences of normalized spin-1/2 projections onto unit vectors that belong to,
say, the plane that is orthogonal to the classical trajectory or to the three
dimensional space. Next we define the concept of being a-p for i-indexed
sequences of spin-1/2 particles: it turns out that a sequence of spin-1/2
particles is a-p if and only if the particles behave as if they had indeed been
prepared (in the usual sense) to have definite spins +1 or -1 along the axis a,
the sequence of signs being pre-determined. The a-p property is formulated in a
way abstract enough to let one generalize it and we define the concept of being
a-p and b-p. However, using our chosen Boole inequality we prove that no
particle sequence can be both a-p and b-p when a and b are not co-linear. We
next consider two modifications of Quantum Mechanics:
  - The first one by assuming both Weak Realism, the weakest form of Realism
needed to develop any main theorem in Bell's Theory, and Locality. - The second
one by assuming Weak Realism and an hypothesis that turns out to be none else
than (relativistic) Causality extended to cover as well the observable values
that make sense only if one assumes Weak Realism. In both cases we arrive at
the conclusion that in the EPRB setting where successive pairs of spin-1/2
particles are prepared in the so-called singlet state, one of these particles
sequences is both a-p and b-p and a and b are the opposite of the vectors
respectively used to project the spin of the other particle and to get the
Realism-based alternate value for a projection. Thus the usual discussions of

our study elucidates the global organization of the gene association map, in
which various modules of correlogous genes are strikingly interconnected by

exponential-family distributions on graphs, respectively. We prove the Wilks
type of theorems for some fixed and growing dimensional hypothesis testing
problems. More specifically, under two fixed dimensional null hypotheses $H_0:

show that $2[\ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) -

Chi-square distribution with the respective degrees of freedoms, $r$ and $r-1$,
as the dimension $n$ of the full parameter space goes to infinity. Here,
$\ell(\boldsymbol{\beta})$ is the log-likelihood function on the parameter
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is the MLE under the full
parameter space, and $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^0$ is the restricted MLE
under the null parameter space. For two increasing dimensional null hypotheses
$H_0: \beta_i = \beta_i^0$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$ and $H_0:

$(2[\ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) - \ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^0)]

rectilinear polygons and edges are represented by side-contact between the
corresponding polygons. A rectilinear dual is called a cartogram if the area of
each region is equal to a pre-specified weight of the corresponding vertex. The
complexity of a cartogram is determined by the maximum number of corners (or
sides) required for any polygon. In a series of papers the polygonal complexity
of such representations for maximal planar graphs has been reduced from the
initial 40 to 34, then to 12 and very recently to the currently best known 10.
Here we describe a construction with 8-sided polygons, which is optimal in
terms of polygonal complexity as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necessary.
Specifically, we show how to compute the combinatorial structure and how to
refine the representation into an area-universal rectangular layout in linear
time. The exact cartogram can be computed from the area-universal rectangular
layout with numerical iteration, or can be approximated with a hill-climbing
heuristic.
  We also describe an alternative construction for Hamiltonian maximal planar
graphs, which allows us to directly compute the cartograms in linear time.
Moreover, we prove that even for Hamiltonian graphs 8-sided rectilinear
polygons are necessary, by constructing a non-trivial lower bound example. The
complexity of the cartograms can be reduced to 6 if the Hamiltonian path has
the extra property that it is one-legged, as in outer-planar graphs. Thus, we
have optimal representations (in terms of both polygonal complexity and running
time) for Hamiltonian maximal planar and maximal outer-planar graphs.

individuals depend only on their immediate neighbourhood. We call these payoffs
as localized payoffs. In this game, the payoff of each individual captures (1)
the gain from immediate neighbors, (2) the bridging benefits, and (3) the cost
to form links. This implies that the payoff of each individual can be computed
using only its single-hop neighbourhood information. Based on this simple model
of network formation, our study explores the structure of networks that form,
satisfying one or both of the properties, namely, pairwise stability and
efficiency. We analytically prove the pairwise stability of several interesting
network structures, notably, the complete bi-partite network, complete
equi-k-partite network, complete network and cycle network, under various
configurations of the model. We validate and extend these results through
extensive simulations. We characterize topologies of efficient networks by
drawing upon classical results from extremal graph theory and discover that the
Turan graph (or the complete equi-bi-partite network) is the unique efficient
network under many configurations of parameters. We examine the tradeoffs
between topologies of pairwise stable networks and efficient networks using the
notion of price of stability, which is the ratio of the sum of payoffs of the
players in an optimal pairwise stable network to that of an efficient network.
Interestingly, we find that price of stability is equal to 1 for almost all
configurations of parameters in the proposed model; and for the rest of the
configurations of the parameters, we obtain a lower bound of 0.5 on the price
of stability. This leads to another key insight of this paper: under mild
conditions, efficient networks will form when strategic individuals choose to
add or delete links based on only localized payoffs.

particular, the elastic properties of the medium have been theorized to provide
good coupling of particle energy to acoustic energy. The acoustic attenuation
length has been theorized to be several km, which could enable a sparsely
instrumented large-volume detector to search for rare signals from high-energy
astrophysical neutrinos. We simulated a hybrid optical/radio/acoustic extension
to the IceCube array, specifically intended to detect cosmogenic (GZK)
neutrinos with multiple methods simultaneously in order to achieve high
confidence in a discovered signal and to measure angular, temporal, and
spectral distributions of GZK neutrinos.
  This work motivated the design, deployment, and operation of the South Pole

acoustic attenuation length, sound speed profile, noise floor, and transient
noise sources \emph{in situ} at the South Pole. We describe the design,
performance, and results from SPATS. We measured the sound speed in the fully

waves and 1975.8 $\pm$ 8.0 m/s for shear waves. We measured the acoustic
amplitude attenuation length to be 316 $\pm$ 105 m. We measured the background
noise floor to be Gaussian and very stable on all time scales from one second

equations (BIEs) on rotationally symmetric surfaces in R^3 is presented. The
scheme uses the Fourier transform to reduce the original BIE defined on a
surface to a sequence of BIEs defined on a generating curve for the surface. It
can handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally symmetric. Nystrom
discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the generating curve. The
quadrature is a high-order Gaussian rule that is modified near the diagonal to
retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels. The reduction in
dimensionality, along with the use of high-order accurate quadratures, leads to
small linear systems that can be inverted directly via, e.g., Gaussian
elimination. This makes the scheme particularly fast in environments involving
multiple right hand sides. It is demonstrated that for BIEs associated with the
Laplace and Helmholtz equations, the kernel in the reduced equations can be
evaluated very rapidly by exploiting recursion relations for Legendre
functions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the scheme; in
particular, it is demonstrated that for a BIE associated with Laplace's
equation on a surface discretized using 320,800 points, the set-up phase of the
algorithm takes 1 minute on a standard laptop, and then solves can be executed
in 0.5 seconds.

equilibrium point having a loop or homoclinic orbit (or, alternatively, two
hyperbolic equilibrium points connected by a heteroclinic orbit), as a step
towards understanding the behavior of nearly-integrable Hamiltonians near
double resonances. We provide a constructive approach to study whether the
unstable and stable invariant manifolds of the hyperbolic point intersect
transversely along the loop, inside their common energy level. For the system
considered, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the
transversality, in terms of a Riccati equation whose solutions give the slope
of the invariant manifolds in a direction transverse to the loop. The key point
of our approach is to write the invariant manifolds in terms of generating
functions, which are solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In some
examples, we show that it is enough to analyse the phase portrait of the
Riccati equation without solving it explicitly. Finally, we consider an
analogous problem in a perturbative situation. If the invariant manifolds of
the unperturbed loop coincide, we have a problem of splitting of separatrices.
In this case, the Riccati equation is replaced by a Mel'nikov potential defined
as an integral, providing a condition for the existence of a perturbed loop and
its transversality. This is also illustrated with a concrete example.

ambient matter-energy density. The associated total internal reflection of
chameleons up to keV energies by a dense layer of material, which would occur
at grazing incidence on the mirrors of an X-ray telescope, lead to new
experimental techniques for detecting such particles. We discuss here when this
total internal reflection can happen and how it can be implemented in existing
or future state-of-the-art chameleon telescopes. Solar Chameleons would be
emitted mainly with energies below a few keV suggesting the X-ray telescope as
the basic component in chameleon telescopy. The implementation of this idea is
straightforward, but it deserves further scrutiny. It seems promising to
prepare and run a dark energy particle candidate detection experiment combining
existing equipment. For example, large volumes and strong solenoid magnetic
fields, which are not appropriate for solar axion investigations, are
attractive from the point of view of chameleon telescopy.

this provides a unique opportunity to shed more light on these important
processes. We present classification and high resolution spectra for HD 210111.
A detailed investigation of the most likely combinations of single star
components was performed. For this, composite spectra with different stellar
astrophysical parameters were calculated and compared to the observations to
find the best fitting combination. HD 210111 comprises two equal (within the
estimated errors) stars with T(eff)=7400K, logg=3.8dex, [M/H]=-1.0dex and
vsini=30km/s. This result is in line with other strict observational facts
published so far for this object. It is only the third detailed investigated
lambda Bootis type SB system, but the first one with a known IR-excess.

an abelian surface, birational to X'. The present work can be viewed as an
illustration for the presence of a plenty of non-compact co-abelian torsion
free toroidal compactifications. More precisely, it shows that all the
admissible values for the volume of a torsion free quotient of the complex
2-ball are attained by co-abelian Picard modular ones over Eisenstein numbers.
The article provides three types of infinite series of finite unramified
coverings of co-abelian, torsion free, Picard modular toroidal
compactifications over Eisenstein numbers, with infinitely increasing volumes.
The first type is supported by mutually birational members with fixed number of
cusps. The second kind is with mutually birational terms and infinitely
increasing number of cusps. The third kind of series relates mutually
non-birational toroidal compactifications with infinitely increasing number of
cusps.

agreement as to what mechanism or mechanisms describe `unconventional'
superconductors such as the heavy fermions, organics, cuprate and pnictide
families. However all superconductors, whether `conventional' or
`unconventional', exhibit the Meissner effect. I argue that there is a single
mechanism of superconductivity for all materials, that explains the Meissner
effect and differs from the conventional mechanism in several fundamental
aspects: it says that superconductivity is driven by lowering of kinetic rather
than potential energy of the charge carriers, it requires conduction by holes
rather than electrons in the normal state, and it predicts a non-homogeneous
rigid charge distribution and an electric field in the interior of
superconductors. Furthermore I argue that neither the conventional mechanism

are also present at the boundaries between two adjacent bundles. All as-grown

polarization by taking into account of detailed geometry of emission region,
rotation and modulation. The sparks activity on the polar cap leads to plasma
columns in the emission region and modulated emission. By considering
relativistic plasma bunches streaming out along the rotating dipolar field
lines as source of curvature radiation, deduced the polarization state of the
radiation field in terms of the Stokes parameters. We have simulated a set of
typical pulse profiles, and analyzed the role of viewing geometry, rotation and
modulation on the pulsar polarization profiles. Our simulations explain most of
the diverse behaviors of polarization generally found in pulsar radio profiles.
We show that both the `antisymmetric' and `symmetric' types of circular
polarization are possible within the frame work of curvature radiation. We also
show that the `kinky' nature in the polarization position angle traverses might
be due to the rotation and modulation effects. The phase lag of polarization
position angle inflection point relative to the phase of core peak also depends
up on the rotationally induced asymmetry in the curvature of source trajectory
and modulation.

  Wireless Sensor Networks",,"Information, Vol.14, No.10, pp.3261-3278, October 2011",,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multicast in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is an attractive mechanism for
delivering data to multiple receivers as it saves bandwidth. To guarantee the
security of multicast, the group key is used to encrypt and decrypt the
packages. However, providing key management services in WSNs is complicated
because sensor nodes possess limited resources of computing, storage and
communication. To address the balance between security and limited resources, a
multicast group key management protocol based on the weight-balanced 2-3 tree
is proposed to generate, distribute, and update the group key securely and
efficiently. The decentralized group key management method is employed. A
weight-balanced 2-3 key tree is formed in every subgroup. Instead of using the
conventional symmetric and non-symmetric encryption algorithms, the Maximum
Distance Separable (MDS) code technique is used to distribute the multicast key
dynamically. During the key updating, a series of adjustment rules are
summarized to keep the tree weight-balanced, where pseudo-nodes as leaves are
added to reduce the computation and communication complexity. Compared with
some other group key management protocols, our scheme shows higher superiority
on security and performance.
