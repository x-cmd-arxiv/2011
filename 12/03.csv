large-scale structure. Here we make special emphasis in the complications which
arise due to the non-Gaussian character of the galaxy and matter distribution.
In particular we investigate the advantages and limitations of the
Poisson-lognormal model and discuss how to extend this work. With the lognormal
prior using the Hamiltonian sampling technique and on scales of about 4 h^{-1}
Mpc we find that the over-dense regions are excellent reconstructed, however,
under-dense regions (void statistics) are quantitatively poorly recovered.
Contrary to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution which was shown to
over-estimate the density in the under-dense regions we obtain lower densities
than in N-body simulations. This is due to the fact that the MAP solution is
conservative whereas the full posterior yields samples which are consistent
with the prior statistics. The lognormal prior is not able to capture the full
non-linear regime at scales below ~ 10 h^{-1} Mpc for which higher order
correlations would be required to describe the matter statistics. However, we
confirm as it was recently shown in the context of Ly-alpha forest tomography
that the Poisson-lognormal model provides the correct two-point statistics (or
power-spectrum).

we show that, unlike other freeze-in scenarios discussed in the literature, the

underlying density contrast. In this paper we concentrate on the convergence
field $\kappa$ and use top-hat filter; though the techniques presented can
readily be extended to model the PDF of shear components or to include other
windows such as the compensated filter. The functional form for the underlying
PDF and bias is modelled in terms of the non-linear or the quasilinear form
depending on the smoothing angular scale. Results from other semi-analytical
models e.g. the lognormal distribution are also presented. Introducing a
reduced convergence for individual bins, we are able to show that the
tomographic PDFs and bias for each bin sample the same functional form of the
underlying PDF of density contrast but with varying variance. The joint
probability distribution of the convergence maps that correspond to two
different tomographic bins can be constructed from individual tomographic PDF
and bias. We study their dependence on cosmological parameters for source
distributions corresponding to the realistic surveys such as LSST and DES. We
briefly outline how photometric redshift information can be incorporated in our

  The core growth is not modeled as a gradual accretion of planetesimals but as
episodic impacts of large mass ratios, i.e. we study impacts of 0.02 - 1 Earth
masses onto cores of 1-15 Earth masses. Such impacts could deliver the majority
of solid matter in the giant impact regime. We focus on the thermal response of
the envelope to the energy delivery. Previous studies have shown that sudden
shut off of core accretion can dramatically speed up gas accretion. We
therefore expect that giant impacts followed by periods of very low core
accretion will result in a net increase in gas accretion rate. This study aims
at modelling such a sequence of events and to understand the reaction of the
envelope to giant impacts in more detail.
  To model this scenario, we spread the impact energy deposition over a time
that is long compared to the sound crossing time, but very short compared to
the Kelvin-Helmholtz time. The simulations are done in spherical symmetry and
assume quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium.
  Results confirm what could be inferred from previous studies: gas can be
accreted faster onto the core for the same net core growth speed while at the
same time rapid gas accretion can occur for smaller cores -- significantly
smaller than the usual critical core mass. Furthermore our simulations show,
that significant mass fractions of the envelope can be ejected by such an
impact.

emission shows evidence of steepening between GHz frequencies and the

the sky but the current data are not precise enough to accurately quantify this
from region-to-region. The emission correlated with the $H_{\alpha}$ template
shows clear evidence of deviation from a free-free spectrum. The emission can
be decomposed into a contribution from both free-free and spinning dust in the
warm ionised medium of the Galaxy. The derived free-free emissivity corresponds
to a mean electron temperature of $\sim 6000$ K, although the value depends
critically on the impact of dust absorption on the $H_{\alpha}$ intensity. The
WIM spinning dust emission has a peak emission in intensity in the range 40--50
GHz. The anomalous microwave emission associated with dust is detected at high
significance in most of the 33 fields studied. The anomalous emission
correlates well with the Finkbeiner et al. (1999) model 8 predictions (FDS8) at
94 GHz, and is well described globally by a power-law emission model with an
effective spectral index between 20 and 60 GHz of $\beta \approx -2.7$. It is
clear that attempts to explain the emission by spinning dust models require
multiple components, which presumably relates to a complex mix of emission

system's ground-state and the lowest energy excitations as well as the
thermodynamic properties of the system. Our results show that, despite
fundamental differences in the vertices topologies as compared to the
artificial square spin ice, in the triangular array the lowest energy
excitations also behave as a kind of Nambu monopoles (two opposite monopoles
connected by an energetic string). Indeed, our results suggest that the
monopoles charge value may have a universal value while the string tension
could be tuned by changing the system's geometry, probably allowing the design
of systems with different string tensions. Our Monte Carlo results suggest a
phase transition in the Ising universality class where the mean distance
between monopoles and anti-monopoles increases considerably at the critical
temperature. The differences on the vertices topologies seem to facilitate the
experimental achievement of the system's ground-state, thereby allowing a more
detailed experimental study of the system's properties.

They ionize and heat the neutral gas, and due to their strong winds, they swept
the gas up forming large HI shells. In this way, they generate a dense shell
where the physical conditions for the formation of new stars are given. The aim
of this study is to analyze the origin and evolution of the large HI shell
GS100-02-41 and its role in triggering star forming processes.To characterize
the shell and its environs, we carry out a multi-wavelength study. We analyze
he HI 21 cm line, the radio continuum, and infrared emission distributions. The
analysis of the HI data shows an expanding shell structure centred at (l, b) =
(100.6 deg, -2.04 deg) in the velocity range from -29 to -51.7 km/s.
  We infer for GS100-02-41, a kinematical distance of 2.8 +/- 0.6 kpc. Several
massive stars belonging to Cep OB1 are located in projection within the large
HI, shell boundaries. The analysis of the radio continuum and infrared data
reveal that there is no continuum counterpart of the HI shell. On the other
hand, three slightly extended radio continuum sources are observed in
projection onto the dense HI shell. From their flux density determinations we
infer that they are thermal in nature. An analysis of the HI emission
distribution in the environs of these sources shows, for each of them, a region
of low emissivity having a good morphological correlation with the ionized gas
in a velocity range similar to the one where GS100-02-41 is detected. The
origin of GS100-02-41 could have been mainly due to the action of the Cep OB1
massive stars located inside the HI shell. The obtained age difference between
the HI shell and the HII regions, together with their relative location, led us
to conclude that the ionizing stars could have been created as a consequence of
the shell evolution.

and processes. The brightest X-ray sources are typically accretion-powered
objects: active galactic nuclei and low- or high-mass X-ray binaries. Such
objects with X-ray luminosities of > 10^{37} ergs/s can now be detected
individually in nearby galaxies. The contributions from fainter discrete
sources (including cataclysmic variables, active binaries, young stellar
objects, and supernova remnants) are well correlated with the star formation
rate or stellar mass of galaxies. The study of discrete X-ray sources is
essential to our understanding of stellar evolution, dynamics, and end-products
as well as accretion physics. With the subtraction of the discrete source
contributions, one can further map out truly diffuse X-ray emission, which can
be used to trace the feedback from active galactic nuclei, as well as from
stars, both young and old, in the form of stellar winds and supernovae. The
X-ray emission efficiency, however, is only about 1% of the energy input rate
of the stellar feedback alone. The bulk of the feedback energy is most likely
gone with outflows into large-scale galactic halos. Much is yet to be
investigated to comprehend the role of such outflows in regulating the
ecosystem, hence the evolution of galaxies. Even the mechanism of the diffuse
X-ray emission remains quite uncertain. A substantial fraction of the emission
cannot arise directly from optically-thin thermal plasma, as commonly assumed,
and most likely originates in its charge exchange with neutral gas. These
uncertainties underscore our poor understanding of the feedback and its
interplay with the galaxy evolution.

simultaneously or their average, and is obviously not specific to the analysis
of kHz QPO data. It applies to the analysis of any PDS optimized in frequency
resolution and for low frequency variability or PDS containing features whose
parameters vary on short timescales, as is the case for kHz QPOs. It is
equivalent to the standard chi^2 minimization fitting when the number of PDS
fitted is large. The accuracy, reliability and superiority of the method is
demonstrated with simulations of synthetic PDS. We show that the maximum
likelihood estimates of the QPO parameters are asymptotically unbiased, and
have negligible bias when the QPO is reasonably well detected. By contrast, we
show that the standard min(chi2) fitting method gives biased parameters with
larger uncertainties. The maximum likelihood fitting method is applied to a
subset of archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data of the neutron star

towards both obscuration and host galaxy properties. Our detailed and uniform

absorption, direct power-law, reflected emission, soft excess, warm absorption,
and narrow Fe K-alpha emission properties for the entire sample. We
significantly detect O VII and O VIII edges in 52% of our sample. The strength
of these detections are strongly correlated with the neutral column density
measured in the spectrum. Among the strongest detections, X-ray grating and UV
observations, where available, indicate outflowing material. The ionized column
densities of sources with O VII and O VIII detections are clustered in a narrow
range with N$_{\rm warm} \sim 10^{21}$\,cm$^{-2}$, while sources without strong
detections have column densities of ionized gas an order of magnitude lower.
Therefore, we note that sources without strong detections likely have warm
ionized outflows present but at low column densities that are not easily probed
with current X-ray observations. Sources with strong complex absorption have a
strong soft excess, which may or may not be due to difficulties in modeling the
complex spectra of these sources. Still, the detection of a flat Gamma ~ 1 and
a strong soft excess may allow us to infer the presence of strong absorption in
low signal-to-noise AGN spectra. Additionally, we include a useful correction
from the Swift BAT luminosity to bolometric luminosity, based on a comparison
of our spectral fitting results with published spectral energy distribution
fits from 33 of our sources.

of norms of conformal martingales $X$, $Y$ in $\R^d$, $d\geq 2$. Suppose that
$Y$ is differentially subordinate to $X$. For $0<p<\infty$, what is the optimal
value of the constant $C_{p,d}$ in the inequality $$ Y_p\leq C_{p,d}X_p ?$$ We
answer this question by considering a more general related problem for
nonnegative submartingales. This enables us to study extension of the above
inequality to the case when $d>1$ is not an integer, which has further
interesting applications to stopped Bessel processes and to the behavior of
smooth functions on Euclidean domains. The inequality for conformal
martingales, which has its roots on the study of the $L^p$ norms of the
Beurling-Ahlfors singular integral operator \cite{BW}, extends a recent result
of Borichev, Janakiraman and Volberg \cite{BJV2}.

the presence of Rashba coupling is shown to indeed behave like in bilayer

former comes from real-spin conservation, in analogy with pseudospin

however, strongly suggest that it should belong to a different universality
class than ordinary percolation. Here we introduce a generalization of the
product rule that reveals the effect of non-locality on the critical behavior
of the percolation process. Precisely, pairs of unoccupied bonds are chosen
according to a probability that decays as a power-law of their Manhattan
distance, and only that bond connecting clusters whose product of their sizes
is the smallest, becomes occupied. Interestingly, our results for
two-dimensional lattices at criticality shows that the power-law exponent of
the product rule has a significant influence on the finite-size scaling
exponents for the spanning cluster, the conducting backbone, and the cutting
bonds of the system. In all three cases, we observe a continuous variation from

well-understood, their behavior in the dense limit remains mystifying. As the
packing fraction of particles increases, particle motion becomes more
collective, leading to a growing length scale and scaling properties in the
rheology as the material approaches the jamming transition. There is no
accepted microscopic description of this phenomenon. However, in recent years
it has been understood that the elasticity of simple amorphous solids is
governed by a critical point, the unjamming transition where the pressure
vanishes, and where elastic properties display scaling and a diverging length
scale. The correspondence between these two transitions is at present unclear.
Here we show that for a simple model of dense flow, which we argue captures the
essential physics near the jamming threshold, a formal analogy can be made
between the rheology of the flow and the elasticity of simple networks. This
analogy leads to a new conceptual framework to relate microscopic structure to
rheology. It enables us to define and compute numerically normal modes and a
density of states. We find striking similarities between the density of states
in flow, and that of amorphous solids near unjamming: both display a plateau
above some frequency scale \omega* ~ |z_c-z|, where z is the coordination of
the network of particles in contact, z_c = 2D where D is the spatial dimension.
However, a spectacular difference appears: the density of states in flow
displays a single mode at another frequency scale \omega_{min} << \omega*

compute the gravitational potential between two open strings ending on

Formation of highly-collimated magnetic field lines in the disk+spinning BH

at 3.6 and 4.5 micron. We are able to measure the transit depths, eclipse
depths, thermal and ellipsoidal phase variations at both wavelengths. The large
amplitude phase variations, combined with the planet's previously-measured
day-side spectral energy distribution, is indicative of non-zero Bond albedo
and very poor day-night heat redistribution. The transit depths in the
mid-infrared indicate that the atmospheric opacity is greater at 3.6 than at
4.5 micron, in disagreement with model predictions, irrespective of C/O ratio.
The secondary eclipse depths are consistent with previous studies. We do not
detect ellipsoidal variations at 3.6 micron, but our parameter uncertainties
-estimated via prayer-bead Monte Carlo- keep this non-detection consistent with
model predictions. At 4.5 micron, on the other hand, we detect ellipsoidal
variations that are much stronger than predicted. If interpreted as a geometric
effect due to the planet's elongated shape, these variations imply a 3:2 ratio
for the planet's longest:shortest axes and a relatively bright day-night
terminator. If we instead presume that the 4.5 micron ellipsoidal variations
are due to uncorrected systematic noise and we fix the amplitude of the
variations to zero, the best fit 4.5 micron transit depth becomes commensurate
with the 3.6 micron depth, within the uncertainties. The relative transit
depths are then consistent with a Solar composition and short scale height at
the terminator. Assuming zero ellipsoidal variations also yields a much deeper
4.5 micron eclipse depth, consistent with a Solar composition and modest
temperature inversion. We suggest future observations that could distinguish
between these two scenarios.

find that close and slow encounters between planetesimals and a planet
primarily occur with the outermost and not innermost planet. Taking care to
consider where a planet orbit crossing binary planetesimal would first be
tidally disrupted, we estimate the probability of both tidal disruption and
irregular satellite capture. We estimate that the probability that the
secondary of a binary planetesimal is captured and becomes an irregular
satellite about a Neptune mass outer planet is about 1/100 for binaries with
masses and separations similar to transneptunian planetesimal binaries. If
young exoplanetary debris disks host a binary planetesimal population then
outwards migrating outer planets should host captured irregular satellite

discovered thanks to photometric data secured with the CoRoT satellite,
combined with spectroscopic radial velocity (RV) measurements. A photometric
search for possible background eclipsing binaries conducted at CFHT and OGS
concluded with a very low risk of false positives. The usual techniques of
combining RV and transit data simultaneously were used to derive stellar and
planetary parameters. The planet has a mass of Mp = 2.8 \pm 0.3 MJup, a radius
of Rpl = 1.05 \pm 0.13 RJup, a density of \approx 3 g cm-3. RV data also
clearly reveal a non zero eccentricity of e = 0.16 \pm 0.02. The planet orbits
a mature G0 main sequence star of V =15.5 mag, with a mass M\star = 1.14 \pm
0.08 M\odot, a radius R\star = 1. 61 \pm 0.18 R\odot and quasi-solar
abundances. The age of the system is evaluated to be 7 Gyr, not far from the
transition to subgiant, in agreement with the rather large stellar radius. The
two features of a significant eccentricity of the orbit and of a fairly high
density are fairly uncommon for a hot Jupiter. The high density is, however,
consistent with a model of contraction of a planet at this mass, given the age
of the system. On the other hand, at such an age, circularization is expected
to be completed. In fact, we show that for this planetary mass and orbital
distance, any initial eccentricity should not totally vanish after 7 Gyr, as
long as the tidal quality factor Qp is more than a few 105, a value that is the
lower bound of the usually expected range. Even if Corot-23b features a density
and an eccentricity that are atypical of a hot Jupiter, it is thus not an
enigmatic object.

(PSG) classification. We point out that the existing PSG classification is
incomplete; upon completing it, we find spin liquid states with S=1 and S=0
Majorana fermion excitations coupled to a deconfined Z2 gauge field. The
crucial observation leading us to this result is that, like space group and
time reversal symmetries, spin rotations can act projectively on the fermionic
partons; that is, a spin rotation may be realized by simultaneous SU(2) spin
and gauge rotations. We show that there are only two realizations of spin
rotations acting on fermionic partons: the familiar naive realization where
spin rotation is not accompanied by any gauge transformation, and a single type
of projective realization. We discuss the PSG classification for states with
projective spin rotations. To illustrate these results, we show that there are
four such PSGs on the two-dimensional square lattice. We study the properties
of the corresponding states, finding that one -- with gapless Fermi points --
is a stable phase beyond mean-field theory. In this phase, depending on
parameters, a small Zeeman magnetic field can open a partial gap for the
Majorana fermion excitations. Moreover, there are nearby gapped phases
supporting Z2 vortex excitations obeying non-Abelian statistics. We conclude

where such S=1 Majorana spin liquids may occur in models and in real systems.

small densities. In particular we show that the reduced translational
invariance associated to the lattice periodicity has a pivotal role in the
finite-density corrections to the universal zero-density limit.
  For a parabolic dispersion with a sharp cut-off, we provide an analytical
expression for the leading-order corrections in the whole BCS-BEC crossover.
These corrections, which stem only from the unavoidable cut-off, contribute to
the leading-order corrections to the relevant observables. In a generic lattice

laboratories for testing models of strongly interacting particles in condensed
matter physics. Currently, one of the major open questions is how to obtain the
finite temperature phase diagram of a given quantum Hamiltonian directly from
experiments. Previous work in this direction required quantum Monte Carlo
simulations to directly model the experimental situation in order to extract
quantitative information, clearly defeating the purpose of an optical lattice
emulator. Here we propose a new method that utilizes deviations from a local
fluctuation dissipation theorem to construct a finite temperature phase
diagram, for the first time, from local observables accessible by in situ
experimental observations. Our approach extends the utility of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem from thermometry to the identification of
quantum phases, associated energy scales and the quantum critical region. We
test our ideas using state-of-the-art large-scale quantum Monte Carlo
simulations of the two-dimensional Bose Hubbard model.

have been a visually bright object at maximum light (-3.5 to -5.0 mag) and
would have remained visible for over a year. The peak brightness ~ 0 magnitude
adopted by Wang et al. and others would require the RX J1713.7-3946 supernova
to have been a very subluminous supernova event similar to or fainter than
CCSNe like SN 2005cs. We also note problems connecting SN 393 with a European
record in which the Roman poet Claudian describes a visually brilliant star in
the heavens around 393 AD that could be readily seen even in midday. Although
several authors have suggested this account may be a reference to the Chinese
supernova of 393, Scorpius would not be visible near midday in March when the
Chinese first reported the 393 guest star. We review both the Chinese and Roman
accounts and calculate probable visual brightnesses for a range of supernova
subtypes and conclude that neither the Chinese nor the Roman descriptions are
easily reconciled with an expected RX J1713.7-3946 supernova brightness and

hardly affect the yield of the 1S ground state bottomonium, their effect on

smooth initial conditions, the survival probability of excited bottomonia is
reduced at low transverse momentum and increased at high transverse momentum.
The observed suppression of the excited bottomonia relative to the ground state
bottomonium by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaborations at an average

deep inelastic lepton scattering on polarized protons, and the distributions
which are measured in deeply virtual Compton scattering provide important
constraints on the fundamental quark and gluon structure of the proton. In this
talk I discuss the challenge of computing these observables from first
principles; i.e., quantum chromodynamics, itself. A key step is the
determination of the frame-independent light-front wavefunctions (LFWFs) of
hadrons -- the QCD eigensolutions which are analogs of the Schrodinger
wavefunctions of atomic physics. The lensing effects of initial-state and
final-state interactions, acting on LFWFs with different orbital angular
momentum, lead to the T-odd transversity observables such as the Sivers,
Collins, and Boer-Mulders distributions. The lensing effect also leads to
leading-twist phenomena which break leading-twist factorization, such as the
breakdown of the Lam-Tung relation in Drell-Yan reactions. A similar
rescattering mechanism also leads to diffractive deep inelastic scattering, as
well as nuclear shadowing and non-universal antishadowing. It is thus important
to distinguish ""static"" structure functions, the probability distributions
computed from the target hadron's light-front wavefunctions, versus ""dynamical""
structure functions which include the effects of initial- and final-state
rescattering. I also discuss related effects, such as the J=0 fixed pole
contribution which appears in the real part of the virtual Compton amplitude.
AdS/QCD, together with ""Light-Front Holography"", provides a simple
Lorentz-invariant color-confining approximation to QCD which is successful in
accounting for light-quark meson and baryon spectroscopy as well as hadronic
LFWFs.

synaptic information transfer whereby the amount of neurotransmitter released
upon presynaptic stimulation changes over seconds as a function of the neuronal
firing activity. While a consensus has emerged that changes of the synapse
strength are crucial to neuronal computations, their modes of expression in
vivo remain unclear. Recent experimental studies have reported that glial
cells, particularly astrocytes in the hippocampus, are able to modulate
short-term plasticity but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here,
we investigate the characteristics of short-term plasticity modulation by
astrocytes using a biophysically realistic computational model. Mean-field
analysis of the model unravels that astrocytes may mediate counterintuitive
effects. Depending on the expressed presynaptic signaling pathways, astrocytes
may globally inhibit or potentiate the synapse: the amount of released
neurotransmitter in the presence of the astrocyte is transiently smaller or
larger than in its absence. But this global effect usually coexists with the
opposite local effect on paired pulses: with release-decreasing astrocytes most
paired pulses become facilitated, while paired-pulse depression becomes
prominent under release-increasing astrocytes. Moreover, we show that the
frequency of astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ oscillations controls the effects of
the astrocyte on short-term synaptic plasticity. Our model explains several
experimental observations yet unsolved, and uncovers astrocytic
gliotransmission as a possible transient switch between short-term paired-pulse
depression and facilitation. This possibility has deep implications on the
processing of neuronal spikes and resulting information transfer at synapses.

Q/U Imaging ExperimenT-II (QUIET-II) has been proposed to detect the B-modes
using the world's largest coherent polarimeter array (2,000 channels). An
unique detection technique using QUIET's polarimeters, which is a modula-

signal. The extracted signal is free from non- polarized components and
intrinsic 1/f noise. We developed a data readout system with on-board
demodulation functions for the QUIET-II experiment. We employed a ""master""
clock strategy. This strategy guarantees phase matching between the modulation
by the polarimeters and the demodulation by ADC modules. The single master
generates all carrier clocks and distributes them to each module. The developed
electronics, clock modules, and the ADC modules fulfill requirements. Tests
with a setup similar to that of the real experiment proved that the system
works properly. The performance of all system components are validated to be
suitable for B-mode measurements.

km and 710 km respectively, average temperatures below 7000 K, displaying a
broad distribution of falling speeds with an average of 70 km/s and
accelerations largely below the effective gravity along loops. Through
estimates of the ion-neutral coupling in the blobs we show that coronal rain
acts as a tracer of the coronal magnetic field, thus supporting the
multi-strand loop scenario, and acts as a probe of the local thermodynamic
conditions in loops. We further find that the cooling in neighboring strands
occurs simultaneously in general suggesting a similar thermodynamic evolution
among strands, which can be explained by a common footpoint heating process.
Constraints for coronal heating models of loops are thus provided. Estimates of
the fraction of coronal volume with coronal rain give values between 7% and
30%. Estimates of the occurrence time of the phenomenon in loops set times
between 5 and 20 hours, implying that coronal rain may be a common phenomenon,
in agreement with the frequent observations of cool downflows in EUV lines. The
coronal mass drain rate in the form of coronal rain is estimated to be on the
order of 5x10^9 g/s, a significant quantity compared to the estimate of mass
flux into the corona from spicules.

time-reversible in the sense that the dynamics evolve backwards in time after a
transformation $\bm u \rightarrow -\bm u$ at every point in space. In practice,
reversible subgrid models reduce the numerical stability of the simulations
since the effect of the subgrid scales is no longer strictly dissipative. This
lack of stability constitutes often a criterion to reject this kind of models.
The aim of this paper is to examine whether time-reversibility can constitute a
criterion that a subgrid model has to fulfill, or has not to. Thereto we
investigate by direct numerical simulation the time-dependence of the kinetic
energy of the resolved scales when the velocity is reversed in all or part of
the lengthscales of the turbulent flow. These results are compared with results
from existing LES subgrid models. It is argued that the criterion of
time-reversibility to assess subgrid models is incompatible with the main
underlying assumption of LES.

(time-adaptive) environments. The contribution of the paper to sparsity-aware
online learning is threefold; first, a Generalized Thresholding (GT) operator,
which relates to both convex and non-convex penalty functions, is introduced.
This operator embodies, in a unified way, the majority of well-known
thresholding rules which promote sparsity. Second, a non-convexly constrained,
sparsity-promoting, online learning scheme, namely the Adaptive
Projection-based Generalized Thresholding (APGT), is developed that
incorporates the GT operator with a computational complexity that scales
linearly to the number of unknowns. Third, the novel family of partially
quasi-nonexpansive mappings is introduced as a functional analytic tool for
treating the GT operator. By building upon the rich fixed point theory, the
previous class of mappings helps us, also, to establish a link between the GT
operator and a union of linear subspaces; a non-convex object which lies at the
heart of any sparsity promoting technique, batch or online. Based on such a
functional analytic framework, a convergence analysis of the APGT is provided.
Furthermore, extensive experiments suggest that the APGT exhibits competitive
performance when compared to computationally more demanding alternatives, such
as the sparsity-promoting Affine Projection Algorithm (APA)- and Recursive
Least Squares (RLS)-based techniques.
