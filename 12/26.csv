correlated heavy fermion materials. There exist multiple energy scales in this
model corresponding to each phase of the system. Here, we study quantum phase
transition between the Kondo-singlet phase and the antiferromagnetic long-range
ordered phase, and show the effect of anisotropies in terms of quantum
information properties and vanishing energy gap. We employ the ""perturbative
continuous unitary transformations"" approach to calculate the energy gap and
spin-spin correlations for the model in the thermodynamic limit of one, two,
and three spatial dimensions as well as for spin ladders. In particular, we
show that the method, although being perturbative, can predict the expected
quantum critical point, where the gap of low-energy spectrum vanishes, which is
in good agreement with results of other numerical and Green's function
analyses. In addition, we employ concurrence, a bipartite entanglement measure,
to study the criticality of the model. Absence of singularities in the
derivative of concurrence in two and three dimensions in the Kondo-necklace
model shows that this model features multipartite entanglement. We also discuss
crossover from the one-dimensional to the two-dimensional model via the ladder
structure.

in the formation of the half-doped antiferromagnetic resonating-valence-bond

a long-range AF order in electron-doped materials, a stripe structure with the
""in-phase"" magnetic domain (IPMD) is obtained in the underdoped regime instead
of the AF-RVB stripe. The IPMD stripe with the largest period permitted by
lattice size is stabilized near the underdoped region and it excludes the
Yamada plot from electron-doped cases. Based on finite lattice size to which we

profiles in complex biological mixtures. Common methods used to assign and
estimate concentrations of metabolites involve either an expert manual peak
fitting or extra pre-processing steps, such as peak alignment and binning. Peak
fitting is very time consuming and is subject to human error. Conversely,
alignment and binning can introduce artefacts and limit immediate biological
interpretation of models. Results: We present the Bayesian AuTomated Metabolite
Analyser for NMR spectra (BATMAN), an R package which deconvolutes peaks from
1-dimensional NMR spectra, automatically assigns them to specific metabolites
from a target list and obtains concentration estimates. The Bayesian model
incorporates information on charac-teristic peak patterns of metabolites and is
able to account for shifts in the position of peaks commonly seen in NMR
spectra of biological samples. It applies a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm to sample from a joint posterior distribution of the model parameters
and obtains concentration estimates with reduced error compared with
conventional numerical integration and comparable to manual deconvolution by

interactions of multiple cells, we measure traction stresses of cohesive
colonies of 1-27 cells adherent to soft substrates. We find that traction
stresses are generally localized at the periphery of the colony and the total
traction force scales with the colony radius. For large colony sizes, the
scaling appears to approach linear, suggesting the emergence of an apparent
surface tension of order 1E-3 N/m. A simple model of the cell colony as a
contractile elastic medium coupled to the substrate captures the spatial
distribution of traction forces and the scaling of traction forces with the
colony size.

  We show that charging effects in the junction give rise to a mechanical force

oscillating components with a frequency matching the resonant frequency of the

results of a phoswich detector with a diameter of 101.6 mm consisting of 6 mm
thick LaBr3:Ce and 40 mm thick NaI(Tl), which is the largest one of this type
reported so far. The measured energy resolution is 10.6% at 60 keV, varying
inversely proportional to the square root of the energy, and the energy
nonlinearity is found to be less than 1%, as good as those of smaller
phoswiches. The coupled scintillators and phototube also show excellent
uniformity across the detecting surface, with a deviation of 0.7% on the pulse
amplitude produced by 60 keV gamma-rays. Thanks to the large ratio of light
decay times of NaI(Tl) and LaBr3:Ce, 250 ns vs. 16 ns, pulse shape
discrimination is much easier for this combination than for NaI(Tl)/CsI(Na). As
the light decay time of LaBr3:Ce is about 15 times faster than that of NaI(Tl),
this phoswich is more suitable for detection of bright, transient sources such
as gamma-ray bursts and soft gamma-ray repeaters. The internal activity of

assisted cold chemistry and novel many body studies. Due to the different
individual trapping mechanisms, trapped atoms are significantly colder than
trapped ions, therefore in the combined system, the strong binary ion$-$atom
interaction results in heat flow from ions to atoms. Conversely, trapped ions
can also get collisionally heated by the cold atoms, making the resulting
equilibrium between ions and atoms intriguing. Here we experimentally
demonstrate, Rubidium ions (Rb$^+$) cool in contact with magneto-optically
trapped (MOT) Rb atoms, contrary to the general expectation of ion heating for
equal ion and atom masses. The cooling mechanism is explained theoretically and
substantiated with numerical simulations. The importance of resonant charge
exchange (RCx) collisions, which allows swap cooling of ions with atoms,
wherein a single glancing collision event brings a fast ion to rest, is
discussed.

quantumness. We reformulate the AvR test by defining it for quantum states
rather than for observables. This allows us to identify the necessary
quantities and resources to detect quantumness for any given system. The first
quantity turns out to be the purity of the system. When applying the witness to
a system with even moderate mixedness the protocol is unable to reveal any
quantumness. We then show that having many copies of the system leads the
witness to reveal quantumness. This seems contrary to the Bohr correspondence,
which asserts that in the large number limit quantum systems become classical,
while the witness shows quantumness when several non-quantum systems, as
determined by the witness, are considered together. However, the resources
required to detect the quantumness increase dramatically with the number of
systems. We apply the quantumness witness for systems that are highly mixed but
in the large number limit, which resembles nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
systems. We make several conclusion about detecting quantumness in NMR-like

show that the dimensionless holographic parameter is very important in
characterising the DGP branches, and in determining the behaviour of the Ricci
dark energy as well as the asymptotic behaviour of the brane. On the one hand,
in the DGP scenario the Ricci dark energy will exhibit a phantom-like behaviour
with no big rip if the holographic parameter is strictly larger than 1/2. For
smaller values, the brane hits a big rip or a little rip. On the other hand, we
have shown that the introduction of the GB term avoids the big rip and little
rip singularities on both branches but cannot avoid the appearance of a big
freeze singularity for some values of the holographic parameter on the normal
branch, however, these values are very unlikely because they lead to a very
negative equation of state at the present and therefore we can speak in
practice of singularity avoidance. At this regard, the equation of state
parameter of the Ricci dark energy plays a crucial role, even more important
than the GB parameter, in rejecting the parameter space where future
singularities appear.

of a one-dimensional metal. However, for a quasi-one-dimensional metal these
correlations are suppressed, at least partially. We study conditions under
which the one-dimensional effects significantly influence the dimensional
crossover of a quasi-one-dimensional metal. It is proved (i) that even a system
with very high anisotropy of the single-particle hopping might behave on both
sides of the crossover as an ordinary weakly non-ideal Fermi gas. Further, (ii)
to demonstrate well-developed signatures of one-dimensional correlations the
system must have extremely (exponentially) high anisotropy. Between cases (i)
and (ii) an intermediate regime lies: (iii) the one-dimensional phenomena
affect the two-particle susceptibilities, but do not reveal themselves in
single-particle quantities. Unlike the normal state properties, (iv) the
ordering transition is always very sensitive to the anisotropy: the mean field
theory quickly becomes invalid as the anisotropy increases. An expression for
the transition temperature is derived. The attributes (i-iv) are used to
classify the weakly interacting quasi-one-dimensional fermion systems.
