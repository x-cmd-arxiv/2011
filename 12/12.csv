the sum of an angle in quark mixing and the corresponding angle in lepton
mixing is $\pi/4$. Experimentally in the standard PDG parametrization, two such
relations exist approximately. These QLC relations are accidental which only
manifest themselves in the PDG parametrization. We propose reparametrization
invariant expressions for the complementarity relations in terms of the
magnitude of the elements in the quark and lepton mixing matrices. In the exact
QLC limit, it is found that $|V_{us}/V_{ud}| + |V_{e2}/V_{e1}| +

frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) has attracted extensive attention.
Most of the research has dealt with the development of sub-optimal but
low-complexity algorithms. In this paper, the contributions comprise new
insights from revisiting tractability aspects of computing optimum. Previous
complexity analyses have been limited by assumptions of fixed power on each
subcarrier, or power-rate functions that locally grow arbitrarily fast. The
analysis under the former assumption does not generalize to problem
tractability with variable power, whereas the latter assumption prohibits the
result from being applicable to well-behaved power-rate functions. As the first
contribution, we overcome the previous limitations by rigorously proving the
problem's NP-hardness for the representative logarithmic rate function. Next,
we extend the proof to reach a much stronger result, namely that the problem
remains NP-hard, even if the channels allocated to each user is restricted to a
consecutive block with given size. We also prove that, under these
restrictions, there is a special case with polynomial-time tractability. Then,
we treat the problem class where the channels can be partitioned into an
arbitrarily large but constant number of groups, each having uniform gain for
every individual user. For this problem class, we present a polynomial-time
algorithm and prove optimality guarantee. In addition, we prove that the
recognition of this class is polynomial-time solvable.

where the rectangular matrix $X$ (called the standardized matrix) is obtained
by normalizing each column of the data matrix $\widetilde{X}$ by its Euclidean

correlation functions of the extreme eigenvalues (at both edges of the
spectrum) of the correlation matrix ${X}^{\dagger}X$ converge to those of the
Gaussian correlation matrix, that is, Tracy-Widom law, and, thus, in
particular, the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of ${X}^{\dagger}X$ after
appropriate centering and rescaling converge to the Tracy-Widom distribution.
The asymptotic distribution of extreme eigenvalues of the Gaussian correlation
matrix has been worked out only recently. As a corollary of the main result in
this paper, we also obtain that the extreme eigenvalues of Gaussian correlation
matrices are asymptotically distributed according to the Tracy-Widom law. The
proof is based on the comparison of Green functions, but the key obstacle to be
surmounted is the strong dependence of the entries of the correlation matrix.
We achieve this via a novel argument which involves comparing the moments of
product of the entries of the standardized data matrix to those of the raw data
matrix. Our proof strategy may be extended for proving the edge universality of
other random matrix ensembles with dependent entries and hence is of
independent interest.

times about its spin axis for every two orbits about the Sun. The current
explanation for this unique state assumes that the initial rotation of this

spin to this resonance. When core-mantle boundary friction is accounted for,
capture into the 3/2 resonance occurs with a 26% probability, but the most
probable outcome is capture into one of the higher-order resonances. Here we
show that if the initial rotation of Mercury were retrograde, this planet would
be captured into synchronous rotation with a 68% probability. Strong spatial
variations of the impact cratering rate would have existed at this time, and
these are shown to be consistent with the distribution of pre-Calorian impact
basins observed by Mariner 10 and MESSENGER. Escape from this highly stable
resonance is made possible by the momentum imparted by large basin-forming
impact events, and capture into the 3/2 resonance occurs subsequently under
favourable conditions.

Delicious datasets could be improved by 43.5%, 55.4% and 19.2% compared with
the standard heat conduction algorithm, and the diversity is also increased or
approximately unchanged. Further statistical analyses suggest that the present

black hole candidate IGR J17091-3624. This source exhibits a broad variety of
complex light curve patterns including periods of strong flares alternating
with quiet intervals. Similar patterns in the X-ray light curves have been seen
in the (up to now) unique black hole system GRS 1915+105. In the context of the
variability classes defined by Belloni et al. (2000) for GRS 1915+105, we find
that IGR J17091-3624 shows the \nu, \rho, \alpha, \lambda, \beta and \mu
classes as well as quiet periods which resemble the \chi class, all occurring
at 2-60 keV count rate levels which can be 10-50 times lower than observed in
GRS 1915+105. The so-called \rho class ""heartbeats"" occur as fast as every few
seconds and as slow as ~100 seconds, tracing a loop in the hardness-intensity
diagram which resembles that previously seen in GRS 1915+105. However, while
GRS 1915+105 traverses this loop clockwise, IGR J17091-3624 does so in the
opposite sense. We briefly discuss our findings in the context of the models

that relaxation of the oscillator is accompanied by quantum noise, which leads
to a finite-width distribution over quantum states even for T=0. The quantum
noise also leads to switching between coexisting vibrational states via
transitions over the barrier in phase space. The switching mechanism, quantum
activation, has no analog in thermal equilibrium systems. The switching rates
display characteristic scaling near bifurcation points. The power and

networks (WSNs) has been conventionally tackled by assuming battery-powered
devices and by adopting the network lifetime as the main performance criterion.
While WSNs operated by energy-harvesting (EH) devices are not limited by
network lifetime, they pose new design challenges due to the uncertain amount
of harvestable energy. Novel design criteria are thus required to capture the
trade-offs between the potentially infinite network lifetime and the uncertain
energy availability. This paper addresses the analysis and design of WSNs with
EH devices by focusing on conventional MAC protocols, namely TDMA, Framed-ALOHA
(FA) and Dynamic-FA (DFA), and by accounting for the performance trade-offs and
design issues arising due to EH. A novel metric, referred to as delivery
probability, is introduced to measure the capability of a MAC protocol to
deliver the measure of any sensor in the network to the intended destination
(or fusion center, FC). The interplay between delivery efficiency and time
efficiency (i.e., the data collection rate at the FC), is investigated
analytically using Markov models. Numerical results validate the analysis and
emphasize the critical importance of accounting for both delivery probability
and time efficiency in the design of EH-WSNs.

explicitly through electron-magnons and electron-phonons interaction, which
govern the demagnetization time scale. By properly treating the spin system in
a self-consistent random phase approximation, we derive magnetization dynamic
equations for a broad range of temperature. The dependence of demagnetization
on the temperature and pumping laser intensity is calculated in detail. In
particular, we show several salient features for understanding magnetization
dynamics near the Curie temperature. While the critical slowdown in dynamics

designed to consistently assimilate the local filtering distributions into the

large common pool of users. The latter have a reservation utility of U0 units
or, equivalently, an alternative option to satisfy their communication needs.
The operators must satisfy these minimum requirements in order to attract the
users. We model the users decisions and interaction as an evolutionary game and
the competition among the operators as a non cooperative price game which is
proved to be a potential game. For each set of prices selected by the
operators, the evolutionary game attains a different stationary point. We show
that the outcome of both games depend on the reservation utility of the users
and the amount of spectrum W the operators have at their disposal. We express
the market welfare and the revenue of the operators as functions of these two
parameters. Accordingly, we consider the scenario where a regulating agency is
able to intervene and change the outcome of the market by tuning W and/or U0.
Different regulators may have different objectives and criteria according to
which they intervene. We analyze the various possible regulation methods and
discuss their requirements, implications and impact on the market.

central aspect of multi-user Grid job environments is the necessary delegation

analysis of the ALICE Grid job model is presented with derived security
objectives, followed by a discussion of existing approaches of unrestricted
delegation based on X.509 proxy certificates and the Grid middleware gLExec.
Unrestricted delegation has severe security consequences and limitations, most
importantly allowing for identity theft and forgery of delegated assignments.
These limitations are discussed and formulated, both in general and with
respect to an adoption in line with multi-user Grid jobs. Based on the
architecture of the ALICE Grid Services, a new general model of mediated
definite delegation is developed and formulated, allowing a broker to assign
context-sensitive user privileges to agents. The model provides strong
accountability and long- term traceability. A prototype implementation allowing
for certified Grid jobs is presented including a potential interaction with
gLExec. The achieved improvements regarding system security, malicious job
exploitation, identity protection, and accountability are emphasized, followed
by a discussion of non- repudiation in the face of malicious Grid jobs.

  Collaboration","submitted to JASIST",,,,"cs.SI cs.IR physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studies on social networks highlight the importance of network structure or
structural properties of a given network and its impact on performance outcome.
One of the important properties of this network structure is referred as
""social capital"" which is the ""network of contacts"" and the associated values
attached to these networks of contacts. In this study, our aim is to provide
empirical evidence of the influence of social capital and performance within
the context of academic collaboration. We suggest that the collaborative
process involves social capital embedded within relationships and network
structures among direct co-authors. Thus, we examine whether scholars' social
capital is associated with their citation-based performance, using
co-authorship and citation data. In order to test and validate our proposed
hypotheses, we extract publication records from Scopus having ""information
science"" in their title or keywords or abstracts during 2001 and 2010. To
overcome the limitations of traditional social network metrics for measuring
the influence of scholars' social capital within their co-authorship network,
we extend the traditional social network metrics by proposing a new measure
(Power-Diversity Index). We then use Spearman's correlation rank test to
examine the association between scholars' social capital measures and their
citation-based performance. Results suggest that research performance of
authors is positively correlated with their social capital measures. This study
highlights that the Power-diversity Index, which is introduced as a new hybrid
centrality measure, serves as an indicator of power and influence of an
individual's ability to control communication and information.

multi-dimensional shifts cannot be systematically determined. This work
introduces constructive and systematic methods for verifying the degree of

irreducibility) for two-dimensional shifts of finite type. First, transition
matrices on infinite strips of width $n$ are introduced for all $n\geq 2$. To
determine the primitivity of the transition matrices, connecting operators are
introduced to reduce the order of high-order transition matrices to yield
lower-order transition matrices. Two sufficient conditions for primitivity are
provided; they are invariant diagonal cycles and primitive commutative cycles
of connecting operators. After primitivity is established, the
corner-extendability and crisscross-extendability are used to demonstrate
topological mixing. In addition, the hole-filling condition yields the strong
specification. All mentioned conditions can be verified to apply in a finite
number of steps.

fraction of the gas in high redshift rare massive halos falls nearly radially
to their very centre on extremely short timescales. This process results in the
formation of very compact bulges with specific angular momentum a factor
5-30$smaller than the average angular momentum of the baryons in the whole
halo. Such low angular momentum originates both from segregation and effective
cancellation when the gas flows to the centre of the halo along well defined
cold filamentary streams. These filaments penetrate deep inside the halo and
connect to the bulge from multiple rapidly changing directions. Structures
falling in along the filaments (satellite galaxies) or formed by gravitational
instabilities triggered by the inflow (star clusters) further reduce the
angular momentum of the gas in the bulge. Finally, the fraction of gas radially
falling to the centre appears to increase with the mass of the halo; we argue
that this is most likely due to an enhanced cancellation of angular momentum in
rarer halos which are fed by more isotropically distributed cold streams. Such
an increasingly efficient funnelling of low-angular momentum gas to the centre
of very massive halos at high redshift may account for the rapid pace at which
the most massive supermassive black holes grow to reach observed masses around
$10^9$M$_\odot$ at an epoch when the Universe is barely 1 Gyr old.

stars most likely showing extra N enrichment (5 objects). For one star (Theta1
Ori C) no robust conclusion can be drawn due to its young age. The star with no
N enrichment is the one with the weakest magnetic field, possibly of dynamo
origin. It might be a star having experienced strong magnetic braking under the
condition of solid body rotation, but its rotational velocity is still
relatively large. The five stars with high N content were probably slow
rotators on the zero age main sequence, but they have surface N/H typical of
normal O stars, indicating that the presence of a (probably fossil) magnetic
field leads to extra enrichment. These stars may have a strong differential
rotation inducing shear mixing. Our results should be viewed as a basis on

astrophysical phenomena have allowed us to infer a concordance cosmological
model that successfully accounts for most of the observations of our universe.
This has opened up the way to studies that aim to better determine the
constants of the model and confront its predictions with those of competing
scenarios. Here, we use strong gravitational lenses as cosmological probes.
Strong lensing, as opposed to weak lensing, produces multiple images of a
single source. Extracting cosmologically relevant information requires accurate
modeling of the lens mass distribution, the latter being a galaxy or a cluster.
To this purpose a variety of models are available, but it is hard to
distinguish between them, as the choice is mostly guided by the quality of the
fit to the data without accounting for the number of additional parameters
introduced. However, this is a model selection problem rather than one of
parameter fitting that we address in the Bayesian framework. Using simple test
cases, we show that the assumption of more complicate lens models may not be
justified given the level of accuracy of the data.

represent a key class of observables studied to gain informations about the QCD

tomography has turned out to be more difficult than expected initially. One of
the major obstacles in extracting reliable tomographic information from the
data is that neither the parton-medium interaction nor the medium geometry are
known with great precision, and thus a difference in model assumptions in the
hard perturbative Quantum Choromdynamics (pQCD) modelling can usually be
compensated by a corresponding change of assumptions in the soft bulk medium
sector and vice versa. The only way to overcome this problem is to study the
full systematics of combinations of parton-medium interaction and bulk medium
evolution models. This work presents a meta-analysis summarizing results from a
number of such systematical studies and discusses in detail how certain data
sets provide specific constraints for models. Combining all available
information, only a small group of models exhibiting certain characteristic
features consistent with a pQCD picture of parton-medium interaction is found
to be viable given the data. In this picture, the dominant mechanism is
medium-induced radiation combined with a surprisingly small component of
elastic energy transfer into the medium.

shown that a thresholded projection estimator can attain up to a constant
minimax-rates of convergence in a general framework which allows us to cover
the prediction problem with respect to the mean squared prediction error as
well as the estimation of the slope function and its derivatives. This
estimation procedure, however, requires an optimal choice of a tuning parameter
with regard to certain characteristics of the slope function and the covariance
operator associated with the functional regressor. As this information is
usually inaccessible in practice, we investigate a fully data-driven choice of
the tuning parameter which combines model selection and Lepski's method. It is
inspired by the recent work of Goldenshluger and Lepski [Ann. Statist. 39
(2011) 1608-1632]. The tuning parameter is selected as minimizer of a
stochastic penalized contrast function imitating Lepski's method among a random
collection of admissible values. This choice of the tuning parameter depends
only on the data and we show that within the general framework the resulting
data-driven thresholded projection estimator can attain minimax-rates up to a
constant over a variety of classes of slope functions and covariance operators.
The results are illustrated considering different configurations which cover in
particular the prediction problem as well as the estimation of the slope and
its derivatives. A simulation study shows the reasonable performance of the

G-band images obtained at various heliocentric angles with the 1-m Swedish

diffraction limit of the instrument (~0.1 arcsec). RESULTS: The FCS is largest
at disk center (~1 %), and then drops down to become 0.2 % at 'mu'= 0.3 (with
'mu' the cosine of the heliocentric angle. The relationship has large scatter,

depressions in the mean solar photosphere characterized by a depth, a width,

observations, it shows the BPs to be shallow structures (depth < width) with a
large range of inclinations. We also estimate how different parts of the solar
disk may contribute to TSI variations, finding that 90 % is contributed by BPs
having 'mu' > 0.5, and half of it is due to BPs with 'mu' > 0.8.

significance tests in research assessments as has recently been suggested in
the debate about proper normalization procedures for citation indicators.
Statistical significance tests are highly controversial and numerous criticisms
have been leveled against their use. Based on examples from articles by
proponents of the use statistical significance tests in research assessments,
we address some of the numerous problems with such tests. The issues
specifically discussed are the ritual practice of such tests, their dichotomous
application in decision making, the difference between statistical and
substantive significance, the implausibility of most null hypotheses, the
crucial assumption of randomness, as well as the utility of standard errors and
confidence intervals for inferential purposes. We argue that applying
statistical significance tests and mechanically adhering to their results is
highly problematic and detrimental to critical thinking. We claim that the use
of such tests do not provide any advantages in relation to citation indicators,
interpretations of them, or the decision making processes based upon them. On
the contrary their use may be harmful. Like many other critics, we generally
believe that statistical significance tests are over- and misused in the social
sciences including scientometrics and we encourage a reform on these matters.

latter producing jets that will interact with the stellar wind. The evolution
of the jets, and ultimately their radiative outcome, could depend strongly on
the inhomogeneity of the wind, which calls for a detailed study. The
hydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,
focusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,
using the code \textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a
clumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual
clumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling
factors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as
clumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the
system. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach
the borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,
although with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter
into the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their
size divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump. Then, clumps quickly
disrupt, mass-loading and slowing down the jet. We conclude that moderate wind
clumpiness makes already a strong difference with the homogeneous wind case,
enhancing jet disruption, mass-loading, bending, and likely energy dissipation
in the form of emission. All this can have observational consequences at
high-energies and also in the large scale radio jets.

while the center of mass energy of collisions of particles near the event
horizon of a blackhole is not significantly larger than the rest mass of the
interacting particles, in an analogous situation, it could be arbitrarily large
in the JNWspacetime near the naked singularity. The high energy collisions are
seen to be generic in the presence of a photon sphere in the JNW spacetime,
whereas an extreme fine-tuning of the angular momentum of the colliding
particles is required when the photon sphere is absent. The center of mass
energy of collision near the singularity grows slowly for small and extremely
large deviations from the Schwarzschild blackhole, but for intermediate
strengths of the scalar field it rises moderately fast. As a possible and
potentially interesting application, we point out that the presence of such

into interaction, they can equilibrate their imbalance via scattering
processes. In the present work we use a tunable QH circuit to implement a
junction between co-propagating edge channels whose length can be controlled
with continuity. Such a variable device allows us to investigate how
current-voltage characteristics evolve when the junction length d is changed.
Recent experiments with fixed geometry reported a significant reduction of the
threshold voltage for the onset of photon emission, whose origin is still under
debate. Our spatially resolved measurements reveal that this threshold shift
depends on the junction length. We discuss this unexpected result on the basis
of a model which demonstrates that a heating of electrons is the dominant
process responsible for the observed reduction of the threshold voltage.

profound effect on the formation and evolution of galaxies, but how black holes

feedback studies have mainly focused on jet/cavity systems in the most massive

warm absorbers in some Broad Line Radio Galaxies allow us to investigate the
interplay between the nuclear engine and the surrounding medium from a
different perspective. We report on the detection of warm absorbers in two

each monomer of the backbone. Our investigation is focused on several key
questions that determine the bond scission mechanism and the ensuing

tension distributed along the BB-backbone at different grafting density
$\sigma_g$ of the side chains? How does tension $f$ depend on the length of the

examine the monomer density distribution profiles across the BB-backbone at

remaining chains spread better on the surface. Our simulation data are found to
be in qualitative agreement with experimental results and recent theoretical

channel, they exhibit a variety of collective behaviors. Under certain
conditions, the boats tend to cluster together and move in a relatively tight
formation. This type of behavior, referred to as clustering or swarming here,
is one of three types recently observed in experiment. Similar clustering
behavior is also reproduced in simulations based on a simple theoretical model.
Here we examine this model to determine the clustering mechanism and the
conditions under which clustering occurs. We also propose a method of
quantifying the behavior that may be used in future experimental work.

twofold reason: it captured in a physiological way the qualitative behavior of
Hodgkin-Huxley model and it revealed the power of simple dynamical models to
unfold complex firing patterns. To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in
qualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained
the core picture of neuronal excitability. Yet, a major difference between the
neurophysiology of 1961 and of 2011 is the recognition of the prominent role of
calcium channels in firing mechanisms. We show that including this extra
current in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics leads to a revision of Fitzugh-Nagumo phase
portrait that affects in a fundamental way the reduced modeling of neural
excitability. The revisited model considerably enlarges the modeling power of
the original one. In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological
signatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable
complexication of the classical model. As a basic illustration, the new model
is shown to highlight a core dynamical mechanism by which the calcium
conductance controls the two distinct firing modes of thalamocortical neurons.

Color magnitude diagrams (CMDs) constructed using the XMM-OM data along with
SDSS optical data show promise for evolutionary studies, with good separation
between red and blue sequences and real variation in the width of the red
sequence that is likely indicative of differences in star formation history.
This is particularly true for UVW1 data, as the relative abundance of data
collected using this filter and its depth make it an attractive choice.
Available tools that use stellar synthesis libraries to fit the UV and optical
photometric data may also be used, thereby better describing star formation
history within the past Gyr and providing estimates of total stellar mass that

  for UBVRI, Hipparcos and Tycho Photometry","44 pages, including 16 figures and a 12 page appendix",,"10.1086/664083",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have calculated improved photonic passbands for the UBV RI, Hipparcos and
Tycho Hp,BT,VT standard systems using the extensive spectrophotometric
libraries of NGSL and MILES. Using the Hp passband, we adjusted the absolute
flux levels of stars in the spectrophotometric libraries so their synthetic Hp
magnitudes matched the precise Hipparcos catalog value. Synthetic photometry
based on the renormalized fluxes were compared to the standard UBVRI and BT, VT
magnitudes and revised synthetic zero-points were determined. The Hipparcos and
Tycho photometry system zero-points were also compared to the V magnitude
zero-points of the SAAO UBVRI system, the homogenized UBV system and the
Walraven V B system. The confusion in the literature concerning broadband
magnitudes, fluxes, passbands and the choice of appropriate mean wavelengths is
detailed and discussed in an appendix.

reengineering their business processes by digitizing firms. If organizational
employees will not optimum utilize its IT infrastructure, the productivity gain
reduced enormously. In Uttarakhand e-procurement system implemented by public
sector under e-governance integrated mission mode projects. So, there is need
to find the determinants which influence employee's adoption and uses of
e-procurement systems. This research study assesses the organizational and
individual determinants that influence the use of e-procurement system in
Uttarakhand public sector. This study provides managers with the valuable
information to take intervention programs to achieve greater acceptance and
usage of e-procurement system. Data collected for this study by the means of a
survey conducted in Uttarakhand state in 2011. A total 1200 questionnaire forms
were distributed personally and online to employees using e-procurement system
in Uttarakhand.
