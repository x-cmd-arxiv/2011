themselves well to a functional data analysis approach and we have shown how
this naturally extends to the inclusion of covariates such as age and sex. Our
model presented here is a specialisation of the more general functional
mixed-effects model and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show
how to derive the maximum-likelihood estimators, EM-algorithm, confidence
intervals and smoother matrix with more than one fixed-effects function.
  We were motivated by a real data set characterising healthy human gene
expression levels over time and we have aimed to improve upon the existing
results with a more flexible model. By taking a roughness penalty approach,
this is achieved while avoiding overfitting, allowing for a departure from the
original linear mixed-effects model when the data permits it. A deeper
biological interpretation is required to fully assess our success here, but the
results we have highlighted in this paper suggest that we can easily attach

that quantum walks are versatile systems that simulate many topological phases

overall structure of the diffuse stellar populations in early type galaxies if
the number of clusters per unit stellar mass depends on metallicity. In this
paper we further test this assumption in the galaxy NGC 4486 (M 87), by
combining several data sources. The results show that globular clusters allow
the mapping of the galaxy in terms of the surface brightness profile,
integrated colour gradient, chemical abundance, and mass to luminosity ratios
up to 1000 arcsec (or 80.4 kpc) from its centre (i.e. some 10 effective radii).
The analysis indicates the presence of a dominant high metallicity bulge
associated with the red globulars, whose ellipticity increases outwards, and of
a more flattened low metallicity halo connected with the blue globulars. The
chemical abundance gradient of the composite stellar population is remarkably
similar to that inferred from X ray observations of hot gas. The
mass-metallicity spectrum of the stellar population can, in principle, be
understood in terms of inhomogeneous enrichment models. In turn, the
distribution of the bluest GCs, and lowest metallicity halo stars, has an
intriguing similarity with that of dark matter, a feature shared with NGC 1399.
Also, in these two galaxies, the number of blue GCs per dark mass unit is
identical within the errors, \approx 1.0(\pm0.3) \times 10^{-9} . The total

the set of Nash equilibria (NE) of decentralized networks comprising several
transmitters communicating with a single receiver that implements single user
decoding. This scenario is modeled as a one-shot game where the players (the
transmitters) have discrete action sets (the channels). We show that the
corresponding game has always at least one NE in pure strategies, but,
depending on certain parameters, the game might possess several NE. We provide
an upper bound for the maximum number of NE as a function of the number of
transmitters and available channels. The main contribution of this paper is a
mathematical proof of the existence of a Braess-type paradox. In particular, it
is shown that under the assumption of a fully loaded network, when transmitters
are allowed to use all the available channels, the corresponding sum spectral
efficiency achieved at the NE is lower or equal than the sum spectral
efficiency achieved when transmitters can use only one channel. A formal proof
of this observation is provided in the case of small networks. For general
scenarios, we provide numerical examples that show that the same effect holds
as long as the network is kept fully loaded. We conclude the paper by
considering the case of successive interference cancellation at the receiver.
In this context, we show that the power allocation vectors at the NE are
capacity maximizers. Finally, simulations are presented to verify our

by a random prescription for the influx or outflux of matter through the

Unidirectional switching is achieved by taking advantage of an asymmetry for CW

subject to substantial radius inflation. The inflation effect has been
discussed in relation to the radius problem of WR stars, but has yet failed to
explain the large observed radii of Galactic WR stars. We wish to obtain a
physical perspective of the inflation effect, and study the consequences for
the radii of WR stars, and LBVs. For WR stars the observed radii are up to an
order of magnitude larger than predicted by theory, whilst S Doradus-type LBVs
are subject to humongous radius variations, which remain as yet ill-explained.
We use a dual approach to investigate the envelope inflation, based on
numerical models for stars near the Eddington limit, and a new analytic
formalism to describe the effect. An additional new aspect is that we take the
effect of density inhomogeneities (clumping) within the outer stellar envelopes
into account. Due to the effect of clumping we are able to bring the observed
WR radii in agreement with theory. Based on our new formalism, we find that the
radial inflation is a function of a dimensionless parameter W, which largely
depends on the topology of the Fe-opacity peak, i.e., on material properties.
For W>1, we discover an instability limit, for which the stellar envelope
becomes gravitationally unbound, i.e. there no longer exists a static solution.
Within this framework we are also able to explain the S Doradus-type
instabilities for LBVs like AG Car, with a possible triggering due to changes
in stellar rotation. The stellar effective temperatures in the upper HR diagram
are potentially strongly affected by the inflation effect. This may have
particularly strong effects on the evolved massive LBV and WR stars just prior
to their final collapse, as the progenitors of SNe Ibc, SNe II, and long GRBs.

multipliers coupled to the pad electrode either directly or via a resistive
anode. Investigations employing standard discrete electronics and the KPiX
readout system have been carried out both under laboratory conditions and with
muons and pions at the CERN RD51 test beam. For detectors having a
charge-induction gap, it has been shown that even a ~6 mm thick single-THGEM
detector reached detection efficiencies above 95%, with pad-hit multiplicity of
1.1-1.2 per event; discharge probabilities were of the order of 1e-6 - 1e-5
sparks/trigger, depending on the detector structure and gain. Preliminary beam
tests with a WELL hole-structure, closed by a resistive anode, yielded
discharge probabilities of <2e-6 for an efficiency of ~95%. Methods are
presented to reduce charge-spread and pad multiplicity with resistive anodes.
The new method showed good prospects for further evaluation of very thin
THGEM-based detectors as potential active elements for DHCAL, with competitive
performances, simplicity and robustness. Further developments are in course.

active longitude belts and each active longitude belts might be switch.
Comparing the light curves of 2009 and 2010, it indicates that the light curve

emerged, in particular thanks to the advances in numerical simulations, from
the first ones that included tens of particles to the most sophisticated ones
with tens of millions of them and state-of-the-art hydrodynamical
prescriptions. Theoretical aspects pertaining to the formation of tidal tails
are then presented. The third part of the review turns to observations and
underlines the need for collecting deep multi-wavelength data to tackle the
variety of physical processes exhibited by collisional debris. Tidal tails are
not just stellar structures, but turn out to contain all the components usually
found in galactic disks, in particular atomic / molecular gas and dust. They
host star-forming complexes and are able to form star-clusters or even
second-generation dwarf galaxies. The final part of the review discusses what
tidal tails can tell us (or not) about the structure and content of present-day
galaxies, including their dark components, and explains how tidal tails may be
used to probe the past evolution of galaxies and their mass assembly history.
On-going deep wide-field surveys disclose many new low-surface brightness
structures in the nearby Universe, offering great opportunities for attempting
galactic archeology with tidal tails.

category is a triangulated category. As we show, the category \Cal L is the
category of perfect differential kQ-modules and the stable category of \Cal L
is triangle equivalent to the orbit category of the derived category D^b(mod
kQ) modulo the shift. The homology functor H from mod \Lambda{} to \mod kQ

association with a $W$ boson in proton-antiproton collisions
($p\bar{p}\rightarrow W^\pm H \rightarrow \ell\nu b\bar{b}$) at a center of
mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The search employs data collected with the CDF II
detector which correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 2.7
fb$^{-1}$. We recorded this data with two kinds of triggers. The first kind
required high-p$_T$ charged leptons and the second required both missing
transverse energy and jets. The search selects events consistent with a
signature of a single lepton ($e^\pm/\mu^\pm$), missing transverse energy, and
two jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary
vertex tagging method and a jet probability tagging method. Kinematic
information is fed in an artificial neural network to improve discrimination
between signal and background. The search finds that both the observed number
of events and the neural network output distributions are consistent with the
standard model background expectations, and sets 95% confidence level upper
limits on the production cross section times branching ratio. The limits are
expressed as a ratio to the standard model production rate. The limits range
from 3.6 (4.3 expected) to 61.1 (43.2 expected) for Higgs masses from 100 to
150 GeV/$c^{2}$, respectively.

maximally localized Wannier functions are constructed and used to interpolate
the necessary k-space quantities on a fine mesh, in parallel to a
previously-developed formalism for the anomalous Hall conductivity [X.Wang, J.

Since only a few (e.g., of the order of 20) Wannier functions are typically
needed to describe the occupied and partially occupied bands, these Wannier
matrices are small, which makes the interpolation itself very efficient. The
method has been used to calculate the orbital magnetization of bcc Fe, hcp Co,

currents inside atomic spheres, our results nicely reproduce the experimentally

and chemical properties directly influence the planet formation process. As
most planets supposedly form in the inner disk regions, i.e., within a few tens
of AU, it is crucial to study circumstellar disk on these scales to constrain
the conditions for planet formation. Our aims are to characterize the inner
regions of the circumstellar disk around the young Herbig Ae/Be star HD97048 in
polarized light. We use VLT/NACO to observe HD97048 in polarimetric
differential imaging (PDI) mode in the H and Ks band. We spatially resolve the
disk around HD97048 in polarized flux in both filters on scales between
~0.1""-1.0"" corresponding to the inner ~16-160 AU. Fitting isophots to the flux
calibrated H-band image between 13 - 14 mag/arcsec^2 and 14 - 15 mag/arcsec^2
we derive a apparent disk inclination angle of 34+-5 deg and 47+-2 deg,
respectively. The disk position angle in both brightness regimes is almost
identical and roughly 80 deg. Along the disk major axis the surface brightness
of the polarized flux drops from ~11 mag/arcsec^2 at ~0.1"" (~16 AU) to ~15.3
mag/arcsec^2 at ~1.0"" (~160 AU). The brightness profiles along the major axis
are fitted with power-laws falling off as ~r^(-1.78+-0.02) in H and
~r^(-2.34+-0.04) in Ks. As the surface brightness drops off more rapidly in Ks
compared to H the disks becomes relatively bluer at larger separations possibly
indicating changing dust grain properties as a function of radius. For the
first time the inner ~0.1""-1.0"" (~16-160 AU) of the surface layer of the
HD97048 circumstellar disk have been imaged in scattered light demonstrating
the power of ground-based imaging polarimetry. Our data fill an important gap

evolution of the giant planets, especially Neptune, during the era following
planet formation, when the giant planets may have undergone planet-planet
scattering and/or planetesimal-driven migration. Numerical simulations of this
process, while reproducing many properties of the belt, fail to generate the
high inclinations and eccentricities observed for some objects while
maintaining the observed dynamically ""cold"" population. We present the first of
a three-part parameter study of how different dynamical histories of Neptune
sculpt the planetesimal disk. Here we identify which dynamical histories allow
an in situ planetesimal disk to remain dynamically cold, becoming today's cold
Kuiper belt population. We find that if Neptune undergoes a period of elevated
eccentricity and/or inclination, it secularly excites the eccentricities and
inclinations of the planetesimal disk. We demonstrate that there are several
well-defined regimes for this secular excitation, depending on the relative
timescales of Neptune's migration, the damping of Neptune's orbital inclination
and/or eccentricity, and the secular evolution of the planetesimals. We model
this secular excitation analytically in each regime, allowing for a thorough
exploration of parameter space. Neptune's eccentricity and inclination can
remain high for a limited amount of time without disrupting the cold classical
belt. In the regime of slow damping and slow migration, if Neptune is located
(for example) at 20 AU, then its eccentricity must stay below 0.18 and its
inclination below 6{\deg}.

precision observables but is also excluded by direct searches at the 7 TeV LHC

boson can be made consistent with both the indirect constraints and the direct
null searches by adding only one new particle beyond the Standard Model. This
new particle should be a weak multiplet in order to have additional
contributions to the oblique parameters. If it is a color singlet, we find that
a heavy Higgs with an intermediate mass of 200 - 300 GeV can decay into the new
states, suppressing the branching ratios for the standard model modes, and thus
hiding a heavy Higgs at the LHC. If the new particle is also charged under QCD,
the Higgs production cross section from gluon fusion can be reduced
significantly due to the new colored particle one-loop contribution. Current
collider constraints on the new particles allow for viable parameter space to
exist in order to hide a heavy Higgs boson. We categorize the general
signatures of these new particles, identify favored regions of their parameter
space and point out that discovering or excluding them at the LHC can provide
important indirect information for a heavy Higgs. Finally, for a very heavy

In this model, the $B$ field satisfies quadratic simplicity constraints similar
to that of the four-dimensional Plebanski theory, but with the difference that
the $B$ field is now a one-form. We exhibit a natural notion of ""simple
one-form"", and identify a gravitational sector, a topological sector and a
degenerate sector in the space of solutions to the simplicity constraints.
Classically, in the gravitational sector, the action is shown to be equivalent
to that of three-dimensional first order Riemannian gravity. This enables us to
perform the complete spin foam quantization of the theory once the simplicity
constraints are solved at the classical level, and to compare this result with
the various models that have been proposed for the implementation of the
constraints after quantization. In particular, we impose the simplicity
constraints following the prescriptions of the so-called BC and EPRL models. We
observe that the BC prescription cannot lead to the proper vertex amplitude.
The EPRL prescription allows to recover the expected result when, in this
three-dimensional model, it is supplemented with additional secondary second

matrices. These inequalities show that the norm of a high-dimensional signal
mapped by a Toeplitz matrix to a low-dimensional space concentrates around its
mean with a tail probability bound that decays exponentially in the dimension
of the range space divided by a quantity which is a function of the signal. For
the class of sparse signals, the introduced quantity is bounded by the sparsity
level of the signal. However, we observe that this bound is highly pessimistic
for most sparse signals and we show that if a random distribution is imposed on
the non-zero entries of the signal, the typical value of the quantity is
bounded by a term that scales logarithmically in the ambient dimension. As an
application of the CoM inequalities, we consider Compressive Binary Detection
(CBD).

based on the analysis of the intensity of structures. This analysis is done in
a residual image that is the result of the subtraction of a surface brightness
model, obtained by fitting a two-dimensional analytical model (beta-model or
S\'ersic profile) with elliptical symmetry, from the X-ray image. Our method is
applied to 34 clusters observed by the Chandra Space Telescope that are in the
redshift range 0.02<z<0.2 and have a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. We
present the calibration of the method and the relations between the
substructure level with physical quantities, such as the mass, X-ray
luminosity, temperature, and cluster redshift. We use our method to separate
the clusters in two sub-samples of high and low substructure levels. We
conclude, using Monte Carlo simulations, that the method recuperates very well
the true amount of substructure for small angular core radii clusters (with
respect to the whole image size) and good signal-to-noise observations. We find
no evidence of correlation between the substructure level and physical
properties of the clusters such as mass, gas temperature, X-ray luminosity and
redshift. The scaling relations for the two sub-samples (high and low
substructure level clusters) are different (they present an off-set, i.e.,
given a fixed mass or temperature, low substructure clusters tend to be more
X-ray luminous), which is an important result for cosmological tests using the
mass-luminosity relation to obtain the cluster mass function, since they rely
on the assumption that clusters do not present different scaling relations
according to their dynamical state.

T-duality and U-duality. The fermionic T-duality transformation is applied to
the D-brane and pp-wave solutions of type IIB supergravity. New supersymmetric
solutions of complexified supergravity are generated. We show that the pp-wave
yields a purely imaginary background after two dualities, undergoes a geometric
transformation after four dualities, and is self-dual after eight dualities.
Next we apply six bosonic and six fermionic T-dualities to the AdS_4 x CP^3
background of type IIA supergravity, which is relevant to the current research
in the amplitude physics. This helps to elucidate the potential obstacles in
establishing the self-duality, and quite independently from that shows us that
fermionic T-dualities may be degenerate under some circumstances. Finally, we
make a step towards constructing a manifestly U-duality covariant action for
D=10 supergravities by deriving the generalized metric for a D1-brane. This is
a single structure that treats brane wrapping coordinates on the same footing
as spacetime coordinates. It turns out that the generalized metric of a
D-string results from that of the fundamental string if one replaces the
spacetime metric with the open string metric. We also find an antisymmetric
contribution to the generalized metric that can be interpreted as a
noncommutativity parameter.

as coded single-tone signaling (STS). The proposed coded STS scheme possesses
certain highly desirable properties, such as no dedicated resource requirement
(no overhead), no near-and-far effect, no inter-signal interference (no
multi-user interference), low peak-to-average power ratio (deep coverage). In
addition, the proposed coded STS can fully exploit frequency diversity and
provides a means for high quality wideband channel estimation. The coded STS
design is demonstrated through a concrete numerical example. Performance of the
proposed coded STS and its effect on cochannel traffic channels are evaluated
through simulations.

(under the Hamming metric) has been widely studied in recent years. Motivated
by the similar discrete structure of linear codes and point lattices in R^N,
and their many shared applications across complexity theory, cryptography, and
coding theory, we initiate the study of list decoding for lattices. Namely: for
a lattice L in R^N, given a target vector r in R^N and a distance parameter d,
output the set of all lattice points w in L that are within distance d of r.
  In this work we focus on combinatorial and algorithmic questions related to
list decoding for the well-studied family of Barnes-Wall lattices. Our main
contributions are twofold:
  1) We give tight (up to polynomials) combinatorial bounds on the worst-case
list size, showing it to be polynomial in the lattice dimension for any error
radius bounded away from the lattice's minimum distance (in the Euclidean
norm).
  2) Building on the unique decoding algorithm of Micciancio and Nicolosi (ISIT
'08), we give a list-decoding algorithm that runs in time polynomial in the
lattice dimension and worst-case list size, for any error radius. Moreover, our
algorithm is highly parallelizable, and with sufficiently many processors can
run in parallel time only poly-logarithmic in the lattice dimension.
  In particular, our results imply a polynomial-time list-decoding algorithm
for any error radius bounded away from the minimum distance, thus beating a
typical barrier for error-correcting codes posed by the Johnson radius.

These models demonstrated that enhanced abundances of such species can be
explained by gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry following the partial sublimation
of methane from grain surfaces. We also concluded that the abundances of
hydrocarbon radicals such as the C$_{\rm n}$H family should be further enhanced
as the temperatures increase to higher values, but this conclusion stood in
contrast with the lack of unambiguous detection of these species toward hot
core and corino sources. Meanwhile, observational surveys have identified
C$_2$H, C$_4$H, CH$_3$CCH, and CH$_3$OH toward hot corinos (especially IRAS
16293-2422) as well as towards L1527, with lower abundances for the carbon

bounds on two-party unbounded-rounds communication problems. We show that the
discrepancy lower bound, which applies to randomized communication complexity,
also applies to information complexity. More precisely, if the discrepancy of a
two-party function $f$ with respect to a distribution $\mu$ is $Disc_\mu f$,
then any two party randomized protocol computing $f$ must reveal at least
$\Omega(\log (1/Disc_\mu f))$ bits of information to the participants. As a
corollary, we obtain that any two-party protocol for computing a random
function on $\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}^n$ must reveal $\Omega(n)$ bits of
information to the participants.
  In addition, we prove that the discrepancy of the Greater-Than function is
$\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$, which provides an alternative proof to the recent proof
of Viola \cite{Viola11} of the $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound on the
communication complexity of this well-studied function and, combined with our
main result, proves the tight $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound on its information
complexity.

of an independent interest. In a very recent breakthrough work of Kerenidis et
al. \cite{kerenidis2012lower}, this simulation procedure was the main building
block for proving that almost all known lower bound techniques for
communication complexity (and not just discrepancy) apply to information
complexity.

shape of the LC between the occultations. Phase variations arise from (i)
reflected and thermally emitted light by the planet, (ii) the ellipsoidal shape
of the star due to the gravitational pull of the planet, and (iii) the Doppler
shift of the stellar light as the star orbits the center of mass of the system.
Our full model of the out-of-eclipse variations contains information about the
planetary mass, orbital eccentricity, the orientation of periastron and the
planet's albedo. For a range of hypothetical systems we demonstrate that the
ellipsoidal variations (ii.) can be large enough to be distinguished from the
remaining components and that this effect can be used to constrain the planet's
mass. To detect the ellipsoidal variations, the LC requires a minimum precision
of 10-4, which coincides with the precision of the Kepler mission. As a test of
our approach, we consider the Kepler LC of the transiting object HAT-P-7. We
are able to estimate the mass of the companion, and confirm its planetary
nature solely from the LC data. Future space missions, such as PLATO and the
James Webb Space Telescope with even higher photometric precision, will be able
to reduce the errors in all parameters. Detailed modeling of any out-of-eclipse
variations seen in new systems will be a useful diagnostic tool prior to the

astrophysical S-factors of radiative capture reactions with light atomic nuclei
on the basis of the potential two-cluster model by taking into account the
splitting the orbital states according to Young's schemes. Within this model,
interaction of the nucleon clusters is described by local two-particle
potential determined by fit to the scattering data and properties of bound
states of these clusters. Many-body character of the problem is taken into
account under some approximation, in terms of the allowed or forbidden by the
Pauli principle states in intercluster potentials. An important feature of the
approach is accounting for a dependence of interaction potential between
clusters on the orbital Young scheme, which determines the permutation symmetry
of the nucleon system. The astrophysical S-factors of the radiative capture
processes in the p2H, p7Li and p12C systems are analyzed on the basis of this
approach. It is shown that the approach allows one to describe quite reasonably
experimental data available at low energies, when the phase shifts of
cluster-cluster scattering are extracted from the data with minimal errors. In
this connection the problem of experimental error decrease is exclusively
urgent for the differential cross-sections of elastic scattering of light
atomic nuclei at astrophysical energies and to perform a more accurate phase
shift analysis. The increase in the accuracy will allow, in future, making more
definite conclusions regarding the mechanisms and conditions of thermonuclear
reactions, as well as understanding better their nature in general.

centrally in areas as diverse as differential equations, particle physics,
group theory, and the Mulmuley--Sohoni Geometric Complexity Theory program. A
matrix Lie algebra is a set L of matrices such that $A, B\in L$ implies $AB -
BA \in L$. Two matrix Lie algebras are conjugate if there is an invertible
matrix $M$ such that $L_1 = M L_2 M^{-1}$.
  We show that certain cases of Lie algebra conjugacy are equivalent to graph
isomorphism. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for other
cases of Lie algebra conjugacy, which allow us to essentially derandomize a
recent result of Kayal on affine equivalence of polynomials. Affine equivalence
is related to many complexity problems such as factoring integers, graph
isomorphism, matrix multiplication, and permanent versus determinant.
  Specifically, we show:
  Abelian Lie algebra conjugacy is equivalent to the code equivalence problem,
and hence is as hard as graph isomorphism.
  Abelian Lie algebra conjugacy of $n \times n$ matrices can be solved in
poly(n) time when the Lie algebras have dimension O(1).
  Semisimple Lie algebra conjugacy is equivalent to graph isomorphism. A Lie
algebra is semisimple if it is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras.
  Semisimple Lie algebra conjugacy of $n \times n$ matrices can be solved in
polynomial time when the Lie algebras consist of only $O(\log n)$ simple direct
summands.
  Conjugacy of completely reducible Lie algebras---that is, a direct sum of an
abelian and a semisimple Lie algebra---can be solved in polynomial time when
the abelian part has dimension O(1) and the semisimple part has $O(\log n)$
simple direct summands.

improper publishing and use of trajectory data could jeopardize individual
privacy. However, it has been shown that existing privacy-preserving trajectory
data publishing methods derived from partition-based privacy models, for

  In this paper, motivated by the data publishing scenario at the Societe de

study the problem of publishing trajectory data under the rigorous differential
privacy model. We propose an efficient data-dependent yet differentially
private sanitization algorithm, which is applicable to different types of

down the output domain by building a noisy prefix tree based on the underlying

constraints of a prefix tree to conduct constrained inferences, which lead to
better utility. This is the first paper to introduce a practical solution for
publishing large volume of trajectory data under differential privacy. We
examine the utility of sanitized data in terms of count queries and frequent
sequential pattern mining. Extensive experiments on real-life trajectory data
from the STM demonstrate that our approach maintains high utility and is
scalable to large trajectory datasets.

mostly lasting from a few seconds to a few thousand seconds. For such kind of
high energy transients, their isotropic-equivalent-energy ($E_{\rm iso}$)
function may be more scientifically meaningful when compared with GRB
isotropic-equivalent-luminosity function ($L_{\rm iso}$), as the traditional
luminosity function refers to steady emission much longer than a few thousand
seconds. In this work we for the first time construct the
isotropic-equivalent-energy function for a sample of 95 bursts with measured
redshifts ($z$) and find an excess of high-$z$ GRBs. Assuming that the excess
is caused by a GRB luminosity function evolution in a power-law form, we find a
cosmic evolution of $E_{\rm iso}\propto(1+z)^{1.80^{+0.36}_{-0.63}}$, which is
comparable to that between $L_{\rm iso}$ and $z$, i.e., $L_{\rm
iso}\propto(1+z)^{2.30^{+0.56}_{-0.51}}$ (both $1\sigma$). The
evolution-removed isotropic-equivalent-energy function can be reasonably fitted
by a broken power-law, in which the dim and bright segments are $\psi(E_{\rm

iso}^{-0.87\pm0.07}$, respectively ($1\sigma$). For the cosmic GRB formation

which the ground state properties and excitation spectrum are known exactly.
The model has an interesting phase diagram describing quantum phase transitions
(QPTs) belonging to two different universality classes. These are the
transverse-field Ising model and the XX model universality classes with both
the models being special cases of the transverse-field XY model. In recent
years, quantities related to quantum information theoretic measures like
entanglement, quantum discord (QD) and fidelity have been shown to provide
signatures of QPTs. Another interesting issue is that of decoherence to which a
quantum system is subjected due to its interaction, represented by a quantum
channel, with an environment. In this paper, we determine the dynamics of
different types of correlations present in a quantum system, namely, the mutual
information, the classical correlations and the quantum correlations, as
measured by the quantum discord, in a two-qubit state. The density matrix of
this state is given by the nearest-neighbour reduced density matrix obtained
from the ground state of the transverse-field XY model in 1d. We assume
Markovian dynamics for the time-evolution due to system-environment
interactions. The quantum channels considered include the bit-flip,
bit-phase-flip and phase-flip channels. Two different types of dynamics are
identified for the channels in one of which the quantum correlations are
greater in magnitude than the classical correlations in a finite time interval.
The origins of the different types of dynamics are further explained. For the
different channels, appropriate quantities associated with the dynamics of the
correlations are identified which provide signatures of QPTs. We also report
results for further-neighbour two-qubit states and finite temperatures.

used as a high pressure gauge in Diamond Anvil Cells (DACs). Nanoparticles have
important advantages in comparison with the currently used ruby fluorescence
gauge. Because of their small dimensions they can be spread uniformly over a
diamond surface without bridging between the two diamond anvils. Furthermore
their properties are measured by broad band optical transmission spectroscopy
leading to a very large signal-to-noise ratio even in the multi-megabar
pressure regime where ruby measurements become challenging. Finally their
resonant frequencies can be tuned to lie in a convenient part of the visible
spectrum accessible to CCD detectors. Theoretical calculations for a nanoshell
with a SiO2 core and a golden shell, using both the hybridization model and Mie
theory, are presented here. The calculations for the nanoshell in vacuum
predict that nanoshells can indeed have a measurable pressure-dependent optical
response desirable for gauges.However when the nanoshells are placed in
commonly used DAC pressure media, resonance peak positions as a function of
pressure are no longer single-valued and depend on the pressure media,
rendering them impractical as a pressure gauge. To overcome these problems an
alternative nanoparticle is studied: coating the nanoshell with an extra
dielectric layer (SiO2) provides an easy way to shield the pressure gauge from
the influence of the medium, leaving the compression of the particle due to the
pressure as the main effect on the spectrum. We have analyzed the response to
pressure up to 200 GPa. We conclude that a coated nanoshell could provide a new
gauge for high-pressure measurements that has advantages over current methods.

simulations to evaluate the solubility of noble gases in silicate melts of
various compositions. At low pressure the calculated solubility constants (the
inverse of the Henry's constant) are in excellent agreement with data of the
literature. In particular it is found that the solubility constant (i)
decreases when the size of the noble gas increases, (ii) decreases from
silica-rich to silica-poor composition of the melt, and (iii) is positively
correlated with the temperature. Moreover it is shown that the solubility is
governed primarily by the entropic cost of cavity formation for inserting the
noble gas into the melt and secondarily by its solvation energy. Interestingly,
the behaviour of these two contributions differ from each other as the entropic
cost of cavity formation increases strongly with the size of the solute atom to
insert whereas large atoms are better solvated than small ones.
  With all melt composition investigated here (silica, rhyolite, MORB and
olivine), the calculated solubility curves exhibit the same qualitative
behaviour with pressure; a steep rise culminating in a broad maximum followed
by a gradual decrease of the solubility at higher pressure. At variance with
LHDAC experiments (Chamorro et al. (1996, 1998) and Bouhifd et al. (2006,
2008)) where a Ar solubility drop is observed at about 50 kbar in silica and
molten olivine and in the pressure range ~100-160 kbar with other melt

Background (NIRB), which contains information about galaxies which may be too
faint to be observed individually. We calculate the angular power spectrum
(C_l) of the NIRB fluctuations caused by the distribution of these galaxies.
Assuming a complete subtraction of any post-reionization component, C_l will be
dominated by galaxies responsible for completing reionization (e.g., z~6). The
shape of C_l at high l is sensitive to the amount of non-linear bias of dark
matter halos hosting galaxies. As the non-linear bias depends on the mass of
these halos, we can use the shape of C_l to infer typical masses of dark matter
halos responsible for completing reionization. We extend our previous study by
using a higher-resolution N-body simulation, which can resolve halos down to
10^8 M_sun. We also include improved radiative transfer, which allows for the
suppression of star formation in small-mass halos due to photo-ionization
heating. As the non-linear bias enhances the dark-matter-halo power spectrum on
small scales, we find that C_l is steeper for the case with a complete
suppression of small sources or partial suppression of star formation in small
halos (the minimum galaxy mass is M_min=10^9 M_sun in ionized regions and
M_min=10^8 M_sun in neutral regions) than the case in which these small halos
were unsuppressed. In all cases, we do not see a turn-over toward high l in the
shape of l^2 C_l.

algebraic viewpoint, the algebras of partial difference polynomials are free
objects in the category of commutative algebras endowed with the action by
endomorphisms of a monoid isomorphic to $\N^r$. Then, the investigation of
Gr\""obner bases in this context contributes also to the current research trend
consisting in studying polynomial rings under the action of suitable symmetries
that are compatible with effective methods. Since the algebras of difference
polynomials are not Noetherian ones, we propose in this paper a theory for
grading them that provides a Noetherian subalgebras filtration. This implies
that the variants of the Buchberger's algorithm we developed for difference
ideals terminate in the finitely generated graded case when truncated up to
some degree. Moreover, even in the non-graded case, we provide criterions for
certifying completeness of eventually finite Gr\""obner bases when they are
computed within sufficiently large bounded degrees. We generalize also the

an implementation in Maple that is the first to provide computations for

with strong static and time-dependent forces are studied. We apply a
semi-empirical lattice model and use master equation and kinetic Monte Carlo
simulation methods to compute observables such as the velocity and the
diffusion coefficient. Two types of time-dependent driving are considered: a
pulsed rotated field and an alternating field with a zero net force
(electrophoretic ratchet). Small islands up to 12 atoms were studied in detail
with the master equation method and larger ones with simulations. Results are
presented mainly for a parametrization of Cu on Cu(001) surface, which has been
the main system of interest in several previous studies. The main results are
that the pulsed field can increase the current in both diagonal and axis
direction when compared to static field, and there exists a current inversion
in the electrophoretic ratchet. Both of these phenomena are a consequence of
the coupling of the internal dynamics of the island with its transport. In
addition to the previously discovered ""magic size"" effect for islands in
equilibrium, a strong odd-even effect was found for islands driven far out of
equilibrium. Master equation computations revealed non-monotonous behavior for
the leading relaxation constant and effective Arrhenius parameters. Using cycle
optimization methods, typical island transport mechanisms are identified for
small islands.

effective at inducing seizure than conventional brief pulse (0.5ms-2.0ms).
Contrary to the studies, we experienced a case of schizophrenia in which m-ECT

presence of cosmic strings. During this radiation-plus-strings stage the
Universe matter-energy content can be modelled by a two-component fluid,
consisting of radiation (dominant) and a cosmic-string fluid (subdominant). It
was found that, during this stage, the cosmological gravitational waves (CGWs)
- that had been produced in an earlier (inflationary) epoch - with comoving
wave-numbers below a critical value (which depends on the physics of the
cosmic-string network) were filtered, leading to a distorsion in the expected
(scale-invariant) CGW power spectrum. In any case, the cosmological evolution
gradually results in the scaling of any long-cosmic-string network and, hence,
after a short time-interval, the Universe enters into the late-radiation era.
However, along the transition from an early-radiation epoch to the
late-radiation era through the radiation-plus-strings stage, the
time-dependence of the cosmological scale factor is modified, something that
leads to a discontinuous change of the corresponding scalar curvature, which,
in turn, triggers the quantum-mechanical creation of gravitons. In this paper
we discuss several aspects of such a process, and, in particular, the
observational consequences on the expected gravitational-wave (GW) power
spectrum.

increasing role in quantum engineering. In the quantum set-up, system

channel by probing it repeatedly with different input states. However for
quantum dynamical systems like quantum Markov processes, it is more natural to
consider the estimation based on continuous measurements of the output, with a
given input which may be stationary. We address this problem using asymptotic
statistics tools, for the specific example of estimating the Rabi frequency of
an atom maser. We compute the Fisher information of different measurement
processes as well as the quantum Fisher information of the atom maser, and
establish the local asymptotic normality of these statistical models. The
statistical notions can be expressed in terms of spectral properties of certain
deformed Markov generators and the connection to large deviations is briefly
discussed.

number of exoplanets. However, when it comes to the composition of the observed

planetary parameter sensitive to the planet's density distribution could help
constrain this large number of possible models even further. We aim to
investigate to what extent an exoplanet's interior can be constrained in terms
of core mass and envelope metallicity by taking the tidal Love number k_2 into
account as an additional possibly observable parameter. Because it is the only
planet with an observationally determined k_2, we constructed interior models
for the Hot Jupiter exoplanet HAT-P-13b by solving the equations of hydrostatic
equilibrium and mass conservation for different boundary conditions. In
particular, we varied the surface temperature and the outer temperature
profile, as well as the envelope metallicity within the widest possible
parameter range. We also considered atmospheric conditions that are consistent
with nongray atmosphere models. For all these models we calculated the Love
number k_2 and compared it to the allowed range of k_2 values that could be
obtained from eccentricity measurements of HAT-P-13b. We use the example of
HAT-P-13b to show the general relationships between the quantities temperature,
envelope metallicity, core mass, and Love number of a planet. For any given k_2
value a maximum possible core mass can be determined. For HAT-P-13b we find
Mcore < 27 ME, based on the latest eccentricity measurement. We are able to
constrain both the envelope and bulk metallicity of HAT-P-13b to 1 -- 11 times

types of transport processes. The extreme events, defined as exceedences of the
flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold, have been studied recently in the
context of complex networks. This was motivated by the occurrence of rare
events such as traffic jams, floods, and power black-outs which take place on
networks. In this work, we study extreme events in a generalized random walk
model in which the walk is preferentially biased by the network topology. The
walkers preferentially choose to hop toward the hubs or small degree nodes. In
this setting, we show that extremely large fluctuations in event-sizes are
possible on small degree nodes when the walkers are biased toward the hubs. In
particular, we obtain the distribution of event-sizes on the network. Further,
the probability for the occurrence of extreme events on any node in the network
depends on its 'generalized strength', a measure of the ability of a node to
attract walkers. The 'generalized strength' is a function of the degree of the
node and that of its nearest neighbors. We obtain analytical and simulation
results for the probability of occurrence of extreme events on the nodes of a
network using a generalized random walk model. The result reveals that the
nodes with a larger value of 'generalized strength', on average, display lower
probability for the occurrence of extreme events compared to the nodes with
lower values of 'generalized strength'.

illustrate how the formalism has been applied in the air shower radio emission
code REAS3 to unify the microscopic and macroscopic views of radio emission
from extensive air showers. Indeed, the formalism is completely universal and
particularly well-suited for implementation in Monte Carlo codes in the time-
and frequency-domains. It easily reproduces well-known ""classical mechanisms""
such as synchrotron radiation, Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and transition
radiation in the adequate limits, but has the advantage that it continues to
work in realistic, complex situations, where the ""classical mechanisms"" tend to
no longer apply and adhering to them can result in misleading interpretations.
