the occupation time, which is the equivalent quantity for the mass per unit

the modulational instability in anomalous dispersive media. In the case of a

antineutrino at a rate proportional to a^3G_F^2E^{2+3k}. Unlike the
Cohen-Glashow instability, the splitting instability exists even if all
particles involved in the interaction have the same dispersion relations at the
relevant energy scales. We show that this instability leads to strong
constraints even if the energy E is a function of both the momentum P and also
of the background density rho, for example we show that it alone would have
been sufficient to eliminate any model of the MINOS/OPERA velocity anomaly

communication, unmodeled dynamics and system abstraction, which can not be
adequately captured by the traditional sequencing-based language equivalence.
As a finer behavior equivalence than language equivalence, bisimulation not
only allows the full set of branching behaviors but also explicitly specifies
the properties in terms of temporal logic such as CTL* and mu-calculus. This
observation motivates us to consider the decentralized control of discrete
event systems (DESs) for bisimulation equivalence in this paper, where the
plant and the specification are taken to be nondeterministic and the supervisor
is taken to be deterministic. An automata-based control framework is
formalized, upon which we develop three architectures with respect to different
decision fusion rules for the decentralized bisimilarity control, named a
conjunctive architecture, a disjunctive architecture and a general
architecture. Under theses three architectures, necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of decentralized bisimilarity supervisors are
derived respectively, which extend the traditional results of supervisory
control from language equivalence to bisimulation equivalence. It is shown that
these conditions can be verified with exponential complexity. Furthermore, the
synthesis of bisimilarity supervisors is presented when the existence condition
holds.

the unpolarized cross section. Finally, we compute the transverse target single
spin asymmetry as a function of skewness. We find it to be sizable in the
valence region and sensitive to the phenomenological input of our \pi N TDA

to completely describe a quantum system. Despite its fundamental role, it is
typically introduced as an abstract element of the theory with no explicit
definition. Rather, physicists come to a working understanding of the
wavefunction through its use to calculate measurement outcome probabilities via
the Born Rule. Presently, scientists determine the wavefunction through
tomographic methods, which estimate the wavefunction that is most consistent
with a diverse collection of measurements. The indirectness of these methods
compounds the problem of defining the wavefunction. Here we show that the
wavefunction can be measured directly by the sequential measurement of two
complementary variables of the system. The crux of our method is that the first
measurement is performed in a gentle way (i.e. weak measurement) so as not to
invalidate the second. The result is that the real and imaginary components of
the wavefunction appear directly on our measurement apparatus. We give an
experimental example by directly measuring the transverse spatial wavefunction
of a single photon, a task not previously realized by any method. We show that
the concept is universal, being applicable both to other degrees of freedom of
the photon (e.g. polarization, frequency, etc.) and to other quantum systems
(e.g. electron spin-z quantum state, SQUIDs, trapped ions, etc.). Consequently,
this method gives the wavefunction a straightforward and general definition in
terms of a specific set of experimental operations. We expect it to expand the
range of quantum systems scientists are able to characterize and initiate new
avenues to understand fundamental quantum theory.

111 AU from the Sun. This conclusion is based on the fact that the low energy
6-14 MeV galactic electron intensity suddenly increased by ~20% over a time
period \leg 10 days and the electron radial intensity gradient abruptly
decreased from ~19%/AU to ~8%/AU at 2009.7 at a radial distance of 111.2 AU. A
sudden radial gradient change was also observed at this time for >200 MeV
protons. The gradients were constant during the time period before and after
the electron increase. At about 2011.2 at a distance of 116.6 AU a second
abrupt intensity increase was observed, this time for both electrons and
protons. The increase for electrons was ~25% and occurred over a time period
~15 days or less. For >200 MeV protons the increase at this time was ~5%
(unusually large) and occurred over a longer time period ~50 days. Between
about 2011.2 and 2011.6, radial intensity gradients ~18%/AU and 3%/AU were
observed for electrons and protons, respectively. These gradients were very
similar to those observed for these particles before the 1st sudden increase at
2009.7. These large positive gradients observed after 2011.2 indicate that V1,
although it has entered a different propagation region, is still within the
overall heliospheric modulating region at least up to a time ~2011.6 (118.0
AU). In this paper we will discuss these events in more detail and consider

by a cuspy mass distribution in the inner disk region and by an exponential
distribution in the outer region of the disk. The FMD is quite different from
the better known exponential disk or the untruncated Mestel disk which, being
infinite in extent, are not realistic models of real spiral galaxies. In
particular, the FMD requires significantly less mass to explain a measured

Agile-BOLTZTRAN to examine the effects of several approximations used in
multidimensional core-collapse supernova simulations. Our code permits us to
examine the effects of these approximations quantitatively by removing, or
substituting for, the pieces of supernova physics of interest. These
approximations include: (1) using Newtonian versus general relativistic
gravity, hydrodynamics, and transport; (2) using a reduced set of weak
interactions, including the omission of non-isoenergetic neutrino scattering,
versus the current state-of-the-art; and (3) omitting the velocity-dependent
terms, or observer corrections, from the neutrino Boltzmann kinetic equation.
We demonstrate that each of these changes has noticeable effects on the
outcomes of our simulations. Of these, we find that the omission of observer
corrections is particularly detrimental to the potential for neutrino-driven
explosions and exhibits a failure to conserve lepton number. Finally, we
discuss the impact of these results on our understanding of current, and the

reports such a rapid change of magnetic fields during the 2011 February 13 M6.6

Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager with 12-min cadence. High-resolution
magnetograms of Hinode that are available at ~-5.5, -1.5, 1.5, and 4 hrs
relative to the flare maximum are used to reconstruct three-dimensional coronal
magnetic field under the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) assumption. UV and
hard X-ray images are also used to illuminate the magnetic field evolution and
energy release. The rapid change is mainly detected by HMI in a compact region
lying in the center of the magnetic sigmoid, where the mean horizontal field
strength exhibited a significant increase by 28%. The region lies between the
initial strong UV and hard X-ray sources in the chromosphere, which are
cospatial with the central feet of the sigmoid according to the NLFFF model.
The NLFFF model further shows that strong coronal currents are concentrated
immediately above the region, and that more intriguingly, the coronal current
system underwent an apparent downward collapse after the sigmoid eruption.
These results are discussed in favor of both the tether-cutting reconnection
producing the flare and the ensuing implosion of the coronal field resulting
from the energy release.

semiclassically for an arbitrary hopping rate. Compact analytic results for the
magnetoresistance are achievable when carrier hopping occurs much more
frequently than the hyperfine field precession period. In other regimes, the
magnetoresistance can be straightforwardly evaluated numerically. Slow and fast
hopping magnetoresistance are found to be uniquely characterized by their
lineshapes. We find that the threshold hopping distance is analogous a
phenomenological two-site model's branching parameter, and that the distinction
between slow and fast hopping is contingent on the threshold hopping distance.

combining discontinuous molecular dynamics and parallel tempering. The model
protein is a repeating sequence of four different beads, with interactions
mimicking those in real proteins. Neighbor distances and angles are restricted
to physical ranges and one out of the four kinds of beads can form hydrogen
bonds with each other, except if they are too close in the chain. In contrast
to earlier studies of this model, an explicit square-well solvent is included.
Beads that can form intra-chain hydrogen bonds, can also form (weaker) hydrogen
bonds with solvent molecules, while other beads are insoluble. By categorizing
the protein configurations according to their intra-chain bonds, one can
distinguish unfolded, helical, and collapsed helical structures. Simulations
for chains of 15, 20 and 25 beads show that at low temperatures, the most
likely structures are helical or collapsed helical, despite the low entropy of
these structures. The temperature at which helical structures become dominant
is higher than in the absence of a solvent. The cooperative effect of the
solvent is attributed to the presence of hydrophobic beads. A phase transition
of the solvent prevented the simulations of the 20-bead and 25-bead chains of
reaching low enough temperatures to confirm whether the free energy landscape
is funnel-shaped, although the results do not contradict that possibility.

reliably generated by a conserved mechanism: a L/R asymmetric signal is
transmitted from the embryonic node to other parts of the embryo by the L/R
asymmetric expression and diffusion of the TGF-$\beta$ related proteins Nodal
and Lefty via propagating gene expression fronts in the lateral plate mesoderm
(LPM) and midline. In zebrafish embryos, Nodal and Lefty expression can only
occur along 3 narrow stripes that express the co-receptor \emph{one-eyed
pinhead} (oep): Nodal along stripes in the left and right LPM, and Lefty along
the midline. In wild-type embryos, Nodal is only expressed in the left LPM but
not the right, because of inhibition by Lefty from the midline; however,
bilateral Nodal expression occurs in loss-of-handedness mutants. A
two-dimensional model of the zebrafish embryo predicts this loss of L/R
asymmetry in oep mutants \cite{henley-xu-burdine}. In this paper, we simplify
this two-dimensional picture to a one-dimensional model of Nodal and Lefty
front propagation along the oep-expressing stripes. We represent Nodal and
Lefty production by step functions that turn on when a linear function of Nodal
and Lefty densities crosses a threshold. We do a parameter exploration of front
propagation behavior, and find the existence of \emph{pinned} intervals, along
which the linear function underlying production is pinned to the threshold.
Finally, we find parameter regimes for which spatially uniform oscillating
solutions are possible.

that these correlations are primarily governed by the optical depth in the 12CO

optically thin molecular gas while those with settled dust and gas discs host
optically thick molecular gas. The ranges of the integrated line intensity

results in the necessity of altering the measure in the associated quantum
mechanical path integral. If the path integral is derived from the canonical
structure of the theory, then the choice of gauge conditions used in
constructing Faddeev's measure cannot be covariant. This shortcoming is
normally overcome either by using the ""Faddeev-Popov"" quantization procedure,
or by the approach of Batalin-Fradkin-Fradkina-Vilkovisky, and then
demonstrating that these approaches are equivalent to the path integral
constructed from the canonical approach with Faddeev's measure. We propose in
this paper an alternate way of defining the measure for the path integral when
it is constructed using the canonical procedure for theories containing first
class constraints and that this new approach can be used in conjunction with
covariant gauges. This procedure follows the Faddeev-Popov approach, but rather
than working with the form of the gauge transformation in configuration space,
it employs the generator of the gauge transformation in phase space. We
demonstrate this approach to the path integral by applying it to Yang-Mills
theory, a spin-two field and the first order Einstein-Hilbert action in two
dimensions. The problems associated with defining the measure for theories
containing second-class constraints and ones in which there are fewer secondary
first class constraints than primary first class constraints are discussed.

the models being valid up the GUT or Planck scale. We perform a detailed study
of the full CMSSM parameter space keeping the Higgs boson mass fixed to $125\pm

for the muon $(g-2)_\mu,$ we show that the CMSSM parameter space is divided

mass spectra. Imposing the $(g-2)_\mu$ constraint introduces severe tension
between the high SUSY scale and the experimental measurements -- only the
slepton co-annihilation region survives with potentially testable sparticle
masses at the LHC. In the latter case the spin-independent DM-nucleon

apparent anti-correlation with relativistic jets in low/hard states. These disk
winds are observed to be highly ionized, dense, and to have typical velocities
of $\sim$1000 km/s or less projected along our line of sight. Here, we present
an analysis of two {\it Chandra} High Energy Transmission Grating spectra of
the Galactic black hole candidate IGR J17091$-$3624 and contemporaneous EVLA
radio observations, obtained in 2011. The second {\it Chandra} observation
reveals an absorption line at 6.91$\pm$0.01 keV; associating this line with
He-like Fe XXV requires a blue-shift of $9300^{+500}_{-400}$ km/s (0.03$c$, or
the escape velocity at 1000 R$_{Schw}$). This projected outflow velocity is an
order of magnitude higher than has previously been observed in stellar-mass
black holes, and is broadly consistent with some of the fastest winds detected
in active galactic nuclei. A potential feature at 7.32 keV, if due to Fe XXVI,
would imply a velocity of $\sim 14600$ km/s (0.05$c$), but this putative
feature is marginal. Photoionization modeling suggests that the accretion disk
wind in IGR J17091$-$3624 may originate within 43,300 Schwarzschild radii of
the black hole, and may be expelling more gas than accretes. The
contemporaneous EVLA observations strongly indicate that jet activity was
indeed quenched at the time of our {\it Chandra} observations. We discuss the
results in the context of disk winds, jets, and basic accretion disk physics in
accreting black hole systems.

follow-up resources need to be used more efficiently in order to maximize
science output from limited telescope time. As such, it is becoming
increasingly important to rapidly identify bursts of interest as soon as
possible after the event, before the afterglows fade beyond detectability.
Studying the most distant (highest redshift) events, for instance, remains a
primary goal for many in the field. Here we present our Random forest Automated
Triage Estimator for GRB redshifts (RATE GRB-z) for rapid identification of
high-redshift candidates using early-time metrics from the three telescopes
onboard Swift. While the basic RATE methodology is generalizable to a number of
resource allocation problems, here we demonstrate its utility for
telescope-constrained follow-up efforts with the primary goal to identify and
study high-z GRBs. For each new GRB, RATE GRB-z provides a recommendation -
based on the available telescope time - of whether the event warrants
additional follow-up resources. We train RATE GRB-z using a set consisting of
135 Swift bursts with known redshifts, only 18 of which are z > 4.
Cross-validated performance metrics on this training data suggest that ~56% of
high-z bursts can be captured from following up the top 20% of the ranked
candidates, and ~84% of high-z bursts are identified after following up the top
~40% of candidates. We further use the method to rank 200+ Swift bursts with
unknown redshifts according to their likelihood of being high-z.

in place at z ~ 1. We separate the effects of environment and stellar mass on
galaxies by comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at
fixed environment, and fixed stellar mass. The SSFR of star-forming galaxies at
fixed environment is correlated with stellar mass; however, at fixed stellar
mass it is independent of environment. The same trend exists for the D(4000)
measures of both the star-forming and quiescent galaxies and shows that their
properties are determined primarily by their stellar mass, not by their
environment. Instead, it appears that environment's primary role is to control
the fraction of star-forming galaxies. Using the spectra we identify candidate
poststarburst galaxies and find that those with 9.3 < LogM* < 10.7 are 3.1 +/-
1.1 times more common in high-density regions compared to low-density regions.
The clear association of poststarbursts with high-density regions as well as
the lack of a correlation between the SSFRs and D(4000)s of star-forming
galaxies with their environment suggests that at z ~ 1 the
environmental-quenching timescale must be rapid. Lastly, we construct a simple
quenching model which demonstrates that the lack of a correlation between the
D(4000) of quiescent galaxies and their environment results naturally if self
quenching dominates over environmental quenching at z > 1, or if the evolution
of the self-quenching rate mirrors the evolution of the environmental-quenching

bias as the systems relax. We find that during a merger, a shock propagates
outward from the parent cluster, resulting in an overestimate in the
hydrostatic mass bias. After the merger, as a cluster relaxes, the bias in
hydrostatic mass estimate decreases but remains at a level of -5-10% with
15-20% scatter within r500. We also investigate the post-merger evolution of
the pressure support from bulk motions, a dominant cause of this residual mass
bias. At r500, the contribution from random motions peaks at 30% of the total
pressure during the merger and quickly decays to \sim 10-15% as a cluster
relaxes. Additionally, we use a measure of the random motion pressure to
correct the hydrostatic mass estimate. We discover that 4 Gyr after mergers,
the direct effects of the merger event on the hydrostatic mass bias have become
negligible. Thereafter, the mass bias is primarily due to residual bulk motions
in the gas which are not accounted for in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation.
We present a hydrostatic mass bias correction method that can recover the

non-conservation of horizontal momentum in the dynamics of a stably stratified
incompressible Euler fluid filling an infinite horizontal channel between rigid
upper and lower plates. Lack of conservation occurs even though in this
configuration only vertical external forces act on the system. This apparent
paradox was seemingly first noticed by Benjamin (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 165,
1986, pp. 445-474) in his classification of the invariants by symmetry groups
with the Hamiltonian structure of the Euler equations in two dimensional
settings, but it appears to have been largely ignored since. By working
directly with the motion equations, the paradox is shown here to be a
consequence of the rigid lid constraint coupling through incompressibility with
the infinite inertia of the far ends of the channel, assumed to be at rest in
hydrostatic equilibrium. Accordingly, when inertia is removed by eliminating
the stratification, or, remarkably, by using the Boussinesq approximation of
uniform density for the inertia terms, horizontal momentum conservation is
recovered. This interplay between constraints,action at a distance by
incompressibility, and inertia is illustrated by layer-averaged exact results,
two-layer long-wave models, and direct numerical simulations of the
incompressible Euler equations with smooth stratification.

violate Bell inequalities, revealing the profoundly counter-intuitive nature of
the physical universe. These correlations reflect the impossibility of
constructing a joint probability distribution for all values of all the
different properties observed in Bell inequality tests. Physically, the
impossibility of measuring such a distribution experimentally, as a set of
relative frequencies, is due to the quantum back-action of projective
measurements. Weakly coupling to a quantum probe, however, produces minimal
back-action, and so enables a weak measurement of the projector of one
observable, followed by a projective measurement of a non-commuting observable.
By this technique it is possible to empirically measure weak-valued
probabilities for all of the values of the observables relevant to a Bell test.
The marginals of this joint distribution, which we experimentally determine,
reproduces all of the observable quantum statistics including a violation of
the Bell inequality, which we independently measure. This is possible because
our distribution, like the weak values for projectors on which it is built, is
not constrained to the interval [0, 1]. It was first pointed out by Feynman
that, for explaining singlet-state correlations within ""a [local] hidden
variable view of nature ... everything works fine if we permit negative
probabilities"". However, there are infinitely many such theories. Our method,

certainly provide a valuable tool for studying the dynamic response of the

for understanding these coronal condensations. For a comparison to observations
we synthesize EUV emission from a time-dependent, one-dimensional model for
coronal loops, where we employ two heating scenarios: simply shutting down the
heating and a model where the heating is very concentrated at the loop
footpoints, while keeping the total heat input constant. The heating off/on
model does not lead to significant EUV count rates that one observes with
SDO/AIA. In contrast, the concentration of the heating near the footpoints
leads to thermal non-equilibrium near the loop top resulting in the well-known
catastrophic cooling. This process gives a good match to observations of
coronal condensations. This shows that the corona needs a steady supply of
energy to support the coronal plasma, even during coronal condensations.
Otherwise the corona would drain very fast, too fast to even form a

communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to
whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The
interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural
language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that
signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles,
status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding
such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge.
  Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between
participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes
the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this
observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination
that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works
consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more ""static"" form
of power based on status differences, and a more ""situational"" form of power in
which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this
framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships
in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments
before the U.S. Supreme Court.

cosmological constant. When cold dark matter is present, the supersymmetron
evolves to a matter dependent minimum where its energy density does not vanish
and could lead to the present acceleration of the Universe. The supersymmetron
generates a short ranged fifth force which evades gravitational tests. It could
lead to observable signatures on structure formation due to a very strong
coupling to dark matter. We investigate the cosmological evolution of the
field, focusing on the linear perturbations and the spherical collapse and find
that observable modifications in structure formation can indeed exist.
Unfortunately, we find that when the growth-rate of perturbations is in
agreement with observations, an additional cosmological constant is required to
account for dark energy. In this case, effects on large scale structures are
still present at the non-linear level which are investigated using the

players are (partially) altruistic. We model altruistic behavior by assuming
that player i's perceived cost is a convex combination of 1-\alpha_i times his
direct cost and \alpha_i times the social cost. Tuning the parameters \alpha_i
allows smooth interpolation between purely selfish and purely altruistic
behavior. Within this framework, we study altruistic extensions of linear
congestion games, fair cost-sharing games and valid utility games.
  We derive (tight) bounds on the price of anarchy of these games for several
solution concepts. Thereto, we suitably adapt the smoothness notion introduced
by Roughgarden and show that it captures the essential properties to determine
the robust price of anarchy of these games. Our bounds show that for congestion
games and cost-sharing games, the worst-case robust price of anarchy increases
with increasing altruism, while for valid utility games, it remains constant
and is not affected by altruism. However, the increase in the price of anarchy
is not a universal phenomenon: for symmetric singleton linear congestion games,
we derive a bound on the pure price of anarchy that decreases as the level of
altruism increases. Since the bound is also strictly lower than the robust
price of anarchy, it exhibits a natural example in which Nash equilibria are
more efficient than more permissive notions of equilibrium.

  remain unchanged",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At low temperatures observations of the Hall resistance for Quantum Hall
systems at the interface between two Hall plateaux reveal a power-law
behaviour, dR_xy/dB ~ T^(-p) (with p = 0.42 +/- 0.01); changing at still
smaller temperatures, T < T_s, to a temperature-independent value. Experiments
also show that the transition temperature varies with sample size, L, according
to T_s ~ 1/L. These experiments pose a potential challenge to the holographic
AdS/QHE model recently proposed in arXiv:1008.1917. This proposal, which was
motivated by the natural way AdS/CFT methods capture the emergent duality
symmetries exhibited by quantum Hall systems, successfully describes the
scaling exponent p by relating it to an infrared dynamical exponent z with p =
2/z. For a broad class of models z is robustly shown to be z = 5 in the regime
relevant to the experiments (though becoming z = 1 further in the ultraviolet).
By incorporating finite-size effects into these models we show that they
reproduce a transition to a temperature-independent regime, predicting a
transition temperature satisfying T_s ~ 1/L or ~ 1/L^5 in two separate regions
of parameter space, even though z = 5 governs the temperature dependence of the
conductivity in both cases. The possibility of a deviation from naive z = 5
scaling arises because the brane tension introduces a new scale, which alters
where the transition between UV and IR scaling occurs, in an L-dependent way.
The AdS/CFT calculation indicates the two regimes of temperature scaling are
separated by a first-order transition, suggesting new possibilities for testing
the picture experimentally. Remarkably, in this interpretation the gravity dual
of the transition from temperature scaling to temperature-independent
resistance is related to the Chandrashekar transition from a star to a black
hole with increasing mass.

possible AGNs identified from the BPT diagram, gas-phase metallicities are
obtained from [NII]/Halpha line ratio. The sample is split into three stellar
mass bins, and the spectra are stacked in each stellar mass bin. The
mass-metallicity relation obtained at z~1.4 is located between those at z~0.8
and z~2.2. We constrain an intrinsic scatter to be ~0.1 dex or larger in the
mass-metallicity relation at z~1.4; the scatter may be larger at higher
redshifts. We found trends that the deviation from the mass-metallicity
relation depends on the SFR and the half light radius: Galaxies with higher SFR
and larger half light radii show lower metallicities at a given stellar mass.
One possible scenario for the trends is the infall of pristine gas accreted
from IGM or through merger events. Our data points show larger scatter than the
fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) at z~0.1 and the average metallicities
slightly deviate from the FMR. The compilation of the mass-metallicity

protoplanetary disk in detail by using high-resolution three-dimensional
nested-grid hydrodynamic simulations, in order to provide a basis of formation
processes of satellites around giant planets. Based on detailed analyses of gas
accretion flow, we find that most of gas accretion onto circumplanetary disks
occurs nearly vertically toward the disk surface from high altitude, which
generates a shock surface at several scale heights of the circumplanetary disk.
The gas that has passed through the shock surface moves inward because its
specific angular momentum is smaller than that of the local Keplerian rotation,
while gas near the midplane in the protoplanetary disk cannot accrete to the
circumplanetary disk. Gas near the midplane within the planet's Hill sphere
spirals outward and escapes from the Hill sphere through the two Lagrangian
points L$_1$ and L$_2$. We also analyze fluxes of accreting mass and angular
momentum in detail and find that the distributions of the fluxes onto the disk
surface are well described by power-law functions and that a large fraction of
gas accretion occurs at the outer region of the disk, i.e., at about 0.1 times
the Hill radius. The nature of power-law functions indicates that, other than
the outer edge, there is no specific radius where gas accretion is
concentrated. These source functions of mass and angular momentum in the
circumplanetary disk would provide us with useful constraints on the structure
and evolution of the circumplanetary disk, which is important for satellite
formation.

globular cluster (GC) omega Cen is not the only GC that shows abundance spread
in heavy elements (e.g., Fe). In order to understand the origin of the Galactic
GCs with heavy element abundance spread (""HEAS""), we investigate the formation
processes of massive GCs (MGCs) with masses larger than 10^6 M_sun in gas-rich
dwarf galaxies interacting and merging with the very young Galaxy. We find that
massive and compact stellar clumps with masses larger than 10^6 M_sun, which
can be regarded as progenitors of MGCs, can form from massive gas clumps that
are developed through merging of gaseous regions initially at different regions
and thus with different metallicities. Therefore it is inevitable that MGCs
formed in dwarfs have HEAS. The abundance spread in each individual MGC depends
on the radial metallicity gradient of the host dwarf such that it can be larger
for the steeper metallicity gradient. For example, MGCs formed in a dwarf with
a central metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.1 and the radial gradient of -0.2 dex
kpc^{-1} can have the abundance spread of Delta [Fe/H] ~.2. The simulated MGCs
appear to be significantly flattened owing to their dissipative formation from
gas disks of their host dwarfs. Based on these results, we discuss possibly
diverse formation mechanisms for the Galactic GCs such as M22, M54, NGC 2419,
omega Cen, and Terzan 5.

regions provide an independent method for estimating the primordial helium
abundance. H II regions are described by several physical parameters such as
electron density, electron temperature, and reddening, in addition to y, the
ratio of helium to hydrogen. It had been customary to estimate or determine
self-consistently these parameters to calculate y. Frequentist analyses of the
parameter space have been shown to be successful in these determinations, and
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have proven to be very efficient in
sampling this parameter space. Nevertheless, accurate determination of the
primordial helium abundance from observations of H II regions is constrained by
both systematic and statistical uncertainties. In an attempt to better reduce
the latter, and better characterize the former, we apply MCMC methods to the
large dataset recently compiled by Izotov, Thuan, & Stasinska (2007). To
improve the reliability of the determination, a high quality dataset is needed.
In pursuit of this, a variety of cuts are explored. The efficacy of the He I
4026 emission line as a constraint on the solutions is first examined,
revealing the introduction of systematic bias through its absence. As a clear
measure of the quality of the physical solution, a \chi^2 analysis proves
instrumental in the selection of data compatible with the theoretical model. In
addition, the method also allows us to exclude systems for which parameter
estimations are statistical outliers. As a result, the final selected dataset
gains in reliability and exhibits improved consistency. Regression to zero
metallicity yields Y_p = 0.2534 \pm 0.0083, in broad agreement with the WMAP
result. The inclusion of more observations shows promise for further reducing
the uncertainty, but more high quality spectra are required.

  Reduction","Preprint submitted to Machine Learning Journal",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show how to incorporate information from labeled examples into nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for
dimensionality reduction. In addition to mapping the data into a space of lower
dimensionality, our approach aims to preserve the nonnegative components of the
data that are important for classification. We identify these components from
the support vectors of large-margin classifiers and derive iterative updates to
preserve them in a semi-supervised version of NMF. These updates have a simple
multiplicative form like their unsupervised counterparts; they are also
guaranteed at each iteration to decrease their loss function---a weighted sum
of I-divergences that captures the trade-off between unsupervised and
supervised learning. We evaluate these updates for dimensionality reduction
when they are used as a precursor to linear classification. In this role, we
find that they yield much better performance than their unsupervised
counterparts. We also find one unexpected benefit of the low dimensional
representations discovered by our approach: often they yield more accurate
classifiers than both ordinary and transductive SVMs trained in the original
input space.

presence of external harmonic trap makes it more interesting as in the atomic

theoretical and experimental results show that at zero temperature the
low-lying levels are of collective nature and high-lying excitations are of
single particle nature. We observe that for few bosons, $P(s)$ distribution
shows the Shnirelman peak which exhibits a large number of quasi-degenerate

by the interatomic interaction and the corresponding level fluctuation shows a
transition to Wigner with increase in particle number. It does not follow GOE

realistic system to prove that $\frac{1}{f^{\alpha}}$ noise is ubiquitous in

  applicability of the main theorem (ie, what ensembles may be studied)",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The limiting distribution of eigenvalues of N x N random matrices has many
applications. One of the most studied ensembles are real symmetric matrices
with independent entries iidrv; the limiting rescaled spectral measure (LRSM)
$\widetilde{\mu}$ is the semi-circle. Studies have determined the LRSMs for
many structured ensembles, such as Toeplitz and circulant matrices. These have
very different behavior; the LRSM for both have unbounded support. Given a
structured ensemble such that (i) each random variable occurs o(N) times in
each row and (ii) the LRSM exists, we introduce a parameter to continuously
interpolate between these behaviors. We fix a p in [1/2, 1] and study the
ensemble of signed structured matrices by multiplying the (i,j)-th and (j,i)-th
entries of a matrix by a randomly chosen epsilon_ij in {1, -1}, with
Prob(epsilon_ij = 1) = p (i.e., the Hadamard product). For p = 1/2 we prove
that the limiting signed rescaled spectral measure is the semi-circle. For all
other p, the limiting measure has bounded (resp., unbounded) support if
$\widetilde{\mu}$ has bounded (resp., unbounded) support, and converges to
$\widetilde{\mu}$ as p -> 1. Notably, these results hold for Toeplitz and
circulant matrix ensembles.
  The proofs are by the Method of Moments. The analysis involves the pairings
of 2k vertices on a circle. The contribution of each in the signed case is
weighted by a factor depending on p and the number of vertices involved in at
least one crossing. These numbers appear in combinatorics and knot theory. The
number of configurations with no vertices involved in a crossing is
well-studied, and are the Catalan numbers. We prove similar formulas for
configurations with up to 10 vertices in at least one crossing. We derive a
closed-form expression for the expected value and determine the asymptotics for
the variance for the number of vertices in at least one crossing.

periodic vortex pattern but to the orientation of zero-energy domain walls
separating domains with different orientations of vortex stripes. The phase
transition leading to the destruction of this phase can be associated with the
appearance of free fractional vortices and is of the first order. The
stabilization of the two other ordered phases (existing at lower temperatures)
relies a positive contribution to domain-wall free energy induced by the
presence of spin waves. This effect has a substantial numerical smallness, in
accordance with which these two phases can be observed only in the systems of
really macroscopic sizes. In physical systems (like magnetically frustrated
Josephson junction arrays and superconducting wire networks), the presence of

Ueno","AKARI observations of ice absorption bands towards edge-on YSOs","Accepted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To investigate the composition and evolution of circumstellar ice around
low-mass YSOs, we observed ice absorption bands in the near infrared (NIR)
towards eight YSOs ranging from class 0 to class II, among which seven are
associated with edge-on disks. We performed slit-less spectroscopic
observations using the grism mode of the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board AKARI,
which enables us to obtain full NIR spectra from 2.5 $\mu$m to 5 $\mu$m. The
spectra were fitted with polynomial baselines to derive the absorption spectra.
The molecular absorption bands were then fitted with the laboratory database of
ice absorption bands, considering the instrumental line profile and the
spectral resolution of the grism dispersion element. Towards the class 0-I
sources (L1527, IRC-L1041-2, and IRAS04302), absorption bands of H$_2$O,
CO$_2$, CO, and XCN are clearly detected. Column density ratios of CO$_2$ ice
and CO ice relative to H$_2$O ice are 21-28% and 13-46%, respectively. If XCN
is OCN$^-$, its column density is as high as 2-6% relative to H$_2$O ice. The
HDO ice feature at 4.1 $\mu$m is tentatively detected towards the class 0-I
sources and HV Tau. Non-detections of the CH-stretching mode features around
3.5 $\mu$m provide upper limits to the CH$_3$OH abundance of 26% (L1527) and
42% (IRAS04302) relative to H$_2$O. We tentatively detect OCS ice absorption
towards IRC-L1041-2. Towards class 0-I sources, the detected features should
mostly originate in the cold envelope, while CO gas and OCN$^-$ could originate
in the region close to the protostar, where there are warm temperatures and UV
radiation. We detect H$_2$O ice band towards ASR41 and 2MASSJ1628137-243139,
which are edge-on class II disks. We also detect H$_2$O ice and CO$_2$ ice
towards HV Tau, HK Tau, and UY Aur, and tentatively detect CO gas features
towards HK Tau and UY Aur.

connectivity to wholesale customers in bundles, at rates based on the cost of
the links that the traffic in the bundle is traversing. Although providers have
already begun to implement and deploy tiered pricing contracts, little is known
about how such pricing affects ISPs and their customers. While contracts that
sell connectivity on finer granularities improve market efficiency, they are
also more costly for ISPs to implement and more difficult for customers to
understand. In this work we present two contributions: (1) we develop a novel
way of mapping traffic and topology data to a demand and cost model; and (2) we
fit this model on three large real-world networks: an European transit ISP, a
content distribution network, and an academic research network, and run
counterfactuals to evaluate the effects of different pricing strategies on both
the ISP profit and the consumer surplus. We highlight three core findings.
First, ISPs gain most of the profits with only three or four pricing tiers and
likely have little incentive to increase granularity of pricing even further.
Second, we show that consumer surplus follows closely, if not precisely, the
increases in ISP profit with more pricing tiers. Finally, the common ISP
practice of structuring tiered contracts according to the cost of carrying the
traffic flows (e.g., offering a discount for traffic that is local) can be
suboptimal and that dividing contracts based on both traffic demand and the
cost of carrying it into only three or four tiers yields near-optimal profit
for the ISP.

memory references that are interpreted by a vital compiler analysis, namely
pointer analysis. For a pair of memory references at a program point, a typical
pointer analysis specifies if the points-to relation between them may exist,
definitely does not exist, or definitely exists. The ""may be"" case, which
describes the points-to relation for most of the pairs, cannot be dealt with by
most compiler optimizations. This is so to guarantee the soundness of these
optimizations. However, the ""may be"" case can be capitalized by the modern
class of speculative optimizations if the probability that two memory
references alias can be measured. Focusing on multithreading, a prevailing
technique of programming, this paper presents a new flow-sensitive technique
for probabilistic pointer analysis of multithreaded programs. The proposed
technique has the form of a type system and calculates the probability of every
points-to relation at each program point. The key to our approach is to
calculate the points-to information via a post-type derivation. The use of type
systems has the advantage of associating each analysis results with a
justification (proof) for the correctness of the results. This justification
has the form of a type derivation and is very much required in applications

the diagonal of words of square length arranged in a square array, preserves
regularity but does not preserve context-freeness.

the near-critical plasma strongly increases both the conversion efficiency and
the energy of electrons and leads to enhanced acceleration of proton from a

electrons of the foam are strongly accelerated in the forward direction and
propagate on the rear side of the target building up a high electric field with
a relatively flat longitudinal profile. In these conditions the maximum proton

reduction of biological productivity due to vigorous horizontal stirring in
upwelling areas. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we consider a
system of oceanic flow from the Benguela area coupled with a simple
biogeochemical model of Nutrient-Phyto-Zooplankton (NPZ) type. For the flow
three different surface velocity fields are considered: one derived from
satellite altimetry data, and the other two from a regional numerical model at
two different spatial resolutions. We compute horizontal particle dispersion in
terms of Lyapunov Exponents, and analyzed their correlations with phytoplankton
concentrations. Our modelling approach confirms that in the south Benguela
there is a reduction of biological activity when stirring is increased.
Two-dimensional offshore advection and latitudinal difference in Primary
Production, also mediated by the flow, seem to be the dominant processes
involved. We estimate that mesoscale processes are responsible for 30 to 50% of
the offshore fluxes of biological tracers. In the northern area, other factors
not taken into account in our simulation are influencing the ecosystem. We
suggest explanations for these results in the context of studies performed in
other eastern boundary upwelling areas.

boundary conditions. In particular, we simulate realistic signal systems that
include signal linking and adaptive cycle times, and compare their performance
against a highly adaptive system of self-organizing traffic signals which is
designed to uniformly distribute the network density. We find that for networks
with time-independent boundary conditions, well-defined stationary MFDs are
observed, whose shape depends on the particular signal system used, and also on
the level of heterogeneity in the system. We find that the spatial
heterogeneity of both density and flow provide important indicators of network
performance. We also study networks with time-dependent boundary conditions,
containing morning and afternoon peaks. In this case, intricate hysteresis
loops are observed in the MFDs which are strongly correlated with the density
heterogeneity. Our results show that the MFD of the self-organizing traffic
signals lies above the MFD for the realistic systems, suggesting that by
adaptively homogenizing the network density, overall better performance and
higher capacity can be achieved.

distances, that can be likely or oppositely charged. In all cases, one type of
mobile counter-ions only is present, and ensures electroneutrality (salt free
case). The method is based on a systematic expansion around the ground state
formed by the two-dimensional Wigner crystal(s) of counter-ions at the
plate(s). The leading SC order stems from a single-particle theory, and
coincides with the virial SC approach that has been much studied in the last 10
years. The first correction has the functional form of the virial SC
prediction, but the prefactor is different. The present theory is free of
divergences and the obtained results, both for symmetrically and asymmetrically
charged plates, are in excellent agreement with available data of Monte-Carlo
simulations under strong and intermediate Coulombic couplings. All results
obtained represent relevant improvements over the virial SC estimates. The
present SC theory starting from the Wigner crystal and therefore coined Wigner
SC, sheds light on anomalous phenomena like the counter-ion mediated

standard approaches in massive distributed and parallel computation. In
contrast to its intensive use in practise, theoretical footing is still limited
and only little work has been done yet to put MapReduce on a par with the major
computational models. Following pioneer work that relates the MapReduce
framework with PRAM and BSP in their macroscopic structure, we focus on the
functionality provided by the framework itself, considered in the parallel
external memory model (PEM). In this, we present upper and lower bounds on the
parallel I/O-complexity that are matching up to constant factors for the
shuffle step. The shuffle step is the single communication phase where all
information of one MapReduce invocation gets transferred from map workers to
reduce workers. Hence, we move the focus towards the internal communication
step in contrast to previous work. The results we obtain further carry over to
the BSP* model. On the one hand, this shows how much complexity can be ""hidden""
for an algorithm expressed in MapReduce compared to PEM. On the other hand, our
results bound the worst-case performance loss of the MapReduce approach in

results using smaller samples that the intrinsic (spherical) Y_{500}-M_{500}
relation has very little scatter (sigma_{log_{10}Y}~0.04), is insensitive to
cluster gas physics and evolves to redshift one in accord with self-similar
expectations. Our pre-heating and feedback models predict scaling relations
that are in excellent agreement with the recent analysis from combined Planck
and XMM-Newton data by the Planck Collaboration. This agreement is largely
preserved when r_{500} and M_{500} are derived using the hydrostatic mass
proxy, Y_{X,500}, albeit with significantly reduced scatter
(sigma_{log_{10}Y}~0.02), a result that is due to the tight correlation between
Y_{500} and Y_{X,500}. Interestingly, this assumption also hides any bias in
the relation due to dynamical activity. We also assess the importance of
projection effects from large-scale structure along the line-of-sight, by
extracting cluster Y_{500} values from fifty simulated 5x5 square degree sky
maps. Once the (model-dependent) mean signal is subtracted from the maps we
find that the integrated SZ signal is unbiased with respect to the underlying
clusters, although the scatter in the (cylindrical) Y_{500}-M_{500} relation
increases in the pre-heating case, where a significant amount of energy was
injected into the intergalactic medium at high redshift. Finally, we study the
hot gas pressure profiles to investigate the origin of the SZ signal and find
that the largest contribution comes from radii close to r_{500} in all cases.
The profiles themselves are well described by generalised Navarro, Frenk &
White profiles but there is significant cluster-to-cluster scatter.

result is that unlike the standard cosmology the scale factor may not vanish in
it's evolution back in time. In other words our model displays a cosmological
bounce and avoids the initial singularity. The formula for the scale factor,
leading to the bounce, is only valid for the dust-filled universe and hence
cannot be adequate for the hot stage in the early universe when the bounce
happens. So, the results of this paper are only qualitative in nature and must
be used to obtain initial values for the hot stage of the unverse when one

  Lexington, KY, U.S.A., July 10, 2011",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tabling is an evaluation strategy for Prolog programs that works by storing
answers in a table space and then by using them in similar subgoals. Some
tabling engines use call by subsumption, where it is determined that a subgoal
will consume answers from a more general subgoal in order to reduce the search
space and increase efficiency. We designed an extension, named Retroactive Call
Subsumption (RCS), that implements call by subsumption independently of the
call order, thus allowing a more general subgoal to force previous called
subgoals to become answer consumers. For this extension, we propose a new table
space design, the Single Time Stamped Trie (STST), that is organized to make
answer sharing across subsumed/subsuming subgoals simple and efficient. In this
paper, we present the new STST table space design and we discuss the main
modifications made to the original Time Stamped Tries approach to
non-retroactive call by subsumption. In experimental results, with programs
that stress some deficiencies of the new STST design, some overheads may be
observed, however the results achieved with more realistic programs greatly
offset these overheads.

the design of the table space. The most popular and successful data structure
for representing tables is based on a two-level trie data structure, where one
trie level stores the tabled subgoal calls and the other stores the computed
answers. The Global Trie (GT) is an alternative table space organization
designed with the intent to reduce the tables's memory usage, namely by storing
terms in a global trie, thus preventing repeated representations of the same
term in different trie data structures. In this paper, we propose an extension
to the GT organization, named Global Trie for Subterms (GT-ST), where compound
subterms in term arguments are represented as unique entries in the GT.
Experiments results using the YapTab tabling system show that GT-ST support has
potential to achieve significant reductions on memory usage, for programs with
increasing compound subterms in term arguments, without compromising the
execution time for other programs.

(MB) in the protostellar phase, which prevents the formation of a centrifugal
disk around a nascent protostar. Aims: We determine if non-ideal MHD, including
the effects of ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation determined from a
detailed chemical network model, allows for disk formation at the earliest
stages of star formation (SF). Methods: We employ the axisymmetric thin-disk
approximation in order to resolve a dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude in
length and 16 in density, while also calculating partial ionization using up to
19 species in a detailed chemical equilibrium model. MB is applied using a
steady-state approximation, and a barotropic relation is used to capture the
thermal evolution. Results: We resolve the formation of the first and second
cores, with expansion waves at the periphery of each, a magnetic diffusion
shock, and prestellar infall profiles at larger radii. Power-law profiles in
each region can be understood analytically. After the formation of the second
core, centrifugal support rises rapidly and a low-mass disk of radius ~10 R_Sun
is formed, when the second core has mass ~0.001 M_Sun. The mass-to-flux ratio
is ~10,000 times the critical value in the central region. Conclusions: A small
centrifugal disk can form in the earliest stage of SF, due to a shut-off of MB
caused by magnetic field dissipation in the first core region. There is enough
angular momentum loss to allow the second collapse to occur directly, and a
low-mass stellar core to form with a surrounding disk. The disk mass and size
will depend upon how the angular momentum transport mechanisms within the disk
can keep up with mass infall onto the disk. We estimate that the disk will
remain <~10 AU, undetectable even by ALMA, in the early Class 0 phase.

qualitative features of the protein equilibrium distributions as a function of
the biological parameters in the fast mRNA regime. The performance of the

reflect its purpose and function? In general, one argues that correlations
between specific features and specific functions are key to understanding a
complex structure. However, specific features may sometimes be neutral and
uncorrelated with any system-specific purpose, function or causal chain. Such
neutral features are caused by chance and randomness. Here we compare two
classes of chemical networks: one that has been subjected to biological
evolution (the chemical reaction network of metabolism in living cells) and one
that has not (the atmospheric planetary chemical reaction networks). Their
degree distributions are shown to share the very same neutral
system-independent features. The shape of the broad distributions is to a large
extent controlled by a single parameter, the network size. From this
perspective, there is little difference between atmospheric and metabolic
networks; they are just different sizes of the same random assembling network.
In other words, the shape of the degree distribution is a neutral
characteristic feature and has no functional or evolutionary implications in
itself; it is not a matter of life and death.

to the square-root of the number of base station antennas with no reduction in

the power could be made inversely proportional to the number of antennas. Lower
capacity bounds for maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection are derived. A MRC receiver normally
performs worse than ZF and MMSE. However as power levels are reduced, the
cross-talk introduced by the inferior maximum-ratio receiver eventually falls
below the noise level and this simple receiver becomes a viable option. The
tradeoff between the energy efficiency (as measured in bits/J) and spectral

with predictions from theoretical models. Aims. We aim at predicting the
chemical evolution of P in the Milky Way and compare our results with the
observed P abundances in disk stars in order to put constraints on the P
nucleosynthesis. Methods. To do that we adopt the two-infall model of galactic
chemical evolution, which is a good model for the Milky Way, and compute the
evolution of the abundances of P and Fe. We adopt stellar yields for these
elements from different sources. The element P should have been formed mainly
in Type II supernovae. Finally, Fe is mainly produced by Type Ia supernovae.
Results. Our results confirm that to reproduce the observed trend of [P/Fe] vs.
[Fe/H] in disk stars, P is formed mainly in massive stars. However, none of the
available yields for P can reproduce the solar abundance of this element. In
other words, to reproduce the data one should assume that massive stars produce
more P than predicted by a factor of ~ 3. Conclusions. We conclude that all the
available yields of P from massive stars are largely underestimated and that
nucleosynthesis calculations should be revised. We also predict the [P/Fe]
expected in halo stars.

between this general process with giving a deck of playing cards a shuffle,
here it is referred to as quantum shuffling, showing that the quantum Zeno and
anti-Zeno effects emerge naturally as two time limits. Within this framework, a
connection between the gradual transition from anti-Zeno to Zeno behavior and
the appearance of an underlying Markovian dynamics is found. Accordingly,
although a priori it might result counterintuitive, the quantum Zeno effect
corresponds to a dynamical regime where any trace of knowledge on how the

This would explain why the system apparently does not evolve or decay for a
relatively long time, although it eventually undergoes an exponential decay. By
means of a simple working model, conditions characterizing the shuffling

make necessary the use of some extra assistance from classical methodologies.
Here it is shown how the Bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics removes the

supernova explosion, has long been considered as the possible site for the
synthesis of heavy r-process elements in the Universe. Only recently, it has
been possible to simulate supernova explosions up to ~10 seconds, based on
three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. These simulations show that the
neutrino luminosities and spectra of all flavors are very similar and their
difference even decreases during the deleptonization of the proto-neutron star.
As a consequence, the ejecta are always proton rich which rules out the
possible production of heavy r-process elements (Z>56). We perform a detailed
analysis of the different weak processes that determine the neutrino spectra.
Non-electron flavor (anti)neutrinos are produced and interact only via
neutral-current processes, while electron (anti)neutrinos have additional
contributions from charge-current processes. The latter are dominated by ve
absorption on neutrons and anti-ve absorption on protons. At early times,
charge-current processes are responsible for spectral differences between.
However, as the region of neutrino decoupling moves to higher densities during
deleptonization, charge-current reactions are suppressed by final state
Pauli-blocking. anti-ve absorption on protons is suppressed due to the
continuously increasing chemical potential of the neutrons. ve absorption on
neutrons is blocked by the increasing degeneracy of the electrons. These
effects result in negligible contributions from charge-current reactions on
timescales on the order of tens of seconds, depending on the progenitor star.
Hence, the neutrino spectra are mainly determined from neutral-current
processes which do not distinguish between the different flavors and results in

strongly influenced scientific and technological models. However, in recent
decades, chaos and complexity have shown that not every phenomenon is
predictable, even if it is deterministic. If a problem space is predictable, in
theory we can find a solution via optimization. Nevertheless, if a problem
space is not predictable, or it changes too fast, very probably optimization
will offer obsolete solutions. This occurs often when the immediate solution
affects the problem itself. An alternative is found in adaptation. An adaptive
system will be able to find by itself new solutions for unforeseen situations.

shared keys among the neighbor sensor nodes to create secure communication

factor determining the energy to be consumed by each sensor node during the
secure network configuration. On the other hand, to achieve the optimum network
configuration, nodes may not need to establish pairwise keys with all of their
neighbors. Because, links to be established are defined by the network
configuration protocol and as long as the network connectivity requirements are
satisfied, number of links to be secured can be limited accordingly. In this
sense, key establishment and network configuration performances are related to
each other and this cross relation should be taken into consideration while
implementing security for WSN. In this paper, we have investigated the cross
layer relations and performance figures of the selected randomized
pre-distribution and public key based key establishment protocols with the
configuration protocol we proposed in a separate publication. Simulation
results indicate that total network configuration energy cost can be reduced by
reducing the number of links to be secured without affecting the global network
connectivity performance. Results also show that the energy and resilience
performances of the public key establishment can be better than the key

scale-height-method (shm). It is based on electron density profiles inferred
from White Light (WL) brightness measurements of the corona during solar
eclipses. This method has been applied to several published coronal electron
density models. The calculated temperature distributions reach a maximum at r >
1.3 RS, and therefore do not satisfy one of the conditions for applying the shm
method. Another method is the hydrostatic equilibrium method (hst), which
enables coronal temperature distributions to be determined, providing solutions
to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. The temperature maximas using the hst
method are almost equal to those obtained using the shm method, but the
temperature peak is always at significantly lower altitude when the hst-method
is used than when the shm-method is used. A third and more recently developed
method, dyn, can be used for the same published electron density profiles. The
temperature distributions obtained using the dyn method are regular solutions
of the hydrodynamic equations. They depend on the expansion velocity of the
coronal plasma considered as a free input parameter in the calculations. At the
base of the solar corona, where the coronal bulk velocity is small (subsonic),
the dyn and hst methods give similar temperature values. Larger differences are
found at higher altitudes where the expansion velocity approaches and exceeds
the velocity of sound. This paper shows also the effects of the flow tube
geometry and ion temperatures on the electron temperature distributions. The
dyn method is a generalization of the hst method, where the electron
temperature distribution tends to zero at infinite radial distances. It is a
new diagnostic tool for determining from WL coronal observations the range of
radial distances where the coronal heating rate is at its maximum.

  Devices","10 pages, 15 figures",,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Laser-based electron acceleration is attracting strong interest from the
conventional accelerator community due to its outstanding characteristics in
terms of high initial energy, low emittance and high beam current.
Unfortunately, such beams are currently not comparable to those of conventional
accelerators, limiting their use for the manifold applications that a
traditional accelerator can have. Besides working on the plasma source itself,
a promising approach to shape the laser-generated beams is coupling them with
conventional accelerator elements in order to benefit from both, a versatile
electron source and a controllable beam.
  In this paper we show that some parameters commonly used by the particle
accelerator community must be reconsidered when dealing with laser-plasma
beams. Starting from the parameters of laser-generated electrons which can be
obtained nowadays by conventional multi hundred TW laser systems, we compare
different conventional magnetic lattices able to capture and transport those
GeV electrons. From this comparison we highlight some important limit of the
state-of-the-art plasma generated electrons with respect to conventional
accelerator ones. Eventually we discuss an application of such beams in
undulators for Free Electron Lasers (FELs), which is one of the most demanding
applications in terms of beam quality.

sets in topologically complete metric spaces is non-sigma-porous in the product
space. The main aim of the present paper is to answer the natural question
whether a similar result can be proved for lower porosity. It apears the answer
is no, as we construct closed non-sigma-lower porous subsets of the real line A
and B such that the Cartesian product of A and B is lower porous. In the
present article we provide an example of two closed non-sigma-lower porous sets
with lower porous product. On the other hand, we prove the following: Let X and
Y be topologically complete metric spaces, let A be a non-sigma-lower porous
Suslin subset of X and let B be a non-sigma-porous Suslin subset of Y. Then the
product of A and B is non-sigma-lower porous. We also provide a brief summary
of some basic properties of lower porosity, including a simple characterization
of Suslin non-sigma-lower porous sets in topologically complete metric spaces.

N complex block matrix in terms of its constituent blocks. The result allows
one to reduce the determinant of a matrix with N^2 blocks to the product of the
determinants of N distinct combinations of single blocks. This procedure proves
useful in the analytic description of physical systems with multiple discrete
variables, as it provides a systematic method for evaluating determinants which
might otherwise be analytically intractable.

Practice (CoPs) and to capitalise on all their knowledge. This platform
addresses CoPs interested in a same general activity, for example tutoring. For
that purpose, we propose a general model of Interconnection of Communities of
Practice (ICP), based on the concept of Constellation of Practice (CCP)
developed by Wenger (1998). The model of ICP was implemented and has been used
to develop the TE-Cap 2 platform which has, as its field of application,
educational tutoring activities. In particular, we propose an indexation and
search tool for the ICP knowledge base. The TE-Cap 2 platform has been used in
real conditions. We present the main results of this descriptive investigation
to validate this work.
