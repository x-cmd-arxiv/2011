  University Budapest, Hungary",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis the two-particle-irreducible (2PI) formalism is investigated
with several applications, particular emphasis on renormalizability.
  In the O(N) symmetric scalar quantum field theory formulated with auxiliary
fields it is pointed out that, statements recently appeared in the literature
which raised doubts on renormalizability, are wrong. Counterterms are
constructed in details in the NLO of the large-N expansion. The
renormalizability is demonstrated at the same level of the approximation also
with eliminating the auxiliary field.
  In the one component \phi^4 model (at T=0) a method using renormalization
conditions is developed, which gives directly finite equations for the 1- and
2-point functions. This solves the problems of numerical precision of the
counterterm formulated renormalization. In the two-loop 2PI approximation the
equivalence of the new method and the procedure formulated with counterterms is
shown, both analytically and numerically. For the counterterm method also a new
algorithm is developed, which accelerates the numerical convergence.
  In the U(N)xU(N) model, an approximate solution of the field equations in the
large-N limit is found in the broken phase, for a condensate proportional to
the unit matrix. The approximation assumes the presence of a mass-hierarchy
between the scalar and pseudoscalar fields. The validity of the latter
assumption is investigated in the whole parameter space numerically. The
stability of the solution against a more general condensate is checked. It is
shown that, there exists a region of the parameter space, where the condensate
corresponding to the ""8"" direction of the SU(3) classification can arise
spontaneously. This solution is found to be metastable, but could transform
into the true ground state, when a moderate external source is applied along
the ""8"" direction.

partitioning and multiclass labeling problems, which has recently proven quite
successful and can be seen as a continuous analogue of Linear Programming (LP)
relaxation methods for finite-dimensional problems. While for the latter case
several optimality bounds are known, to our knowledge no such bounds exist in
the continuous setting. We provide such a bound by analyzing a probabilistic
rounding method, showing that it is possible to obtain an integral solution of
the original partitioning problem from a solution of the relaxed problem with
an a priori upper bound on the objective, ensuring the quality of the result
from the viewpoint of optimization. The approach has a natural interpretation
as an approximate, multiclass variant of the celebrated coarea formula.

distribution by acoustic waves traveling in the plasma of the early universe.
Their detection at the expected scale in large-scale structures strongly
supports current cosmological models with a nearly linear evolution from
redshift approximately 1000, and the existence of dark energy. Besides, BAOs
provide a standard ruler for studying cosmic expansion. In this paper we focus
on methods for BAO detection using the correlation function measurement. For
each method, we want to understand the tested hypothesis (the hypothesis H0 to
be rejected) and the underlying assumptions. We first present wavelet methods
which are mildly model-dependent and mostly sensitive to the BAO feature. Then
we turn to fully model-dependent methods. We present the most often used method
based on the chi^2 statistic, but we find it has limitations. In general the
assumptions of the chi^2 method are not verified, and it only gives a rough
estimate of the significance. The estimate can become very wrong when
considering more realistic hypotheses, where the covariance matrix of the
measurement depends on cosmological parameters. Instead we propose to use a new
method based on two modifications: we modify the procedure for computing the
significance and make it rigorous, and we modify the statistic to obtain better
results in the case of varying covariance matrix. We verify with simulations
that correct significances are different from the ones obtained using the
classical chi^2 procedure. We also test a simple example of varying covariance
matrix. In this case we find that our modified statistic outperforms the
classical chi^2 statistic when both significances are correctly computed.
Finally we find that taking into account variations of the covariance matrix
can change both BAO detection levels and cosmological parameter constraints.

$\gamma(T)$ may either increase or decrease on warming even for a single band

2 Fe per unit cell, one can qualitatively understand the pairing symmetry of
several families of iron-based superconductors. In iron-pnictides and
iron-chalcogenides, the nodeless s+- pairing and the resulting magnetic
resonance mode transform nicely between the two unit cells, while retaining all
physical properties unchanged. However, when the electron-pocket disappears
from the Fermi surface with complete doping in KFe2As2, we find that the
unit-cell invariant requirement prohibits the occurrence of s+- pairing
symmetry (caused by inter-hole-pocket nesting). However, the intra-pocket
nesting is compatible here, which leads to a nodal d-wave pairing. The
corresponding Fermi surface topology and the pairing symmetry are similar to
Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductors. Furthermore, when the Fermi surface
hosts only electron-pockets in KyFe2-xSe2, the inter-electron-pocket nesting
induces a nodeless and isotropic d-wave pairing. This situation is analogous to
the electron-doped cuprates, where the strong antiferromagnetic order creates
similar disconnected electron-pocket Fermi surface, and hence nodeless d-wave
pairing appears. The unit-cell transformation in KyFe2-xSe2 exhibits that the
d-wave pairing breaks the translational symmetry of the 2 Fe unit cell, and
thus cannot be realized unless a vacancy ordering forms to compensate for it.
These results are consistent with the coexistence picture of a competing order
and nodeless d-wave superconductivity in both cuprates and KyFe1.6Se2.

performed dielectric constant measurements under magnetic field that clearly
exhibit a metamagnetic transition, and thus confirm these predictions. On the
other hand careful magnetization measurements show a small by non null FM
component along the c-axis direction. Finally the Landau analysis within the
P6'3 magnetic group shows that only the polarization square is coupled to the
magnetic orders and thus neither the magnetization nor the AFM order can be
reversed by an applied electric field.

used for the chaos control in the central parts of elliptical galaxy. Numerical
experiments in the 2D system show a very complicated phase plane with a large
chaotic sea, considerable sticky layers and a large number of islands, produced
by secondary resonances. When the mass of the disk increases, the chaotic
regions decrease gradually, and, finally, a new phase plane with only regular
orbits appears. This evolution indicates that disks in elliptical galaxies can
act as the chaos controllers. Starting from the results obtained in the 2D
system, we locate the regions in the phase space of the 3D system, producing
regular and chaotic orbits. For this we introduce and use a new dynamical
parameter, the S(w) spectrum, which proves to be useful as a fast indicator and
allows us to distinguish the regular motion from chaos in the 3D potentials.
Other methods for detecting chaos are also discussed.

Tauri star system V773 Tau over the 2003 -- 2009 period. With these data we
derive relative astrometry, photometry between the A and B components, and
radial velocity (RV) of the A-subsystem components. Combining these new data
with previously published astrometry and RVs, we update the relative A-B orbit
model. This updated orbit model, the known system distance, and A subsystem
parameters yields a dynamical mass for the B component for the first time.
Remarkably the derived B dynamical mass is in the range of 1.7 -- 3.0 M$_\sun$.
This is much higher than previous estimates, and suggests that like A, B is
also a multiple stellar system.
  Among these data, spatially-resolved spectroscopy provide new insight into
the nature of the B component. Similar to A, these near-IR spectra indicate
that the dominant source in B is of mid-K spectral type. If B is in fact a
multiple star system as suggested by the dynamical mass estimate, the simplest
assumption is that B is composed of similar $\sim$ 1.2 M$_\sun$ PMS stars in a
close ($<$ 1 AU) binary system. This inference is supported by line-shape
changes in near-IR spectroscopy of B, tentatively interpreted as changing RV
among components in V773 Tau B.
  Relative photometry indicate that B is highly variable in the near-IR. The
most likely explanation for this variability is circum-B material resulting in
variable line-of-sight extinction. The distribution of this material must be
significantly affected by both the putative B multiplicity, and the A-B orbit.

exoplanet mis-identification as possible causes of both the excess emission and
its correlation with expected planetary temperature. Although we find no single

albedos, with a general trend of increasing planetary albedos with decreasing
atmospheric temperatures, is able to explain most of the systems. We estimate
an 11% false positive rate in the current Kepler planet candidate sample of hot

theoretical justification for inverse variance weighting in this context, and
contrasts with analogous results for conditional moment equalities in which
optimal weighting only affects the asymptotic variance. Second, the new
weighting changes the asymptotic behavior, including the rate of convergence,
of the KS statistic itself, requiring a new asymptotic theory in choosing the
critical value, which I provide. To make these comparisons, I derive rates of

improvement by showing that the new tests can detect alternatives that converge
to points on the identified set at a faster rate than those detected by

understanding of planets because their mass, radius, and mass density can be
determined. The CoRoT space mission allows us to achieve a very high
photometric accuracy. By combining CoRoT data with high-precision radial
velocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. We report
the discovery of CoRoT-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactive
F9V-type star with a period of four days. After excluding alternative physical
configurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radius
and mass of the planet by combining CoRoT photometry with high-resolution
spectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs SOPHIE, HARPS, FIES, and
SANDIFORD. To improve the precision of its ephemeris and the epoch, we observed
additional transits with the TRAPPIST and Euler telescopes. Using HARPS spectra
obtained during the transit, we then determine the projected angle between the
spin of the star and the orbit of the planet. We find that the host star of
CoRoT-19b is an inactive F9V-type star close to the end of its main-sequence
life. The host star has a mass M*=1.21+/-0.05 Msun and radius R*=1.65+/-0.04
Rsun. The planet has a mass of Mp=1.11+/-0.06 Mjup and radius of Rp=1.29+/-0.03
Rjup. The resulting bulk density is only rho=0.71+/-0.06 gcm-3, which is much
lower than that for Jupiter. The exoplanet CoRoT-19b is an example of a giant
planet of almost the same mass as Jupiter but a 30% larger radius.

fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow is presented. The
focus is made on the fluctuations of the spatial (Eulerian) and temporal
(Lagrangian) velocity increments. The universal nature of the intermittency
phenomenon as observed in experimental measurements and numerical simulations
is shown to be fully taken into account by the multiscale picture proposed by
the multifractal formalism, and its extensions to the dissipative scales and to
the Lagrangian framework. The article is devoted to the presentation of these
arguments and to their comparisons against empirical data. In particular,
explicit predictions of the statistics, such as probability density functions
and high order moments, of the velocity gradients and acceleration are derived.
In the Eulerian framework, at a given Reynolds number, they are shown to depend
on a single parameter function called the singularity spectrum and to a
universal constant governing the transition between the inertial and
dissipative ranges. The Lagrangian singularity spectrum compares well with its
Eulerian counterpart by a transformation based on incompressibility,
homogeneity and isotropy and the remaining constant is shown to be difficult to
estimate on empirical data. It is finally underlined the limitations of the
increment to quantify accurately the singular nature of Lagrangian velocity.
This is confirmed using higher order increments unbiased by the presence of
linear trends, as they are observed on velocity along a trajectory.

  Amplification",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dodis and Wichs introduced the notion of a non-malleable extractor to study
the problem of privacy amplification with an active adversary. A non-malleable
extractor is a much stronger version of a strong extractor. Previously, there
are only two known constructions of non-malleable extractors. Both
constructions only work for (n, k)-sources with k>n/2. Interestingly, both
constructions are also two-source extractors.
  In this paper, we present a strong connection between non-malleable
extractors and two-source extractors. The first part of the connection shows
that non-malleable extractors can be used to construct two-source extractors.
With appropriate parameters the resulted two-source extractor beats the best
known construction of two-source extractors. This partially explains why
previous constructions of non-malleable extractors only work for sources with
entropy rate >1/2, and why explicit non-malleable extractors for small
min-entropy may be hard to get. The second part of the connection shows that
certain two-source extractors can be used to construct non-malleable
extractors. Using this connection, we obtain the first construction of
non-malleable extractors for k < n/2. Specifically, we give an unconditional
construction for min-entropy k=(1/2-\delta)n for some constant \delta>0, and a
conditional (semi-explicit) construction that can potentially achieve k=\alpha
n for any constant \alpha>0.
  Finally, despite the lack of explicit non-malleable extractors for
arbitrarily linear entropy, we give the first 2-round privacy amplification
protocol with asymptotically optimal entropy loss and communication complexity
for (n, k) sources with k=\alpha n for any constant \alpha>0. This dramatically
improves previous results and answers an open problem in \cite{DLWZ11}.

two independent calibrations allowed us to easily identify emission lines in

Our frequency comb precision was limited by modal noise and detector effects,

The standard deviation in the dispersion solution residuals from the

rates and rich star cluster populations, but the rapidly changing tidal field
can also efficiently destroy clusters. We use numerical simulations of merging
disc galaxies to investigate which mechanism dominates. The simulations include
a model for the formation and dynamical disruption of the entire star cluster
population. We find that the dynamical heating of clusters by tidal shocks is
about an order of magnitude higher in interacting galaxies than in isolated
galaxies. This is driven by the increased gas density, and is sufficient to
destroy star clusters at a higher rate than new clusters are formed: the total
number of clusters in the merger remnant is 2-50% of the amount in the
progenitor discs, with low-mass clusters being disrupted preferentially. By
adopting observationally motivated selection criteria, we find that the
observed surplus of star clusters in nearby merging galaxies is caused by the
bias to detect young, massive clusters. We provide a general expression for the
survival fraction of clusters, which increases with the gas depletion
time-scale. Due to the preferential disruption of low-mass clusters, the mass
distribution of the surviving star clusters in a merger remnant develops a peak
at a mass of about 10^3 Msun, which evolves to higher masses at a rate of
0.3-0.4 dex per Gyr. The peak mass initially depends weakly on the
galactocentric radius, but this correlation disappears as the system ages. We
discuss the similarities between the cluster populations of the simulated
merger remnants and (young) globular cluster systems. Our results suggest that
the combination of cluster formation and destruction should be widespread in
the dense star-forming environments at high redshifts, which could provide a
natural origin to present-day globular cluster systems.

foreground contamination from Milky Way (MW) stars, noting that MW substructure
is evident in this contaminant sample. We also filter M31 halo field giant
stars, and identify the remainder as probable dSph members. We then use these
members to determine the kinematical properties of the dSphs. For the first
time, we confirm that And XVIII, XXI, and XXII show kinematics consistent with
bound, dark matter-dominated galaxies. From the velocity dispersions for the
full sample of dSphs we determine masses, which we combine with the size and
luminosity of the galaxies to produce mass-size-luminosity scaling relations.
With these scalings we determine that the M31 dSphs are fully consistent with
the MW dSphs, suggesting that the well-studied MW satellite population provides
a fair sample for broader conclusions. We also estimate dark matter halo masses
of the satellites, and find that there is no sign that the luminosity of these
galaxies depends on their dark halo mass, a result consistent with what is seen
for MW dwarfs. Two of the M31 dSphs (And XV, XVI) have estimated maximum
circular velocities smaller than 12 km/s (to 1sigma), which likely places them
within the lowest mass dark matter halos known to host stars (along with Bootes
I of the MW). Finally, we use the systemic velocities of the M31 satellites to
estimate the total mass of the M31 halo: within 139 kpc, M31's mass is 8 +4.1 -
3.7 x 10^11 corresponding to a virial mass for M31's dark matter halo of 1.2

brightness. By assuming that the embedded OB stars drive out most of the gas
after a given time delay, the change of the surface brightness of expanding
star clusters is studied. The influence of stellar dynamics and stellar
evolution is discussed. The growth of the core radii of such models shows a
remarkable core re-virialisation. The decrease of the surface mass density
during gas expulsion is large and is only truncated by this re-virialisation
process. However, the surface brightness within a certain radius does not
increase noticeably. Thus, an embedded star cluster cannot reappear in

the intuition that the same low energy degrees of freedom which control low
temperature thermal physics are also responsible for the long range

proposed scaling form and determine the scaling function for certain classes of
gapless systems whose low energy physics is described by a conformal field
theory. We also use our crossover formalism to argue that local systems which
are ""natural"" can violate the boundary law at most logarithmically. In
particular, we show that several non-Fermi liquid phases of matter have
entanglement entropy that is at most of order $L^{d-1}\log{(L)} $ for a region

the signal is neither a stochastic background nor perfectly resolvable in its

galaxies by modeling the evolution of their stellar populations in a
hierarchical context. We investigate how a realistic red sequence population
set up by z~1 evolves under different assumptions for the merger and star
formation histories, comparing changes in color, luminosity and mass. The
purely passive fading of existing red sequence galaxies, with no further
mergers or star formation, results in dramatic changes at the bright end of the
luminosity function and color-magnitude relation. Without mergers there is too
much evolution in luminosity at a fixed space density compared to observations.
The change in color and magnitude at a fixed mass resemble that of a passively
evolving population that formed relatively recently, at z~2. Mergers amongst
the red sequence population (""dry mergers"") occurring after z=1 build up mass,
counteracting the fading of the existing stellar populations to give smaller
changes in both color and luminosity for massive galaxies. By allowing some
galaxies to migrate from the blue cloud onto the red sequence after z=1 through
gas-rich mergers, younger stellar populations are added to the red sequence.
This manifestation of the progenitor bias increases the scatter in age and
results in even smaller changes in color and luminosity between z=1 and z=0 at
a fixed mass. The resultant evolution appears much slower, resembling the
passive evolution of a population that formed at high redshift (z~3-5) and is
in closer agreement with observations. Measurements of the luminosity and color
evolution alone are not sufficient to distinguish between the purely passive
evolution of an old population and cosmologically motivated hierarchical
growth, although these scenarios have very different implications for the mass
growth of early-type galaxies over the last half of cosmic history.

predicted by linearly extrapolating the widely-used correlations between black
hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the host
galaxy. Although these correlations remain useful for predicting black hole
masses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest that
different evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxies

trapped in long-lived quasistationary states which have lifetimes that diverge
with the system size. In this work, we address the question of how a long-range
system in a quasistationary state (QSS) responds to an external perturbation.
We consider a long-range system that evolves under deterministic Hamilton
dynamics. The perturbation is taken to couple to the canonical coordinates of
the individual constituents. Our study is based on analyzing the Vlasov
equation for the single-particle phase space distribution. The QSS represents
stable stationary solution of the Vlasov equation in the absence of the
external perturbation. In the presence of small perturbation, we linearize the
perturbed Vlasov equation about the QSS to obtain a formal expression for the
response observed in a single-particle dynamical quantity. For a QSS that is
homogeneous in the coordinate, we obtain an explicit formula for the response.
We apply our analysis to a paradigmatic model, the Hamiltonian mean-field
model, that involves particles moving on a circle under Hamilton dynamics. Our
prediction for the response of three representative QSSs in this model (the
water-bag QSS, the Fermi-Dirac QSS, and the Gaussian QSS) is found to be in
good agreement with $N$-particle simulations for large $N$. We also show the
long-time relaxation of the water-bag QSS to the Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium
state.

of algebraically closed fields is of abelian type. Given a field extension
$K/k$ and a motive $M$ over $k$, we also show that $M$ is finite-dimensional if

Chow--Kuenneth decompositions for varieties that become isomorphic to an

sources are popularly suggested to be candidates for SMBH mergers with spin
flip of jet-ejecting SMBHs. Here we investigate the spectral and spatial
observational signatures of the recoiling SMBHs in radio sources undergoing
black hole spin flip. Our results show that SMBHs in most spin-flip radio

biased to be with high Doppler-shifted broad emission lines while recoiling
radio galaxies are biased to large apparent spatial off-center displacements.
We also calculate the distribution functions of line-of-sight velocity and
apparent spatial off-center for spin-flip radio sources with different apparent
jet reorientation angles. Our results show that the larger the apparent jet
reorientation angle is, the larger the Doppler-shifting recoiling velocity and
apparent spatial off-center displacement will be. We investigate the effects of
recoiling velocity on the dust torus in spin-flip radio sources and suggest

includes six-dimensional tensor multiplets for which the (anti-) self-duality

higher curvature couplings which are considered to establish the full map

moving to the five-dimensional Coulomb branch after circle reduction and
integrating out massive vector multiplets and matter hypermultiplets. The
associated fermions then generate additional Chern-Simons couplings at
one-loop. Further couplings involving the graviphoton are induced by quantum
corrections due to excited Kaluza-Klein modes. On the M-theory side integrating

masses greater than 10^10 M_\odot from the GALEX Arecibo SDSS (GASS) survey.
These galaxies have both HI and H_2 mass measurements. The average metallicity
profile is strikingly flat out to R_90, the radius enclosing 90% of the r-band
light. Metallicity profiles which decline steadily with radius are found
primarily for galaxies in our sample with low stellar mass (Log(M_*)<10.2),
concentration, and/or mean stellar mass density. Beyond ~R_90, however, around
10 percent of the galaxies in our sample exhibit a sharp downturn in
metallicity. Remarkably, we find that the magnitude of the outer metallicity
drop is well correlated with the total HI content of the galaxy (measured as
f_HI=M_HI/M_*). We examine the radial profiles of stellar population ages and
star formation rate densities, and conclude that the galaxies with largest
outer metallicity drops are actively growing their stellar disks, with mass
doubling times across the whole disk only one third as long as a typical GASS
galaxy. We also describe a correlation between local stellar mass density and
metallicity, which is valid across all galaxies in our sample. We argue that
much of the recent stellar mass growth at the edges of these galaxies can be
linked to the accretion or radial transport of relatively pristine gas from
beyond the galaxies' stellar disks.

around young, low mass (<1.5 M_sun) stars by photoevaporation from the central
object's energetic radiation, which considers the far-ultraviolet as well as
the X-ray component of the radiation field. We present analytical scaling
relations and derive estimates for the total mass-loss rates, as well as
discussing the existence of similarity solutions for flows from primordial
discs and discs with inner holes. Furthermore, we perform numerical
calculations, which span a wide range of parameter space and allow us to
provide accurate scalings of the mass-loss rates with the physical parameters
of the systems (X-ray and FUV luminosity, stellar mass, disc mass, disc
temperature and inner hole radius).
  The model suggest that the X-ray component dominates the photoevaporative
mass-loss rates from the inner disc. The mass-loss rates have values in the
range from 10e-11 to 10e-7 M_sun/yr and scale linearly with X-ray luminosity,
with only a weak dependence on the other parameters explored. However, in the
case of high FUV to X-ray (L_FUV/L_X>100) luminosity ratios, the FUV constricts
the X-ray flow and may dominate the mass-loss.
  Simulations of low mass discs with inner holes demonstrate a further stage of
disc clearing, which we call `thermal sweeping'. This process occurs when the
mid-plane pressure drops to sufficiently low values. At this stage a bound,
warm, X-ray heated region becomes sufficiently large and unstable, such that
the remaining disc material is cleared on approximately dynamical time-scales.
This process significantly reduces the time taken to clear the outer regions of
the disc, resulting in an expected transition disc population that will be
dominated by accreting objects, as indicated by recent observations.

for the first time the realistic application of MT2-based measurement methods

maximal combinatorial uncertainty. Several problems arise in such an analysis:
the MT2 variables are powerful but fragile, with shallow edges that are easily
washed out or faked by ubiquitous combinatorics background. Traditional methods
of both cleaning up the distribution and determining edge position can fail
badly. To perform successful mass measurements we introduce several new
techniques: the Edge-to-Bump method of extracting an edge from a distribution
by analyzing a distribution of fits rather than a single fit; a very simple yet
high-yield method for determining decay-chain assignments event-by-event; and a
systematic procedure to obtain MT2 edge measurements in the presence of heavy
combinatorics background, they key element being the parallel use of at least
two independent methods of reducing combinatorics background to avoid fake
measurements. All of these techniques are developed in a Monte Carlo study of
the decay gluino gluino -> 2 sbottom + 2 b -> 4 b + 2 chi_0^1 and verified in a

evolution of the n-point functions of the Wilson lines (the QCD scattering
amplitudes in the eikonal approximation) admit a controlled mean field
approximation of the Gaussian type, for any value of the number of colors Nc.
This approximation is strictly correct in the weak scattering regime at
relatively large transverse momenta, where it reproduces the BFKL dynamics, and
in the strong scattering regime deeply at saturation, where it properly
describes the evolution of the scattering amplitudes towards the respective
black disk limits. The approximation scheme is fully specified by giving the
2-point function (the S-matrix for a color dipole), which in turn can be
related to the solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, including at finite
Nc. Any higher n-point function with n greater than or equal to 4 can be
computed in terms of the dipole S-matrix by solving a closed system of
evolution equations (a simplified version of the respective Balitsky-JIMWLK
equations) which are local in the transverse coordinates. For simple
configurations of the projectile in the transverse plane, our new results for
the 4-point and the 6-point functions coincide with the high-energy
extrapolations of the respective results in the McLerran-Venugopalan model. One
cornerstone of our construction is a symmetry property of the JIMWLK evolution,
that we notice here for the first time: the fact that, with increasing energy,
a hadron is expanding its longitudinal support symmetrically around the
light-cone. This corresponds to invariance under time reversal for the
scattering amplitudes.

$e^+e^-$ collider employs a Crab Waist Crossing, ultra low emittance damped

oriented silicon steel/concrete dipoles. The $p{\bar{p}}$ collider uses the
high intensity Fermilab $\bar{p}$ source, exploits high cross sections for
$p\bar{p}$ production of high mass states, and uses 2 Tesla ultra low carbon

ramps the $p{\bar{p}}$ magnets at 8 Hz every 0.4 seconds, uses 250 GV of SRF,

importantly America, to stay relevant and competitive in the international

large-scale high latitude flows, including Coriolis forces, turbulent diffusion
of momentum and gyroscopic pumping. Side boundaries of the spherical 'polar
cap', our computational domain, are located at latitudes $\geq 60^{\circ}$.
Implementing observed low latitude flows as side boundary conditions, we solve
the flow equations for a cartesian analog of the polar cap. The key parameter
that determines whether there are nodes in the high latitude meridional flow is
$\epsilon=2 \Omega n \pi H^2/\nu$, in which $\Omega$ is the interior rotation
rate, n the radial wavenumber of the meridional flow, $H$ the depth of the
convection zone and $\nu$ the turbulent viscosity. The smaller the $\epsilon$
(larger turbulent viscosity), the fewer the number of nodes in high latitudes.
For all latitudes within the polar cap, we find three nodes for
$\nu=10^{12}{\rm cm}^2{\rm s}^{-1}$, two for $10^{13}$, and one or none for
$10^{15}$ or higher. For $\nu$ near $10^{14}$ our model exhibits 'node
merging': as the meridional flow speed is increased, two nodes cancel each
other, leaving no nodes. On the other hand, for fixed flow speed at the
boundary, as $\nu$ is increased the poleward most node migrates to the pole and
disappears, ultimately for high enough $\nu$ leaving no nodes. These results
suggest that primary poleward surface meridional flow can extend from
$60^{\circ}$ to the pole either by node-merging or by node migration and
disappearance.

much of our understanding of mechanical response and phonon structure of real

$d$-dimensional lattices with $z=2d$ are at the threshold of mechanical
stability and are isostatic. Lattices with $z<2d$ exhibit zero-frequency
""floppy"" modes that provide avenues for lattice collapse. The physics of
systems as diverse as architectural structures, network glasses, randomly
packed spheres, and biopolymer networks is strongly influenced by a nearby
isostatic lattice. We explore elasticity and phonons of a special class of
two-dimensional isostatic lattices constructed by distorting the kagome
lattice. We show that the phonon structure of these lattices, characterized by
vanishing bulk moduli and thus negative Poisson ratios and auxetic elasticity,
depends sensitively on boundary conditions and on the nature of the kagome
distortions. We construct lattices that under free boundary conditions exhibit
surface floppy modes only or a combination of both surface and bulk floppy
modes; and we show that bulk floppy modes present under free boundary
conditions are also present under periodic boundary conditions but that surface
modes are not. In the the long-wavelength limit, the elastic theory of all

(QKD) promises the unconditionally secure distribution of cryptographic keys.
However, in practical realisations, a QKD protocol is only secure, when the
quantum bit error rate introduced by an eavesdropper unavoidably exceeds the
system error rate. This condition guarantees that an eavesdropper cannot
disguise his presence by simply replacing the original transmission line with a
less faulty one. Unfortunately, this condition also limits the possible
distance between the communicating parties, Alice and Bob, to a few hundred
kilometers. To overcome this problem, we design a QKD protocol which allows
Alice and Bob to distinguish system errors from eavesdropping errors. If they
are able to identify the origin of their errors, they can detect eavesdropping
even when the system error rate exceeds the eavesdropping error rate. To
achieve this, the proposed protocol employs an alternative encoding of
information in two-dimensional photon states. Errors manifest themselves as
quantum bit and as index transmission errors with a distinct correlation
between them in case of intercept-resend eavesdropping. As a result, Alice and
Bob can tolerate lower eavesdropping and higher system error rates without
compromising their privacy.

studying weighted social relationships, we observe that while strong

function such as sum, which aggregates edge weights into a path weight,
capturing some notion of quality. We are then interested in finding the top-k

the {\it C. elegans} crawling gait on lubricated surfaces have been scarce,
primarily due to difficulties in estimating the physical features at the
nematode-gel interface. Using kinematic data and a hydrodynamic model based on
lubrication theory, we calculate both the surface drag forces and the
nematode's bending force while crawling on the surface of agar gels. We find
that the normal and tangential surface drag force coefficients during crawling
are approximately 220 and 22, respectively, and the drag coefficient ratio is
approximately 10. During crawling, the calculated internal bending force is
time-periodic and spatially complex, exhibiting a phase lag with respect to the
nematode's body bending curvature. This phase lag is largely due to viscous
drag forces, which are higher during crawling as compared to swimming in an
aqueous buffer solution. The spatial patterns of bending force generated during
either swimming or crawling correlate well with previously described
gait-specific features of calcium signals in muscle. Further, our analysis
indicates that changes in the motility gait of {\it C. elegans} is most likely
due to the nematode's adaptive response to environments characterized by

computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology
has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory

useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems
have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the
computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is

  Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based

informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when
embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions
to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy
yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse
structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general
tasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how

counting of BPS invariants for generic toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. We discuss
how cluster transformations provide an efficient recursive method for computing
pyramid partition functions and show that the recursion is equivalent to the

are related to Seiberg dualities, and we offer complimentary characterizations
of these transitions in terms of the motion of zonotopes and duality webs. Our
methods apply to completely general geometries including those with vanishing
4-cycles, which are associated to chiral quivers, thus overcoming one of the
main limitations in the existing literature. We illustrate our ideas with
explicit results for the infinite family of L^{a,b,c} geometries, dP_2,
pseudo-dP_2, and dP_3. The counting of pyramid partitions for dP_1 gives rise
to the Somos-4 sequence, while dP_2 and pseudo-dP_2 generate the Somos-5

many cores and multi-gigabytes of memory, scaling the internal data structures
of file systems has taken greater importance and urgency. A doubly-linked list
is a simple and very commonly used data structure in file systems but it is not
very friendly to multi-threaded use. While special cases of lists, such as
queues and stacks, have lock-free versions that scale reasonably well, the
general form of a doubly-linked list offers no such solution. Using a mutex to
serialize all operations remains the de-facto method of maintaining a doubly
linked list. This severely limits the scalability of the list and developers
must resort to ad-hoc workarounds that involve using multiple smaller lists
(with individual locks) and deal with the resulting complexity of the system.
In this paper, we present an approach to building highly concurrent data
structures, with special focus on the implementation of highly concurrent
doubly-linked lists. Dubbed ""advanced doubly-linked list"" or ""adlist"" for
short, our list allows iteration in any direction, and insert/delete operations
over non-overlapping nodes to execute in parallel. Operations with common nodes
get serialized so as to always present a locally consistent view to the
callers. An adlist node needs an additional 8 bytes of space for keeping
synchronization information. The Data Domain File System makes extensive use of
adlists which has allowed for significant scaling of the system without
sacrificing simplicity.

lower bounds for eigenvalues. The main idea is to use nonconforming finite
element methods. The general conclusion herein is that if local approximation
properties of nonconforming finite element spaces $V_h$ are better than global
continuity properties of $V_h$, corresponding methods will produce lower bounds
for eigenvalues. More precisely, under three conditions on continuity and
approximation properties of nonconforming finite element spaces we first show
abstract error estimates of approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
Subsequently, we propose one more condition and prove that it is sufficient to
guarantee nonconforming finite element methods to produce lower bounds for
eigenvalues of symmetric elliptic operators. As one application, we show that
this condition hold for most nonconforming elements in literature. As another
important application, this condition provides a guidance to modify known
nonconforming elements in literature and to propose new nonconforming elements.
In fact, we enrich locally the Crouzeix-Raviart element such that the new
element satisfies the condition; we propose a new nonconforming element for
second order elliptic operators and prove that it will yield lower bounds for
eigenvalues. Finally, we prove the saturation condition for most nonconforming
elements.

absolute cross section measurement for the 9Be(gamma,n)8Be reaction conducted
using a highly-efficient, 3He-based neutron detector and nearly-monoenergetic
photon beams, covering energies from E_gamma = 1.5 MeV to 5.2 MeV, produced by
the High Intensity gamma-ray Source of Triangle Universities Nuclear
Laboratory. In the astrophysically important threshold energy region, the
present cross sections are 40% larger than those found in most previous
measurements and are accurate to +/- 10% (95% confidence). The revised
thermonuclear alpha(alpha n,gamma)9Be reaction rate could have implications for
the r-process in explosive environments such as Type II supernovae.

theory is used to derive a pair of transport equations for the shock strength

precursor disturbances that overtake the shock from behind. The asymptotic
behaviour of both the discontinuities is completely analysed. It is noticed
that the decay of a first order discontinuity is much faster than the decay of
the shock; indeed, if the amplitude of the accompanying discontinuity is small
then the shock decays faster as compared to the case when the amplitude of the
first order discontinuity is finite (not necessarily small). It is shown that
for a weak shock, the precursor disturbance evolves like an acceleration wave
at the leading order. We show that the asymptotic decay laws for weak shocks

using the theory of nonlinear geometrical optics, the theory of simple waves

follows that the relatively undistorted wave approximation is a consequence of

statement for resonators with long but finite branches that we call ""finite
waveguides"". Although now there is no essential spectrum and all eigenfunctions
have finite L2 norm, the trapping can be understood as an exponential decay of
the eigenfunction inside the branches. We describe a general variational
formalism for detecting trapped modes in such resonators. For finite waveguides
with general cylindrical branches, we obtain a sufficient condition which
determines the minimal length of branches for getting a trapped eigenmode.
Varying the branch lengths may switch certain eigenmodes from non-trapped to
trapped states. These concepts are illustrated for several typical waveguides
(L-shape, bent strip, crossing of two stripes, etc.). We conclude that the
well-established theory of trapping in infinite waveguides may be incomplete

the expected time, thus confirming the general relativistic precession in the
binary black hole system. This result disproved the model of a single black
hole system with accretion disk oscillations, as well as several toy models of
binaries without relativistic precession. In the latter models the main
outburst would have been a year later. (2) The nature of the radiation of the
2005 October outburst was expected to be bremsstrahlung from hot gas at the
temperature of $3\times 10^{5}$ $^{\circ}$K. This was confirmed by combined
ground based and ultraviolet observations using the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope.
(3) A secondary outburst of the same nature was expected at 2007 September 13.
Within the accuracy of observations (about 6 hours), it started at the correct
time. Thus the prediction was accurate at the same level as the prediction of
the return of Halley's comet in 1986. (4) Further synchrotron outbursts were
expected following the two bremsstrahlung outbursts. They came as scheduled
between 2007 October and 2009 December. (5) Due to the effect of the secondary
on the overall direction of the jet, the parsec scale jet was expected to
rotate in the sky by a large angle around and after 2009. This rotation may
have been seen at high frequency radio observations. OJ 287 binary black hole
system is currently our best laboratory for testing theories of gravitation.

completeness and reliability. There are now a large number of commonly used

being used for images acquired using different technologies. Despite this,
there have been relatively few quantitative analyses of the robustness or
reliability of individual tools, or the details of the techniques they
implement. We have an opportunity to redress this omission in the context of
surveys planned with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP).
The Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey with ASKAP, a continuum
survey of the Southern Hemisphere up to declination +30 deg, aims to utilise an
automated source identification and measurement approach that is demonstrably
optimal, to maximise the reliability, utility and robustness of the resulting
radio source catalogues. A key stage in source extraction methods is the
background estimation (background level and noise level) and the choice of a
threshold high enough to reject false sources yet not so high that the
catalogues are significantly incomplete. In this analysis we present results
from testing such algorithms as implemented in the SExtractor, Selavy
(Duchamp), and sfind tools on simulated data. In particular the effects of
background estimation, threshold and false-discovery rate settings are
explored. For parameters that give similar completeness, the false-discovery
rate method employed by sfind results in a more reliable catalogue compared to

  final version, accepted in Phys. Lett. B",,,,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  The recent discovery of nonzero $\theta_{13}$ (equal to Cabbibo angle
$\theta_C$ up to a factor of $\sqrt{2}$), the masses of supersymmetric
particles $\gapp$ TeV from LHC data, and the sum of three active neutrino
masses $\sum_i m_{\nu_i}\lapp 1$ eV from the study of large scale structure of
the universe motivate to study whether quark and lepton mixing have the same
origin at the grand unification scale. We find that both results from neutrino
experiments and LHC are complementary in quark-lepton unified model. A new
constraint on SUSY parameters appears from electroweak symmetry breaking with a
new correlation between the lower bounds on sparticle masses and the upper
bound on $\sum_i m_{\nu_i}$. In addition, we find that only $\mu>0$ (which is
favored by $(g-2)$ of muon) is allowed and $m_{\tilde q, \tilde \l} \gapp$ TeV
if $\sum_i m_{\nu_i} \lapp 1$ eV. On the other hand, a small change in lower
limit on $\theta_{13}$ from zero leads to a large increase in lower limits on
sparticles masses ($\gapp 2$ TeV), which are also the bounds if recently
discovered boson at LHC with mass around 125 GeV is the Higgs boson.

Maximum Weighted Matching (MWM) is a throughput-optimal server assignment

with i.i.d. Bernoulli packet arrivals and connectivities, MWM minimizes, in
stochastic ordering sense, a broad range of cost functions of the queue lengths
such as total queue occupancy (which implies minimization of average queueing
delays). Then, we extend the model by considering imperfect services where it
is assumed that the service of a scheduled packet fails randomly with a certain

from a new angle. By invoking the Cauchy problem of relativity it is shown how,
under very precise astrophysical conditions, the Einstein general theory of
relativity is formally equivalent to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of
superconductivity. This fact lead us to suspect that the superconductivity of
gravitation ought to be a real physical process occurring in the outskirts of
galaxies. It is found that quantum mechanically gravity can achieve a type-II
superconductor state characterised by the Gizburg-Landau parameter
$\kappa=1.5$, and it is suggested that a probability flux of Cooper pairs
(quantum gravitational geons charged with vacuum energy) are directly
responsible for the flatness exhibited by the rotation curves in spiral
galaxies, as well as the exotic behaviour observed in galactic cluster
collisions. If this hypothesis proves correct, the whole phenomenon of dark
matter may count, after all, as another triumph for Einstein's theory of
gravity. The tension between gravitation and quantum mechanics is explored
further by a subtle consideration of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory of the
York-time action, providing additional motivation for the above line of
reasoning. In particular, Penrose's estimate for the rate of collapse of the
wavefunction is recovered, and connected to the instability of Misner space.

superconductivity manifests itself in their response to external magnetic
fields. An applied field easily extinguishes s-wave singlet superconductivity
by both the paramagnetic or orbital pair-breaking effects. However, it hardly
destroys triplet state because the paramagnetic effect, owing to spins of the
Cooper pairs readily aligned with the field, is not so efficacious. This
suggests that the triplet superconductivity may be affected mostly by the
orbital effect. Conversely, if one can break down the orbital effect then one
can recover the superconductivity. Here, we show that superconductivity can be
induced with magnetic fields applied parallel to the ab plane of crystals of
the magnetic Eu(Fe0.81Co0.19)2As2 superconductor. We argue that the tuning

The system-bath coupling is taken into account as a modulating factor of the

2/1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). Inside the resonant domain, there exist two
families of periodic orbits, one associated to the librational motion of the
critical angle ($\sigma$-family) and the other related to the circulatory
motion of the angle between the pericentres ($\Delta\varpi$-family). The
well-known apsidal corotation resonances (ACR) appear at the intersections of
these families. A complex web of secondary resonances exists also for low
eccentricities, whose strengths and positions are dependent on the individual
masses and spatial scale of the system.
  Depending on initial conditions, a resonant system is found in one of the two
topologically different states, referred to as \textit{internal} and
\textit{external} resonances. The internal resonance is characterized by
symmetric ACR and its resonant angle is $2\,\lambda_2-\lambda_1-\varpi_1$,
where $\lambda_i$ and $\varpi_i$ stand for the planetary mean longitudes and
longitudes of pericentre, respectively. In contrast, the external resonance is
characterized by asymmetric ACR and the resonant angle is
$2\,\lambda_2-\lambda_1-\varpi_2$. We show that systems with more massive outer
planets always envolve inside internal resonances. The limit case is the
well-known asteroidal resonances with Jupiter. At variance, systems with more
massive inner planets may evolve in either internal or external resonances; the
internal resonances are typical for low-to-moderate eccentricity
configurations, whereas the external ones for high eccentricity configurations
of the systems. In the limit case, analogous to Kuiper belt objects in
resonances with Neptune, the systems are always in the external resonances
characterized by asymmetric equilibria.

communication networks. The cost of effectively and accurately computing
pairwise network distances can become prohibitive in large-scale networks such
as the Internet and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. To negotiate the rising need
for very efficient distance computation, approximation techniques for numerous
variants of this question have recently received significant attention in the
literature. The goal is to preprocess the graph and store a small amount of
information such that whenever a query for any pairwise distance is issued, the
distance can be well approximated (i.e., with small stretch) very quickly in an
online fashion. Specifically, the pre-processing (usually) involves storing a
small sketch with each node, such that at query time only the sketches of the
concerned nodes need to be looked up to compute the approximate distance. In
this paper, we present the first theoretical study of distance sketches derived
from distance oracles in a distributed network. We first present a fast
distributed algorithm for computing approximate distance sketches, based on a
distributed implementation of the distance oracle scheme of [Thorup-Zwick, JACM
2005]. We also show how to modify this basic construction to achieve different
tradeoffs between the number of pairs for which the distance estimate is
accurate and other parameters. These tradeoffs can then be combined to give an
efficient construction of small sketches with provable average-case as well as
worst-case performance. Our algorithms use only small-sized messages and hence
are suitable for bandwidth-constrained networks, and can be used in various
networking applications such as topology discovery and construction, token
management, load balancing, monitoring overlays, and several other problems in
distributed algorithms.

construct digraph realizations \cite{KleitWang:73}. The second one draws back
into the Fifties and Sixties of the last century and gives a complete
characterization of digraph sequences (Gale 1957, Fulkerson 1960, Ryser 1957,
Chen 1966). That is, one has only to validate a certain number of inequalities.
Chen bounded this number by $n$. His characterization demands the property that
$S$ has to be in lexicographical order. We show that this condition is stronger
than necessary. We provide a new characterization which is formally analogous
to the classical one by Erd{\H o}s and Gallai (1960) for graphs. Hence, we can
give several, different sets of $n$ inequalities. We think that this stronger
result can be very important with respect to structural insights about the sets
of digraph sequences, for example in the context of threshold sequences.
Furthermore, the number of inequalities can be restricted to all $k \in
\{1,\dots,n-1\}$ with $a_{k+1}>a_{k}$ and to $k=n.$ An analogous result for
graphs was given by Tripathi and Vijay \cite{TripathiVijay03}. We prove this
property also for the case of digraphs (no parallel arcs) with at most one loop
per vertex.

insufficient signal-to-noise ratio, without strong emission lines, and without
the [OII] lambda3727 {\AA} line, which is necessary for the determination of
the gas metallicity. This excludes galaxies with redshift <~ 0.033. Our final
sample contains ~700 spectra of HII galaxies. Through emission line strength
calibrations and a detailed stellar population analysis employing evolutionary
stellar synthesis methods, which we already used in previous works, we
determined the metallicities of both the gas and the stellar content of these
galaxies. We find that in HII galaxies up to stellar masses of 5\cdot10^9
M_sol, enrichment mechanisms do not vary with galactic mass, being the same for
low- and high-mass galaxies on average. They do seem to present a greater
variety at the high-mass end, though, indicating a more complex assembly
history for high-mass galaxies. In around 23 per cent of our HII galaxies we
find a metallicity decrease over the last few Gyr. Our results favour galaxy
evolution models featuring constantly infalling low-metallicity clouds that
retain part of the galactic winds. Above 5\cdot10^9 M_sol stellar mass, the
retention of high metallicity gas by the galaxies' gravitational potential
dominates.

tasked with assigning at each time interval (or slot) K resources (or servers)
to K out of M>=K nodes. When assigned a server, a node can execute a task. The
tasks are independently generated at each node by stochastically symmetric and
memoryless random processes and stored in a finite-capacity task queue.
Moreover, they are time-sensitive in the sense that within each slot there is a
non-zero probability that a task expires before being scheduled. The scheduling
problem is tackled with the aim of maximizing the number of tasks completed
over time (or the task-throughput) under the assumption that the CC has no
direct access to the state of the task queues. The scheduling decisions at the
CC are based on the outcomes of previous scheduling commands, and on the known
statistical properties of the task generation and expiration processes. Based
on a Markovian modeling of the task generation and expiration processes, the CC
scheduling problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be cast into the framework of restless multi-armed
bandit (RMAB) problems. When the task queues are of capacity one, the
optimality of a myopic (or greedy) policy is proved. It is also demonstrated
that the MP coincides with the Whittle index policy. For task queues of
arbitrary capacity instead, the myopic policy is generally suboptimal, and its
performance is compared with an upper bound obtained through a relaxation of
the original problem. Overall, the settings in this paper provide a rare
example where a RMAB problem can be explicitly solved, and in which the Whittle
index policy is proved to be optimal.

(generalized) topological zeta function and the monodromy eigenvalues
associated with a complex analytic function germ f defined on a normal surface
singularity (X,0). The article targets the `right' extension in the case when
the link of (X,0) is a homology sphere. As a first step, we prove a splice
decomposition formula for the topological zeta function Z(f,w;s) for any f and
analytic differential form w, which will play the key technical localization
tool in the later definitions and proofs.
  Then, we define a set of `allowed' differential forms via a local restriction
along each splice component. For plane curves we show the following three
guiding properties: (1) if s' is any pole of Z(f,w;s) with w allowed, then
exp(2\pi is') is a monodromy eigenvalue of f; (2) the `standard' form is
allowed; (3) every monodromy eigenvalue of f is obtained as in (1) for some
allowed w and some s'.

additional (necessary) assumption, which generalizes the semigroup condition of

the components and their intersections using a spectral sequence generalizing
the Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence.
  We describe the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence and give details on how to
compute with it. This allows us to merge local homological data into the global
persistent homology. Furthermore, we detail how the classical topology
constructions inherent in the spectral sequence adapt to a persistence
perspective, as well as describe the techniques from computational commutative
algebra necessary for this extension.
  The resulting computational scheme suggests a parallelization scheme, and we
discuss the communication steps involved in this scheme. Furthermore, the

the composition of the emerging species. Here, the effluent of a He/O2
microplasma jet has been analyzed in a helium and in an air atmosphere by
molecular beam mass spectrometry. First, the composition of the effluent in air
has been recorded as a function of the distance to determine how fast air
admixes into the effluent. Then, the spatial distribution of atomic oxygen and
ozone in the effluent has been recorded in ambient air and compared to
measurements in a helium atmosphere. Additionally, a fluid model of the gas
flow with reaction kinetics of reactive oxygen species in the effluent has been
constructed. In ambient air, the O density declines only slightly faster with
the distance compared to a helium atmosphere. On the contrary, the O3 density
in ambient air increases significantly faster with the distance compared to a
helium atmosphere. This mysterious behavior can have big implication for the
use of similar jets in plasma medicine. It is shown that photodissociation of
O2 and O3 is not responsible for the observed effect. A reaction scheme
involving the reaction of plasma produced highly vibrationally excited O2 with
ground state O2 molecules is proposed as a possible explanation of the observed
densities. A very good agreement between measured and simulated densities is

magnetic response for low temperatures. The theory accounts for the
reorientation of the susceptibility maxima from the axial to the diagonal
direction occurring at small hole concentrations in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. A
small cusp of the hole dispersion near the Fermi level, which is connected with
the spin-polaron band, affords the growth of the maxima with decreasing
frequency. As in the superconducting phase, the susceptibility maxima have an
hourglass dispersion. The assumption of the phase separation into regions of
superconducting and pseudogap phases in underdoped cuprates explains the lack
of the superconducting gap in their susceptibility. The observed rapid change
of widths of the susceptibility maxima with frequency is related to the
contribution of the pseudogap phase. This contribution may also explain the
strengthening of the quasi-elastic response by modest magnetic fields and by
small impurity concentrations.

(dual to the YM coupling) and a tachyon (dual to the chiral condensate), and
are parametrized by the real parameter x, which can take values within the
range 0 <= x < 11/2. We analyze the saddle point solutions, and draw the phase
diagram at zero temperature and density. The backreaction of flavor on the glue
is fully included. We find the conformal window for x >= x_c, and the QCD-like
phase with chiral symmetry breaking at x < x_c, where the critical value x_c
lies close to four. We also find Miransky scaling as x -> x_c as well as
Efimov-like saddle points. By calculating the holographic beta-functions, we
demonstrate the ""walking"" behavior of the coupling in the region near and below
x_c.

proportional to the square root of the corresponding source temperatures, which
leads to the CA formula for a bi-thermal motor. On the other hand, when power

of a bi-thermal motor admits the CA efficiency as a lower bound, which is
attained if the duration of the adiabatic transitions can be neglected.

to integrate the osculating motion (using cartesian coordinates) in a Newtonian
approach of an object considered as a point-mass orbiting a homogeneous central
body that rotates with a constant rate around its axis of smallest inertia. The
code can be applied to objects such as particles, artificial or natural
satellites or space debris. The central body can be either any terrestrial
planet of the solar system, any dwarf-planet, or even an asteroid. In addition,
very many perturbations can be taken into account, such as the combined
third-body attraction of the Sun, the Moon, or the planets, the direct solar
radiation pressure (with the central body shadow), the non-homogeneous
gravitational field caused by the non-sphericity of the central body, and even
some thrust forces. The simulations were performed using different integration
algorithms. Two additional tools were integrated in the software package; the
indicator of chaos MEGNO and the frequency analysis NAFF. NIMASTEP is designed
in a flexible modular style and allows one to (de)select very many options
without compromising the performance. It also allows one to easily add other
possibilities of use. The code has been validated through several tests such as
comparisons with numerical integrations made with other softwares or with
semi-analytical and analytical studies. The various possibilities of NIMASTEP
are described and explained and some tests of astrophysical interest are
presented. At present, the code is proprietary but it will be released for use

on binary evolution, as well as of the physical processes involved in the
formation and evolution of neutron stars and their magnetic fields, and could
turn into binary MSPs with different scales of orbital periods; this effect can
be explained by the AIC process. This scenario also suggests that some fraction
of isolated MSPs in the Galactic disk could be formed through the same channel,
formingthe contribution of some CVs to the single-degenerate progenitors of

whether $v$ is persuaded into buying the new product. Suppose we are given a
target set $S\subseteq V(G)$. Initially, all vertices in $G$ are inactive. At

optimizing the set of links that can be concurrently activated to meet given

assume multiuser decoding receivers, which can cancel strongly interfering
signals. As a result, in contrast to classical spatial reuse, links being close
to each other are more likely to be active simultaneously. Our goal here is to
deliver a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study on optimal link
activation under this novel setup, in order to provide insight into the gains
from adopting interference cancellation. We therefore consider the optimal
problem setting of successive interference cancellation (SIC), as well as the
simpler, yet instructive, case of parallel interference cancellation (PIC). We
prove that both problems are NP-hard and develop compact integer linear
programming formulations that enable us to approach the global optimum

that for low to medium SINR thresholds the improvement is quite substantial,
especially with SIC, whereas for high SINR thresholds the improvement
diminishes and both schemes perform equally well.

time-dependent problem turns out to be globally well posed in the subcritical
regime, and locally well posed in the supercritical and critical regime in the
appropriate energy space. The set of the (nonlinear) ground states is
completely determined. For any value of the nonlinearity power, it exhibits a
symmetry breaking bifurcation structure as a function of the frequency (i.e.,
the nonlinear eigenvalue) $\omega$. More precisely, there exists a critical
value $\om^*$ of the nonlinear eigenvalue $\om$, such that: if $\om_0 < \om <
\om^*$, then there is a single ground state and it is an odd function; if $\om
> \om^*$ then there exist two non-symmetric ground states. We prove that before
bifurcation (i.e., for $\om < \om^*$) and for any subcritical power, every
ground state is orbitally stable. After bifurcation ($\om =\om^*+0$), ground
states are stable if $\mu$ does not exceed a value $\mu^\star$ that lies
between 2 and 2.5, and become unstable for $\mu > \mu^*$. Finally, for $\mu >
2$ and $\om \gg \om^*$, all ground states are unstable. The branch of odd
ground states for $\om < \om^*$ can be continued at any $\om > \om^*$,
obtaining a family of orbitally unstable stationary states. Existence of ground
states is proved by variational techniques, and the stability properties of
stationary states are investigated by means of the Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss

that the initially confined magnetic fields we consider open into the
convective envelope. Angular momentum is transported across the two zones by
magnetic torques and stresses, establishing the so-called Ferarro's law of
isorotation. In the parameter space studied, the confinement of the magnetic
field by meridional circulation penetration fails, also implying the failure of
the tachocline confinement by the magnetic field. Three-dimensional convective

internal dynamo. While the Sun has been the subject of intense research for
refining dynamo models, observations of magnetic cyclic activity in solar type
stars have become more and more available, opening a new path to understand the
underlying physics behind stellar cycles. For instance, it is key to understand
how stellar rotation rate influences magnetic cycle period $\Pcyc$. Recent
numerical simulations of advection-dominated Babcock Leighton models have
demonstrated that it is difficult to explain this observed trend given a) the
strong influence of the cycle period to the meridional circulation amplitude
and b) the fact that 3D models indicate that meridional flows become weaker as
the rotation rate increases. In this paper, we introduce the turbulent pumping
mechanism as another advective process capable also of transporting the
magnetic fields. We found that this model is now able to reproduce the
observations under the assumption that this effect increases as $\Omega^2$. The
turbulent pumping becomes indeed another major player able to circumvent the
meridional circulation. However, for high rotation rates ($\Omega \simeq 5
\Omega_\odot$), its effects dominate those of the meridional circulation,
entering a new class of regime dominated by the advection of turbulent pumping
and thus leading to a cyclic activity qualitatively different from that of the
sun.

servers to a set of $N$ parallel queues in a time slotted queueing system. The
connectivity of each queue to each server is randomly changing with time; each
server can serve at most one queue and each queue can be served by at most one
server per time slot. Such queueing systems were widely applied in modeling the
scheduling (or resource allocation) problem in wireless networks. It has been
previously proven that Maximum Weighted Matching (MWM) is a throughput optimal
server assignment policy for such queueing systems. In this paper, we prove
that for a symmetric system with i.i.d. Bernoulli packet arrivals and
connectivities, MWM minimizes, in stochastic ordering sense, a broad range of
cost functions of the queue lengths including total queue occupancy (or
equivalently average queueing delay).

distribution $\mu_t$ of the random solution at time $t\in\R$. The initial
measure $\mu_0$ has zero mean, a translation-invariant covariance, and a finite
mean charge density. We also assume that $\mu_0$ satisfies a mixing condition
of Rosenblatt- or Ibragimov-Linnik-type. The main result is the long time
convergence of projection of $\mu_t$ onto the continuous spectral space. The
limiting measure is Gaussian.
