which aspire to increase client's transactions and thus profits, offer
searching tools which allow users to (i) post keyword queries to capture their
information needs or (ii) invoke form-based interfaces to create queries by
selecting search options, such as a price range, filled-in entries, check
boxes, or drop-down menus. These search mechanisms, however, are inadequate,
since they cannot be used to specify a natural-language query with rich
syntactic and semantic content, which can only be handled by a question
answering (QA) system. Furthermore, existing ads websites are incapable of
evaluating arbitrary Boolean queries or retrieving partiallymatched answers
that might be of interest to the user whenever a user's search yields only a
few or no results at all. In solving these problems, we present a QA system for
ads, called CQAds, which (i) allows users to post a natural-language question Q
for retrieving relevant ads, if they exist, (ii) identifies ads as answers that
partially-match the requested information expressed in Q, if insufficient or no
answers to Q can be retrieved, which are ordered using a similarity-ranking
approach, and (iii) analyzes incomplete or ambiguous questions to perform the
""best guess"" in retrieving answers that ""best match"" the selection criteria
specified in Q. CQAds is also equipped with a Boolean model to evaluate Boolean
operators that are either explicitly or implicitly specified in Q, i.e., with
or without Boolean operators specified by the users, respectively. CQAds is
easy to use, scalable to all ads domains, and more powerful than search tools
provided by existing ads websites, since its query-processing strategy
retrieves relevant ads of higher quality and quantity. We have verified the
accuracy of CQAds in retrieving ads on eight ads domains and compared

instantaneous coordination of the particles as well as contact force statistics

whose length is of order the square root of the number of faces. We consider a
sequence $(\sigma_n)$ of integers such that $\sigma_n/\sqrt{2n}$ tends to some
$\sigma\in[0,\infty]$. For every $n \ge 1$, we call $q_n$ a random map
uniformly distributed over the set of all rooted planar quadrangulations with a

$\sigma\in (0,\infty)$, we view $q_n$ as a metric space by endowing its set of
vertices with the graph metric, rescaled by $n^{-1/4}$. We show that this
metric space converges in distribution, at least along some subsequence, toward
a limiting random metric space, in the sense of the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
We show that the limiting metric space is almost surely a space of Hausdorff
dimension 4 with a boundary of Hausdorff dimension 2 that is homeomorphic to
the two-dimensional disc. For $\sigma=0$, the same convergence holds without
extraction and the limit is the so-called Brownian map. For $\sigma=\infty$,
the proper scaling becomes $\sigma_n^{-1/2}$ and we obtain a convergence toward
Aldous's CRT.

also brings a row of additional questions. According to observations the
internal space should be static or nearly static at least from the time of
primordial nucleosynthesis, otherwise the fundamental physical constants would
vary. This means that at the present evolutionary stage of the Universe there
are two possibilities: slow variation or compactification of internal space
scale parameters. In many recent studies the problem of extra dimensions
stabilization was studied for so-called ADD. Under these approaches a massive
scalar fields (gravitons or radions) of external space-time can be presented as

multidimensional action to be linear with respect to curvature. Although as
follows from string theory, the gravity action needs to be extended to
nonlinear one. In order to investigate effects of nonlinearity, in this Thesis
a multidimensional Lagrangian will be studied, having the form L = f(R), where
f(R) is an arbitrary smooth function of the scalar curvature.

high-activity bursty intervals alternating with long low-activity periods. In
recent studies such bursty behavior has been characterized by a fat-tailed
inter-event time distribution, while temporal correlations were measured by the
autocorrelation function. However, these characteristic functions are not
capable to fully characterize temporally correlated heterogenous behavior. Here
we show that the distribution of the number of events in a bursty period serves
as a good indicator of the dependencies, leading to the universal observation
of power-law distribution in a broad class of phenomena. We find that the
correlations in these quite different systems can be commonly interpreted by
memory effects and described by a simple phenomenological model, which displays
temporal behavior qualitatively similar to that in real systems.

Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAFs) on an infinite, anisotropic, triangular
lattice when the spin quantum number $s=1$ or $s=3/2$. With respect to a
square-lattice geometry the model has antiferromagnetic ($J_{1} > 0$) bonds
between nearest neighbours and competing ($J_{2}' > 0$) bonds between
next-nearest neighbours across only one of the diagonals of each square
plaquette, the same one in each square. In a topologically equivalent
triangular-lattice geometry, we have two types of nearest-neighbour bonds:
namely the $J_{2}' \equiv \kappa J_{1}$ bonds along parallel chains and the
$J_{1}$ bonds producing an interchain coupling. The model thus interpolates
between an isotropic HAF on the square lattice at $\kappa = 0$ and a set of
decoupled chains at $\kappa \rightarrow \infty$, with the isotropic HAF on the
triangular lattice in between at $\kappa = 1$. For both the $s=1$ and the
$s=3/2$ models we find a second-order quantum phase transition at
$\kappa_{c}=0.615 \pm 0.010$ and $\kappa_{c}=0.575 \pm 0.005$ respectively,
between a N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic state and a helical state. In both cases
the ground-state energy $E$ and its first derivative $dE/d\kappa$ are
continuous at $\kappa=\kappa_{c}$, while the order parameter for the transition
(viz., the average on-site magnetization) does not go to zero on either side of
the transition. The transition at $\kappa = \kappa_{c}$ for both the $s=1$ and
$s=3/2$ cases is analogous to that observed in our previous work for the
$s=1/2$ case at a value $\kappa_{c}=0.80 \pm 0.01$. However, for the higher
spin values the transition is of continuous (second-order) type, as in the
classical case, whereas for the $s=1/2$ case it appears to be weakly
first-order in nature (although a second-order transition could not be
excluded).

Laplacian lattice of a multigraph under the distance function induced by a
regular simplex, namely Voronoi Diagram, Delaunay Triangulation, Delaunay
Polytope and its combinatorial structure, Shortest Vectors, Covering and
Packing Radius. We use this information to obtain the following results: i.
Every multigraph defines a Delaunay triangulation of its Laplacian lattice and
this Delaunay triangulation contains complete information of the multigraph up
to isomorphism. ii. The number of multigraphs with a given Laplacian lattice is
controlled, in particular upper bounded, by the number of different Delaunay
triangulations. iii. We obtain formulas for the covering and packing densities
of a Laplacian lattice and deduce that in the space of Laplacian lattices of
undirected connected multigraphs, the Laplacian lattices of highly connected
multigraphs such as Ramanujan multigraphs possess good covering and packing
properties.

challenges related to the size of the physical platform, photon efficiency, the

This paper describes a coded aperture and keyed exposure approach to
compressive measurement in optical systems. The proposed projections satisfy
the Restricted Isometry Property for sufficiently sparse scenes, and hence are
compatible with theoretical guarantees on the video reconstruction quality.
These concepts can be implemented in both space and time via either amplitude
modulation or phase shifting, and this paper describes the relative merits of
the two approaches in terms of theoretical performance, noise and hardware
considerations, and experimental results. Fast numerical algorithms which
account for the nonnegativity of the projections and temporal correlations in a
video sequence are developed and applied to microscopy and short-wave infrared
data.

system under the assumption that the decalibration consists in unknown gains on
each measure. We focus on {\em blind} calibration, using measures performed on
a few unknown (but sparse) signals. A naive formulation of this blind
calibration problem, using $\ell_{1}$ minimization, is reminiscent of blind
source separation and dictionary learning, which are known to be highly
non-convex and riddled with local minima. In the considered context, we show
that in fact this formulation can be exactly expressed as a convex optimization
problem, and can be solved using off-the-shelf algorithms. Numerical
simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach even for highly
uncalibrated measures, when a sufficient number of (unknown, but sparse)
calibrating signals is provided. We observe that the success/failure of the
approach seems to obey sharp phase transitions.

more massive than $5\times10^{11}\M_{\odot}$, reflecting a higher rotational

Supernova 1987 (SN 1987) velocity bound on electron antineutrinos and the
Cohen-Glashow constraint on superluminal neutrino propagation. The latter can
be circumvented if - within the framework of the model - a sterile neutrino
mixing with the active neutrino mass eigenstates is introduced. The suggestion
of a sterile neutrino accounting for superluminal neutrinos has already been
proposed in several papers. It is possible to choose mixing angles with the
sterile neutrino sector such that the model respects both the SN 1987 bound and
the muon neutrino travels superluminally.

(ii) universal behavior when the coupling crosses a critical point. Our
emphasis is on situations where a subset of bulk fields can be treated in a
probe approximation. We consider two different setups. In the first, defect
conformal field theories are described by probe branes in AdS space-times, and
an initial vacuum state evolves due to a time dependent coupling in the probe
sector. While a black hole formation is invisible in this approximation, we
show that thermalization can nevertheless happen - this is signalled by
formation of apparent horizons on the brane worldvolume. In the second setup,
we consider a probe bulk scalar field in the background of a AdS black brane.
In equilibrium, this system undergoes a critical phase transition at some
temperature when the source for the dual operator vanishes. For a time
dependent source which goes across this critical point, we show that a zero
mode of the bulk field dominates the dynamics and leads to scaling behavior of
the order parameter as a function of the rate of change.

  improvements to the exposition",,,,"cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Until recently, LP relaxations have played a limited role in the design of
approximation algorithms for the Steiner tree problem. In 2010, Byrka et al.
presented a ln(4)+epsilon approximation based on a hypergraphic LP relaxation,
but surprisingly, their analysis does not provide a matching bound on the
integrality gap.
  We take a fresh look at hypergraphic LP relaxations for the Steiner tree
problem - one that heavily exploits methods and results from the theory of
matroids and submodular functions - which leads to stronger integrality gaps,
faster algorithms, and a variety of structural insights of independent
interest. More precisely, we present a deterministic ln(4)+epsilon
approximation that compares against the LP value and therefore proves a
matching ln(4) upper bound on the integrality gap.
  Similarly to Byrka et al., we iteratively fix one component and update the LP
solution. However, whereas they solve an LP at every iteration after
contracting a component, we show how feasibility can be maintained by a greedy
procedure on a well-chosen matroid. Apart from avoiding the expensive step of
solving a hypergraphic LP at each iteration, our algorithm can be analyzed
using a simple potential function. This gives an easy means to determine
stronger approximation guarantees and integrality gaps when considering
restricted graph topologies. In particular, this readily leads to a 73/60 bound
on the integrality gap for quasi-bipartite graphs.
  For the case of quasi-bipartite graphs, we present a simple algorithm to
transform an optimal solution to the bidirected cut relaxation to an optimal
solution of the hypergraphic relaxation, leading to a fast 73/60 approximation
for quasi-bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we show how the separation problem of
the hypergraphic relaxation can be solved by computing maximum flows, providing
a fast independence oracle for our matroids.

results shows the existence of a low energy space parameter where this model is
able to accommodate the known spectrum of quark masses and mixing in a $4\times
4$ non-unitary $V_{CKM}$ as well as the charged lepton masses. Motivated by the
recent LSND and MiniBooNe short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments we
fit for the 3+1 scenario the neutrino squared mass differences $m_2^2 -
m_1^2\approx 7.6\times 10^{-5}\;\text{eV}^2$, $m_3^2 - m_2^2\approx 2.43\times

predicts the D vector like quark mass in the range $M_D=(350 - 900)GeV$ and
horizontal gauge boson masses of few TeV. These low energy predictions are

formulation. Specifically, we use query feedback from a workload as training
data to estimate a histogram with a small memory footprint that minimizes the
expected error on future queries. Our formulation provides a framework in which
different approaches can be studied and developed. We first study the simple
class of equi-width histograms and present a learning algorithm, EquiHist, that
is competitive in many settings. We also provide formal guarantees for
equi-width histograms that highlight scenarios in which equi-width histograms
can be expected to succeed or fail. We then go beyond equi-width histograms and
present a novel learning algorithm, SpHist, for estimating general histograms.
Here we use Haar wavelets to reduce the problem of learning histograms to that
of learning a sparse vector. Both algorithms have multiple advantages over
existing methods: 1) simple and scalable extensions to multi-dimensional data,
2) scalability with number of histogram buckets and size of query feedback, 3)
natural extensions to incorporate new feedback and handle database updates. We
demonstrate these advantages over the current state-of-the-art, ISOMER, through
detailed experiments on real and synthetic data. In particular, we show that
SpHist obtains up to 50% less error than ISOMER on real-world multi-dimensional
datasets.

usually lie between 1000 and 1000 000 000. This equation, although often
referenced to FN's 1928 paper, is a simplified equation used in undergraduate
teaching, does not apply unmodified to LAFEs, and does not appear in the 1928

recent than 1928, and often do not comment on the discrepancy between theory

American and UK applied-science journals, and in various other places. It does
not inhibit practical LAFE development, but can give a misleading impression of
potential LAFE performance to non-experts. This paper shows how the misleading

three high-level correction factors. One of these, or a combination of two of
them, may be useful as an additional measure of LAFE quality; this paper
describes how to estimate factor values using experimental data. Suggestions
are made for improved engineering practice in reporting LAFE results. Some of

accretion flows (ADAF) in the presence of a pure azimuthal magnetic field is
investigated. The mechanism of energy dissipation is assumed to be the
viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence in the accretion flow.
It is assumed that the magnetic diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity are not
constant and vary by position and $\alpha$-prescription is used for them. In
order to solve the integrated equations that govern the behavior of the
accretion flow, a self-similar method is used. The solutions show that the
structure of accretion flow depends on the magnetic field and the magnetic
diffusivity. As, the radial infall velocity and the temperature of the flow
increase, and the rotational velocity decreases. Also, the rotational velocity
for all selected values of magnetic diffusivity and magnetic field is
sub-Keplerian. The solutions show that there is a certain amount of magnetic
field that the rotational velocity of the flow becomes zero. This amount of the
magnetic field depends on the gas properties of the disc, such as adiabatic
index and viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, and advection parameters. The
solutions show the mass accretion rate increases by adding the magnetic
diffusivity and in high magnetic pressure case, the ratio of the mass accretion
rate to the Bondi accretion rate decreases as magnetic field increases. Also,
the study of Lundquist and magnetic Reynolds numbers based on resistivity
indicates that the linear growth of magnetorotational instability (MRI) of the
flow decreases by resistivity. This property is qualitatively consistent with
resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations.

representations of functions of two variables over discrete domains by
integrals of two-fold products of functions of one variable. An analogous
statement is proved, concerning continuous functions of two variables over
general topological domains. The main result is a construction of a continuous
map $\Phi$ from $l^2(A)$ into $L^2(\Omega_A, P_A)$, where $A$ is a set,
$\Omega_A = {-1,1}^A$, and $P_A$ is the uniform probability measure on
$\Omega_A$, such that $$\sum_{\alpha \in A} x(\alpha) \bar{y}(\alpha)} =
\int_{\Omega_A} \Phi(x)\Phi(\bar{y})dP_A, x \in l^2(A), y \in l^2(A),$$ and $$
|\Phi(x)|_{L^{\infty}} \leq K |x|_2, x \in l^2(A),$$ for an absolute constant
$K > 1$. ($\Phi$ is non-linear, and does not commute with complex conjugation.)
The bilinear Parseval-like formula above is obtained by iterating the usual
Parseval formula in a framework of harmonic analysis on dyadic groups. A
modified construction implies a similar integral representation of the dual
action between $l^p$ and $l^q$, \ $1/p + 1/q= 1$. Parseval-like formulas are
derived in higher dimensions. These variants involve representations of
functions of $n$ variables in terms of functions of $k$ variables, $0 < k < n$.
Multilinear extensions of the Grothendieck inequality are obtained, and are
used to characterize the feasibility of integral representations of multilinear
functionals on a Hilbert space.

temperature sustainability of the FBGs written into these fibers was
investigated and seen to be quite significant at temperatures as high as 850
^{\circ}C, in particular for the Sn/Er and Sb/Er fibers. A fiber laser using
the Sb/Er fiber as the gain medium was demonstrated, giving evidence of the
strong fluorescence emission from the Er dopant. These fibers are all suitable
for use in a variety of sensing applications for the simultaneous measurement
of temperature and strain by means of monitoring both the fluorescence
characteristics and the peak wavelength shift of the FBGs formed in fiber laser
sensor application.

  stabilization by thermal effects in the early universe is related to late
  time moduli stabilization by non-thermal effects",,"10.1007/JHEP11(2012)079","CPHT-RR098.1111","hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the type II superstring compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds at
finite temperature. The latter is implemented at the string level by a free
action on the Euclidean time circle. We show that all Kahler and complex
structure moduli involved in the gauge theories geometrically engineered in the
vicinity of singular loci are lifted by the stringy thermal effective
potential. The analysis is based on the effective gauged supergravity at low
energy, without integrating out the BPS states becoming massless at the
singular loci. The universal form of the action in the weak coupling regime at
low enough temperature is determined in two cases. Namely the conifold locus,
as well as a locus where the internal space develops a genus-g curve of A{N-1}
singularities, realizing an SU(N) gauge theory coupled to g hypermultiplets in
the adjoint. In general, the favored points of stabilization sit at the
intersection of several singular loci. Thus the entire vector multiplet moduli
space can be lifted, together with hypermultiplet moduli. The scalars are
dynamically stabilized during the cosmological evolution induced by the
back-reaction of the thermal effective potential. When the universe expands and
the temperature T drops, the scalars converge to minima, with damped
oscillations. Moreover, they store an energy density that scales as T^4, which
never dominates over radiation. The reason for this is that the mass they
acquire at one-loop is of order the temperature scale, which is time-dependent.
As an example we analyze the type IIA compactification on a Calabi-Yau space
with Hodge numbers h{11}=2 and h{12}=128. In this case, both Kahler moduli are
stabilized, where the internal space develops a node and an enhanced SU(2)
gauge theory coupled to 2 adjoint hypermultiplets. This shows that in the dual
thermal heterotic picture on K3xT^2, the torus modulus and the axio-dilaton are
stabilized.

require that the source sample's selection is not biased by CMB fluctuations.
We compare profiles from sources in the standard WMAP catalog, the WMAP catalog
selected from a CMB-free combination of data, and the NVSS catalog, and
quantify the agreement with fits to simple parametric beam models. We estimate
the biases in source profiles due to alignments with positive CMB fluctuations,
finding them roughly consistent with those biases found with the WMAP standard
catalog. Addressing those biases, we find source spectral indices significantly
steeper than those used by WMAP, with strong evidence for spectral steepening
above 61 GHz. Such changes modify the power spectrum correction required for
unresolved point sources, and tend to weaken somewhat the evidence for
deviation from a Harrison-Zel'dovich primordial spectrum, but more analysis is
required. Finally, we discuss implications for current CMB experiments.

gravitino mass is about several GeV. The strong constraints on supersymmetry
viable parameter space from the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the LHC can be
relaxed due to the heavy colored supersymmetric particles, and it is consistent
with null results in the dark matter (DM) direct search experiments such as
XENON100. In particular, the possible maximal flavor and CP violations from the
relatively small gravity mediation may naturally account for the recent LHCb
anomaly. In addition, because the gravitino mass is around the asymmetric DM
mass, we propose the asymmetric origin of the gravitino relic density and solve
the cosmological coincident problem on the DM and baryon densities \Omega_{\rm
DM}:\Omega_{B}\approx 5:1. The gravitino relic density arises from asymmetric
metastable particle (AMP) late decay. However, we show that there is no AMP
candidate in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (SM) due to the robust
gaugino/Higgsino mediated wash-out effects. Interestingly, AMP can be realized
in the well motivated supersymmetric SMs with vector-like particles or
continuous U(1)_R symmetry. Especially, the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass
can be lifted in the supersymmetric SMs with vector-like particles.

binaries using LIGO and Virgo observations between July 7, 2009 and October 20,

solar masses; this includes binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and
binaries consisting of a black hole and neutron star. The detectors were
sensitive to systems up to 40 Mpc distant for binary neutron stars, and further
for higher mass systems. No gravitational-wave signals were detected. We report
upper limits on the rate of compact binary coalescence as a function of total
mass, including the results from previous LIGO and Virgo observations. The
cumulative 90%-confidence rate upper limits of the binary coalescence of binary
neutron star, neutron star- black hole and binary black hole systems are 1.3 x
10^{-4}, 3.1 x 10^{-5} and 6.4 x 10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1}, respectively. These
upper limits are up to a factor 1.4 lower than previously derived limits. We

interpret these results in the context of hydrodynamical models for the

ionization age, and the implied mass coordinates, are highly peaked and suggest
that the ejecta were subjected to multiple secondary shocks following reverse
shock interaction with ejecta inhomogeneities. Based on the fitted emission
measure and element abundances, and an estimate of the emitting volume, we
derive masses for the X-ray emitting ejecta and also show the distribution of
the mass of various elements over the remnant. An upper limit to the total
shocked Fe mass visible in X-rays appears to be roughly 0.13 M_sun, which
accounts for nearly all of the mass expected in Fe ejecta. We find two
populations of Fe ejecta, that associated with normal Si-burning and that
possibly associated with alpha-rich freeze-out, with a mass ratio of
approximately 2:1. Essentially all of the observed Fe (both components) lies
well outside the central regions of the SNR, possibly having been ejected by
hydrodynamic instabilities during the explosion. We discuss this, and its
implications for the neutron star kick.

describing disk-winds but need several improvements. In a previous article, we
introduced models of jets from truncated disks, i.e. evolved in time numerical
simulations based on a radially self-similar MHD solution but including the
effects of a finite radius of the jet-emitting disk and thus the outflow. In
paper I of this series, we compared these models with available observational
data varying the jet density and velocity, the mass of the protostar and the
radius of the aforementioned truncation. In paper I, we assumed that the jet
lies in the plane of the sky. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
different inclinations of the jet. In order to compare our models with observed
jet widths inferred from recent optical images taken with HST and AO, we create
again emission maps in different forbidden lines and from such emission maps,
we determine the jet width as the full-width half-maximum of the emission. We
can reproduce the jet width of DG Tau and its variations very well and the
derived inclination of 40$^\circ$ is in excellent agreement with literature
values of 32--52$^\circ$. In CW Tau we overestimate the inclination in our
best-fit model. In the other objects, we cannot find appropriate models which
reproduce the variations of the observed jet widths, only the average jet width
itself is well modeled as in paper I. We conclude that truncation -- i.e.
taking into account the finite radius of the jet launching region -- is
necessary to reproduce the observed jet widths and our simulations limit the
possible range of truncation radii. The effects of inclination are important
for modeling the intrinsic variations seen in observed jet widths. Our models
can be used to infer independently the inclinations in the observed sample,
however, a parameter study with a finer grid of parameters is needed.

better precision, in general. For 174 of these stars, we obtained multi-epoch
data with sufficient time baselines to identify binaries based on radial
velocity variations. We identified eight close binaries and four close triples,
of which three and two, respectively, are new discoveries. The spectroscopic
multiplicity fractions we find for Cha I (7%) and Tau-Aur (6%) are similar to
each other, and to the results of field star surveys in the same mass and
period regime. However, unlike the results from imaging surveys, the frequency
of systems with close companions in our sample is not seen to depend on primary
mass. Additionally, we do not find a strong correlation between accretion and
close multiplicity. This implies that close companions are not likely the main
source of the accretion shut down observed in weak-lined T Tauri stars. Our
results also suggest that sufficient radial velocity precision can be achieved
for at least a subset of slowly rotating young stars to search for hot Jupiter
planets.

cosmological and astrophysical probes. We can (i) infer the Hubble constant
based on the time-delay technique, (ii) unveil substructures along the l.o.s.
toward distant galaxies, and (iii) compare the shape and the slope of baryons
and dark matter distributions in galaxies. To reach these goals, we need
high-accuracy astrometry and morphology measurements of the lens. In this work,
we first present new astrometry for 11 lenses with measured time delays. Using
MCS deconvolution on NIC2 HST images, we reached an astrometric accuracy of
about 1-2.5 mas and an accurate shape measurement of the lens galaxy. Second,
we combined these measurements with those of 14 other systems to present new
mass models of these lenses. This led to the following results: 1) In 4
double-image quasars, we show that the influence of the lens environment on the
time delay can easily be quantified and modeled, hence putting these lenses
with high priority for time-delay determination. 2) For quadruple-image
quasars, the difficulty often encountered in reproducing the image positions to
milli-arcsec accuracy (astrometric anomaly) is overcome by explicitly including
the nearest visible galaxy in the model. However, one anomalous system
(J1131-1231) does not show any luminous perturber in its vicinity, and three
others (WFI2026-4536, WFI2033-4723, and B2045+265) have problematic modeling.
These 4 systems are the best candidates for a pertubation by a dark matter
substructure. 3) We find a significant correlation between the PA of the light
and of the mass distributions in lensing galaxies. In contrast with other
studies, we find that the ellipticity of the light and of the mass also
correlate well, suggesting that the overall spatial distribution of matter is
not very different from the baryon distribution in the inner \sim 5 kpc of
lensing galaxies.

five halos to z = 0 and find gaseous-disk formation in all; however, in
agreement with previous SPH simulations (that did not include a subgrid
feedback model), the rotation curves of all halos are centrally peaked due to a
massive spheroidal component. Our standard model includes radiative cooling and
star formation, but no feedback. We further investigate this angular momentum
problem by systematically modifying various simulation parameters including:
(i) spatial resolution, ranging from 1700 to 212 pc; (ii) an additional
pressure component to ensure that the Jeans length is always resolved; (iii)
low star formation efficiency, going down to 0.1%; (iv) fixed physical
resolution as opposed to comoving resolution; (v) a supernova feedback model
which injects thermal energy to the local cell; and (vi) a subgrid feedback
model which suppresses cooling in the immediate vicinity of a star formation
event. Of all of these, we find that only the last (cooling suppression) has
any impact on the massive spheroidal component. In particular, a simulation
with cooling suppression and feedback results in a rotation curve that, while
still peaked, is considerably reduced from our standard runs.

Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs), including dark GRBs. It is likely its properties
result from chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), believed to be a key
process for a massive star to become a GRB. It is also heavily obscured by dust
extinction, which could make it a dark GRB upon explosion. Using Spitzer data
we investigate the properties of interstellar dust in the vicinity of R136, and
argue that its high obscuration is not unusual for its environment and that it
could indeed be a slow runaway (""walkaway"") from R136. Unfortunately, based on
its current mass loss rate, VFTS 682 is unlikely to become a GRB, because it
will lose too much angular momentum at its death. If it were to become a GRB,
it probably would also not be dark, either escaping or destroying its
surrounding dusty region. Nevertheless, it is a very interesting star,
deserving further studies, and being one of only three presently identified WR

star develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. After completing an
eccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming an
accretion disk and emitting radiation. The same process may occur on planetary
scales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. In the Solar System,
comets fall directly onto our Sun or onto planets. If the star is a compact
object, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. Indeed, one of the first
mechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion of
comets onto neutron stars in our Galaxy. Here we report that the peculiarities
of the `Christmas' gamma-ray burst (GRB 101225A) can be explained by a tidal
disruption event of a minor body around a Galactic isolated neutron star. This
result would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compact
stellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our Solar System or that
minor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. A
peculiar Supernova associated to a GRB may provide an alternative explanation.

to explore the many-body physics of strongly interacting quantum systems. In
the past decade, experiments have investigated a wealth of intriguing
phenomena, and precise measurements of ground-state properties have provided
exquisite benchmarks for the development of elaborate theoretical descriptions.
Metastable states in Fermi gases with strong repulsive interactions represent
an exciting new frontier in the field. The realization of such systems
constitutes a major challenge since a strong repulsive interaction in an atomic
quantum gas implies the existence of a weakly bound molecular state, which
makes the system intrinsically unstable against decay. Here, we exploit
radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure the complete excitation spectrum of
fermionic 40K impurities resonantly interacting with a Fermi sea of 6Li atoms.
In particular, we show that a well-defined quasiparticle exists for strongly
repulsive interactions. For this ""repulsive polaron"" we measure its energy and
its lifetime against decay. We also probe its coherence properties by measuring
the quasiparticle residue. The results are well described by a theoretical
approach that takes into account the finite effective range of the interaction
in our system. We find that a non-zero range of the order of the interparticle
spacing results in a substantial lifetime increase. This major benefit for the
stability of the repulsive branch opens up new perspectives for investigating
novel phenomena in metastable, repulsively interacting fermion systems.

magnetic turbulence in 3D requires reconnection and 3D magnetic turbulence
entails fast reconnection. We follow the approach in Eyink, Lazarian & Vishniac
2011 to show that the expressions of fast magnetic reconnection in Lazarian &
Vishniac 1999 can be recovered if Richardson diffusion of turbulent flows is
used instead of ordinary Ohmic diffusion. This does not revive, however, the
concept of magnetic turbulent diffusion which assumes that magnetic fields can
be mixed up in a passive way down to a very small dissipation scales. On the
contrary, we are dealing the reconnection of dynamically important magnetic
field bundles which strongly resist bending and have well defined mean
direction weakly perturbed by turbulence. We argue that in the presence of
turbulence the very concept of flux-freezing requires modification. The
diffusion that arises from magnetic turbulence can be called reconnection
diffusion as it based on reconnection of magnetic field lines. The reconnection
diffusion has important implications for the continuous transport processes in
magnetized plasmas and for star formation. In addition, fast magnetic
reconnection in turbulent media induces the First order Fermi acceleration of
energetic particles, can explain solar flares and gamma ray bursts. However,
the most dramatic consequence of these developments is the fact that the
standard flux freezing concept must be radically modified in the presence of

us to measure these higher moments of the gravitational field, however, are

orbiting within the hot, tenuous plasma that surrounds the black hole. The
properties of this plasma at large distances from the central object have been
measured using observations of the extended X-ray emission that surrounds the
point source. At distances comparable to the black-hole event horizon, the
properties of the accretion flow have been constrained using observations of
its long-wavelength emission and polarization, as well as of the size of the
emitting region at 1.3 mm. I use models of the plasma density and temperature

delta Cephei revealed an extended dusty nebula surrounding this star and its
hot companion. The infrared emission resembles a bow shock aligned with the
direction of space motion of the star, indicating that delta Cep is undergoing
mass-loss through a stellar wind. Here we report HI 21-cm line observations
with the VLA to search for neutral atomic hydrogen associated with this wind.
Our VLA data reveal a spatially extended HI nebula (~13' or 1 pc across)
surrounding the position of delta Cep. The nebula has a head-tail morphology,
consistent with circumstellar ejecta shaped by the interaction between a
stellar wind and the ISM. We directly measure a mass of circumstellar hydrogen
M_HI\approx0.07M_odot, although the total HI mass may be larger. The HI data
imply a stellar wind with an outflow velocity V_o=35.6\pm1.2 km/s and a
mass-loss rate of M_dot=(1.0\pm0.8)x10**-6 M_dot/yr. We have computed
theoretical evolutionary tracks that include mass loss across the instability
strip and show that a mass-loss rate of this magnitude, sustained over the
preceding Cepheid lifetime of delta Cep, could be sufficient to resolve a
significant fraction of the discrepancy between the pulsation and evolutionary
masses for this star. (abridged)

of massive galaxies over the 0.4<z<1.8 redshift range and its implications for
our understanding of the physical processes responsible for galaxy evolution.
We use multiwavelength observations included in the GOODS-MUSIC catalogue,
which provides a suitable coverage of the spectral region from 0.3 to 24 micron
and either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts for each object. Individual
SFRs have been obtained by combining UV and 24 micron observations, when the
latter were available. For all other sources an ""SED fitting"" SFR estimate has
been considered. We then define a stellar mass limited sample, complete in the
Mstar>1.e10 Msun range and determine the SFRF using the 1/Vmax algorithm. We
define simulated galaxy catalogues based on three different semi-analytical
models of galaxy formation and evolution. We show that the theoretical SFRFs
are well described by a double power law functional form and its redshift
evolution is approximated with high accuracy by a pure evolution of the typical
SFR. We find good agreement between model predictions and the high-SFR end of
the SFRF, when the observational errors on the SFR are taken into account.
However, the observational SFRF is characterised by a double peaked structure,
which is absent in its theoretical counterparts. At z>1.0 the observed SFRF
shows a relevant density evolution, which is not reproduced by SAMs, due to the
well known overprediction of intermediate mass galaxies at z~2. The agreement
at the low-SFR end is poor: all models overpredict the space density of SFR~1
Msun/yr and no model reproduces the double peaked shape of the observational
SFRF. If confirmed by deeper IR observations, this discrepancy will provide a
key constraint on theoretical modelling of star formation and stellar feedback.

commonly observed properties of social networks, heavy-tailed degree

neighborhoods (also known as egonets) that are themselves good communities. We
evaluate these neighborhood communities on a range of graphs. What we find is
that the neighborhood communities often exhibit conductance scores that are as
good as the Fiedler cut. Also, the conductance of neighborhood communities
shows similar behavior as the network community profile computed with a
personalized PageRank community detection method. The latter requires sweeping
over a great many starting vertices, which can be expensive. By using a small

communities, however, we find communities that precisely capture the behavior
of the network community profile when seeded everywhere in the graph, and at a
significant reduction in total work.

unexplored territory and yet are vital to our understanding of cluster growth,
structure, and mass. In this presentation, we show the first results from a
program to constrain the state of the outer intracluster medium (ICM) in a
large sample of galaxy clusters, exploiting the strengths of three
complementary X-ray observatories: Suzaku (low, stable background), XMM-Newton
(high sensitivity), and Chandra (good spatial resolution). By carefully
combining observations from the cluster core to beyond r_200, we are able to
identify and reduce systematic uncertainties that would impede our spatial and
spectral analysis using a single telescope. Our sample comprises nine clusters
at z ~ 0.1-0.2 fully covered in azimuth to beyond r_200, and our analysis
indicates that the ICM is not in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster
outskirts, where we see clear azimuthal variations in temperature and surface
brightness. In one of the clusters, we are able to measure the diffuse X-ray
emission well beyond r_200, and we find that the entropy profile and the gas
fraction are consistent with expectations from theory and numerical
simulations. These results stand in contrast to recent studies which point to
gas clumping in the outskirts; the extent to which differences of cluster
environment or instrumental effects factor in this difference remains unclear.
From a broader perspective, this project will produce a sizeable fiducial data

formation in solar atmosphere models with different magnetic field
configurations. The presence in the chromosphere of waves with periods longer
than the acoustic cutoff period has been ascribed to either strong inclined
magnetic fields, or changes in the radiative relaxation time. Our simulations
include a sophisticated treatment of radiative losses, as well as fields with
different strengths and inclinations. Using Fourier and wavelet analysis
techniques, we investigate the periodicity of the waves that travel through the
chromosphere. We find that the velocity signal is dominated by waves with
periods around 5 minutes in regions of strong, inclined field, including at the
edges of strong flux tubes where the field expands, whereas 3-minute waves
dominate in regions of weak or vertically oriented fields. Our results show
that the field inclination is very important for long-period wave propagation,
whereas variations in the radiative relaxation time have little effect.
Furthermore, we find that atmospheric conditions can vary significantly on
timescales of a few minutes, meaning that a Fourier analysis of wave
propagation can be misleading. Wavelet techniques take variations with time
into account and are more suitable analysis tools. Finally, we investigate the
properties of jets formed by the propagating waves once they reach the
transition region, and find systematic differences between the jets in inclined
field regions and those in vertical field regions, in agreement with
observations of dynamic fibrils.

this bombardment probably affected all of the inner Solar System. Basin
magnetization signatures and lunar crater size-distributions indicate that the
last episode of bombardment at about 3.85 Gyr ago was less extensive than
previously thought. We explore the contribution of the primordial Mars-crosser
population to early lunar bombardment. We find that Mars-crosser population
initially decays with a 80-Myr half-life, with the long tail of survivors
clustering on temporarily non-Mars-crossing orbits between 1.8 and 2 AU. These
survivors decay with half-life of about 600 Myr and are progenitors of the
extant Hungaria asteroid group in the same region. We estimate the primordial
Mars-crosser population contained about 0.01-0.02 Earth masses. Such initial
population is consistent with no lunar basins forming after 3.8 Gya and the
amount of mass in the Hungaria group. As they survive longer and in greater
numbers than other primordial populations, Mars-crossers are the best candidate
for forming the majority of lunar craters and basins, including most of the
Nectarian system. However, this remnant population cannot produce Imbrium and
Orientale basins, which formed too late and are too large to be part of a
smooth bombardment. We propose that the Imbrian basins and craters formed in a
discrete event, consistent with the basin magnetization signatures and crater
size-distributions. This late ""impactor shower"" would be triggered by a
collisional disruption of a Vesta-sized body from this primordial Mars-crossing
population (Wetherill, 1975) that was still comparable to the present-day
asteroid belt a 3.9 Gya. This tidal disruption lead to a short-lived spike in
bombardment by non-chondritic impactors with a non-asteroidal size-frequency
distribution, in agreement with available evidence. [abridged]

(2^n-1)-dimensional vector obtained by evaluating the joint entropy of all

the region of entropic vectors is an important open problem with many
applications in information theory. Recently, it has been shown that the
entropy regions for discrete and continuous random variables, though different,
can be determined from one another. An important class of continuous random
variables are those that are vector-valued and jointly Gaussian. In this paper
we give a full characterization of the convex cone of the entropy region of
three jointly Gaussian vector-valued random variables and prove that it is the
same as the convex cone of three scalar-valued Gaussian random variables and
further that it yields the entire entropy region of 3 arbitrary random
variables. We further determine the actual entropy region of 3 vector-valued
jointly Gaussian random variables through a conjecture. For n>=4 number of
random variables, we point out a set of 2^n-1-n(n+1)/2 minimal necessary and
sufficient conditions that 2^n-1 numbers must satisfy in order to correspond to
the entropy vector of n scalar jointly Gaussian random variables. This improves
on a result of Holtz and Sturmfels which gave a nonminimal set of conditions.
These constraints are related to Cayley's hyperdeterminant and hence with an
eye towards characterizing the entropy region of jointly Gaussian random
variables, we also present some new results in this area. We obtain a new
(determinant) formula for the 2*2*2 hyperdeterminant and we also give a new

selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The reddening parameterized
by color excess E(B-V) is derived from the Balmer decrement. Besides the
dependency of reddening on Halpha luminosity / surface brightness and gas phase
metallicity, it is also correlated with the galaxy inclination, in the sense
that edge-on galaxies are more attenuated than face-on galaxies at a give
intrinsic luminosity. In light of these correlations, we present the empirical
formulae of E(B-V) as a function of these galaxy properties, with a scatter of
only 0.07 mag. The empirical relation can be reproduced if most dust
attenuation to the HII region is due to diffuse interstellar dust distributing
in a disc thicker than that of HII regions. The empirical formulae can be
incorporated into semi-analytical models of galaxy formation and evolution to
estimate the dust reddening and enable comparison with observations more

software, IRAF depends on Universal Time (UT) in many modules throughout its
codebase. The author was the Y2K lead for IRAF in the late 1990's. A
conservative underestimate of the initial inventory of UTC ""hits"" in IRAF
(e.g., from search terms like ""UT"", ""GMT"" and ""MJD"") contains several times as
many files as the corresponding Y2K (""millennium bug"") inventory did in the

astrophysical problems, e.g., CMB foreground, ionization of molecular clouds

revisions in the paradigm of cosmic ray transport. We use the models of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that were tested in numerical simulation, in
which turbulence is injected at large scale and cascades to to small scales. We
shall address the issue of the transport of CRs, both parallel and
perpendicular to the magnetic field and show that the issue of cosmic ray
subdiffusion is only important for restricted cases when the ambient turbulence
is far from that suggested by numerical simulations. Moreover, on scales less
than injection scale of turbulence, CRs's transport becomes super-diffusive. We
also shall discuss the nonlinear growth of kinetic gyroresonance instability of
cosmic rays induced by large scale compressible turbulence. This gyroresonance
of cosmic rays on turbulence is demonstrated an important scattering mechanism
in addition to direct interaction with the compressible turbulence. The
feedback of the instability on large scale turbulence cannot be neglected, and
should be included in future simulations.

order and large argument is a notoriously problematic issue in physics.
Recurrence relations are inefficient when an individual function of high order
and argument is to be evaluated. The coefficients in the well-known uniform
asymptotic expansions have a complex mathematical structure which involves Airy
functions. For Bessel and Hankel functions, we present an adapted algorithm
which relies on a combination of three methods: (i) numerical evaluation of
Debye polynomials, (ii) calculation of Airy functions with special emphasis on
their Stokes lines, and (iii) resummation of the entire uniform asymptotic
expansion of the Bessel and Hankel functions by nonlinear sequence
transformations.
  In general, for an evaluation of a special function, we advocate the use of
nonlinear sequence transformations in order to bridge the gap between the
asymptotic expansion for large argument and the Taylor expansion for small
argument (""principle of asymptotic overlap""). This general principle needs to
be strongly adapted to the current case, taking into account the complex phase
of the argument. Combining the indicated techniques, we observe that it
possible to extend the range of applicability of existing algorithms. Numerical
examples and reference values are given.

Based on the author of the experimental results and their treatment, a model
that demonstrates that the real dispersive medium in spectral regions where the
refractive index greater than unity, the velocity of propagation of photons in
this environment corresponds to the phase velocity of light. These portions of
the spectrum (for example, atomic potassium vapor or other alkali metal) are
from low-frequency side of the main lines of the doublet and are available for
research using tunable lasers. In the calculations took into account the fact
that the atomic vapor of alkali metal used as a dispersing medium, in
accordance with the theory of dispersion in the above sections of the spectrum,

distribution across the beam - in the shadows refractive index n ({\nu}) is
greater than unity, and the axis of the beam, where the radiation intensity is
maximum - for radiation following the leading edge of the light pulse, the
refractive index is unity, which ensures smooth on the beam axis, without any

appearance of the shadow cone of Vavilov - Cherenkov radiation, indicating a
slow propagation of photons from the source of the cone with phase velocity c /

emerging. Those applications need reliability and respect of time constraints.
The underlying mechanisms such as MAC and routing must handle such
requirements. Our approach to the time constraint problem is to bound the
hop-count between a node and the sink and the time it takes to do a hop so the
end-to-end delay can be bounded and the communications are thus real-time. For
reliability purpose we propose to select forwarder nodes depending on how they
are connected in the direction of the sink. In order to be able to do so we
need a coordinate (or a metric) that gives information on hop-count, that
allows to strongly differentiate nodes and gives information on the
connectivity of each node keeping in mind the intrinsic constraints of WSWs
such as energy consumption, autonomy, etc. Due to the efficiency and
scalability of greedy routing in WSNs and the financial cost of GPS chips,
Virtual Coordinate Systems (VCSs) for WSNs have been proposed. A category of
VCSs is based on the hop-count from the sink, this scheme leads to many nodes
having the same coordinate. The main advantage of this system is that the hops
number of a packet from a source to the sink is known. Nevertheless, it does
not allow to differentiate the nodes with the same hop-count. In this report we
propose a novel hop-count-based VCS which aims at classifying the nodes having
the same hop-count depending on their connectivity and at differentiating nodes
in a 2-hop neighborhood. Those properties make the coordinates, which also can
be viewed as a local identifier, a very powerful metric which can be used in
WSNs mechanisms.

servers, subnets). Each component is either in a healthy state (0) or an
abnormal state (1). Due to random intrusions, the state of each component
transits from 0 to 1 over time according to certain stochastic process. At each
time, a subset of K (K < N) components are checked and those observed in
abnormal states are fixed. The objective is to design the optimal scheduling
for intrusion detection such that the long-term network cost incurred by all
abnormal components is minimized. We formulate the problem as a special class
of Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) process. A general RMAB suffers from the
curse of dimensionality (PSPACE-hard) and numerical methods are often
inapplicable. We show that, for this class of RMAB, Whittle index exists and
can be obtained in closed form, leading to a low-complexity implementation of
Whittle index policy with a strong performance. For homogeneous components,
Whittle index policy is shown to have a simple structure that does not require
any prior knowledge on the intrusion processes. Based on this structure,
Whittle index policy is further shown to be optimal over a finite time horizon
with an arbitrary length. Beyond intrusion detection, these results also find
applications in queuing networks with finite-size buffers.

in the nucleus, which is four times as large as the average line ratio in the
spiral arms, suggesting that the molecular gas there must be affected by the
radiation arising from the AGN. On the other hand, the line ratios in the
spiral arms vary over a wide range from 0.24 to 2.34 with a average value
around 0.75, which is similar to the line ratios of star-formation regions,
indicating that the molecular gas is affected by star formation. Besides, we
see a tight correlation between CO(3-2)/(1-0) ratios in the spiral arms and
star formation rate surface densities derived from Spitzer 8 {\mu}m dust flux
densities. We also compare the CO(3-2)/(1-0) ratio and the star formation rate
at different positions within the spiral arms; both are found to decrease as
the radius from the nucleus increases.

observations of V773 Tau A, the 51-day binary subsystem in the multiple young
stellar system V773 Tau. Combined with previous interferometric and radial
velocity measurements, these new data enable us to improve the characterization
of the physical orbit of the A subsystem. In particular, we infer updated
dynamical masses for the primary and the secondary components of 1.55 pm 0.11
Msun, and 1.293 pm 0.068 Msun, respectively, and an updated orbital parallax
distance to the system of 135.7 pm 3.2 pc, all consistent with previous
estimates. Using the improved orbit, we can calculate the absolute coordinates
of the barycenter of V773 Tau A at each epoch of our VLBA observations, and fit
for its trigonometric parallax and proper motion. This provides a direct
measurement of the distance to the system almost entirely independent of the
orbit modeling. The best fit yields a distance of 129.9 pm 3.2 pc, in good
agreement (i.e. within 1 sigma) with the distance estimate based on the orbital
fit. Taking the mean value of the orbital and trigonometric parallaxes, we
conclude that V773 Tau is located at d =132.8 pm 2.3 pc. The accuracy of this
determination is nearly one order of magnitude better than that of previous
estimates. In projection, V773 Tau and two other young stars (Hubble 4 and HDE
283572) recently observed with the VLBA are located toward the dark cloud Lynds
1495, in the central region of Taurus. These three stars appear to have similar
trigonometric parallaxes, radial velocities, and proper motions, and we argue
that the weighted mean and dispersion of their distances (d = 131.4 pc and

light curve, etc.) of Cepheids strongly depend on the pulsation period, with
the exception of the pulsation amplitude. A possible factor causing a wide
range of pulsation amplitudes might be the different atmospheric metallicities
of individual Cepheids.
  We studied the influence exerted by the atmospheric iron content, [Fe/H], on
the pulsational amplitude of Galactic Cepheids. We searched for correlations
between the [Fe/H] value and both the observed amplitudes and amplitude related
parameters.
  The amplitude of the Cepheid pulsation slightly decreases with increasing
iron abundance. This effect is more pronounced for the radial velocity
variations and for the shorter pulsation periods. The wavelength dependence of
photometric amplitudes is also found to be sensitive to the metallicity. Some
of these effects are not consequences of differential line blanketing. Based on
the calibrations of the metallicity sensitivity relationships, we derived
photometric iron abundance for 21 Galactic Cepheids. The dichotomic behaviour
dividing Galactic Cepheids that pulsate in the fundamental mode into short- and
long-period groups at the period of 10.47 d can be noticed in some diagrams
that show metallicity-related dependences.
  We confirm that variety in atmospheric metallicity in Cepheids contributes to
the finite range of pulsation amplitudes at a given period. Effects of
metallicity on the amplitudes revealed from observational data and the
occurrence of the dichotomy also derived from phenomenological data have to be
confirmed by appropriate theoretical models of stellar structure and pulsation.

regulatory motif is active during cell differentiation and is thought to act as
a memory device, being able to choose and maintain cell fate decisions. In this
contribution, we study the stability and dynamics of a two-stage gene
expression switch within a probabilistic framework inspired by the properties
of the Pu/Gata toggle switch in myeloid progenitor cells. We focus on low mRNA
numbers, high protein abundance and monomeric transcription factor binding.
Contrary to the expectation from a deterministic description, this switch shows
complex multi-attractor dy- namics without autoactivation and cooperativity.
Most importantly, the four attractors of the system, which only emerge in a
probabilistic two-stage description, can be identified with committed and
primed states in cell differentiation. We first study the dynamics of the
system and infer the mechanisms that move the system between attractors using
both the quasi-potential and the probability flux of the system. Second, we
show that the residence times of the system in one of the committed attractors
are geometrically distributed and provide an analytical expression of the
distribution. Most importantly we find that the mean residence time increases
linearly with the mean protein level. Finally, we study the implications of
this distribution for the stability of a switch and discuss the influence of
the stability on a specific cell differentiation mechanism. Our model explains
lineage priming and proposes the need of either high protein numbers or long
term modifications such as chromatin remodeling to achieve stable cell fate
decisions. Notably we present a system with high protein abundance that
nevertheless requires a probabilistic description to exhibit multistability,
complex switching dynamics and lineage priming.

enhancement on the so-defined CaII indices, we have compared indices measured
on the SSA spectra with those on the NSSA ones at the same terns of stellar
parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]), and luckily, little influences of
alpha-element enhancement has been found. Furthermore, comparisons of synthetic

times for k-mers to appear during DNA evolution under the assumption that the
considered k-mers do not occur in the initial DNA sequence, an issue arising
when studying the evolution of regulatory DNA sequences with regard to
transcription factor (TF) binding site emergence. The mathematical analysis
underlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest
do not overlap. We relax here this assumption by use of an automata approach.
In an alphabet of size 4 like the DNA alphabet, most words have no or a low
autocorrelation; therefore, globally, our results confirm those of Behrens and
Vingron. The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated
k-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of
occurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the
waiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing
TF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting
autocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the
accuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to
appear during DNA evolution. We do the computation in the Bernoulli or M0
model; computations in the M1 model, a Markov model of order 1, are more costly
in terms of time and memory but should produce similar results. While Behrens
and Vingron considered specifically promoters of length 1000, we extend the
results to promoters of any size; we exhibit the property that the probability
that a k-mer occurs at generation time 1 while being absent at time 0 behaves
linearly with respect to the length of the promoter, which induces a hyperbolic
behaviour of the waiting time of any k-mer with respect to the length of the
promoter.

generalized $k$-edge-connectivity of a complete graph is obtained. For $k\geq

in $\Re^2$ using moving sensors that take measurements along their path. It is
inexpensive to increase the sampling rate along the paths of the sensors but
more expensive to increase the total distance traveled by the sensors per unit
area, which we call the \emph{path density}. In this paper we introduce the
problem of designing sensor trajectories that are minimal in path density
subject to the condition that the measurements of the field on these
trajectories admit perfect reconstruction of bandlimited fields. We study
various possible designs of sampling trajectories. Generalizing some ideas from
the classical theory of sampling on lattices, we obtain necessary and
sufficient conditions on the trajectories for perfect reconstruction. We show
that a single set of equispaced parallel lines has the lowest path density from
certain restricted classes of trajectories that admit perfect reconstruction.
  We then generalize some of our results to higher dimensions. We first obtain
results on designing sampling trajectories in higher dimensional fields.
Further, interpreting trajectories as 1-dimensional manifolds, we extend some
of our ideas to higher dimensional sampling manifolds. We formulate the problem
of designing $\kappa$-dimensional sampling manifolds for $d$-dimensional
spatial fields that are minimal in \emph{manifold density}, a natural
generalization of the path density. We show that our results on sampling
trajectories for fields in $\Re^2$ can be generalized to analogous results on
$d-1$-dimensional sampling manifolds for $d$-dimensional spatial fields.

using reduced-dimensionality models of the complexes and concepts from

coherent states in CCCS simulations, resulting from the high dimensionality of
phase space, is tackled using a re-expansion scheme. QCT ro-vibrational product

the low density of vibrational states, QCT predicts a larger than observed
propensity for \Delta v' = -1 and -2 channels for the respective dissociation
of the first and second Ne atoms.

(SED) of a large number of stars. The SED of each star depends on the
interstellar extinction, the distance to the star, and its intrinsic SED. The
method is based on the use of stellar atmospheric models to represent the
intrinsic SEDs of the stars. Formally, it is then possible to determine the
spectral class of each star and thereby its distance. For some of the stars we
have optical spectra, allowing us to compare the photometric classification to
the spectrometric.
  We can identify one star at the front side of the globule. It has a
photometric distance of 90 pc. The closest star behind the B 335 globule has a
distance of only \approx 120 pc and we therefore determine the distance to B
335 as 90-120 pc. Our deep U image shows a relatively bright south-western rim
of the globule, and we investigate whether it might be due to a local
enhancement of the radiation field. A candidate source, located 1.5 arcminutes
outside our field, would be the field star, HD 184982. This star has an entry
in the Hipparcos Catalogue and its distance is 140-200 pc. However, we come to
the conclusion that the bright SW rim is more likely due to the wing of the
point-spread-function (PSF) of this star.

presence of strong molecular features, and incomplete line lists for the
corresponding molecules have made metallicity determinations of M dwarfs
difficult. Furthermore, the faint M dwarfs require long exposure times for a
signal-to-noise ratio sufficient for a detailed spectroscopic abundance
analysis. We present a high-resolution (R~50,000) spectroscopic study of a
sample of eight single M dwarfs and three wide-binary systems observed in the
infrared J-band. The absence of large molecular contributions allow for a
precise continuum placement. We derive metallicities based on the best fit
synthetic spectra to the observed spectra. To verify the accuracy of the
applied atmospheric models and test our synthetic spectrum approach, three
binary systems with a K-dwarf primary and an M-dwarf companion were observed
and analysed along with the single M dwarfs. We obtain a good agreement between
the metallicities derived for the primaries and secondaries of our test
binaries and thereby confirm the reliability of our method of analysing M
dwarfs. Our metallicities agree well with certain earlier determinations, and
deviate from others. We conclude that spectroscopic abundance analysis in the J
band is a reliable method for establishing the metallicity scale for M dwarfs.
We recommend its application to a larger sample covering lower as well as
higher metallicities. Further prospects of the method include abundance
determinations for individual elements.

impurity scattering, hence induces the same temperature evolutions on $1/T_1$

measured with the NA61/SHINE spectrometer at the CERN SPS. The analysis is
based on the full set of data collected in 2007 with a graphite target with a
thickness of 4% of a nuclear interaction length. Interaction cross sections and
charged pion spectra were already measured using the same set of data. These
new measurements in combination with the published ones are required to improve
predictions of the neutrino flux for the T2K long baseline neutrino oscillation
experiment in Japan. In particular, the knowledge of kaon production is crucial
for precisely predicting the intrinsic electron neutrino component and the high
energy tail of the T2K beam. The results are presented as a function of
laboratory momentum in 2 intervals of the laboratory polar angle covering the
range from 20 up to 240 mrad. The kaon spectra are compared with predictions of
several hadron production models. Using the published pion results and the new
kaon data, the K+/\pi+ ratios are computed.

'replicated time course experiment' where individual time series are observed
for a sample of biological units, such as human patients, termed replicates.
Standard practice for analysing these data sets is to fit each variable (e.g.
gene transcript) independently with a functional mixed-effects model to account
for between-replicate variance. However, such an independence assumption is
biologically implausible given that the variables are known to be highly
correlated.
  In this article we present a skew-t-normal multi-level reduced-rank
functional principal components analysis (FPCA) model for simultaneously
modelling the between-variable and between-replicate variance. The reduced-rank
FPCA model is computationally efficient and, analogously with a standard PCA
for vectorial data, provides a low dimensional representation that can be used
to identify the major patterns of temporal variation. Using an example case
study exploring the genetic response to BCG infection we demonstrate that these
low dimensional representations are eminently biologically interpretable. We
also show using a simulation study that modelling all variables simultaneously
greatly reduces the estimation error compared to the independence assumption.

molecular cloud, how particle grow and how the presence of ice coatings may
change the overall shape of the extinction curve.
  Field stars can be used to probe the cloud extinction. By combining
multi-colour photometry and IR spectroscopy the spectral class of the star can
be determined as can the extinction curve.
  We determine the reddening curve from 0.35 to 24 \mu m. The water ice band at
3.1 \mu m is weaker (\tau(3.1) = 0.4) than expected from the cloud extinction
(AV \approx 10 for the sightline to the most obscured star). On the other hand,
the CO ice band at 4.7 \mu m is strong (\tau(4.67) = 0.7) and indicates, that
the mass column density of frozen CO is about the same as that of water ice. We
show that the reddening curves for the two background stars, for which the
silicate band has been measured, can be accurately modelled from the UV to 24
\mu m. These models only include graphite and silicate grains. No need for any
additional major grain component to explain the slow decline of the reddening
curve beyond the K band. The dust model for the dense part of the cloud has
more large grains than for the rim. We propose that the well established
shallow reddening curve beyond the K band has two different explanations:
larger graphite grains in dense regions and relatively small grains in the
diffuse ISM, giving rise to substantially less extinction beyond the K band
than previously thought.
  For the sight line towards the most obscured star, we derive the relation AKs
= 0.97 \cdot E(J - Ks), and assuming that all silicon is bound in silicates,
N(2 H2 +H) \approx 1.5 \times 10^{21} \cdot AV \approx 9 \times 10^{21} \cdot
AKs. For the rim of the cloud we get AKs = 0.51 \cdot E(J - Ks), which is close
to recent determinations for the diffuse ISM. The corresponding gas column
density is N(2 H2 +H) \approx 2.3 \times 10^{21} \cdot AV \approx 3 \times
10^{22} \cdot AKs.

collection of vectors can be partitioned into a fixed number of linearly
independent sets. Such partitions exist if and only if every subset of the
vectors satisfies the so-called Rado-Horn inequality. Today there are at least
six proofs of the Rado-Horn theorem, but these tend to be extremely delicate or
require intimate knowledge of matroid theory. In this paper we provide an
elementary proof of the Rado-Horn theorem as well as elementary proofs for
several generalizations including results for the redundant case when the
hypotheses of the Rado-Horn theorem fail. Another problem with the existing
proofs of the Rado-Horn Theorem is that they give no information about how to
actually partition the vectors. We start by considering a specific partition of
the vectors, and the proof consists of showing that this is an optimal
partition. We further show how certain structures we construct in the proof are
at the heart of the Rado-Horn theorem by characterizing subsets of vectors
which maximize the Rado-Horn inequality. Lastly, we demonsrate how these
results may be used to select an optimal partition with respect to spanning
properties of the vectors.

nano-mechanical cavity composed of an oscillating mirror and containing an
optical lattice of regularly trapped atoms are studied. The system is modeled
as a three-mode system, two orthogonal polariton modes representing the coupled
optical lattice and the cavity mode, and one mechanical mode representing the
oscillating mirror. We examine separately the cases of two-mode and three-mode
interactions which are distinguished by a suitable tuning of the mechanical
mode to the polariton mode frequencies. In the two-mode case, we find that the
occurrence of entanglement between one of the polariton modes and the
mechanical mode is highly sensitive to the presence of the first-order
coherence between the modes. In particular, the creation of the first-order
coherence among the modes is achieved at the expense of entanglement between
the modes. In the three-mode case, we show that no entanglement is created
between the independent polariton modes if both modes are coupled to the
mechanical mode by the parametric interaction. There is no entanglement between
the polaritons even if the oscillating mirror is damped by a squeezed vacuum
field. The interaction creates the first-order coherence between the polaritons
and the degree of coherence can, in principle, be as large as unity. This
demonstrates that the oscillating mirror can establish the first-order
coherence between two independent thermal modes. A further analysis shows that
two independent thermal modes can be made entangled in the system only when one
of the modes is coupled to the intermediate mode by a parametric interaction
and the other is coupled by a linear-mixing interaction.

sophisticated implementation, at the level of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for
the gluon propagator, of the Schwinger mechanism, whose central dynamical
ingredient is the nonperturbative formation of longitudinally coupled massless
bound-state excitations. In addition to triggering the aforementioned
mechanism, these excitations introduce poles in the various off-shell Green's
functions of the theory, in such a way as to maintain the Slavnov-Taylor
identities intact in the presence of massive gluon propagators, acting
effectively as composite Nambu-Goldstone bosons. In this work we focus on the
dynamics leading to the actual formation of such bound states. Specifically, we
derive and solve numerically an approximate version of the homogeneous
Bethe-Salpeter equation governing the wave function of this special bound
state. It is found that this integral equation admits physically meaningful
non-trivial solutions, indicating that the QCD dynamics produce one of the
crucial ingredients required for the gauge-invariant generation of a gluon
mass.

The change in the slope of the model longitude profiles in the inner few
degrees is caused by a transition from highly elongated to more nearly
axisymmetric isodensity contours in the inner boxy bulge. This transition is
confined to a few degrees from the Galactic plane, thus the change of slope is
predicted to disappear at higher Galactic latitudes. We also show that the
nuclear star count map derived from this simulation snapshot displays a
longitudinal asymmetry similar to that observed in the 2MASS data, but is less

semi-streaming algorithms that perform one or two passes over the input stream
for maximum matching with no restrictions on the input graph, and for the
important special case of bipartite graphs that we refer to as maximum
bipartite matching (MBM). The Greedy matching algorithm performs one pass over
the input and outputs a $1/2$ approximation. Whether there is a better one-pass
algorithm has been an open question since the appearance of the first paper on
streaming algorithms for matching problems in 2005 [Feigenbaum et al., SODA

  In the one-pass setting, we show that there is a deterministic semi-streaming
algorithm for MBM with expected approximation factor $1/2+0.005$, assuming that
edges arrive one by one in (uniform) random order. We extend this algorithm to
general graphs, and we obtain a $1/2+0.003$ approximation.
  In the two-pass setting, we do not require the random arrival order
assumption (the edge stream is in arbitrary order). We present a simple
randomized two-pass semi-streaming algorithm for MBM with expected
approximation factor $1/2 + 0.019$. Furthermore, we discuss a more involved
deterministic two-pass semi-streaming algorithm for MBM with approximation

(CHM) that come from flavor observables. In the second part we propose a novel
strategy to discover a heavy gluon ($G^*$) and heavy fermions at the LHC. We do
so by means of simple two-site effective Lagrangians, which could also be used
in further phenomenological studies on CHM. From the analysis of the bounds on
the CHM spectrum, we derive an important constraint on the masses of the heavy
fermions which does not depend on the flavor structure of the sector beyond the
SM. This bound is obtained from the infrared contribution to $b \to s\gamma$
induced by the flavor-conserving effective vertex $Wt_Rb_R$. We find that the
presence of a custodial symmetry can play a role in protecting this effective
coupling. Studying the heavy colored vectors phenomenology, we find that heavy
composite fermions have a great impact on the phenomenology of heavy composite
gluon at the LHC. If the composite gluon is heavier than the composite
fermions, as flavor observables seem to suggest, the search in the channels
where $G^*$ decays into one heavy fermion plus its Standard Model partner is
very promising, with the possibility for both the $G^*$ and heavy fermions to
be discovered at the early stage of the LHC. These channels offer also the
possibility to extract important information on model's parameters, such as the
top degree of compositeness.

formula has a definite elementary value, these data structures encode several
exceptions: formulas that are ambiguous, unsatisfiable, unsteady, or
contingent. These exceptions represent several semantically different types of
undecidability; none causes any fundamental problem for mathematics. It is
simple to calculate that Goedel's formula, which asserts that it cannot be
proven, is exceptional in specific ways: interpreted statically, the formula
defines an inconsistent system of equations (thus it is called unsatisfiable);
interpreted dynamically, it defines a dynamical system that has a periodic
orbit and no fixed point (thus it is called unsteady). These exceptions are not
catastrophic failures of logic; they are accurate mathematical descriptions of
Goedel's self-referential construction. Goedel's analysis does not reveal any
essential incompleteness in formal reasoning systems, nor any barrier to
proving the consistency of such systems by ordinary mathematical means.
