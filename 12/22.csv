structures is a set of techniques that allows for efficient random sampling
algorithms for a large class of families of discrete objects. The usual
requirement of sampling uniformly from the set of objects of a given size is
somehow relaxed, though uniformity among objects of each size is still ensured.
Generating functions, rather than the enumeration sequences they are based on,
are the crucial ingredient. We give a brief description of the general theory,

$\C{F}(z)$ and $\C{G}(z)$ as well as their special values have been studied by
Mahler, Golomb, Schwarz, and Duverney; it is known that the numbers
$\C{F}(\ga)$ and $\C{G}(\ga)$ are transcendental for all algebraic numbers
$\ga$ which satisfy $0<\ga<1$.
  For a sequence $\mathbf{u}$, denote the Hankel matrix
$H_n^p(\mathbf{u}):=(u({p+i+j-2}))_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant n}$. Let $\ga$ be a
real number. The {\em irrationality exponent} $\mu(\ga)$ is defined as the
supremum of the set of real numbers $\mu$ such that the inequality
$|\ga-p/q|<q^{-\mu}$ has infinitely many solutions $(p,q)\in\B{Z}\times\B{N}.$
  In this paper, we first prove that the determinants of $H_n^1(\mathbf{g})$
and $H_n^1(\mathbf{f})$ are nonzero for every $n\geqslant 1$. We then use this
result to prove that for $b\geqslant 2$ the irrationality exponents
$\mu(\C{F}(1/b))$ and $\mu(\C{G}(1/b))$ are equal to 2; in particular, the
irrationality exponent of the sum of the reciprocals of the Fermat numbers is
2.

elementary particles is concerned and, in particular, in the context of the
spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) mechanism. We describe a version of the SSB
mechanism in which gravity plays a direct role. We work in the context of
diffeomorphism invariant gauge theories, which exist for any non-abelian gauge
group G, and which have second order in derivatives field equations. We show
that any (non-trivial) vacuum solution of such a theory gives rise to an
embedding of the group SU(2) into G, and thus breaks G down to SU(2) times its
centralizer in G. The components of the connection charged under SU(2) can then
be seen to describe gravitons, with the SU(2) itself playing the role of the
chiral half of the Lorentz group. Components charged under the centralizer
describe the usual Yang-Mills gauge bosons. The remaining components describe
massive particles. This breaking of symmetry explains (in the context of models
considered) how gravity and Yang-Mills can come from a single underlying theory
while being so different in the physics they describe. Further, varying the
vacuum solution, and thus the embedding of SU(2) into G, one can break the
Yang-Mills gauge group as desired, with massless gauge bosons of one vacuum
acquiring mass in another. There is no Higgs field in our version of the SSB
mechanism, the only variable is a connection field. Instead of the symmetry
breaking by a dedicated Higgs field pointing in some direction in the field
space, our theories break the symmetry by choosing how the group of ""internal""
gauge rotations of gravity (the chiral half of the Lorentz group) sits inside
the full gauge group.

symmetric representations of the standard model are generically needed for the
compensation of mixed anomalies. The key point is that their masses are also
protected by flavour symmetries and some of them are expected to lie way below
the flavour symmetry breaking scale(s), which has to occur many orders of
magnitude above the electroweak scale to be compatible with the available data
from flavour changing neutral currents and CP violation experiments. We argue
that, actually, some of these fermions would plausibly get masses within the
LHC range. If they are taken to be heavy quarks and leptons, in
(bi)-fundamental representations of the standard model symmetries, their
mixings with the light ones are strongly constrained to be very small by
electroweak precision data. The alternative chosen here is to exactly forbid
such mixings by breaking of flavour symmetries into an exact discrete symmetry,
the so-called proton-hexality, primarily suggested to avoid proton decay. As a
consequence of the large value needed for the flavour breaking scale, those
heavy particles are long-lived and rather appropriate for the current and
future searches at the LHC for quasi-stable hadrons and leptons. In fact, the
LHC experiments have already started to look for them.

intervening systems along the line of sight. Making use of the spectral index
connecting optical and X-ray fluxes at 11 hr (beta_OX), we investigate the
relation of the intrinsic column density and the GRB `darkness'. We find that
there is a very tight correlation between dark GRBs and high X-ray column

superconductors and related materials. We review the historical progress
including RSXS studies of Wigner crystallization in spin ladder materials,
stripe order in 214-phase nickelates, 214-phase cuprates, and other systems.
  One of the major outstanding issues in RSXS concerns its relationship to more
established valence band probes, namely angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES)
and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). These techniques are widely understood
as measuring a one-electron spectral function, yet a relationship between RSXS
and a spectral function has so far been unclear. Using physical arguments that
apply at the oxygen $K$ edge, we show that RSXS measures the square modulus of
an advanced version of the Green's function measured with STM. This indicates
that, despite being a momentum space probe, RSXS is more closely related to STM
than to ARPES techniques.
  Finally, we close with some discussion of the most promising future
directions for RSXS. We will argue that the most promising area lies in high
magnetic field studies, particularly of edge states in strongly correlated
heterostructures, and the vortex state in superconducting cuprates, where RSXS
may clarify the anomalous periodicities observed in recent quantum oscillation

The key result is a positive-characteristic version of the Torelli theorem that

kernels to characteristic zero. As a consequence, any Shioda-supersingular K3
surface is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its derived category of
coherent sheaves. We also study different realizations of Mukai's Hodge
structure in algebraic cohomology theories (etale, crystalline, de Rham) and

following and reaching multiple food sources can evolve de novo, by evaluating
each organism on multiple food sources placed on a basic pattern that is
gradually randomized across generations. We devised a strategy of evolutionary
""staging"", where the best organism from a set of evolutionary experiments using
a particular fitness function is used to seed a new set, with a fitness
function that is progressively altered to better challenge organisms as
evolution improves them. We find that an organism's efficiency at reaching the
first food source does not predict its ability at finding subsequent ones
because foraging efficiency crucially depends on the position of the last food
source reached, an effect illustrated by ""foraging maps"" that capture the
organism's controller state, body position, and orientation. Our best evolved
foragers are able to reach multiple food sources over 90% of the time on

viscosity by the artificial viscosity term in situations involving rotation.
Existing approaches for quantifying its effect include approximate analytic
formulae and disc-averaged be- haviour in specific ring-spreading simulations,
based on the kinematic effects produced by the artificial viscosity. These
methods have disadvantages, in that they typically are applicable to a very
small range of physical scenarios, have a large number of simplifying
assumptions, and often are tied to specific SPH formulations which do not
include corrective (e.g., Balsara) or time-dependent viscosity terms. In this
study we have developed a simple, generally applicable and practical technique
for evaluating the local effect of artificial viscosity directly from the
creation of specific entropy for each SPH particle. This local approach is
simple and quick to implement, and it al- lows a detailed characterization of
viscous effects as a function of position. Several advantages of this method
are discussed, including its ease in evaluation, its greater accuracy and its
broad applicability. In order to compare this new method with ex- isting ones,
simple disc flow examples are used. Even in these basic cases, the very roughly
approximate nature of the previous methods is shown. Our local method pro-
vides a detailed description of the effects of the artificial viscosity
throughout the disc, even for extended examples which implement Balsara
corrections. As a further use of this approach, explicit dependencies of the
effective viscosity in terms of SPH and flow parameters are estimated from the
example cases. In an appendix, a method for the initial placement of SPH
particles is discussed which is very effective in reducing numerical

limited theoretical understanding of how individual heterogeneity relates to
network heterogeneity. The model presented here provides a framework linking an
individual's skill set to her position in the collaboration network, and the
distribution of skills in the population to the structure of the collaboration
network as a whole. This model suggests that there is a non-trivial
relationship between skills and network position: individuals with a useful
combination of skills will have a disproportionate number of links in the
network. Indeed, in some cases, an individual's degree is non-monotonic in the
number of skills she has--an individual with very few skills may outperform an
individual with many. Special cases of the model suggest that the degree
distribution of the network will be skewed, even when the distribution of
skills is uniform in the population. The degree distribution becomes more
skewed as problems become more difficult, leading to a community dominated by a
few high-degree superstars. This has striking implications for labor market
outcomes in industries where production is largely the result of collaborative
effort.

entire system inoperable. A virtual machine monitor for each kernel keeps track
of shadow page table mappings that control immutable memory access
capabilities. This ensures a level of security and fault tolerance in
situations where a service in one kernel fails, or is corrupted by a malicious
attack. Communication is supported between kernels using shared memory regions
for message passing. Similarly, device driver data structures are shareable
between kernels to avoid the need for complex I/O virtualization, or
communication with a dedicated kernel responsible for I/O. In Quest-V, device
interrupts are delivered directly to a kernel, rather than via a monitor that
determines the destination. Apart from bootstrapping each kernel, handling
faults and managing shadow page tables, the monitors are not needed. This
differs from conventional virtual machine systems in which a central monitor,
or hypervisor, is responsible for scheduling and management of host resources
amongst a set of guest kernels. In this paper we show how Quest-V can implement
novel fault isolation and recovery techniques that are not possible with
conventional systems. We also show how the costs of using virtualization for
isolation of system services does not add undue overheads to the overall system
performance.

functional analysis by considering a sequence $(\norm_n : n\in\N)$ of norms,
where $\norm_n$ is defined on the product space $E^n$ for each $n\in\N$.
  Our theory is analogous to, but distinct from, an existing theory of
`operator spaces'; it is designed to relate to general spaces $L^p$ for $p\in
[1,\infty]$, and in particular to $L^1$-spaces, rather than to $L^2$-spaces.
  After recalling in Chapter 1 some results in functional analysis, especially
in Banach space, Hilbert space, Banach algebra, and Banach lattice theory that
we shall use, we shall present in Chapter 2 our axiomatic definition of a
`multi-normed space' $((E^n, \norm_n) : n\in \N)$, where $(E, \norm)$ is a
normed space. Several different, equivalent, characterizations of multi-normed
spaces are given, some involving the theory of tensor products; key examples of
multi-norms are the minimum and maximum multi-norm based on a given space.
Multi-norms measure `geometrical features' of normed spaces, in particular by
considering their `rate of growth'. There is a strong connection between
multi-normed spaces and the theory of absolutely summing operators.
  A substantial number of examples of multi-norms will be presented.
  Following the pattern of standard presentations of the foundations of
functional analysis, we consider generalizations to `multi-topological linear
spaces' through `multi-null sequences', and to `multi-bounded' linear
operators, which are exactly the `multi-continuous' operators. We define a new
Banach space ${\mathcal M}(E,F)$ of multi-bounded operators, and show that it
generalizes well-known spaces, especially in the theory of Banach lattices.
  We conclude with a theory of `orthogonal decompositions' of a normed space
with respect to a multi-norm, and apply this to construct a `multi-dual' space.

approximate output to a function $f$ computed over the union of the inputs. The
goal is to minimize the communication.
  We show the randomized communication complexity of estimating the number of

improving the previous $\Omega(k + 1/\eps^2)$ bound and matching known upper
bounds up to a logarithmic factor. For the $p$-th frequency moment $F_p$, $p >

$\tilde{\Omega}(k^{p-1}/\eps^2)$. We obtain similar improvements for heavy

estimate $F_p$, for any $p > 1$, using $\tilde{O}(k^{p-1}\poly(\eps^{-1}))$
communication. This greatly improves upon the previous

Majorana particles which couple to a light Standard Model fermion and an extra
scalar via a Yukawa coupling. In this scenario, the annihilation rate into the
light fermions with the mediation of the scalar particle is strongly suppressed
by the mass of the fermion. Nevertheless, the helicity suppression is lifted by
the associated emission of a gauge boson, yielding annihilation rates which
could be large enough to allow the indirect detection of the dark matter
particles. We perform a general analysis of this scenario, calculating the
annihilation cross section of the processes \chi\chi\rightarrow f\bar f V when
the dark matter particle is a SU(2)_L singlet or doublet, f is a lepton or a
quark, and V is a photon, a weak gauge boson or a gluon. We point out that the
annihilation rate is particularly enhanced when the dark matter particle is
degenerate in mass to the intermediate scalar particle, which is a scenario
barely constrained by collider searches of exotic charged or colored particles.
Lastly, we derive upper limits on the relevant cross sections from the
non-observation of an excess in the cosmic antiproton-to-proton ratio measured
by PAMELA.

cross-correlated with HK detections in UKIDSS DR8. Thus the selection criteria
are completely independent of stellar mass, effective temperature above 8000 K,
and the presence (or absence) of atmospheric metals. The infrared fluxes of one
target are compatible with a spatially-unresolved late M or early L-type
companion, while three stars exhibit excess emissions consistent with warm
circumstellar dust. These latter targets have spectral energy distributions
similar to known dusty white dwarfs with high fractional infrared luminosities

accretion of circumstellar material. One of the disks exhibits a gaseous
component - the fourth reported to date - and orbits a relatively cool star,
indicating the gas is produced via collisions as opposed to sublimation,
supporting the picture of a recent event. The resulting statistics yield a
lower limit of 0.8% for the fraction dust disks at DA-type white dwarfs with

the so-called branch singularity located at a finite physical radius in the
bulk spacetime plays an essential role. We show that a three-brane moving in
the bulk may reach and pass through it in spite of the fact that it is a
curvature singularity. The bulk spacetime is extended beyond the branch
singularity in the C^0 sense and then the branch singularity is identified as a
massive thin shell. From the bulk point of view, this process is the collision
of the three-brane with the shell of branch singularity. From the point of view
on the brane, this process is a sudden transition from the collapsing phase to
the expanding phase of the universe. The present result opens a completely new
possibility to achieve the bouncing brane universe as a higher-curvature
effect.

for dissipation of the field energy via spontaneous emission. The drag force
exists if the atomic polarizability has a nonvanishing imaginary part. Here, we
explore alternative derivations. The damping of the motion of a simple harmonic
oscillator is described by radiative reaction theory (result of Einstein and
Hopf), taking into account the known stochastic fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field. Describing the excitations of the atom as an ensemble of
damped harmonic oscillators, we identify the previously found expressions as
generalizations of the Einstein-Hopf result. In addition, we present a simple
explanation for blackbody friction in terms of a Doppler shift of the thermal
radiation in the inertial frame of the moving atom: The atom absorbs
blue-shifted photons from the front and radiates off energy in all directions,
thereby losing energy. The original plus the two alternative derivations

approaching 10^53 ergs, these supernovae are expected to be within the
detection limits of the upcoming James Webb Space telescope (JWST), allowing
observational constraints to be placed on the properties of the first stars. We
estimate the source density of PISNe using a semi-analytic halo mass function
based approach, accounting for the effects of feedback from star formation on
the PISN rates using cosmological simulations. We estimate an upper limit of
~0.2 PISNe per JWST field of view at any given time. Feedback can reduce this
rate significantly, e.g., lowering it to as little as one PISN per 4000 JWST
fields of view for the most pessimistic explosion models. We also find that the
main obstacle to observing PISNe from the first stars is their scarcity, not
their faintness; exposures longer than a few times 10^4s will do little to
increase the number of PISNe found. Given this we suggest a mosaic style search
strategy for detecting PISNe from the first stars. Even rather high redshift
PISNe are unlikely to be missed by moderate exposures, and a large number of
pointings will be required to ensure a detection.

matrix model is defined by taking the low energy limit of a holomorphic
Chern-Simons theory on CP(3|4), in the presence of a large instanton flux. The
theory comes with a choice of S(4) radius L and a parameter N controlling the
overall size of the matrices. The flat space variant of the 4D effective theory
arises by taking the large N scaling limit of the matrix model, with l_pl^2 ~
L^2 / N held fixed. Its massless spectrum contains both spin one and spin two
excitations, which we identify with gluons and gravitons. As shown in the
companion paper, the matrix model correlation functions of both these
excitations correctly reproduce the corresponding MHV scattering amplitudes. We
present evidence that the scaling limit defines a gravitational theory with a
finite Planck length. In particular we find that in the l_pl -> 0 limit, the
matrix model makes contact with the CSW rules for amplitudes of pure gauge
theory, which are uncontaminated by conformal supergravity. We also propose a
UV completion for the system by embedding the matrix model in the physical
superstring.

Why was the event size so grossly under-estimated? (2) How should we evaluate
the chances of giant earthquakes in subduction zones? and (3) What is the
repeat time for magnitude 9 earthquakes off the Tohoku coast? The ""maximum
earthquake size"" is often guessed from the available history of earthquakes, a
method known for its significant downward bias. There are two quantitative
methods for estimating the maximum magnitude in any region: a statistical
analysis of the available earthquake record, and the moment conservation
principle. However, for individual zones the statistical method is usually
ineffective in estimating the maximum magnitude; only the lower limit can be
evaluated. The moment conservation technique matches the tectonic deformation
rate to that predicted by earthquakes. For subduction zones, the seismic or
historical record is insufficient to constrain either the maximum or corner
magnitude. However, the moment conservation principle yields consistent
estimates: for all the subduction zones the maximum magnitude is of the order
9.0--9.7. Moreover, moment conservation indicates that variations in estimated
maximum magnitude among subduction zones are not statistically significant.
Another moment conservation method also suggests that magnitude 9 events are
required to explain observed displacement rates. The global rate of magnitude 9
earthquakes in subduction zones, predicted from statistical analysis of

from resampling of finite populations (genetic drift) and the random genetic
background of nearby selected alleles on which the neutral alleles are found
(linked selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection plays an
important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of
the best investigated models of linked selection is the recurrent full sweep
model, in which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined for rapid
fixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent selective sweeps in a
coalescent framework, one that generalizes the recurrent full sweep model to
the case where selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects
the genealogy at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions
are unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the
theory to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps
on levels of neutral diversity, and find that for a given reduction in
diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at
neutral sites is determined primarily by the frequencies achieved by the
selected alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low
frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the
frequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent
model under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard
neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe goes some way
towards providing a more flexible framework to describe genomic patterns of
diversity than is currently available.

losing asteroids (also called ""main-belt comets"") can in fact be driven by a
surprising diversity of mechanisms. In this paper, we consider eleven dynamical
asteroids losing mass, in nine of which the ejected material is spatially
resolved. We address mechanisms for producing mass loss including rotational
instability, impact ejection, electrostatic repulsion, radiation pressure
sweeping, dehydration stresses and thermal fracture, in addition to the
sublimation of ice. In two objects (133P and 238P) the repetitive nature of the
observed activity leaves ice sublimation as the only reasonable explanation
while, in a third ((596) Scheila), a recent impact is the cause. Another impact
may account for activity in P/2010 A2 but this tiny object can also be
explained as having shed mass after reaching rotational instability. Mass loss
from (3200) Phaethon is probably due to cracking or dehydration at extreme
(~1000 K) perihelion temperatures, perhaps aided by radiation pressure
sweeping. For the other bodies, the mass loss mechanisms remain unidentified,
pending the acquisition of more and better data. While the active asteroid
sample size remains small, the evidence for an astonishing diversity of mass
loss processes in these bodies is clear.

system for investigating the evolution of a small radio source through its host

automatically identified 160,079 bipolar magnetic regions that span a range of
scale sizes across nearly four orders of magnitude. Their properties have been
statistically analyzed, in particular with respect to the polarity orientations
of the bipolar regions, including their tilt angle distributions. The latitude
variation of the average tilt angles (with respect to the E-W direction), known
as Joy's law, is found to closely follow the relation 32.1*sin(latitude)[deg].
There is no indication of a dependence on region size that one may expect if
the tilts were produced by the Coriolis force during the buoyant rise of flux
loops from the tachocline region. A few percent of all regions have
orientations that violate Hale's polarity law. We show examples, from different
phases of the solar cycle, where well defined medium-size bipolar regions with
opposite polarity orientations occur side by side in the same latitude zone.
Such oppositely oriented large bipolar regions cannot be part of the same
toroidal flux system, but different flux systems must coexist in the same
latitude zones. These examples are incompatible with the paradigm of coherent,
subsurface toroidal flux ropes as the source of sunspots, and instead show that
fluctuations must play a major role at all scales for the turbulent dynamo. We
see no observational support for a separation of scales or a division between a
global and a local dynamo, since also the smallest scales in the data set
retain a non-random component that significantly contributes to the accumulated
emergence of a N-S dipole moment that leads to the replacement of the old
global poloidal field with a new one that has the opposite orientation.

stellar populations of massive globular clusters (GCs) and the ultraviolet (UV)
upturn of galactic spheroids by using analytical and numerical models. In our
model, all stars are initially formed as bound or unbound star clusters (SCs)
formed from giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and the SCs can finally become GCs,
open clusters, and field stars depending on physical properties of their host
GMCs. An essential ingredient of the model is that helium-rich stars are formed
almost purely from gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars. The helium-rich star formation is assumed to occur within massive SCs if
the masses of the progenitor GMCs are larger than a threshold mass (M_thres).
These massive SCs can finally become either massive GCs or helium-rich field
stars depending on whether they are disintegrated or not. Using this model, we
show that if the initial mass functions (IMFs) in galactic spheroids are mildly
top-heavy, then the mass fractions of helium-rich main-sequence stars (F_He)
can be as large as ~ 0.1 for M_thres=10^7 M_sun. F_He is found to depend on
IMFs and M_thres such that it can be larger for shallower IMFs and smaller
M_thres. The inner regions of galactic spheroids show larger F_He in almost all
models. Based on these results, we suggest that if the UV upturn of elliptical
galaxies is due to the larger fractions of helium-rich stars, then the origin
can be closely associated with top-heavy IMFs in the galaxies.

notion of connective representation. But examples of connective representations
often come from dynamical systems. And this is even more obvious when we study
the adjoint notion of connective foliation. To apply those notions to dynamics,
we first need to consider dynamical systems in an unified way. This is done

protoplanetary disk created by radially inhomogeneous magnetorotational
instability (MRI), through three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations
including dust particles. In our previous papers, we showed that the
inhomogeneous MRI developing in non-uniform structure of magnetic field or
magnetic resistivity can transform the local gas flow in the disk to a
quasi-steady state with local rigid rotation that is no more unstable against
the MRI. Since the outer part of the rigid rotation is super-Keplerian flow, a
quasi-static pressure bump is created and dust concentration is expected there.
In this paper, we perform simulations of the same systems, adding dust
particles that suffer gas drag and modulate gas flow via the back-reaction of
the gas drag (dust drag). We use O(10^7) super-particles, each of which
represents many dust particles with sizes of centimeter to meter. We have found
that the dust drag suppresses turbulent motion to decrease the velocity
dispersion of the dust particles while it broadens the dust concentrated
regions to limit peaky dust concentration, compared with the simulation without
the dust drag. We found that reduction in the velocity dispersion) is dominated
over the suppression in particle concentration. For meter-size particles with
the friction time ~1/Omega, where Omega is Keplerian frequency, the
gravitational instability of the dust particles that may lead to planetesimal
formation is expected. For such a situation, we further introduced the
self-gravity of dust particles to the simulation to demonstrate that several
gravitationally bound clumps are actually formed. Through analytical arguments,
we found that the planetesimal formation from meter-sized dust particles can be
possible at ~5AU, if dust spatial density is a few times larger than that in
the minimum mass solar nebula.

is well known that the morphological changes occurring during the progression
of diseases like cancer manifest in their optical properties which can be
probed for differentiating the various stages of cancer. Here, we use the
multi-resolution properties of the wavelet transform to analyze the optical
changes. For this, we have used a novel laser imagery technique which provides
us with a composite image of the absorption by the different cellular
organelles. As the disease progresses, due to the growth of new cells, the
ratio of the organelle to cellular volume changes manifesting in the laser
imagery of such tissues. In order to develop a metric that can quantify the
changes in such systems, we make use of the wavelet-based fluctuation analysis.
The changing self- similarity during disease progression can be well
characterized by the Hurst exponent and the scaling exponent. Due to the use of
the Daubechies' family of wavelet kernels, we can extract polynomial trends of
different orders, which help us characterize the underlying processes
effectively. In this study, we observe that the Hurst exponent decreases as the
cancer progresses. This measure could be relatively used to differentiate
between different stages of cancer which could lead to the development of a
novel non-invasive method for cancer detection and characterization.

nonlinearity, even worse when maneuvers, e.g., tumbling techniques, are
employed to improve the alignment. There is no general rule to attack the
observability of a nonlinear system, so most previous works addressed the
observability of the corresponding linearized system by implicitly assuming
that the original nonlinear system and the linearized one have identical
observability characteristics. Strapdown INS alignment is a nonlinear system
that has its own characteristics. Using the inherent properties of strapdown
INS, e.g., the attitude evolution on the SO(3) manifold, we start from the
basic definition and develop a global and constructive approach to investigate
the observability of strapdown INS static and tumbling alignment, highlighting
the effects of the attitude maneuver on observability. We prove that strapdown
INS alignment, considering the unknown constant sensor biases, will be
completely observable if the strapdown INS is rotated successively about two
different axes and will be nearly observable for finite known unobservable
states (no more than two) if it is rotated about a single axis. Observability
from a global perspective provides us with insights into and a clearer picture
of the problem, shedding light on previous theoretical results on strapdown INS
alignment that were not comprehensive or consistent.. The reporting of
inconsistencies calls for a review of all linearization-based observability
studies in the vast literature. Extensive simulations with constructed ideal
observers and an extended Kalman filter are carried out, and the numerical
results accord with the analysis. The conclusions can also assist in designing
the optimal tumbling strategy and the appropriate state observer in practice to
maximize the alignment performance.

[Fe/H]>=0, showed that the abundances of neutron-rich elements have continued
to increase in the Galaxy after the formation of the Sun, roughly maintaining a
solar-like distribution. Such a trend requires neutron fluences larger than
those so far assumed, as these last would have too few neutrons per iron seed.
We suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in
AGB stars of low mass (M < 1.5M\odot), if they release neutrons from the
^{13}C({\alpha},n)^{16}O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of 4 than
assumed in more massive AGBs (M > 1.5M\odot). Adopting such a stronger neutron
source as a contributor to the abundances at the time of formation of the Sun,
we show that this affects also the solar s-process distribution, so that its
main component is well reproduced, without the need of assuming ad-hoc primary
sources for the synthesis of s elements up to A \sim 130, contrary to
suggestions from other works. The changes in the expected abundances that we
find are primarily due to the following reasons. i) Enhancing the neutron
source increases the efficiency of the s process, so that the ensuing stellar
yields now mimic the solar distribution at a metallicity higher than before
([Fe/H]>=-0.1). ii) The age-metallicity relation is rather flat for several Gyr
in that metallicity regime, so that those conditions remain stable and the
enhanced nuclear yields, which are necessary to maintain a solar-like abundance
pattern, can dominate the composition of the interstellar medium from which
subsequent stars are formed.

structure is a network where nodes with almost the same degree are connected.
Motivated by this work, we propose and analyze, based on analytical
considerations, an onion-like candidate for a nearly optimal structure against
simultaneous random and targeted high degree node attacks. The nearly optimal
structure can be viewed as a hierarchically interconnected random regular
graphs, the degrees and populations of which are specified by the degree
distribution. This network structure exhibits an extremely assortative
degree-degree correlation and has a close relationship to the ""onion

calculate the critical percolation threshold and the giant component of a
correlated network for an arbitrary type of node removal, we apply the theory
to the cases of random scale-free networks that are highly vulnerable against
targeted high degree node removal. Our results show that this vulnerability can
be significantly reduced by implementing this onion-like type of degree-degree
correlation without much undermining the almost complete robustness against
random node removal. We also investigate in detail the robustness enhancement
due to assortative degree-degree correlation by introducing a joint
degree-degree probability matrix that interpolates between an uncorrelated
network structure and the onion-like structure proposed here by tuning a single
control parameter. The optimal values of the control parameter that maximize
the robustness against simultaneous random and targeted attacks are also
determined. Our analytical calculations are supported by numerical simulations.

chiral models (PCM), which are nonlinear sigma models defined on Lie group
manifolds. We find that when Theta = pi, the nature of the disordered phase of
the principal chiral model is strongly affected by the topological term: it is
either a gapless conformal field theory, or it is gapped and two-fold
degenerate. The result of our paper can be used to analyze the boundary states
of three dimensional symmetry protected topological phases.

are too slow for simulation-intensive tasks such as calibration or real-time
control. In this paper, an emulator for a generic dynamic model, given by a
system of ordinary non-linear differential equations, is developed. The
non-linear differential equations are linearized and Gaussian white noise is
added to account for the non-linearities. The resulting linear stochastic
system is conditioned on a set of solutions of the non-linear equations that
have been calculated prior to the emulation. A path-integral approach is used
to derive the Gaussian distribution of the emulated solution. The solution
reveals that most of the computational burden can be shifted to the
conditioning phase of the emulator and the complexity of the actual emulation
step only scales like $\mathcal O(Nn)$ in multiplications of matrices of the
dimension of the state space. Here, $N$ is the number of time-points at which
the solution is to be emulated and $n$ the number of solutions the emulator is
conditioned on.
  The applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated with the hydrological
model logSPM.

demonstrate that there exists a boundary $b(t)$ such that $p(t)=\mathbb{P}[\tau

The approach taken is analytic, based on solving a parabolic variational
inequality to find $b$. Existence and uniqueness of the solution to this
variational inequality were proven in earlier work. In this paper, we
demonstrate that the resulting boundary $b$ does indeed have $p$ as its
boundary crossing distribution. Since little is known regarding the regularity
of $b$ arising from the variational inequality, this requires a detailed study
of the problem of computing the boundary crossing distribution of $X_t$ to a
rough boundary. Results regarding the formulation of this problem in terms of
weak solutions to the corresponding Kolmogorov forward equation are presented.

problems. I focus on automatically inventing or discovering problems in a way
inspired by the playful behavior of animals and humans, to train a more and
more general problem solver from scratch in an unsupervised fashion. Consider
the infinite set of all computable descriptions of tasks with possibly
computable solutions. The novel algorithmic framework POWERPLAY (2011)
continually searches the space of possible pairs of new tasks and modifications
of the current problem solver, until it finds a more powerful problem solver
that provably solves all previously learned tasks plus the new one, while the
unmodified predecessor does not. Wow-effects are achieved by continually making
previously learned skills more efficient such that they require less time and
space. New skills may (partially) re-use previously learned skills. POWERPLAY's
search orders candidate pairs of tasks and solver modifications by their
conditional computational (time & space) complexity, given the stored
experience so far. The new task and its corresponding task-solving skill are
those first found and validated. The computational costs of validating new
tasks need not grow with task repertoire size. POWERPLAY's ongoing search for
novelty keeps breaking the generalization abilities of its present solver. This
is related to Goedel's sequence of increasingly powerful formal theories based
on adding formerly unprovable statements to the axioms without affecting
previously provable theorems. The continually increasing repertoire of problem
solving procedures can be exploited by a parallel search for solutions to
additional externally posed tasks. POWERPLAY may be viewed as a greedy but
practical implementation of basic principles of creativity. A first
experimental analysis can be found in separate papers [53,54].

in a globular cluster with a pulsar spinning at such low rate. The accreting
pulsar is anomalous because its characteristics are very different from the
other five known slow accreting pulsars in galactic LMXBs. Many features of the
11 Hz pulsar are instead very similar to those of accreting millisecond
pulsars, spinning at frequencies >100 Hz. Understanding this anomaly is
valuable because IGR J17480-2446 can be the only accreting pulsar discovered so
far which is in the process of becoming an accreting millisecond pulsar. We
first verify that the neutron star (NS) in IGR J17480-2446 is indeed spinning
up by carefully analyzing X-ray data with coherent timing techniques that
account for the presence of timing noise. We then study the present Roche lobe
overflow epoch and the two previous spin-down epochs dominated by magneto
dipole radiation and stellar wind accretion. We find that IGR J17480-2446 is
very likely a mildly recycled pulsar and suggest that it has started a spin-up
phase in an exceptionally recent time, that has lasted less than a few 10^7 yr.

physical realization of this POVM is completely determined and it is shown that
after an inconclusive outcome, the input states may be mapped into a new set of

with less confidence than before. This leads us to introduce the concept of

strategy is iterated in as many stages as allowed by the input set, until no
further information can be extracted from an inconclusive result. Within each
stage of this measurement our confidence in identifying the input states is the
highest possible, although it decreases from one stage to the next. In
addition, the more stages we accomplish within the maximum allowed, the higher

al., Phys. Rev. B 80, 104405 (2009)] evidenced long-range magnetic order,
inconsistent with the previously suggested phenomenological magnetic model of
isolated dimers and spin chains. Based on extensive density-functional theory
band structure calculations, exact diagonalizations, quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, third-order perturbation theory, as well as high-field
magnetization measurements, we find that the magnetic properties of CdCu2(BO3)2
are accounted for by a frustrated quasi-2D magnetic model featuring four
inequivalent exchange couplings: the leading antiferromagnetic coupling J_d
within the structural Cu2O6 dimers, two interdimer couplings J_t1 and J_t2,
forming magnetic tetramers, and a ferromagnetic coupling J_it between the
tetramers. Based on comparison to the experimental data, we evaluate the ratios
of the leading couplings J_d : J_t1 : J_t2 : J_it = 1 : 0.20 : 0.45 : -0.30,
with J_d of about 178 K. The inequivalence of J_t1 and J_t2 largely lifts the
frustration and triggers long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. The proposed
model accounts correctly for the different magnetic moments localized on
structurally inequivalent Cu atoms in the ground-state magnetic configuration.
We extensively analyze the magnetic properties of this model, including a
detailed description of the magnetically ordered ground state and its evolution
in magnetic field with particular emphasis on the 1/2-magnetization plateau.
Our results establish remarkable analogies to the Shastry-Sutherland model of

problem in terms of induced polarization charges that act as a direct mapping
of the self-consistent continuum dielectric; this allows to define a functional
form for the dielectric that is well behaved both in the high-density region of
the nuclear charges and in the low-density region where the electronic
wavefunctions decay into the solvent. Second, we outline an iterative procedure
to solve the Poisson equation for the quantum fragment embedded in the solvent
that does not require multi-grid algorithms, is trivially parallel, and can be
applied to any Bravais crystallographic system. Last, we capture some of the
non-electrostatic or cavitation terms via a combined use of the quantum volume

The resulting self-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) model provides a very

realized in a two-dimensional network of quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor
wires that are proximity-coupled to a bulk superconductor. The wires should
have strong spin-orbit coupling with appropriate symmetry, and their electrons
should be partially polarized by a strong Zeeman field. Then, if the Fermi
level is in an appropriate range, the wire can be in a topological
superconducting phase, with Majorana states that occur at wire ends and at $Y$
junctions, where three topological superconductor segments may be joined. Here
we generalize these ideas to consider a three-dimensional network. The
positions of Majorana states can be manipulated, and their non-Abelian
properties made visible, by using external gates to selectively deplete
portions of the network, or by physically connecting and redividing wire
segments. Majorana states can also be manipulated by reorientations of the
Zeeman field on a wire segment, by physically rotating the wire about almost
any axis, or by evolution of the phase of the order parameter in the
proximity-coupled superconductor. We show how to keep track of sign changes in
the zero-energy Hilbert space during adiabatic manipulations by monitoring the
evolution of each Majorana state separately, rather than keeping track of the
braiding of all possible pairs. This has conceptual advantages in the case of a
three-dimensional network, and may be computationally useful even in two
dimensions, if large numbers of Majorana sites are involved.

stirring scenario for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The standard
procedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data and
thus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which are
usually subtle in low surface brightness systems. Taking advantage of the fact
that in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce
discrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the
Fourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of
simulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark
matter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. In addition to strong mass loss and
randomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation
that typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first
pericenter passage. These tidally induced bars persist for a few Gyr before
being shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strong
enough. We test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape of
nearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the Milky Way. We detect inner bars in
Ursa Minor, Sagittarius, LMC and possibly Carina. In addition, six out of
eleven studied dwarfs show elongated stellar distributions in the outer parts
that may signify transition to tidal tails. We thus find the shapes of Milky
Way satellites to be consistent with the predictions of the tidal stirring
model.

emission regions (R > a few hundred km); for this reason, it is referred to as
a `soft' excess. On the other hand, we recently found that in persistent,

emission from the NS polar caps. In this paper we present the results of a
recent XMM-Newton observation of the Galactic Be pulsar RX J0440.9+4431, which
is a poorly studied member of this class of sources. We have found a best-fit

is Lx ~ 8x10^(34) erg/s: this value is higher by a factor < 10 compared to
those obtained in the first source observations, but almost two orders of
magnitude lower than those measured during a few outbursts detected in the
latest years. The source spectrum can be described with a power law plus
blackbody model, with kTbb = 1.34(+/-0.04) keV and Rbb = 273(+/-16) m,

paper, we propose a wavenumber-dependent minimal complex shift parameter which
is predicted by a rigorous k-grid Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) of the multigrid

complex shift parameter provides the reader with a parameter choice that leads
to efficient Krylov convergence. Numerical experiments in one and two spatial

complex shift is both the minimal requirement for a multigrid V-cycle to
converge, as well as being near-optimal in terms of Krylov iteration count.

real trend to personalize mediation systems to improve user satisfaction. To
make these systems user sensitive, we propose a personalization platform called
2P-Med. 2P-Med allows personalizing any mediation system used in any domain
following a cyclic process. The process includes building and managing adequate
user profiles and sources profiles, content and quality matching, source
selection, adapting the mediator responses to user preferences and handling
user feedbacks. In this paper, we describe 2P-Med architecture and highlight
its main functionalities. We also illustrate the operation of the platform
through personalizing source selection in a travel planning assistant.

hot, X-ray emitting plasma at distances from the stellar surface beyond the the
X-ray bright corona and closed large-scale field, distances comparable to the
corotation radius. Mechanical equilibrium models have shown that dense
condensations, or ""slingshot prominences"", can rise to great heights due to
their density and temperatures cooler than their environs. On T Tauri stars,
however, we detect plasma at temperatures hotter than the ambient coronal
temperature. By previous model results, these loops should not reach the
inferred heights of tens of stellar radii where they likely no longer have the
support of the external field against magnetic tension. In this work, we
consider the effects of a stellar wind and show that indeed, hot loops that are
negatively buoyant can attain a mechanical equilibrium at heights above the
typical extent of the closed corona and the corotation radius.

binary phylogenetic trees on the same set of taxa X has a constant factor
polynomial-time approximation if and only if the problem of computing a
minimum-size feedback vertex set in a directed graph (DFVS) has a constant
factor polynomial-time approximation. The latter problem, which asks for a
minimum number of vertices to be removed from a directed graph to transform it
into a directed acyclic graph, is one of the problems in Karp's seminal 1972
list of 21 NP-complete problems. However, despite considerable attention from
the combinatorial optimization community it remains to this day unknown whether
a constant factor polynomial-time approximation exists for DFVS. Our result
thus places the (in)approximability of hybridization number in a much broader
complexity context, and as a consequence we obtain that hybridization number
inherits inapproximability results from the problem Vertex Cover. On the
positive side, we use results from the DFVS literature to give an O(log r log
log r) approximation for hybridization number, where r is the value of an
optimal solution to the hybridization number problem.

The crucial point of our approach is that the presence of detector's threshold
and calibration procedure have to be treated not as simply experimental
technicalities, but as the basic counterparts of the theoretical model. We call
this approach threshold signal detection model (TSD). The experiment on
coincidence detection which was done by Grangier in 1986 \cite{Grangier} played
a crucial role in rejection of (semi-)classical field models in favor of
quantum mechanics (QM): impossibility to resolve the wave-particle duality in
favor of a purely wave model. QM predicts that the relative probability of
coincidence detection, the coefficient $g^{(2)}(0),$ is zero (for one photon
states), but in (semi-)classical models $g^{(2)}(0)\geq 1.$ In TSD the
coefficient $g^{(2)}(0)$ decreases as $1/{\cal E}_d^2,$ where ${\cal E}_d>0$ is
the detection threshold. Hence, by increasing this threshold an experimenter
can make the coefficient $g^{(2)}(0)$ essentially less than 1. The
TSD-prediction can be tested experimentally in new Grangier type experiments
presenting a detailed monitoring of dependence of the coefficient $g^{(2)}(0)$
on the detection threshold.

  Mechanics","208 pages, 41 figures",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The research presented in this thesis was motivated by the need to improve
introductory physics courses. Introductory physics courses are generally the
first courses in which students learn to create models to solve complex
problems. However, many students taking introductory physics courses fail to
acquire a command of the concepts, methods and tools presented in these
courses. The reforms proposed by this thesis focus on altering the content of
introductory courses rather than content delivery methods as most reforms do.
  This thesis explores how the performance on a widely used test of conceptual
understanding in mechanics compares between students taking a course with
updated and modified content and students taking a traditional course. Better
performance by traditional students was found to stem from their additional
practice on the types of items which appeared on the test. The results of this
work brought into question the role of the introductory physics course for
non-majors.
  One aspect of this new role is the teaching of new methods such as
computation (the use of a computer to solve numerically, simulate and visualize
physical problems). This thesis explores the potential benefits for students
who learn computation as part of physics course. After students worked through
a suite of computational homework problems, many were able to model a new
physical situation with which they had no experience.
  The failure of some students to model this new situation might have stemmed
from their unfavorable attitudes towards learning computation. In this thesis,
we present the development of a new tool for characterizing students'
attitudes. Preliminary measurements indicated significant differences between
successful and unsuccessful students.

capable of inducing phase-coherent chaotic oscillations in both types of
networks, thereby enhancing the spatiotemporal complexity even in the presence
of 50% of symmetric disorders of both fixed and random types. Furthermore, the
coupling delay increases the robustness of the networks up to 70% of disorders,
thereby preventing the network from acquiring periodic oscillations to foster
disorder-induced spatiotemporal order. We also confirm the enhancement of
coherent chaotic oscillations using snapshots of the phases and values of the
associated Kuramoto order parameter. We also explain a possible mechanism for
the phenomenon of delay-induced coherent chaotic oscillations despite the
presence of large disorders and discuss its applications.
