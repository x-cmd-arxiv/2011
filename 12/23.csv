that the bottoms of the 1D minibands in both wires almost coincide with the

2) the experimentally observed temperature dependence $T^{-0.77}$ of the drag

(MCO) framework for intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). The approach
allows one to simultaneously explore the trade-off between different objectives
as well as the trade-off between robustness and nominal plan quality. In MCO, a
database of plans each emphasizing different treatment planning objectives, is
pre-computed to approximate the Pareto surface. An IMPT treatment plan that
strikes the best balance between the different objectives can be selected by
navigating on the Pareto surface. In our approach, robustness is integrated
into MCO by adding robustified objectives and constraints to the MCO problem.
Uncertainties of the robust problem are modeled by pre-calculated
dose-influence matrices for a nominal scenario and a number of pre-defined
error scenarios. A robustified objective represents the worst objective
function value that can be realized for any of the error scenarios. The
optimization method is based on a linear projection solver and is capable of
handling large problem sizes resulting from a fine dose grid resolution, many
scenarios, and a large number of proton pencil beams. A base-of-skull case is
used to demonstrate the robust optimization method. It is demonstrated that the
robust optimizationmethod reduces the sensitivity of the treatment plan to
setup and range errors to a degree that is not achieved by a safety margin
approach. A chordoma case is analyzed in more detail to demonstrate the
involved tradeoffs between target underdose and brainstem sparing as well as
robustness and nominal plan quality. The latter illustrates the advantage of
MCO in the context of robust planning. For all cases examined, the robust
optimization for each Pareto optimal plan takes less than 5 min on a standard
computer, making a computationally friendly interface possible to the planner.

address a number of open questions regarding BPS black holes in five

decomposes into the 4D Weyl multiplet and an extra Kaluza-Klein vector
multiplet. The emergence of the pseudoscalar field of the latter multiplet and

The reduction scheme enables to determine how a 5D supersymmetric Lagrangian

variety of independent 4D supersymmetric invariants, without the need for
imposing field equations. In this way we establish, for example, the existence
of a new N=2 supersymmetric invariant that involves the square of the Ricci

gap vary continuously with x, any band gap in between that of the pure AC and

that the respective ratio is miscible and thermodynamically stable. In most
cases the band gap does not vary linearly with x, but a pronounced bowing
behavior as a function of the concentration is observed. In this paper we show
that the electronic properties of such A(x)B(1-x)C semiconductors and, in

  We show how to apply logic program specialization to make sampling-based
inference more efficient. We develop an algorithm that specializes the
definitions of the query predicates with respect to the static part of the
knowledge base. In experiments on real-world data we obtain speedups of up to
an order of magnitude, and these speedups grow with the data-size.

expansions and contractions of the springs we observe a reptation of the chain.
We account for the average reptation velocity theoretically. The velocity of

Due to elastic e ects, there exists a critical amplitude below which the
reptation is expected to cease. However, rather than a full stop of the creep,
we observe in numerical simulations a transition between a continuous-creep and
an irregular-creep regime when the critical amplitude is approached. The latter
transition is reminiscent of the transition between the continuous and the
irregular compaction of granular matter submitted to periodic temperature
changes.

breaking down to the standard model gauge group involves just one scale, in
contrast to the conventional SO(10) models which require two scales. Further,
the models we discuss possess a natural doublet-triplet splitting via the
missing partner mechanism without fine tuning. Such models involve
$560+\ov{560}$ pair of heavy Higgs fields along with a set of light fields. The
$560+\ov{560}$ are the simplest representations of SO(10) besides the
$126+\ov{126}$ which contain an excess of color triplets over $SU(2)_L$
doublets. We discuss several possibilities for realizing the missing partner
mechanism within these schemes. With the $126+\ov{126}$ multiplets, three
viable models are found with additional fields belonging to ${210 + 2 \times 10

$560+\ov{560}$, a unique possibility arises for the missing partner mechanism,
with additional ${2\times 10+ 320}$ fields. These models are developed in some
detail. It is shown that fully realistic fermion masses can arise in some
cases, while others can be made realistic by addition of vector--like
representations. Naturally large neutrino mixing angles, including sizable
$\theta_{13}$, can emerge in these models. The couplings of the $H_u(H_d)$

algorithms that have guaranteed generalization properties when working with
such good functions. Our framework unifies and generalizes the frameworks
proposed by [Balcan-Blum ICML 2006] and [Wang et al ICML 2007]. An attractive
feature of our framework is its adaptability to data - we do not promote a
fixed notion of goodness but rather let data dictate it. We show, by giving
theoretical guarantees that the goodness criterion best suited to a problem can
itself be learned which makes our approach applicable to a variety of domains
and problems. We propose a landmarking-based approach to obtaining a classifier
from such learned goodness criteria. We then provide a novel diversity based
heuristic to perform task-driven selection of landmark points instead of random
selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our goodness criteria learning
method as well as the landmark selection heuristic on a variety of
similarity-based learning datasets and benchmark UCI datasets on which our
method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.

should be able to identify this effect through a single measurement. Moreover,
if the experiment is repeated on N successive days, the division of the error

identification of the Moon effect even with a pendulum of poorer accuracy, say
of the order of a few percent. In spite of the fact that this effect appears

  Ultra-slow fall","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper proposes an alternative to the Foucault pendulum for detecting
various movements of rotation of the Earth. Calculations suggest that if the
duration of a ""free"" fall becomes longer the eastward deflection will be
amplified in proportion with the increased duration. Instead of 20 micrometers
for a one-meter fall, one can expect deflections more than 1,000 times larger
when the fall lasts a few minutes. The method proposed in this paper consists
in using the buoyancy of a (non viscous) liquid in order to work in reduced
gravity. Not surprisingly, as in many astronomical observations, the main
challenge is to minimize the level of ""noise"". Possible sources of noise are
discussed and remedies are proposed. In principle, the experiment should be
done in superfluid helium. However, a preliminary experiment done in water gave
encouraging results in spite of a fairly high level of noise. In forthcoming
experiments the main objective will be to identify and eliminate the main
sources of noise. This experiment differs from the Foucault pendulum by its
greater flexibility. By adequately selecting the major parameters, e.g.
duration of the fall, viscosity of the fluid, size of the falling body, one can
change the deflection target. It is hoped that the present paper will encourage
new experiments in this direction.

allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a

Here, we address this issue from an interesting theoretical point of view. We
conjecture that the sign problem observed in some of the simulations is related
to the so called Neuberger 0/0 problem, which arises in ordinary
non-supersymmetric lattice gauge theories, and prevents the realization of
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry on the lattice. After discussing why we
expect a sign problem in certain classes of supersymmetric lattice gauge

evaded by use of a non-compact parametrization of the gauge link fields.

it is found that only a small percentage of the observed radio frequency flux
density from these sources can be Doppler boosted. Without a highly directed,
Doppler boosted component that dominates the observed flux, radio sources found
in low-frequency finding surveys cannot be preferentially selected with small
jet viewing angles. The distribution of jet orientations will then follow the
sin$i$ curve associated with a random distribution, where only a very few
sources (~1%) will have the small viewing angles (<8 deg) required to explain
apparent superluminal motions v{app > 10c, and this makes it difficult to
explain how around 33% of the radio-loud AGNs with high redshift can exhibit
such highly superluminal motions. When the boosted component is the dominant
one it can be argued that in a flux limited sample only those members with
small viewing angles would be picked up while those with larger viewing angles
(the un-boosted ones) would be missed. However, this is not the case when the

Hessian matrix of the least-squares cost function which typically span many

limit cycle, whereas only a few directions are stiff. With this study we show
that separating the time scales in the van der Pol system leads to a further
separation of eigenvalues. Parameter combinations which perturb the slow

quantum state. While such long wavelength physics is under control for massive
fields near the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state, such initial states make unnatural
assumptions about initial data outside the region of causal contact of a local
observer. We argue that a reasonable approximation to a maximum entropy state,
one that makes minimal assumptions outside an observer's horizon volume, is one
where a cutoff is placed on a surface bounded by timelike geodesics, just
outside the horizon. For sufficiently early times, such a cutoff induces
secular logarithmic divergences with the expansion of the region. For massive
fields, these effects sum to finite corrections at sufficiently late times. The
difference between the cutoff correlators and Hartle-Hawking correlators
provides a measure of the theoretical uncertainty due to lack of knowledge of
the initial state in causally disconnected regions. These differences are
negligible for primordial inflation, but can become significant during epochs
with very long-lived de Sitter regions, such as we may be entering now.

by scattering of spacecraft nucleons from dark matter gravitationally bound to
the earth, with the addition of data from five new flybys to that from the
original six. We continue to use our model in which inelastic and elastic
scatterers populate shells generated by the precession of circular orbits with
normals tilted with respect to the earth's axis. With 11 data points and 8
parameters in the model, a statistically meaningful fit is obtained with a
chi-squared of 2.7. We give plots of the anomalous acceleration along the
spacecraft trajectory, and the cumulative velocity change, for the five flybys
which exhibit a significant nonzero anomaly. We also discuss implications of
the fit for dark matter-nucleon cross sections, give the prediction of our fit
for the anomaly to be expected from the future Juno flyby, and give predictions
of our fit for flyby orbit orientation changes. In addition we give formulas
for estimating the flyby temperature increase caused by dark matter inelastic
scattering, and for the fraction of flyby nucleons undergoing such scatters.
Finally, for circular satellite orbits, we give a table of predicted secular
changes in orbit radius. These are much too large to be reasonable -- comparing
with data for COBE and GP-B supplied to us by Edward Wright (after the first
version of this paper was posted), we find that our model predicts changes in
orbit radius that are too large by many orders of magnitude. So the model
studied here is ruled out. We conclude that further modeling of the flyby
anomalies must simultaneously attempt to fit constraints coming from satellite
orbits.

when a low-mass planet (for example a super-Earth), encounters outgoing density
waves excited by another source in the disc. This source could be a gas giant
in an orbit interior to that of the low-mass planet. As the super-Earth passes
through the wave field, angular momentum is transferred to the disc material
and then communicated to the planet through coorbital dynamics, with the
consequence that its inward migration can be halted or even reversed. We
illustrate how the mechanism we consider works in a variety of different
physical conditions employing global two-dimensional hydrodynamical
calculations. We confirm our results by performing local shearing box
simulations in which the super-Earth interacts with density waves excited by an
independent harmonically varying potential. Finally, we discuss the constraints

(ISM) has been quantified using a pixel-by-pixel correlation of images of
continuum emission with a proxy for column density. We used three BLAST bands
at 250, 350, and 500 \mu m and one IRAS at 100 \mu m. The proxy is the
near-infrared color excess, E(J-Ks), obtained from 2MASS. Based on observations
of stars, we show how well this color excess is correlated with the total
hydrogen column density for regions of moderate extinction. The ratio of
emission to column density, the emissivity, is then known from the
correlations, as a function of frequency. The spectral distribution of this
emissivity can be fit by a modified blackbody, whence the characteristic dust
temperature T and the desired opacity \sigma_e(1200) at 1200 GHz can be
obtained. We have analyzed 14 regions near the Galactic plane toward the Vela
molecular cloud, mostly selected to avoid regions of high column density (N_H >
10^{22} cm^-2) and small enough to ensure a uniform T. We find \sigma_e(1200)
is typically 2 to 4 x 10^{-25} cm^2/H and thus about 2 to 4 times larger than
the average value in the local high Galactic latitude diffuse atomic ISM. This
is strong evidence for grain evolution. There is a range in total power per H
nucleon absorbed (re-radiated) by the dust, reflecting changes in the
interstellar radiation field and/or the dust absorption opacity. These changes
affect the equilibrium T, which is typically 15 K, colder than at high
latitudes. Our analysis extends, to higher opacity and lower T, the trend of
increasing opacity with decreasing T that was found at high latitudes. The
recognition of changes in the emission opacity raises a cautionary flag because
all column densities deduced from dust emission maps, and the masses of compact
structures within them, depend inversely on the value adopted.

on w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the CMB,
supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the Hubble constant. Considering
each extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sum

Arches cluster - a young (~2 Myr), massive (~10,000 Solar Mass) starburst
cluster located near the Galactic center. This was accomplished using proper
motion measurements within the central region of the cluster, obtained with the
laser guide star adaptive optics system at Keck Observatory over a 3 year time
baseline (2006-2009). This uniform dataset results in proper motion
measurements that are improved by a factor ~5 over previous measurements from
heterogeneous instruments, yielding internal velocity dispersion estimates 0.15
+/- 0.01 mas/yr, which corresponds to 5.4 +/- 0.4 km/s at a distance of 8.4
kpc.
  Projecting a simple model for the cluster onto the sky to compare with our
proper motion dataset, in conjunction with surface density data, we estimate
the total present-day mass of the cluster to be 15,000 (+7400 -6000) Solar
masses. The mass in stars observed within a cylinder of radius R=0.4 pc is
found to be 9000 (+4000 -3500) Solar Masses at formal 3-sigma confidence. This
mass measurement is free from assumptions about the mass function of the
cluster, and thus may be used to check mass estimates from photometry and
simulation. When we conduct this check, we find that the present-day mass
function of the Arches cluster is likely either top-heavy or truncated at
low-mass, or both.
  Collateral benefits of our data and analysis include: 1. cluster membership
probabilities, which may be used to extract a clean cluster sample for future
photometric work; 2. a refined estimate of the bulk motion of the Arches
cluster with respect to the field, which we find to be 172 +/- 15 km/s, which
is slightly slower than suggested by previous VLT-Keck measurements; and 3. a
velocity dispersion estimate for the field itself, which is likely dominated by
the inner galactic bulge and the nuclear disk.

analysis of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatile secretion by the pituitary
gland. Whereas measurements in the cavernous sinus cumulate anatomical and
technical difficulties, LH levels can be easily assessed from jugular blood.
However, plasma levels result from a convolution process due to clearance
effects when LH enters the general circulation. Simultaneous measurements
comparing LH levels in the cavernous sinus and jugular blood have revealed
clear differences in the pulse shape, the amplitude and the baseline. Besides,
experimental sampling occurs at a relatively low frequency (typically every 10
min) with respect to LH highest frequency release (one pulse per hour) and the
resulting LH measurements are noised by both experimental and assay errors. As
a result, the pattern of plasma LH may be not so clearly pulsatile. Yet,
reliable information on the InterPulse Intervals (IPI) is a prerequisite to
study precisely the steroid feedback exerted on the pituitary level. Hence,
there is a real need for robust IPI detection algorithms. In this article, we
present an algorithm for the monitoring of LH pulse frequency, basing ourselves
both on the available endocrinological knowledge on LH pulse (shape and
duration with respect to the frequency regime) and synthetic LH data generated
by a simple model. We make use of synthetic data to make clear some basic
notions underlying our algorithmic choices. We focus on explaining how the
process of sampling affects drastically the original pattern of secretion, and
especially the amplitude of the detectable pulses. We then describe the
algorithm in details and perform it on different sets of both synthetic and
experimental LH time series. We further comment on how to diagnose possible
outliers from the series of IPIs which is the main output of the algorithm.

mass/h and a redshift range of z=0-2, while satisfying the associated
requirements of resolution and statistical control. When fitting to the

normalization and shape in comparison to previous studies that have limited
statistics in the upper end of the mass range. We show that the flattening of
the c-M relation with redshift is naturally expressed if c is viewed as a

of the c-\nu relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z=0-2,
while the amplitude varies by ~30% for massive clusters. This relation is,
however, not universal: Using a simulation suite covering the allowed wCDM

cosmological parameters are varied. At fixed mass, the c(M) distribution is
well-fit by a Gaussian with \sigma_c/c = 0.33, independent of the radius at

concentrations from strong lensing, weak lensing, galaxy kinematics, and X-ray

of the Einstein field equations of Petrov type N with twisting principal null
directions, the CR structures to describe the parameter space for a congruence
of such null vectors provide a very useful tool. A work of Hill, Lewandowski
and Nurowski has given a good foundation for this, reducing the field equations
to a set of differential equations for two functions, one real, one complex, of
three variables. Under the assumption of the existence of one Killing vector,
the (infinite-dimensional) classical symmetries of those equations are
determined and group-invariant solutions are considered. This results in a
single ODE of the third order which may easily be reduced to one of the second
order. A one-parameter class of power series solutions, g(w), of this
second-order equation is realized, holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin
and behaving asymptotically as a simple quadratic function plus lower-order
terms for large values of w, which constitutes new solutions of the twisting
type N problem. The solution found by Leroy, and also by Nurowski, is shown to
be a special case in this class. Cartan's method for determining equivalence of
CR manifolds is used to show that this class is indeed much more general.
  In addition, for a special choice of a parameter, this ODE may be integrated
once, to provide a first-order Abel equation. It can also determine new
solutions to the field equations although no general solution has yet been
found for it.

describing a quantum Hall fluid (QHF) at paired states fillings $\nu =%

established . That allowed us to add new evidence to the relationship between
noncommutativity and quantum Hall fluids\cite% {ncmanybody}. On the other hand,
the $m$-reduced CFT is equivalent to a system of two massless scalar bosons
with a magnetic boundary interaction as introduced by Callan et al., at the so
called ``magic''\ points. We are then able to describe, within such a
framework, the dissipative quantum mechanics of a particle confined to a plane
and subject to an external magnetic field normal to it. Here we develop such a
point of view by focusing on the case $m=2$ which corresponds to a quantum Hall
bilayer. The key role of a localized impurity which couples the two layers is
emphasized and the effect of noncommutativity in terms of generalized magnetic
translations (GMT) is fully exploited. As a result, general GMT operators are
introduced, in the form of a tensor product, which act on the QHF and defect
space respectively, and a comprehensive study of their rich structure is

central supermassive black hole performing simulations using the SPH code
GADGET-3 including radiative cooling and heating by the central X-ray source.
As found in earlier 1D studies, our 3D simulations show that the accretion mode
depends on the X-ray luminosity (L_X) for a fixed density at infinity and
accretion efficiency. In the low L_X limit, gas accretes in a stable,
spherically symmetric fashion. In the high L_X limit, the inner gas is
significantly heated up and expands, reducing the central mass inflow rate. The
expanding gas can turn into a strong enough outflow capable of expelling most
of the gas at larger radii. For some intermediate L_X, the accretion flow
becomes unstable developing prominent non-spherical features, the key reason
for which is thermal instability (TI) as shown by our analyses. Small
perturbations of the initially spherically symmetric accretion flow that is
heated by the intermediate L_X quickly grow to form cold and dense clumps
surrounded by overheated low density regions. The cold clumps continue their
inward motion forming filamentary structures; while the hot infalling gas slows
down because of buoyancy and can even start outflowing through the channels in
between the filaments. We found that the ratio between the mass inflow rates of
the cold and hot gas is a dynamical quantity depending on several factors:

content. This method separates messages into components suitable for both
lossless coding and 'lossy' or statistical coding techniques, compressing
complex objects by separately encoding signals and noise. This is demonstrated
by compressing the most significant bits of data exactly, since they are
typically redundant and compressible, and either fitting a maximally likely
noise function to the residual bits or compressing them using lossy methods.
Upon decompression, the significant bits are decoded and added to a noise
function, whether sampled from a noise model or decompressed from a lossy code.
This results in compressed data similar to the original. For many test images,
a two-part image code using JPEG2000 for lossy coding and PAQ8l for lossless
coding produces less mean-squared error than an equal length of JPEG2000.
Computer-generated images typically compress better using this method than
through direct lossy coding, as do many black and white photographs and most
color photographs at sufficiently high quality levels. Examples applying the
method to audio and video coding are also demonstrated. Since two-part codes
are efficient for both periodic and chaotic data, concatenations of roughly
similar objects may be encoded efficiently, which leads to improved inference.
Applications to artificial intelligence are demonstrated, showing that signals
using an economical lossless code have a critical level of redundancy which
leads to better description-based inference than signals which encode either
insufficient data or too much detail.

already known ones in the reference database to find/predict their most
probable execution patterns. Because of different patterns lengths, the Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) is utilized for such comparison; a statistical analysis is
then applied to DTWs' outcomes to select the most suitable candidates.
Moreover, under a hypothesis, another algorithm is proposed to classify
applications under similar CPU utilization patterns. Three widely used text
processing applications (WordCount, Distributed Grep, and Terasort) and another
application (Exim Mainlog parsing) are used to evaluate our hypothesis in
tweaking system parameters in executing similar applications. Results were very
promising and showed effectiveness of our approach on 5-node Map-Reduce

Because QAP is NP-hard, exact algorithms are intractable. Approximate
algorithms necessarily employ an accuracy/efficiency trade-off. We developed a
fast approximate quadratic assignment algorithm (FAQ). FAQ finds a local optima
in (worst case) time cubic in the number of vertices, similar to other
approximate QAP algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm is
faster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80% of the suite of QAP

and CAPS instruments at Saturn orbit insertion (SOI) in 2004 confirmed the
existence of the ring atmosphere and ionosphere. The source mechanism was
suggested to be primarily photolytic decomposition of water ice producing
neutral O2 and H2 (Johnson et al., 2006). Therefore, we predicted that there
would be seasonal variations in the ring atmosphere and ionosphere due to the
orientation of the ring plane to the sun (Tseng et al., 2010). The atoms and
molecules scattered out of the ring atmosphere by ion-molecule collisions are
an important source for the inner magnetosphere (Johnson et al., 2006; Martens
et al. 2008; Tseng et al., 2010 and 2011). This source competes with water
products from the Enceladus' plumes, which, although possibly variable, do not
appear to have a seasonal variability (Smith et al., 2010). Recently, we found
that the plasma density, composition and temperature in the region from 2.5 to
3.5 RS exhibited significant seasonal variation between 2004 and 2010 (Elrod et
al., 2011). Here we present a one-box ion chemistry model to explain the
complex and highly variable plasma environment observed by the CAPS instrument
on Cassini. We combine the water products from Enceladus with the molecules
scattered from a corrected ring atmosphere, in order to describe the temporal
changes in ion densities, composition and temperature detected by CAPS. We
found that the observed temporal variations are primarily seasonal, due to the
predicted seasonal variation in the ring atmosphere, and are consistent with a
compressed magnetosphere at SOI.

Einstein's general relativity: a free-falling frame with gravitational force
eliminated locally in a small spacetime region shows the existence of a
boundary level, below which gravity is absent and above which \textit{gravity
emerges as condensation effect of microscopic motions} within each such frame
and interrelates free-falling frames at different spacetime points. In this
picture, gravitational field as a mediator of different free-falling frames
shows a remarkable \textit{parallelism with an order parameter to specify
""degenerate vacua""} in different thermodynamic pure phases due to the
\textit{condensation effects} in phase transitions. As the physical basis of
general relativity is found in the universality of mass point motions due to
the constancy of [inertial $m$]/[gravitational $m$], the general relativistic

of swarming (when the ``old'' queen leaves with part of the colony) or
absconding (when the queen leaves with all the colony) and in defense against
intruders such as wasps or hornets. In this paper we describe a fairly
different clustering process which occurs at any temperature and independently
of any special stimulus or circumstance. As a matter of fact, this process is
about four times faster at 28 degree Celsius than at 15 degrees. Because of its
simplicity and low level of ``noise'' we think that this phenomenon can provide
a means for exploring the strength of inter-individual attraction between bees
or other living organisms. For instance, and at first sight fairly
surprisingly, our observations showed that this attraction does also exist
between bees belonging to different colonies. As this study is aimed at
providing a comparative perspective, we also describe a similar clustering

law earlier introduced by Lomnitz, to broaden the geophysical applications to
fluid-like materials including igneous rocks. This generalized law, however,
can be applied also to solid-like viscoelastic materials. We revisit the
Jeffreys-Lomnitz law of creep by allowing its power law exponent $\alpha$,
usually limited to the range [0,1] to all negative values. This is consistent
with the linear theory of viscoelasticity because the creep function still
remains a Bernstein function, that is positive with a completely monotonic
derivative, with a related spectrum of retardation times. The complete range
$\alpha \le 1$ yields a continuous transition from a Hooke elastic solid with
no creep ($\alpha \to -\infty$) to a Maxwell fluid with linear creep
($\alpha=1$) passing through the Lomnitz viscoelastic body with logarithmic
creep ($\alpha=0$), which separates solid-like from fluid-like behaviors.
Furthermore, we numerically compute the relaxation modulus and provide the
analytical expression of the spectrum of retardation times corresponding to the
Jeffreys-Lomnitz creep law extended to all $\alpha \le 1$.

most widespread approaches for the numerical study of multicomponent fluid
systems. Both methods have been successfully employed by several authors but,
despite their popularity, still remains unclear how to properly compare them
and how they perform on the same problem. Here we present a unified framework
for the direct (one-to-one) comparison of the multicomponent LBM against the
PFM. We provide analytical guidelines on how to compare the Shan-Chen (SC)
lattice Boltzmann model for non-ideal multicomponent fluids with a
corresponding free energy (FE) lattice Boltzmann model. Then, in order to
properly compare the LBM vs. the PFM, we propose a new formulation for the free
energy of the Cahn-Hilliard/Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, the LBM model is
numerically compared with the corresponding phase field model solved by means
of a pseudo-spectral algorithm. This work constitute a first attempt to set the
basis for a quantitative comparison between different algorithms for
multicomponent fluids. We limit our scope to the few of the most common
variants of the two most widespread methodologies, namely the lattice Boltzmann
model (SC and FE variants) and the Phase Field Model.

Rotation is known to affect the nucleosynthesis of light elements in
massive stars, mainly by rotation-induced mixing. In particular, rotation
boosts the primary nitrogen production. Models of rotating stars are able to
reproduce the nitrogen observed in low-Z halo stars. Aims. Here we present the
first grid of stellar models for rotating massive stars at low Z, where a full
s-process network is used to study the impact of rotation-induced mixing on the
nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Methods. We used the Geneva stellar
evolution code that includes an enlarged reaction network with nuclear species
up to bismuth to calculate 25 M$_\odot$ models at three different Z and with
different initial rotation rates. Results. First, we confirm that
rotation-induced mixing leads to a production of primary $^{22}$Ne, which is
the main neutron source for the s process in massive stars. Therefore rotation
boosts the s process in massive stars at all Z. Second, the neutron-to-seed
ratio increases with decreasing Z in models including rotation, which leads to
the complete consumption of all iron seeds at Z < 1e-3 by the end of core
He-burning. Thus at low Z, the iron seeds are the main limitation for this
boosted s process. Third, as Z decreases, the production of elements up to the
Ba peak increases at the expense of the elements of the Sr peak. We studied the
impact of the initial rotation rate and of the uncertain
$^{17}$O$(\alpha,\gamma)$ rate (which strongly affects the neutron poison
strength of $^{16}$O) on our results. This study shows that rotating models can
produce significant amounts of elements up to Ba over a wide range of Z.
Fourth, compared to the He-core, the primary $^{22}$Ne production in the
He-shell is even higher (> 1% in mass fraction at all Z), which could open the
door for an explosive neutron capture nucleosynthesis in the He-shell, with a
primary neutron source.

reduce their contacts with others in fear of getting infected. Such typical
actions apparently help slow down the spreading of infection. Thanks to today's
broad public media coverage, the fear factor may even contribute to prevent an
outbreak from happening. We are motivated to study such effects by adopting a
complex network approach. Firstly we evaluate the simple case where connections
between individuals are randomly removed due to fear factor. Then we consider a
different case where each individual keeps at least a few connections after
contact reduction. Such a case is arguably more realistic since people may
choose to keep a few social contacts, e.g., with their family members and
closest friends, at any cost. Finally a study is conducted on the case where
connection removals are carried out dynamically while the infection is
spreading out. Analytical and simulation results show that the fear factor may
not easily prevent an epidemic outbreak from happening in scale-free networks.
However, it significantly reduces the fraction of the nodes ever getting
infected during the outbreak.

uninformed, uniform prior distribution is an obvious alternative that avoids
the choice of a confidence level. In this paper, we demonstrate that in the
case of independent default events the upper confidence bounds can be
represented as quantiles of a Bayesian posterior distribution based on a prior
that is slightly more conservative than the uninformed prior. We then describe
how to implement the uninformed and conservative Bayesian estimators in the
dependent one- and multi-period default data cases and compare their estimates
to the upper confidence bound estimates. The comparison leads us to suggest a
constrained version of the uninformed (neutral) Bayesian estimator as an
alternative to the upper confidence bound estimators.

using a `lazy' transmission policy that chooses its transmission power to
minimize the transmission time assuming that no further energy arrivals are

described by an integral response model with a decay time scale of about 11

coefficients of the parameters with Rz (r0 = 0.830). If a double decay integral

is significantly distorted from the equilibrium one, since the production for
the modes with lower momenta $k \ll T$ ($T$ is the temperature of the universe)
is enhanced, while suppressed for higher modes. As a result, the most important
mode for the yields of sterile neutrinos as well as the baryon asymmetry is $k
\simeq 2 T$, which is smaller than < k > inferred from the thermal average. The
comparison with the previous works is also discussed.

These amplitudes are extracted using a model-dependent evaluation of the

the Cabibbo V-A theory and SU(3) symmetry are assumed to be valid. The nuclear
effects are included via the bound state wavefunctions of the nucleon obtained
from the relativistic mean field (RMF) models. Two kinematics settings are used
to examine various distributions of the differential cross section in the rest

neutrino-induced charged-current (CC) \,$\rm K^{^+}\Lambda$-production on bound
neutrons in $1s^{1/2}$ and $1p^{3/2}$ orbitals of $^{12}$C. The angular
distributions are forward peaked under both kinematic settings, whereas under
the quasifree setting the cross sections tend mimic the missing momentum

ground state. Building on this alternative approach to get 1/S corrections, we
provide the first semiclassical derivation of the momentum distribution, and we
revisit the calculation of the condensate density. The results of these as well
as other physically relevant quantities such as the superfluid density are
systematically compared to quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This comparison
shows that the logarithmic corrections in the dilute Bose gas limit are only
captured by the semi-classical approach if the 1/S corrections are properly
calculated, and that the semi-classical approach is able to reproduce the 1/k
divergence of the momentum distribution at k=0. Finally, the effect of 1/S^2
corrections is briefly discussed.

various sparsity patterns on the nVidia ""Fermi"" class of GPGPUs. A new ""padded
jagged diagonals storage"" (pJDS) format is proposed which may substantially
reduce the memory overhead intrinsic to the widespread ELLPACK-R scheme. In our
test scenarios the pJDS format cuts the overall spMVM memory footprint on the
GPGPU by up to 70%, and achieves 95% to 130% of the ELLPACK-R performance.
Using a suitable performance model we identify performance bottlenecks on the
node level that invalidate some types of matrix structures for efficient
multi-GPGPU parallelization. For appropriate sparsity patterns we extend
previous work on distributed-memory parallel spMVM to demonstrate a scalable
hybrid MPI-GPGPU code, achieving efficient overlap of communication and

solution to the radial OPF problem is presented and used to study the structure
of optimal inverter var injection and the net benefits, taking into account the
additional cost of inverter losses when operating at non-unity power factor.
This paper will illustrate how, depending on the circuit topology and its
loading condition, the inverter's optimal reactive power injection is not
necessarily monotone with respect to their real power output. The results are
demonstrated on a distribution feeder on the Southern California Edison system

in order to test internal SZ quality flags, and the pertinence of these flags
is discussed in light of the validation results. Ten of the candidates are
found to be bona fide clusters lying below the RASS flux limit. Redshift
estimates are available for all confirmed systems via X-ray Fe-line
spectroscopy. They lie in the redshift range 0.19<z<0.94, demonstrating
Planck's capability to detect clusters up to high z. The X-ray properties of
the new clusters appear to be similar to previous new detections by Planck at
lower z and higher SZ flux: the majority are X-ray underluminous for their
mass, estimated using Y_X as mass proxy, and many have a disturbed morphology.
We find tentative indication for Malmquist bias in the Y_SZ-Y_X relation, with
a turnover at Y_SZ \sim 4 e-4 arcmin^2. We present additional new optical
redshift determinations with ENO and ESO telescopes of candidates previously
confirmed with XMM-Newton. The X-ray and optical redshifts for a total of 20
clusters are found to be in excellent agreement. We also show that useful lower
limits can be put on cluster redshifts using X-ray data only via the use of the
Y_X vs. Y_SZ and X-ray flux F_X vs. Y_SZ relations.

decays of the differential transmission. To make predictions for future

process through which they integrate information, specially given the noisy

to display simple patterns of signal integration. Furthermore, our

approximations.

spatially coupled across a finite window along the chain direction. We
investigate their phase diagram at zero temperature using the survey
propagation formalism and the interpolation method. We prove that the SAT-UNSAT
phase transition threshold of an infinite chain is identical to the one of the
individual standard model, and is therefore not affected by spatial coupling.
We compute the survey propagation complexity using population dynamics as well
as large degree approximations, and determine the survey propagation threshold.
We find that a clustering phase survives coupling. However, as one increases
the range of the coupling window, the survey propagation threshold increases
and saturates towards the phase transition threshold. We also briefly discuss
other aspects of the problem. Namely, the condensation threshold is not
affected by coupling, but the dynamic threshold displays saturation towards the
condensation one. All these features may provide a new avenue for obtaining
better provable algorithmic lower bounds on phase transition thresholds of the
individual standard model.

knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem and an ability to perform the simplest
algebraic operations are sufficient to be conversant with the kinematics of the
special theory of relativity, as well as the time dilation and contraction of
the longitudinal dimensions of moving bodies that are associated with relative
motion. However, the simplicity of the fundamentals of the theory of relativity
are in surprising contrast with the difficulty of the perception and at times
the total nonacceptance of the consequences of the special theory of relativity
by skeptics based on ordinary common sense. The authors of certain popular
books on the theory of relativity explain the existence of this contrast by way
of the fact that the common sense of skeptics cut its teeth on a ""stark notion
of our everyday life"". The special theory of relativity is simulated in this
article based on the simplest examples of the movement of barges, shuttles, and
boats in an aquatic environment. It has been simulated without rejecting the
customary ordinary common sense. In this article, relativistic time and the
relativistic effects of Einstein's special theory of relativity - Lorentz
contraction, time dilation, relativistic Doppler effects, the Skobeltsyn-Bell
effect, and the relativistic addition of velocities - are simulated using
elementary methods of classical physics. They have been simulated without
rejecting the customary ordinary common sense that was squashed in the past
century by the celebration of ""mad ideas"". Lorentz transformations are
obtained. Means for simulating four-dimensional space-time are shown.
