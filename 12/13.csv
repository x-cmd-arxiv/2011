method which is a mathematically rigorous simultaneous application of both the
mode-by-mode summation technique and scattering formalism. The contributions to
the Casimir energy of electromagnetic excitations of different types (surface
modes, waveguide modes, and photonic modes) are clearly retraced. A correct
transition to imaginary frequencies is accomplished with allowance for all the
peculiarities of the frequency equations and pertinent scattering data in the
complex $\omega $ plane, including, in particular, the cuts connecting the
branch points and complex roots of the frequency equations (quasi-normal
modes). The principal novelty of our approach is a special choice of
appropriate passes in the contour integrals, which are used for transition to
imaginary frequencies. As a result, the long standing problem of cuts in the
complex $\omega $ plane is solved completely. Inconsistencies of some previous
derivations of the Lifshitz formula are traced briefly. For completeness of the
presentation, the necessary mathematical facts are also stated, namely,
solution of the Maxwell equations for configurations under consideration,
scattering formalism for parallel plane interfaces, determination of the
frequency equation roots, and others.

$\mu$SR indicates that at pressures $p\geq0.8$\,GPa static magnetic order
occurs in FeSe$_{1-x}$ and occupies the full sample volume for $p\gtrsim

simultaneously, and both superconductivity and magnetism are stabilized with
increasing pressure. Calculations indicate only one possible muon stopping site
in FeSe$_{1-x}$, located on the line connecting the Se atoms along the
$c$-direction. Different magnetic structures are proposed and checked by
combining the muon stopping calculations with a symmetry analysis, leading to a
similar structure as in the LaFeAsO family of Fe-based superconductors.
Furthermore, it is shown that the magnetic moment is pressure dependent and
with a rather small value of $\mu\approx 0.2\,\mu_B$ at $p\simeq2.4$\,GPa.

access data only through authorized views defined by annotating an XML grammar
(e.g. DTD) with a collection of XPath expressions. To prevent improper
disclosure of confidential information, user queries posed on these views need
to be rewritten into equivalent queries on the underlying documents. This
rewriting enables us to avoid the overhead of view materialization and
maintenance. A major concern here is that query rewriting for recursive XML
views is still an open problem. To overcome this problem, some works have been
proposed to translate XPath queries into non-standard ones, called Regular
XPath queries. However, query rewriting under Regular XPath can be of
exponential size as it relies on automaton model. Most importantly, Regular
XPath remains a theoretical achievement. Indeed, it is not commonly used in
practice as translation and evaluation tools are not available. In this paper,
we show that query rewriting is always possible for recursive XML views using
only the expressive power of the standard XPath. We investigate the extension
of the downward class of XPath, composed only by child and descendant axes,
with some axes and operators and we propose a general approach to rewrite
queries under recursive XML views. Unlike Regular XPath-based works, we provide
a rewriting algorithm which processes the query only over the annotated DTD
grammar and which can run in linear time in the size of the query. An
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm is efficient and scales
well.

hash table (or DHT, in short) overlay networks. We present ViP2P (standing for
Views in Peer-to-Peer), a distributed platform for sharing XML documents based
on a structured P2P network infrastructure (DHT). At the core of ViP2P stand
distributed materialized XML views, defined by arbitrary XML queries, filled in
with data published anywhere in the network, and exploited to efficiently
answer queries issued by any network peer. ViP2P allows user queries to be
evaluated over XML documents published by peers in two modes. First, a
long-running subscription mode, when a query can be registered in the system
and receive answers incrementally when and if published data matches the query.
Second, queries can also be asked in an ad-hoc, snapshot mode, where results
are required immediately and must be computed based on the results of other
long-running, subscription queries. ViP2P innovates over other similar
DHT-based XML sharing platforms by using a very expressive structured XML query
language. This expressivity leads to a very flexible distribution of XML
content in the ViP2P network, and to efficient snapshot query execution. ViP2P
has been tested in real deployments of hundreds of computers. We present the
platform architecture, its internal algorithms, and demonstrate its efficiency
and scalability through a set of experiments. Our experimental results outgrow
by orders of magnitude similar competitor systems in terms of data volumes,

The remaining three pulsars (reported here for the first time) were not
detected enough to establish solutions. We also report our timing solutions for
five pulsars with previously published solutions, and find good agreement with
past authors, except for PSR J1701-3006B in M62. Gas in this system is probably
responsible for the discrepancy in orbital parameters, and we have been able to
measure a change in the orbital period over the course of our observations.
Among the pulsars with new solutions we find several binary pulsars with very
low mass companions (members of the so-called ""black widow"" class) and we are
able to place constraints on the mass-to-light ratio in two clusters. We
confirm that one of the pulsars in NGC 6624 is indeed a member of the rare
class of non-recycled pulsars found in globular clusters. We also have measured
the orbital precession and Shapiro delay for a relativistic binary in NGC 6544.
If we assume that the orbital precession can be described entirely by general
relativity, which is likely, we are able to measure the total system mass
(2.57190(73) M_sun) and companion mass (1.2064(20) M_sun), from which we derive
the orbital inclination [sin(i) = 0.9956(14)] and the pulsar mass (1.3655(21)

in biostatistics. Recently, the method of higher criticism (HC) was shown to be
an effective means for determining appropriate decision thresholds. Here, we
study HC from a false discovery rate (FDR) perspective. We show that the HC
threshold may be viewed as an approximation to a natural class boundary (CB) in
two-class discriminant analysis which in turn is expressible as FDR threshold.
We demonstrate that in a rare-weak setting in the region of the phase space
where signal identification is possible both thresholds are practicably
indistinguishable, and thus HC thresholding is identical to using a simple
local FDR cutoff. The relationship of the HC and CB thresholds and their
properties are investigated both analytically and by simulations, and are
further compared by application to four cancer gene expression data sets.

underlying statistical mechanics is controlled by the same waiting time
distribution, rescaled by an exponential decay measured by the free energy

by Schoenmakers (2010), Bender (2011a), Bender (2011b), Aleksandrov and Hambly
(2010), and Meinshausen and Hambly (2004) on multiple exercise options, which
either take into consideration a refraction period or volume constraints, but
not both simultaneously. We also allow more flexible cashflow structures than
the additive structure in the above references. For example some exponential
utility problems are covered by our setting. We supplement the theoretical
results with an explicit Monte Carlo algorithm for constructing confidence
intervals for the price of multiple exercise options and exemplify it by a
numerical study on the pricing of a swing option in an electricity market.

classification performance, with different origins and niches of application:
accuracy, macro-accuracy, area under the ROC curve, the ROC convex hull, the
absolute error, and the Brier score (with its decomposition into refinement and
calibration). One way of understanding the relation among some of these metrics
is the use of variable operating conditions (either in the form of
misclassification costs or class proportions). Thus, a metric may correspond to
some expected loss over a range of operating conditions. One dimension for the
analysis has been precisely the distribution we take for this range of
operating conditions, leading to some important connections in the area of
proper scoring rules. However, we show that there is another dimension which
has not received attention in the analysis of performance metrics. This new
dimension is given by the decision rule, which is typically implemented as a
threshold choice method when using scoring models. In this paper, we explore
many old and new threshold choice methods: fixed, score-uniform, score-driven,
rate-driven and optimal, among others. By calculating the loss of these methods
for a uniform range of operating conditions we get the 0-1 loss, the absolute
error, the Brier score (mean squared error), the AUC and the refinement loss
respectively. This provides a comprehensive view of performance metrics as well
as a systematic approach to loss minimisation, namely: take a model, apply
several threshold choice methods consistent with the information which is (and
will be) available about the operating condition, and compare their expected
losses. In order to assist in this procedure we also derive several connections
between the aforementioned performance metrics, and we highlight the role of
calibration in choosing the threshold choice method.

limitations posed by Gaussian cluster states, which are known not to be
universal for quantum computations of unbounded length, unless one is willing
to scale the degree of squeezing with the total system size. We establish a
framework derived from tensor networks and matrix product states with infinite
physical dimension and finite auxiliary dimension general enough to provide a
framework for such schemes. Since in the discussed schemes the logical encoding
is finite-dimensional, tools of error correction are applicable. We also

pixel-z method. The systematics studied include the effect of the input stellar
population synthesis model, passband limitations and differences between
individual SED fits to pixels and global SED-fitting to a galaxy's colors. We
find that with optical-only colors, the systematic errors due to differences
among the models are well constrained. The largest impact on the age and SFR
e-folding time estimates in the pixels arises from differences between the
Maraston models and the Bruzual&Charlot models, when optical colors are used.
This results in systematic differences larger than the 2{\sigma} uncertainties
in over 10 percent of all pixels in the galaxy sample. The effect of
restricting the available passbands is more severe. In 26 percent of pixels in
the full sample, passband limitations result in systematic biases in the age
estimates which are larger than the 2{\sigma} uncertainties. Systematic effects
from model differences are reexamined using Near-IR colors for a subsample of
46 galaxies in the GOODS-NICMOS survey. For z > 1, the observed optical/NIR
colors span the rest frame UV-optical SED, and the use of different models does
not significantly bias the estimates of the stellar population parameters
compared to using optical-only colors. We then illustrate how pixel-z can be
applied robustly to make detailed studies of substructure in high redshift
galaxies such as (a) radial gradients of age, SFR, sSFR and dust and (b) the
distribution of these properties within subcomponents such as spiral arms and
clumps. Finally, we show preliminary results from the CANDELS survey

values for the Higgs mass, $m_H=126.0\pm 3.5$ GeV, where the error is mostly
due to the theoretical uncertainty of the 2-loop RGE. This prediction could be
soon tested at the Large Hadron Collider. Our inflationary scenario could also
be further checked by better constraining the spectral index and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio.

turbulent. A phenomenological approach is adopted to describe the turbulence,
in which not only the effective surface density but the velocity dispersion of
the gaseous component are both scale-dependent as power-law functions of the
wavenumber of the perturbations. Also, the stellar component which has
gravitational interaction with the gas is considered as a fluid. We calculate
growth rate of the perturbations and in the most of the studied cases, the
stability of the disc highly depends on the existence of the stars and the

that the conventional gas and star threshold is not adequate for analyzing

and resistive advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). The importance of
thermal conduction on hot accretion flow is confirmed by observations of hot
gas that surrounds Sgr A$^*$ and a few other nearby galactic nuclei. In this
research, thermal conduction is studied by a saturated form of it, as is
appropriated for weakly-collisional systems. It is assumed the viscosity and
the magnetic diffusivity are due to turbulence and dissipation in the flow. The
viscosity also is due to angular momentum transport. Here, the magnetic
diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity are not constant and vary by position
and $\alpha$-prescription is used for them. The govern equations on system have
been solved by the steady self-similar method. The solutions show the radial
velocity is highly subsonic and the rotational velocity behaves sub-Keplerian.
The rotational velocity for a specific value of the thermal conduction
coefficient becomes zero. This amount of conductivity strongly depends on
magnetic pressure fraction, magnetic Prandtl number, and viscosity parameter.
Comparison of energy transport by thermal conduction with the other energy
mechanisms implies that thermal conduction can be a significant energy
mechanism in resistive and magnetized ADAFs. This property is confirmed by
non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations.

PRISM, Poole's ICL, Raedt et al's ProbLog and Vennekens et al's LPAD, is aimed
at combining statistical and logical knowledge representation and inference. A
key characteristic of PLP frameworks is that they are conservative extensions
to non-probabilistic logic programs which have been widely used for knowledge
representation. PLP frameworks extend traditional logic programming semantics
to a distribution semantics, where the semantics of a probabilistic logic
program is given in terms of a distribution over possible models of the
program. However, the inference techniques used in these works rely on
enumerating sets of explanations for a query answer. Consequently, these
languages permit very limited use of random variables with continuous
distributions. In this paper, we present a symbolic inference procedure that
uses constraints and represents sets of explanations without enumeration. This
permits us to reason over PLPs with Gaussian or Gamma-distributed random
variables (in addition to discrete-valued random variables) and linear equality
constraints over reals. We develop the inference procedure in the context of
PRISM; however the procedure's core ideas can be easily applied to other PLP
languages as well. An interesting aspect of our inference procedure is that
PRISM's query evaluation process becomes a special case in the absence of any
continuous random variables in the program. The symbolic inference procedure
enables us to reason over complex probabilistic models such as Kalman filters
and a large subclass of Hybrid Bayesian networks that were hitherto not
possible in PLP frameworks. (To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic

distribution-based penalized inference to AR models, which is especially useful
when the other estimation methods fail or under perform for AR processes with
heavy-tailed innovations (see \cite{Resnick}). A simulation study confirms our
theoretical results. At the end, we apply our method to a historical price data

predictions. Our BBN calculations include updates of nuclear rates in light of
recent experimental and theoretical information, with the most significant
change occuring for the d(p,gamma)^3He cross section. We calculate a likelihood
function for BBN theory and observations that accounts for both observational
errors and nuclear rate uncertainties and can be easily embedded in
cosmological parameter fitting. We then demonstrate that CMB and BBN are in
good agreement, suggesting that the number of relativistic species did not
change between the time of BBN and the time of recombination. The level of
agreement between BBN and CMB, as well as the agreement with the standard model
of particle physics, depends somewhat on systematic differences among
determinations of the primordial helium abundance. We demonstrate that
interesting constraints can be derived combining only CMB and D/H observations
with BBN theory, suggesting that an improved D/H constraint would be an
extremely valuable probe of cosmology.

overdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of a
galaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. A comparison to a large
{\Lambda}CDM simulation suggests that the system may consist of merging
subclusters, with properties in between those of z > 2 protoclusters with more
diffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusters
with prominent red sequences. The structure is completely absent in public

in the electric repulsion between colliding particles. Depending on its charge
state, dust material may have the potential to control key processes towards
planet formation such as MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) turbulence and grain growth
which are coupled in a two-way process. We quantify the grain charging at
different stages of disc evolution and differentiate between two very extreme
cases: compact spherical grains and aggregates with fractal dimension D_f = 2.
Applying a simple chemical network that accounts for collisional charging of
grains, we provide a semi-analytical solution. This allowed us to calculate the
equilibrium population of grain charges and the ionisation fraction
efficiently. The grain charging was evaluated for different dynamical
environments ranging from static to non-stationary disc configurations. The
results show that the adsorption/desorption of neutral gas-phase heavy metals,
such as magnesium, effects the charging state of grains. The greater the
difference between the thermal velocities of the metal and the dominant
molecular ion, the greater the change in the mean grain charge. Agglomerates
have more negative excess charge on average than compact spherical particles of
the same mass. The rise in the mean grain charge is proportional to N**(1/6) in
the ion-dust limit. We find that grain charging in a non-stationary disc
environment is expected to lead to similar results. The results indicate that
the dust growth and settling in regions where the dust growth is limited by the
so-called ""electro-static barrier"" do not prevent the dust material from
remaining the dominant charge carrier.

obstacles, since it requires high frequency measurements. Moreover, quantum
fluctuations are normally dominated by classical noise, and are usually further
obstructed by various accompanying effects such as a detector backaction. In
present work, we demonstrate that these difficulties can be bypassed by
performing the cross-correlation measurements. We propose to use a pair of
two-level detectors, weakly coupled to a collective mode of an electric
circuit. Fluctuations of the current source accumulated in the collective mode
induce stochastic transitions in the detectors. These transitions are then read
off by quantum point contact (QPC) electrometers and translated into two
telegraph processes in the QPC currents. Since both detectors interact with the
same collective mode, this leads to a certain fraction of the correlated
transitions. These correlated transitions are fingerprinted in the
cross-correlations of the telegraph processes, which can be detected at zero
frequency, i.e., with a long time measurements. Concerning the dependance of
the cross-correlator on the detectors' energy splittings, the most interesting
region is at the degeneracy points, where it exhibits a sharp non-local
resonance, that stems from higher order processes. We find that at certain
conditions the main contribution to this resonance comes from the quantum
noise. Namely, while the resonance line shape is weakly broadened by the
classical noise, the height of the peak is directly proportional to the square
of the quantum component of the noise spectral function.

hole spacetime possesses a branch cut on the complex frequency plane.
Classically, the branch cut is important, for example, in order to fully
determine the response of the black hole to a linear field perturbation. The
branch cut is also useful for the calculation of the self-force on a point
particle moving in the Schwarzschild background. In this paper we use
techniques of analytic-continuation to the complex plane of the radial
coordinate in order to calculate the branch cut contribution to the Green
function in the limit of large imaginary frequency. It is expected that the
contribution of this frequency regime to the perturbation response and to the
self-force will be mostly for short time intervals. We also determine the
highly-damped quasinormal mode frequencies for electromagnetic perturbations in
Schwarzschild for the first time (previously only the leading imaginary part
was known), which seem to have a 'deep connection' with the branch cut. We find
that these frequencies behave like $\omega_{\ell,n}=
-\dfrac{in}{2}-\dfrac{i[\ell(\ell+1)]^2}{2n}+\dfrac{\pi^{1/2}(1-i)[\ell(\ell+1)]^3}{2^{3/2}n^{3/2}}+O(n^{-2})$.

of quantum gravity in that they are believed to probe the small scale structure

planets in systems with multiple transiting planets through photometry alone.
Our method is highly model independent, making no assumptions about the stellar
parameters and requiring no radial velocity, transit timing or occultation
events. Our technique exploits the fact the light curve derived stellar density
must be the same for all planets transiting a common star. Assuming a circular
orbit, the derived stellar density departs from the true value by a predictable
factor, Psi, which contains information on the eccentricity of the system. By
comparing multiple stellar densities, any differences must be due to
eccentricity and thus meaningful constraints can be placed in the absence of
any other information. The technique, dubbed ""Multibody Asterodensity
Profiling"" (MAP), is a new observable which can be used alone or in combination
with other observables, such as radial velocities and transit timing
variations. An eccentricity prior can also be included as desired. MAP is most
sensitive to the minimum pair-combined eccentricity e.g. (e1 + e2)[min].
Individual eccentricity constraints are less stringent but an empirical
eccentricity posterior is always derivable and is freely available from transit
photometry alone. We present a description of our technique using both analytic
and numerical implementations, followed by two example analyses on synthetic
photometry as a proof of principle. We point out that MAP has the potential to
constrain the eccentricity, and thus habitability, of Earth-like planets in the
absence of radial velocity data, which is likely for terrestrial-mass objects.

core cluster, resolving the flow from Mpc scales down to pc scales. We do not
(yet) include any AGN heating, focusing instead on cooling in order to
understand how gas gets to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of
the cluster. We find that, as the gas cools, the cluster develops a very flat
temperature profile, undergoing a cooling catastrophe only in the central
10-100 pc of the cluster. Outside of this region, the flow is smooth, with no
local cooling instabilities, and naturally produces very little low-temperature
gas (below a few keV), in agreement with observations. The gas cooling in the
center of the cluster rapidly forms a thin accretion disk. The amount of cold
gas produced at the very center grows rapidly until a reasonable estimate of
the resulting AGN heating rate (assuming even a moderate accretion efficiency)
would overwhelm cooling. We argue that this naturally produces a thermostat
which links the cooling of gas out to 100 kpc with the cold gas accretion in
the central 100 pc, potentially closing the loop between cooling and heating.
Isotropic heat conduction does not affect the result significantly, but we show
that including the potential well of the brightest cluster galaxy is necessary
to obtain the correct result. Also, we found that the outcome is sensitive to
resolution, requiring very high mass resolution to correctly reproduce the
small transition radius.

variety of weak-scale supersymmetric models. A Higgs mass of this size strongly
points towards a non-minimal implementation of supersymmetry. The Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model now requires large A-terms to avoid multi-TeV
stops. The fine-tuning is at least 1% for low messenger scales, and an order of
magnitude worse for high messenger scales. Naturalness is significantly
improved in theories with a singlet superfield S coupled to the Higgs
superfields via \lambda\ S H_u H_d. If \lambda\ is perturbative up to unified
scales, a fine-tuning of about 10% is possible with a low mediation scale.
Larger values of \lambda, implying new strong interactions below unified
scales, allow for a highly natural 125 GeV Higgs boson over a wide range of
parameters. Even for \lambda\ as large as 2, where a heavier Higgs might be
expected, a light Higgs boson naturally results from singlet-doublet scalar
mixing. Although the Higgs is light, naturalness allows for stops as heavy as
1.5 TeV and a gluino as heavy as 3 TeV. Non-decoupling effects among the Higgs
doublets can significantly suppress the coupling of the light Higgs to b quarks

conventional WIMP models, is obtained with only order one couplings and
TeV-scale masses according to the WIMP miracle. Thus, WIMPy baryogenesis models
naturally accommodate weak-scale dark matter. Furthermore, an extension of the
WIMP miracle simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry and the
correct dark matter abundance. The models we present have the further feature
that they create the baryon number asymmetry at the weak scale, thereby
avoiding the problems in some models of baryogenesis associated with high
reheat temperatures in supersymmetric theories. Some of these models yield
observable consequences in ongoing and future experiments.

ultra-red colors (g-i=1.49+-0.01 mags). The orbit of the mutual components was
found to have a period of 961.2+-4.6 days with a semi-major axis of 21000+-160

the mirror orbit rejected at high confidence. The total system mass is
7.90+-0.21 x 10^17 kg. Equal-sized, wide binaries and ultra-red colors are
common in the low inclination ""cold"" classical part of the Kuiper Belt and
likely formed through some sort of three body interactions within a much denser

outside of the classical Kuiper belt. Numerical simulations suggest 2007 TY430
is moderately unstable in the outer part of the 3:2 resonance and thus 2007
TY430 is likely an escaped ""cold"" classical object that later got trapped in
resonance. Similar to the known binaries in the cold classical population, 2007
TY430 requires a high albedo and very low density to obtain the total mass
found. For a realistic minimum density of 0.5 g/cm^3 the albedo of 2007 TY430
would be greater than 0.17. The radii of either component should be less than
60 km and thus the relatively low eccentricity of the binary is interesting
since no tides should be operating on the bodies. The low prograde inclination
of the binary also makes it unlikely the Kozai mechanism has altered the orbit,
making 2007 TY430 likely one of the few relatively unaltered primordial binary
orbits known. Under some binary formation models, the low inclination prograde

and exploit a technique to determine stellar effective temperatures from
optical colors, nearly doubling the previously available number of objects with
effective temperature determinations in this benchmark cluster. Our technique
utilizes colors from deep photometry in the I-band and in two medium-band
filters at lambda~753 and 770nm, which accurately measure the depth of a
molecular feature present in the spectra of cool stars. From these colors we
can derive effective temperatures with a precision corresponding to better than
one-half spectral subtype, and importantly this precision is independent of the
extinction to the individual stars. Also, because this technique utilizes only
photometry redward of 750nm, the results are only mildly sensitive to optical
veiling produced by accretion. Completing our census with previously available
data, we place some 1750 sources in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and assign
masses and ages down to 0.02 solar masses. At faint luminosities, we detect a
large population of background sources which is easily separated in our
photometry from the bona fide cluster members. The resulting initial mass
function of the cluster has good completeness well into the substellar mass

a deficiency of newly formed brown dwarfs in the cluster compared to the

function predicted by Lambda-CDM, and it is widely accepted that this is due to
energy feedback from supernovae and black holes. However, the strength and form
of this feedback is not understood. In this paper, we use the phenomenological
model GALFORM to explore how galaxy formation depends on the strength and halo
mass dependence of feedback. We focus on 'expulsion' models in which the wind
mass loading, beta, is proportional to 1/\vdisk^n, with n=0,1,2 and contrast
these models with the successful Bower et al.\ 2008 model (B8W7). A crucial
development is that our code explicitly accounts for the recapture of expelled
gas as the system's halo mass (and thus gravitational potential) increases. We
find that a model with modest wind speed but high mass loading matches the flat
portion of the SMF. When combined with AGN feedback, the model provides a good
description of the observed SMF above 10^9 h^-1 Msol. However, in the expulsion
models, the brightest galaxies are assembled more recently than in B8W7, and
the specific star formation rates of galaxies decrease strongly with decreasing
stellar mass. The expulsion models also tend to have a cosmic star formation
density that is dominated by lower mass galaxies at z=1-3, and dominated high
mass galaxies at low redshift. These trends are in conflict with observational
data, but the comparison highlights some deficiencies of the B8W7 model also.
The experiments in this paper give us important physical insight to the impact
of the feedback process on the formation histories of galaxies, but the strong
mass dependence of feedback adopted in B8W7 still appears to provide the most
promising description of the observed universe.

has often been assumed that phonon effects are benign because they play no role

dynamics state probabilities converge to the static spin Hamiltonian prediction
at the cost of reducing the spin entanglement. We show how phonon creation can

known to result in angular momentum exchange between them. Understanding
astrophysical manifestations of this coupling such as gap opening by planets in
protoplanetary disks or clearing of gas by binary supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) embedded in accretion disks requires knowledge of the spatial
distribution of the torque exerted on the disk by a perturber. Recent
hydrodynamical simulations by Dong et al (2011) have shown evidence for the
tidal torque density produced in a uniform disk to change sign at the radial
separation of $\approx 3.2$ scale heights from the perturber's orbit, in clear
conflict with the previous studies. To clarify this issue we carry out a linear
calculation of the disk-satellite interaction putting special emphasis on
understanding the behavior of the perturbed fluid variables in physical space.
Using analytical as well as numerical methods we confirm the reality of the
negative torque density phenomenon and trace its origin to the overlap of
Lindblad resonances in the vicinity of the perturber's orbit - an effect not
accounted for in previous studies. These results suggest that calculations of
the gap and cavity opening in disks by planets and binary SMBHs should rely on
more realistic torque density prescriptions than the ones used at present.

Cp and electrical resistivity rho measurements versus temperature T from 1.8 to

SrCu2As2 crystallizes in the ThCr2Si2-type structure and SrCu2Sb2 crystallizes
in the CaBe2Ge2-type structure. However, BaCu2Sb2 is found to have a large unit
cell consisting of three blocks. Here a ThCr2Si2-type block is sandwiched
between two CaBe2Ge2-type blocks along the c-axis, as reported, but likely with
a monoclinic distortion. The chi data of all these compounds are diamagnetic
and reveal nearly T-independent anisotropic behavior. The finite values of the
Sommerfeld linear specific heat coefficients gamma and the T dependences of rho
reveal metallic character of all four compounds. The electronic and magnetic
properties indicate that these compounds are sp metals with Cu in the 3d^{10}
electronic configuration corresponding to the oxidation state Cu^{+1}, as
previously predicted theoretically for (Sr,Ba)Cu2As2 by D. J. Singh. We find
that SrCu2As2 has a collapsed-tetragonal structure. The electronic character of
the Cu and the strength of the As-As interlayer bonding are both expected to
drastically change between weakly Cu-substituted BaFe2As and pure BaCu2As2.

correlated sources in the uplink of multi-cell FDMA networks. Our objective is
to find the optimum power and channel to sources, in order to minimize the
maximum distortion achieved by any source in the network. Given that the
network is multi-cell, the inter-cell interference must also be taken into
consideration. This resource allocation problem is NP-hard and the optimal
solution can only be found by exhaustive search over the entire solution space,
which is not computationally feasible. We propose a three step method to be
performed separately by the scheduler in each cell, which finds cross-layer
resource allocation in simple steps. The three- step algorithm separates the
problem into inter-cell resource management, grouping of sources for joint
decoding, and intra- cell channel assignment. For each of the steps we propose
allocation methods that satisfy different design constraints. In the
simulations we compare methods for each step of the algorithm. We also
demonstrate the overall gain of using correlation-aware resource allocation for
a typical multi-cell network of Gaussian sources. We show that, while using
correlation in compression and joint decoding can achieve 25% loss in
distortion over independent decoding, this loss can be increased to 37% when
correlation is also utilized in resource allocation method. This significant
distortion loss motivates further work in correlation-aware resource
allocation. Overall, we find that our method achieves a 60% decrease in 5
percentile distortion compared to independent methods.

immersed into a noninteracting metallic host. The scheme is based on direct
perturbation theory in the hybridization between the impurity and band
electrons. This two-impurity enhanced noncrossing approximation (TIE) fully
incorporates the indirect interaction between the impurities which are mediated
by the conduction electrons as well as additional arbitrary direct interaction
matrix elements. We qualify the approximation by investigating the uncoupled
case and conclude the TIE to be equally accurate as its single impurity
counterpart. The physical properties of the two-impurity Anderson model are
first investigated in some limiting cases. In a regime, where each of the
uncoupled two impurities would exhibit a pronounced Kondo effect, we ignore the
indirect coupling via the conduction band and only incorporate direct
interactions. For a ferromagnetic direct exchange coupling, the system displays
a behavior similar to a spin-one Kondo effect, while an antiferromagnetic
coupling competes with the Kondo effect and produces a pseudogap in the
many-body Kondo resonance of the single-particle spectral function.
Interestingly, a direct one-particle hopping also produces a pseudogap but
additionally pronounced side-peaks emerge. This gap is characteristically
different from the case with antiferromagnetic coupling, since it emerges as a
consequence of distinct Kondo effects for the bonding and anti-bonding orbital,
i.e.\ it reflects a splitting of even and odd parity states.For the general
case of only indirect coupling the results show signatures of all the
previously discussed limiting cases as function of the impurity-impurity
distance. We are led to the conclusion that the well known Doniach-scenario
captures essential aspects this model, but the details especially at small
distances are more complicated.

candidate for the origin of supermassive black holes, some of which grow to a
billion solar masses by z ~ 7. We determine the maximum masses such stars can
attain by accreting primordial gas. We find that at relatively low accretion
rates the strong ionizing radiation of these stars limits their masses to M_* ~
10^3 M_Sun (dM_acc/dt / 10^-3 M_Sun yr^-1)^8/7, where dM_acc/dt is the rate at
which the star gains mass. However, at the higher central infall rates usually
found in numerical simulations of protogalactic collapse (>~ 0.1 M_Sun yr^-1),
the lifetime of the star instead limits its final mass to >~ 10^6 M_Sun.
Furthermore, for the spherical accretion rates at which the star can grow, its
ionizing radiation is confined deep within the protogalaxy, so the evolution of
the star is decoupled from that of its host galaxy. Lyman alpha emission from
the surrounding H II region is trapped in these heavy accretion flows and
likely reprocessed into strong Balmer series emission, which may be observable
by the James Webb Space Telescope. This, along with strong He II 1640 Angstrom
and continuum emission, are likely to be the key observational signatures of
the progenitors of supermassive black holes at high redshift.

enough spectral region -from the visible to the mid-IR- to constrain from one
single spectrum the temperature structure of the atmosphere and the abundances
of the major molecular species. The spectral range and resolution are tailored
to separate bands belonging to up to 30 molecules to retrieve the composition
and temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. The target list for EChO
includes planets ranging from Jupiter-sized with equilibrium temperatures Teq
up to 2000 K, to those of a few Earth masses, with Teq ~300 K. We have
baselined a dispersive spectrograph design covering continuously the 0.4-16
micron spectral range in 6 channels (1 in the VIS, 5 in the IR), which allows
the spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,
depending on the target brightness. The instrument will be mounted behind a 1.5
m class telescope, passively cooled to 50 K, with the instrument structure and
optics passively cooled to ~45 K. EChO will be placed in a grand halo orbit

of instrumental equivalent widths into the Lick system is described, and
zero-point uncertainties are provided. Comparison of line indices of old M 31
clusters and Galactic globular clusters suggests an absence of important
differences in chemical composition between the two cluster systems. In
particular, CN indices in the spectra of M 31 and Galactic clusters are
essentially consistent with each other, in disagreement with several previous
works. We reanalyze some of the previous data, and conclude that reported CN
differences between M 31 and Galactic clusters were mostly due to data
calibration uncertainties. Our data support the conclusion that the chemical
compositions of Milky Way and M 31 globular clusters are not substantially
different, and that there is no need to resort to enhanced nitrogen abundances
to account for the optical spectra of M 31 globular clusters.

0.7-2 and 2-10 keV). We observe a highly significant and tight (~0.7 dex)
correlation between excess variance and MBH. The subsample of reverberation
mapped AGN shows an even smaller scatter (~0.45 dex) comparable to the one
induced by the MBH uncertainties. This implies that X-ray variability can be
used as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than
the ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.
accretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break
frequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the
normalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost
completely counterbalance each other. A highly significant correlation between
excess variance and 2-10 keV spectral index is observed. Both the variability
vs. LBol and FWHM_Hbeta correlations are consistent with being just by-products
of the correlation with MBH. The soft and medium variability is very well
correlated with the hard variability, suggesting that the additional soft
components (i.e. soft excess, warm absorber) add a minor contribution to the
total variability. Once the variability is rescaled for MBH and mdot, no
significant difference between narrow-line and broad-line Seyfert 1 is

For the Dp-branes, we find that the energy loss of our defect, in addition to
the expected quadratic dependence on velocity, depends on velocity only via an
effective blueshifted temperature - despite the existence of a microscopic
length scale in the theory. We also find, for a certain value of p and
dimension of the defect, that the energy loss has no dependence on temperature
or velocity other than the aforementioned quadratic dependence on velocity. For
the superfluid example, we find agreement with previous results on the

superallowed Fermi decays have been placed under scrutiny in recent years. A
stringent test of these models is to measure transitions for which the
correction is predicted to be large. The decay of 32Cl decay provides such a
test case. Purpose: To improve the gamma yields following the beta decay of
32Cl and to determine the ft values of the the beta branches, particularly the
one to the isobaric-analogue state in 32S. Method: Reaction-produced and
recoil-spectrometer-separated 32Cl is collected in tape and transported to a
counting location where beta-gamma coincidences are measured with a
precisely-calibrated HPGe detector. Results: The precision on the gamma yields
for most of the known beta branches has been improved by about an order of
magnitude, and many new transitions have been observed. We have determined
32Cl-decay transition strengths extending up to E_x~11 MeV. The ft value for
the decay to the isobaric-analogue state in 32S has been measured. A comparison
to a shell-model calculation shows good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: We have
experimentally determined the isospin-symmetry-breaking correction to the
superallowed transition of this decay to be (\delta_C-\delta_NS)_exp=5.4(9)%,
significantly larger than for any other known superallowed Fermi transition.
This correction agrees with a shell-model calculation, which yields
\delta_C-\delta_NS=4.8(5)%. Our results also provide a way to improve the
measured ft values for the beta decay of 32Ar.

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.3 and masses 0.9
Msun to 6 Msun. We encountered different regimes of neutron-capture
nucleosynthesis increasing in importance as the stellar mass decreases: the
22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction activated during the thermal pulses, the
13C(alpha,n)16O reaction activated in radiative conditions during the
interpulse periods, and the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction activated during the
thermal pulses, also as a result of mild proton ingestion episodes. The models
where the 13C burns radiatively (masses ~ 2 Msun) produce an overall good match
to carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars showing s-process enhancements
(CEMP-s), except they produce too much Na and F. On the other hand, none of our
models can provide a match to the composition of CEMP stars also showing
rapid-process enhancements (CEMP-s/r). The models fail to reproduce the
observed Eu abundances, and they also fail to reproduce the correlation between
the Eu and Ba abundances. They also cannot match the ratio of heavy to light
s-process elements observed in many CEMP-s/r stars, which can be more than ten
times higher than in the solar system. To explain the composition of CEMP-s/r
stars we need to invoke the existence of a different ""s/r"" neutron-capture
process either with features in-between the s and the r processes, or generated
by superpositions of different neutron-capture processes in the same
astrophysical site or in sites linked to each other - for example, in multiple
stellar systems.

must be falsifiable; that is, subject to observational tests that could render
them false, and both fail when viscous, diffusive, astro-biological and
turbulence effects are included in the interpretation of observations. A more
plausible explanation of negative stresses producing the big bang is turbulence
at Planck temperatures. Inflation results from gluon viscous stresses at the
strong force transition. Anti-gravitational (dark energy) turbulence stresses
are powerful but only temporary. No permanent dark energy is needed. At the
plasma-gas transition, viscous stresses cause fragmentation of plasma
proto-galaxies into dark matter clumps of primordial gas planets, each of which
falsifies dark-energy cold-dark-matter cosmologies. Clumps of these planets
form all stars, and explain the alleged accelerating expansion of the universe
as a systematic dimming error of Supernovae Ia by light scattered in the hot
turbulent atmospheres of evaporated planets surrounding central white dwarf

detail even with the best telescopes available at earth. For much of the early
history of the Kuiper belt, studies of the compositions of these objects were
relegated to collections of moderate quality spectral and photometric data that
remained difficult to interpret. Much early effort was put into simple
correlations of surface colors and identifications of spectral features, but it
was difficult to connect the observations to a larger understanding of the
region. The last decade, however, has seen a blossoming in our understanding of
the compositions of objects in the Kuiper belt. This blossoming is a product of
the discoveries of larger -- and thus easier to study -- objects, continued
dedication to the collection of a now quite large collection of high quality
photometric and spectroscopic observations, and continued work at the
laboratory and theoretical level. Today we now know of many processes which
affect the surface compositions of objects in the Kuiper belt, including
atmospheric loss, differentiation and cryovolcanism, radiation processing, the
effects of giant impacts, and the early dynamical excitation of the Kuiper
belt. We review the large quantity of data now available and attempt to build a
comprehensive framework for understanding the surface compositions and their
causes. In contrast to surface compositions, the bulk compositions of objects
in the Kuiper belt remain poorly measured and even more poorly understood, but
prospects for a deeper understanding of the formation of the the outer solar

the thermocapillary motion of planar droplets in the uniform temperature
gradients is steady at moderate Marangoni numbers, but unsteady at large
Marangoni numbers. The instantaneous migration velocity at a fixed migration
distance decreases with increasing Marangoni numbers. The simulation results of
the thermocapillary droplet migration at large Marangoni numbers are found in
qualitative agreement with those of experimental investigations. Moreover, the
results concerned with steady and unsteady migration processes are further
confirmed by comparing the variations of temperature fields inside and outside
the droplet. It is evident that at large Marangoni numbers the weak transport
of thermal energy from outside of the droplet into inside cannot satisfy the
condition of steady migration process, which implies that the advection around
the droplet is a more significant mechanism for heat transfer across/around the
droplet at large Ma numbers. Furthermore, from the condition of overall
steady-state energy balance in the flow domain, the thermal flux across its
surface is studied for a steady thermocapillary droplet migration in a flow
field with uniform temperature gradient. By using the asymptotic expansion
method, a nonconservative integral thermal flux across the surface is
identified in the steady thermocapillary droplet migration at large Marangoni
numbers. This nonconservative flux may well result from the invalid assumption
of quasi-steady state, which indicates that the thermocapillary droplet
migration at large Marangoni numbers cannot reach steady state and is thus a
unsteady process.

axioms that a measure of tie strength must satisfy, we characterize functions
that satisfy all the axioms and show that there is a range of measures that
satisfy this characterization. A measure of tie strength induces a ranking on
the edges (and on the set of neighbors for every person). We show that for
applications where the ranking, and not the absolute value of the tie strength,
is the important thing about the measure, the axioms are equivalent to a
natural partial order. Also, to settle on a particular measure, we must make a
non-obvious decision about extending this partial order to a total order, and
that this decision is best left to particular applications. We classify
measures found in prior literature according to the axioms that they satisfy.
In our experiments, we measure tie strength and the coverage of our axioms in
several datasets. Also, for each dataset, we bound the maximum Kendall's Tau
divergence (which measures the number of pairwise disagreements between two
lists) between all measures that satisfy the axioms using the partial order.
This informs us if particular datasets are well behaved where we do not have to
worry about which measure to choose, or we have to be careful about the exact
choice of measure we make.

gravitational wave background from SNe Ia acts as a noise background in the
frequency range 0.1 - 10 Hz, which heretofore was thought to be relatively free
from astrophysical sources apart from neutron star binaries, and therefore a
key window in which to study primordial gravitational waves generated by
inflation. While inflationary energy scales of $\gtrsim 10^{16}$ GeV yield
inflationary gravitational wave backgrounds in excess of our range of predicted

gravitational wave background becomes comparable to the noise background from

channels under an outage constraint. More specifically, we extend the
definition of outage capacity to account for the secrecy constraint and obtain
sharp characterizations of the corresponding fundamental limits under two
different assumptions on the transmitter CSI (Channel state information).
First, we find the outage secrecy capacity assuming that the transmitter has
perfect knowledge of the legitimate and eavesdropper channel gains. In this
scenario, the capacity achieving scheme relies on opportunistically exchanging
private keys between the legitimate nodes. These keys are stored in a key
buffer and later used to secure delay sensitive data using the Vernam's one
time pad technique. We then extend our results to the more practical scenario
where the transmitter is assumed to know only the legitimate channel gain.
Here, our achievability arguments rely on privacy amplification techniques to
generate secret key bits. In the two cases, we also characterize the optimal
power control policies which, interestingly, turn out to be a judicious
combination of channel inversion and the optimal ergodic strategy. Finally, we
analyze the effect of key buffer overflow on the overall outage probability.

change over time and is of great utility in modelling modern wireless, mobile
and dynamic environments. As a graph evolves, possibly arbitrarily, it is
challenging to identify the graph properties that can be preserved over time
and understand their respective computability.
  In this paper we are concerned with the treewidth of dynamic graphs. We focus
on metatheorems, which allow the generation of a series of results based on
general properties of classes of structures. In graph theory two major
metatheorems on treewidth provide complexity classifications by employing
structural graph measures and finite model theory. Courcelle's Theorem gives a
general tractability result for problems expressible in monadic second order
logic on graphs of bounded treewidth, and Frick & Grohe demonstrate a similar
result for first order logic and graphs of bounded local treewidth.
  We extend these theorems by showing that dynamic graphs of bounded (local)
treewidth where the length of time over which the graph evolves and is observed
is finite and bounded can be modelled in such a way that the (local) treewidth
of the underlying graph is maintained. We show the application of these results
to problems in dynamic graph theory and dynamic extensions to static problems.
In addition we demonstrate that certain widely used dynamic graph classes
naturally have bounded local treewidth.

copy others. Varying the ratio of herders led to qualitative changes in the

small, the sequence of choices rapidly converges to the true one. As the ratio
approaches 100%, convergence becomes extremely slow and information aggregation
almost terminates. A simulation study of a stochastic model for 10^{6} subjects

coronagraph designed to deliver high contrast at small angular separation. To
achieve this, an accurate control of low order aberrations, such as pointing
and focus errors, is essential to optimize coronagraphic rejection and avoid
the possible confusion between exoplanet light and coronagraphic leaks in the
science image. Simulations and laboratory prototyping have shown that a
Coronagraphic Low Order Wave-Front Sensor (CLOWFS), using a single defocused
image of a reflective focal plane ring, can be used to control tip-tilt to an
accuracy of 10^{-3} lambda/D. This paper demonstrates that the data acquired by
CLOWFS can also be used in post-processing to calibrate residual coronagraphic
leaks from the science image. Using both the CLOWFS camera and the science
camera in the system, we quantify the accuracy of the method and its ability to
successfully remove light due to low order errors from the science image. We
also report the implementation and performance of the CLOWFS on the Subaru
Coronagraphic Extreme AO (SCExAO) system and its expected on-sky performance.
In the laboratory, with a level of disturbance similar to what is encountered
in a post Adaptive Optics beam, CLOWFS post-processing has achieved speckle
calibration to 1/300 of the raw speckle level. This is about 40 times better
than could be done with an idealized PSF subtraction that does not rely on
CLOWFS.

scenarios where direct application of such models is difficult. This paper
presents a temporal approach to stochastic network calculus. The key idea is to
develop models and derive results from the time perspective. Particularly, we
define traffic models and service models based on the cumulative packet
inter-arrival time and the cumulative packet service time, respectively.
Relations among these models as well as with the existing models in the

region of a star contracts and the outer envelope expands and cools, giving
rise to a red giant, in which convection occupies a large fraction of the star.
Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate
faster than their envelopes, and indirect evidence supports this. Information
about the angular momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations,
but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that
probe the stellar interior. Here, we report the detection of non-rigid rotation
in the interiors of red-giant stars by exploiting the rotational frequency
splitting of recently detected mixed modes. We demonstrate an increasing
rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core. Comparing with
theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten
times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the
theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the
deep stellar interior.

magnetic field $B$ has been studied beyond the mean field theory (MFT). Instead
of the spinors, the many body spin-eigenstates have been obtained. We have
defined and calculated the spin correlative probabilities to extract
information from these eigenstates. The correlation coefficients and the
fidelity susceptibility have also been calculated. Thereby the details of the
spin-structures responding to the variation of $B$ can be better understood. In
particular, from the correlation coefficients which is the ratio of the 2-body
probability to the product of two 1-body probabilities, strong correlation
domains (SCD) of $B$ are found. The emphasis is placed on the sensitivity of
the condensates against $B$. No phase transitions in spin-structures are found.
However, abrupt changes in the derivatives of observables (correlative
probabilities) are found in some particular domains of $B$. In these domains
the condensates are highly sensitive to $B$. The effect of temperature is
considered. The probabilities defined in the paper can work as a bridge to
relate theories and experiments. Therefore, they can be used to discriminate
various spin-structures and refine the interactions.

to be well-behaved in the strong-field, fast motion regime, notably up to the
EOB-defined last unstable orbit. Building conceptually upon the procedure
adopted to resum the multipolar asymptotic energy flux, we introduce a {\it
multiplicative} decomposition of the multipolar absorbed flux made by three
factors: (i) the leading-order contribution, (ii) an ""effective source"" and
(iii) a new residual amplitude correction $(\tilde{\rho}_\lm^H)^{2\ell}$. In
the test-mass limit, we use a frequency-domain perturbative approach to
accurately compute numerically the horizon-absorbed fluxes along a sequence of
stable and unstable circular orbits and we extract from them the functions
$\tilde{\rho}_\lm^H$. These quantities are then fitted via rational functions.
The resulting analytically represented test-mass knowledge is then suitably
{\it hybridized} with lower-order analytical information that is valid for any
mass ratio. This yields a resummed representation of the absorbed flux for a
generic, circularized, nonspinning black-hole binary. Our result adds new

concepts for the accelerator complex, the neutrino detectors, and the
instrumentation systems. The IDS-NF is, in essence, a site-independent study.

parameter in functional linear regression, where scalar responses are modeled
in dependence of random functions. In Johannes and Schenk [2010] it has been
shown that a plug-in estimator based on dimension reduction and additional
thresholding can attain minimax optimal rates of convergence up to a constant.
However, this estimation procedure requires an optimal choice of a tuning
parameter with regard to certain characteristics of the slope function and the
covariance operator associated with the functional regressor. As these are
unknown in practice, we investigate a fully data-driven choice of the tuning
parameter based on a combination of model selection and Lepski's method, which
is inspired by the recent work of Goldenshluger and Lepski [2011]. The tuning
parameter is selected as the minimizer of a stochastic penalized contrast
function imitating Lepski's method among a random collection of admissible
values. We show that this adaptive procedure attains the lower bound for the
minimax risk up to a logarithmic factor over a wide range of classes of slope
functions and covariance operators. In particular, our theory covers point-wise
estimation as well as the estimation of local averages of the slope parameter.

simple way for proving the difference between the classical world and the
quantum world. A non-local game is a cooperative game played by 2 or more
players against a referee. The players cannot communicate but may share common
random bits or a common quantum state. A referee sends an input $x_i$ to the
$i^{th}$ player who then responds by sending an answer $a_i$ to the referee.
The players win if the answers $a_i$ satisfy a condition that may depend on the
inputs $x_i$.
  Typically, non-local games are studied in a framework where the referee picks
the inputs from a known probability distribution. We initiate the study of
non-local games in a worst-case scenario when the referee's probability
distribution is unknown and study several non-local games in this scenario.

atomic data uncertainties on the results, and 5) the number of ions whose lines

unable to retrieve isothermal plasmas to better than Delta log T = 0.05. Also,
the DEM curves obtained using lines calculated with an isothermal plasma and
with a Gaussian distribution with FWHM of log T = 0.05 are very similar. Two
near-isothermal components can be resolved if their temperature separation is
Delta log T = 0.2 or larger. Thus, DEM diagnostics has an intrinsic resolving
power of log T = 0.05. Atomic data uncertainties may significantly affect both
temperature and peak DEM values, but do not alter our conclusions. The
availability of small sets of lines also does not worsen the performance of the
MCMC technique, provided these lines are formed in a wide temperature range.

In our approach, the wave function is decomposed in terms of an infinite set of
moments, which encode the complete quantum information of the system.
Semiclassical regimes can then be properly described by truncation of this
infinite system. The use of efficient computer algebra tools allows us to
compute the equations of motion up to a very high order. In this way, we can
study very precisely the quantum back reaction of the system as well as the
convergence of the method with the considered order. Finally, these tools are

observing Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the hard X-ray band with the SuperAGILE
imager and in the MeV range with the Mini-Calorimeter. Up to now, three firm
GRB detections were obtained above 25 MeV and some bursts were detected with
lower statistical confidence in the same energy band. When a GRB is localized,
either by SuperAGILE or Swift/BAT or INTEGRAL/IBIS or Fermi/GBM or IPN, inside
the field of view of the Gamma Ray Imager of AGILE, a detection is searched for
in the gamma ray band or an upper limit is provided. A promising result of
AGILE is the detection of very short gamma ray transients, a few ms in duration
and possibly identified with Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes. In this paper we
show the current status of the observation of Gamma Ray Bursts and Terrestrial
Gamma-ray Flashes with AGILE.

many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). In TDDFT the exchange-correlation effects
are described within a recently proposed adiabatic local density approximation

minimization of the local energy. The most well-known case is the exchange
interaction that leads to magnetic order in some materials. We discovered a new
similar process occurring in connection with an electronic phase separation
transition that leads to charge inhomogeneity in cuprate superconductors. The
minimization of the local free energy, described here by the Cahn-Hilliard
diffusion equation, drives the charges into regions of low and high densities.
This motion leads to an effective potential with two-fold effect: creation of
tiny isolated regions or micrograins, and two-body attraction, which promotes
local or intra-grain superconducting pairing. Consequently, as in granular
superconductors, the superconducting transition appears in two steps. First,
with local intra-grain superconducting amplitudes and, at lower temperature,
the superconducting phase or resistivity transition is attained by intergrain
Josephson coupling. We show here that this approach reproduces the main
features of the cuprates phase diagram, gives a clear interpretation to the
pseudogap phase and yields the position dependent local density of states gap
$\Delta(\vec r)$ measured by tunnelling experiments.

Comet family. It was observed with several telescopes (ESO NTT, La Silla;
Gemini North, Mauna Kea; UH 2.2m, Mauna Kea) from 14 Jan. until 19 Feb. 2010 in
order to characterize and monitor it and its very unusual dust tail, which
appears almost fully detached from the nucleus; the head of the tail includes
two narrow arcs forming a cross. The immediate surroundings of the nucleus were
found dust-free, which allowed an estimate of the nucleus radius of 80-90m. A
model of the thermal evolution indicates that such a small nucleus could not
maintain any ice content for more than a few million years on its current
orbit, ruling out ice sublimation dust ejection mechanism. Rotational spin-up
and electrostatic dust levitations were also rejected, leaving an impact with a
smaller body as the favoured hypothesis, and ruling out the cometary nature of
the object.
  The impact is further supported by the analysis of the tail structure.
Finston-Probstein dynamical dust modelling indicates the tail was produced by a
single burst of dust emission. More advanced models, independently indicate
that this burst populated a hollow cone with a half-opening angle alpha~40degr
and with an ejection velocity v_max ~ 0.2m/s, where the small dust grains fill
the observed tail, while the arcs are foreshortened sections of the burst cone.
The dust grains in the tail are measured to have radii between a=1-20mm, with a
differential size distribution proportional to a^(-3.44 +/- 0.08). The dust
contained in the tail is estimated to at least 8x10^8kg, which would form a
sphere of 40m radius. Analysing these results in the framework of crater
physics, we conclude that a gravity-controlled crater would have grown up to
~100m radius, i.e. comparable to the size of the body. The non-disruption of
the body suggest this was an oblique impact.

Bjorken variable $x \cong Q^2/W^2 \lsim ~ 0.1$ proceeds via fluctuations of the
photon into quark-antiquark dipole states that subsequently interact with the
gluon field in the nucleon. Dependent on the interaction energy, $W$, the
color-gauge-invariant dipole interaction with the gluon field in the nucleon,
for any fixed dipole size, contains the limits of i) color transparency and ii)
saturation, where ""saturation"" stands for the approach to a hadronlike
dipole-proton interaction cross section. All essential features of the
experimental results on low-x DIS, as a consequence of the
color-gauge-invariant dipole interaction follow model independently i.e.
without specific ansatz for the dipole cross section. The model-independent
results in particular include the low-x scaling behavior of the photoabsorption
cross section, $\sigma_{\gamma^*p} (W^2,Q^2) = \sigma_{\gamma^*p} (\eta
(W^2,Q^2))$, with definite functional dependence on the low-x scaling variable
$\eta (W^2,Q^2) \cong Q^2/\Lambda^2_{sat} (W^2)$ in the limits of $\eta
(W^2,Q^2) \gg 1$ and $\eta (W^2,Q^2) \ll 1$, respectively. Consistency with the
pQCD-improved parton model implies the definite value of $C_2 \cong 0.29$ for
the exponent in the ""saturation scale"", $\Lambda^2_{sat} (W^2) \approx
(W^2)^{C_2}$. The longitudinal-to-transverse ratio of the photoabsorption cross
section at large $Q^2$ has the definite value of $R = 1/2 \rho$ with $\rho =
4/3$. For $W^2 \to \infty$ at any fixed $Q^2$, the photoabsorption cross
section converges towards a $Q^2$-independent saturation limit that coincides
with the cross section for $Q^2 = 0$ photoproduction.

analytically only under assumptions (e.g., sparseness of the network) that are
unrealistic for most economic networks like the World Trade Web (WTW). In this
paper we study the evolution of the WTW using a recently-proposed family of
null network models. The method allows to analytically obtain the expected
value of any network statistic across the ensemble of networks that preserve on
average some local properties, and are otherwise fully random. We compare
expected and observed properties of the WTW in the period 1950-2000, when
either the expected number of trade partners or total country trade is kept
fixed and equal to observed quantities. We show that, in the binary WTW,
node-degree sequences are sufficient to explain higher-order network properties
such as disassortativity and clustering-degree correlation, especially in the
last part of the sample. Conversely, in the weighted WTW, the observed sequence
of total country imports and exports are not sufficient to predict higher-order
patterns of the WTW. We discuss some important implications of these findings

component peaking in the THz range, simultaneously with the well known
microwaves component, bringing challenging constraints for interpretation.
Higher THz frequencies observations are needed to understand the nature of the
mechanisms occurring in flares. A THz photometer system was developed to
observe outside the terrestrial atmosphere on stratospheric balloons or
satellites, or at exceptionally transparent ground stations. The telescope was
designed to observe the whole solar disk detecting small relative changes in
input temperature caused by flares at localized positions. A Golay cell
detector is preceded by low-pass filters to suppress visible and near IR
radiation, a band-pass filter, and a chopper. A prototype was assembled to
demonstrate the new concept and the system performance. It can detect
temperature variations smaller than 1 K for data sampled at a rate of
10/second, smoothed for intervals larger than 4 seconds. For a 76 mm aperture,
this corresponds to small solar burst intensities at THz frequencies. A system
with 3 and 7 THz photometers is being built for solar flare observations on
board of stratospheric balloon missions.

free, for which, due to their high energy-momentum and leaving aside inner a.m.
or spin, the $h$-quantization step is completely harmless.
  Perhaps Quantum Mechanics can be seen just as the simplest mathematical
formalism where angular momentum (the magnitude of each of its three orthogonal
projections) is by construction quantized: all possible values are taken from a
discrete set. Indeed:
  (i) This idea finds support in very reasonable, completely classical physical
arguments, if we place ourselves in the framework of Stochastic Electrodynamics
(SED): there, all sustained periodic movement of a charge must satisfy a power
balance that restricts the value of the average angular momentum, on each of
its projections.
  (ii) It gives a natural explanation of the concept of ""photon"", as a
constraint on the observable spectrum of energy-momentum exchanges between
metastable physical states, in particular also for its discreteness.
  QM would be, in this picture, a semi-static theory, transparent to all the
(micro)-dynamics taking place between apparently ""discrete"" events (transitions
in the state of the system). For instance, (the magnitude of the projections
of) quantum angular momentum would only reflect average values over a
(classical) cyclic trajectory, a fact that we regard as almost obvious given
the particularity of the corresponding addition rules in QM.

"1201.1189","Jerome Faillettaz","Jerome Faillettaz, Martin Funk and Didier Sornette","Prediction of alpine glacier sliding instabilities: a new hope","34 pages, 22 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mechanical and sliding instabilities are the two processes which may lead to
breaking off events of large ice masses. Mechanical instabilities mainly affect
unbalanced cold hanging glaciers. For the latter case, a prediction could be
achieved based on data of surface velocities and seismic activity. The case of
sliding instabilities is more problematic. This phenomenon occurs on temperate
glacier tongues. Such instabilities are strongly affected by the subglacial
hydrology: melt water may cause (i) a lubrication of the bed and (ii) a
decrease of the effective pressure and consequently a decrease of basal
friction. Available data from Allalingletscher (Valais) indicate that the
glacier tongue experienced an active phase during 2-3 weeks with enhanced basal
motion in late summer in most years. In order to scrutinize in more detail the
processes governing the sliding instabilities, a numerical model developed to
investigate gravitational instabilities in heterogeneous media was applied to
Allalingletscher. This model enables to account for various geometric
configurations, interaction between sliding and tension cracking and water flow
at the bedrock. We could show that both a critical geometrical configuration of
the glacier tongue and the existence of a distributed drainage network were the
main causes of this catastrophic break-off. Moreover, the analysis of the
modeling results diagnose the phenomenon of recoupling of the glacier to its
bed as a potential new precursory sign announcing the final break-off. This
model casts a gleam of hope for a better understanding of the ultimate rupture
of such glacier sliding instabilities.
