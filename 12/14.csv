it is due to remarkable roles of the carbon triple bonds in electronic and
atomic structures. The carbon triple bonds modulate effective hopping matrix
elements and reverse their signs, resulting in Dirac cones with reversed
chirality in alpha graphyne, momentum shift of the Dirac point in beta
graphyne, and switch of the energy gap in gamma graphyne. Furthermore, the
triple bonds provide chemisorption sites of adatoms which can break sublattice
symmetry while preserving planar sp2-bonding networks. These features of
graphyne open new possibilities for electronic applications of carbon-based
two-dimensional materials and derived nanostructures.

Organisms use a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves
against perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback
loops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and biochemical filters
distinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in
terms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of
performance to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings. I use a
mathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order
to understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two
characters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character
buffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased
perturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases
sensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive
character. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to
a less costly, lower performance trait. Conclusions/Significance. The paradox
of robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an
evolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character,
leading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by
natural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary
time, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the
underlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance
components. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for
understanding organismal design.

interaction models which have been extensively used in nuclear structure and
reaction studies, namely, the isospin and momentum dependent MDI interaction

analyze the contribution of different terms in the single-nucleon potential to
the $E_{sym}(\rho)$ and $L(\rho)$. Our results show that the observed different
density behaviors of $E_{sym}(\rho)$ for different interactions are essentially
due to the variation of the symmetry potential $U_{sym,1}(\rho,k)$.
Furthermore, we find that the contribution of the second-order symmetry
potential $U_{sym,2}(\rho,k)$ to the $L(\rho)$ generally cannot be neglected.
Moreover, our results demonstrate that the magnitude of the $U_{sym,2}(\rho,k)$
is generally comparable with that of $U_{sym,1}(\rho,k)$, indicating the
second-order symmetry potential $U_{sym,2}(\rho,k)$ may have significant
corrections to the widely used Lane approximation to the single-nucleon

are derived by fitting the multi-band photometry with model spectral energy

Our estimated ages and masses of young clusters are in good agreement with

spatial distributions similar to other tracers of disk structure such as OB

source with rapid variation and very flat spectrum in the TeV band. To explain
the two-peaks in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the nucleus of M87
which is similar to those of blazars, the most commonly adopted models are the
synchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) models and the external inverse
Compton scattering (EIC) models. Considering that there is no correlated
variation in the soft band (from radio to X-ray) matching the TeV variation,
and the TeV sources should not suffer from the gamma-gamma absorption due to
the flat TeV spectrum, the EIC models are advantageous in modeling the TeV
emission from M87. In this paper, we propose a self-consistent EIC model to
explain the flat TeV spectrum of M87 within the framework of fully general
relativity, where the background soft photons are from the advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) around the central black hole, and the high energy
electrons are from the mini-jets which are powered by the magnetic reconnection
in the main jet (Giannios et al. 2010). In our model, both the TeV flares
observed in the years of 2005 and 2008 could be well explained: the gamma-gamma
absorption for TeV photons is very low, even inside the region very close to
the black hole 20Rg~50Rg; at the same region, the average EIC cooling time (~
10^2-10^3s) is short, which is consistent with the observed time scale of TeV
variation. Furthermore, we also discuss the possibility that the accompanying
X-ray flare in 2008 is due to the direct synchrotron radiation of the
mini-jets.

required an up-to-date model of spatial distribution of neutral interstellar
hydrogen in the heliosphere, and to that end, a credible model of the radiation
pressure and ionization processes was needed. This chapter describes the solar
factors shaping the distribution of neutral interstellar H in the heliosphere.
Presented are the solar Lyman-alpha flux and the solar Lyman-alpha resonant
radiation pressure force acting on neutral H atoms in the heliosphere, solar
EUV radiation and the photoionization of heliospheric hydrogen, and their
evolution in time and the still hypothetical variation with heliolatitude.
Further, solar wind and its evolution with solar activity is presented in the
context of the charge exchange ionization of heliospheric hydrogen, and in the
context of dynamic pressure variations. Also the electron ionization and its
variation with time, heliolatitude, and solar distance is presented. After a
review of all of those topics, we present an interim model of solar wind and
the other solar factors based on up-to-date in situ and remote sensing
observations of solar wind. Results of this effort will further be utilised to
improve on the model of solar wind evolution, which will be an invaluable asset
in all heliospheric measurements, including, among others, the observations of

understanding of the source in order to infer the unobserved redshift of GRB

89s of emission of GRB 101023 to see if we are in presence of two different
episodes: the first one presenting a characteristic Black-body temperature
evolution, evolving in time with a broken power-law, and the second one
consistent with a canonical GRB. [...] Results: We confirm that the first
episode can be well fit by a Black body plus a power-law model. The temperature
changes with time following a broken power law, and the photon index of the
power-law component presents a soft to hard evolution. We estimate the radius
of this source, increasing with time with a velocity of 1.5x10^4 km/s. The

component. A first one, related to the proto-black hole, prior to the process
of gravitational collapse (episode 1) and a second one which is the canonical

analysis indicates progress towards developing a GRB distance indicator based
on the understanding of the P-GRB and the prompt radiation as well as the soft
X-Ray behavior of the late afterglow.

their individual costs subject to a common vector variable. The costs are
convex, have Lipschitz continuous gradient (with constant $L$), and bounded
gradient. We propose two fast distributed gradient algorithms based on the
centralized Nesterov gradient algorithm and establish their convergence rates
in terms of the per-node communications $\mathcal{K}$ and the per-node gradient
evaluations $k$. Our first method, Distributed Nesterov Gradient, achieves
rates $O\left({\log \mathcal{K}}/{\mathcal{K}}\right)$ and $O\left({\log
k}/{k}\right)$. Our second method, Distributed Nesterov gradient with Consensus
iterations, assumes at all nodes knowledge of $L$ and $\mu(W)$ -- the second
largest singular value of the $N \times N$ doubly stochastic weight matrix $W$.
It achieves rates $O\left({1}/{\mathcal{K}^{2-\xi}}\right)$ and
$O\left({1}/{k^2}\right)$ ($\xi>0$ arbitrarily small). Further, we give with
both methods explicit dependence of the convergence constants on $N$ and $W$.
Simulation examples illustrate our findings.

a strong depletion in carbon, but also lithium abundance anomalies that have
been little explored in the literature since the first discovery of these
peculiar objects in the early 50's. Here we focus on the Li-rich WGB stars and
report on their evolutionary status. We explore different paths to propose a
tentative explanation for the lithium anomaly. Using archive data, we derive
the fundamental parameters of WGB (Teff, log g, log(L/Lsun)) using Hipparcos
parallaxes and recent temperature scales. From the equivalent widths of Li
resonance line at 6707 {\AA}, we uniformly derive the lithium abundances and
apply when possible NLTE corrections following the procedure described by Lind
et al. (2009). We also compute dedicated stellar evolution models in the mass
range 3.0 to 4.5 Msun, exploring the effects of rotation-induced and
thermohaline mixing. These models are used to locate the WGB stars in the H-R
diagram and to explore the origin of the abundance anomalies. The location of
WGB stars in the H-R diagram shows that these are intermediate mass stars of
masses ranging from 3.0 to 4.5 Msun located at the clump, which implies a
degeneracy of their evolutionary status between subgiant/red giant branch and
core helium burning phases. The atmospheres of a large proportion of WGB stars
(more than 50%) exhibit lithium abundances A(Li) \geq 1.4 dex similar to
Li-rich K giants. The position of WGB stars along with the Li-rich K giants in
the H-R diagram however indicates that both are well separated groups. The
combined and tentatively consistent analysis of the abundance pattern for
lithium, carbon and nitrogen of WGB stars seems to indicate that carbon
underabundance could be decorrelated from the lithium and nitrogen
overabundances.

presence of counting quantifiers, which may be seen as variants of CSPs in the
mould of quantified CSPs (QCSPs). We show that a single counting quantifier
strictly between exists^1:=exists and exists^n:=forall (the domain being of
size n) already affords the maximal possible complexity of QCSPs (which have
both exists and forall), being Pspace-complete for a suitably chosen template.
Next, we focus on the complexity of subsets of counting quantifiers on clique
and cycle templates. For cycles we give a full trichotomy -- all such problems
are in L, NP-complete or Pspace-complete. For cliques we come close to a
similar trichotomy, but one case remains outstanding. Afterwards, we consider
the generalisation of CSPs in which we augment the extant quantifier
exists^1:=exists with the quantifier exists^j (j not 1). Such a CSP is already
NP-hard on non-bipartite graph templates. We explore the situation of this
generalised CSP on bipartite templates, giving various conditions for both
tractability and hardness -- culminating in a classification theorem for
general graphs. Finally, we use counting quantifiers to solve the complexity of
a concrete QCSP whose complexity was previously open.

phase separation could be the underlying mechanism of L to H transitions and
drive transport barrier formation. Magnetic phase separation and associated
pedestal build up, as described here, can be explained by the well known
interchange mechanism, now reinterpreted as a magnetisation interchange which
remains relevant even when stable or saturated. A testable necessary criterion
for the L to H transition is presented.

in bursts of creative cascades. We find that products systematically tend to
co-appear, and that product appearances lead to massive disappearance events of

followed by periods of appearances - is not observed. This is an empirical
validation of the dominance of cascading competitive replacement events on the

more complex products drive out less complex ones, i.e. progress has a

addressed in neural models and recognition algorithms. This work proposes a
configuration for recognition that maintains the same function of conventional
algorithms but avoids combinatorial problems. Feedforward recognition
algorithms such as classical artificial neural networks and machine learning
algorithms are known to be subject to catastrophic interference and forgetting.
Modifying or learning new information (associations between patterns and
labels) causes loss of previously learned information. I demonstrate using
mathematical analysis how supervised generative models, with feedforward and
feedback connections, can emulate feedforward algorithms yet avoid catastrophic
interference and forgetting. Learned information in generative models is stored
in a more intuitive form that represents the fixed points or solutions of the
network and moreover displays similar difficulties as cognitive phenomena.
Brain-like capabilities and limits associated with generative models suggest
the brain may perform recognition and store information using a similar
approach. Because of the central role of recognition, progress understanding
the underlying principles may reveal significant insight on how to better study
and integrate with the brain.

of the voltage sensor (VS), identified with the S1-S4 domain of voltage-gated K
channels. Here we investigate some physical aspects of the sliding-helix model
of the VS using simulations based on VS charges, linear dielectrics and
whole-body motion. Model electrostatics in voltage-clamped boundary conditions
are solved using a boundary element method. The statistical mechanical
consequences of the electrostatic configurational energy are computed to gain
insight into the sliding-helix mechanism and to predict experimentally measured
ensemble properties such as gating charge displaced by an applied voltage.
Those consequences and ensemble properties are investigated for variations of:
S4 configuration ({\alpha}- and 3(10)-helical), intrinsic counter-charges,
protein polarizability, geometry of the gating canal, screening of S4 charges
by the baths, and protein charges located at the bath interfaces. We find that
the sliding helix VS has an inherent electrostatic stability and its function
as a VS is robust in the parameter space explored. Maximal charge displacement
is limited by geometry, specifically the range of movement where S4 charges and
counter-charges overlap in the region of weak dielectric. The steepness of
charge rearrangement in the physiological voltage range is sensitive to the
landscape of electrostatic energy: energy differences of <2 kT have substantial
consequences. Such variations of energy landscape are produced by all
variations of model features tested. The amount of free energy per unit voltage
that a sliding-helix VS can deliver to other parts of the channel (conductance
voltage sensitivity) is limited by both the maximal displaced charge and the
steepness of charge redistribution by voltage (sensor voltage sensitivity).

perturbation of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker state described by a nearly
scale invariant, Gaussian, power-law distribution, and evolves in time until
non-linear structures have formed. After describing and attempting to control
for certain complications in the implementation of this approach, this metric
then forms a working model of the universe. We numerically calculate the
evolution of the average scale factor in this model and hence the backreaction.
We argue that, despite its limitations, this model is more realistic than
previous models that have confronted the issue of backreaction. We find that
the \emph{instantaneous} effects of backreaction in this model could be as
large as $\sim10%$ of the background. This suggests that a proper understanding

non-anomalous gauge and flavor symmetries and the matching of (most) 't Hooft

formation in radiatively-inefficient disc models, where positive corotation
torques may counter the rapid inward migration of low mass planets driven by
Lindblad torques. The aim of this work is to examine the nature of planetary
systems that arise from oligarchic growth in such discs. We adapt the
commonly-used Mercury-6 symplectic integrator by including simple prescriptions
for planetary migration (types I and II), planetary atmospheres that enhance
the probability of planetesimal accretion by protoplanets, gas accretion onto
forming planetary cores, and gas disc dispersal. We perform a suite of
simulations for a variety of disc models with power-law surface density and
tempera- ture profiles, with a focus on models in which unsaturated corotation
torques can drive outward migration of protoplanets. In some models we account
for the quenching of corotation torques that arises when planetary orbits
become eccentric. Approximately half of our simulations lead to the successful
formation of gas giant planets with a broad range of masses and semimajor axes.
  We conclude that convergent migration induced by corotation torques operating
during planet formation can enhance the growth rate of planetary cores, but
these often migrate into the central star because corotation torques saturate.
Outward migration of planetary cores of modest mass can lead to the formation
of gas giant planets at large distances from the central star, similar to those
observed recently through direct imaging surveys. The excitation of planetary
eccentricities through planet-planet scat- tering during oligarchic growth may
quench the effects of corotation torques, however, such that inward migration
is driven by Lindblad torques.

Sobolev embedding of $H^1(\R^2)$ in the critical Orlicz space ${\cL}(\R^2)$. It
turns out that up to cores our result is expressed in terms of the
concentration-type examples derived by J. Moser in \cite{M} as in the radial
setting investigated in \cite{BMM}. However, the analysis we used in this work
is strikingly different from the one conducted in the radial case which is
based on an $L^ \infty$ estimate far away from the origin and which is no
longer valid in the general framework. Within the general framework of
$H^1(\R^2)$, the strategy we adopted to build the profile decomposition in
terms of examples by Moser concentrated around cores is based on capacity
arguments and relies on an extraction process of mass concentrations. The
essential ingredient to extract cores consists in proving by contradiction that
if the mass responsible for the lack of compactness of the Sobolev embedding in
the Orlicz space is scattered, then the energy used would exceed that of the
starting sequence.

giant planets and brown dwarfs orbiting at separation larger than several AU.
Around solar-type stars, giant planets are expected to form by core accretion
or by gravitational instability, but since core accretion is increasingly
difficult as the primary star becomes lighter, gravitational instability would
be the a probable formation scenario for yet-to-be-found distant giant planets
around a low-mass star. A systematic survey for such planets around M dwarfs
would therefore provide a direct test of the efficiency of gravitational
instability. Aims. We search for gas giant planets orbiting around late-type
stars and brown dwarfs of the solar neighborhood. Methods. We obtained deep
high resolution images of 16 targets with the adaptive optic system of VLT-NACO
in the Lp band, using direct imaging and angular differential imaging. This is
currently the largest and deepest survey for Jupiter-mass planets around
Mdwarfs. We developed and used an integrated reduction and analysis pipeline to
reduce the images and derive our 2D detection limits for each target. The
typical contrast achieved is about 9 magnitudes at 0.5"" and 11 magnitudes
beyond 1"". For each target we also determine the probability of detecting a
planet of a given mass at a given separation in our images. Results. We derived
accurate detection probabilities for planetary companions, taking into account
orbital projection effects, with in average more than 50% probability to detect
a 3MJup companion at 10AU and a 1.5MJup companion at 20AU, bringing strong
constraints on the existence of Jupiter-mass planets around this sample of
young M-dwarfs.

signed Euclidean distance function $S$ on a set of 2D and 3D grid locations.
Instead of solving the non-linear, static Hamilton-Jacobi equation ($\|\nabla
S\|=1$), our solution stems from first solving for a scalar field $\phi$ in a
linear differential equation and then deriving the solution for $S$ by taking
the negative logarithm. In other words, when $S$ and $\phi$ are related by
$\phi = \exp \left(-\frac{S}{\tau} \right)$ and $\phi$ satisfies a specific
linear differential equation corresponding to the extremum of a variational
problem, we obtain the approximate Euclidean distance function $S = -\tau
\log(\phi)$ which converges to the true solution in the limit as $\tau
\rightarrow 0$. This is in sharp contrast to techniques like the fast marching
and fast sweeping methods which directly solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation by
the Godunov upwind discretization scheme. Our linear formulation results in a
closed-form solution to the approximate Euclidean distance function expressible
as a discrete convolution, and hence efficiently computable using the fast
Fourier transform (FFT). Our solution also circumvents the need for spatial
discretization of the derivative operator. As $\tau\rightarrow0$ we show the
convergence of our results to the true solution and also bound the error for a
given value of $\tau$. The differentiability of our solution allows us to
compute---using a set of convolutions---the first and second derivatives of the
approximate distance function. In order to determine the sign of the distance
function (defined to be positive inside a closed region and negative outside),
we compute the winding number in 2D and the topological degree in 3D, whose
computations can also be performed via fast convolutions. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our method through a set of experimental results.

chain with dimerized nearest-neighbor coupling. The particles are free of
interaction energies even at high densities. The mutual exclusion statistics of
particles from all species is determined by their internal structure and
encoded in a generalized Pauli principle. The exact statistical mechanical
analysis can be performed for thermodynamically open or closed systems and with
arbitrary energies assigned to all particle species. Special circumstances make
it possible to merge two or more species into a single species. All traits that
distinguish the original species become ignorable. The particles from the
merged species are effectively indistinguishable and obey modified exclusion
statistics. Different mergers may yield the same endproduct, implying that the
inverse process (splitting any species into subspecies) is not unique. In a
macroscopic system of two merged species at thermal equilibrium, the
concentrations of the original species satisfy a functional relation governed
by their mutual statistical interaction. That relation is derivable from an
extremum principle. In the Ising context the system is open and the particle
energies depend on the Hamiltonian parameters. Simple models of polymerization
and solitonic paramagnetism each represent a closed system of two species that
can transform into each other. Here they represent distinguishable traits with
different energies of the same physical particle.

acceleration of a sail, what is the cost-optimum high power system? Here the
cost is used to constrain design parameters to estimate system power, aperture

cost-optimal transmitter aperture and power, system cost scales with kinetic
energy and inversely with sail diameter and frequency. So optimal sails will be
larger, lower in mass and driven by higher frequency beams. Estimated costs

breaking parameter |A_0| are required, and universal scalar m_0\agt 0.8 TeV is
favored so that we expect squark and slepton masses typically in the multi-TeV
range. This typically gives rise to an ""effective SUSY"" type of sparticle mass
spectrum. In this case, we expect gluino pair production as the dominant
sparticle creation reaction at LHC. For m_0< 5 TeV, the superpotential
parameter \mu > 2 TeV and m_A> 0.8 TeV, greatly restricting neutralino
annihilation mechanisms. These latter conclusions are softened if m_0\sim 10-20

tends to be far above WMAP-measured values unless the neutralino is

in multidimensional space-times with symmetric connections, we consider the
spherical and cylindrical reductions of these theories to two-dimensional
dilaton-vecton gravity (DVG) field theories. The distinctive feature of these
theories is the presence of a massive/tachyonic vector field (vecton) with
essentially nonlinear coupling to the dilaton gravity. In the massless limit,
the classical DVG theory can be exactly solved for a rather general coupling
depending only on the field tensor and the dilaton. We show that the vecton
field can be consistently replaced by a new effectively massive scalar field
(scalaron) with an unusual coupling to dilaton gravity (DSG). Then we
concentrate on considering the DVG models derived by reductions of D=3 and D=4
affine theories. In particular, we introduce the most general cylindrical
reductions that are often ignored. The main subject of our study is the static
solutions with horizons. We formulate the general conditions for the existence
of the regular horizons and find the solutions of the static DVG/DSG near the
horizons in the form of locally convergent power - series expansion. For an
arbitrary regular horizon, we find a local generalization of the Szekeres -
Kruskal coordinates. Finally, we consider one-dimensional integrable and

separately from their direct opponents. Moreover, in large groups the presence
of a small number of defectors is bearable, which makes the mixed phase region
expand with increasing group size. Having a chance of exploiting distant

the parameters of some other scenarios would be severely restricted. Examples
of constrained MSSM scenarios which would be disfavoured as they predict a too
light Higgs particle are the minimal anomaly and gauge mediated supersymmetry
breaking models. The gravity mediated constrained MSSM would still be viable,
provided the scalar top quarks are heavy and their trilinear coupling large.
Significant areas of the parameter space of models with heavy supersymmetric

distribution and its derivative with respect to temperature, which deviate from
a black body in agreement with metal-line and molecular opacity effects. We
determine a mean reddening law towards the Cepheids in our sample, which is not
consistent with standard assumptions in either the optical or near-IR. Based on
stellar atmosphere models we predict the biases in distance, reddening, and

metallicity signature expected for our fit residuals. The observed residuals as
a function of wavelength show clear differences between the individual
galaxies, which are compatible with these predictions. In particular, we find
that metal-poor Cepheids appear hotter. Finally, we provide a framework for
optimally selecting filters that yield the smallest overall errors in Cepheid

properties but in our case one needs to pass at the interface a smaller amount
of data than previously known schemes. This is important for multi-block
parallelizations in several dimensions, for it implies that one obtains the
same solution quality while sharing among different computational grids only a
fraction of the data one would need for a comparable (in accuracy) SAT or

the norm and uses standard finite-difference operators satisfying summation by

This is crucial, since the explicit Runge-Kutta method would be impractical
given the severe restrictions that arise from the stiff parts of the equations.

possibly caused by the tidal disruption of a star. We aim to find evidence for
this scenario through linear polarimetry, as linear polarisation is a sensitive

the observed radiation. We find a formal Ks band polarisation measurement of

linear polarisation as a function of time. We find no evidence of linear
polarisation at radio wavelengths of 1.4 GHz and 4.8 GHz at any epoch, with the
most sensitive 3 sigma limits as deep as 2.1%. These upper limits are in

non-degenerate quadratic space (V,Q), where Q has signature \epsilon=(p,q), a
transposition anti-involution \tp. In a spinor representation, the
anti-involution \tp gives transposition, complex Hermitian conjugation or
quaternionic Hermitian conjugation when the spinor space \check{S} is viewed as
a \cl_{p,q}-left and \check{K}-right module with \check{K} isomorphic to R or
R^2, C, or, H or H^2.
  \tp is a lifting to \cl_{p,q} of an orthogonal involution \tve: V \rightarrow
V which depends on the signature of Q. The involution is a symmetric correlatio
\tve: V \rightarrow V^{*} \cong V and it allows one to define a reciprocal
basis for the dual space (V^{*},Q). The anti-involution \tp acts as reversion
on \cl_{p,0} and as conjugation on \cl_{0,q}. Using the concept of a transpose
of a linear mapping one can show that if [L_u] is a matrix in the left regular
representation of the operator L_u: \cl_{p,q} \rightarrow \cl_{p,q} relative to
a Grassmann basis B in \cl_{p,q}, then matrix [L_{\tp(u)}] is the matrix
transpose of [L_u].
  Of particular importance is the action of \tp on the algebraic spinor space
S, generated by a primitive idempotent f, or a sum f+\hat{f} in simple or
semisimple algebras. \tp allows us to define a new spinor scalar product S
\times S \rightarrow \check{K}, where K=f\cl_{p,q}f and \check{K}=K or K \oplus
\hat{K} in the simple or semisimple case. Our scalar product reduces to well
known ones in Euclidean and anti-Euclidean signatures. \tp acts as identity,
complex conjugation, or quaternionic conjugation on \check{K}. The action of
\tp on spinors results in matrix transposition, complex Hermitian conjugation,
or quaternionic ermitian conjugation. We classify the automorphism groups of
the new product as O(N), U(N), Sp(N), O(N)^2, or Sp(N)^2.

broadening, which is a common experimental observable, can be expressed in
terms of the variance of the distribution of the resulting polarization
orientation (the direction cosine). Here the broadening for symmetric-top and
linear rotors is discussed. These two types of rotors have qualitatively
different low-field orientation distribution functions, but behave similarly in
a strong field. While analytical expressions for the polarization variance can
be derived from first-order perturbation theory, for experimental guidance it
is important to identify the applicability and limitations of these
expressions, and the general dependence of the broadening on the experimental
parameters. For this purpose, the analytical results are compared with the full
diagonalization of the rotational Stark-effect matrices. Conveniently for
experimental estimations, it is found that for symmetric tops the dependence of
the broadening parameter on the rotational constant, the axial ratio, and the
field strength remains similar to the analytical expression even outside of the
perturbative regime. Also, it is observed that the shape envelope, the

many situations, however, users choose the time of their arrival strategically,
taking delay and other metrics into account. In this paper, we develop a
framework to study such strategic arrivals into queueing networks. We start by
deriving a functional strong law of large numbers (FSLLN) approximation to the
queueing network. In the fluid limit derived, we then study the population game
wherein users strategically choose when to arrive, and upon arrival which of
the K queues to join. The queues start service at given times, which can
potentially be different. We characterize the (strategic) arrival process at
each of the queues, and the price of anarchy of the ensuing strategic arrival
game. We then extend the analysis to multiple populations of users, each with a
different cost metric. The equilibrium arrival profile and price of anarchy are
derived. Finally, we present the methodology for exact equilibrium analysis.

$\Om_{0}$ to shape optimization problems among convex planar sets, namely: $$
J(\Om_{0})=\min\{J(\Om),\ \Om\ \textrm{convex},\ \Omega\in\mathcal S_{ad}\}, $$
where $\mathcal S_{ad}$ is a set of 2-dimensional admissible shapes and
$J:\mathcal{S}_{ad}\rightarrow\R$ is a shape functional. Our main goal is to
obtain qualitative properties of these optimal shapes by using first and second
order optimality conditions, including the infinite dimensional Lagrange
multiplier due to the convexity constraint. We prove two types of results: i)
under a suitable convexity property of the functional $J$, we prove that
$\Omega_0$ is a $W^{2,p}$-set, $p\in[1,\infty]$. This result applies, for
instance, with $p=\infty$ when the shape functional can be written as $
J(\Omega)=R(\Omega)+P(\Omega), $ where
$R(\Om)=F(|\Om|,E_{f}(\Om),\la_{1}(\Om))$ involves the area $|\Omega|$, the
Dirichlet energy $E_f(\Omega)$ or the first eigenvalue of the Laplace-Dirichlet
operator $\lambda_1(\Omega)$, and $P(\Omega)$ is the perimeter of $\Om$, ii)
under a suitable concavity assumption on the functional $J$, we prove that
$\Omega_{0}$ is a polygon. This result applies, for instance, when the
functional is now written as $ J(\Om)=R(\Omega)-P(\Omega), $ with the same
notations as above.

rotation induced by an achromatic half-wave plate on measurements of cosmic
microwave background polarization in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds.
We focus on the systematic effects induced on the measurement of inflationary
gravitational waves by uncertainties in the polarization and spectral index of
Galactic dust. We find that for the experimental configuration and noise levels
of the balloon-borne EBEX experiment, which has three frequency bands centered
at 150, 250, and 410 GHz, a crude dust subtraction process mitigates systematic
effects to below detectable levels for 10% polarized dust and tensor to scalar
ratio of as low as r = 0.01. We also study the impact of uncertainties in the
spectral response of the instrument. With a top-hat model of the spectral
response for each band, characterized by band-center and band-width, and with
the same crude dust subtraction process, we find that these parameters need to
be determined to within 1 and 0.8 GHz at 150 GHz; 9 and 2.0 GHz at 250 GHz; and
20 and 14 GHz at 410 GHz, respectively. The approach presented in this paper is
applicable to other optical elements that exhibit polarization rotation as a
function of frequency.

are thus highly sensitive to errors in background estimation. However, by
taking advantage of redundancy in the dataset map one can improve background
estimation and increase chemical sensitivity. We consider two such approaches-
linear combination of power laws and local background averaging-that reduce
background error and improve signal extraction. Principal components analysis
(PCA) can also be used to analyze spectrum images, but the poor
peak-to-background ratio in EELS can lead to serious artifacts if raw EELS data
is PCA filtered. We identify common artifacts and discuss alternative

scientific conduct are regulated and termed as ""good laboratory practice.""
Laboratory notebooks are used to record each step in conducting an experiment
and processing data. Originally, these notebooks were paper based. Due to
computerised research systems, acquired data became more elaborate, thus
increasing the need for electronic notebooks with data storage, computational
features and reliable electronic documentation. As a new approach to this, a
scientific data management system (DataFinder) is enhanced with features for
traceable documentation. Provenance recording is used to meet requirements of
traceability, and this information can later be queried for further analysis.
DataFinder has further important features for scientific documentation: It
employs a heterogeneous and distributed data storage concept. This enables
access to different types of data storage systems (e. g. Grid data
infrastructure, file servers). In this chapter we describe a number of building
blocks that are available or close to finished development. These components
are intended for assembling an electronic laboratory notebook for use in Grid
environments, while retaining maximal flexibility on usage scenarios as well as
maximal compatibility overlap towards each other. Through the usage of such a
system, provenance can successfully be used to trace the scientific workflow of
preparation, execution, evaluation, interpretation and archiving of research
data. The reliability of research results increases and the research process
remains transparent to remote research partners.

a Standard Model-like Higgs boson at a mass of approximately 125 GeV. In this
paper, we explore the potential consequences for the MSSM and low scale
SUSY-breaking. As is well-known, a 125 GeV Higgs implies either extremely heavy
stops (>~ 10 TeV), or near-maximal stop mixing. We review and quantify these
statements, and investigate the implications for models of low-scale SUSY
breaking such as gauge mediation where the A-terms are small at the messenger
scale. For such models, we find that either a gaugino must be superheavy or the
NLSP is long-lived. Furthermore, stops will be tachyonic at high scales. These
are very strong restrictions on the mediation of supersymmetry breaking in the
MSSM, and suggest that if the Higgs truly is at 125 GeV, viable models of
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking are reduced to small corners of parameter
space or must incorporate new Higgs-sector physics.

formation in their host galaxies. In particular, at high redshift, models
expect that feedback associated with quasar-driven outflows is so efficient
that the gas in the host galaxy is largely swept away or heated up, hence
suppressing star formation in massive galaxies. We observationally investigate
this phenomenon by using VLT-SINFONI integral field spectroscopy of the
luminous quasar 2QZJ002830.4-281706 at z=2.4. The spectra sample the optical

detection of narrow Halpha emission reveals star formation in the quasar host
galaxy, with SFR=100 Msun/yr. However, the star formation is not distributed
uniformly, but is strongly suppressed in the region with the highest outflow
velocity and highest velocity dispersion. This result indicates that star
formation in this region is strongly quenched by the quasar outflow, which is
cleaning the galaxy disk of its molecular gas. This is one of the first direct
observational proofs of quasar feedback quenching the star formation at high

the joint probability $p_{XY}$ of two random variables X and Y and the
conditional probability $p_{X|Y=y^*}$, with $y^*=<Y>$ according to $p_{XY}$.
The stochastic free energies of the XY system (fluctuating Y ensemble) and the
$X|Y$ system (fixed Y ensemble) are related by the chain rule for relative
entropy. In the thermodynamic limit, defined as $V,Y\to\infty$ (where one
assumes Y as an extensive quantity, while V denotes the system size parameter),
the marginal probability obeys $p_Y(y)\to \exp(-V\phi(z))$ with $z=y/V$. A
conjugate variable $\mu=-\phi(z)/z$ naturally emerges from this result. The
stochastic free energies of the fluctuating and fixed ensembles are then
related by $F_{XY}=F_{X|Y=y^*}-\mu y^*$, with $\mu=\partial F_{X|Y=y}/\partial
y$. The time evolutions for the two free energies are the same:
$d[F_{XY}(t)]/dt=\partial [F_{X|Y=y^*(t)}(t)]/ \partial t$. This mathematical
theory is applied to systems with fixed and fluctuating number of identical
independent random variables (idea gas), as well as to microcanonical systems

the Newton's law of purely classical gravity yet the key assumptions of this

phenomena in physics, where the underlying, more fundamental physics often

naturally wonders: where is hbar hiding in entropic gravity? To address this
question, we first revisit the idea of holographic screen as well as entropy
and its variation law in order to obtain a self-consistent approach to the
problem. Next we argue that when dealing with quantum gravity issues the
generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) should be the more appropriate
foundation. Indeed based on GUP it has been demonstrated that the black hole
Bekenstein entropy area law must be modified not only in the strong but also in
the weak gravity regime. In the weak gravity limit, such a GUP modified entropy
exhibits a logarithmic correction term. When applying it to the entropic
interpretation, we demonstrate that the resulting gravity force law does
include sub-leading order correction terms that depend on hbar. Such deviation
from the classical Newton's law may serve as a probe to the validity of the

insight into the electrostatic physics underlying the response of the highly
positively charged S4 transmembrane domain to changes in membrane potential and
other electrostatic parameters. By calculating the partition function computed
from the electrostatic energy over translational and/or rotational degrees of
freedom, I compute expectations of charge displacement, energetics, probability
distributions of translation & rotation and Maxwell stress for arrangements of
S4 positively charged residues; these computations can then be compared with
experimental results to elucidate the role of various putative atomic level
features of the VS. A `paddle' model is rejected on electrostatic grounds,
owing to unfavorable energetics, insufficient charge displacement and excessive
Maxwell stress. On the other hand, a `sliding helix' model with three local
counter-charges, a protein dielectric coefficient of 4 and a 2/3 interval of
counter-charge positioning relative to the S4-helix period of positive residues
is electrostatically reasonable, comparing well with Shaker (Seoh et al.,
1996). Lack of counter-charges destabilizes the S4 in the membrane;
counter-charge interval helps determine the number and shape of energy barriers
and troughs over the range of motion of the S4; and the local dielectric
coefficient of the protein constrains the height of energy maxima. These
`sliding helix' models compare favorably with experimental results for single &
double mutant charge experiments on Shaker. Single S4 positive charge mutants
are predicted quite well by this model; single counter-charge mutants are
predicted less well; and double mutants for both an S4 charge and a
counter-charge are characterized least well.

the following test-space characterization obtained in M.I. Ostrovskii
[Different forms of metric characterizations of classes of Banach spaces,
Houston J. Math., to appear]:
  For each sequence $\{X_m\}_{m=1}^\infty$ of finite-dimensional Banach spaces
there is a sequence $\{H_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ of finite connected unweighted
graphs with maximum degree 3 such that the following conditions on a Banach
space $Y$ are equivalent:
  (A) $Y$ admits uniformly isomorphic embeddings of $\{X_m\}_{m=1}^\infty$;
  (B) $Y$ admits uniformly bilipschitz embeddings of $\{H_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$.
  The second part of the paper is devoted to the case when
$\{X_m\}_{m=1}^\infty$ is an increasing sequence of spaces. It is shown that in
this case the class of spaces given by (A) can be characterized using one
test-space, which can be chosen to be an infinite graph with maximum degree 3.

sunward-flowing voids are often seen above developing post-eruption arcades.
First discovered using the soft X-ray telescope aboard Yohkoh, these
supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are now an expected observation of extreme
ultra-violet (EUV) and soft X-ray coronal imagers and spectrographs (e.g,
TRACE, SOHO/SUMER, Hinode/XRT, SDO/AIA). Observations made prior to the
operation of AIA suggested that these plasma voids (which are seen in contrast
to bright, high-temperature plasma associated with current sheets) are the
cross-sections of evacuated flux tubes retracting from reconnection sites high
in the corona. The high temperature imaging afforded by AIA's 131, 94, and 193
Angstrom channels coupled with the fast temporal cadence allows for
unprecedented scrutiny of the voids. For a flare occurring on 2011 October 22,
we provide evidence suggesting that SADs, instead of being the cross-sections
of relatively large, evacuated flux tubes, are actually wakes (i.e., trailing
regions of low density) created by the retraction of much thinner tubes. This
re-interpretation is a significant shift in the fundamental understanding of
SADs, as the features once thought to be identifiable as the shrinking loops
themselves now appear to be ""side effects"" of the passage of the loops through
the supra-arcade plasma. In light of the fact that previous measurements have
attributed to the shrinking loops characteristics that may instead belong to
their wakes, we discuss the implications of this new interpretation on previous
parameter estimations, and on reconnection theory.

in three dimensions (using spectroscopic data cubes) with Duchamp, the standard

different sets of unresolved and extended HI model sources. These models were
then fed into Duchamp, using a range of different parameters and methods
provided by the software. The main aim of the tests was to study the
performance of Duchamp on sources with different parameters and morphologies
and assess the accuracy of Duchamp's source parametrisation. Overall, we find
Duchamp to be a powerful source finder capable of reliably detecting sources
down to low signal-to-noise ratios and accurately measuring their position and
velocity. In the presence of noise in the data, Duchamp's measurements of basic
source parameters, such as spectral line width and integrated flux, are
affected by systematic errors. These errors are a consequence of the effect of
noise on the specific algorithms used by Duchamp for measuring source
parameters in combination with the fact that the software only takes into
account pixels above a given flux threshold and hence misses part of the flux.
In scientific applications of Duchamp these systematic errors would have to be
corrected for. Alternatively, Duchamp could be used as a source finder only,
and source parametrisation could be done in a second step using more
sophisticated parametrisation algorithms.

would have been prevented by a regulation that was repealed by the Securities

designed to prevent manipulation and promote stability and was in force from
1938 as a key part of the government response to the 1929 market crash and its
aftermath. On November 1, 2007, Citigroup experienced an unusual increase in
trading volume and decrease in price. Our analysis of financial industry data
shows that this decline coincided with an anomalous increase in borrowed
shares, the selling of which would be a large fraction of the total trading
volume. The selling of borrowed shares cannot be explained by news events as
there is no corresponding increase in selling by share owners. A similar number
of shares were returned on a single day six days later. The magnitude and
coincidence of borrowing and returning of shares is evidence of a concerted
effort to drive down Citigroup's stock price and achieve a profit, i.e., a bear
raid. Interpretations and analyses of financial markets should consider the
possibility that the intentional actions of individual actors or coordinated
groups can impact market behavior. Markets are not sufficiently transparent to
reveal even major market manipulation events. Our results point to the need for
regulations that prevent intentional actions that cause markets to deviate from
equilibrium and contribute to crashes. Enforcement actions cannot reverse
severe damage to the economic system. The current ""alternative"" uptick rule
which is only in effect for stocks dropping by over 10% in a single day is
insufficient. Prevention may be achieved through improved availability of
market data and the original uptick rule or other transaction limitations.

of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems. In this paper, we
investigate joint source and relay precoding design based on the
mean-square-error (MSE) criterion in MIMO two-way relay systems, where two
multi-antenna source nodes exchange information via a multi-antenna
amplify-and-forward relay node. This problem is non-convex and its optimal
solution remains unsolved. Aiming to find an efficient way to solve the
problem, we first decouple the primal problem into three tractable
sub-problems, and then propose an iterative precoding design algorithm based on
alternating optimization. The solution to each sub-problem is optimal and
unique, thus the convergence of the iterative algorithm is guaranteed.
Secondly, we propose a structured precoding design to lower the computational
complexity. The proposed precoding structure is able to parallelize the
channels in the multiple access (MAC) phase and broadcast (BC) phase. It thus
reduces the precoding design to a simple power allocation problem. Lastly, for
the special case where only a single data stream is transmitted from each
source node, we present a source-antenna-selection (SAS) based precoding design
algorithm. This algorithm selects only one antenna for transmission from each
source and thus requires lower signalling overhead. Comprehensive simulation is
conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of all the proposed precoding designs.

power spectrum and are a standard rod to measure the cosmological expansion.
These have been studied in Cartesian space (Fourier or real space) or in
Spherical Harmonic (SH) space in thin shells. Future wide-field surveys will
cover both wide and deep regions of the sky and thus require a simultaneous
treatment of the spherical sky and of an extended radial coverage. The
Spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) decomposition is a natural basis for the
analysis of fields in this geometry and facilitates the combination of BAO
surveys with other cosmological probes readily described in this basis. We
present here a new way to analyse BAOs by studying the BAO wiggles from the SFB
power spectrum. In SFB space, the power spectrum generally has both a radial
(k) and tangential (l) dependence and so do the BAOs. In the deep survey limit
and ignoring evolution, the SFB power spectrum becomes radial and reduces to
the Cartesian Fourier power spectrum. In the limit of a thin shell, all the
information is contained in the tangential modes described by the 2D SH power
spectrum. We find that the radialisation of the SFB power spectrum is still a
good approximation even when considering an evolving and biased galaxy field
with a finite selection function. This effect can be observed by all-sky
surveys with depths comparable to current surveys. We find that the BAOs
radialise more rapidly than the full SFB power spectrum. Our results suggest
the first peak of the BAOs in SFB space becomes radial out to l ~ 10 for
all-sky surveys with the same depth as SDSS or 2dF, and out to l ~ 70 for an
all-sky stage IV survey. Subsequent BAO peaks also become radial, but for
shallow surveys these may be in the non-linear regime. For modes that have
become radial, measurements at different l's are useful in practice to reduce
measurement errors.

via a boundary layer that forms near the object's surface, in which the
rotation speed of the accreted gas changes rapidly. Here we study the initial
stages of formation for such a boundary layer around a white dwarf or a young
star by examining the hydrodynamical shear instabilities that may initiate
mixing and momentum transport between the two fluids of different densities
moving supersonically with respect to each other. We find that an initially
laminar boundary layer is unstable to two different kinds of instabilities. One
is an instability of a supersonic vortex sheet (implying a discontinuous
initial profile of the angular speed of the gas) in the presence of gravity,
which we find to have a growth rate of order (but less than) the orbital
frequency. The other is a sonic instability of a finite width, supersonic shear
layer, which is similar to the Papaloizou-Pringle instability. It has a growth
rate proportional to the shear inside the transition layer, which is of order
the orbital frequency times the ratio of stellar radius to the boundary layer
thickness. For a boundary layer that is thin compared to the radius of the
star, the shear rate is much larger than the orbital frequency. Thus, we
conclude that sonic instabilities play a dominant role in the initial stages of
nonmagnetic boundary layer formation and give rise to very fast mixing between
disk gas and stellar fluid in the supersonic regime.

complex organics were created in situ by ultraviolet light from nearby O/B
stars irradiating ices already in the Sun's protoplanetary disk. If the Sun was
born in a dense cluster near UV-bright stars, the flux hitting the disk from
external stars could be many orders of magnitude higher than that from the Sun
alone. Such photolysis of ices in the laboratory can rapidly produce amino acid
precursors and other complex organic molecules. I present a simple model
coupling grain growth and UV exposure in a young circumstellar disk. It is
shown that the production may be sufficient to create the Solar System's entire
complex organic inventory within 10^6 years. Subsequent aqueous alteration on

on the number of measurements, their precision and their accuracy. The accuracy
of past measurements is gauged by comparison with the WMAP7 results. The 637

techniques used to carry them out into 12 different categories. We find that
the number of published measurements per year in all 12 cases except for the
dark energy equation of state parameter w_0 peaked between 1995 and 2004. Of
the individual techniques, only BAO measurements were still rising in
popularity at the end of the studied time period. The fractional error
associated with most measurements has been declining relatively slowly, with
several parameters, such as the amplitude of mass fluctutations sigma_8 and the
Hubble constant H_0 remaining close to the 10% precision level for a 10-15 year
period. The accuracy of recent parameter measurements is generally what would
be expected given the quoted error bars, although before the year 2000, the
accuracy was significantly worse, consistent with an average underestimate of
the error bars by a factor of ~2. When used as complement to traditional
forecasting techniques, our results suggest that future measurements of
parameters such as fNL, and w_a will have been informed by the gradual
improvment in understanding and treatment of systematic errors and are likely
to be accurate. However, care must be taken to avoid the effects of
confirmation bias, which may be affecting recent measurements of dark energy

novel second-order approximation for ATM option prices under the CGMY L\'evy
model is derived, and then extended to a model with an additional independent
Brownian component. Our results shed light on the connection between both the
volatility of the continuous component and the jump parameters and the behavior
of ATM option prices near expiration. In case of an additional Brownian
component, the second-order term, in time-t, is of the form $ d_{2}
t^{(3-Y)/2}$, with the coefficient $d_{2}$ depending only on the overall jump
intensity parameter C and the tail-heaviness parameter Y. This extends the
known result that the leading term is $(\sigma/\sqrt{2\pi})t^{1/2}$, where
$\sigma$ is the volatility of the continuous component. In contrast, under a
pure-jump CGMY model, the dependence on the two parameters C and Y is already
reflected in the leading term, which is of the form $d_{1} t^{1/Y}$.
Information on the relative frequency of negative and positive jumps appears
only in the second-order term, which is shown to be of the form $d_{2} t$ and
whose order of decay turns out to be independent of Y. The third-order
asymptotic behavior of the option prices as well as the asymptotic behavior of
the corresponding Black-Scholes implied volatilities are also addressed. Our
numerical results show that in most cases the second-order term significantly
outperform the first-order approximation.

wind nebula may dominate its spectrum up to gamma-ray energies. Because of the
short cooling time of the gamma-ray emitting electrons, the gamma-ray emission
zone is in the immediate vicinity of the acceleration site. The particle
acceleration likely occurs at the termination shock of the relativistic striped
wind, where multiple forced magnetic field reconnections provide strong
magnetic fluctuations facilitating Fermi acceleration processes. The
acceleration mechanisms imply the presence of stochastic magnetic fields in the
particle acceleration region, which cause stochastic variability of the
synchrotron emission. This variability is particularly strong in the steep
gamma-ray tail of the spectrum, where modest fluctuations of the magnetic field
lead to strong flares of spectral flux. In particular, stochastic variations of
magnetic field, which may lead to quasi-cyclic gamma-ray flares, can be
produced by the relativistic cyclotron ion instability at the termination
shock. Our model calculations of the spectral and temporal evolution of
synchrotron emission in the spectral cut-off regime demonstrate that the
intermittent magnetic field concentrations dominate the gamma-ray emission from
highest energy electrons and provide fast, strong variability even for a
quasi-steady distribution of radiating particles. The simulated light curves
and spectra can explain the very strong gamma-ray flares observed in the Crab
nebula and the lack of strong variations at other wavelengths. The model
predicts high polarization in the flare phase, which can be tested with future
polarimetry observations.

Diversity in traits is necessary for adaptation and can influence the survival
of a population faced with novelty. In habitats that remain stable over many
generations, stabilizing selection reduces trait differences within
populations, thereby appearing to remove the diversity needed for heritable
adaptive responses in new environments. Paradoxically, field studies have
documented numerous populations under long periods of stabilizing selection and
evolutionary stasis that have rapidly evolved under changed environmental
conditions. In this article, we review how cryptic genetic variation (CGV)
resolves this diversity paradox by allowing populations in a stable environment
to gradually accumulate hidden genetic diversity that is revealed as trait
differences when environments change. Instead of being in conflict,
environmental stasis supports CGV accumulation and thus appears to facilitate
rapid adaptation in new environments as suggested by recent CGV studies.
Similarly, degeneracy has been found to support both genetic and non-genetic
adaptation at many levels of biological organization. Degenerate, as opposed to
diverse or redundant, ensembles appear functionally redundant in certain
environmental contexts but functionally diverse in others. CGV and degeneracy
paradigms for adaptation are integrated in this review, revealing a common set
of principles that support adaptation at multiple levels of biological
organization. Though a discussion of simulation studies, molecular-based
experimental systems, principles from population genetics, and field
experiments, we demonstrate that CGV and degeneracy reflect complementary
top-down and bottom-up, respectively, conceptualizations of the same basic
phenomenon and arguably capture a universal feature of biological adaptive
processes.

terms of the 3D spatial density parameters for a wide range of the shape

observations of galaxies and clusters whose total spatial (3D) density
distributions are believed to be Einasto-like. Further, given the dependence of
our model on the 3D parameters, one can reliably estimate structural parameters
of the spatial (3D) density from 2D observations. We also consider a
Sersic-like parametrization for the above family of projected Einasto profiles

systems whose existence must be verified spectroscopically. While such central
excess components are not necessarily contrary to the notion of a mass deficit

indicating an universality in the functional form of the 3D density of light in

potential, plays a crucial role in the formation of large scale structures.
Hence, considerable analytic work has been based on the joint distribution of
its eigenvalues, associated with Gaussian statistics. In addition, directly
related morphological quantities such as ellipticity or prolateness are
essential tools in understanding the formation and structural properties of
halos, voids, sheets and filaments, their relation with the local environment,
and the geometrical and dynamical classification of the cosmic web. To date,
most analytic work has been focused on Doroshkevich's unconditional formulae
for the eigenvalues of the linear tidal field, which neglect the fact that
halos (voids) may correspond to maxima (minima) of the density field. I present
here new formulae for the constrained eigenvalues of the initial shear field
associated with Gaussian statistics, which include the fact that those
eigenvalues are related to regions where the source of the displacement is
positive (negative): this is achieved by requiring the Hessian matrix of the
displacement field to be positive (negative) definite. The new conditional
formulae naturally reduce to Doroshkevich's unconditional relations, in the
limit of no correlation between the potential and the density fields. As a
direct application, I derive the individual conditional distributions of
eigenvalues and point out the connection with previous literature. Finally, I

that are represented by the atomic tight-binding (TB) and continuum k\cdotp
(KP) band model. It is shown that the methodology to approximate solutions of
open systems which has been already reported for the single-band effective mass
model, cannot be directly used for atomic TB systems, since the use of a set of
zincblende crystal grids makes the inter-coupling matrix be non-invertible. We
derive and test an alternative with which the CBR method can be still practical
in solving TB systems. This multi-band CBR method is validated by a proof of
principles on small systems, and also shown to work excellent with the KP
approach. Further detailed analysis on the accuracy, speed, and scalability on
high performance computing clusters, is performed with respect to the reference
results obtained by the state-of- the-art Recursive Green's Function and
Wavefunction algorithm. This work shows that the CBR method could be
particularly useful in calculating resonant tunneling features, but show a
limited practicality in simulating field effect transistors (FETs) when the
system is described with the atomic TB model. Coupled to the KP model, however,
the utility of the CBR method can be extended to simulations of nanowire FETs.

bright arc (""aureole""). Those historical visual observations allowed inferring
the existence of Venus' atmosphere, the bright arc being correctly ascribed to
the refraction of light by the outer layers of a dense atmosphere. On June 8th,
2004, fast photometry based on electronic imaging devices allowed the first
quantitative analysis of the phenomenon. Several observers used a variety of
acquisition systems to image the event -- ranging from amateur-sized to
professional telescopes and cameras -- thus collecting for the first time a
large amount of quantitative information on this atmospheric phenomenon. In
this paper, after reviewing some elements brought by the historical records, we
give a detailed report of the ground based observations of the 2004 transit.
Besides confirming the historical descriptions, we perform the first
photometric analysis of the aureole using various acquisition systems. The
spatially resolved data provide measurements of the aureole flux as a function
of the planetocentric latitude along the limb. A new differential refraction
model of solar disk through the upper atmosphere allows us to relate the

temperature in the South polar region, as well as the latitudinal variation of
the cloud-top layer altitude. We compare our measurements to recent analysis of

Cosmic shear in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey","23 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables, Part 2 of 2; to be submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical weak lensing by large-scale structure -- cosmic shear -- is a
promising cosmological tool, which has motivated the design of several large
upcoming surveys. Here, we present a measurement of cosmic shear using coadded
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging in 168 square degrees of the equatorial
region, with r<23.5 and i<22.5, a source number density of 2.2 galaxies per
square arcminute and median redshift of 0.52. These coadds were generated using
a new method described in the companion Paper I that was intended to minimise
systematic errors in the lensing measurement due to coherent PSF anisotropies
that are otherwise prevalent in the SDSS imaging data. We present measurements
of cosmic shear out to angular separations of 2 degrees, along with systematics
tests that (combined with those from Paper I on the catalogue generation)
demonstrate that our results are dominated by statistical rather than
systematic errors. Assuming a cosmological model corresponding to WMAP7 and
allowing only the amplitude of matter fluctuations to vary, we find a best-fit
value of sigma_8=0.636 +0.109 -0.154 (1-sigma); without systematic errors this
would be sigma_8=0.636 +0.099 -0.137 (1-sigma). Assuming a flat LCDM model, the
combined constraints with WMAP7 are sigma_8=0.784 +0.028 -0.026 (1-sigma),
+0.055 -0.054 (2-sigma) and Omega_m h^2=0.1303 +0.0047 -0.0048 (1-sigma)+0.009
-0.009 (2-sigma); the 2-sigma error ranges are respectively 14 and 17 per cent
smaller than WMAP7 alone. Aside from the intrinsic value of such cosmological
constraints from the growth of structure, we identify some important lessons
for upcoming surveys that may face similar issues when combining multi-epoch
data to measure cosmic shear.

frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective

astronomy, and is making enormous contributions particularly to gamma-ray
pulsar science. As a result of the many new pulsar discoveries, the gamma-ray
pulsar population is now approaching 100. Some very famous millisecond pulsars
(MSPs) have also been detected: J1939+2134 (B1937+21), the first MSP ever
discovered, as well as J1959+2048 (B1957+20), the first black widow pulsar
system. These, along with other MSPs such as PSR J0034-0534 and J2214+3000, are
rare among the pulsar population in that they exhibit nearly phase-aligned
radio and gamma-ray light curves (LCs). Traditionally, pulsar LCs have been
modelled using standard HE models in conjunction with low-altitude conal beam
radio models. However, a different approach is needed to account for
phase-aligned LCs. We explored two scenarios: one where both the radio and
gamma-ray emission originate in the outer magnetosphere, and one where the
emission comes from near the polar caps (PCs) on the stellar surface. We find
best-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for the first
class of models. The first scenario seems to be somewhat preferred, as is also
hinted at by the radio polarization data. This implies that the phase-aligned
LCs are possibly of caustic origin produced in the outer magnetosphere, in
contrast to the usual lower-altitude conal beam radio models. Lastly, we
constrain the emission altitudes with typical uncertainties of ~10% of the
light cylinder radius. The modelled pulsars are members of a third gamma-ray
MSP subclass, in addition to two others with non-aligned radio and gamma-ray
LCs.

  Registration",,,,,"cs.CV cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To achieve sparse parametrizations that allows intuitive analysis, we aim to
represent deformation with a basis containing interpretable elements, and we
wish to use elements that have the description capacity to represent the
deformation compactly. To accomplish this, we introduce in this paper
higher-order momentum distributions in the LDDMM registration framework. While
the zeroth order moments previously used in LDDMM only describe local
displacement, the first-order momenta that are proposed here represent a basis
that allows local description of affine transformations and subsequent compact
description of non-translational movement in a globally non-rigid deformation.
The resulting representation contains directly interpretable information from
both mathematical and modeling perspectives. We develop the mathematical
construction of the registration framework with higher-order momenta, we show
the implications for sparse image registration and deformation description, and
we provide examples of how the parametrization enables registration with a very
low number of parameters. The capacity and interpretability of the
parametrization using higher-order momenta lead to natural modeling of
articulated movement, and the method promises to be useful for quantifying
ventricle expansion and progressing atrophy during Alzheimer's disease.

have not only on the structure of ordinary nuclei but on the structure of
hadronic matter at high densities as well. One of the ultimate aim of these
studies is the determination of the probability of two- and three-nucleon
correlations in nuclei. To this end, we have studied the possibility to extract
these probabilities from a novel analysis of inclusive A(e, e')X processes in
terms of relativistic scaling variables which incorporate effects from two- and
three-nucleon SRC, with a resulting scaling function strictly related to
longitudinal momentum distributions; such an approach led to a satisfactory
explanation of the cross section ratios recently found at JLab and interpreted
as strong evidence of SRC in nuclei.

boson mass in the range between 127 GeV to 600 GeV. With a fourth generation,
the excluded range is wider. To close the windows between 114 GeV to 127 GeV,
the mode $H \to \gamma\gamma$ plays an important role. There are evidences that
the Higgs boson mass is about 126 GeV from LHC data. $H\to \gamma\gamma$ can
occur at one loop level in the SM. In the SM with three generations (SM3), the
dominant contribution is from W boson with some cancellation from top quark in
the loop. With SM4, the large mass of the fourth generation quarks and charged
lepton cancel the W boson contribution significantly, the decay width is
suppressed by a factorin the range of 0.25 $\sim$ 0.55 for the fourth
generation mass in the range of 500 to 1000 GeV. This reduction factor makes
$\sigma(pp\to H X)Br(H\to \gamma \gamma)$ for SM4 comparable to that for SM3
for Higgs boson mass in the window allowed mentioned earlier. Using $H \to
\gamma \gamma$ alone, therefore, it is difficult at present to distinguish
whether the Higgs boson is from SM3 or SM4. We also comments on some other
detection channels.

star contamination and in the absence of follow-up astrometry, Bouvier et al.
tentatively concluded that the candidate companion was not physically

pair from adaptive optics imaging with the Palomar 5m telescope. Adaptive
optics spectroscopy with the integral field spectrograph OSIRIS on the Keck 10m
telescope reveals that the companion has a spectral type of M8\pm1. According
to substellar evolution models, the M8 spectral type resides within the
substellar mass regime at the age of the Pleiades. The primary itself is a
known double-lined spectroscopic binary, which makes the resolved companion,
HII 1348B, the least massive and widest component of this hierarchical triple
system and the first substellar companion to a stellar primary in the Pleiades.

Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) up to the ""knee"" in CR spectrum. During the
evolution of a SNR, the bulk of the CRs are confined inside the SNR shell. The
highest-energy particles leave the system continuously, while the remaining
adiabatically cooled particles are released when the SNR has expanded
sufficiently and decelerated so that the magnetic field at the shock is no
longer able to confine them. Particles escaping from the parent system may
interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing $\gamma$-rays in the process
via pion decay. The soft gamma-ray spectra observed for a number of SNRs
interacting with molecular clouds, however, challenge current theories of
non-linear particle acceleration that predict harder spectra. Aims. We study
how the spectrum of escaped particles depends on the time-dependent
acceleration history in both Type Ia and core-collapse SNRs, as well as on
different assumptions about the diffusion coefficient in the vicinity of the
SNR. Methods. We solve the CR transport equation in a test-particle approach
combined with numerical simulations of SNR evolution. Results. We extend our
method for calculating the cosmic-ray acceleration in SNRs to trace the escaped
particles in a large volume around SNRs. We calculate the evolution of the
spectra of CRs that have escaped from a SNR into a molecular cloud or dense
shell for two diffusion models. We find a strong confinement of CRs in a close
region around the SNR, and a strong dilution effect for CRs that were able to
propagate out as far as a few SNR radii.

e^{-(t-s)A}g(s)\,dW(s), \quad t\ge 0,$$ satisfies, for all $1\le p<\infty$, a
conical maximal $L^p$-regularity estimate $$\E \n \nabla u \n_{
T_2^{p,2}(\R_+\times\R^n)}^p \le C_p^p \E \n g \n_{
T_2^{p,2}(\R_+\times\R^n;H)}^p.$$ Here, $T_2^{p,2}(\R_+\times\R^n)$ and
$T_2^{p,2}(\R_+\times\R^n;H)$ are the parabolic tent spaces of real-valued and
$H$-valued functions, respectively. This contrasts with Krylov's maximal
$L^p$-regularity estimate $$\E \n \nabla u \n_{L^p(\R_+;L^2(\R^n;\R^n))}^p \le
C^p \E \n g \n_{L^p(\R_+;L^2(\R^n;H))}^p$$ which is known to hold only for
$2\le p<\infty$, even when $A = -\Delta$ and $H = \R$. The proof is based on an
$L^2$-estimate and extrapolation arguments which use the fact that $A$
satisfies suitable off-diagonal bounds. Our results are applied to obtain
conical stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity for a class of nonlinear SPDEs with
rough initial data.

aim is to combine approaches for solving a system of polynomial equations with
dual methods which involve moment matrices and semi-definite programming. While
the border basis algorithms of [17] are efficient and numerically stable for
computing complex roots, algorithms based on moment matrices [12] allow the
incorporation of additional polynomials, e.g., to re- strict the computation to
real roots or to eliminate multiple solutions. The proposed algorithm can be
used to compute a border basis of the input ideal and, as opposed to other
approaches, it can also compute the quotient structure of the (real) radical
ideal directly, i.e., without prior algebraic techniques such as Gr\""obner
bases. It thus combines the strength of existing algorithms and provides a
unified treatment for the computation of border bases for the ideal, the
radical ideal and the real radical ideal.

find that, especially at low metallicity, the production of r-process elements

this lighter elements primary process may be associated with massive stars.
[...] Our analysis reveals two types of core-collapse supernovae: one produces
mainly alpha-elements, the other produces both alpha-elements and Fe-peak
elements with a large enhancement of heavy Fe-peak elements which may be the

  approximant at arbitrary order","7 pages",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The inspiral of two compact objects in gravitational wave astronomy is
described by a post-Newtonian expansion in powers of $(v/c)$. In most cases, it
is believed that the post-Newtonian expansion is asymptotically divergent. A
standard technique for accelerating the convergence of a power series is to
re-sum the series by means of a rational polynomial called a Pad\'e
approximation. If we liken this approximation to a matrix, the best convergence
is achieved by staying close to a diagonal Pad\'e approximation. This broadly
presents two subsets of the approximation : a super-diagonal approximation
$P^M_N$ and a sub-diagonal approximation $P_M^N$, where $M = N+\epsilon$, and
$\epsilon$ takes the values of 0 or 1. Left as rational polynomials, the
coefficients in both the numerator and denominator need to be re-calculated as
the order of the initial power series approximation is increased. However, the
sub-diagonal Pad\'e approximant is computationally advantageous as it can be
expressed in terms of a Gauss-like continued fraction. Once in this form, each
coefficient in the continued fraction is uniquely determined at each order.
This means that as we increase the order of approximation of the original power
series, we now have only one new additional coefficient to calculate in the
continued fraction. While it is possible to provide explicit expressions for
the continued fraction coefficients, they rapidly become unwieldy at high
orders of approximation. It is also possible to numerically calculate the
coefficients by means of ratios of Hankel determinants. However, these
determinants can be ill-conditioned and lead to numerical instabilities. In
this article, we present a method for calculating the continued fraction
coefficients at arbitrary orders of approximation.

several models of surfaces, we obtain markedly different results from the
previously considered simplistic `perfect reflector' model, which is due to the
inclusion of physically important features of the surface like evanescent field

are paradoxical or otherwise unsatisfactory, prompting some authors to insist
that all priors be proper. This paper begins with the observation that an
improper measure on Theta satisfying Kingman's countability condition is in
fact a probability distribution on the power set. We show how to extend a model
in such a way that the extended parameter space is the power set. Under an
additional finiteness condition, which is needed for the existence of a
sampling region, the conditions for Bayes's theorem are satisfied by the
extension. Lack of interference ensures that the posterior distribution in the

concentrations should have declined during the Holocene in absence of humankind
activity, leading to glacial inception around the present. It partly relies on
the fact that present levels of northern summer incoming solar radiation are
close to those that, in the past, preceded a glacial inception phenomenon,
associated to declines in greenhouse gas concentrations. However, experiments
with various numerical models of glacial cycles show that next glacial
inception may still be delayed by several ten thousands of years, even with the
assumption of greenhouse gas concentration declines during the Holocene.
Furthermore, as we show here, conceptual models designed to capture the gross
dynamics of the climate system as a whole suggest also that small disturbances
may sometimes cause substantial delays in glacial events, causing a fair level
of unpredictability on ice age dynamics. This suggests the need of a validated
mathematical description of the climate system dynamics that allows us to
quantify uncertainties on predictions. Here, it is proposed to organise our
knowledge about the physics and dynamics of glacial cycles through a Bayesian
inference network. Constraints on the physics and dynamics of climate can be
encapsulated into a stochastic dynamical system. These constraints include, in
particular, estimates of the sensitivity of the components of climate to
external forcings, inferred from plans of experiments with large simulators of
the atmosphere, oceans and ice sheets. On the other hand, palaeoclimate
observations are accounted for through a process of parameter calibration. We
discuss promises and challenges raised by this programme.

other species up to S8, which are refractory at room temperature. A large

explore whether molecules may survive in an MHD disk wind invoked to reproduce
the kinematics and tentative rotation signatures of atomic jets in T Tauri
stars. The coupled ionization, chemical and thermal evolution along dusty flow
streamlines is computed for a prescribed MHD disk wind solution, using a method
developed for magnetized shocks in the interstellar medium. Irradiation by
wind-attenuated coronal X-rays and FUV photons from accretion hot spots is
included, with self-shielding of H2 and CO. Disk accretion rates of 5e-6, 1e-6
and 1e-7 solar masses per year are considered, representative of low-mass young
protostars (Class 0), evolved protostars (Class I) and very active T Tauri
stars (Class II). The disk wind has an onion-like thermo-chemical structure,
with streamlines launched from larger radii having lower temperature and
ionisation, and higher H2 abundance. The coupling between charged and neutral
fluids is sufficient to eject molecules from the disk out to 9 AU. The launch
radius beyond which most H2 survives moves outward with evolutionary stage. CO
survives in the Class 0 but is significantly photodissociated in the Class
I/II. Balance between ambipolar heating and molecular cooling establishes an
asymptotic temperature 700-3000 K, with cooler jets at earlier protostellar
stages. Endothermic formation of H2O is efficient with abundances up to 1e-4,
while CH+ and SH+ can exceed 1e-6 in the Class I/II winds. A centrifugal MHD
disk wind launched from beyond 0.2-1 AU can produce molecular jets/winds up to
speeds 100 km/s in young low-mass stars. The model predicts a high ratio H2/CO
and an increase of molecular launch radius, temperature, and flow width as the
source evolves, in agreement with current observed trends.

the scaling exponents and scaling functions corresponding to both regimes are

advance over traditional capture-recapture (CR) models because they yield
explicit estimates of animal density instead of population size within an
unknown area. Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for
heterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal
activity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is
gaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely
identified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop
models for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby
allowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked
populations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts
made on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample
units such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our
approach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and
uses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and
location of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates,
sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count
data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated
that while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5-10%
in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as
adequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population
substantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever
possible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an
unmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a
density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19-1.64) birds/ha. Our
paper challenges sampling and analytical conventions in ecology by
demonstrating that neither spatial independence nor individual recognition is
needed to estimate population density - rather, spatial dependence can be
informative about individual distribution and density.

almost regular lamellar phase, but high shear rates induce the nucleation and
proliferation of defects, which in steady state is balanced by the annihilation
of defects of opposite sign. The critical shear rate at onset of this second
regime is controlled by thermodynamic and kinetic parameters; we offer a
scaling analysis that relates the critical shear rate to a critical ""capillary
number"" involving those variables. Within the defect proliferation regime, the
defects may be partially annealed by slowly decreasing the applied shear rate;
this causes marked memory effects, and history-dependent rheology. Simulations
in three dimensions show instead shear-induced ordering even at the highest
shear rates studied here. This suggests that the critical shear rate shifts
markedly upward on increasing dimensionality. This may in part reflect the
reduced constraints on defect motion, allowing them to find and annihilate each
other more easily. Residual edge defects in the 3D aligned state mostly point
along the flow velocity, an orientation impossible in two dimensions.

this paper we derive a rigorous lower bound on the memory time $T_{mem}$ of the

Markovian master equation of Davies form, we prove that $T_{mem}\ge L^{c\beta}$

inverse temperature of the bath. However, this bound applies only if the
lattice size does not exceed certain critical value $L^*\sim e^{\beta/3}$. We

La$_{1.89}$Ce$_{0.11}$(Cu$_{0.99}$Co$_{0.01}$)O$_{4}$ (LCCO:Co) superconducting
thin films are investigated. When the external field $\bf H$ is applied along
the crystallographic c-axis, a double sign reversal of the Hall voltage in the
mixed state of LCCO:Co thin films is observed whereas a single sign reversal is
detected in LCCO. A double sign reversal of the Hall signal in LCCO can be
recovered if the magnetic field is tilted away from the plane of the film. We
find that the transition from one to two of the Hall sign reversal coincides
with the change in the pinning from strong to weak. This temperature/field
induced transition is caused either by the magnetic impurities in LCCO:Co or by
the coupling between the pancake vortices and the in-plane Josephson vortices
in LCCO. These results are in agreement with early theoretical and numerical
predictions.

cosmological parameters with respect to extragalactic sources and secondary
anisotropies contamination on small scales. We model with a minimal number of
parameters the expected dominant contaminations in intensity, such as
unresolved point sources and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The model
for unresolved point sources, either Poisson distributed or clustered, uses
data from Planck early results. The overall amplitude of these contributions
are included in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for the estimate of
cosmological parameters. We show that our method is robust: as long as the main
contaminants are taken into account the constraints on the cosmological
parameters are unbiased regardless of the realistic uncertainties on the
contaminants. We show also that the two parameters modelling unresolved points
sources are not prior dominated.

systems is recovered. The model of (quasi)-1D quantum Fermi liquid is developed
on the example of trans-polyacetylene and it is the generalization of
well-known model of organic (quasi)-1D conductors, elaborated by Su, Schrieffer
and Heeger (SSH-model). It is shown, that spin-charge separation effect can be
realized in (quasi)-1D quantum Fermi liquids. It has topological soliton origin
in distinction from spinon-holon spin-charge separation effect in
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids and electronic systems like them. The model allows
to extend the limits of the applicability of SSH-model to the electron-electron
correlated (quasi)-1D-systems without restriction on electron-electron
interaction force. The (quasi)-1D- systems with strong electron-phonon
interaction and/or strong electron-photon interaction can be also described
within the framework of given 1D quantum Fermi liquid model. Practical
significance of the model proposed consists in the clarification of the nature
of charge and spin carriers and in the clarification of the origin of
mechanisms of quasiparticles' interaction in the (quasi)-1D-systems, which are
the objects of nanoelectronics, spintronics and the other modern nanotechnology
branches.

published by the Canadian Mathematical Society. In the March 2010 issue(see
reference[1]) ,the following problem was proposed:Determine all positive
integers a,b, and c such that a^(b^c)=(a^b)^c; or equivalently,
a^(b^c)=a^(b^c). A solution by this author was published in the December2010
issue of Crux(see reference[2]). Accordingly, all such positive integer triples
are the following:The triples of the form (1,b,c); with b, c any positive
integers; the triples (a,b,1); a, b positive integers, with a being at least 2;
and the triples of the form (a,2,2); a being a positive integer not equal to
1.These are then the positive integer solutions to the 3-variable exponential
diophantine equation, x^(y^z)=x^(yz) (1) Motivated by mayhem problem M429, in
this work we investigate for more 3-variable exponential diophantine equations:
  x^(y^z)=x^(z^y) (2), x^(y^z)=y^(xz) (3) x^(yz)=y^(xz) (4), x^(y^z)=z^(xy) (5)
We completely determine the positive integer solution sets of equations (2),
(3), and (4). This is done in Theorems2,3, and4 respectively. We also find
three different families of solutions to equation (5); listed in Theorem5.

significantly reduce the detection threshold of seismic sources worldwide and
to improve the reliability of IDC arrivals by a more accurate estimation of
their defining parameters. More than ninety per cent of smaller REB events can
be built in automatic processing while completely fitting the REB event
definition criteria. The rate of false alarms, as compared to the events
rejected from the SEL3 in the current interactive processing, has also been
dramatically reduced by several powerful filters. The principal filter is the
difference of arrival times between the master events and newly built events at
three or more primary stations, which should lie in a narrow range of a few
seconds. Two effective pre-filters are f-k analysis and Fprob based on
correlation traces instead of original waveforms. As a result, cross
correlation may reduce the overall workload related to IDC interactive analysis
and provide a precise tool for quality check for both arrivals and events. Some
major improvements in automatic and interactive processing achieved by cross
correlation are illustrated by an aftershock sequence of a large continental
earthquake. Exploring this sequence, we describe schematically the next steps
for the development of a processing pipeline parallel to the existing IDC one
in order to improve the quality of the REB together with the reduction of the
magnitude threshold. The current IDC processing pipeline should be focused on
the events in areas without historical seismicity which are not properly
covered by REB events.
