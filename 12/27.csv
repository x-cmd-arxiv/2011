on two factors: (1) entanglement of chromophores, and (2) environmental noise.
While chromophores are conjugated $\pi$-bonding molecules with strongly
correlated electrons, previous models have treated this correlation implicitly
without a mathematical variable to gauge correlation-enhanced efficiency. Here
we generalize the single-electron/exciton models to a multi-electron/exciton
model that explicitly shows the effects of enhanced electron correlation within
chromophores on the efficiency of energy transfer. The model provides more
detailed insight into the interplay of electron correlation within chromophores
and electron entanglement between chromophores. Exploiting this interplay is
assisting in the design of new energy-efficient materials, which are just
beginning to emerge.

are extended to the case of a degenerate inner product. The main obstructions
to the extension of these operations to the degenerate case are (1) the index
lowering operation is not invertible, and (2) we cannot associate to the inner
product in a canonical way a reciprocal inner product on the dual of the vector
space. This article shows how these obstructions can be avoided naturally,
allowing a canonical definition of covariant contraction for some important
special cases.
  The primary motivation of this article is to lay down the algebraic
foundation for the construction of invariants in Singular Semi-Riemannian
Geometry, especially those related to the curvature. It turns out that the
operations discussed here are enough for this purpose (arXiv:1105.0201,

these invariants are crude and strongly dependent on the symmetry. Here we give
an unified picture of the relationship of the edge states and the geometry of

Ancient eclipses and planetary transits would permit to extend the knowledge of
the solar irradiance back to three centuries, through the parameter
W=dLogR/dLogL. The method of Baily's beads timing during eclipses is discussed,
and a significant improvement with respect to the last 40 years has been
obtained by reconstructing the Limb Darkening Function's inflexion point from
their light curve and the corresponding lunar valleys' profiles. The case of
the Jan 15, 2010 annular eclipse has been studied in detail, as well as the
last two transits of Venus. The atlas of Baily's beads, realized with worldwide
contributions by IOTA members is presented along with the solar diameter during
the eclipse of 2006. The transition between the photographic atlas of the lunar
limb (Watts, 1963) and the laser-altimeter map made by the Kaguya lunar probe
in 2009 has been followed. The other method for the accurate measurement of the
solar diameter alternative to the PICARD / PICARD-sol mission is the drift-scan
method used either by the solar astrolabes either by larger telescopes. The
observatories of Locarno and Paris have started an observational program of the
Sun with this method with encouraging results. For the first time an image
motion of the whole Sun has been detected at frequencies of 1/100 Hz. This may
start explain the puzzling results of the observational campaigns made in
Greenwich and Rome from 1850 to 1955. The meridian line of Santa Maria degli

didactically almost all the arguments of classical astrometry here presented.

Asteroseismology of DBV stars can provide valuable clues about the origin,

been discovered in the field of the \emph{Kepler} spacecraft. It is expected
that further monitoring of this star in the next years will enable astronomers
to determine its detailed asteroseismic profile. We perform an

DB white-dwarf models. We employ a complete set of evolutionary DB white-dwarf
structures covering a wide range of effective temperatures and stellar masses.
They have been obtained on the basis of a complete treatment of the
evolutionary history of progenitors stars. We compute g-mode adiabatic
pulsation periods for this set of models and compare them with the pulsation
properties exhibited by KIC 8626021. On the basis of the mean period spacing of
the star, we found that the stellar mass should be substantially larger than

asteroseismological model characterized by an effective temperature much higher
than the spectroscopic estimate. In agreement with a recent asteroseismological
analysis of this star by other authors, we conclude that KIC 8626021 is located
near the blue edge of the DBV instability strip, contrarily to spectroscopic
predictions. We also conclude that the mass of KIC 8626021 should be
substantially larger than thought.

experimentally observed plateau in force-stretching diagrams for some
macromolecules. This chain model involves the nearest-neighbor interaction of a
Morse-like potential (required to have a saturation branch) and an harmonic
second-neighbor coupling. Under an external stretching applied t o the chain
ends, the intersite Morse-like potential results in the appearance of a
double-well potential within each chain monomer, whereas the interaction
between the second neighbors provide s a homogeneous bistable (degenerate)
ground state, at least within a certain part of the chain.
  As a result, different conformational changes occur in the chain under the
external forcing. The transition regions between these conformations are
described as topological solitons. With a strong second-neighbor interaction,
the solitons describe the transition between the bistable ground states.
However, the key point of the model is the appearance of a heterogenous
structure, when the second-neighbor coupling is sufficiently weak. In this
case, a part of the chain has short bonds with a single-well potential, whereas
the complementary part admits strongly stretched bonds with a double-well
potential. This case allows us to explain the existence of a plateau in the
force-stretching diagram for DNA and alpha-helix protein. Finally, the soliton

Thermodynamically reciprocal hydrodynamic equations of motion are derived for
the DW responding to electronic spin torques, on the one hand, and fictitious
electromotive forces in the electronic chiral mode fomented by the DW, on the
other. An experimental realization illustrating this physics is proposed based
on a ferromagnetic strip, which cuts the topological insulator surface into two

transverse to the magnetic strip acts as a dissipative interconnect, which is
itself a dynamic object that controls (and, inversely, responds to) the

finite temperatures, taking into account the inhomogeneity of the dielectric
background of the system. The effective dielectric function is obtained from
the solution of the Poisson equation of three-layer dielectric medium with the
graphene sheets located at the interfaces, separating the different materials.
Due to the momentum dispersion of the effective dielectric function, the intra-
and inter-layer bare Coulomb interactions in the graphene double layer system
acquires an additional momentum dependence--an effect that is of the order of
the inter-layer interaction itself. We show that the energies of the in-phase
and out-of-phase plasmon modes are determined largely by different values of
the spatially dependent effective dielectric function. The effect of the
dielectric inhomogeneity increases with temperature and even at high
temperatures the energy shift induced by the dielectric inhomogeneity and
temperature itself remains larger than the broadening of the plasmon energy
dispersions due to the Landau damping. The obtained new features of the plasmon
dispersions can be observed in frictional drag measurements and in inelastic
light scattering and electron energy-loss spectroscopies.

spectroscopic imaging STM (SI-STM) has been to probe the electronic structure
of cuprate high temperature superconductors. In both the d-wave superconducting
(dSC) and the pseudogap (PG) phases of underdoped cuprates, two distinct
classes of electronic states are observed using SI-STM. The first class
consists of the dispersive Bogoliubov quasiparticles of a homogeneous d-wave
superconductor. These are detected below a lower energy scale |E|={\Delta}0 and
only upon a momentum space (k-space) arc which terminates near the lines
connecting k=\pm({\pi}/a0,0) to k=\pm(0, {\pi}/a0). In both the dSC and PG
phases, the only broken symmetries detected in the |E|\leq {\Delta}0 states are
those of a d-wave superconductor. The second class of states occurs at energies
near the pseudogap energy scale |E| {\Delta}1 which is associated
conventionally with the 'antinodal' states near k=\pm({\pi}/a0,0) and k=\pm(0,
{\pi}/a0). We find that these states break the 90o-rotational (C4) symmetry of
electronic structure within CuO2 unit cells, at least down to 180o rotational
(C2) symmetry (nematic) but in a spatially disordered fashion. This
intra-unit-cell C4 symmetry breaking coexists at |E| {\Delta}1 with
incommensurate conductance modulations locally breaking both rotational and
translational symmetries (smectic). The properties of these two classes of |E|
{\Delta}1 states are indistinguishable in the dSC and PG phases. To explain
this segregation of k-space into the two regimes distinguished by the
symmetries of their electronic states and their energy scales |E| {\Delta}1 and
|E|\leq{\Delta}0, and to understand how this impacts the electronic phase
diagram and the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, represents one of a key
challenges for cuprate studies.

only the targets of regulation, but are themselves likely signals that
coordinate developmental process. Yet, because it is difficult to directly

acting within and between cells. We model intracellular stress in terms of bulk
pressure and interfacial tension, allowing these parameters to vary from cell
to cell and from interface to interface. Assuming that epithelial cell layers
are close to mechanical equilibrium, we use the observed geometry of the two

While it has quite often been observed that Glauber dynamics lets the system be
stuck into an absorbing state distinct from its ground state in the
thermodynamic limit, very little is known about the likelihood of each
absorbing state. In order to explore the variety of absorbing states, we
investigate the probability distribution profile of the active link density
after saturation as the system size $N$ and $<k >$ vary. As a result, we find
that the distribution of absorbing states can be split into two self-averaging
peaks whose positions are determined by $<k>$, one slightly above the ground
state and the other farther away. Moreover, we suggest that the latter peak
accounts for a non-vanishing portion of samples when $N$ goes to infinity while
$<k >$ stays fixed. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our
results on opinion dynamics models.

compared to current IACTs, and the much larger effective area compared to

excellent photon statistics at multi-GeV energies. Employing a model of the GRB
population whose properties are broadly consistent with observations by the
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard Fermi, we
simulate follow-up observations of GRBs with the Large Size Telescopes (LSTs),
the component of CTA with the fastest slew speed and the best sensitivity at
energies below a few hundred GeV. For our fiducial assumptions, we foresee that
the LSTs can detect ~0.1 GRBs per year during the prompt phase and ~0.5 per
year in the afterglow phase, considering only one array site and both GBM and
the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) as the
alert instruments. The detection rates can be enhanced by a factor of about 5
and 6 for the prompt emission and the afterglow, respectively, assuming two
array sites with the same sensitivity and that the GBM localization error can
be reduced to less than 1 deg. The expected distribution of redshift and photon
counts are presented, showing that despite the modest event rate, hundreds or
more multi-GeV photons can be anticipated from a single burst once they are
detected. We also study how the detection rate depends on the intrinsic GRB
properties and the delay time between the burst trigger and the follow-up
observation.

phase diagrams where the number of Weyl fermions and their topological charge
are tunable via the plaquette fluxes. The Weyl semimetal state is shown to be
the intermediate phase between non-topological semimetal and quantum anomalous
Hall insulator. The transitions between those phases can be understood through
the evolution of the Weyl points as Berry flux insertion processes. As the Weyl

Networks have constantly been in the focus of research for the last decade,
with considerable advances in the description of their structural and dynamical
properties. However, much less effort has been devoted to studying the
controllability of the dynamics taking place on them. Here we introduce and
evaluate a dynamical process defined on the edges of a network, and demonstrate
that the controllability properties of this process significantly differ from
simple nodal dynamics. Evaluation of real-world networks indicates that most of
them are more controllable than their randomized counterparts. We also find
that transcriptional regulatory networks are particularly easy to control.
Analytic calculations show that networks with scale-free degree distributions
have better controllability properties than uncorrelated networks, and

relativistic jets that puncture the envelope of a collapsing star, and produced
the \gamma-rays after they break out. This model provides a theoretical
framework for the well known association between LGRBs and massive stars.
However although this association is supported by a wealth of observations, to
this date there is no direct observational evidence for the emergence of the
jet from the star. In other words there is no direct evidence for the Collapsar
model. Here we show that a distinct signature of the Collapsar model is the
appearance of a plateau in the duration distribution of the prompt GRB emission
at times much shorter than the typical breakout time of the jet. This plateau
is evident in the data of all major GRB satellites, and provides a direct
evidence supporting the Collapsar model. It also enables us to place limits on
the sizes and masses of LGRB progenitors; suggests the existence of a large
population of choked (failed) GRBs; and indicates that the 2 s duration
commonly used to separate Collapsars and non-Collapsars holds for BATSE and
possibly Fermi GBM GRBs, but it is inconsistent with the duration distributions
of Swift GRBs.

non-positivity of the potential leads to the fact that on some stage of

(0.6-0.8 r200), the temperature shows a remarkable drop from about 4.7 keV to
1.3 keV. This is a clear evidence that the radio relic really corresponds to a
shock front possibly caused by a past major merger. The observed sharp changes
of the temperature and electron density indicate the Mach number M~3. The
radial entropy profile is flatter than the prediction (r^1.1) of numerical
simulations within 0.5 r200}, and becomes steeper around the relic region.
These observed features and time-scale estimation consistently imply that the

order-preserving positively homogeneous self-maps of cones in Banach spaces. We
give conditions that guarantee that all these notions lead to the same value.
In particular, we give a Collatz-Wielandt type formula, which characterizes the
growth rate of the orbits in terms of eigenvectors in the closed cone or
super-eigenvectors in the interior of the cone. This characterization holds
when the cone is normal and when a quasi-compactness condition, involving an
essential spectral radius defined in terms of $k$-set-contractions, is
satisfied. Some fixed point theorems for non-linear maps on cones are derived
as intermediate results. We finally apply these results to show that non-linear
spectral radii commute with respect to suprema and infima of families of order
preserving maps satisfying selection properties.

selection in the Bayesian context. It is especially crucial to have good
estimates when assessing the number of planets orbiting stars when the models
explain the noisy data with different numbers of Keplerian signals. We
introduce a simple method for approximating the marginal likelihoods in
practice when a statistically representative sample from the parameter
posterior density is available.
  We use our truncated posterior mixture estimate to receive accurate model
probabilities for models with differing number of Keplerian signals in radial
velocity data. We test this estimate in simple scenarios to assess its accuracy
and rate of convergence in practice when the corresponding estimates calculated
using deviance information criterion can be applied to receive trustworthy
results for reliable comparison. As a test case, we determine the posterior
probability of a planet orbiting HD 3651 given Lick and Keck radial velocity
data.
  The posterior mixture estimate appears to be a simple and an accurate way of
calculating marginal integrals from posterior samples. We show, that it can be
used to estimate the marginal integrals reliably in practice, given a suitable
selection of parameter \lambda, that controls its accuracy and convergence
rate. It is also more accurate than the one block Metropolis-Hastings estimate
and can be used in any application because it is not based on assumptions on
the nature of the posterior density nor the amount of data or parameters in the
statistical model.

heavy element abundance offset of +0.13\pm0.07 dex for the H I deficient

algorithm to detect search points with potential to be local optima; and (ii) a

easier to reach and harder to leave by a slow adaptive walker. A slow adaptive
walker moves to a nearest fitter point. Thus, points with larger outgoing step
sizes relative to incoming step sizes are marked using the local optima score
formulae as potential local optima points (PLOPs). Defining local optima in
these more general terms allows their detection within the closure of a subset
of a search space, and the sampling of a search space unshackled by a
particular move set. Tests are done with NK and HIFF problems to confirm that
PLOPs detected in the manner proposed retain characteristics of local optima,
and that the adjusted Wang-Landau samples are more representative of the search
space than samples produced by choosing points uniformly at random. While our
approach shows promise, more needs to be done to reduce its computation cost
