formation of dispersive shocks in a class of Hamiltonian dispersive
regularizations of the quasilinear transport equation. The regularizations are
characterized by two arbitrary functions of one variable, where the condition
of integrability implies that one of these functions must not vanish. It is
shown numerically for a large class of equations that the local behaviour of
their solution near the point of gradient catastrophe for the transport
equation is described locally by a special solution of a Painlev\'e-type
equation. This local description holds also for solutions to equations where
blow up can occur in finite time. Furthermore, it is shown that a solution of
the dispersive equations away from the point of gradient catastrophe is
approximated by a solution of the transport equation with the same initial
data, modulo terms of order $\epsilon^2$ where $\epsilon^2$ is the small
dispersion parameter. Corrections up to order $\epsilon^4 $ are obtained and
tested numerically.

first level of neural integration, the antennal lobe (AL). The phasic-tonic
stimulus-response dynamics observed in the neural population code and in the
firing rate profiles of single neurons is faithfully captured by two
alternative models which rely either on short-term synaptic depression, or on
spike frequency adaptation. Both mechanisms work independently and possibly in
parallel to lateral inhibition. Short response latencies in local interneurons
indicate that local processing within the AL network relies on fast lateral

proliferation of emerging online social communities, such as online communities
formed through social networking services. Providing incentives for cooperation
in social communities is particularly challenging because of their unique
features: a large population of anonymous agents interacting infrequently,
having asymmetric interests, and dynamically joining and leaving the community;
operation errors; and low-cost reputation whitewashing. In this paper, taking
these features into consideration, we propose a framework for the design and
analysis of a class of incentive schemes based on a social norm, which consists
of a reputation scheme and a social strategy. We first define the concept of a
sustainable social norm under which every agent has an incentive to follow the
social strategy given the reputation scheme. We then formulate the problem of
designing an optimal social norm, which selects a social norm that maximizes
overall social welfare among all sustainable social norms. Using the proposed
framework, we study the structure of optimal social norms and the impacts of
punishment lengths and whitewashing on optimal social norms. Our results show
that optimal social norms are capable of sustaining cooperation, with the
amount of cooperation varying depending on the community characteristics.

is different. The transition starts at Tc,on comp = 65,3 K and reaches zero

penetrates the whole superconducting Bi-Pb-Sb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O sample so that there
is no region of pure superconducting material left. Since the materials do not
actually mix (see text) the behaviour might be attributable to the interface.
Also the resistivity curves present a very interesting feature, i.e., below the
temperature at which the composite attains zero-resistivity, a re-entrant
behaviour manifests itself and a finite resistivity peak appears. It increases
to a certain value to drop back to zero at some temperature below. We comment
further on this feature in the text.

material to the interstellar medium (ISM) and generates the hot ionized medium,
the ISM's high-temperature component. The evolution of superbubble energy
budgets is not well understood, however, and the processes responsible for
enhanced X-ray emission in superbubbles remain a matter of debate. We present
Chandra ACIS-S observations of two X-ray-bright superbubbles in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), DEM L50 (N186) and DEM L152 (N44), with an emphasis on
disentangling the true superbubble X-ray emission from non-related diffuse
emission and determining the spatial origin and spectral variation of the X-ray
emission. An examination of the superbubble energy budgets shows that on the
order of 50% of the X-ray emission comes from regions associated with supernova
remnant (SNR) impacts. We find some evidence of mass-loading due to swept-up
clouds and metallicity enrichment, but neither mechanism provides a significant
contribution to the X-ray luminosities. We also find that one of the
superbubbles, DEM L50, is likely not in collisional ionization equilibrium. We
compare our observations to the predictions of the standard Weaver et al. model
and to 1-D hydrodynamic simulations including cavity supernova impacts on the
shell walls. Our observations show that mass-loading due to thermal evaporation
from the shell walls and SNR impacts are the dominant source of enhanced X-ray
luminosities in superbubbles. These two processes should affect most
superbubbles, and their contribution to the X-ray luminosity must be considered
when determining the energy available for transport to the ISM.

It is shown that different choices for the energy variable in the dipole cross
section used in the literature are not related to each other by simple
arguments equating the typical dipole size and the inverse photon virtuality,
contrary to what is often stated. We argue that the good quality of fits to
structure functions that use Bjorken-x as the energy variable - which is
strictly speaking not justified in the dipole picture - can instead be
understood as a consequence of the sign of scaling violations that occur for
increasing Q^2 at fixed small x. We show that the dipole formula for massless
quarks has the structure of a convolution. From this we obtain derivative
relations between the structure function F_2 at large and small Q^2 and the
dipole-proton cross section at small and large dipole size r, respectively.

networks, which is to let all nodes broadcast information to and receive
information from their respective one-hop neighboring nodes. The contribution
is two-fold. First, as each neighbor selects one message-bearing codeword from
its unique codebook for transmission, it is shown that decoding their messages
based on a superposition of those codewords through the multiaccess channel is
fundamentally a problem of compressed sensing. In the case where each message
consists of a small number of bits, an iterative algorithm based on belief
propagation is developed for efficient decoding. Second, to satisfy the
half-duplex constraint, each codeword consists of randomly distributed on-slots
and off-slots. A node transmits during its on-slots, and listens to its
neighbors only through its own off-slots. Over one frame interval, each node
broadcasts a message to neighbors and simultaneously decodes neighbors'
messages based on the superposed signals received through its own off-slots.
Thus the solution fully exploits the multiaccess nature of the wireless medium
and addresses the half-duplex constraint at the fundamental level. In a network
consisting of Poisson distributed nodes, numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme often achieves several times the rate of slotted ALOHA and CSMA
with the same packet error rate.

Poisson equation $\mu(a,k)$ and the ratio of the Newtonian potentials
$\eta(a,k)$. However, by comparing the aforementioned model against other
viable scalaron theories we highlight that the common form of $\mu(a,k)$ and
$\eta(a,k)$ in the literature does not accurately represent $f(R)$ behaviour.
We subsequently construct an improved description for the scalaron mass (and
therefore $\mu(a,k)$ and $\eta(a,k)$) which captures their essential features
and has benefits derived from a more physical origin. We study the scalaron's
observational signatures and show the modification to the background Friedmann
equation and CMB power spectrum to be small. We also investigate its effects in
the linear and non linear matter power spectrum--where the signatures are
evident--thus giving particular importance to weak lensing as a probe of these
models. Using this new form, we demonstrate how the next generation Euclid
survey will constrain these theories and its complementarity to current solar
system tests. In the most optimistic case Euclid, together with a Planck prior,
can constrain a fiducial scalaron mass $M_{0} = 9.4 \times 10^{-30}{\rm eV}$ at
the $\sim 20 %$ level. However, the decay rate of the scalaron mass, with

estimated based on $Y$ by a mismatched estimator that would have minimized the
expected loss had $X \sim Q$, the integral over all values of $\gamma$ of the
excess mean loss is equal to the relative entropy between $P$ and $Q$.

non-negative stochastic process and the conditional law of $Y^T=\{Y_t, 0\le

to the expected value of the minimum mean loss in \emph{non-causal} filtering
(smoothing) achieved with a channel whose parameter $\gamma$ is uniformly
distributed between 0 and $\gamma_0$. Bridging the two quantities is the mutual

losses in causal and non-causal filtering holds also in the case where the
filters employed are mismatched, i.e., optimized assuming a law on $X^T$ which
is not the true one. Bridging the two quantities in this case is the sum of the

loss due to mismatch in this setting.

asymptotically unbiased. Two qualifying measures of support are defined. The
first is minimax optimal with respect to the population and is equivalent to a

likelihood weights for compatibility with more general models.

atomic collective angular momentum operators, entanglement is a peculiar
phenomena arising due to superpositions in the multiparticle Hilbert space.
Here, we outline different quantitative measures of spin squeezing and discuss
the intrinsic relation of spin squeezing with quantum entanglement in
multiqubit systems.

compositional model of meaning for distributional semantics, in which each word
in a sentence has a meaning vector and the distributional meaning of the
sentence is a function of the tensor products of the word vectors. Abstractly
speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical
structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces.
In this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear
meaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of
sentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby
meaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure,
live in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor
product of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each
augmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of
sentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors.

that area has gained momentum. Given some of the strategic advantages for a
bistatic configuration, and tech- nological advances in the past few years,
large-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near
future. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least
par- tially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be
manageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities
of an automatic target recognition (ATR) facil- ity in a bistatic radar system
is presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on
simulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for
the introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that,
contrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be
substantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR
performed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the
ATR per- formance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic
angle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have
distinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results,
suggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR per-
formance with changing bistatic angle. Finally, a new fast and robust ATR
algorithm (developed in the present work) has been presented.

perturbations from an initially anisotropic universe for the high momentum
modes in the context of WKB approximations, as the continuation of the work
[29]. We consider the Einstein gravity coupled to a light scalar field. We then
assume that the scalar field has the zero velocity initially and then slowly
rolls down on the potential toward the origin. In the slow-roll approximations,
the Kasner-de Sitter universe with a planar symmetry is a good approximation as
the background evolution. Quantization of the perturbations in the adiabatic
vacuum, which we call the anisotropic vacuum, is carried out. For non-planar
high momentum modes whose comoving momentum component orthogonal to the plane
is bigger than the Hubble parameter at the inflationary phase, the WKB
approximation is valid for the whole stage of the isotropization. On the other
hand, the planar modes whose comoving momentum component orthogonal to the
plane is comparable to the Hubble parameter, is amplified during the process of
the anisotropic expansion. In the final gravitational wave spectra, we find
that there is an asymmetry between the two polarizations of the gravitational

find computable bounds for them for Markov processes representing unreliable

that, for unreliable Jackson networks, the spectral gap is strictly positive if
and only if the spectral gaps for the corresponding coordinate birth and death
processes are positive. Next, utilizing some results on birth and death
processes, we find bounds on the spectral gap for network processes in terms of
the hazard and equilibrium functions of the one dimensional marginal
distributions of the stationary distribution of the network. These
distributions must be in this case strongly light-tailed, in the sense that
their discrete hazard functions have to be separated from zero. We relate these
hazard functions with the corresponding networks' service rate functions using
the equilibrium rates of the stationary one dimensional marginal distributions.
We compare the obtained bounds on the spectral gap with some other known
bounds.

for LAttice Space-Time (LAST) coded MIMO channel is analyzed. We determine the
rates achievable by lattice coding and sequential decoding applied to such a
channel. The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) under lattice sequential
decoding is derived as a function of its parameter---the bias term, which is
critical for controlling the amount of computations required at the decoding
stage. Achieving low decoding complexity requires increasing the value of the
bias term. However, this is done at the expense of losing the optimal tradeoff
of the channel. In this work, we derive the tail distribution of the decoder's
computational complexity in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Our analysis
reveals that the tail distribution of such a low complexity decoder is
dominated by the outage probability of the channel for the underlying coding
scheme. Also, the tail exponent of the complexity distribution is shown to be
equivalent to the DMT achieved by lattice coding and lattice sequential
decoding schemes. We derive the asymptotic average complexity of the sequential
decoder as a function of the system parameters. In particular, we show that
there exists a cut-off multiplexing gain for which the average computational
complexity of the decoder remains bounded.

an iterated prisoner's dilemma against each other strategy (round-robin) and as
a variant also against itself. The participants of a tournament are all
strategies that are deterministic and have the same size of memory with regard
to their own and their opponent's past actions: up to three most recent actions
of their opponent and up to two most recent actions of their own. A focus is
set on the investigation of the influence of the number of iterations, details
of the payoff matrix, and the influence of memory size. The main result is that
for the tournament as carried out here, different strategies emerge as winners
for different payoff matrices, even for different payoff matrices being similar
judged on if they fulfill relations T + S = P + R or 2R > T + S. As a
consequence of this result it is suggested that whenever the iterated
prisoner's dilemma is used to model a real system that does not explicitly fix
the payoff matrix, one should check if conclusions remain valid, when a
different payoff matrix is used.

of finite-temperature spin dynamics in a generic diluted magnet provide an
understanding in terms of two distinct energy scales associated with weakly

their efficient and scalable methods for data dissemination to numerous users.
But many of these networks have no provisions to provide users with long term
access to files after the initial interest has diminished, nor are they able to
guarantee protection for users from malicious clients that wish to implicate
them in incriminating activities. As such, users may turn to supplementary
measures for storing and transferring data in P2P systems. We present a new
file sharing paradigm, called a Graffiti Network, which allows peers to harness
the potentially unlimited storage of the Internet as a third-party
intermediary. Our key contributions in this paper are (1) an overview of a
distributed system based on this new threat model and (2) a measurement of its
viability through a one-year deployment study using a popular web-publishing
platform. The results of this experiment motivate a discussion about the
challenges of mitigating this type of file sharing in a hostile network
environment and how web site operators can protect their resources.

a Hermitian one. Based on the analysis of Bethe Ansatz solutions for a class of
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and the scattering problems for the corresponding
Hermitian Hamiltonians. It is shown that a scattering state of an arbitrary
Hermitian lattice embedded in a chain as the scattering center shares the same
wave function with the corresponding non-Hermitian tight binding lattice, which
consists of the Hermitian lattice with two additional on-site complex
potentials, no matter the non-Hermitian is broken PT symmetry or even non-PT.
An exactly solvable model is presented to demonstrate the main points of this
article.
