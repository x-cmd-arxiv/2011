considering two harmonic oscillators moving with constant relative velocity.
Recently we calculated the energy dissipation for such a case, [EPL {\bf 91},
60003 (2010); Europ. Phys. J. D {\bf 61}, 335 (2011)]. A recent study of Barton
[New J. Phys. {\bf 12}, 113044 (2010)] seemingly leads to a different result
for the dissipation. If such a discrepancy really were true, it would imply a
delicate difficulty for the basic theory of Casimir friction. In the present
note we show that the expressions for the dissipation are in fact physically
equivalent, at T=0.

large quantum numbers $n$. We illustrate the procedure by analyzing the
classical limit for the quantum harmonic oscillator, although the method is
quite general. We find, in an analytical fashion, the classical distribution
arising from the quantum one as the zeroth order term in an expansion in powers
of Planck's constant. We interpret the correction terms as residual quantum

computations in radiotherapy. Their execution time is however still an obstacle
to the routine use of Monte Carlo packages in a clinical setting. To address
this problem, a completely new, and designed from the ground up for the GPU,
Monte Carlo dose calculation package for voxelized geometries is proposed:
GPUMCD. Method : GPUMCD implements a coupled photon-electron Monte Carlo
simulation for energies in the range 0.01 MeV to 20 MeV. An analogue simulation
of photon interactions is used and a Class II condensed history method has been
implemented for the simulation of electrons. A new GPU random number generator,
some divergence reduction methods as well as other optimization strategies are
also described. GPUMCD was run on a NVIDIA GTX480 while single threaded
implementations of EGSnrc and DPM were run on an Intel Core i7 860. Results :
Dosimetric results obtained with GPUMCD were compared to EGSnrc. In all but one
test case, 98% or more of all significant voxels passed a gamma criteria of
2%-2mm. In terms of execution speed and efficiency, GPUMCD is more than 900
times faster than EGSnrc and more than 200 times faster than DPM, a Monte Carlo
package aiming fast executions. Absolute execution times of less than 0.3 s are
found for the simulation of 1M electrons and 4M photons in water for
monoenergetic beams of 15 MeV, including GPU-CPU memory transfers. Conclusion :
GPUMCD, a new GPU-oriented Monte Carlo dose calculation platform, has been
compared to EGSnrc and DPM in terms of dosimetric results and execution speed.
Its accuracy and speed make it an interesting solution for full Monte Carlo
dose calculation in radiation oncology.

presence of warm, shock heated dust, with no lines present in the spectrum. We
use model fits to {\it Spitzer} IRS data to estimate the density of the

interpret bright spots as places where the forward shock is running into
material that is several times denser than elsewhere. The densities we infer
for these objects depend on the grain omposition assumed, and we explore the
effects of differing grain porosity on the model fits. We also analyze archival
{\it XMM-Newton} RGS spectroscopic data, where both SNRs show strong lines of
both Fe and Si, coming from ejecta, as well as strong O lines, which may come
from ejecta or shocked ambient medium. We use model fits to IRS spectra to
predict X-ray O line strengths for various grain models and values of the shock
compression ratio. For 0509-67.5, we find that compact (solid) grain models
require nearly all O lines in X-ray spectra to originate in reverse-shocked
ejecta. Porous dust grains would lower the strength of ejecta lines relative to
those arising in the shocked ambient medium. In 0519-69.0, we find significant
evidence for a higher than standard compression ratio of 12, implying efficient
cosmic-ray acceleration by the blast wave. A compact grain model is favored
over porous grain models. We find that the dust-to-gas mass ratio of the
ambient medium is significantly lower than what is expected in the ISM.

it. While the social cost is the maximal load over all machines (makespan), the
cost (disutility) of each player is the completion time of its own job. In the
game, players may follow selfish strategies to optimize their cost and
therefore their behaviors do not necessarily lead the game to an equilibrium.
Even in the case there is an equilibrium, its makespan might be much larger
than the social optimum, and this inefficiency is measured by the price of
anarchy -- the worst ratio between the makespan of an equilibrium and the
optimum. Coordination mechanisms aim to reduce the price of anarchy by
designing scheduling policies that specify how jobs assigned to a same machine
are to be scheduled. Typically these policies define the schedule according to
the processing times as announced by the jobs. One could wonder if there are
policies that do not require this knowledge, and still provide a good price of
anarchy. This would make the processing times be private information and avoid
the problem of truthfulness. In this paper we study these so-called
non-clairvoyant policies. In particular, we study the RANDOM policy that
schedules the jobs in a random order without preemption, and the EQUI policy
that schedules the jobs in parallel using time-multiplexing, assigning each job

number of Fermi crossings odd. In the surface band calculation, however, this
crossing is explained by another Kramers' pair where the two splitting bands
are very close to each other. The classification of this family of materials as
topological insulators remains an open question.

central object in V4332 Sgr is now hidden in a dusty disc and that the
photospheric spectrum of this object observed in the optical results from
scattering the central star radiation on dust grains in the disc. One expects
significant polarization of the spectrum in this case. We investigate this
prediction. We present and analyse polarimetric observations of V4332 Sgr in
the V and R photometric bands done with the NOT telescope. The optical light of
V4332 Sgr is linearly polarized with a degree of ~26% in the V band and ~11% in

the topology of the ground-state phase diagram and identify the nature of the
phase transitions. In the strong coupling limit, a long-range N\'eel order of
entangled spin and orbital angular momentum appears in the ground state. We
find that, depending on the relative scales of the spin and orbital gaps, the
linear chain follows two distinct routes to reach the N\'eel state. First, when
the orbital exchange is the dominating energy scale, a two-stage ordering takes
place in which the magnetic transition is followed by melting of the orbital
Ising order; both transitions belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality
class. In the opposite limit, the low-energy orbital modes undergo a continuous
reordering transition which represents a line of Gaussian critical points. On
this line the orbital degrees of freedom form a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. We
argue that the emergence of the Gaussian criticality results from merging of
the two Ising transitions in the strong hybridization region where the
characteristic spin and orbital energy scales become comparable. Finally, we
show that, due to the spin-orbit coupling, an external magnetic field acting on
the spins can induce an orbital Ising transition.

remains one of the unresolved mysteries of the physical world. According to
recent theories, this conflict results in gravity-induced quantum state
reduction of ""Schr\""odinger cats"", quantum superpositions of macroscopic
observables. In recent years, great progress has been made in cooling
micromechanical resonators towards their quantum mechanical ground state. This
work is an important step towards the creation of Schr\""odinger cats in the
laboratory, and the study of their destruction by decoherence. A direct test of
the gravity-induced state reduction scenario may therefore be within reach.
However, a recent analysis shows that for all systems reported to date, quantum
superpositions are destroyed by environmental decoherence long before
gravitational state reduction takes effect. Here we report optical trapping of
glass microspheres in vacuum with high oscillation frequencies, and cooling of
the center-of-mass motion from room temperature to a minimum temperature of 1.5
mK. This new system eliminates the physical contact inherent to clamped
cantilevers, and can allow ground-state cooling from room temperature. After
cooling, the optical trap can be switched off, allowing a microsphere to
undergo free-fall in vacuum. During free-fall, light scattering and other
sources of environmental decoherence are absent, so this system is ideal for
studying gravitational state reduction. A cooled optically trapped object in
vacuum can also be used to search for non-Newtonian gravity forces at small
scales, measure the impact of a single air molecule, and even produce
Schr\""odinger cats of living organisms.

accompanying the development of the Herschel Mission (Pilbratt et al. 2010),
supporting all of its phases. In particular the reduction of data from the
scientific instruments for instrument checkout, calibration, and astronomical
analysis is one of its major applications. The data reduction software is split
up in modules, called ""tasks"". Agreed-upon sequences of tasks form pipelines
that deliver well defined standard products for storage in a web-accessible
Herschel Science Archive (HSA) (Leon et al. 2009). However, as astronomers and
instrument scientists continue to characterize instrumental effects,
astronomers already need to publish scientific results and may not have the
time to acquire a sufficiently deep understanding of the system to apply
necessary fixes. There is a need for intermediate level analysis tools that
offer more flexibility than rigid pipelines. The task framework within the HCSS
and the highly versatile Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE),
together with the rich set of libraries provide the necessary tools to develop
GUI-based interactive analysis packages for the Herschel instruments. The SPIRE
Photometer Interactive Analysis (SPIA) package, that was demonstrated in this
session, proves the validity of the concept for the SPIRE instrument (Griffin

making all relevant processing parameters available in GUIs, and providing a
more controlled and user-friendly access to the complexities of the system.

luminosity indicators, it has not been thoroughly examined for possible sources
of scatter. In the literature, the reported error bars for Epeak are the simple
Poisson statistical errors. Additional uncertainties arise due to the choices
made by analysts in determining Epeak (e.g., the start and stop times of
integration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, different
energy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit the
spectra. We examine the size of these individual sources of scatter by
comparing many independent pairs of published Epeak values for the same bursts.
Indeed, the observed scatter in multiple reports of the same burst (often with
the same data) is greatly larger than the published statistical error bars. We
measure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is
28%, i.e., 0.12 in Log10(Epeak), with the resultant errors always being
present. The errors associated with the detector response are negligibly small.
The variations caused by commonly-used alternative definitions of Epeak (such
as present in all papers and in all compiled burst lists) is typically 23%-46%,
although this varies substantially with the application. The implications of
this are: (1) Even the very best measured Epeak values will have systematic
uncertainties of 28%. (2) Thus, GRBs have a limitation in accuracy for a single
event, with this being reducible by averaging many bursts. (3) The typical
one-sigma total uncertainty for collections of bursts is 55%. (4) We also find
that the width of the distribution for Epeak in the burst frame must be near
zero, implying that some mechanism must exist to thermostat GRBs. (5) Our
community can only improve on this situation by using collections of bursts
which all have identical definitions for the Epeak calculation.

known galaxy cluster at z > 1, SPT-CL J2106-5844. In addition to producing a
strong Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous X-ray source
and its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, all
indicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. VLT and Magellan
spectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =
1.132^+0.002_-0.003. Chandra observations obtained through a combined HRC-ACIS
GTO program reveal an X-ray spectrum with an Fe K line redshifted by z = 1.18
+/- 0.03. These redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensive
optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. SPT-CL J2106-5844 displays
extreme X-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature of
kT = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 keV and a luminosity (within r_500) of L_X (0.5 - 2.0 keV)
= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. The combined mass estimate from measurements of
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and X-ray data is M_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15
M_sun. The discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at high
redshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,
and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matter
density field. We discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption of
LambdaCDM cosmology with only Gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chance
of finding a galaxy cluster similar to SPT-CL J2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 SPT
survey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entire
sky.

is found between a microscopic one dimensional cell-based stochastic model of
reversing non-overlapping bacteria and a macroscopic non-linear diffusion
equation describing dynamics of the cellular density. Boltzmann-Matano analysis
is used to determine the nonlinear diffusion equation corresponding to the
specific reversal frequency. Macroscopically (ensemble-vise) averaged
stochastic dynamics is shown to be in a very good agreement with the numerical
solutions of the nonlinear diffusion equation. Critical density $p_0$ is
obtained such that nonlinear diffusion is dominated by the collisions between
cells for the densities $p>p_0$. An analytical approximation of the pairwise
collision time and semi-analytical fit for the total jam time per reversal
period are also obtained. It is shown that cell populations with high reversal
frequencies are able to spread out effectively at high densities. If the cells
rarely reverse then they are able to spread out at lower densities but are less
efficient at spreading out at at higher densities.

formation using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. This paper presents a
catalog of the 26 most significant SZ cluster detections in the full survey
region. The catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identified
and 12 that are new discoveries. These clusters were identified in fields
observed to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final SPT survey
depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uK-arcmin.
Clusters were selected on the basis of their SZ signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in
SPT maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly with
cluster mass. The S/N thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable mass
selection across survey fields of both depths. Cluster redshifts were obtained
with optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-
and space-based facilities. The redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132
with a median of z_med = 0.40. The measured SZ S/N and redshifts lead to
unbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 M_sun/h_70 \leq
M_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 M_sun/h_70. Based on the SZ mass
estimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significant
tension with the LambdaCDM cosmological model. We also test for evidence of
non-Gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show no
preference for non-Gaussian perturbations.

predominantly in gravitationally bound clouds cooled by carbon monoxide (CO)

destabilizes clouds and initiates collapse. We use this model to compute how

predicted and observed multi-variable correlation between Mbh and bulge binding
energy. Although the tightness of the Mbh-Ngc correlation suggests an unlikely
causal link between supermassive black holes and globular clusters, such a
correspondence can exhibit small scatter even if the physical relationship is
indirect. We show that the relatively small scatter of the Mbh-Ngc relation
owes to the mutual residual correlation of Mbh and Ngc with stellar mass when
the velocity dispersion is held fixed. Thus, present observations lend evidence
for feedback-regulated models in which the bulge binding energy is most
important; they do not necessarily imply any `special' connection between
globular clusters and Mbh. This raises the question of why Ngc traces the
formation of ellipticals and bulges sufficiently well to be correlated with
binding energy.

Therefore it is difficult to interpret this feature in terms of the usual
coupling to a sharp dispersionless mode. In this paper we examine
electron-phonon coupling to the in-plane acoustic phonon branch arising from
the modulation of the screened Coulomb potential. We demonstrate that such a
coupling has a strong forward scattering peak, and as a consequence, a kink
occurs in the dispersion at an energy scale shifted by the local gap
$\delta(k)$. In addition, considerations for the reduction of screening with
underdoping naturally explains the observed doping dependence of the low-energy
kink. These results point to a strong coupling to the acoustic branch which is
peaked in the forward scattering direction and has important implications for
transport and pairing in the high-T$_c$ cuprates.

luminous,one of the most distant, and as well one of the most extended globular
clusters of the Milky Way. We propose that NGC2419 is the remnant of a merged
star cluster complex, which was possibly formed during an interaction between a
gas-rich galaxy and the Milky Way. To test this hypothesis, we performed
numerical simulations of 27 different models of star cluster complexes (CCs)
moving on a highly eccentric orbit in the Galactic halo. We vary the CC mass,
the CC size, and the initial distribution of star clusters in the CC to analyze
the influence of these parameters on the resulting objects. In all cases, the
vast majority of star clusters merged into a stable object. The derived
parameters mass, absolute V-band magnitude, effective radius, velocity
dispersion and the surface brightness profile are, for a number of models, in
good agreement with those observed for NGC2419. Despite the large range of CC
sizes, the effective radii of the merger objects are constrained to a
relatively small interval. A turnover in the r_eff vs. M_encl space leads to
degenerate states, i.e. relatively compact CCs can produce an object with the
same structural parameters as a more massive and larger CC. In consequence, a
range of initial conditions can form a merger object comparable to NGC2419
preventing us to pinpoint the exact parameters of the original CC, which formed
NGC2419. We conclude that NGC2419 can be well explained by the merged cluster
complex scenario. Some of the recently discovered stellar streams in the
Galactic halo might be related to the parent galaxy, which produced the cluster
complex in our scenario. Measurements of the proper motion of NGC2419 are
necessary to prove an association with one of the stellar streams.

masses. This nearby dwarf galaxy, simultaneoulsy hosting a massive black hole
and an extreme burst of star formation, is analogous in many ways to galaxies
in the infant Universe during the early stages of black-hole growth and galaxy
mass assembly. Our results confirm that nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies can
indeed form massive black holes, and that by implication so can their
primordial counterparts. Moreover, the lack of a substantial spheroidal

we consider two different models: independent and identically distributed

additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). These two models are considered to
incorporate effects of the channel noise along with the synchronization errors.
For the insertion channel case we consider the Gallager's model in which the
transmitted bits are replaced with two random bits and uniform over the four
possibilities independently of any other insertion events. The general approach
taken is similar in all cases, however the specific computations differ.
Furthermore, the approach yields a useful lower bound on the capacity for a
wide range of deletion probabilities for the deletion channels, while it
provides a beneficial bound only for small insertion probabilities (less than
0.25) for the insertion model adopted. We emphasize the importance of these
results by noting that 1) our results are the first analytical bounds on the
capacity of deletion-AWGN channels, 2) the results developed are the best
available analytical lower bounds on the deletion-substitution case, 3) for the

suggests that the supermassive black hole in IRAS\,18325-5926 may significantly
affect the large-scale environment of the host galaxy, unless the solid angle
subtended by the outflow or the gas filling factor is small. A second warm

the iron K edge, although insufficient counts in the data beyond $7.0$~keV make
it difficult to assess the nature of the second absorber. Most plausible is a
high ionization ($\log\xi\sim 2.3$ to $2.6$), high column density ($N_{\rm

generalization of the staggered flux phase on square lattice. Although the
state is generated from a time reversal symmetry broken mean field ansatz, it
actually represents a fully symmetric spin liquid state with a positive
definite wave function in the sense of Marshall sign rule for unfrustrated
antiferromagnets. The evolution of the state with the parameter $\Delta/\chi$
follows exactly the same manner as that of the staggered flux phase on square
lattice. The critical pairing strength corresponding to the $\pi$-flux phase is
found to be $\Delta/\chi=\sqrt{2}$. As a result of the geometric frustration
between neighboring plaquette on honeycomb lattice, a direct generalization of
the U(1) staggered flux pattern on square lattice to honeycomb lattice is
impossible. Replacing it is the chiral d-wave state with $Z_{2}$ gauge
structure. However, this $Z_{2}$ gauge structure is found to be ineffective
after Gutzwiller projection and the system does not support topological
degeneracy. The chiral d-wave RVB state is also found to be a rather good
variational state for the Heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice. The spin
correlation of the chiral d-wave state is found to be greatly enhanced as

propensities for homophily, mutuality, and friend-of-a-friend triad closure,
through choice of model terms (sufficient statistics). However, those ERGMs
modeling the more complex features have, to date, been limited to binary data:
presence or absence of ties. Thus, analysis of valued networks, such as those
where counts, measurements, or ranks are observed, has necessitated
dichotomizing them, losing information and introducing biases.
  In this work, we generalize ERGMs to valued networks. Focusing on modeling
counts, we formulate an ERGM for networks whose ties are counts and discuss
issues that arise when moving beyond the binary case. We introduce model terms
that generalize and model common social network features for such data and
apply these methods to a network dataset whose values are counts of
interactions.

of a multidimensional L\'{e}vy-driven stochastic differential equation and $f$
is a real-valued function on the path space. The algorithm relies on
approximations obtained by simulating large jumps of the L\'{e}vy process
individually and applying a Gaussian approximation for the small jump part.
Upper bounds are provided for the worst case error over the class of all
measurable real functions $f$ that are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
supremum norm. These upper bounds are easily tractable once one knows the
behavior of the L\'{e}vy measure around zero. In particular, one can derive
upper bounds from the Blumenthal--Getoor index of the L\'{e}vy process. In the
case where the Blumenthal--Getoor index is larger than one, this approach is
superior to algorithms that do not apply a Gaussian approximation. If the
L\'{e}vy process does not incorporate a Wiener process or if the
Blumenthal--Getoor index $\beta$ is larger than $\frac{4}{3}$, then the upper
bound is of order $\tau^{-({4-\beta})/({6\beta})}$ when the runtime $\tau$
tends to infinity. Whereas in the case, where $\beta$ is in $[1,\frac{4}{3}]$
and the L\'{e}vy process has a Gaussian component, we obtain bounds of order
$\tau^{-\beta/(6\beta-4)}$. In particular, the error is at most of order

Model), which is the MSM extended by three right-handed neutrinos. Especially,
we study elements of the mixing matrix $\Theta_{\alpha I}$ between three
left-handed neutrinos $\nu_\alpha$ ($\alpha = e,\mu,\tau$) and two sterile
neutrinos $N_I$ ($I=2,3$) which are responsible to the seesaw mechanism
generating the suppressed masses of active neutrinos as well as the generation
of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). It is shown that $\Theta_{eI}$
can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude compared with $\Theta_{\mu I}$
and $\Theta_{\tau I}$, when the Chooz angle $\theta_{13}$ is large in the
normal hierarchy of active neutrino masses. We then discuss the neutrinoless
double beta decay in this framework by taking into account the contributions
not only from active neutrinos but also from all the three sterile neutrinos.
It is shown that $N_2$ and $N_3$ give substantial, destructive contributions
when their masses are smaller than a few 100 MeV, and as a results $\Theta_{e
I}$ receive no stringent constraint from the current bounds on such decay.
Finally, we discuss the impacts of the obtained results on the direct searches
of $N_{2,3}$ in meson decays for the case when $N_{2,3}$ are lighter than pion
mass. We show that there exists the allowed region for $N_{2,3}$ with such
small masses in the normal hierarchy case even if the current bound on the
lifetimes of $N_{2,3}$ from the big bang nucleosynthesis is imposed. It is also
pointed out that the direct search by using $\pi^+ \to e^+ + N_{2,3}$ and $K^+
\to e^+ + N_{2,3}$ might miss such $N_{2,3}$ since the branching ratios can be
extremely small due to the cancellation in $\Theta_{eI}$, but the search by
$K^+ \to \mu^+ + N_{2,3}$ can cover the whole allowed region by improving the

from coalescing binary systems. We introduce a statistical framework based on
Bayesian model selection in which the Bayes factor between two competing
hypotheses measures which theory is favored by the data. Probability density
functions of the model parameters are then used to quantify the inference on
individual parameters. We also develop a method to combine the information
coming from multiple independent observations of gravitational waves, and show
how much stronger inference could be. As an introduction and illustration of
this framework - and a practical numerical implementation through the Monte
Carlo integration technique of nested sampling - we apply it to gravitational
waves from the inspiral phase of coalescing binary systems as predicted by
General Relativity and a very simple alternative theory in which the graviton
has a non-zero mass. This method can trivially (and should) be extended to more
realistic and physically motivated theories.

significantly higher than the equilibrium coexistence pressures are required to
induce the graphite-to-diamond transition. Furthermore, the formation of the
metastable hexagonal polymorph of diamond instead of the more stable cubic
diamond is favored at lower temperatures. The concerted mechanism suggested in
previous theoretical studies cannot explain these phenomena. Using an ab initio
quality neural-network potential we performed a large-scale study of the
graphite-to-diamond transition assuming that it occurs via nucleation. The
nucleation mechanism accounts for the observed phenomenology and reveals its
microscopic origins. We demonstrated that the large lattice distortions that
accompany the formation of the diamond nuclei inhibit the phase transition at
low pressure and direct it towards the hexagonal diamond phase at higher

towards a better understanding of structural transformations in a wide range of
complex systems such as amorphous carbon and carbon nanomaterials.

77 Fermi photons, with energies between 100 MeV and 5 GeV. The majority of GPs
came from the interpulse (IP) phase window. We found no change in the GP
generation rate within 10-120 s windows at lags of up to +-40 min of observed

limit, within the IP emission window, is 12 times the average pulsed gamma-ray

increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we analyse larger

periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through
minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints.
This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points,
such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new
method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal
number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost which, under
mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares
favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost
can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new
method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods.
We also compare with the Binary Segmentation algorithm for identifying
changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to
substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the

cluster Abell 2465 are described. This object appears to be undergoing a major
merger. It is a double X-ray source and is detected in the radio at 1.4 GHz.
This paper investigates signatures of the interaction of the two components.
Redshifts were measured to determine velocity dispersions and virial radii of
each component. The technique of fuzzy clustering was used to assign membership
weights to the galaxies in each clump. Using redshifts of 93 cluster members
within 1.4 Mpc of the subcluster centres, the virial masses and anisotropy
parameters are derived. 37% of the spectroscopically observed galaxies show
emission lines and are predominantly star forming in the diagnostic diagram. No
strong AGN sources were found. The emission line galaxies tend to lie between
the two cluster centres with more near the SW clump. The luminosity functions
of the two subclusters differ. The NE component is similar to many rich
clusters, while the SW component has more faint galaxies. The NE clump's light
profile follows a single NFW profile with c = 10 while the SW is better fit
with an extended outer region and a compact inner core, consistent with
available X-ray data indicating that the SW clump has a cooling core. The
observed differences and properties of the two components of Abell 2465 are
interpreted to have been caused by a collision 2-4 Gyr ago, after which they
have moved apart and are now near their apocentres, although the start of a
merger remains a possibility. The number of emission line galaxies gives weight
to the idea that galaxy cluster collisions trigger star formation.

rays (CRs) up to the ""knee"" of the CR spectrum at 10^15 eV, accelerating
particles to relativistic energies in their blast waves by the process of
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Since cosmic ray nuclei do not radiate
efficiently, their presence must be inferred indirectly. Previous theoretical
calculations and X-ray observations show that CR acceleration modifies
significantly the structure of the SNR and greatly amplifies the interstellar
magnetic field. We present new, deep X-ray observations of the remnant of
Tycho's supernova (SN 1572, henceforth Tycho), which reveal a previously
unknown, strikingly ordered pattern of non-thermal high-emissivity stripes in
the projected interior of the remnant, with spacing that corresponds to the
gyroradii of 10^14 - 10^15 eV} protons. Spectroscopy of the stripes shows the
plasma to be highly turbulent on the (smaller) scale of the Larmor radii of TeV
energy electrons. Models of the shock amplification of magnetic fields produce
structure on the scale of the gyroradius of the highest energy CRs present, but
they do not predict the highly-ordered pattern we observe. We interpret the
stripes as evidence for acceleration of particles to near the knee of the CR
spectrum in regions of enhanced magnetic turbulence, while the observed highly
ordered pattern of these features provides a new challenge to models of DSA.

atoms or molecules is considered by use of a statistical mechanical method.
Commonly this interaction is obtained by standard quantum mechanical
perturbation theory to second order. However, the latter is restricted to
electrostatic interactions between charges and dipole moments. So with
radiating dipole-dipole interaction where retardation effects are important for
large separations of the particles, other methods are needed, and the resulting
induced interaction is the Casimir-Polder interaction usually obtained by field
theory. It can also be evaluated, however, by a statistical mechanical method
that utilizes the path integral representation. We here show explicitly by use
of the statistical mechanical method the equivalence of the Casimir-Polder and
van der Waals interactions to leading order for short separations where
retardation effects can be neglected. Physically this is well known, but in our
opinion the mathematics of this transition process is not so obvious. The
evaluations needed mean a transform of the statistical mechanical free energy
expression to a form that can be identified with second order perturbation
theory. In recent works [H{\o}ye 2010] the Casimir-Polder or Casimir energy has
been added as a correction to calculations of systems like the electron clouds
of molecules.
  The equivalence to van der Waals interactions to leading order indicates that
the added Casimir energy will improve the accuracy of calculated molecular
energies. We here also give numerical estimates of this energy including
analysis and estimates for the uniform electron gas.

In order to achieve these goals, we developed a new software package, PIMA, for
determining group delays from wide-band data with much lower detection limit.
With the use of PIMA we have detected 327 sources out of 487 targets observed

421--451], separating $p'$ not only into rapid $p_{(\mathrm{r})}'$ and slow
$p_{(\mathrm{s})}'$ parts [Chou P.Y.: {\em Quart. Appl. Math.} {\bf 3} (1945)
38--54], but further into volume ($p'_{(\mathrm{r};\mathfrak{V})}$ and
$p'_{(\mathrm{s};\mathfrak{V})}$) and surface (wall-echo; $p'_{(\mathrm{r};w)}$
and $p'_{(\mathrm{s};w)}$) terms. An algorithm, based on a Green's function
approach, is developed to compute the above splittings for various correlations
containing pressure fluctuations (redistribution, pressure diffusion,
velocity/pressure-gradient), in fully developed turbulent plane channel flow.
This exact analysis confirms previous results based on a method-of-images
approximation [Manceau R., Wang M., Laurence D.: {\em J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 438}
(2001) 307--338] showing that, at the wall, $p'_{(\mathfrak{V})}$ and
$p'_{(w)}$ are usually of the same sign and approximately equal. The above
results are then used to study the contribution of each mechanism on the
pressure correlations in low Reynolds-number plane channel flow, and to discuss
standard second-moment-closure modelling practices.

graphene. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to tune the uniform strain of
graphene simply by changing the chemical vapor deposition growth temperature of
graphene on copper. Due to the cooling of the graphene on copper system, we can
induce a uniform compressive strain on graphene. The strain is analyzed by
Raman spectroscopy, where a shift in the 2D peak is observed and compared to
our ab initio calculations of the graphene on copper system as a function of
strain.
