to be spin polarized, which is reasonable in view of the Stoner enhanced

optimal values for these parameters. Next we perform numerical simulations to
take into account the effect of detector motions, and find reasonable

formed by 4 units of triangle detectors, the proposed BBO sensitivity would be
sufficient in receiving gravitational waves from all the NS/NS binaries at
$z\le 5$ with SNRs higher than 25. We also discuss the minimum sensitivity of

serendipitously discovered by the Swift satellite through an associated X-ray
flash. Core collapse supernovae have been observed in association with long
gamma-ray bursts and X-ray flashes and a physical connection is widely assumed.
This connection could imply that some core collapse supernovae possess mildly
relativistic jets in which high-energy neutrinos are produced through
proton-proton collisions. The predicted neutrino spectra would be detectable by
Cherenkov neutrino detectors like IceCube. A search for a neutrino signal in
temporal and spatial correlation with the observed X-ray flash of SN 2008D was
conducted using data taken in 2007-2008 with 22 strings of the IceCube
detector. Events were selected based on a boosted decision tree classifier
trained with simulated signal and experimental background data. The classifier
was optimized to the position and a ""soft jet"" neutrino spectrum assumed for SN
2008D. Using three search windows placed around the X-ray peak, emission time
scales from 100 - 10000 s were probed. No events passing the cuts were observed
in agreement with the signal expectation of 0.13 events. Upper limits on the
muon neutrino flux from core collapse supernovae were derived for different
emission time scales and the principal model parameters were constrained.

fundamental importance to understand the global carbon cycle between the deep
Earth and near surface reservoirs. Degassing of CO2 at mid-ocean ridges may
give information on the source region but the very low solubility of CO2 in
tholeitic basalts has for consequence that near all Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts
glasses exsolve their CO2 rich vapor at shallow depth as they approach the
ocean floor. Hence their CO2 contents mostly represent the pressure at eruption
and not the source region. Recent petrological investigations have shown that
the presence of carbonates at depth in the upper mantle has a large effect on
the solidus of carbonated silicates by inducing incipient melting at much lower
temperature. So the role of carbon-rich melts at great depth is now becoming a
credible scenario to explain the extraction of CO2 from the source region to
the surface. During the last three decades many studies have been devoted to
measure the solubility of CO2 in silicate melts of various composition. But due
to experimental difficulties these studies were generally restricted to low and
moderate pressures (below ~20 kbar). By performing a series of molecular
dynamics simulation where a supercritical CO2 phase is in contact with a
silicate melt of various composition (from felsic to ultrabasic) at different
temperatures (1473-2273K) and pressures (20-150kbar), we have been able to
evaluate the solubility of CO2, the population of molecular and carbonate
species, their diffusivity through the melt and the local structure. We show
that this kind of molecular simulation is a useful theoretical guide to better
understand the behavior of CO2 in magmas at depth.

fluid in a uniform electric field. The effect is widely used to separate
macromolecules, to assemble colloidal structures, to transport particles in
nano- and micro-fluidic devices and displays. Typically, the fluid is isotropic
(for example, water) and the electrophoretic velocity is linearly proportional
to the electric field. In linear electrophoresis, only a direct current (DC)
field can drive the particles. An alternate current (AC) field is more
desirable because it allows one to overcome problems such as electrolysis and
absence of steady flows. Here we show that when the electrophoresis is
performed in a nematic fluid, the effect becomes strongly non-linear with a
velocity component that is quadratic in the applied voltage and has a direction
that generally differs from the direction of linear velocity. The new
phenomenon is caused by distortions of the LC orientation around the particle
that break the fore-aft (or left-right) symmetry. The effect allows one to
transport both charged and neutral particles, even when the particles
themselves are perfectly symmetric (spherical), thus enabling new approaches in
display technologies, colloidal assembly, separation, microfluidic and
micromotor applications.

Its disturbances are monitored and dealt by the diagnostics subsystem. This
subsystem consists of several modules, and one of these is the magnetic
diagnostics system, which includes a set of four tri-axial fluxgate
magnetometers, intended to measure with high precision the magnetic field at
the positions of the test masses. However, since the magnetometers are located
far from the positions of the test masses, the magnetic field at their
positions must be interpolated. It has been recently shown that because there
are not enough magnetic channels, classical interpolation methods fail to
derive reliable measurements at the positions of the test masses, while neural
network interpolation can provide the required measurements at the desired
accuracy. In this paper we expand these studies and we assess the reliability

""basic object"" (generalized Brieskorn module with one generator) which
corresponds to the minimal filtered (regular) differential equation satisfied
by a relative de Rham cohomology class, began in [B.09] where the first
structure theorems are proved. Then in [B.10] we introduced the notion of theme
which corresponds in the $[\lambda]-$primitive case to frescos having a unique
Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence. Themes correspond to asymptotic expansion of a
given vanishing period, so to the image of a fresco in the module of asymptotic
expansions. For a fixed relative de Rham cohomology class (for instance given
by a smooth differential form $d-$closed and $df-$closed) each choice of a
vanishing cycle in the spectral eigenspace of the monodromy for the eigenvalue
$exp(-2i\pi.\lambda)$ produces a $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, which is a
quotient of the fresco associated to the given relative de Rham class itself.
So the problem to determine which theme is a quotient of a given fresco is
important to deduce possible asymptotic expansions of the various vanishing
period integrals associated to a given relative de Rham class when we change
the choice of the vanishing cycle. In the appendix we prove a general existence
result which naturally associate a fresco to any relative de Rham cohomology
class of a proper holomorphic function of a complex manifold onto a disc.

construct, using this function, an (a,b)-modules structure on the cohomology
sheaves of the formal completion (in \ $f$) \ of the complex of sheaves \
$(Ker\, df^{\bullet},d^{\bullet})$. These (a,b)-modules represent a filtered
version of the Gauss-Manin connection of \ $f$. The most simple example of this

holomorphic parameter is a function on the set of isomorphism classes of

general, an holomorphic parameter is not invariant by a change of variable, but
we prove a theorem of stability of holomorphic families of frescos by a change
of variable and it implies that an holomorphic parameter gives again an
holomorphic parameter by a change of variable. We construct here two different
kinds of holomorphic parameters which are (quasi-)invariant by change of
variable. The first kind is associated to Jordan blocks of the monodromy with
size at least two. The second kind is associated to the semi-simple part of the
monodromy and look like some ""cross ratio"" of eigenvectors. They allow, in the
situation describe above, to associate to a given (vanishing) relative de Rham

  Fixed some typos",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Random 3CNF formulas constitute an important distribution for measuring the
average-case behavior of propositional proof systems. Lower bounds for random
3CNF refutations in many propositional proof systems are known. Most notably
are the exponential-size resolution refutation lower bounds for random 3CNF
formulas with $\Omega(n^{1.5-\epsilon}) $ clauses [Chvatal and Szemeredi
(1988), Ben-Sasson and Wigderson (2001)]. On the other hand, the only known
non-trivial upper bound on the size of random 3CNF refutations in a
non-abstract propositional proof system is for resolution with
$\Omega(n^{2}/\log n) $ clauses, shown by Beame et al. (2002). In this paper we
show that already standard propositional proof systems, within the hierarchy of
Frege proofs, admit short refutations for random 3CNF formulas, for
sufficiently large clause-to-variable ratio. Specifically, we demonstrate
polynomial-size propositional refutations whose lines are $TC^0$ formulas
(i.e., $TC^0$-Frege proofs) for random 3CNF formulas with $ n $ variables and $
\Omega(n^{1.4}) $ clauses.
  The idea is based on demonstrating efficient propositional correctness proofs
of the random 3CNF unsatisfiability witnesses given by Feige, Kim and Ofek
(2006). Since the soundness of these witnesses is verified using spectral
techniques, we develop an appropriate way to reason about eigenvectors in
propositional systems. To carry out the full argument we work inside weak
formal systems of arithmetic and use a general translation scheme to
propositional proofs.

locally adapt to the network availability in media streaming applications.
However, it may also increase delay and computational complexity if it is not
implemented efficiently. We address here the effective placement of nodes that
implement randomized network coding in overlay networks, so that the goodput is
kept high while the delay for decoding stays small in streaming applications.
We first estimate the decoding delay at each client, which depends on the
innovative rate in the network. This estimation permits to identify the nodes
that have to perform coding for a reduced decoding delay. We then propose two
iterative algorithms for selecting the nodes that should perform network
coding. The first algorithm relies on the knowledge of the full network

node. Simulation results show that large performance gains can be achieved with
the selection of only a few network coding nodes. Moreover, the second
algorithm performs very closely to the central estimation strategy, which
demonstrates that the network coding nodes can be selected efficiently in a

throughput, delay and video quality in realistic overlay networks when compared
to methods that employ traditional streaming strategies as well as random

  Quantum Field Theory"" [arXiv:1002.3253]","7 pages",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent letter by Carl M. Bender and S. P. Klevansky [arXiv:1002.3253] an
elementary field theory is proposed where the authors claimed that it can
account for the existence of family of particles without any employment of
group structures. In this work, we relied on the fact that the Dyson-Schwinger
equations used by the authors stem from a variational principle and tried to
reproduce their results by a mere variational algorithm. We were able to
reproduce exactly their results by the employment of two different variational
calculations of the vacuum energy in the proposed theory. We showed that the
two vacuum solutions obtained by the authors of the commented letter correspond
to two non-degenerate vacuum energies except for the $d=0$ space-time
dimensions where the vacuum states are degenerate. Since any variational
calculation of the vacuum energy should be higher than the true (exact) vacuum
energy, the most accurate result will correspond to the vacuum that lowers the
vacuum energy. We showed that the vacuum with unbroken $Z_{2}$ symmetry has
lower energy than the vacuum with broken $Z_{2}$ symmetry. Accordingly, the
theory will prefer to live with the vacuum of unbroken $Z_{2}$ symmetry in
which the proposed theory is Hermitian. Thus the proposed theory neither has a
preferred non-Hermitian representation nor it describes a family of particles
as claimed by the authors of the commented work.

in the early embedded phase can be destroyed before they either form solid
cores or vaporize dust grains, thus releasing the processed crystalline dust
into various radial distances from sub-AU to hundred-AU scales. Two possible
mechanisms for the destruction of fragments are the tidal disruption and
photoevaporation as fragments migrate radially inward and approach the central
star and also dispersal by tidal torques exerted by spiral arms. As a result,
most of the crystalline dust concentrates to the disk inner regions and spiral
arms, which are the likely sites of fragment destruction.

reverse engineer signaling pathways from gene sets inferred from molecular

ensemble of overlapping linear signal transduction events which we encode as
Information Flow Gene Sets (IFGS's). We infer pathways from gene sets
corresponding to these events subjected to a random permutation of genes within
each set. In Stage I, we use a source separation algorithm to derive unordered
and overlapping IFGS's from molecular profiling data, allowing cross talk among
IFGS's. In Stage II, we develop a Gibbs sampling like algorithm, Gene Set Gibbs
Sampler, to reconstruct signaling pathways from the latent IFGS's derived in
Stage I. The novelty of this framework lies in the seamless integration of the
two stages and the hypothesis of IFGS's as the basic building blocks for signal
pathways. In the proof-of-concept studies, our approach is shown to outperform
the existing Bayesian network approaches using both continuous and discrete
data generated from benchmark networks in the DREAM initiative. We perform a
comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the approach.
Finally, we implement the GSGS framework to reconstruct signaling pathways in
breast cancer cells.

such a model it is possible to have a blow up of the pressure occurring at

in this model that results in a singular behaviour of the pressure also admits

scaling laws that relate the low temperature neutron spectra of the primary
(""Kondo-esque"") spin fluctuation to the specific heat and susceptibility. While
the scaling appears to work very well for the rare earth intermediate valence
compounds, for a number of key uranium compounds the scaling laws fail badly.
There are two main reasons for this failure. First, the presence of
antiferromagnetic (AF) fluctuations, which contribute significantly to the
specific heat, alters the scaling ratios. Second, the scaling laws require
knowledge of the high temperature moment degeneracy, which is often
undetermined for itinerant 5$f$ electrons. By making plausible corrections for
both effects, better scaling ratios are obtained for some uranium compounds. We
point out that while both the uranium HF compounds and the rare earth
intermediate valence (IV) compounds have spin fluctuation characteristic
energies of order 5 - 25 meV, they differ in that the AF fluctuations that are
usually seen in the U compounds are never seen in the rare earth IV compounds.
This suggests that the 5f itineracy increases the f-f exchange relative to the
rare earth case.

Galactic O stars, based on new, high signal-to-noise ratio, R~2500 digital
observations from both hemispheres selected from the Galactic O-Star Catalog of
Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz et al. (2004) and Sota et al. (2008). The spectral
classification system is rediscussed and a new atlas is presented, which
supersedes previous versions. Extensive sequences of exceptional objects are
given, including types Ofc, ON/OC, Onfp, Of?p, Oe, and double-lined
spectroscopic binaries. The remaining normal spectra bring this first sample to
184 stars, which is close to complete to B=8 and north of delta = -20 and
includes all of the northern objects in Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz et al. (2004) that
are still classified as O stars. The systematic and random accuracies of these
classifications are substantially higher than previously attainable, because of
the quality, quantity, and homogeneity of the data and analysis procedures.
These results will enhance subsequent investigations in Galactic astronomy and
stellar astrophysics. In the future we will publish the rest of the survey,
beginning with a second paper that will include most of the southern stars in
Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz et al. (2004).

  role-playing-game strategy decision systems",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a Role-Playing Game, finding optimal trajectories is one of the most
important tasks. In fact, the strategy decision system becomes a key component
of a game engine. Determining the way in which decisions are taken (online,
batch or simulated) and the consumed resources in decision making (e.g.
execution time, memory) will influence, in mayor degree, the game performance.
When classical search algorithms such as A* can be used, they are the very
first option. Nevertheless, such methods rely on precise and complete models of
the search space, and there are many interesting scenarios where their
application is not possible. Then, model free methods for sequential decision
making under uncertainty are the best choice. In this paper, we propose a
heuristic planning strategy to incorporate the ability of heuristic-search in
path-finding into a Dyna agent. The proposed Dyna-H algorithm, as A* does,
selects branches more likely to produce outcomes than other branches. Besides,
it has the advantages of being a model-free online reinforcement learning
algorithm. The proposal was evaluated against the one-step Q-Learning and
Dyna-Q algorithms obtaining excellent experimental results: Dyna-H
significantly overcomes both methods in all experiments. We suggest also, a
functional analogy between the proposed sampling from worst trajectories
heuristic and the role of dreams (e.g. nightmares) in human behavior.

radiative decay of a heavy sterile neutrino ($\nu_h$) of the mass from 40 to 80

ordinary muon or kaon decay would result in the decay chain $\muhd$ or $\khd$,
respectively. We propose a new experiment for a sensitive search for these
processes in $\mu$ and $K$ decays at rest allowing to either definitively
confirm or exclude the existence of the $\nu_h$. To our knowledge, no

by spin generates, in the classical Dirac equation, the Hehl-Datta term which
is cubic in spinor fields. We show that under a charge-conjugation
transformation this term changes sign relative to the mass term. A classical
Dirac spinor and its charge conjugate therefore satisfy different field
equations. Fermions in the presence of torsion have higher energy levels than
antifermions, which leads to their decay asymmetry. Such a difference is
significant only at extremely high densities that existed in the very early
Universe. We propose that this difference caused a mechanism, according to
which heavy fermions existing in such a Universe and carrying the baryon number
decayed mostly to normal matter, whereas their antiparticles decayed mostly to
hidden antimatter which forms dark matter. The conserved total baryon number of
the Universe remained zero.

the total number of binary pairs (including components of high-order multiples)

members are multiple systems of two or more stars, while the other ~1/4--1/3
appear to have formed as single stars; the distribution of high-order
multiplicity suggests that fragmentation into a wide binary has no impact on
the subsequent probability that either component will fragment again. The
separation distribution for solar-type stars (0.7--2.5 Msun) is nearly log-flat
over separations of 3--5000 AU, but lower-mass stars (0.25--0.7 Msun) show a
paucity of binary companions with separations of >200 AU. Across this full mass
range, companion masses are well described with a linear-flat function; all
system mass ratios (q=M_B/M_A) are equally probable, apparently including
substellar companions. Our results are broadly consistent with the two expected

structure and cosmological parameters. Precision weak lensing measurements
require an understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities,
which can in turn inform models of galaxy formation. It is hypothesized that
elliptical galaxies align with the background tidal field and that this
alignment mechanism dominates the correlation between ellipticities on
cosmological scales (in the absence of lensing). We use recent large-scale
structure measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to test this picture
with several statistics: (1) the correlation between ellipticity and galaxy
overdensity, w_{g+}; (2) the intrinsic alignment auto-correlation functions;
(3) the correlation functions of curl-free, E, and divergence-free, B, modes
(the latter of which is zero in the linear tidal alignment theory); (4) the
alignment correlation function, w_g(r_p,theta), a recently developed statistic
that generalizes the galaxy correlation function to account for the angle
between the galaxy separation vector and the principle axis of ellipticity. We
show that recent measurements are largely consistent with the tidal alignment
model and discuss dependence on galaxy luminosity. In addition, we show that at
linear order the tidal alignment model predicts that the angular dependence of
w_g(r_p,theta) is simply w_{g+}*cos(2*theta) and that this dependence is
consistent with recent measurements. We also study how stochastic nonlinear
contributions to galaxy ellipticity impact these statistics. We find that a
significant fraction of the observed LRG ellipticity can be explained by
alignment with the tidal field on scales >~10 h^-1 Mpc. These considerations
are relevant to galaxy formation and evolution.

composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) becomes dominated by
heavy nuclei at high energies. However, until now there has been no
astrophysical motivation for considering a source highly enriched in heavy
elements. Here we demonstrate that the outflows from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)
may indeed be composed primarily of nuclei with masses A ~ 40-200, which are
synthesized as hot material expands away from the central engine. In
particular, if the jet is magnetically-dominated (rather than a
thermally-driven fireball) its low entropy enables heavy elements to form
efficiently. Adopting the millisecond proto-magnetar model for the GRB central
engine, we show that heavy nuclei are both synthesized in proto-magnetar winds
and can in principle be accelerated to energies >1e20 eV in the shocks or
regions of magnetic reconnection that are responsible for powering the GRB.
Similar results may apply to accretion-powered GRB models if the jet originates
from a magnetized disk wind. Depending on the precise distribution of nuclei
synthesized, we predict that the average primary mass may continue to increase
beyond Fe group elements at the highest energies, possibly reaching the A ~ 90
(Zirconium), A ~ 130 (Tellurium), or even A ~ 195 (Platinum) peaks. Future
measurements of the UHECR composition at energies >~ 1e20 eV can thus confirm
or constrain our model and, potentially, probe the nature of GRB outflows. The
longer attenuation length of ultra-heavy nuclei through the extragalactic
background light greatly expands the volume of accesible sources and alleviates
the energetic constraints on GRBs as the source of UHECRs.

are formed in clusters. Observational studies of field stars and star cluster
systems in nearby galaxies can lead to better constraints on the fraction of
stars forming in clusters. We aim to constrain the amount of star formation
happening in long-lived clusters for four galaxies through the homogeneous
study of field stars and star clusters. Using HST/ACS-WFPC2 images of the
galaxies NGC45, NGC1313, NGC5236 and NGC7793, we estimate star formation
histories by means of the synthetic CMD method. Masses and ages of star
clusters are estimated using simple stellar population model fitting. Comparing
observed and modeled luminosity functions we estimate cluster formation rates.
By randomly sampling the stellar IMF, we construct artificial star clusters and
quantify how stochastic effects influence cluster detection, integrated colors
and age estimates. Star formation rates appear to be constant over the past
10-100 Myr. The number of clusters identified per galaxy varies, with few
massive (>10^5Msun) and few old (>1Gyr) clusters. The galaxies NGC5236 and
NGC1313 show high star and cluster formation rates compare to NGC7793 and
NGC45. Stochastic sampling of the SIMF has a strong impact on estimation of
ages, colors and completeness for clusters with masses <10^4Msun, while for
high masses the effect is less pronounced. Stochasticity also makes size
measurements highly uncertain at young ages, making it difficult to distinguish
between clusters and stars based on sizes. The ratio of star formation
happening in clusters compared to the global star formation ($\Gamma$) appears
to vary for different galaxies. We find no obvious relation between $\Gamma$
and the star formation rate density within the range probed here. The $\Gamma$
values do, however, appear to correlate with the specific U-band luminosity
(T_L (U)).

at high redshifts in submillimeter-selected galaxies and quasars. In the latter

towards the end of cosmic reionization when the universe was less than one Gyr

extended these studies from the most extreme objects in the universe

detecting the molecular gas reservoirs of high-redshift galaxies that only have
moderate star formation rates (~<10 M_sun/yr, similar to the faint galaxies
seen in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field) will likely have to await the completion

abundance of X_CI/X_H2~8.4+/-3.5 x 10^-5 is of the same order as found in the

Pictoris, a standing question has been why the gas observed against the star in
absorption is not rapidly expelled by the strong radiation pressure from the
star. A solution to the puzzle has been suggested to be that the neutral
elements that experience the radiation force also are rapidly ionized, and so
are only able to accelerate to an average limiting velocity v_ion. Once
ionized, the elements are rapidly braked by C II, which is observed to be at
least 20x overabundant in the disk with respect to other species. A prediction
from this scenario is that different neutral elements should reach different
v_ion, depending on the ionization thresholds and strengths of driving line
transitions. In particular, neutral Fe and Na are predicted to reach the radial
velocities 0.5 and 3.3 km/s, respectively, before being ionized. In this paper
we study the absorption profiles of Fe and Na from the circumstellar gas disk
around beta Pic, as obtained by HARPS at the ESO 3.6m telescope. We find that
the Fe and Na velocity profiles are indeed shifted with respect to each other,
confirming the model. The absence of an extended blue wing in the profile of
Na, however, indicates that there must be some additional braking on the
neutrals. We explore the possibility that the ion gas (dominated by C II) can
brake the neutrals, and conclude that about 2-5x more C than previously
estimated is needed for the predicted line profile to be consistent with the
observed one.

Maki-Thompson and Aslamasov-Larkin contributions of superconducting
fluctuations to the conductivity but, contrary to the latter, they include
non-perturbative effects. The resulting analytical expressions must be
evaluated numerically. The calculations are impossible unless a number of
advanced numerical algorithms are used. A maximum entropy approach is specially
developed for analytical continuation of our results. The numerical results are
for nearest neighbor hoppings. In the pseudogap regime induced by
two-dimensional antiferromagnetic fluctuations, the effect of vertex
corrections is dramatic. Without vertex corrections the resistivity increases
as we enter the pseudogap regime. Adding vertex corrections leads to a drop in
resistivity, as observed in some high temperature superconductors. At high
temperature, the resistivity saturates at the Ioffe-Regel limit. At the quantum
critical point and beyond, the resistivity displays both linear and quadratic
temperature dependence and there is a correlation between the linear term and
the superconducting transition temperature. A hump is observed in the
mid-infrared range of the optical conductivity in the presence of
antiferromagnetic fluctuations.

time taken for a biased random walk to return to the root of a subcritical
Galton-Watson tree. We do so for trees in which these biases are randomly
chosen, independently for distinct edges, according to a law that satisfies a
logarithmic non-lattice condition. The mean return time of the walk is in
essence given by the total conductance of the tree. We determine the asymptotic
decay of this total conductance, finding it to have a pure power-law decay. In
the case of the conductance associated to a single vertex at maximal depth in
the tree, this asymptotic decay may be analysed by the classical defective
renewal theorem, due to the non-lattice edge-bias assumption.
  However, the derivation of the decay for total conductance requires computing
an additional constant multiple outside the power-law that allows for the
contribution of all vertices close to the base of the tree. This computation
entails a detailed study of a convenient decomposition of the tree, under
conditioning on the tree having high total conductance. As such, our principal
conclusion may be viewed as a development of renewal theory in the context of
random environments.
  For randomly biased random walk on a supercritical Galton-Watson tree with
positive extinction probability, our main results may be regarded as a
description of the slowdown mechanism caused by the presence of subcritical
trees adjacent to the backbone that may act as traps that detain the walker.
Indeed, this conclusion is exploited in \cite{GerardAlan} to obtain a stable
limiting law for walker displacement in such a tree.

prove a stable limiting law for walker distance at late time, proving that the

These magnetospheric interactions are expected to have scales and magnetic
field strengths comparable to those of large X-ray flares from single
pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars observed in the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP). To search for X-rays arising from processes associated with colliding
magnetospheres, we performed simultaneous X-ray and mm observations of DQ Tau
near periastron phase. We report here several results. 1) As anticipated, DQ
Tau was caught in a flare state in both mm and X-rays. A single long X-ray
flare spanned the entire 16.5 hour Chandra exposure. 2) The inferred
morphology, duration, and plasma temperature of the X-ray flare are typical of
those of large flares from COUP stars. 3) However, our study provides three
lines of evidence that this X-ray flare likely arises from colliding
magnetospheres: the chance of capturing a large COUP-like flare within the span
of our observation is small; the relative timing of the X-ray and mm flares
indicates the Neupert effect and is consistent with a common coronal structure;
the size of the emitting coronal structure (4-5Rstar) inferred from our
analysis (which is admittedly model-dependent and should be considered with
caution) is comparable to half the binary separation. 4) The peak flare X-ray
luminosity is in agreement with an estimate of the power dissipated by magnetic
reconnection within the framework of a simple model of interacting

regular three-dimensional lattice, and let $p_n(K)$ be the number which have
knot type $K$. The probability that a random polygon of length $n$ has knot
type $K$ is $p_n(K)/p_n$ and is known to decay exponentially with length.
Little is known rigorously about the asymptotics of $p_n(K)$, but there is
substantial numerical evidence that $p_n(K)$ grows as $p_n(K) \simeq \, C_K \,
\mu_\emptyset^n \, n^{\alpha-3+N_K}$, as $n \to \infty$, where $N_K$ is the
number of prime components of the knot type $K$. It is believed that the
entropic exponent, $\alpha$, is universal, while the exponential growth rate,
$\mu_\emptyset$, is independent of the knot type but varies with the lattice.
The amplitude, $C_K$, depends on both the lattice and the knot type.
  The above asymptotic form implies that the relative probability of a random
polygon of length $n$ having prime knot type $K$ over prime knot type $L$ is
$\frac{p_n(K)/p_n}{p_n(L)/p_n} = \frac{p_n(K)}{p_n(L)} \simeq [ \frac{C_K}{C_L}
]$. In the thermodynamic limit this probability ratio becomes an amplitude
ratio; it should be universal and depend only on the knot types $K$ and $L$. In
this letter we examine the universality of these probability ratios for
polygons in the simple cubic, face-centered cubic, and body-centered cubic
lattices. Our results support the hypothesis that these are universal
quantities. For example, we estimate that a long random polygon is
approximately 28 times more likely to be a trefoil than be a figure-eight,
independent of the underlying lattice, giving an estimate of the intrinsic
entropy associated with knot types in closed curves.

For spin up states the hybridized N-2p and Co/Ni-3d states form the valance

case of the spin down states the hybridized states cross the Fermi level and
hence show metallic nature. It is found that, Al0.75Co0.25N and Al0.75Ni0.25N

it is also found that the interaction with the N-2p state splits the 5-fold
degenerate Co/Ni-3d states into t2g and eg states. The t2g states are located
at higher energies than the eg states caused by the tetrahedral symmetry of

our attention on the evolution of the peak energy, $E_{0,p}$, and neglect the
effect of the curvature effect. It is found that the evolution of $E_{0,p}$
alone can produce the observed lags. When $E_{0,p}$ varies from hard to soft
only the positive lags can be observed. The negative lags would occur in the
case of $E_{0,p}$ varying from soft to hard. When the evolution of $E_{0,p}$
and the low-energy spectral index $\alpha_{0}$ varying from soft to hard then
to soft we can find the aforesaid two sorts of lags. We then examine the
combined case of the spectral evolution and the curvature effect of fireball
and find the observed spectral lags would increase. A sample including 15
single pulses whose spectral evolution follows hard to soft has been
investigated. All the lags of these pulses are positive, which is in good
agreement with our theoretical predictions. Our analysis shows that only the
intrinsic spectral evolution can produce the spectral lags and the observed
lags should be contributed by the intrinsic spectral evolution and the
curvature effect. But it is still unclear what cause the spectral evolution.

galaxy in the Virgo Cluster which is a clear example of strong, ongoing ICM-ISM
ram pressure stripping. The HI has been removed from well within the
undisturbed old stellar disk, to 50% - 65% of R_25. Multi-wavelength data (WIYN
BVR and H-alpha, VLA 21-cm HI and radio continuum, and GALEX NUV and FUV)
reveal several one-sided extraplanar features likely caused by ram pressure at
an intermediate disk-wind angle. At the leading edge of the interaction, the
H-alpha and dust extinction curve sharply out of the disk in a remarkable and
distinctive ""upturn"" feature that may be generally useful as a diagnostic
indicator of active ram pressure. On the trailing side, the ISM is stretched
out in a long tail which contains 10% of the galaxy's total HI emission, 6 - 9%
of its NUV-FUV emission, but only 2% of the H-alpha. The centroid of the HI
tail is downwind of the UV/H-alpha tail, suggesting that the ICM wind has
shifted most of the ISM downwind over the course of the past 10 - 300 Myr.
Along the major axis, the disk is highly asymmetric in the UV, but more
symmetric in H-alpha and HI, also implying recent changes in the distributions
of gas and star formation. The UV-optical colors indicate very different star
formation histories for the leading and trailing sides of the galaxy. On the
leading side, a strong gradient in the UV-optical colors of the gas-stripped
disk suggests that it has taken 200-400 Myr to strip the gas from a radius of
>8 to 5 kpc, but on the trailing side there is no age gradient. All our data
suggest a scenario in which NGC 4330 is falling into cluster center for first
time and has experienced a significant increase in ram pressure over the last
200-400 Myr.

integrated (MOPI) scheme for achieving physical-layer security in practice
without using any cryptographic ciphers. The MOPI scheme uses channel sounding
and physical-layer network coding (PNC) to prevent eavesdroppers from learning
the channel state information (CSI). Nevertheless, due to the use of multiple
antennas for PNC at transmitter and beamforming at receiver, it is not possible
to have spatial multiplexing nor use space-time codes in our previous MOPI
scheme. In this paper, we propose a variant of the MOPI scheme, called P-MOPI,
that works with a cryptographic cipher and utilizes precoding matrix index
(PMI) as an efficient key-exchange mechanism. With channel sounding, the PMI is
only known between the transmitter and the legal receiver. The shared key can
then be used, e.g., as the seed to generate pseudo random bit sequences for
securing subsequent transmissions using a stream cipher. By applying the same
techniques at independent subcarriers of the OFDM system, the P-MOPI scheme
easily allows two communicating parties to exchange over 100 secret bits. As a
result, not only secure communication but also the MIMO gain can be guaranteed
by using the P-MOPI scheme.

is crucial to the understanding of these systems and their formation. However,
the present allowed black hole mass range spans five order of magnitude (10Msun
< M < 10^5 Msun) with the upper limit obtained from dynamical friction
arguments. We show that the absence of a detectable optical counterpart for
some of these sources, can provide a much more stringent upper limit. The
argument is based only on the assumption that the outer regions of their
accretion disks is a standard one. Moreover, such optically dark X-ray sources
cannot be foreground stars or background active galactic nuclei, and hence must
be accreting systems residing within their host galaxies. As a demonstration we
search for candidates among the point-like X-ray sources detected with Chandra
in thirteen nearby elliptical galaxies. We use a novel technique to search for
faint optical counterparts in the HST images whereby we subtract the bright
galaxy light based on isophotal modeling of the surface brightness. We show
that for six sources with no detectable optical emission at the 3$-$sigma
level, their black hole masses M_{BH} < 5000Msun. In particular, an
ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 4486 has M_{BH} < 1244 Msun. We
discuss the potential of this method to provide stringent constraints on the
black hole masses, and the implications on the physical nature of these
sources.

constitutes an important goal at XFEL facilities. A simple scheme to obtain
circular polarization control with crossed undulators has been proposed so far.
In its simplest configuration the crossed undulators consist of pair of short
planar undulators in crossed position separated by an electromagnetic phase
shifter. An advantage of this configuration is a fast helicity switching. A
drawback is that a high degree of circular polarization (over 90%) can only be
achieved for lengths of the insertion devices significantly shorter than the
gain length, i.e. at output power significantly lower than the saturation power
level. The obvious and technically possible extension considered in this paper,
is to use a setup with two or more crossed undulators separated by phase
shifters. This cascade crossed undulator scheme is distinguished, in
performance, by a fast helicity switching, a high degree of circular
polarization (over 95%) and a high output power level, comparable with the
saturation power level in the baseline undulator at fundamental wavelength. We
present feasibility study and exemplifications for the LCLS baseline in the
soft X-ray regime.

comb model and the elastic single-file, which are examples of systems with
subdiffusive transport properties. The relevance of non-equilibrium conditions
is investigated: when a stationary current (in the form of a drift or an energy
flux) is present, the Einstein relation breaks down, as is known to happen in
systems with standard diffusion. In the case of the comb model, a general
relation, which has appeared in the recent literature, between the response
function and an unperturbed suitable correlation function, allows us to explain
the observed results. This suggests that a relevant ingredient in breaking the
Einstein formula, for stationary regimes, is not the anomalous diffusion but
the presence of currents driving the system out of equilibrium.

underlying assumption is that the Very High Energy (VHE) spectrum corrected for
the absorption of TeV photons by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) via
photon-photon interaction should still be softer than the extrapolation of the
gamma-ray spectrum observed by Fermi/LAT. Starting from the observed spectral
data at VHE, the EBL-corrected spectra are derived as a function of the
redshift z and fitted with power laws. Comparing the redshift dependent VHE
slopes with the power law fits to the LAT data an upper limit to the source
redshift can be derived. The method is applied to all TeV blazars detected by
LAT with known distance and an empirical law describing the relation between
the upper limits and the true redshifts is derived. This law can be used to
estimate the distance of unknown redshift blazars: as an example, the distance
of PKS 1424+240 is inferred.

two recently proposed compressed sensing (CS) techniques for the acquisition of

from sampling discrete, finite dimensional signals to sampling continuous and
possibly infinite dimensional ones, and thus establish the ability to capture
these signals at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The RD and the MWC have remarkably
similar structures (similar block diagrams), but their reconstruction
algorithms and signal models strongly differ. To date, few results exist that
compare these systems, and owing to the potential impacts they could have on
spectral estimation in applications like electromagnetic scanning and cognitive
radio, we more fully investigate their relationship in this paper. We show that
the RD and the MWC are both based on the general concept of random filtering,
but employ significantly different sampling functions. We also investigate
system sensitivities (or robustness) to sparse signal model assumptions.
Lastly, we show that ""block convolution"" is a fundamental aspect of the MWC,
allowing it to successfully sample and reconstruct block-sparse (multiband)
signals. Based on this concept, we propose a new acquisition system for
continuous-time signals whose amplitudes are block sparse. The paper includes
detailed time and frequency domain analyses of the RD and the MWC that differ,

the non-smooth framework: contacts between people are not anticipated and
avoided, they actually occur, and they are explicitly taken into account in the
model. We limit our approach to very basic principles in terms of behavior, to
focus on the particular problems raised by the non-smooth character of the
models. We consider that individuals tend to move according to a desired, or
spontanous, velocity. We account for congestion by assuming that the evolution
realizes at each time an instantaneous balance between individual tendencies
and global constraints (overlapping is forbidden): the actual velocity is
defined as the closest to the desired velocity among all admissible ones, in a
least square sense. We develop those principles in the microscopic and
macroscopic settings, and we present how the framework of Wasserstein distance
between measures allows to recover the sweeping process nature of the problem
on the macroscopic level, which makes it possible to obtain existence results
in spite of the non-smooth character of the evolution process. Micro and macro
approaches are compared, and we investigate the similarities together with deep
differences of those two levels of description.

  flexibility in a dynamic and uncertain world",,,,,"nlin.AO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Engineered systems are designed to deftly operate under predetermined
conditions yet are notoriously fragile when unexpected perturbations arise. In
contrast, biological systems operate in a highly flexible manner; learn quickly
adequate responses to novel conditions, and evolve new routines/traits to
remain competitive under persistent environmental change. A recent theory on
the origins of biological flexibility has proposed that degeneracy - the
existence of multi-functional components with partially overlapping functions -
is a primary determinant of the robustness and adaptability found in evolved
systems. While degeneracy's contribution to biological flexibility is well
documented, there has been little investigation of degeneracy design principles
for achieving flexibility in systems engineering. Actually, the conditions that
can lead to degeneracy are routinely eliminated in engineering design.
  With the planning of transportation vehicle fleets taken as a case study,
this paper reports evidence that degeneracy improves robustness and
adaptability of a simulated fleet without incurring costs to efficiency. We
find degeneracy dramatically increases robustness of a fleet to unpredicted
changes in the environment while it also facilitates robustness to anticipated
variations. When we allow a fleet's architecture to be adapted in response to
environmental change, we find degeneracy can be selectively acquired, leading
to faster rates of design adaptation and ultimately to better designs. Given
the range of conditions where favorable short-term and long-term performance
outcomes are observed, we propose that degeneracy design principles
fundamentally alter the propensity for adaptation and may be useful within
several engineering and planning contexts.

one- dimensional superlattices (SLs) on single-layer and bilayer graphene. In
single-layer graphene, for certain SL parameters an electron beam incident on a
SL is highly collimated. On the other hand there are extra Dirac points
generated for other SL parameters. Using rectangular barriers allows us to find
analytic expressions for the location of new Dirac points in the spectrum and
for the renormalization of the electron velocities. The influence of these
extra Dirac points on the conductivity is investigated. In the limit of
{\delta}-function barriers, the transmission T through, conductance G of a
finite number of barriers as well as the energy spectra of SLs are periodic
functions of the dimensionless strength P of the barriers, P{\delta}(x) ~ V
(x). For a Kronig-Penney SL with alternating sign of the height of the barriers
the Dirac point becomes a Dirac line for P = {\pi}/2 + n{\pi} with n an
integer. In bilayer graphene, with an appropriate bias applied to the barriers
and wells, we show that several new types of SLs are produced and two of them
are similar to type I and type II semiconductor SLs. Similar as in single-layer
graphene extra ""Dirac"" points are found. Non-ballistic transport is also
considered.

and $X\subset R^n$ as well as $Y_\x\subset R^p$, $x\in X$, are compact basic
semi-algebraic sets. To approximate $f^*$ we proceed in two steps. First, we
use the ""joint+marginal"" approach of the author to approximate from above the
function $x\mapsto\Phi(x)=\sup \{g(x,y): y\in Y_x\}$ by a polynomial
$\Phi_d\geq\Phi$, of degree at most $2d$, with the strong property that
$\Phi_d$ converges to $\Phi$ for the $L_1$-norm, as $d\to\infty$ (and in
particular, almost uniformly for some subsequence $(d_\ell)$, $\ell\in\N$).
Then we solve the polynomial optimization problem $f^*_d=\min_{x\in X} \{f(x):
\Phi_d(x)\leq0\}$ via a (by now standard) hierarchy of semidefinite
relaxations. It turns out that the optimal value $f^*_d\geq f^*$ converges to
$f^*$ as $d\to\infty$. In practice we let $d$ be fixed, small, and relax the
constraint $\Phi_d\leq0$ to $\Phi_d(x)\leq\epsilon$ with $\epsilon>0$, allowing
to change $\epsilon$ dynamically.

observe. Consequently, their origin, physical properties and number density are
not well known. After a first search for fLSBs in the highly substructured Coma
cluster, we present here a search for fLSBs in Abell 496. This cluster appears
to be much more relaxed than Coma, but is embedded in a large scale filament of
galaxies. Our aim is to compare the properties of fLSBs in these two very
different clusters, to search for environmental effects. Based on deep
CFHT/Megacam images in the u*, g', r' and i' bands, we selected galaxies with
r'>21 and surface brightness > 24 mag/arcsec-2. We estimated photometric
redshifts for all these galaxies and kept the 142 fLSBs with photo-z<0.2. In a
g'-i' versus i' color-magnitude diagram, we find that a large part of these
fLSBs follow the red sequence (RS) of brighter galaxies. The fLSBs within
+-1sigma of the RS show a homogeneous spatial distribution, while those above
the RS appear to be concentrated along the large scale filament of galaxies.
These properties are interpreted as agreeing with the idea that RS fLSBs are
formed in groups prior to cluster assembly. The formation of red fLSBs could be
related to infalling galaxies.

Arguing via the signature of a permutation, we demonstrate the impossibility of

duals. A central feature of these theories is the existence of a low-lying
sector of operators whose correlators factorize. We demonstrate that
factorization can only hold in the large central charge limit. Using conformal
invariance and factorization we argue that these operators are naturally
represented as fields in AdS as this makes the underlying linearity of the
system manifest. In this class of CFTs the solution of the conformal bootstrap
conditions can be naturally organized in structures which coincide with Witten
diagrams in the bulk. The large value of the central charge suggests that the
theory must include a large number of new operators not captured by the
factorized sector. Consequently we may think of the AdS hologram as an
effective representation of a small sector of the CFT, which is embedded inside
a much larger Hilbert space corresponding to the black hole microstates.

spanned by the local versions of the Minkowski functionals (or fundamental
measures): volume, surface, integral mean curvature, and Euler characteristic,
of an underlying three-dimensional geometry. A bilinear combination of the
measures is used as a (pseudo) metric with ++-- signature, represented by a 4x4
matrix with unit entries on the counter diagonal. Six different types of linear
automorphisms are shown to leave the metric invariant. Their generators form a
Lie algebra that can be grouped into two mutually commuting triples with
non-trivial structure constants. We supplement these six isometric operations
by further ten transformations that have a metamorphic (altering) effect on the
underlying geometry. When grouped together, four different linear combinations
of the metamorphic generators form a previously obtained third-rank tensor.
This is shown to describe four different types of mutually commuting ""shifting""
operations in fundamental measure space. The relevance for fundamental measures

radionuclides Al-26 and Fe-60 to determine (i) the timescale on which melting
will occur; (ii) the minimum size of a body that will produce silicate melt and
differentiate; (iii) the migration rate of molten material within the interior;
and (iv) the thermal consequences of the transport of Al-26 in partial melt.
Our models incorporate results from previous studies of planetary
differentiation and are constrained by petrologic (i.e. grain size
distributions), isotopic (e.g. Pb-Pb and Hf-W ages) and mineralogical
properties of differentiated achondrites. We show that formation of a basaltic
crust via melt percolation was limited by the formation time of the body,
matrix grain size and viscosity of the melt. We show that low viscosity (< 1
Pa-s) silicate melt can buoyantly migrate on a timescale comparable to the mean
life of Al-26. The equilibrium partitioning of Al into silicate partial melt
and the migration of that melt acts to dampen internal temperatures. However,
subsequent heating from the decay of Fe-60 generated melt fractions in excess
of 50%, thus completing differentiation for bodies that accreted within 2 Myr
of CAI formation (i.e. the onset of isotopic decay). Migration and
concentration of Al-26 into a crust results in remelting of that crust for
accretion times less than 2 Myr and for bodies >100 km in size. Differentiation
would be most likely for planetesimals larger than 20 km in diameter that
accreted within ~2.7 Myr of CAI formation.

invariant densities, i.e. fixed points of an associated transfer operator. In
addition, global slowly mixing structures, such as almost-invariant sets, which
partition phase space into regions that are almost dynamically disconnected,
can also be identified by certain eigenfunctions of this operator. Indeed,
these structures are often hard to obtain by brute-force trajectory-based
analyses. In a wide variety of applications, transfer operators have proven to
be very efficient tools for an analysis of the global behavior of a dynamical
system.
  The computationally most expensive step in the construction of an approximate
transfer operator is the numerical integration of many short term trajectories.
In this paper, we propose to directly work with the infinitesimal generator
instead of the operator, completely avoiding trajectory integration. We propose
two different discretization schemes; a cell based discretization and a
spectral collocation approach. Convergence can be shown in certain
circumstances. We demonstrate numerically that our approach is much more
efficient than the operator approach, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.
