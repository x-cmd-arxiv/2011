transverse Ising model. The model consists of a set of 7 localized spin-1/2
particles in a two dimensional triangular lattice coupled through nearest
neighbor exchange interaction in presence of an external time dependent
magnetic field. The magnetic field is applied in different function forms:
step, exponential, hyperbolic and periodic. We found that the time evolution of
the entanglement shows an ergodic behavior under the effect of the time
dependent magnetic fields. Also we found that while the step magnetic field
causes great disturbance to the system creating rabid oscillations, the system
shows great controllability under the effect of the other magnetic fields where
the entanglement profile follows closely the shape of the applied field even
with the same frequency for periodic fields. This follow up trend breaks down
as the strength of the field, the transition constant for exponential and
hyperbolic, or frequency for periodic field increase leading to rapid
oscillations. We observed that the entanglement is very sensitive to the
initial value of the applied periodic field, the smaller the initial value the
less distorted is the entanglement profile. Furthermore, the effect of thermal
fluctuations is very devastating to the entanglement which decays very rapidly
as the temperature increases. Interestingly, although large value of the
magnetic field strength may yield small entanglement, it was found to be more
persistent against thermal fluctuations than the small field strengths.

sensing (SCS), that aims at efficiently sampling a collection of signals that
follow a statistical distribution, and achieving accurate reconstruction on
average, is introduced. SCS based on Gaussian models is investigated in depth.
For signals that follow a single Gaussian model, with Gaussian or Bernoulli
sensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably smaller than the O(k
log(N/k)) required by conventional CS based on sparse models, where N is the
signal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented via linear filtering,
significantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the
error of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term
approximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is
also significantly smaller than that of conventional sparsity-oriented CS.
Stronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the
error of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term
approximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently
calculated. For Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), that assume multiple Gaussian
distributions and that each signal follows one of them with an unknown index, a
piecewise linear estimator is introduced to decode SCS. The accuracy of model
selection, at the heart of the piecewise linear decoder, is analyzed in terms
of the properties of the Gaussian distributions and the number of sensing
measurements. A maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm that
iteratively estimates the Gaussian models parameters, the signals model
selection, and decodes the signals, is presented for GMM-based SCS. In real
image sensing applications, GMM-based SCS is shown to lead to improved results
compared to conventional CS, at a considerably lower computational cost.

a dynamical quasiparticle model for partons (DQPM) matched to reproduce recent
lattice-QCD results from the Wuppertal-Budapest group in thermodynamic
equilibrium. The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is
described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs

current-conservation, color neutrality as well as energy-momentum conservation.
Our dynamical studies for heavy-ion collisions at relativistic collider

experimental data from the STAR, PHENIX, BRAHMS and PHOBOS collaborations for

reasonable reproduction of hadron rapidity distributions and transverse mass
spectra and also a fair description of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons as
a function of the centrality of the reaction and the transverse momentum $p_T$.
Furthermore, an approximate quark-number scaling of the elliptic flow $v_2$ of

users when the feasible transmission rate of each user varies randomly over
time. Time is slotted and users arrive and depart upon service completion. This
may model for example the flow-level behavior of end-users in a narrowband HDR
wireless channel (CDMA 1xEV-DO). As performance criteria we consider the
stability of the system and the mean delay experienced by the users. Given the
complexity of the problem we investigate the fluid-scaled system, which allows
to obtain important results and insights for the original system: (1) We
characterize for a large class of scheduling policies the stability conditions
and identify a set of maximum stable policies, giving in each time slot
preference to users being in their best possible channel condition. We find in
particular that many opportunistic scheduling policies like Score-Based,
Proportionally Best or Potential Improvement are stable under the maximum
stability conditions, whereas the opportunistic scheduler Relative-Best or the
cmu-rule are not. (2) We show that choosing the right tie-breaking rule is
crucial for the performance (e.g. average delay) as perceived by a user. We
prove that a policy is asymptotically optimal if it is maximum stable and the
tie-breaking rule gives priority to the user with the highest departure
probability. We will refer to such tie-breaking rule as myopic. (3) We derive
the growth rates of the number of users in the system in overload settings
under various policies, which give additional insights on the performance. (4)
We conclude that simple priority-index policies with the myopic tie-breaking
rule, are stable and asymptotically optimal. All our findings are validated

from source to image coordinates that is nonlinear and cannot generally be
inverted analytically. Determining the structure of the source intensity
distribution also requires a description of the blurring effect due to a point
spread function. This initial study uses an iterative gravitational lens
modeling scheme based on the semilinear method to determine the linear
parameters (source intensity profile) of a strongly lensed system. Our
'matrix-free' approach avoids construction of the lens and blurring operators
while retaining the least squares formulation of the problem. The parameters of
an analytical lens model are found through nonlinear optimization by an
advanced genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimizer (PSO). These
global optimization routines are designed to explore the parameter space
thoroughly, mapping model degeneracies in detail. We develop a novel method
that determines the L-curve for each solution automatically, which represents
the trade-off between the image chi-square and regularization effects, and
allows an estimate of the optimally regularized solution for each lens
parameter set. In the final step of the optimization procedure, the lens model
with the lowest chi-square is used while the global optimizer solves for the
source intensity distribution directly. This allows us to accurately determine
the number of degrees of freedom in the problem to facilitate comparison
between lens models and enforce positivity on the source profile. In practice
we find that the GA conducts a more thorough search of the parameter space than
the PSO.

Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, to evaluate the selectivity (output cardinality)
of SQL queries - a crucial step in optimizing the execution of large scale
database and data-mining operations. The major theoretical contribution of this
work, which is of independent interest, is an explicit bound to the
VC-dimension of a range space defined by all possible outcomes of a collection
(class) of queries. We prove that the VC-dimension is a function of the maximum
number of Boolean operations in the selection predicate and of the maximum
number of select and join operations in any individual query in the collection,
but it is neither a function of the number of queries in the collection nor of
the size (number of tuples) of the database. We leverage on this result and
develop a method that, given a class of queries, builds a concise random sample
of a database, such that with high probability the execution of any query in
the class on the sample provides an accurate estimate for the selectivity of
the query on the original large database. The error probability holds
simultaneously for the selectivity estimates of all queries in the collection,
thus the same sample can be used to evaluate the selectivity of multiple
queries, and the sample needs to be refreshed only following major changes in
the database. The sample representation computed by our method is typically
sufficiently small to be stored in main memory. We present extensive
experimental results, validating our theoretical analysis and demonstrating the
advantage of our technique when compared to complex selectivity estimation
techniques used in PostgreSQL and the Microsoft SQL Server.

distribution of family sizes and the nonlinear scaling of the number of genes

In addition, it allows us to derive a novel relation between the exponents
characterising these two scaling laws, establishing a direct quantitative
connection between evolutionary and functional categories. It predicts that
functional categories that grow faster-than-linearly with genome size to be
characterised by flatter-than-average family size distributions. This relation
is confirmed by our bioinformatics analysis of prokaryotic genomes. This proves
that the joint quantitative trends of functional and evolutionary classes can

also by some additional variables. In the non-relativistic pilot-wave theory of
de Broglie and Bohm those variables are particle positions. In the context of
quantum field theory, there are two natural choices, namely particle positions
and fields. The incorporation of those variables makes it possible to provide
an objective description of nature in which rather ambiguous notions such as
`measurement' and `observer' play no fundamental role. As such, the theory is
free of the conceptual difficulties, such as the measurement problem, that

between charged-neutral diblock copolymers and oppositely charged nanocolloids.
We show that nanocolloids such as surfactant micelles and iron oxide magnetic
nanoparticles share similar properties when mixed with charged-neutral
diblocks. Above a critical charge ratio, core-shell hierarchical structures
form spontaneously under direct mixing conditions. The core-shell structures
are identified by a combination of small-angle scattering techniques and
transmission electron microscopy. The formation of multi-level objects is
driven by the electrostatic attraction between opposite charges and by the
release of the condensed counterions. Alternative mixing processes inspired
from molecular biology are also described. The protocols applied here consist
in screening the electrostatic interactions of the mixed dispersions, and then
removing the salt progressively as example by dialysis. With these techniques,
the oppositely charged species are intimately mixed before they can interact,
and their association is monitored by the desalting kinetics. As a result,
sphere- and rod-like aggregates with remarkable superparamagnetic and stability
properties are obtained. These findings are discussed in the light of a new
paradigm which deals with the possibility to use inorganic nanoparticles as
building blocks for the design and fabrication of supracolloidal assemblies
with enhanced functionalities.

flux-limited sample of flat spectrum radio-emitting quasars with jet-like
extended structure. X-rays are detected from 24 of the 39 jets observed so far.
We compute the distribution of alpha_rx, the spectral index between the X-ray
and radio bands, showing that it is broad, extending at least from 0.8 to 1.2.
While there is a general trend that the radio brightest jets are detected most
often, it is clear that predicting the X-ray flux from the radio knot flux
densities is risky so a shallow X-ray survey is the most effective means for
finding jets that are X-ray bright. We test the model in which the X-rays
result from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) photons by relativistic electrons in the jet moving with high bulk
Lorentz factor nearly along the line of sight. Depending on how the jet
magnetic fields vary with z, the observed X-ray to radio flux ratios do not
follow the redshift dependence expected from the IC-CMB model. For a subset of
our sample with known superluminal motion based on VLBI observations, we
estimate the angle of the kpc-scale jet to the line of sight by considering the
additional information in the bends observed between pc- and kpc-scale jets.
These angles are sometimes much smaller than estimates based on the IC-CMB
model with a Lorentz factor of 15, indicating that these jets may decelerate
significantly from pc scales to kpc scales.

calculations of core-less giant planets that have attained their asymptotic
radii, and which have been tabulated for a range of planet masses and
equilibrium temperatures. (We report a two-dimensional polynomial fitting
function that accurately represents the models). As expected, the model radii
provide a statistically significant improvement over a null hypothesis that the
sizes of giant planets are completely independent of mass and effective
temperature. As is well known, however, fiducial models provide an insufficient
explanation; the planetary radius anomalies are strongly correlated with
planetary equilibrium temperature. We find that the radius anomalies have a
best-fit dependence, ${\cal R}\propto T_{\rm eff}^{\alpha}$, with
$\alpha=1.4\pm0.6$. Incorporating this relation into the model radii leads to
substantially less scatter in the radius correlation. The extra temperature
dependence represents an important constraint on theoretical models for Hot
Jupiters. Using simple scaling arguments, we find support for the hypothesis of
Batygin and Stevenson (2010) that this correlation can be attributed to a
planetary heating mechanism that is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic coupling
between the planetary magnetic field and near-surface flow that is accompanied
by ohmic dissipation at adiabatic depth. Additionally, we find that the
temperature dependence is likely too strong to admit kinetic heating as the
primary source of anomalous energy generation within the majority of the
observed transiting planets.

$\phi\in\Gamma(M,\End(TM))$ such that $\phi^3+\phi=0$. Any $f$-structure $\phi$
determines an almost CR structure $E_{1,0}\subset T_\C M$ given by the
$+i$-eigenbundle of $\phi$. Using a compatible metric $g$ and connection
$\nabla$ on $M$, we construct an odd first-order differential operator $D$,
acting on sections of $\S=\Lambda E_{0,1}^*$, whose principal symbol is of the
type considered in arXiv:0810.0338. In the special case of a CR-integrable
almost $\S$-structure, we show that when $\nabla$ is the generalized

index-theoretic approach involving the operator $D$; for certain group actions
$D$ will be transversally elliptic, and using the results in arXiv:0810.0338,
we can give a Riemann-Roch type formula for its index. The second approach uses
an analogue of the polarized sections of a prequantum line bundle, with a CR
structure playing the role of a complex polarization.

Isotherms of magnetoresistance, rather than resistance, vs. field were found to
cross at a well-defined magnetic field higher than the field corresponding to
the peak in R(B). For all values of B, R(T) was found to obey an Arrhenius
form. At the crossover magnetic field the prefactor became equal to the quantum

an anisotropy can result from the initial rapid longitudinal expansion of the
matter. A phenomenological model for the space time evolution of the

141943 were obtained at three observing epochs (2007, 2009 and 2010). The
observations were obtained using the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian telescope with the
UCLES echelle spectrograph and the SEMPOL spectropolarimeter visitor
instrument. The brightness and surface magnetic field topologies (given in
Paper I) were used to determine the star's surface differential rotation and
reconstruct the coronal magnetic field of the star.
  The coronal magnetic field at the 3 epochs shows on the largest scales that
the field structure is dominated by the dipole component with possible evidence
for the tilt of the dipole axis shifting between observations. We find very
high levels of differential rotation on HD 141943 (~8 times the solar value for
the magnetic features and ~5 times solar for the brightness features) similar
to that evidenced by another young early-G star, HD 171488. These results
indicate that a significant increase in the level of differential rotation
occurs for young stars around a spectral type of early-G. Also we find for the
2010 observations that there is a large difference in the differential rotation
measured from the brightness and magnetic features, similar to that seen on
early-K stars, but with the difference being much larger. We find only
tentative evidence for temporal evolution in the differential rotation of HD
141943.

  mathematical journal","Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras, vol. 5, pp. 1-40, (1995)",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distributed system $\mathcal{S}_D$ described by the Dirac equation is
investigated simply as a dynamic system, i.e. without usage of quantum
principles. The Dirac equation is described in terms of hydrodynamic variables:
4-flux $j^{i}$, pseudo-vector of the spin $S^{i}$, an action $\hbar \phi $ and
a pseudo-scalar $\kappa $. In the quasi-uniform approximation, when all
transversal derivatives (orthogonal to the flux vector $j^i$) are small, the
system $\mathcal{S}_D$ turns to a statistical ensemble of classical
concentrated systems $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$. Under some conditions the classical
system $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$ describes a classical pointlike particle moving in a
given electromagnetic field. In general, the world line of the particle is a
helix, even if the electromagnetic field is absent. Both dynamic systems
$\mathcal{S}_D$ and $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$ appear to be non-relativistic in the
sense that the dynamic equations written in terms of hydrodynamic variables are
not relativistically covariant with respect to them, although all dynamic
variables are tensors or pseudo-tensors. They becomes relativistically
covariant only after addition of a constant unit timelike vector $f^{i}$ which
should be considered as a dynamic variable describing a space-time property.
This ""constant"" variable arises instead of $\gamma $-matrices which are removed
by means of zero divizors in the course of the transformation to hydrodynamic
variables. It is possible to separate out dynamic variables $\kappa $, $\kappa
^i$ responsible for quantum effects. It means that, setting $\kappa ,\kappa
^i\equiv 0$, the dynamic system $\mathcal{S}_D$ described by the Dirac equation
turns to a statistical ensemble $\mathcal{E}_{Dqu}$ of classical dynamic
systems $\mathcal{S}_{dc}$.

an in-chain interaction between nearest-neighbor spins and a cross-chain
interaction between instantaneously opposite spins. For velocities v>0 the
system, subject to a suitable markovian dynamics at a temperature T, can reach
only a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). This system was introduced by Hucht
et al., who showed that for v=\infty it undergoes a para- to ferromagnetic
transition, essentially due to the fact that each chain exerts an effective
field on the other one. The present study of the v=\infty case determines the
consequences of the fluctuations of this effective field when the system size N
is finite. We show that whereas to leading order the system obeys detailed
balancing with respect to an effective time-independent Hamiltonian, the higher
order finite-size corrections violate detailed balancing. Expressions are given
to various orders in 1/N for the interaction free energy between the chains,
the spontaneous magnetization, the in-chain and cross-chain spin-spin
correlations, and the spontaneus magnetization. It is shown how finite-size
scaling functions may be derived explicitly. This study was motivated by recent
work on a two-lane traffic problem in which a similar phase transition was

Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. These three different populations correspond to evolved
phases of Main Sequence (MS) OB stars. Axial rotation and mass loss have a
great influence on massive star evolution in general and more specifically on
the durations of these different phases. Moderate rotation and mass loss,
during the MS phase, favor the evolution towards the RSG stage. Fast rotation
and strong mass loss during the MS phase, in contrast, prevent the star from
becoming a RSG and allow the star to pass directly from the OB star phase into
the WR phase. Mass loss during the RSG stage may make the star evolve back in
the blue part of the HR diagram. We argue that such an evolution may be more
common than presently accounted for in stellar models. This might be the reason
for the lack of type IIP SNe with RSG progenitors having initial masses between
18 and 30 M$_\odot$. The LBVs do appear as a possible transition phase between
O and WR stars or between WNL and WNE stars. Fast rotation and/or strong mass
loss during the Main-Sequence phase prevent the formation of LBV stars. The
mechanisms driving the very strong ejections shown by LBV stars are still
unknown. (abridged)

study corresponding constraints on gamma-ray emissions from two specific
decaying dark matter models, one via grand unification scale suppressed
operators and the other via R-parity violating operators. Both can account for
the PAMELA and Fermi-LAT excesses of e^\pm. For GUT decaying dark matter, the
gamma-rays from the M49 and Fornax clusters, with energy in the range of 1 to
10 GeV, lead to the most stringent constraints to date. As a result, this dark
matter is disfavored with conventional model of e^\pm background. In addition,
it is likely that some tension exists between the Fermi-LAT e^\pm excess and
the gamma ray constraints for any decaying dark matter model, provided
conventional model of e^\pm background is adopted. Nevertheless, the GUT
decaying dark matter can still solely account for the PAMELA positron fraction
excess without violating the gamma-ray constraints. For the gravitino dark
matter model with R-parity violation, cluster observations do not give tight
constraints. This is because a different e^\pm background has been adopted
which leads to relatively light dark matter mass around 200 GeV.

or higher in at least one of the CO rotational lines. Even though there are no
giant molecular clouds beyond 4kpc in M33, our deep observations have revealed
that clouds of smaller mass are very common. Sources which are known to be
evolved variable stars show weaker or undetectable CO lines. Evolved stars
occupy a well defined region of the IRAC color-color diagrams. Star forming
regions are scattered throughout a larger area even though the bulk of the
distribution has different IRAC colors than evolved variable stars. We estimate
that about half of the 24 micron sources without an Halpha counterpart are
genuine embedded star forming regions. Sources with faint but compact Halpha
emission have an incomplete Initial Mass Function (IMF) at the high-mass end
and are compatible with a population of young clusters with a stochastically
sampled, universal IMF.

found in many complex systems. However, rather than universality with a single
power-law exponent (equal to 1 for Zipf's law), there are many reported
deviations that remain unexplained. A recently developed theory finds that the
interplay between (i) one of the most universal ingredients, namely stochastic
proportional growth, and (ii) birth and death processes, leads to a generic
power-law distribution with an exponent that depends on the characteristics of
each ingredient. Here, we report the first complete empirical test of the
theory and its application, based on the empirical analysis of the dynamics of
market shares in the product market. We estimate directly the average growth
rate of market shares and its standard deviation, the birth rates and the
""death"" (hazard) rate of products. We find that temporal variations and product
differences of the observed power-law exponents can be fully captured by the
theory with no adjustable parameters. Our results can be generalized to many
systems for which the statistical properties revealed by power law exponents
are directly linked to the underlying generating mechanism.

we build on experience gained in FOM.
  The main aims of our school are the following: We want to base the theory on
simple, unambiguous axioms with clear meanings. It should be absolutely
understandable for any reader what the axioms say and the reader can decide
about each axiom whether he likes it. The theory should be built up from these
axioms in a straightforward, logical manner. We want to provide an analysis of
the logical structure of the theory. We investigate which axioms are needed for
which predictions of RT. We want to make RT more transparent logically, easier
to understand, easier to change, modular, and easier to teach. We want to
obtain deeper understanding of RT.
  Our work can be considered as a case-study showing that the Vienna Circle's
(VC) approach to doing science is workable and fruitful when performed with
using the insights and tools of mathematical logic acquired since its formation
years at the very time of the VC activity. We think that logical positivism was
based on the insight and anticipation of what mathematical logic is capable
when elaborated to some depth. Logical positivism, in great part represented by
VC, influenced and took part in the birth of modern mathematical logic. The
members of VC were brave forerunners and pioneers.

expected signature of a stochastic process plays a similar role to that played
by the characteristic function of a random variable. In [Chevyrev (2013)], it
is proved that under certain boundedness conditions, the expected value of a
random signature already determines the law of this random signature. It
becomes of great interest to be able to compute examples of expected signatures
and obtain the upper bounds for the decay rates of expected signatures. For
instance, the computation for Brownian motion on $[0,1]$ leads to the
``cubature on Wiener space'' methodology [Lyons and Victoir, Proc. R. Soc.

bounded domain $\Gamma$ in a Euclidean space $E$ and study the expected
signature of a Brownian path starting at $z\in\Gamma$ and stopped at the first
exit time from $\Gamma$. We denote this tensor series valued function by
$\Phi_{\Gamma}(z)$ and focus on the case $E=\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that
$\Phi_{\Gamma}(z)$ satisfies an elliptic PDE system and a boundary condition.
The equations determining $\Phi_{\Gamma}$ can be recursively solved; by an
iterative application of Sobolev estimates we are able, under certain
smoothness and boundedness condition of the domain $\Gamma$, to prove geometric
bounds for the terms in $\Phi_{\Gamma}(z)$. However, there is still a gap and
we have not shown that $\Phi_{\Gamma}(z)$ determines the law of the signature

information or resources can only flow through paths that follow the

processes. However, since networks have so far been usually considered static
or quasi-static, the properties of temporal paths are not yet well understood.
Building on a definition and algorithmic implementation of the average temporal
distance between nodes, we study temporal paths in empirical networks of human
communication and air transport. Although temporal distances correlate with
static graph distances, there is a large spread, and nodes that appear close
from the static network view may be connected via slow paths or not at all.
Differences between static and temporal properties are further highlighted in
studies of the temporal closeness centrality. In addition, correlations and
heterogeneities in the underlying event sequences affect temporal path lengths,
increasing temporal distances in communication networks and decreasing them in
the air transport network.

the goal to select an initial good set of individuals that will promote a new

more than two colors. The multicolored version of the TSS can be described as
follows: let $G$ be a torus where every node is assigned a color from a finite
set of colors. At each local time step, each node can recolor itself, depending
on the local configurations, with the color held by the majority of its
neighbors. We study the initial distributions of colors leading the system to a
monochromatic configuration of color $k$, focusing on the minimum number of
initial $k$-colored nodes. We conclude the paper by providing the time
complexity to achieve the monochromatic configuration.

as the electrical wires of the thermometer itself. Differential measurements
allow easy monitoring of temperature drifts in the cryogenic environment. The
technique is rapid to use and easily calibrated. Preliminary results will be

the correlations between the projections are maximized. The solution is
invariant to any linear transformation of either or both of the views; for

approximated by a density expansion in the spirit of the density functional

quasi-ordered structural model of the compound in the framework of the local
density approximation. Spin-polarized KKR calculations confirm that weak
ferromagnetic properties of Y$_4$Co$_3$ can be attributed to only one cobalt
atom located on (2b) site in the unit cell, while other twenty Co and Y atoms
acts as a diamagnetic environment. Moreover, the magnetic Co atoms form a
quasi-one-dimensional chains along $z$ direction. The magnitude of Co(2b)
magnetic moment ($0.55~\mu_B$) markedly overestimates the experimental value
(0.23~$\mu_B$), which suggests the importance of spin fluctuations in this

a background for discussion of the coexistence of ferromagnetism and

We have exposed the as-grown nanocomposites to low energy electron beam
irradiation and we have measured the electrical conductivity as a function of
the irradiation dose. Postgrowth electron beam irradiation transforms the
matrix microstructure and thus the strength of the tunneling coupling between
Pt nanocrystallites. For as-grown samples (weak tunnel coupling regime) we find
that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity follows the
stretched exponential behavior characteristic of the correlated variable-range
hopping transport regime. For briefly irradiated samples (strong tunnel
coupling regime) the electrical conductivity is tuned across the
metal-insulator transition. For long-time irradiated samples the electrical
conductivity behaves like that of a metal. In order to further analyze changes
of the microstructure as a function of the electron irradiation dose we have
carried out transmission electron microscope (TEM), micro-Raman and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) investigations. TEM pictures reveal that the
crystallites' size of long-time irradiated samples is larger than that of
as-grown samples. Furthermore we do not have evidence of microstructural
changes in briefly irradiated samples. By means of micro-Raman we find that by
increasing the irradiation dose the matrix changes following a graphitization
trajectory between amorphous carbon and nanocrystalline graphite. Finally, by

momentum into separate quark and gluon contributions, and as to whether the
gluon angular momentum can itself be split, in a gauge invariant way, into a
spin and orbital part. Several authors have proposed various answers to these
questions and offered a variety of different expressions for the relevant
operators. I argue that none of these is acceptable and suggest that the
canonical expression for the momentum and angular momentum operators is the
correct and physically meaningful one. It is then an inescapable fact that the
gluon angular momentum operator cannot, in general, be split in a gauge
invariant way into a spin and orbital part. However, the projection of the
gluon spin onto its direction of motion i.e. its helicity is gauge invariant
and is measured in deep inelastic scattering on nucleons. The Ji sum rule,
relating the quark angular momentum to generalized parton distributions, though
not based on the canonical operators, is shown to be correct, if interpreted
with due care. I also draw attention to several interesting aspects of QED and
QCD, which, to the best of my knowledge, are not commented upon in the standard
textbooks on Field Theory.

ideal instrument for measuring the parallax of pulsars, because it has a very
high sensitivity, as well as baselines extending up to several thousands of
kilometres. We performed simulations to estimate the number of pulsars for
which the parallax can be measured with the SKA and the distance to which a
parallax can be measured. We compare two different methods. The first method
measures the parallax directly by utilising the long baselines of the SKA to
form high angular resolution images. The second method uses the arrival times
of the radio signals of pulsars to fit a transformation between time
coordinates in the terrestrial frame and the comoving pulsar frame directly
yielding the parallax. We find that with the first method a parallax with an
accuracy of 20% or less can be measured up to a maximum distance of 13 kpc,
which would include 9,000 pulsars. By timing pulsars with the most stable
arrival times for the radio emission, parallaxes can be measured for about

scaling behavior in the World Wide Web, but this explanation has been
challenged by the global information hypothesis, the existence of linear
preference and the emergence of new big internet companies in the real world.
We notice that most websites have an obvious feature that their pages are
organized as a tree (namely hidden tree) and hence propose a new model that
introduces a hidden tree structure into the Erd\H{o}s-R\'e}yi model by adding a
new rule: when one node connects to another, it should also connect to all
nodes in the path between these two nodes in the hidden tree. The experimental
results show that the degree distribution of the generated graphs would obey
power law distributions and have variable high clustering coefficients and
variable small average lengths of shortest paths. The proposed model provides
an alternative explanation to the emergence of scaling in the World Wide Web
without the above-mentioned difficulties, and also explains the ""preferential
attachment"" phenomenon.

these tessellations are constructed by means of a spatio-temporal random
recursive split dynamics governed by a family of Markovian split kernel,
generalizing thereby the -- by now classical -- construction of iteration
stable random tessellations. By providing an explicit global construction of

tessellation-valued Markov process of stationary random tessellations
compatible with the given split kernels. Beside the existence and uniqueness

yields a holographic $c$-function in domain-wall backgrounds, and seemingly
generalizes the concept for black hole geometries. A flow equation equates the
monotonicity properties of $\mathcal N$ with the gravitational field, which has
opposite signs in the domain-wall and black hole backgrounds, due to the
presence of negative/positive energy in the former/latter, and accordingly
$\mathcal N$ monotonically decreases/increases from the UV to the IR. On $AdS$
spaces the $\mathcal N$-function is related to the Euler anomaly, and at a
black hole horizon it is generically proportional to the entropy. For planar
black holes, $\mathcal N$ diverges at the horizon, which we interpret as an
order $N^2$ increase in the number of effective degrees of freedom. We show how
$\mathcal N$ can be written as the ratio of the Wald entropy to an effective
phase space volume, and using the flow equation relate this to Verlinde's
notion of gravity as an entropic force. From the effective phase space we can
obtain an expression for the dual field theory momentum cut-off, matching a
previous proposal in the literature by Polchinski and Heemskerk. Finally, we
propose that the area in Planck units counts states, not degrees of freedom,
and identify it also as a phase space volume. Written in terms of the proper
radial distance $\beta$, it takes the suggestive form of a canonical partition
function at inverse temperature $\beta$, leading to a ""mean energy"" which is
simply the extrinsic curvature of the surface. Using this we relate this
definition of holographic phase space with the effective phase space appearing
in the $\mathcal N$-function.

to be a half-metallic antiferromagnet. Thin films of the quaternary compounds
with x = 0...2 were prepared by DC and RF magnetron co-sputtering on heated MgO
(001) substrates. The magnetic structure was examined by x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism and the chemical disorder was characterized by x-ray
diffraction. Ferrimagnetic coupling of V to Mn was observed for Mn2VAl (x = 0).
For x = 0.5, we also found ferrimagnetic order with V and Co antiparallel to
Mn. The observed reduced magnetic moments are interpreted with the help of band
structure calculations in the coherent potential approximation. Mn2VAl is very
sensitive to disorder involving Mn, because nearest-neighbor Mn atoms couple
anti-ferromagnetically. Co2VAl has B2 order and has reduced magnetization. In
the cases with x >= 0.9 conventional ferromagnetism was observed, closely
related to the atomic disorder in these compounds.

driven by a spatially uniform time-dependent force is studied. Starting from
the Gross-Pitaevskii Lagrangian, the dispersion relation for linear waves and
instabilities at the interface is derived by means of a variational approach. A
number of diverse dynamical effects for different types of the driving force is
demonstrated, which includes the Rayleigh-Taylor instability for a constant
force, the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability for a pulse force, dynamic
stabilization of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and onset of the parametric
instability for an oscillating force. Gaussian Markovian and non-Markovian
stochastic forces are also considered. It is found that the Markovian
stochastic force does not produce any average effect on the dynamics of the
interface, while the non-Markovian force leads to exponential perturbation
growth.

using high-resolution numerical simulations. The (volume-preserving) flow
considered is a three-dimensional extension of the randomised alternating sine
flow employed extensively in studies of mixing in two dimensions. It is used to
show that theoretical predictions for two-dimensional flows with small
diffusivity carry over to three dimensions even though the stretching
properties differ significantly. The variance decay rate, scalar field
structure, and time evolution of statistical moments confirm that there are two
distinct regimes of scalar decay: a locally controlled regime, which applies
when the domain size is comparable to the characteristic lengthscale of the
velocity field, and a globally controlled regime, which when applies when the
domain is larger. Asymptotic predictions for the variance decay rate in both
regimes show excellent agreement with the numerical results. Consideration of
both the forward flow and its time reverse makes it possible to compare the
scalar evolution in flows with one or two expanding directions; simulations
confirm the theoretical prediction that the decay rate of the scalar is the
same in both flows, despite the very different scalar field structures.

double set of radio bubbles. The outer set spans ~7.5 kpc and is expanding into
the halo regions of the host galaxy. We present an analysis of our new Chandra
observation, together with archival XMM-Newton data, to look for evidence of
emission from shocked gas around the external radio bubbles, both from
spatially resolved regions in Chandra and from spectral analysis of the XMM
data. We also look for evidence of a variable absorbing column along our line
of sight to Mrk 6, to explain the evident differences seen in the AGN spectra
from the various, non-contemporaneous, observations.
  We find that the variable absorption hypothesis explains the differences
between the Chandra and XMM spectra, with the Chandra spectrum being heavily
absorbed. The intrinsic N_H varies from ~8x10^{21} atoms*cm^{-2} to ~3x10^{23}
atoms*cm^{-2} on short timescales (2-6 years). The past evolution of the source
suggests this is probably caused by a clump of gas close to the central AGN,
passing in front of us at the moment of the observation. Shells of thermal
X-ray emission are detected around the radio bubbles, with a temperature of
~0.9 keV. We estimate a temperature of ~0.2 keV for the external medium using
luminosity constraints from our Chandra image. We analyse these results using
the Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump conditions, and obtain a Mach number of ~3.9,
compatible with a scenario in which the gas in the shells is inducing a strong
shock in the surrounding ISM. This could be the third clear detection of strong
shocks produced by a radio-powerful Seyfert galaxy. These results are
compatible with previous findings on Centaurus A and NGC 3801, supporting a
picture in which these AGN-driven outflows play an important role in the
environment and evolution of the host galaxy.

subsequent attempts to formulate particle physics as a pure S-matrix project.
The feasibility of a pure S-matrix approach are critically analyzed and their
serious shortcomings are highlighted. Whereas the conceptual/mathematical
demands of renormalized perturbation theory are modest and misunderstandings
could easily be corrected, the correct understanding about the origin of the
crossing property requires the use of the mathematical theory of modular
localization and its relation to the thermal KMS condition. These new concepts,
which combine localization, vacuum polarization and thermal properties under
the roof of modular theory, will be explained and their potential use in a new
constructive (nonperturbative) approach to QFT will be indicated. The S-matrix
still plays a predominant role but, different from Heisenberg's and
Mandelstam's proposals, the new project is not a pure S-matrix approach. The
S-matrix plays a new role as a ""relative modular invariant""..

  demarcation possible?","Draft, 55 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper discusses the problem of demarcation between the dimensions of
natural and the human sciences in contemporary cosmology. In spite of a common
presumption that cosmology is a natural science, the specificity of its alleged
subject matter, that is the universe as a whole, makes cosmology fundamentally
different from other natural sciences. The reason is that in cosmology the
subject of cosmological research and its ""object"" are in a certain sense
inseparable. Any study of the universe involves two opposite perspectives which
can be described as ""a-cosmic"" and ""cosmic"", egocentric and non-egocentric.
Cosmology involves two languages, namely that of physical causality (pertaining
to the natural sciences) and that of intentionality (pertaining to the human
sciences). On the one hand the universe can be seen as a product of discursive
reason, that is as an abstract ""physical"" entity unfolding in space and time.
On the other hand the universe can be experienced through our participation in,
or communion with the world understood as the natural context of living beings.
This dichotomy between reason and experience, abstract construction and
concrete participation, originates in the essence of human persons understood
as unities of the corporeal and spiritual. On account of this dichotomy it is
hard to set up a strict line of demarcation between the elements of the human
and the natural sciences in cosmology. This confirms the intuition that any
realistic world view is incomplete without a knowledge of what it means to
exist as a human being. Conversely it is likewise impossible to understand
human existence without considering its natural setting, that is the universe.
We conclude that anthropology is incomplete without cosmology and vice versa.
