Also available at http://www.rssd.esa.int",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201116486","Planck Collaboration 2011b. / Planck2011-1.3","astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of the Planck instruments in space is enabled by their low
operating temperatures, 20K for LFI and 0.1K for HFI, achieved through a
combination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.
The scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to two
detector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.
Active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used by
previous cryogenic space missions (IRAS, COBE, ISO, Spitzer, AKARI), could not.
Radiative cooling is provided by three V-groove radiators and a large telescope
baffle. The active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (<20K), a 4He
Joule-Thomson cooler (4.7K), and a 3He-4He dilution cooler (1.4K and 0.1K). The
flight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space to
operating conditions. The HFI bolometer plate reached 93mK on 3 July 2009, 50
days after launch. The solar panel always faces the Sun, shadowing the rest of
Planck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384K. At the other end of the
spacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3K and the telescope primary
mirror operates at 35.9K. The temperatures of key parts of the instruments are
stabilized by both active and passive methods. Temperature fluctuations are
driven by changes in the distance from the Sun, sorption cooler cycling and
fluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on the
dilution and bolometer plates. These fluctuations do not compromise the science
data.

the Planck satellite through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect from its six
highest frequencies. This early SZ (ESZ) sample is comprised of 189 candidates,
which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. Its high
reliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validation
process based on Planck internal quality assessments and by external
cross-identification and follow-up observations. Planck provides the first
measured SZ signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known ESZ clusters.
Planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meet
the ESZ signal-to-noise selection criterion. At the submission date, twelve of
the 20 ESZ candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmed
using XMM-Newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbed
morphologies and low luminosities. The ESZ clusters are mostly at moderate
redshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to the
rarest and most massive clusters with masses above 10^15 Msol.

  cluster candidates","21 pages, 16 figures (some low resolution), final version accepted
  for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201116460",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the XMM-Newton follow-up for confirmation of Planck cluster
candidates. Twenty-five candidates have been observed to date using snapshot
(~10 ksec) exposures, ten as part of a pilot programme to sample a low range of
signal-to-noise ratios (4<S/N<6), and a further 15 in a programme to observe a
sample of S/N>5 candidates. The sensitivity and spatial resolution of
XMM-Newton allows unambiguous discrimination between clusters and false
candidates. The 4 false candidates have S/N <= 4.1. A total of 21 candidates
are confirmed as extended X-ray sources. Seventeen are single clusters, the
majority of which are found to have highly irregular and disturbed morphologies
(about ~70%). The remaining four sources are multiple systems, including the
unexpected discovery of a supercluster at z=0.45. For 20 sources we are able to
derive a redshift estimate from the X-ray Fe K line (albeit of variable
quality). The new clusters span the redshift range 0.09 <= z <= 0.54, with a
median redshift of z~0.37. A first determination is made of their X-ray
properties including the characteristic size, which is used to improve the
estimate of the SZ Compton parameter, Y_SZ. The follow-up validation programme
has helped to optimise the Planck candidate selection process. It has also
provided a preview of the X-ray properties of these newly-discovered clusters,
allowing comparison with their SZ properties, and to the X-ray and SZ
properties of known clusters observed in the Planck survey. Our results suggest
that Planck may have started to reveal a non-negligible population of massive
dynamically perturbed objects that is under-represented in X-ray surveys.
However, despite their particular properties, these new clusters appear to
follow the Y_SZ-Y_X relation established for X-ray selected objects, where Y_X

approximately a decade in total mass, 10^14 < M_500 < 10^15, where M_500 is the
mass corresponding to a total density contrast of 500. Combining these high
quality Planck measurements with deep XMM-Newton X-ray data, we investigate the
relations between D_A^2 Y_500, the integrated Compton parameter due to the SZ
effect, and the X-ray-derived gas mass M_g,500, temperature T_X, luminosity
L_X, SZ signal analogue Y_X,500 = M_g,500 * T_X, and total mass M_500. After
correction for the effect of selection bias on the scaling relations, we find
results that are in excellent agreement with both X-ray predictions and
recently-published ground-based data derived from smaller samples. The present

(Y500-N200) for the MaxBCG cluster catalogue. Employing a multi-frequency
matched filter on the Planck sky maps, we measure the SZ signal for each
cluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibrated
mass-richness relations (N200-M500). We bin our individual measurements and
detect the SZ signal down to the lowest richness systems (N200=10) with high
significance, achieving a detection of the SZ signal in systems with mass as
low as M500~5e13 Msolar. The observed Y500-N200 relation is well modeled by a
power law over the full richness range. It has a lower normalisation at given
N200 than predicted based on X-ray models and published mass-richness
relations. An X-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,
and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measured
bin-average SZ signal and measured bin-average X-ray luminosities. At fixed
richness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the Y500-N200 relation of 60%
rising to of order 100% at low richness. Thanks to its all-sky coverage, Planck
provides observations for more than 13,000 MaxBCG clusters and an unprecedented
SZ/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws to
include SZ-optical properties. The data set offers essential clues for models
of galaxy formation. Moreover, the lower normalisation of the SZ-mass relation
implied by the observed SZ-richness scaling has important consequences for
cluster physics and cosmological studies with SZ clusters.

area of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra of
cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =
2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 GHz. We use 21-cm observations of HI as a tracer
of thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of Galactic dust
emission and use the 143 GHz Planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmic
microwave background anisotropies. Both of these cleaning processes are
necessary to avoid significant contamination of the CIB signal. We measure
correlated CIB structure across frequencies. As expected, the correlation
decreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution of
high-redshift galaxies to CIB anisotropies increases with wavelengths. We find
no significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the CIB
anisotropies and the CIB mean, with Delta I/I=15% from 217 to 857 GHz. In terms
of clustering properties, the Planck data alone rule out the linear scale- and
redshift-independent bias model. Non-linear corrections are significant.
Consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,
parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. It provides an
excellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggests
that a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,
which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated by
contributions from different redshifts. In our best-fit model, half of the
anisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z<0.8 at 857 GHz and z<1.5 at
545 GHz, while about 90% come from redshifts z>2 at 353 and 217 GHz,
respectively.

thermal dust emission using the Planck-HFI and IRAS data. The optical depth
maps are correlated to tracers of the atomic and molecular gas. The correlation
is linear in the lowest column density regions at high galactic latitudes. At
high NH, the correlation is consistent with that of the lowest NH. In the
intermediate NH range, we observe departure from linearity, with the dust
optical depth in excess to the correlation. We attribute this excess emission
to thermal emission by dust associated with a Dark-Gas phase, undetected in the
available HI and CO measurements. We show the 2D spatial distribution of the
Dark-Gas in the solar neighborhood and show that it extends around known
molecular regions traced by CO. The average dust emissivity in the HI phase in
the solar neighborhood follows roughly a power law distribution with beta = 1.8
all the way down to 3 mm, although the SED flattens slightly in the millimetre.
The threshold for the existence of the Dark-Gas is found at NH = (8.0\pm 0.58)
10^{20} Hcm-2. Assuming the same dust emissivity at high frequencies for the
dust in the atomic and molecular phases leads to an average XCO = (2.54\pm0.13)
10^{20} H2cm-2/(K km s-1). The mass of Dark-Gas is found to be 28% of the
atomic gas and 118% of the CO emitting gas in the solar neighborhood. A
possible origin for the Dark-Gas is the existence of a dark molecular phase,
where H2 survives photodissociation but CO does not. The observed transition
for the onset of this phase in the solar neighborhood (AV = 0.4 mag) appears
consistent with recent theoretical predictions. We also discuss the possibility
that up to half of the Dark-Gas could be in atomic form, due to optical depth
effects in the HI measurements.

in the frequency range ~10-60 GHz. Using Planck maps and multi-frequency
ancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known AME regions: the
Perseus and Rho Ophiuchi molecular clouds. The spectra are well fitted by a
combination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,
and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. The spinning
dust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the high
frequency side clearly for the first time. The spectra have a peak in the range
20-40 GHz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for Perseus and
8.4 sigma for Rho Ophiuchi. In Perseus, spinning dust in the dense molecular
gas can account for most of the AME; the low density atomic gas appears to play
a minor role. In Rho Ophiuchi, the ~30 GHz peak is dominated by dense molecular
gas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 GHz,
which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. The dust
parameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. We have
also searched the Planck map at 28.5 GHz for candidate AME regions, by
subtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. We
present spectra for two of the candidates; S140 and S235 are bright HII regions
that show evidence for AME, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

The
observed foreground emission contains contributions from different phases of
the interstellar medium (ISM). We have separated the observed Galactic emission
into the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in each
of a number of Galactocentric rings. Templates are created for various
Galactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)
and molecular (12CO) observations. The ionised template is assumed to be traced
by free-free emission as observed by WMAP, while 408 MHz emission is used to
trace the synchrotron component. Gas emission not traced by the above
templates, namely ""ark gas"", as evidenced using Planck data, is included as an
additional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.
These templates are then correlated with each of the Planck frequency bands, as
well as other ancillary data. The emission per column density of the gas
templates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) per
Galactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 GHz to 25 THz
(12\mu m). Apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probed
the Galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.
We show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular and
dark gas phases throughout the Galactic disk. The derived dust propeties
associated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to reveal
the nature of this phase. For all environments, the anomalous emission is
consistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and,
according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of the
total emission at 30 GHz.

Catalogue of Planck Objects (C3PO), in terms of their spatial distribution,
temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. We also describe the statistics of
the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC, delivered with the Early Release Compact
Source Catalogue, ERCSC) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detections
of the complete catalogue. We have used the CoCoCoDeT algorithm to extract
10783 cold sources. Temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} values
are derived using the fluxes in the IRAS 100 \mum band and the three highest
frequency Planck bands. Temperature spans from 7K to 17K, and peaks around 13K.
Data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the all
temperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,
and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(T) and the
effect of multiple T components folded into the measurements. For one third of
the objects the distances are obtained. Most of the detections are within 2 kpc
in the Solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. The
cores are distributed from the deep Galactic plane, despite the confusion, to
high latitudes (>30$^{\circle}$). The associated mass estimates range from 1 to
$10^5$ solar masses. Using their physical properties these cold sources are
shown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structures
between clouds and cores. These cold clumps are not isolated but mostly
organized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. The Cold Core
Catalogue of Planck Objects (C3PO) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue of
cold objects. It gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties of
these potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for their
classification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.

  issue for Planck early papers",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201116485",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents the first results of comparison of Planck along with IRAS
data with Green Bank Telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering more
than 800 square degrees at high Galactic latitude. Galactic dust emission for
fields with average HI column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is well
correlated with 21-cm emission. The residual emission in these fields, once the
HI-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statistical
properties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. Fields with larger
column densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the HI
column density. Regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest the
presence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlated
with CO emission. Dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detected
with high significance. Its spectral properties are consistent with, compared
to the local ISM values, significantly hotter dust (T~20 K), lower
sub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains to
large grains about four times higher. These results are compatible with
expectations for clouds that are part of the Galactic fountain in which there
is dust shattering and fragmentation. Correlated dust emission in HVCs is not
detected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is
0.15 times the local ISM value at 857 and 3000 GHz, in accordance with gas
phase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. Unexpected
anti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-section
per H atom are identified in the local ISM and IVCs, a trend that continues
into molecular environments. This suggests that dust growth through
aggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloud
condensation and star formation processes.

emission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecular
clouds. We present an early analysis of the Taurus molecular complex, on
line-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. The emission
spectrum measured by Planck and IRAS can be fitted pixel by pixel using a
single modified blackbody. Some systematic residuals are detected at 353 GHz
and 143 GHz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicating
that the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modified
blackbody. Significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecular
regions and in the 217 GHz and 100 GHz bands, mainly caused by to the
contribution of the J=2-1 and J=1-0 12CO and 13CO emission lines. We derive
maps of the dust temperature T, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, and
the dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. The temperature map illustrates the
cooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incident
radiation field, from 16-17 K in the diffuse regions to 13-14 K in the dense
parts. The distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standard
deviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. We detect a significant
T-beta anti-correlation. The dust optical depth map reveals the spatial
distribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densest
molecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. We use near-infrared extinction
and HI data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatial
variations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atom
tau/NH. We report an increase of tau/NH by a factor of about 2 between the
atomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on the
equilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

temperature and polarization anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background
and galactic foregrounds in six wide bands centered at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545
and 857 GHz at an angular resolution of 10' (100 GHz), 7' (143 GHz), and 5'
(217 GHz and higher). HFI has been operating flawlessly since launch on 14 May
2009. The bolometers cooled to 100 mK as planned. The settings of the readout
electronics, such as the bolometer bias current, that optimize HFI's noise
performance on orbit are nearly the same as the ones chosen during ground
testing. Observations of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn verified both the optical
system and the time response of the detection chains. The optical beams are
close to predictions from physical optics modeling. The time response of the
detection chains is close to pre-launch measurements. The detectors suffer from
an unexpected high flux of cosmic rays related to low solar activity. Due to
the redundancy of Planck's observations strategy, the removal of a few percent
of data contaminated by glitches does not affect significantly the sensitivity.
The cosmic rays heat up significantly the bolometer plate and the modulation on
periods of days to months of the heat load creates a common drift of all
bolometer signals which do not affect the scientific capabilities. Only the
high energy cosmic rays showers induce inhomogeneous heating which is a
probable source of low frequency noise.

(ERCSC). In particular, we discuss the steps involved in reducing the data from
telemetry packets to cleaned, calibrated, time-ordered data (TOD) and frequency
maps. Data are continuously calibrated using the modulation of the temperature
of the cosmic microwave background radiation induced by the motion of the
spacecraft. Noise properties are estimated from TOD from which the sky signal
has been removed using a generalized least square map-making algorithm.
Measured 1/f noise knee-frequencies range from 100mHz at 30GHz to a few tens of
mHz at 70GHz. A destriping code (Madam) is employed to combine radiometric data
and pointing information into sky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated
noise. Noise covariance matrices required to compute statistical uncertainties
on LFI and Planck products are also produced. Main beams are estimated down to
the approx -10dB level using Jupiter transits, which are also used for
geometrical calibration of the focal plane.

and usage of the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC),
including the Early Cold Cores (ECC) and the Early Sunyaev-Zeldovich (ESZ)
cluster catalogue is provided. The catalogue is based on data that consist of
mapping the entire sky once and 60% of the sky a second time by Planck, thereby
comprising the first high sensitivity radio/submillimetre observations of the
entire sky. A Monte-Carlo algorithm based on the injection and extraction of
artificial sources into the Planck maps was implemented to select reliable
sources among all extracted candidates such that the cumulative reliability of
the catalogue is >=90%. The 10sigma photometric flux density limit of the
catalogue at |b|>30 deg is 0.49, 1.0, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33, 0.28, 0.25, 0.47 and
0.82 Jy at each of the nine frequencies between 30 and 857 GHz. Sources which
are up to a factor of ~2 fainter than this limit, and which are present in
""clean"" regions of the Galaxy where the sky background due to emission from the
interstellar medium is low, are included in the ERCSC if they meet the high
reliability criterion. The Planck ERCSC sources have known associations to
stars with dust shells, stellar cores, radio galaxies, blazars, infrared
luminous galaxies and Galactic interstellar medium features. A significant
fraction of unclassified sources are also present in the catalogs. In addition,
two early release catalogs that contain 915 cold molecular cloud core
candidates and 189 SZ cluster candidates that have been generated using
multi-frequency algorithms are presented. The entire source list, with more
than 15000 unique sources, is ripe for follow-up characterisation with
Herschel, ATCA, VLA, SOFIA, ALMA and other ground-based observing facilities.

  scaling relations for X-ray galaxy clusters","Final version accepted for publication in A&A. Also available from

Clusters of galaxies (MCXC) are combined to investigate the relationship
between the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal and X-ray luminosity. The
sample comprises ~ 1600 X-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans a
wide range in X-ray luminosity. The SZ signal is extracted for each object
individually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximised
by averaging the SZ signal in bins of X-ray luminosity, total mass, or
redshift. The SZ signal is detected at very high significance over more than
two decades in X-ray luminosity (10^43 erg/s < L_500 E(z)^-7/3 < 2 X 10^45
erg/s). The relation between intrinsic SZ signal and X-ray luminosity is
investigated and the measured SZ signal is compared to values predicted from
X-ray data. Planck measurements and X-ray based predictions are found to be in
excellent agreement over the whole explored luminosity range. No significant
deviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. For the
first time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between SZ signal and
X-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in the
luminosity -- mass relation from X-ray studies. There is no evidence of any
deficit in SZ signal strength in Planck data relative to expectations from the
X-ray properties of clusters, underlining the robustness and consistency of our
overall view of intra-cluster medium properties.

are exploited to measure the number counts (dN/dS) of extragalactic radio
sources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 GHz. Due to the full-sky nature of the
catalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in the
sky. At lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 GHz) our counts are in very good
agreement with estimates based on WMAP data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70
GHz, and somewhat shallower at 44 GHz. Planck's source counts at 143 and 217
GHz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the SPT and ACT surveys
over small fractions of the sky. An analysis of source spectra, exploiting
Planck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepening
of the mean spectral index above about 70 GHz. This implies that, at these
frequencies, the contamination of the CMB power spectrum by radio sources below
the detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

(ERCSC) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)
wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxies
detected, as well as the range of far-IR/submm wavelengths over which they have
been observed. We here present the first results on the properties of nearby
galaxies using these data. We match the ERCSC catalogue to IRAS-detected
galaxies in the Imperial IRAS Faint Source Redshift Catalogue (IIFSCz), so that
we can measure the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these objects from
60 to 850 microns. This produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliable
associations between Planck and IRAS, from which we select a subset of 468 for
SED studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequency
Planck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. The SEDs are fitted using
parametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures and
emissivities. We find evidence for colder dust than has previously been found
in external galaxies, with T<20K. Such cold temperatures are found using both
the standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or a
two dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. We also compare our results to
studies of distant submm galaxies (SMGs) which have been claimed to contain
cooler dust than their local counterparts. We find that including our sample of
468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.
Fits to SEDs of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derived
from radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust found
through parameteric fitting. We thus conclude that cold (T<20K) dust is a
significant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

Magellanic Cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust models
based on their FIR and radio emission. The origin of this millimetre excess is
still unexplained, and is here investigated using the Planck data. The
background CMB contribution is subtracted using an ILC method performed locally
around the galaxies. The foreground emission from the Milky Way is subtracted.
After subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with the
gas emission of the LMC and SMC. The millimetre excess in the LMC can be
explained by CMB fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in the
SMC SED. The Planck and IRIS data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermal
dust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. The LMC
temperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with the
Spitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified cold
outer arm. Several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which are
associated with known molecular clouds. The average emissivity spectral index
is found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for the
LMC and SMC respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in the
Milky Way. Furthermore, there is evidence in the SMC for a further flattening
of the SED in the sub-mm. The spatial distribution of the millimetre dust
excess in the SMC follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. Different
models are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the SMC. It is
concluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dust
emission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emission
and thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present in
our Galaxy.

presented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based on
the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue (ERCSC) and simultaneous
multifrequency data. The nine Planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 GHz, are
complemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio to
gamma-rays. This is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio and
millimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radio
sources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase of
development, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. The
SEDs presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degree
polynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse Compton
(IC) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,
including the Planck ERCSC data, were calculated. SED modelling methods are
discussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotron
bump using multiplecomponents. Planck ERCSC data also suggest that the original
accelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonly
thought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. The
implications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective in
blazar shock. Furthermore in many cases the Planck data indicate that gamma-ray
emission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

extrinsic features depending on the way the handlebody H is knotted in S^3.
Starting from a first level of knotting that requires the non-existence of a
planar spine for H, we define several instances of knotting of H in terms of
the non-existence of spines with special properties. Some of these instances
are implied by an intrinsic counterpart in terms of the non-existence of
special cut-systems for M. We study a natural partial order on these instances
of knotting, as well as its intrinsic counterpart, and the relations between
them. To this aim, we recognize a few effective ""obstructions"" based on recent
quandle-coloring invariants for spatial handlebodies, on the extension to the
context of spatial handlebodies of tools coming from the theory of homology
boundary links, on the analysis of appropriate coverings of M, and on the very
classical use of Alexander elementary ideals of the fundamental group of M. Our
treatment of the matter also allows us to revisit a few old-fashioned beautiful

habitability. However, as more Earth-like planets are discovered around
low-mass stars (LMSs), a re-examination of the role of tides on the
habitability of exoplanets has begun. Those studies have yet to consider the
misalignment between a planet's rotational axis and the orbital plane normal,
i.e. the planetary obliquity. We apply two equilibrium tide theories to compute
the obliquity evolution of terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zones
around LMSs. The time for the obliquity to decrease from an Earth-like
obliquity of 23.5 deg to 5 deg, the 'tilt erosion time', is compared to the
traditional insolation habitable zone (IHZ) as a function of semi-major axis,
eccentricity, and stellar mass. We also compute tidal heating and equilibrium
rotation caused by obliquity tides. The Super-Earth Gl581d and the planet
candidate Gl581g are studied as examples for tidal processes. Earth-like
obliquities of terrestrial planets in the IHZ around <0.25 solar mass (M_sun)
stars are eroded in <0.1 Gyr. Only terrestrial planets orbiting stars with
masses >0.9 M_sun experience tilt erosion times larger than 1 Gyr throughout
the IHZ. Terrestrial planets in the IHZ of stars with masses <0.25 M_sun
undergo significant tidal heating due to obliquity tides. The predictions of
the two tidal models diverge significantly for e>0.3. In our two-body
simulations, Gl581d's obliquity is eroded to 0 and its rotation period reached
its equilibrium state of half its orbital period in <0.1 Gyr. Tidal surface
heating on the putative Gl581g is <150 mW/m^2 as long as its eccentricity is
<0.3. Obliquity tides modify the concept of the habitable zone. Tilt erosion of
terrestrial planets orbiting LMSs should be included by atmospheric modelers.
Tidal heating needs to be considered by geologists.

will be required to play an increasingly important role in compensating the
fast time-scale fluctuations in generated power. Recent numerical modeling of
thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) has demonstrated that such load
following is feasible, but analytical models that satisfactorily quantify the
aggregate power consumption of a group of TCLs are desired to enable controller
design. We develop such a model for the aggregate power response of a
homogeneous population of TCLs to uniform variation of all TCL setpoints. A
linearized model of the response is derived, and a linear quadratic regulator
(LQR) has been designed. Using the TCL setpoint as the control input, the LQR
enables aggregate power to track reference signals that exhibit step, ramp and
sinusoidal variations. Although much of the work assumes a homogeneous
population of TCLs with deterministic dynamics, we also propose a method for
probing the dynamics of systems where load characteristics are not well known.

galaxies to study the influence of bars in the building of galaxy bulges. Line
strength indices were measured and used to derive age and metallicity gradients
in the bulge region by comparing with stellar population models. The same
analysis was also carried out with similar data of unbarred galaxies taken from
the literature. The bulges of barred galaxies seem to be more metal rich, at a
given velocity dispersion (sigma), than the bulges of unbarred galaxies, as
measured by some metallicity sensitive indices. There are indications that the
ratio of relative abundance of alpha-elements with respect to iron, [E/Fe],
derived for the bulges of barred galaxies tend to lie above the values of the
unbarred galaxies at a given sigma. The metallicity gradients for the majority
of the bulges are negative, less metal rich towards the end of the bulge. The
gradient values show a large scatter for galaxies with sigma below 150 km/s.
The age distribution is related to the presence of bulge substructure such as a
nuclear ring or an inner disk. The metallicity of both the bulge and the bar
are very well correlated indicating a close link between the enrichment
histories of both components. Bulges of barred early type galaxies might have
suffered a different chemical enrichment compared to the bulges of unbarred
galaxies of the same morphological type, same central velocity dispersion and
low inclination angles. The hinted stellar populations differences separating
the bulges of barred and unbarred galaxies and the strong link existing between
the metallicity of the bulge and the presence of a bar points to scenarios were
they both form simultaneously in processes leading to rapid and massive
episodes of star formation, possibly linked to the bar formation.

is discussed that is based on the factorized DD (double distribution) Ansatz
within the single-DD formalism. The latter was not used before, because
reconstructing GPDs from the forward limit one should start in this case with a
very singular function f({\beta})/{\beta} rather than with the usual parton
density f({\beta}). This results in a non-integrable singularity at {\beta}=0
exaggerated by the fact that f({\beta})'s, on their own, have a singular
{\beta}^{-a} Regge behavior for small {\beta}. It is shown that the singularity
is regulated within the GPD model of Szczepaniak et al., in which the Regge
behavior is implanted through a subtracted dispersion relation for the
hadron-parton scattering amplitude. It is demonstrated that using proper
softening of the quark-hadron vertices in the regions of large parton
virtualities results in model GPDs H(x,{\xi}) that are finite and continuous at
the ""border point"" x={\xi}. Using a simple input forward distribution, we
illustrate implementation of the new approach for explicit construction of

{\beta}=0 singularities is proposed that is based on the separation of the
initial single DD f({\beta}, {\alpha}) into the ""plus"" part
[f({\beta},{\alpha})]_{+} and the D-term. It is demonstrated that the ""DD+D""

In the course of our derivation, we define inner products, norms, and other

implications are dramatically different from the standard matrix case. For
example, a matrix of circulants has a polynomial number of eigenvalues in its

apply the spectral action principle in this almost commutative space. Following
this procedure one obtains an elegant geometric explanation for the most
successful particle physics model, namely the standard model (and
supersymmetric extensions) of electroweak and strong interactions in all its

analyze a stochastic model of bursty gene expression which considers general

the system to models analyzed in queueing theory, we derive analytical
expressions for the noise in steady-state protein distributions. The derived

an additional constraint from thermodynamics that is not used in deriving the

in the context of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology implies
very different things than for a static universe. It is argued that it is
reasonable to assume that this cutoff is implemented by fixing the number of
quantum degrees of freedom per co-moving volume (as opposed to a Planck volume)
and the relationship of the vacuum-energy of all of the fields in the theory to
the cosmological constant (or dark energy) is re-examined. The restrictions
that need to be satisfied by a generic theory to avoid conflicts with current
experiments are discussed, and it is shown that in any theory satisfying these
constraints knowing the difference between $w$ and minus one allows one to
predict $\dot{w}$. It is argued that this is a robust result and if this
prediction fails the idea of a fundamental cutoff of the type being discussed
can be ruled out. Finally, it is observed that, within the context of a
specific theory, a co-moving cutoff implies a predictable time variation of
fundamental constants. This is accompanied by a general discussion of why this
is so, what are the strongest phenomenological limits upon this predicted
variation, and which limits are in tension with the idea of a co-moving cutoff.
It is pointed out, however, that a careful comparison of the predicted time
variation of fundamental constants is not possible without restricting to a
particular model field-theory and that is not done in this paper.

$\tau$ and fits straight lines with slopes $m$ and y-intercepts $c$ given by
$m=0.40\pm0.03$, $c=-1.86\pm0.27$ and $m=0.01\pm0.001$, $c=-0.85\pm0.02$,

been advanced as a candidate alternative to standard Einstein gravity. As a
quantum theory the conformal theory is both renormalizable and unitary, with
unitarity being obtained because the theory is a $PT$ symmetric rather than a
Hermitian theory. We show that in the theory there can be no a priori classical
curvature, with all curvature having to result from quantization. In the
conformal theory gravity requires no independent quantization of its own, with
it being quantized solely by virtue of its being coupled to a quantized matter
source. Moreover, because it is this very coupling that fixes the strength of
the gravitational field commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy
density and pressure fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the
zero-point fluctuations associated with the matter sector. In addition, we show
that when the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the zero-point
structure automatically readjusts so as to identically cancel the cosmological
constant term that dynamical mass generation induces. We show that the
macroscopic classical theory that results from the quantum conformal theory
incorporates global physics effects that provide for a detailed accounting of a
comprehensive set of 138 galactic rotation curves with no adjustable parameters
other than the galactic mass to light ratios, and with the need for no dark
matter whatsoever. With these global effects eliminating the need for dark
matter, we see that invoking dark matter in galaxies could potentially be
nothing more than an attempt to describe global physics effects in purely local
galactic terms. Finally, we review some recent work by 't Hooft in which a
connection between conformal gravity and Einstein gravity has been found.

understood since the pioneering work of Goeppert-Mayer, Haxel, Jensen and
Suess.They realized that the experimental evidence for nuclear magic numbers
could be explained by introducing a strong spin-orbit interaction in the
nuclear shell model potential. However, our detailed knowledge of nuclear
forces and the mechanisms governing the structure of nuclei, in particular far
from stability, is still incomplete. In nuclei with equal neutron and proton
numbers ($N = Z$), the unique nature of the atomic nucleus as an object
composed of two distinct types of fermions can be expressed as enhanced
correlations arising between neutrons and protons occupying orbitals with the
same quantum numbers. Such correlations have been predicted to favor a new type
of nuclear superfluidity; isoscalar neutron-proton pairing, in addition to
normal isovector pairing (see Fig. 1). Despite many experimental efforts these
predictions have not been confirmed. Here, we report on the first observation
of excited states in $N = Z = 46$ nucleus $^{92}$Pd. Gamma rays emitted
following the $^{58}$Ni($^{36}$Ar,2$n$)$^{92}$Pd fusion-evaporation reaction
were identified using a combination of state-of-the-art high-resolution
{\gamma}-ray, charged-particle and neutron detector systems. Our results reveal
evidence for a spin-aligned, isoscalar neutron-proton coupling scheme,
different from the previous prediction. We suggest that this coupling scheme
replaces normal superfluidity (characterized by seniority coupling) in the
ground and low-lying excited states of the heaviest N = Z nuclei. The strong
isoscalar neutron- proton correlations in these $N = Z$ nuclei are predicted to
have a considerable impact on their level structures, and to influence the
dynamics of the stellar rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis process.

the two transmitters can exploit one common relay node to improve their
individual transmission rate. Communications are assumed to be multi-band and
transmitters are assumed to selfishly allocate their resources to optimize
their individual transmission rate. The main objective of this paper is to show
that this conflicting situation (modeled by a non-cooperative game) has some
stable outcomes, namely Nash equilibria. This result is proved for three
different types of relaying protocols: decode-and-forward,
estimate-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward. We provide additional results on
the problems of uniqueness, efficiency of the equilibrium, and convergence of a
best-response based dynamics to the equilibrium. These issues are analyzed in a
special case of the amplify-and-forward protocol and illustrated by simulations
in general.

out of F-theory, and the dynamics of No-Scale Supergravity, which in turn imply
a very restricted set of high energy boundary conditions. By secondarily

consequently also the total magnitude of the GUT-scale Higgs VEVs, while

measure problem. One should expect to be a typical observer, but defining such
a thing is difficult in the vastness of an eternally inflating universe. We
propose that a crucial prerequisite is understanding why one should exist as an
observer at all. We assume that the Physical Church Turing Thesis is correct
and therefore all observers (and everything else that exists) can be described
as different types of information. We then argue that the observers
collectively form the largest class of information (where, in analogy with the
Faddeev Popov procedure, we only count over ""gauge invariant"" forms of
information). The statistical predominance of the observers is due to their
ability to selectively absorb other forms of information from many different
sources. In particular, it is the combinatorics that arise from this selection
process which leads us to equate the observer class $\mathcal{O}$ with the
nontrivial power set $\hat{\mathcal{P}}(\mathcal{U})$ of the set of all
information $\mathcal{U}$. Observers themselves are thus the typical form of
information. If correct, this proposal simplifies the measure problem, and
leads to dramatic long term predictions.

simulation. Near tau=1, the simulation produces penumbral fine structure
consistent with the observationally inferred interlocking comb structure. Fast
outflows exceeding 8 km/s are present along almost horizontal stretches of the
magnetic field; in the outer half of the penumbra, we see opposite polarity
flux indicating flux returning beneath the surface. The bulk of the penumbral
brightness is maintained by small-scale motions turning over on scales shorter
than the length of a typical penumbral filament. The resulting vertical rms
velocity at tau=1 is about half of that found in the quiet Sun. Radial outflows
in the sunspot penumbra have two components. In the uppermost few 100 km, fast
outflows are driven primarily through the horizontal component of the Lorentz
force, which is confined to narrow boundary layers beneath tau=1, while the
contribution from horizontal pressure gradients is reduced in comparison to
granulation as a consequence of anisotropy. The resulting Evershed flow reaches
its peak velocity near tau=1 and falls off rapidly with height. Outflows
present in deeper layers result primarily from a preferred ring-like alignment
of convection cells surrounding the sunspot. These flows reach amplitudes of
about 50% of the convective rms velocity rather independent of depth. A
preference for the outflow results from a combination of Lorentz force and
pressure driving. While the Evershed flow dominates by velocity amplitude, most
of the mass flux is present in deeper layers and likely related to a
large-scale moat flow.

variability of the stars, is based on VLT/UVES spectra (R~ 43000) and 1D LTE
OSMARCS model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. For comparison with SN models
we also estimate NLTE corrections for a number of elements. We derive LTE
abundances for the 16 elements O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe,
Co, Ni, Sr and Ba, in good agreement with earlier values for EMP dwarf, giant

corrections are newly calculated for O and Mg and taken from the literature for
other elements. The resulting abundance pattern is best matched by model yields
for supernova explosions with high energy and/or significant asphericity
effects. Our results indicate that, except for Li and C, the surface
composition of EMP RR Lyr stars is not significantly affected by mass loss,
mixing or diffusion processes; hence, EMP RR Lyr stars should also be useful
tracers of the chemical evolution of the early Galactic halo. The observed

variation in their light element abundances. These variations have been
interpreted as evidence for multiple star formation episodes within GCs, with
secondary episodes fueled, at least in part, by the ejecta of AGB stars from a
first generation of stars. A major puzzle emerging from this otherwise
plausible scenario is that the fraction of stars associated with the second
episode of star formation is observed to be much larger than expected for a
standard IMF. The present work investigates this tension by modeling the
observed anti-correlation between [Na/Fe] and [O/Fe] for 20 Galactic GCs. If
the abundance pattern of the retained AGB ejecta does not depend on GC mass at
fixed [Fe/H], then a strong correlation is found between the fraction of
current GC stellar mass comprised of pure AGB ejecta, f_p, and GC mass. This
fraction varies from 0.20 at low masses (10^4.5 Msun) to 0.45 at high masses
(10^6.5 Msun). The fraction of mass associated with pure AGB ejecta is directly
related to the total mass of the cluster at birth; the ratio between the
initial and present mass in stars can therefore be derived. Assuming a star
formation efficiency of 50%, the observed Na-O anti-correlations imply that GCs
were at least 10-20 times more massive at birth. These factors are lower limits
because any mass-loss mechanism that removes first and second generation stars
equally will leave f_p unchanged. The mass-dependence of f_p probably arises
because lower mass GCs are unable to retain all of the AGB ejecta from the
first stellar generation. Recent observations of elemental abundances in
intermediate-age LMC clusters are re-interpreted and shown to be consistent
with this basic scenario. A convincing explanation of these trends is currently
lacking.

range Coulomb interaction and chemical potential disorder exhibit striking
fermionic quantum criticality. For an odd number of flavors of Dirac fermions,
the sign of the Dirac mass distinguishes the topological and the trivial band
insulator phases, and the gapless semi-metallic phase corresponds to the
quantum critical point that separates the two. Up to a critical strength of
disorder, the semi-metallic phase remains stable, and the universality class of
the direct phase transition between two insulating phases is unchanged. Beyond
the critical strength of disorder the semi-metallic phase undergoes a phase
transition into a disorder controlled diffusive metallic phase, and there is no
longer a direct phase transition between the two types of insulating phases.
Our results are also applicable to even number of flavors of Dirac fermions,

ionisation equilibrium of calcium under solar chromospheric conditions. The
study is based on numerical simulations with the RADYN code, which includes
hydrodynamics, radiative transfer, and a detailed non-equilibrium treatment of
hydrogen, calcium, and helium. The simulations are characterised by upwards
propagating shock waves, which cause strong temperature fluctuations and
variations of the ionisation degree of calcium. The passage of a hot shock
front leads to a strong net ionisation of Ca II, rapidly followed by net
recombination. The relaxation timescale of the Ca ionisation state is found to
be of the order of a few seconds at the top of the photosphere and 10 to 30 s
in the upper chromosphere. Generally, the timescales are significantly reduced
in the wakes of hot shock fronts. The timescales can be reliably determined
from a simple analysis of the eigenvalues of the transition rate matrix. The
timescales are dominated by the radiative recombination from Ca III into the
metastable Ca II energy levels of the 4d 2D term. These transitions depend
strongly on the density of free electrons and therefore on the
(non-equilibrium) ionisation degree of hydrogen, which is the main electron
donor. The ionisation/recombination timescales derived here are too long for
the assumption of an instantaneous ionisation equilibrium to be valid and, on
the other hand, are not long enough to warrant an assumption of a constant
ionisation fraction. Fortunately, the ionisation degree of Ca II remains small
in the height range, where the cores of the H, K, and the infrared triplet
lines are formed. We conclude that the difference due to a detailed treatment
of Ca ionisation has only negligible impact on the modelling of spectral lines
of Ca II and the plasma properties under the conditions in the quiet solar
chromosphere.

relationship that can be highly intermittent. We argue that the phenomenon
closely resembles the notion of meaningful synchronicity put forward by Jung
and Pauli if one identifies ""meaningfulness"" with internal synchronization,
since the latter seems necessary for synchronizability with an external system.
Jungian synchronization of mind and matter is realized if mind is analogized to
a computer model, synchronizing with a sporadically observed system as in
meteorological data assimilation. Internal synchronization provides a recipe
for combining different models of the same objective process, a configuration
that may also describe the functioning of conscious brains. In contrast to
Pauli's view, recent developments suggest a materialist picture of
semi-autonomous mind, existing alongside the observed world, with both
exhibiting a synchronistic order. Basic physical synchronicity is manifest in
the non-local quantum connections implied by Bell's theorem. The quantum world
resides on a generalized synchronization ""manifold"", a view that provides a
bridge between nonlocal realist interpretations and local realist
interpretations that constrain observer choice .

of indistinguishable drivers commuting between a common origin/destination pair

by their, relatively infrequent, perturbed best responses to global information
about the current network congestion levels, as well as their instantaneous
local observation of the immediate surroundings as they transit through the
network. A novel model is proposed for the drivers' route choice behavior,
exhibiting local consistency with their preference toward globally less
congested paths as well as myopic decisions in favor of locally less congested
paths. The simultaneous evolution of the traffic congestion on the network and
of the aggregate path preference is modeled by a system of coupled ordinary
differential equations. The main result shows that, if the frequency of updates
of path preferences is sufficiently small as compared to the frequency of the
traffic flow dynamics, then the state of the transportation network ultimately
approaches a neighborhood of the Wardrop equilibrium. The presented results may
be read as a further evidence in support of Wardrop's postulate of equilibrium,

large eukaryotic cells to stir the cell's constituents. In Drosophila oocytes,
microtubules have been observed to undergo undulating motion, curving to form
travelling waves during cytoplasmic streaming. Here we show that this wave-like
motion can be understood physically as due to the hydrodynamic drag of
streaming impellers attached to kinesin motors moving toward the plus-ends of
microtubules whose minus ends are anchored to the cell cortex. The tangential
forces applied to such microtubules by kinesin give rise to bending and leads
to chiral symmetry breaking causing the microtubules to propagate long
travelling waves. The waves are reminiscent of those seen in flagellar motion
but of a much longer time scale and by a different physical mechanism. We show
how kinesin movement can produce a bulk flow of cytoplasm surrounding a
microtubule with the range of flow greatly enhanced by the effect of
hydrodynamic coupling between impellers. That is, a relatively small number of
motors can move a large amount of fluid. The chaotic nature of the fluid motion
of cytoplasm caused by kinesin movement along constantly changing microtubule
trajectories is important as it greatly enhances the efficiency of mixing.
Existing data on in vitro microtubule gliding assays also show this chiral
instability in two dimensions and an analysis of this gives quantitative
estimates for the forces exerted by motors and the drag coefficient.

networks (networks induced by spatial contacts between amino acid residues of a
protein) do not have shorter average shortest path lengths in spite of their
importance to protein folding. We find that shorter average inter-nodal
distances is no guarantee of finding a global optimum more easily. Results from
the experiments also led to observations which parallel an existing view that
neither short-range nor long-range interactions dominate the protein folding
process. Nonetheless, runs where there was a slight delay in the use of
long-range interactions yielded the best search performance. We incorporate
this finding into the optimization function by giving more weight to
short-range links. This produced results showing that randomizing long-range
links does not yield better search performance than protein contact networks au
natural even though randomizing long-range links significantly reduces average
path lengths and retains much of the clustering and positive degree-degree
correlation inherent in protein contact networks. Hence there can be
explanations, other than the excluded volume argument, beneath the topological
limits of protein contact networks.

that only the low-mass end of the population of luminous subhalos of the

supernovae feedback reduces the stellar mass of the low-mass subhalos

If a luminous halo is able to avoid accretion by the Milky-Way progenitor

detected by the Planck satellite at the 5-sigma level and is potentially a
non-negligible source of bias for f_NL estimators of local non-Gaussianity. We
extend current understanding of the lensing bispectrum in several directions:
(1) we perform a non-perturbative calculation of the lensing bispectrum which
is ~10% more accurate than previous, first-order calculations; (2) we
demonstrate how to incorporate the signal variance of the lensing bispectrum
into estimates of its amplitude, providing a good analytical explanation for
previous Monte-Carlo results; and (3) we discover the existence of a
significant lensing bispectrum in polarization, due to a previously-unnoticed
correlation between the lensing potential and E-polarization as large as 30% at
low multipoles. We use this improved understanding of the lensing bispectra to
re-evaluate Fisher-matrix predictions, both for Planck and cosmic variance
limited data. We confirm that the non-negligible lensing-induced bias for
estimation of local non-Gaussianity should be robustly treatable, and will only
inflate f_NL error bars by a few percent over predictions where lensing effects
are completely ignored (but note that lensing must still be accounted for to
obtain unbiased constraints). We also show that the detection significance for
the lensing bispectrum itself is ultimately limited to 9 sigma by cosmic
variance. The tools that we develop for non-perturbative calculation of the
lensing bispectrum are directly relevant to other calculations, and we give an
explicit construction of a simple non-perturbative quadratic estimator for the
lensing potential and relate its cross-correlation power spectrum to the
bispectrum. Our numerical codes are publicly available as part of CAMB and
LensPix.

(DNS) of decaying turbulence in a two-dimensional no-slip wall-bounded domain.
In this bounded domain, the inverse energy cascade, and a net torque exerted by
the boundary, result in a spontaneous spin up of the fluid, leading to a
typical end state of a large monopole vortex that fills the domain. The SPH
simulations were compared against published results using a high accuracy
pseudo-spectral code. Ensemble averages of the kinetic energy, enstrophy and
average vortex wavenumber compared well against the pseudo-spectral results, as
did the evolution of the total angular momentum of the fluid. However, while
the pseudo-spectral results emphasised the importance of the no-slip boundaries
as generators of long lived coherent vortices in the flow, no such generation
was seen in the SPH results. Vorticity filaments produced at the boundary were
always dissipated by the flow shortly after separating from the boundary layer.
The kinetic energy spectrum of the SPH results was calculated using a SPH
Fourier transform that operates directly on the disordered particles. The
ensemble kinetic energy spectrum showed the expected k-3 scaling over most of
the inertial range. However, the spectrum flattened at smaller length scales
(initially less than 7.5 particle spacings and growing in size over time),
indicating an excess of small-scale kinetic energy.

$A_i$ is the coalescence time between individuals i and i+1. There is a Markov
process of point measures $(B_i; i\ge 1)$ keeping track of more ancestral

process of point measures is also closely related to an inhomogeneous spine
decomposition of the lineage of the first surviving particle in generation h in
a planar BGW tree conditioned to survive h generations. The decomposition
involves a point measure $\rho$ storing the number of subtrees on the

convergence of this point measure to a point measure on $\mathbb{R}_+$

QED, and continued in that role for the Standard Model. The muon anomalous

three standard deviations. The electric dipole moment (EDM) violates parity
({$P$}) and time-reversal ({$T$}) symmetries, and in the context of the $CPT$

has a single eigenvalue $b$ different from unity. As $b$ increases through
$b=2$, a gap forms from the largest eigenvalue to the rest of the spectrum, and
with $b-2$ of order $N^{-1/3}$ the scaled largest eigenvalues form a well
defined parameter dependent state. Recent works by Bloemendal and Vir\'ag [BV],
and Mo, have quantified this parameter dependent state for real Wishart
matrices from different viewpoints, and the former authors have done similarly
for the spiked Wishart $\beta$-ensemble. The latter is defined in terms of
certain random bidiagonal matrices. We use a recursive structure to give an
alternative construction of the spiked and more generally the general variance
Wishart $\beta$-ensemble, and we give the exact form of the joint eigenvalue
PDF for the two matrices in the recurrence. In the case of real quaternion
Wishart matrices ($\beta = 4$) the latter is recognised as having appeared in
earlier studies on symmetrized last passage percolation, allowing the exact
form of the scaled distribution of the largest eigenvalue to be given. This
extends and simplifies earlier work of Wang, and is an alternative derivation

might land on well-known extragalactic diagnostic plots over the galaxies'
lifetime (assuming that nothing other than their stellar populations change).
For example, we find that the evolution of these galaxies implies a complex
evolution in the Tully-Fisher relation with lookback time and that the observed
scatter is consistent with excursions these galaxies take as their stellar
populations evolve. We find that the growth of stellar mass is weighted to
early times, despite the strongly star-forming current nature of the three
systems. Lastly, we find that these galaxies can take circuitous paths across
the color-magnitude diagram. For example, it is possible, within the
constraints provided by the current determination of its SFH, that the LMC
reached the red sequence at intermediate age prior to ending back up on the
blue cloud at the current time. Unfortunately, this behavior happens at
sufficiently early times that our resolved SFH is crude and insufficiently
constraining to convincingly demonstrate that this was the actual evolutionary
path. The limited sample size precludes any general conclusions, but we present
these as examples how we can bridge the study of resolved populations and the

multiple massive black holes (hereafter, MBHs) in a primordial galaxy that is

scheme, where not only three-body interaction of MBHs but also dynamical
friction by stars are incorporated. Initially, ten MBHs with equal mass of
$10^7M_\odot$ are set in a host galaxy with $10^{11}M_\odot$. It is found that
4 - 6 MBHs merge successively within 1 Gyr, emitting gravitational wave
radiation. The key process for the successive merger of MBHs is the dynamical
friction by field stars, which enhances three-body interactions of MBHs when
they enter the central regions of the galaxy. The heaviest MBH always composes
a close binary at the galactic center, which shrinks owing to the angular
momentum transfer by the third MBH and eventually merges. The angular momentum
transfer by the third MBH is due to the sling-shot mechanism. We find that the
secular Kozai mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if we include the
relativistic pericenter shift. The simulations show that a multiple MBH system
can produce a heavier MBH at the galactic center purely through $N$-body
process. This merger path can be of great significance for the growth of MBHs
in a primordial galaxy. The merger of multiple MBHs may be a potential source
of gravitational waves for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and
pulsar timing.

responsible for the change in mean flow occuring during pipe flow transition.
Using a single forced momentum balance equation, we show that the shape of the
velocity profile is robust to changes in the forcing profile and that both
linear non-normal and nonlinear effects are required to capture the change in
mean flow associated with transition to turbulence. The particularly simple
form of the model allows for the study of the momentum transfer directly by
inspection of the equations. The distribution of the high- and low-speed
streaks over the cross-section of the pipe produced by our model is remarkably
similar to one observed in the velocity field near the trailing edge of the
puff structures present in pipe flow transition. Under stochastic forcing, the
model exhibits a quasi-periodic self-sustaining cycle characterized by the
creation and subsequent decay of ""streamwise-constant puffs"", so-called due to
the good agreement between the temporal evolution of their velocity field and
the projection of the velocity field associated with three-dimensional puffs in
a frame of reference moving at the bulk velocity. We establish that the flow
dynamics are relatively insensitive to the regeneration mechanisms invoked to
produce near-wall streamwise vortices and that using small, unstructured
background disturbances to regenerate the streamwise vortices is sufficient to
capture the formation of the high- and low-speed streaks and their segregation
leading to the blunting of the velocity profile characteristic of turbulent
pipe flow.

relatively large distance from the robot, of the order of tens of times the
size of the robot itself. To this purpose, we adopt casting manipulation and
visual-based feedback control. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a
robotic end-effector far from the robot's base, by throwing the end-effector
and controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light
tether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can then be used
to retrieve the end- effector to exert forces on the robot's environment. In
previous work, planar casting manipulation was demon- strated to aptly catch
static objects placed at a distant, known position, thus proving it suitable
for applications such as sample acquisition and return, rescue, etc. In this
paper we propose an extension of the idea to controlling the position of the
end- effector to reach moving targets in 3D. The goal is achieved by an
innovative design of the casting mechanism, and by closing a real-time control
loop on casting manipulation using visual feedback of moving targets. To
achieve this result, simplified yet accurate models of the system suitable for
real-time computation are developed, along with a suitable visual feedback
scheme for the flight phase. Effectiveness of the visual feedback controller is
demonstrated through experiments with a 2D casting robot.

of autonomous robots, which coexist in a shared environment and interact with
each other according to a set of ""social behaviors"", or common rules. Such
rules specify what actions each robot is allowed to perform in the pursuit of
its individual goals: rules are distributed, i.e. they can evaluated based only
on the state of the individual robot, and on information that can be sensed
directly or through communication with immediate neighbors. We consider
intruders as robots which misbehave, i.e. do not follow the rules, because of
either spontaneous failures or malicious reprogramming. Our goal is to detect
intruders by observing the congruence of their behavior with the social rules
as applied to the current state of the overall system. Moreover, in accordance
with the fully distributed nature of the problem, the detection itself must be
peformed by individual robots, based only on local information. The paper
introduces a formalism that allows to model uniformly a large variety of
possible robot societies. The main contribution consists in the proposal of an
Intrusion Detection System, i.e. a protocol that, under suitabkle conditions,
allows individual robots to detect possible misbehaving robots in their
vicinity, and trigger possible further actions to secure the society. It is
worth noting that the generality of the protocol formalism makes so that local
monitors can be automatically generated once the cooperation rules and the
robot dynamics are specified. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
shown through application to examples of automated robotic systems.

depending on L_C. It is determined basically by the bias $V_{th}\sim \Delta$
for L_C smaller than the correlation length $\xi=W/\Delta$ where W denotes the

threshold is governed by the electric field, $V_{th}/L_C$, which is consistent
with a Landau-Zener-type breakdown, $V_{th}/L_C\propto \Delta^2/W$. We
demonstrate that the spatial dependence of the scalar potential is crucially
important for this crossover by showing the case without the scalar potential,
where the breakdown occurs at $V_{th}\sim \Delta$ regardless of the length L_C.

that, within an alpha prescription for the turbulence (anomalous viscosity and
diffusivity), the steady-state problem has been solved. Conditions for
launching jets are very stringent and require a large scale magnetic field
$B_z$ close to equipartition with the total (gas and radiation) pressure. The
total power feeding the jets decreases with the disc thickness: fat ADAF-like
structures with $h\sim r$ cannot drive super-Alfv\'enic jets. However, there
exist also hot, optically thin JED solutions that would be observationally very
similar to ADAFs.
  Finally, it is argued that variations in the large scale magnetic $B_z$ field
is the second parameter required to explain hysteresis cycles seen in LMXBs
(the first one would be $\dot M_a$).

escape in low permeability rocks, we performed time-resolved in situ X-ray
tomography imaging to investigate the processes that occur during the slow
heating (from 60\degree; to 400\degree;C) of organic-rich Green River shale. At
about 350\degree;C cracks nucleated in the sample, and as the temperature
continued to increase, these cracks propagated parallel to shale bedding and
coalesced, thus cutting across the sample. Thermogravimetry and gas
chromatography revealed that the fracturing occurring at ~350\degree;C was
associated with significant mass loss and release of light hydrocarbons
generated by the decomposition of immature organic matter. Kerogen
decomposition is thought to cause an internal pressure build up sufficient to
form cracks in the shale, thus providing pathways for the outgoing
hydrocarbons. We show that a 2D numerical model based on this idea
qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed dynamics of crack
nucleation, growth and coalescence, as well as the irregular outlines of the
cracks. Our results provide a new description of fracture pattern formation in
low permeability shales.

This paper discusses the efficiency of search-based algorithms (preferably
genetic algorithm) versus random testing, in soft- ware test-data generation.
This study differs from all previous studies due to sample programs (SUTs)
which are used. Since we want to in- crease the complexity of SUTs gradually,
and the program generation is automatic as well, Grammatical Evolution is used
to guide the program generation. SUTs are generated according to the grammar we
provide, with different levels of complexity. SUTs will first undergo genetic
al- gorithm and then random testing. Based on the test results, this paper
recommends one method to use for automation of software testing.

absorption intensity with and without magnetic field, exceeds 500% even at 0.6
T. The results arise from the fact that the spectral intensity of the
electromagnon critically depends on the magnetic structure. With changing the
conical spin structures in terms of the conical angle $\theta$ from the proper
screw ($\theta=0^\circ$) to the ferrimagnetic ($\theta=90^\circ$) through the
conical spin-ordered phases ($0^\circ<\theta<90^\circ$) by external magnetic
fields, we identify the maximal magnetochromism around $\theta\approx45^\circ$.
On the contrary, there is no remarkable signature of the electromagnon in the
proper screw and spin-collinear (ferrimagnetic) phases, clearly indicating the
important role of the conical spin order to produce the
magnetically-controllable electromagnons. The possible origin of this
electromagnon is argued in terms of the exchange-striction mechanism.

Deeper observations will give more insight into the distribution of diffuse gas
in the extended halo of the galaxies and the IGM, where numerical simulations
predict a cosmic web of extended structures and gaseous filaments. To observe
the extended environment of galaxies, column density sensitivities have to be
achieved that probe the regime of Lyman limit systems. HI observations are
typically limited to a brightness sensitivity of NHI~10^19 cm-2, but this must
be improved upon by ~2 orders of magnitude. In this paper we present the
interferometric data of the Westerbork Virgo HI Filament Survey (WVFS) - the
total power product of this survey has been published in an earlier paper. By
observing at extreme hour angles, a filled aperture is simulated of 300x25
meters in size, that has the typical collecting power and sensitivity of a
single dish telescope, but the well defined bandpass characteristics of an
interferometer. With the very good surface brightness sensitivity of the data,
we hope to make new HI detections of diffuse systems with moderate angular
resolution. The survey maps 135 degrees in Right Ascension between 8 and 17
hours and 11 degrees in Declination between -1 and 10 degrees, including the
galaxy filament connecting the Local Group with the Virgo Cluster. Only
positive declinations could be completely processed and analysed due to
projection effects. A typical flux sensitivity of 6 mJy beam-1 over 16 km s-1
is achieved, that corresponds to a brightness sensitivity of NHI~10^18 cm-2. In
total, 199 objects have been detected, of which 17 are new HI detections.

by the violation of a Bell inequality. The standard and easiest configuration
in which Bell inequalities can be measured has been proposed by
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH). However, alternative nonlocality tests can
also be carried out. In particular, Bell inequalities requiring multiple
measurement settings can provide deeper fundamental insights about quantum
nonlocality as well as offering advantages in the presence of noise and
detection inefficiency. In this article we show how these nonlocality tests can
be performed using a commercially available source of entangled photon pairs.
We report the violation of a series of these nonlocality tests (I3322, I4422
and chained inequalities). With the violation of the chained inequality with 4
settings per side we put an upper limit at 0.49 on the local content of the
states prepared by the source (instead of 0.63 attainable with CHSH). We also
quantify the amount of true randomness that has been created during our

achievable error rate performance is determined by signal detection strategy.
The optimal maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) that exhaustively examines all
symbol candidates has exponential complexity and may not be applicable in many
practical systems. In this paper, we consider a generalized minimum mean square
error (MMSE) detection derived from conditional mean estimation, which in
principle behaves equivalently to MLD but also includes a linear MMSE detection
as a special case. Motivated by this fact, we propose a low-complexity
detection which significantly reduces the number of examined symbol candidates
without significant error rate performance degradation from MLD. Our approach
is to approximate the probability density function (pdf) of modulated symbols
that appears in the exact conditional mean expression such that the decision
metric can be cast into a partially closed form. It is found that uniform ring
approximation in combination with phase shift keying (PSK) and amplitude phase
shift keying (APSK) is promising, as it can achieve a performance even
comparable to MLD, while its complexity is linear when the number of transmit
antennas is two.

Telescope, and reach down to the horizontal branch. In this relatively small
3.8 kpc by 3.8 kpc field, after correcting for Poisson noise, we do not find
any statistically strong evidence for the presence of small-scale
sub-structures in the stellar spatial distribution on scales greater than 100
pc. However, we do detect the presence of significant small spatial-scale
inhomogeneities in the stellar median metallicity over the surveyed field. We
argue that these localized chemical substructures could be associated with
not-fully mixed debris from the disruption of low mass systems. NGC 5128 joins
the ranks of the late-type spiral galaxies the Milky Way, for which the stellar
halo appears to be dominated by small-scale spatial sub-structures, and
NGC~891, where localized metallicity variations have been detected in the inner
extra-planar regions. This suggests that the presence of small-scale
sub-structures may be a generic property of stellar halos of large galaxies.

de Bure interferometer helped establish the origin of the emission detected and
the physical conditions in the emitting gas. The water line profile and its
spatial distribution are very similar to those of SiO. We find that the water
emission arises from warm ($\sim 200\K$), dense ($(1-2)\times 10^6\cmmt$) gas,

interplay between variable accretion and circumstellar extinction: since the
central luminosity of the system is dominated by accretion, a modest drop in
the accretion rate could induce the drastic restructuring of the inner disc.

and through laboratory experiments. The composite scatterer forms a system of
coupled resonators and gives rise to multiple low frequency resonances. The
corresponding analytical model employs polar angle dependent boundary
conditions on the surface of the N-slit cylinder. The solution inside the slits
assumes plane waves. It is shown also that in the low-frequency range the
N-slit rigid cylinder can be replaced by an equivalent fluid layer. Further
approximations suggest a simple square root dependence of the resonant
frequencies on the number of slits and this is confirmed by data. The observed
resonant phenomena are associated with Helmholtz-like behaviour of the
resonator for which the radius and width of the openings are much smaller than
the wavelength. The problem of scattering by a finite periodic array of such
coupled resonators in air is solved using multiple scattering techniques. The
resulting model predicts band-gap effects resulting from the resonances of the
individual composite scatterers below the first Bragg frequency . Predictions

insertion loss peaks related to the resonances within the concentric

predictions of the analytical approach and predictions of the equivalent fluid

tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ) by temperature-dependent
conductivity and current-voltage measurements. The individual domains have been
isolated by focused ion beam etching and electrically contacted by focused ion
and electron beam induced deposition of metallic contacts. The
temperature-dependent conductivity follows a variable range hopping behavior
which shows a crossover of the exponent as the Peierls transition is
approached. The low temperature behavior is analyzed within the segmented rod
model of Fogler, Teber and Shklowskii, as originally developed for a
charge-ordered quasi one-dimensional electron crystal. The results are compared
with data obtained on as-grown and electron irradiated epitaxial TTF-TCNQ thin

giving a detailed phenomenological picture of the variability properties and
their correlation with the energy spectrum (spectral state) of the source. Here
we take the truncated disc/hot inner flow picture which can describe the
spectral changes, and show that propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in
the hot flow can match the broad band power spectral properties seen in black
hole binaries, i.e. give approximately band limited noise between a low and
high frequency break. The low frequency break marks the viscous timescale at
the outer edge of the hot inner flow, which is the inner edge of the truncated
disc. The model also predicts the Lense-Thirring precession timescale of the
hot flow, as this is set by the surface density of the flow which is self
consistently calculated from the propagating fluctuations. We show that this
naturally gives the observed relation between the low frequency break and QPO
frequency as the outer radius of the flow moves inwards, and that this model
predicts many of the observed QPO properties such as correlation of coherence
with frequency, and of the recently discovered correlation of frequency with
flux on short timescales. We fit this total model of the variability to a
sequence of 5 observed power spectra from the bright black hole binary XTE
J1550-564 as the source transitioned from a low/hard to very high state. This
is the first time that a power spectrum from a black hole binary has been fit
with a physical model for the variability. The data are well fit if the inner
radius of the flow remains constant, while the outer radius sweeps inwards from
~60-12 Rg. This range of radii agrees with models of the energy spectral
evolution, giving the first self consistent description of the evolution of
both the spectrum and variability of BHB.

number of the TLS problem. For a TLS problem with data $A$, $b$, two formulas
are derived that are simpler and more compact than the known results in the
literature. One is derived by exploiting the properties of Kronecker products
of matrices. The other is obtained by making use of the singular value
decomposition (SVD) of $[A \,\,b]$, which allows us to compute the condition
number cheaply and accurately. We present lower and upper bounds for the
condition number that involve the singular values of $[A \,\, b]$ and the last
entries of the right singular vectors of $[A \,\, b]$. We prove that they are
always sharp and can estimate the condition number accurately by no more than
four times. Furthermore, we establish a few other lower and upper bounds that
involve only a few singular values of $A$ and $[A \,\, b]$. We discuss how
tight the bounds are. These bounds are particularly useful for large scale TLS
problems since for them any formulas and bounds for the condition number
involving all the singular values of $A$ and/or $[A \ b]$ are too costly to be
computed. Numerical experiments illustrate that our bounds are sharper than a
known approximate condition number in the literature.

field through the dynamo process. Cosmic-ray driven dynamo is one of the
galactic dynamo model, which has been successfully tested in case of the spiral
galaxies. We investigate this dynamo model in the ISM of a dIrr galaxy. We
study its efficiency under the influence of slow rotation, weak shear and
shallow gravitational potential. Additionally, the exploding supernovae are
parametrised by the frequency of star formation and its modulation, to
reproduce bursts and quiescent phases. We found that even slow galactic
rotation with a low shearing rate amplifies the magnetic field, and that rapid
rotation with a low value of the shear enhances the efficiency of the dynamo.
Our simulations have shown that a high amount of magnetic energy leaves the
simulation box becoming an efficient source of intergalactic magnetic fields.

formation and evolution of galaxies. It has been realized that the radiative
pressure feedback could be an efficient mechanism due to the existence of dust.
In this Letter, we discuss the effect of anisotropic radiative pressure, which
is inevitable if the UV/optical emission arises from an accretion disk. The
distribution of dusty gas should be also anisotropic due to the influence of
the anisotropic disk radiation, i.e. the dust in the face-on direction of an
accretion disk can be blown out relatively more easily, whereas the dust can
survive in the edge-on direction. This result can explain the presence of some
obscured AGNs with high Eddington ratios and can also quantitatively reproduce
the observed decreasing fraction of type 2 AGNs with increasing luminosity. A
sequence of AGN formation and evolution is also proposed, within the context of
the formation, evolution and exhaustion of the dusty torus. Our model predicts
the existence of bright AGNs with dusty tori, but without broad line regions.
Finally we discuss the implications of the anisotropic radiation for the
calculations of luminosity functions and radiation efficiencies of AGNs.

and larger peak distances were found in coronal hole spectra. We also compare
simultaneous Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta profiles. There is an obvious
correspondence between asymmetry and redshift for both lines, but, most
surprisingly, the asymmetries of Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta are opposite. We
conclude that in both cases downflows determine the line profile, in case of
Lyman-alpha by absorption and in the case of Ly-beta by emission. Our results
show that the magnetically structured atmosphere plays a dominating role in the

Our sample consists of 134 galaxies selected at 24\mum with a flux of S(24\mum)
> 0.9 mJy. We find many (~60%) of our sources to possess an important bulge
and/or central point source component, most of which reveal additional
underlying structures after subtraction of a best-fit sersic (or sersic+PSF)
profile. Based on visual inspection of the NIC2 images and their residuals, we
estimate that ~80% of all our sources are mergers. We calculate lower and upper
limits on the merger fraction to be 62% and 91% respectively. At z < 1.5, we
observe objects in early (pre-coalescence) merging stages to be mostly disk and
star formation dominated, while we find mergers to be mainly bulge-dominated
and AGN-starburst composites during coalescence and then AGN-dominated in late
stages. This is analogous to what is observed in local ULIRGs. At z \geq 1.5,
we find a dramatic rise in the number of objects in pre-coalescence phases of
merging, despite an increase in the preponderance of AGN signatures in their
mid-IR spectra and luminosities above 10^12.5 L_sun. We further find the
majority of mergers at those redshifts to retain a disk-dominated profile
during coalescence. We conclude that, albeit still driven by mergers, these
high-z ULIRGs are substantially different in nature from their local
counterparts and speculate that this is likely due to their higher gas content.
Finally, we observe obscured ({\tau}_{9.7\mum} > 3.36) quasars to live in faint
and compact hosts and show that these are likely high-redshift analogs of local
dense-core mergers. We find late-stage mergers to show predominantly unobscured
AGN spectra, but do not observe other morphological classes to occupy any one
specific region in the Spoon diagram. [abridged]

however, that absorption is tied to structures in the outer disk, and
blue-shifts are not typically observed. Here we report the detection of
blue-shifted He-like Fe XXV (3100 +/- 400 km/s) and H-like Fe XXVI (1000 +/-
200 km/s) absorption lines in a Chandra/HETG spectrum of the transient pulsar
and low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17480-2446 in Terzan 5. These features indicate
a disk wind with at least superficial similarities to those observed in
stellar-mass black holes. The wind does not vary strongly with numerous weak
X-ray bursts or flares. A broad Fe K emission line is detected in the spectrum,
and fits with different line models suggest that the inner accretion disk in
this system may be truncated. If the stellar magnetic field truncates the disk,
a field strength of B = 0.7-4.0 E+9 Gauss is implied, which is in line with
estimates based on X-ray timing techniques. We discuss our findings in the
context of accretion flows onto neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.

unidentified Fermi/LAT gamma-ray sources at high Galactic latitudes using
Suzaku. The studied objects were detected with high significance during the
first 3 months of Fermi/LAT operation, and subsequently better localized in the
Fermi/LAT 1 year catalog (1FGL). Possible associations with pulsars and active
galaxies have subsequently been discussed, and our observations provide an
important contribution to this debate. In particular, an X-ray point source was
found within the 95% confidence error circle of 1FGL J1231.1-1410. X-ray
spectrum is well-fitted by a blackbody with an additional power-law. This
supports the recently claimed identification of this source with a millisecond
pulsar (MSP) PSR J1231-1411. Concerning 1FGL J1311.7-3429, two X-ray sources
were found within the LAT error circle. Even though the X-ray spectral and
variability properties were accessed, their nature and relationship with the
gamma-ray source remain uncertain. We found several weak X-ray sources in the
field of 1FGL J1333.2+5056, one coinciding with CLASS J1333+5057. We argue the
available data are consistent with the association between these two objects.
Finally, we have detected an X-ray source in the vicinity of 1FGL J2017.3+0603.
This object was recently suggested to be associated with a newly discovered MSP
PSR J2017+0603, because of the spatial-coincidence and the gamma-ray pulse
detection. We have only detected the X-ray counterpart of the CLASS J2017+0603,
while we determined an X-ray flux upper limit at the pulsar position. All in
all, our studies indicate while a significant fraction of unidentified high
Galactic latitude gamma-ray sources is related to the pulsar and blazar
phenomena, associations with other classes of astrophysical objects are still
valid options.

for the noise parameter: over this threshold, the only equilibrium is the
uniform distribution, and under this threshold, there is also a family of
non-isotropic equilibria. We give a rigorous prove of convergence of the
solution to a steady-state as time goes to infinity. In particular we show that
in the supercritical case, the only initial conditions leading to the uniform

the symmetry energy defined at normal nuclear density $\rho_0 $ provide
important information on the equation of state (EOS) of isospin asymmetric
nuclear matter. While significant progress has been made in determining some
lower order bulk characteristic parameters, such as the energy $E_0(\rho_0)$
and incompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter as well as the symmetry
energy $E_{sym}(\rho_0)$ and its slope parameter $L$, yet the higher order bulk
characteristic parameters are still poorly known. Here, we analyze the
correlations between the lower and higher order bulk characteristic parameters
within the framework of Skyrme Hartree-Fock energy density functional and then
estimate the values of some higher order bulk characteristic parameters. In
particular, we obtain $J_0=-355 \pm 95$ MeV and $I_0=1473 \pm 680$ MeV for the
third-order and fourth-order derivative parameters of symmetric nuclear matter
at $\rho_0 $ and $K_{sym} = -100 \pm 165$ MeV, $J_{sym} = 224 \pm 385$ MeV,
$I_{sym} = -1309 \pm 2025$ MeV for the curvature parameter, third-order and

the empirical constraints on $E_0(\rho_0)$, $K_0$, $E_{sym}(\rho_0)$, $L$, and
the isoscalar and isovector nucleon effective masses. Furthermore, our results
indicate that the three parameters $E_0(\rho_0)$, $K_0$, and $J_0$ can
reasonably characterize the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter up to $2\rho_0 $
while the symmetry energy up to $2\rho_0 $ can be well described by
$E_{sym}(\rho_0)$, $L$, and $K_{sym}$.

the common experimental situation in which weakly interacting bosons are loaded

of peaks in the momentum distribution is then driven by interactions in a
lattice with essentially no tunnelling. The projection technique allows to us
to treat inhomogeneous (trapped) systems exactly in the case that
non-interacting bosons are loaded into the system initially, and we use
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group techniques to study the
system in the case of finite tunnelling in the lattice and finite initial
interactions. For systems of more than a few sites and particles, we find good
agreement with results calculated via a naive approach, in which the state at
each lattice site is described by a coherent state in the particle occupation
number. However, for systems on the order of 10 lattice sites, we find
experimentally measurable discrepancies to the results predicted by this

temperature of the environment. If the detuning exists, the Rabi oscillations
may show the behavior of collapses and revivals; however, if the detuning is

diluted by the expansion of the universe. As a result, cosmological magnetic
fields with residual strengths of astrophysical relevance are generally sought
by going outside standard cosmology, or by extending conventional
electromagnetic theory. Nevertheless, the survival of strong B-fields of
primordial origin is possible in spatially open Friedmann universes without
changing conventional electromagnetism. The reason is the hyperbolic geometry
of these spacetimes, which slows down the adiabatic magnetic decay-rate and
leads to their superadiabatic amplification on large scales. So far, the effect
has been found to operate on Friedmannian backgrounds containing either
radiation or a slow-rolling scalar field. We show here that the superadiabatic
amplification of large-scale magnetic fields, generated by quantum fluctuations
during inflation, is essentially independent of the type of matter that fills
the universe and appears to be a generic feature of open Friedmann spacetimes.
We estimate the late-time strength of any residual field in a marginally open
universe and show that it can easily meet the requirements for the dynamo
generation of the magnetic fields observed in galaxies today.
