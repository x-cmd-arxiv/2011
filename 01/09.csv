Results from the research showed that the ranking of the aesthetics values of
the web page interfaces measured of the users were congruent with the expected

triggering between events of different types proceeds through a one-dimension

distance $m$ of the events to the initial shock in the type space, where $0 <

to display rapid oscillations whose frequency is the Regge action. In this
note, we reformulate this result through a difference equation, asymptotically
satisfied by these models, and whose semi-classical solutions are precisely the
sine and the cosine of the Regge action. This equation is then interpreted as
coming from the canonical quantization of a simple constraint in Regge
calculus. This suggests to lift and generalize this constraint to the phase
space of loop quantum gravity parametrized by twisted geometries. The result is
a reformulation of the flat model for topological BF theory from the
Hamiltonian perspective. The Wheeler-de-Witt equation in the spin network basis
gives difference equations which are exactly recursion relations on the
15j-symbol. Moreover, the semi-classical limit is investigated using coherent
states, and produces the expected results. It mimics the classical constraint
with quantized areas, and for Regge geometries it reduces to the semi-classical
equation which has been introduced in the beginning.

set of two coupled perturbed sine-Gordon equations, we describe the tunneling
processes in linear long Josephson junctions (LJJs) and find that MQT in the
resonant cavity increases due to potential renomalization, induced by the
interaction between the fluxon and cavity.Enhancement of the MQT rate in the
weak-coupling regime is estimated by using the experimantally accessible range
of the model parameters. The tunneling rate from the metastable state is found
to increase weakly with increasing junction-cavity interaction strength.
However, the energy splitting between the two degenerate ground-states of the
double-well potential increases significantly with increasing both the
interaction strength and frequency of the resonant cavity mode. Finally, we
discuss how the resonant cavity may be used to tune the property of Josephson

J2141-0001, discovered as part of the SLACS survey. We present new Hubble Space
Telescope multicolor imaging, gas and stellar kinematics data derived from
long-slit spectroscopy, and K-band LGS adaptive optics imaging, both from the
Keck telescopes. We model the galaxy as a sum of concentric axisymmetric bulge,
disk and halo components and infer the contribution of each component, using
information from gravitational lensing and gas kinematics. This analysis yields
a best-fitting total (disk plus bulge) stellar mass of log_{10}(Mstar/Msun) =
10.99(+0.11,-0.25). The photometric data combined with stellar population
synthesis models yield log_{10}(Mstar/Msun) = 10.97\pm0.07, and 11.21\pm0.07
for the Chabrier and Salpeter IMFs, respectively. Accounting for the expected
gas fraction of \simeq 20% reduces the lensing plus kinematics stellar mass by
0.10\pm0.05 dex, resulting in a Bayes factor of 11.9 in favor of a Chabrier
IMF. The dark matter halo is roughly spherical, with minor to major axis ratio
q_{halo}=0.91(+0.15,-0.13). The dark matter halo has a maximum circular
velocity of V_{max}=276(+17,-18) km/s, and a central density parameter of
log_{10}\Delta_{V/2}=5.9(+0.9,-0.5). This is higher than predicted for
uncontracted dark matter haloes in LCDM cosmologies, log_{10}\Delta_{V/2}=5.2,
suggesting that either the halo has contracted in response to galaxy formation,
or that the halo has a higher than average concentration. At 2.2 disk scale
lengths the dark matter fraction is f_{DM}=0.55(+0.20,-0.15), suggesting that
SDSS J2141-0001 is sub-maximal.

electroweak theory, obtained by the insertion of the complete energy-momentum
tensor ($T$) on 2-point functions of neutral gauge currents ($VV'$). The vertex
defines the leading contribution to the effective action which accounts for the
conformal anomaly and related interaction between the Standard Model and
gravity. The energy momentum tensor is derived from the curved spacetime
Lagrangian in the linearized gravitational limit, and with the inclusion of the
term of improvement of a conformally coupled Higgs sector. As in the previous
cases of QED and QCD, we find that the conformal anomaly induces an effective
massless scalar interaction between gravity and the neutral currents in each
gauge invariant component of the vertex. This is described by the exchange of
an anomaly pole. We show that for a spontaneously broken theory the anomaly can
be entirely attributed to the poles only for a conformally coupled Higgs
scalar. In the exchange of a graviton, the trace part of the corresponding
interaction can be interpreted as due to an effective dilaton, using a local
version of the effective action. We discuss the implications of the anomalous
Ward identity for the $TVV'$ correlator for the structure of the gauge/gauge/
effective dilaton vertex in the effective action. The analogy between these
effective interactions and those related to the radion in theories with large
extra dimensions is pointed out.

embedded in a social context. A framework is presented which allows us to
measure the Windfall of Friendship, i.e., how much players benefit (compared to
purely selfish environments) if they care about the welfare of their friends in
the social network graph. As a case study, a virus inoculation game is
examined. We analyze the corresponding Nash equilibria and show that the
Windfall of Friendship can never be negative. However, we find that if the
valuation of a friend is independent of the total number of friends, the social
welfare may not increase monotonically with the extent to which players care
for each other; intriguingly, in the corresponding scenario where the relative
importance of a friend declines, the Windfall is monotonic again. This article
also studies convergence of best-response sequences. It turns out that in
social networks, convergence times are typically higher and hence constitute a
price of friendship. While such phenomena may be known on an anecdotal level,
our framework allows us to quantify these effects analytically. Our formal
insights on the worst case equilibria are complemented by simulations shedding
light onto the structure of other equilibria.

multi-stream cooperative MIMO systems with $M$ relay nodes. Traditionally,
relay selection approaches are primarily focused on selecting one relay node to
improve the transmission reliability given a single-antenna destination node.
As such, in the cooperative phase whereby both the source and the selected
relay nodes transmit to the destination node, it is only feasible to exploit
cooperative spatial diversity (for example by means of distributed space time
coding). For wireless systems with a multi-antenna destination node, in the
cooperative phase it is possible to opportunistically transmit multiple data
streams to the destination node by utilizing multiple relay nodes. Therefore,
we propose a low overhead multi-relay selection protocol to support
multi-stream cooperative communications. In addition, we derive the asymptotic
performance results at high SNR for the proposed scheme and discuss the
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as well as the throughput-reliability tradeoff.
From these results, we show that the proposed multi-stream cooperative
communication scheme achieves lower outage probability compared to existing
baseline schemes.

colloidal suspensions. Two means are used to investigate the structure; the
pair correlation function and a recently developed topological method. The
latter identifies structures topologically equivalent to ground state clusters
formed by isolated groups of 5 < m < 13 particles, which are specific to the
system under consideration. Our topological methodology shows that, in the case
of Lennard-Jones, the addition of attractions increases the system's ability to
form larger (m>8) clusters, although pair-correlation functions are almost
identical. Conversely, in the case of short-ranged attractions, pair
correlation functions show a significant response to adding attraction, while
the liquid structure exhibits a strong decrease in clustering upon adding
attractions. Finally, a compressed, weakly interacting system shows a similar
pair structure and topology.

in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV is described. The data sample was collected
with the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.1
inverse picobarns. Momentum and ionization-energy-loss measurements in the
inner tracker detector are used to identify tracks compatible with heavy
slow-moving particles. Additionally, tracks passing muon identification
requirements are also analyzed for the same signature. In each case, no
candidate passes the selection, with an expected background of less than 0.1
events. A lower limit at the 95% confidence level on the mass of a stable
gluino is set at 398 GeV/c^2, using a conventional model of nuclear
interactions that allows charged hadrons containing this particle to reach the
muon detectors. A lower limit of 311 GeV/c^2 is also set for a stable gluino in
a conservative scenario of complete charge suppression, where any hadron
containing this particle becomes neutral before reaching the muon detectors.

  emitters",,,"10.1103/PhysRevB.84.035305",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Residual strain plays a critical role in determining the crystalline quality
of nitride epitaxial layers and in modifying their band structure; this often
leads to several interesting physical phenomena. It is found, for example, that
compressive strain in AlxGa1-xN layers grown on AlyGa1-yN (x<y) templates
results in an anti-crossing of the valence bands at considerably much higher Al
composition than expected. This happens even in the presence of large and
negative crystal field splitting energy for AlxGa1-xN layers. A judicious
magnitude of the compressive strain can support vertical light emission (out of
the c-plane) from AlxGa1-xN quantum wells up to x\approx 0.80, which is
desirable for the development of deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes
designed to operate below 250nm with transverse electric polarization
characteristics.

Bayesian Block procedure to extract temporal descriptors of the bursts' initial
pulse complexes (IPCs). The sample comprises 12 and 41 bursts with and without
extended emission (EE) components, respectively. IPCs of non-EE bursts are
dominated by single pulse structures, while EE bursts tend to have two or more
pulse structures. The medians of characteristic timescales - durations, pulse
structure widths, and peak intervals - for EE bursts are factors of ~ 2-3
longer than for non-EE bursts. A trend previously reported by Hakkila and
colleagues unifying long and short bursts - the anti-correlation of pulse
intensity and width - continues in the two short burst groups, with non-EE
bursts extending to more intense, narrower pulses. In addition we find that
preceding and succeeding pulse intensities are anti-correlated with pulse
interval. We also examine the short burst X-ray afterglows as observed by the
Swift/XRT. The median flux of the initial XRT detections for EE bursts (~ 6 x
10^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1) is ~> 20 x brighter than for non-EE bursts, and the
median X-ray afterglow duration for EE bursts (~ 60,000 s) is ~ 30 x longer
than for non-EE bursts.
  The tendency for EE bursts toward longer prompt-emission timescales and
higher initial X-ray afterglow fluxes implies larger energy injections powering
the afterglows. The longer-lasting X-ray afterglows of EE bursts may suggest
that a significant fraction explode into more dense environments than non-EE
bursts, or that the sometimes-dominant EE component efficiently powers the
afterglow. Combined, these results favor different progenitors for EE and
non-EE short bursts.

Reichel on characterizations of balls in terms of the Riesz potential and
fractional Laplacian. For a bounded $C^1$ domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^N$,
we consider the Riesz-potential $$u(x)=\int_{\Omega}\frac{1}{|x-y|^{N-\alpha}}
\,dy$$ for $2\leq \alpha \not =N$. We show that $u=$ constant on the boundary
of $\Omega$ if and only if $\Omega$ is a ball. In the case of $ \alpha=N$, the
similar characterization is established for the logarithmic potential. We also
prove that such a characterization holds for the logarithmic Riesz potential.
This provides a characterization for the overdetermined problem of the
fractional Laplacian. These results answer two open questions of W. Reichel to
some extent.

Tully-Fisher (TF) catalog. For a sphere of radius $40 \hmpc$ centered on the
MW, we derive a bulk flow of $333 \pm 38\kms $ towards Galactic $
(l,b)=(276^\circ,14^\circ)$ within a $3^\circ$ $1\sigma$ error. Within a $
100\hmpc$ we get $ 257\pm 44\kms$ towards $(l,b)=(279^\circ, 10^\circ)$ within
a $6^\circ$ error. These directions are at a $40^\circ$ with the Supergalactic
plane, close to the apex of the motion of the Local Group of galaxies after the
Virgocentric infall correction. Our findings are consistent with the
$\Lambda$CDM model with the latest WMAP best fit cosmological parameters. But
the bulk flow allows independent constraints. For WMAP inferred Hubble
parameter $h=0.71$ and baryonic mean density parameter $\Omega_b=0.0449$, the
constraint from the bulk flow on the matter density $\Omega_m$, the
normalization of the density fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, and the growth index,
$\gamma$, can be expressed as
$\sigma_8\Omega_m^{\gamma-0.55}(\Omega_m/0.266)^{0.28}=0.86\pm 0.11$ (for
$\Omega_m\approx 0.266$). Fixing $\sigma_8=0.8$ and $\Omega_m=0.266$ as favored
by WMAP, we get $\gamma=0.495\pm 0.096$. The constraint derived here rules out
popular DGP models at more than the 99% confidence level. Our results are based
on a method termed \ace\ (All Space Constrained Estimate) which reconstructs
the bulk flow from an all space three dimensional peculiar velocity field
constrained to match the TF measurements. At large distances \ace\ generates a
robust bulk flow from the SFI++ that is insensitive to the assumed prior. For
comparison, a standard straightforward maximum likelihood estimate leads to
very similar results.
