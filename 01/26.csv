We give a detail analysis of variation in the broad Ha and Hb profiles, the
ratios, and the Balmer decrement of different line segments. Studying the
variability of the line profiles we explore the disk structure, that is assumed
to emit the broad double-peaked Ha and Hb emission lines. We divided the
observed spectra in two periods (before and after the outburst in 2002) and
analyzed separately the variation in these two periods. First we analyzed the
spectral emission-line profiles of Ha and Hb, measuring the peak positions.
Then, we divided lines into several segments, and we measured the line-segment
fluxes. The Balmer decrement variation for total Ha and Hb fluxes, as well as
for the line segments has been investigated and discussed. We modeled the line
parameters variation using an accretion disk model. We compared the variability
in the observed line parameters with the disk model predictions and found that
the variation in line profiles and in line segments corresponds to the emission
of a disk-like BLR. But, also there is probably one additional emission
component that contributes to the Ha and Hb line center. We found that the
variation in the line profiles is caused by the variation in the parameters of
the disk-like BLR, first of all in the inner (outer) radius which can well
explain the line parameter variations in the Period I. The Balmer decrement
across the line profile has a bell-like shape, and it is affected not only by
physical processes in the disk, but also by different emitting disk dimension
of the Ha and Hb line. The geometry of the BLR of 3C390.3 seems to be very
complex, and inflows/outflows might be present, but it is evident that the

only exists in a restricted area of the phase diagram as a function of chemical
potential imbalance and interaction strength. Applying an optical potential
along one direction enhances the FFLO region in this phase diagram. In this
paper, we construct the phase diagram as a function of polarization and
interaction strength in order to study the competition between the FFLO phase

phase separation, and provides a more direct connection with experiment.
Subsequently, we investigate the effects of the wavelength and the depth of the
optical potential, which is applied along one direction, on the FFLO state. It
is shown that the FFLO state can exist up to a higher level of spin imbalance
if the wavelength of the optical potential becomes smaller. Our results give

can exist, decreases when the interaction strength exceeds a certain critical
value. This counterintuitive phenomenon is discussed and the connection to the

the possibility of chaos in few shell systems; and (3) study the evolution of
many shell systems in the Vlasov limit.
  The proposed numerical integration scheme is a nearly energy conserving
hybrid of the Verlet and modified Euler-Cromer integration schemes.
  The rotational 2-shell spherical system is investigated in detail using the
hybrid numerical integration scheme. Plots of time-series, phase space
projections, Poincare sections, power spectra, and Lyapunov exponents are
obtained for the system. These diagnostic tools, taken together, clearly show
the chaotic nature of the rotational 2-shell system. Three types of periodic
orbits are observed: collapsed, one-point, and three-point periodic orbits. We
believe that the three-point periodic orbits result from a rotation-induced
bifurcation. Four types of quasiperiodic orbits are also observed. Three of
these are a result of slight changes in the initial conditions corresponding to
the three types of periodic orbits. The fourth type of quasiperiodic orbit
separates the chaotic region from the non-chaotic regions in phase space.
  The short-time evolution of collisionless spherical shells system is studied
using both numerical and analytical methods. Approximate expressions for the
short-time evolution of the collisionless rotational shells system are obtained
using Vlasov-Poisson perturbation theory in the high-virial limit. The
agreement between the analytical results and numerical results for finite

its sensitivity to external fields while extending phase coherence by three
orders of magnitude, to more than one second. With this technique we measure
magnetic fields with sensitivity of 25 pT/sqrt(Hz) and light shifts with an
uncertainty below 140 mHz after 1320 seconds of averaging. These sensitivities
are limited by quantum projection noise and, to our knowledge, are more than
two orders of magnitude better than with other single-spin probe technologies.
In fact, our reported sensitivity is sufficient for the measurement of parity
non-conservation, as well as the detection of the magnetic field of a single
electronic-spin one micrometer from an ion-detector with nanometer resolution.
As a first application we perform light shift spectroscopy of a narrow optical
quadruple transition. Finally, we emphasize that the quantum lock-in technique
is generic and can potentially enhance the sensitivity of any quantum sensor.

predicts a IMF composed predominantly of high-mass stars, in contrast to the
present-day IMF, which tends to yield stars with masses less than 1 M_Solar.
The leading theory for the transition in the characteristic stellar mass
predicts that the cause is the extra cooling provided by increasing metallicity
and in particular the cooling provided at high densities by dust. The aim of
this work is to test whether dust cooling can lead to fragmentation and be
responsible for this transition. To investigate this, we make use of
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. We follow the thermodynamic evolution
of the gas by solving the full thermal energy equation, and also track the
evolution of the dust temperature and the chemical evolution of the gas. We
model clouds with different metallicities, and determine the properties of the
cloud at the point at which it undergoes gravitational fragmentation. We follow
the further collapse to scales of an AU when we replace very dense,
gravitationally bound, and collapsing regions by a simple and nongaseous
object, a sink particle. Our results suggest that for metallicities as small as
10^{-5}Z_Solar, dust cooling produces low-mass fragments and hence can
potentially enable the formation of low mass stars. We conclude that dust
cooling affects the fragmentation of low-metallicity gas clouds and plays an
important role in shaping the stellar IMF even at these very low metallicities.
We find that the characteristic fragment mass increases with decreasing
metallicity, but find no evidence for a sudden transition in the behaviour of
the IMF within the range of metallicites examined in our present study.

information as `delicate correlations' in Hawking radiation, thus saving
unitarity while maintaining a semiclassical horizon. A recently derived
inequality showed that this belief is incorrect: one must have order unity
corrections to low energy evolution at the horizon (i.e. fuzzballs) to remove
entanglement between radiation and the hole. In this paper we take several
models of `small corrections' and compute the entanglement entropy numerically;
in each case this entanglement is seen to monotonically grow, in agreement with
the general inequality. We also construct a model of `burning paper', where the
entanglement is found to rise and then return to zero, in agreement with the
general arguments of Page. We then note that the fuzzball structure of string
microstates offers a version of `complementarity'. Low energy evolution is
modified by order unity, resolving the information problem, while for high
energy infalling modes ($E>> kT$) we may be able to replace correlators by
their ensemble averaged values. Israel (and others) have suggested that this
ensemble sum can be represented in the thermo-field-dynamics language as an
entangled sum over two copies of the system, giving the two sides of the
extended black hole diagram. Thus high energy correlators in a microstate may
be approximated by correlators in a spacetime with horizons, with the ensemble
sum over microstates acting like the `sewing' prescription of conformal field
theory.

combination of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the embedded cluster
mass function, described by a power law with index beta. The result of the
combination is a time-varying IMF which depends on the star formation rate. We
applied the IGIMF formalism to a chemical evolution model for the solar
neighbourhood and compared the results obtained by assuming three possible
values for beta with the ones obtained by means of a standard, well-tested,
constant IMF. In general, a lower absolute value of beta implies a flatter
IGIMF, hence a larger number of massive stars, higher Type Ia and II supernova
rates, higher mass ejection rates and higher [alpha/Fe] values at a given
metallicity. Our suggested fiducial value for beta is 2, since with this value
we can account for most of the local observables. We discuss our results in a
broader perspective, with some implications regarding the possible universality
of the IMF and the importance of the star formation threshold.

with \HI\ self-absorbing clouds in the inner Galaxy and that the CRRLs from the
innermost $\sim 10^{\circ}$ of the Galaxy arise in the Riegel-Crutcher (R-C)
cloud. The R-C cloud is amongst the most well known of \HI\ self-absorbing
(HISA) regions located at a distance of about 125 pc in the Galactic centre
direction. Taking the R-C cloud as an example, we demonstrate that the physical
properties of the HISA can be constrained by combining multi-frequency CRRL and
\HI\ observations. The derived physical properties of the HISA cloud are used
to determine the cooling and heating rates. The dominant cooling process is
emission of the \CII\ 158 \mum line whereas dominant heating process in the
cloud interior is photoelectric emission. Constraints on the FUV flux (G0
$\sim$ 4 to 7) falling on the R-C cloud are obtained by assuming thermal
balance between the dominant heating and cooling processes. The H$_2$ formation
rate per unit volume in the cloud interior is $\sim$ 10$^{-10}$ -- 10$^{-12}$
s$^{-1}$ \cmthree, which far exceeds the H$_2$ dissociation rate per unit
volume. We conclude that the self-absorbing cold \HI\ gas in the R-C cloud may
be in the process of converting to the molecular form. The cold \HI\ gas
observed as HISA features are ubiquitous in the inner Galaxy and form an
important part of the ISM. Our analysis shows that combining CRRL and \HI\ data
can give important insight into the nature of these cold gas. We also estimate
the integration times required to image the CRRL forming region with the
upcoming SKA pathfinders. Imaging with the MWA telescope is feasible with
reasonable observing times.

of n stages. The selection is sequential and depends on past observations as
well as the prior information. Observations from arm i are independent given a
distribution P_i, and, following Clayton and Berry (1985), P_i's have
independent Dirichlet process priors. The objective is to maximize the expected
future-discounted sum of the n observations. We study structural properties of
the bandit, in particular how the maximum expected payoff and the optimal
strategy vary with the Dirichlet process priors. The main results are (i) for a
particular arm and a fixed prior weight, the maximum expected payoff increases
as the mean of the Dirichlet process prior becomes larger in the increasing
convex order; (ii) for a fixed prior mean, the maximum expected payoff
decreases as the prior weight increases. Specializing to the one-armed bandit,
the second result captures the intuition that, given the same immediate payoff,
the more is known about an arm, the less desirable it becomes because there is
less to learn when selecting that arm. This extends some results of Gittins and
Wang (1992) on Bernoulli bandits and settles a conjecture of Clayton and Berry

previously undetected in X-ray observations. Our preliminary results for MACS
J0717.5+3745 demonstrate the complementarity these observations provide when
combined with X-ray observations of the thermal emission and radio observations
of the non-thermal emission. And finally, by revisiting RX J1347.5-1145, we

thermal electron pressure through a cluster, these redshift independent

astrophysics in high-z clusters.

this result. It is the consequence of one fact, which is based on combinatorics
of words. Let l, n and d>n be positive integers. Then all the words over
alphabet of cardinality l which length is greater than Psi(n,d,l) are either
n-divided or contain d-th power of subword, where a word W is n-divided, if it
can be represented in the following form W=W_0 W_1...W_n such that W_1 >'

proved that the set of non n-divided words over alphabet of cardinality l has
bounded height h over the set Y consisting of all the words of degree <n.

concretely, this approach involves Born-Oppenheimer and WKB ansatze and some
accompanying approximations. In this paper, I investigate this approach for
concrete scaled relational particle mechanics models, i.e. models featuring
only relative separations, relative angles and relative times. I consider the
heavy-light interaction term in the light quantum equation - necessary for the
semiclassical approach to work, firstly as an emergent-time dependent
perturbation of the emergent-time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the light
subsystem. Secondly, I consider a scheme in which the backreaction is small but
non-negligible, so that the l-subsystem also affects the form of the emergent
time. I also suggest that the many terms involving expectation values of the
light wavefunctions in both the (unapproximated) heavy and light equations
might require treatment in parallel to the Hartree--Fock self-consistent
approach rather than merely being discarded; for the moment this paper provides
a counterexample to such terms being smaller than their unaveraged

determination of macromolecules via coherent x-ray scattering. During
ultrashort and ultraintense x-ray pulses with an atomic scale wavelength,
samples are subject to radiation damage and possibly become highly ionized,
which may influence the quality of x-ray scattering patterns. We develop a
toolkit to treat detailed ionization, relaxation, and scattering dynamics for
an atom within a consistent theoretical framework. The coherent x-ray
scattering problem including radiation damage is investigated as a function of
x-ray FEL parameters such as pulse length, fluence, and photon energy. We find
that the x-ray scattering intensity saturates at a fluence of ~10^7
photons/{\AA}^2 per pulse, but can be maximized by using a pulse duration much
shorter than the time scales involved in the relaxation of the inner-shell
vacancy states created. Under these conditions, both inner-shell electrons in a
carbon atom are removed, and the resulting hollow atom gives rise to a
scattering pattern with little loss of quality for a spatial resolution > 1
{\AA}. Our numerical results predict that in order to scatter from a carbon
atom 0.1 photons per x-ray pulse, within a spatial resolution of 1.7 {\AA}, a
fluence of 10^7 photons/{\AA}^2 per pulse is required at a pulse length of 1 fs
and a photon energy of 12 keV. By using a pulse length of a few hundred
attoseconds, one can suppress even secondary ionization processes in extended
systems. The present results suggest that high-brightness attosecond x-ray FELs
would be ideal for single-shot imaging of individual macromolecules.

radio-luminous AGN that presently cannot be explained within this framework --
the `low-excitation' radio AGN (LERAGN). Recently, a scenario has been put
forward which predicts that LERAGN, and their regular `high-excitation' radio
AGN (HERAGN) counterparts represent different (red sequence vs. green valley)
phases of galaxy evolution. These different evolutionary states are also
expected to be reflected in their host galaxy properties, in particular their
cold gas content. To test this, here we present CO(1-0) observations toward a
sample of 11 of these systems conducted with CARMA. Combining our observations
with literature data, we derive molecular gas masses (or upper limits) for a
complete, representative, sample of 21 z<0.1 radio AGN. Our results yield that
HERAGN on average have a factor of ~7 higher gas masses than LERAGN. We also
infer younger stellar ages, lower stellar, halo, and central supermassive black
masses, as well as higher black hole accretion efficiencies in HERAGN relative

AGN form two physically distinct populations of galaxies that reflect different

interesting phenomenological possibilities. In one, late decays repopulate the
symmetric dark matter component, providing a new mechanism for generating a
large annihilation rate at the present epoch and allowing for mixed warm/cold
dark matter. In a second scenario, dark matter mixes with the active neutrinos,
thus presenting a distinct method to populate sterile neutrino dark matter

the ratio of alpha elements (such as oxygen) to iron is the smallest. In fact,
iron is mainly produced from type Ia supernovae on a timescale of ~ 0.1-1
billion years, while the alpha elements come from massive stars on timescales
of a few tens of million years (Matteucci 1994). Reproducing such a alpha/Fe
correlation has long been a severe problem for cosmological theories of galaxy
formation, which envisage massive galaxies to assemble gradually from smaller
progenitors, and to be characterized by a star formation history too much
extended towards late cosmic times. While it has recently become clear that
feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity play a role in the late
quenching of star formation (e.g. Cattaneo et al. 2009), and that early star
formation history in the galaxy progenitors affect the alpha/Fe ratio (Calura &
Menci 2009), major mergers alone cannot enhance the star formation in the
high-redshift progenitors to the levels required to match the steepness of the
observed alpha/Fe correlation (Spolaor et al. 2010). Here we report that the
inclusion of the effects of fly-by 'harassments', that trigger lower level
starbursts, combined with the AGN quenching of the starburst activity,
considerably enhances the capability to account for the observed alpha/Fe ratio
in ellipticals within cosmological galaxy formation models . The critical
difference between the earlier work and the present result is the effect of
starbursts driven by fly-by encounters that would have been very common amongst
the high-redshift progenitors of massive galaxies and which would have boosted
star formation in the first 2 billion years after the Big Bang, combined with

the low efficiency of star formation, but the exact form of the feedback is
uncertain. In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel
numerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted
to the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic
cooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so
that the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies
reach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to
form giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,
stellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This
collapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the
Milky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation
efficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.
Moreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically
imposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density
scaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star
formation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense
gas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar
feedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced
turbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In
these simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed
observed galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,
demonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star
formation in galaxies.

X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. The strongest correlation was found during the
hard state (also known as the `plateau' state), where a steady AU-scale jet is
known to exist. Both the radio and X-ray emission were found to decay from the
start of most plateau states, with the radio emission decaying faster. An
empirical relationship of $S_{\rm{radio}}\propto S_{\rm{X-ray}}^{\xi}$ was then
fitted to data taken only during the plateau state, resulting in a power-law
index of $\xi\sim1.7\pm0.3$, which is significantly higher than in other black
hole XRBs in a similar state. An advection-flow model was then fitted to this
relationship and compared to the universal XRB relationship as described by
Gallo et al. (2003). We conclude that either (I) the accretion disk in this
source is radiatively efficient, even during the continuous outflow of a
compact jet, which could also suggest a universal turn-over from radiatively
inefficient to efficient for all stellar-mass black holes at a critical mass
accretion rate ($\dot{m}_{\rm{c}}\approx10^{18.5}$ g/s); or (II) the X-rays in

that non-masing galaxies tend to have clumpy dust geometries commonly
associated with AGN, while OHMs have deeper absorption consistent with a
smooth, thick dust shell. Statistical analyses show that the major differences
between masing and non-masing ULIRGs in the mid-IR relate to the optical depth

30-20 um spectral slope from the IRS data. Dust temperatures of 40-80 K derived
from the IRS data are consistent with predictions of OH pumping models and with
a minimum T_dust required for maser production. The best-fit dust opacities
({\tau}_V ~ 100 - 400), however, are nearly an order of magnitude larger than
those predicted for OH inversion, and suggest that modifications to the model

factor of a few than local ETGs of analogous stellar mass. We present numerical
simulations of the effect of baryonic mass loss on the structure of a
spheroidal stellar system, embedded in a dark matter halo. This process,
invoked as a possible explanation of the observed size increase of ETGs since z
\sim 2, could be caused either by QSO/starburst driven galactic winds, promptly
ejecting from Early Type Galaxies (ETGs) the residual gas and halting star
formation (galactic winds), or by stellar mass returned to the ISM in the final
stages of stellar evolution. Indeed, we find that a conceivable loss of about
50% of the baryonic mass can produce a significant size increase. However, the
puffing up due to galactic winds occurs when the stellar populations are much
younger than the estimated ages >0.5 Gyr of compact high-z ETGs. Therefore,
while it may have had a role in deciding the final structure of ETGs, it cannot
explain the evolution observed so far of their size-mass relation; its
signature should be searched for in much younger systems. Conversely, the mass
loss due to stellar evolution could cause a relatively modest expansion of
passively evolving stellar systems later on, contributing to, without
dominating, the observed evolution of their mass-size relationship.

explanations for these variations have been proposed, with important
implications for the formation of the Solar System: heterogeneous seeding of
the disk with dust from a supernova, or energetic-particle irradiation of dust

carrier(s) of the 54Cr anomalies. Here we report the results of our recent
NanoSIMS imaging search for the 54Cr-rich carrier in the acid-resistant residue
of the CI chondrite Orgueil. A total of 10 regions with extreme 54Cr-excesses
({\delta}54Cr values up to 1500 %) were found. Comparison between SEM, Auger
and NanoSIMS analyses showed that these 54Cr-rich regions are associated with
one or more sub-micron (typically less than 200 nm) Cr oxide grains, most
likely spinels. Because the size of the NanoSIMS primary O- ion beam is larger
than the typical grain size on the sample mount, the measured anomalies are
lower limits, and we estimate that the actual 54Cr enrichments in three grains
are at least 11 times Solar and in one of these may be as high as 50 times
Solar. Such compositions strongly favor a Type II supernova origin. The
variability in bulk 54Cr/52Cr between meteorite classes argues for a

by the O-isotopic distribution and variable abundances in different planetary

are examined within the framework of a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The main
emphasis of this study is the normal ground state, which is realized at
sufficiently high temperatures and/or sufficiently large chemical potentials.
In contrast to the vacuum state, which is characterized by the magnetic
catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking, the normal state is accompanied by the
dynamical generation of the chiral shift parameter $\Delta$. In the chiral
limit, the value of $\Delta$ determines a relative shift of the longitudinal
momenta (along the direction of the magnetic field) in the dispersion relations
of opposite chirality fermions. We argue that the chirality remains a good
approximate quantum number even for massive fermions in the vicinity of the
Fermi surface and, therefore, the chiral shift is expected to play an important
role in many types of cold dense relativistic matter, relevant for applications
in compact stars. The qualitative implications of the revealed structure of the
normal ground state on the physics of protoneutron stars are discussed. A
noticeable feature of the $\Delta$ parameter is that it is insensitive to
temperature when $T \ll \mu_0$, where $\mu_0$ is the chemical potential, and
{\it increases} with temperature for $T > \mu_0$. The latter implies that the
chiral shift parameter is also generated in the regime relevant for heavy ion
collisions.

are able to reproduce the crucial effects of frequency-variable gas opacities,
a situation omnipresent in physics and astrophysics. We also account for the
energy exchange between neighbouring groups which is important in flows with
strong velocity divergence. These terms were computed using a finite volume
method in the frequency domain. The radiative transfer aspect of the method was
first tested separately for global consistency (reversion to grey model) and
against a well established kinetic model through Marshak wave tests with
frequency dependent opacities. Very good agreement between the multigroup M1
and kinetic models was observed in all tests. The successful coupling of the
multigroup radiative transfer to the hydrodynamics was then confirmed through a
second series of tests. Finally, the model was linked to a database of
opacities for a Xe gas in order to simulate realistic multigroup radiative
shocks in Xe. The differences with the previous grey models are discussed.

imperative to develop tools to provide traffic flow managers with the
information required to support decision making. In particular,
decision-support tools for traffic flow management should aid in limiting
controller workload and complexity, while supporting increases in air traffic
throughput. While many decision-support tools exist for short-term traffic
planning, few have addressed the strategic needs for medium- and long-term
planning for time horizons greater than 30 minutes. This paper seeks to address
this gap through the introduction of 3D aircraft proximity maps that evaluate
the future probability of presence of at least one or two aircraft at any given
point of the airspace. Three types of proximity maps are presented: presence
maps that indicate the local density of traffic; conflict maps that determine
locations and probabilities of potential conflicts; and outliers maps that
evaluate the probability of conflict due to aircraft not belonging to dominant
traffic patterns. These maps provide traffic flow managers with information
relating to the complexity and difficulty of managing an airspace. The intended
purpose of the maps is to anticipate how aircraft flows will interact, and how
outliers impact the dominant traffic flow for a given time period. This
formulation is able to predict which ""critical"" regions may be subject to
conflicts between aircraft, thereby requiring careful monitoring. These
probabilities are computed using a generative aircraft flow model. Time-varying
flow characteristics, such as geometrical configuration, speed, and probability
density function of aircraft spatial distribution within the flow, are
determined from archived Enhanced Traffic Management System data, using a
tailored clustering algorithm. Aircraft not belonging to flows are identified
as outliers.

in accretion flows onto thin dark matter filaments of cosmic structure
formation. The flow compresses the ambient magnetic field to strongly increase
and align it with the filament. Particles begin the acceleration by the ExB
drift with the accretion flow. The energy gain in the drift regime is limited
by the conservation of the adiabatic invariant p_perp^2/B. Upon approaching the
filament, the drift turns into the gyro-motion around the filament so that the
particle moves parallel to the azimuthal electric field. In this 'betatron'
regime the acceleration speeds up to rapidly reach the electrodynamic limit
$cp_{max}=eBR$ for an accelerator with magnetic field $B$ and the orbit radius
$R$ (Larmor radius). The periodic orbit becomes unstable and the particle
slings out of the filament to the region of a weak (uncompressed) magnetic
field, which terminates the acceleration.
  The mechanism requires pre-acceleration that is likely to occur in structure
formation shocks upstream or nearby the filament accretion flow. Previous
studies identify such shocks as efficient proton accelerators to a firm upper
limit ~10^19.5 eV placed by the catastrophic photo-pion losses. The present
mechanism combines explosive energy gain in its final (betatron) phase with
prompt particle release from the region of strong magnetic field. It is this
combination that allows protons to overcome both the photo-pion and the
synchrotron-Compton losses and therefore attain energy 10^21 eV. A requirement
on accelerator to reach a given E_max placed by the accelerator energy
dissipation \propto E_{max}^{2}/Z_0 due to the finite vacuum impedance Z_0 is
circumvented by the cyclic operation of the accelerator.

R Coronae Borealis-like fading event in its optical lightcurve. The only other
CSPN to show these events are CPD-568032 (Hen 3-1333) and V651 Mon (NGC 2346).
Dust cloud formation in the line of sight appears responsible but the exact
triggering mechanism is not well understood. Understanding how planetary
nebulae (PNe) trigger dust obscuration events may help understand the same
process in a wide range of objects including Population-I WC9 stars, symbiotic
stars and perhaps Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with long secondary
periods (LSPs). A binary scenario involving an eccentric, wide companion that
triggers dust formation via interaction at periastron is a potential
explanation that has been suggested for LSP variables. Model fits to the
lightcurves of CPD-568032 and M 2-29 show the dust forms in excess of 70 AU at
the inner edge of a dust disk. In the case of CPD-568032 this radius is far too
large to coincide with a binary companion trigger, although a binary may have
been responsible for the formation of the dust disk. We find no direct evidence
to support previous claims of binarity in M 2-29 either from the OGLE
lightcurve or deep medium-resolution VLT FLAMES spectroscopy of the CSPN. We
classify the CSPN as Of(H) with T_eff=50+-10 kK and log g=4.0+-0.3. We find a
mean distance of 7.4+-1.8 kpc to M 2-29 at which the M_V=-0.9 mag CSPN could
potentially hide a subgiant luminosity or fainter companion. A companion would
help explain the multiple similarities with D'-type symbiotic stars whose outer
nebulae are thought to be bona-fide PNe. The 7.4 kpc distance, oxygen abundance
of 8.3 dex and Galactic coordinates (l=4.0, b=-3.0) prove that M 2-29 is a
Galactic Bulge PN and not a Halo PN as commonly misconceived.

also show that direct particle pair exchange processes promote the formation of
regular spiral structures. Moreover, upon increasing the rates of mobility, we
observe a remarkable change in the extinction properties in the May--Leonard
system (for small system sizes): (1) As the mobility rate exceeds a threshold
that separates a species coexistence (quasi-)steady state from an absorbing
state, the mean extinction time as function of system size N crosses over from
a functional form ~ e^{cN} / N (where c is a constant) to a linear dependence;
(2) the measured histogram of extinction times displays a corresponding
crossover from an (approximately) exponential to a Gaussian distribution. The

are ~10^3 real astronomical point-sources with the measured colours of the
target quasars, of which only ~10 are expected to be HZQs. Applying Bayesian
model comparison to the sample reveals that most sources with HZQ-like colours
have P_q <~ 0.1 and can be confidently rejected without the need for any
further observations. In the case of the UKIDSS DR7 LAS, there were just 88
candidates with P_q >= 0.1; these object were prioritized for reobservation by
ranking according to P_q (and their likely redshift, which was also inferred
from the photometric data). Most candidates were rejected after one or two
(moderate depth) photometric measurements by recalculating P_q using the new
data. That left seven confirmed HZQs, three of which were previously identified
in the SDSS and four of which were new UKIDSS discoveries. The high efficiency
of this Bayesian selection method suggests that it could usefully be extended

and they are common, with of order 100 -- 300 million in the Galaxy. As such
they will be significant, probably dominant, sources of the gravitational waves
detectable by LISA. In the context of LISA's goals for fundamental physics,
double white dwarfs are a source of noise, but from an astrophysical
perspective, they are of considerable interest in their own right. In this
paper I discuss our current knowledge of double white dwarfs and their close
relatives (and possible descendants) the AM~CVn stars. LISA will add to our
knowledge of these systems by providing the following unique constraints: (i)
an almost direct measurement of the Galactic merger rate of DWDs from the
detection of short period systems and their period evolution, (ii) an accurate
and precise normalisation of binary evolution models at the shortest periods,
(iii) a determination of the evolutionary pathways to the formation of AM~CVn
stars, (iv) measurements of the influence of tidal coupling in white dwarfs and
its significance for stabilising mass transfer, and (v) discovery of numerous
examples of eclipsing white dwarfs with the potential for optical follow-up to
test models of white dwarfs.

recently a manned mission to an NEO was announced as a NASA goal. Efforts to
find and select suitable targets (plus backup targets) are severely hampered by
our lack of knowledge of the physical properties of dynamically favorable NEOs.
In particular, current mission scenarios tend to favor primitive low-albedo
objects. For the vast majority of NEOs the albedo is unknown.
  Here we report new constraints on the size and albedo of 65 NEOs with
rendezvous deltaV < 7 km/s. Our results are based on thermal-IR flux data
obtained in the framework of our ongoing (2009--2011) ExploreNEOs survey
(Trilling et al. 2010) using NASA's ""Warm Spitzer"" space telescope. As of 2010
July 14, we have results for 293 objects in hand (including the 65 low-deltaV
NEOs presented here); before the end of 2011 we expect to have measured the
size and albedo of ~ 700 NEOs (including probably ~ 160 low-deltaV NEOs).
  While there are reasons to believe that primitive volatile-rich materials are
universally low in albedo, the converse need not be true: the orbital evolution
of some dark objects likely has caused them to lose their volatiles by coming
too close to the Sun. For all our targets, we give the closest perihelion
distance they are likely to have reached (using orbital integrations from
Marchi et al. 2009) and corresponding upper limits on the past surface
temperature. Low-deltaV objects for which both albedo and thermal history may
suggest a primitive composition include (162998) 2001 SK162, (68372) 2001 PM9,
and (100085) 1992 UY4.

provably converges to the viscosity solution. The resulting system is solved

quantum dots coupled in series, with particular attention being paid to the
unique features originating from level renormalization. It is clearly
illustrated that the energy renormalization gives rise to a dynamic charge
blockade mechanism, which eventually results in super-Poissonian noise.
Coupling of the double dots to an external heat bath leads to dephasing and
relaxation mechanisms, which are demonstrated to suppress the noise in a unique
way.

been explained within two competing scenarios such as the spin-fluctuation
theory based on an itinerant picture and the slave-particle approach based on a
localized picture. In this study we propose an alternative scenario for the
anomalous transport within the context of the slave-particle approach. Although
the marginal Fermi-liquid phenomenology was interpreted previously within
deconfinement of the compact gauge theory, referred to as the strange metal
phase, we start from confinement, introducing the Polyakov-loop parameter into
an SU(2) gauge theory formulation of the t-J model. The Polyakov-loop parameter
gives rise to incoherent electrons through the confinement of spinons and
holons, which result from huge imaginary parts of self-energy corrections for
spinons and holons. This confinement scenario serves a novel mechanism for the
marginal Fermi-liquid transport in the respect that the scattering source has
nothing to do with symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the incoherent Fermi-liquid
state evolves into the Fermi liquid phase through crossover instead of an
artificial second-order transition as temperature is lowered, where the
crossover phenomenon does not result from the Anderson-Higgs mechanism but
originate from an energy scale in the holon sector. We fit an experimental data
for the electrical resistivity around the optimal doping and find a reasonable
match between our theory and the experiment.

dual to a four dimensional BH emitting the Hawking radiation through some
quantum fields. In this scenario, the number of the quantum field species is so
large that this radiation changes the orbital evolution of a BH binary. We
derived the correction to the gravitational waveform phase due to this effect
and estimated the upper bounds on $\ell$ by performing Fisher analyses. We
found that DECIGO/BBO can put a stronger constraint than the current table-top
result by detecting gravitational waves from small mass BH/BH and BH/neutron
star (NS) binaries. Furthermore, DECIGO/BBO is expected to detect 10$^5$ BH/NS
binaries per year. Taking this advantage, we found that DECIGO/BBO can actually
measure $\ell$ down to $\ell=0.33 \mu$m for 5 year observation if we know that
binaries are circular a priori. This is about 40 times smaller than the upper
bound obtained from the table-top experiment. On the other hand, when we take
eccentricities into binary parameters, the detection limit weakens to $\ell=1.5
\mu$m due to strong degeneracies between $\ell$ and eccentricities. We also
derived the upper bound on $\ell$ from the expected detection number of extreme
mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with LISA and BH/NS binaries with DECIGO/BBO,
extending the discussion made recently by McWilliams. We found that these less
robust constraints are weaker than the ones from phase differences.

  For the polar region of Jupiter we find for wl=6000 A a very strong radial
polarization with a seeing corrected maximum of about +11.5% in the South and
+10.0% in the North. Our model calculations demonstrate that the high limb
polarization can be explained by strongly polarizing (p~1.0), high albedo
(omega~0.98) haze particles with a scattering asymmetry parameter of g~0.6 as
expected for aggregate particles. The deduced particle parameters are
distinctively different when compared to lower latitude regions.
  The spectropolarimetry of Jupiter shows a decrease in the polar limb
polarization towards longer wavelengths and a significantly enhanced
polarization in strong methane bands when compared to the adjacent continuum.
For lower latitudes the fractional polarization is small, negative, and it
depends only little on wavelength except for the strong CH4-band at 8870 A.
  The South pole of Saturn shows a lower polarization (p~1.0-1.5%) than the
poles of Jupiter. The spectropolarimetric signal for Saturn decrease rapidly
with wavelength and shows no significant enhancements in the fractional
polarization in the absorption bands. These properties can be explained by a
vertically extended stratospheric haze region composed of small particles
<100nm.
  In addition we find a previously not observed strong polarization feature
(p=1.5-2.0%) near the equator of Saturn. The origin of this polarization signal
is unclear but it could be related to a seasonal effect.

will be presented before briefly discussing the calculations for the
one-dimensional and two-dimensional models. After this we will focus on the
Union Jack lattice and specifically the work of Wu and Lin in their 1987 paper

These features, which are common in complex systems, impact the attribution of
trends and the occurrence and clustering of extremes. The risk assessment of
systems with these properties will lead to different outcomes (e.g. return

assuming a partial ordering of the received bits in order to avoid the complex

configurations: for positive cosmological constant we have wormholes which
expand forever and, for negative cosmological constant we have wormholes which
expand to a maximum value and then recollapse. In the absence of a cosmological
constant the wormhole expands with constant velocity, i.e without acceleration
or deceleration. In 2+1 dimensions the expanding wormholes always have an
isotropic and homogeneous pressure, depending only on the time coordinate.

related to the neutron star, such as, mass determination, accretion physics,

by the neutron star. In this review, I present the observational evidence
accumulated in recent years on the interaction between the circumstellar disc

the disc. As a result, the equatorial discs in Be/X-ray binaries are smaller

new concepts based on comparing observations and finding the resemblance
between the observations. In the model, the new observations are compared with
the templates which have been derived from the previous experiences. In the
first stage, the objects are first represented through a geometric description
which is used for finding the object boundaries and a descriptor which is
inspired by the human visual system and then they are fed into the model. Next,
the new observations are identified through comparing them with the
previously-learned templates and are used for producing new templates. The
comparisons are made based on measures like Euclidean or correlation distance.
The new template is created by applying onion-pealing algorithm. The algorithm
consecutively uses convex hulls which are made by the points representing the
objects. If the new observation is remarkably similar to one of the observed
categories, it is no longer utilized in creating a new template. The existing
templates are used to provide a description of the new observation. This
description is provided in the templates space. Each template represents a
dimension of the feature space. The degree of the resemblance each template
bears to each object indicates the value associated with the object in that
dimension of the templates space. In this way, the description of the new
observation becomes more accurate and detailed as the time passes and the
experiences increase. We have used this model for learning and recognizing the
new polygons in the polygon space. Representing the polygons was made possible
through employing a geometric method and a method inspired by human visual
system. Various implementations of the model have been compared. The evaluation
results of the model prove its efficiency in learning and deriving new
templates.

long-duration BATSE gamma-ray bursts should lie at redshifts larger than 5.
This point-of-view follows from the natural assumption that fainter objects
should, on average, lie at larger redshifts. However, redshifts larger than 5
are rare for bursts observed by Swift, seemingly contradicting the BATSE
estimates. The purpose of this article is to clarify this contradiction. We
derive the cosmological relationships between the observed and emitted
quantities, and we arrive at a prediction that can be tested on the ensembles
of bursts with determined redshifts. This analysis is independent on the
assumed cosmology, on the observational biases, as well as on any gamma-ray
burst model. Four different samples are studied: 8 BATSE bursts with redshifts,
13 bursts with derived pseudo-redshifts, 134 Swift bursts with redshifts, and 6
Fermi bursts with redshifts. The controversy can be explained by the fact that
apparently fainter bursts need not, in general, lie at large redshifts. Such a
behaviour is possible, when the luminosities (or emitted energies) in a sample
of bursts increase more than the dimming of the observed values with redshift.
In such a case dP(z)/dz > 0 can hold, where P(z) is either the peak-flux or the
fluence. All four different samples of the long bursts suggest that this is
really the case. This also means that the hundreds of faint, long-duration
BATSE bursts need not lie at high redshifts, and that the observed redshift
distribution of long Swift bursts might actually represent the actual
distribution.

jet termination structures. The evolution of the jet termination regions during
the life of a high-mass microquasar is simulated to improve the present

object. We have performed 2D numerical simulations of jets propagating in
different scenarios, corresponding to different epochs after the formation of
the high-mass X-ray binary, using the code Ratpenat. We have also made simple
estimates of the non-thermal emission that could be produced in the jet
termination regions. We find that, in the way through the hot and tenuous
medium of the shocked wind/SNR ejecta, the jet suffers recollimation shocks in
which it loses part of its thrust and ends in a strong shock inflating a hot
cocoon. The jet head propagates with a speed similar to the medium sound speed,
until it eventually reaches the denser and colder shocked ISM and the
unperturbed ISM later on. In these last stages of evolution, the jet is
significantly slowed down and can be disrupted. For relatively old sources, the
microquasar peculiar velocity becomes important, leading to complete jet
destruction. Extended non-thermal radiation can be generated in the jet

the laws of nature, as stated by many distinguished scientists, notably
Eddington and Einstein, its position appears to be also quite peculiar. Given
the atomic nature of matter, whose behaviour is well described by statistical
physics, the second law could not hold unconditionally, but only statistically.
It is not an absolute law. As a result of this, in the present paper we try to
argue that we have not yet any truly cogent argument (known fundamental
physical laws) to exclude its possible macroscopic violation. Even Landauer's
information-theoretic principle seems to fall short of the initial expectations
of being the fundamental `physical' reason of all Maxwell's demons failure.
Here we propose a modified Szilard engine which operates without any steps in
the process resembling the creation or destruction of information. We argue
that the information-based exorcisms must be wrong, or at the very least
superfluous, and that the real physical reason why such engines cannot work
lies in the ubiquity of thermal fluctuations (and friction).
  We see in the above peculiar features the main motivation and rationale for
pursuing exploratory research to challenge the second law, which is still
ongoing and probably richer than ever. A quite thorough (and critical)
description of some of these challenges is also given.

(pQCD) evolution. Our goal is to initiate the process of establishing reliable,
QCD-evolved parametrizations for the TMD PDFs and TMD FFs that can be used both
to test TMD-factorization and to search for evidence of the breakdown of
TMD-factorization that is expected for certain processes. In this article, we
focus on spin-independent processes because they provide the simplest
illustration of the basic steps and can already be used in direct tests of
TMD-factorization. Our calculations are based on the Collins-Soper-Sterman
(CSS) formalism, supplemented by recent theoretical developments which have
clarified the precise definitions of the TMD PDFs and TMD FFs needed for a
valid TMD-factorization theorem. Starting with these definitions, we
numerically generate evolved TMD PDFs and TMD FFs using as input existing
parametrizations for the collinear PDFs, collinear FFs, non-perturbative
factors in the CSS factorization formalism, and recent fixed-scale fits. We
confirm that evolution has important consequences, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, and argue that it should be included in future phenomenological
studies of TMD functions. Our analysis is also suggestive of extensions to
processes that involve spin-dependent functions such as the Boer-Mulders,
Sivers, or Collins functions, which we intend to pursue in future publications.
At our website we have made available the tables and calculations needed to
obtain the TMD parametrizations presented herein.

although there exist regions of the multiplication factor where the existence
of an ""optimal"" number of removed links for deterioration of cooperation can
also be demonstrated. The findings are explained by means of wealth
distributions and analytical approximations, confirming that socially diverse

constructs on the nature of the observable. The secondary intention is the
development of appropriate methods consonant with experimental definitions. By
focusing on gradients, it is possible to determine both the average and
instantaneous rate constants that can monitor changes in the rate constant with
concentration changes as suggested by this theory. Here, methods are developed
and discussed utilizing nonlinear analysis which does not require exact
knowledge of initial concentrations. These methods are compared with those
derived from standard methodology. These gradient methods are shown to be
consistent with the ones from standard methods and could readily serve as
alternatives for studies where there are limits or unknowns in the initial
conditions, such as in the burgeoning fields of astrophysics and
astrochemistry, forensics, archeology and biology . All four reactions studied
exhibited semi sinusoidal-like change with reactant concentration change which
standard methods cannot detect, which seems to constitute the observation of a
new effect that is not predicted by current formulations, where the possibility
that the observations are due to artifacts from instrumental errors or the
optimization method is reasoned as unlikely since the experiments were
conducted by different groups at very different times with different classes of
reactions.

this catastrophic rupture was estimated at $\rm 4.10^6$ cubic meters and is the
largest ever observed ice fall event in the Alps. The causes of this collapse
are however not entirely clear. Based on previous studies, we reanalyzed this
break-off event, with the help of a new numerical model, initially developed by
Faillettaz and others (2010) for gravity-driven instabilities. The simulations
indicate that a break-off event is only possible when the basal friction at the
bedrock is reduced in a restricted area, possibly induced by the storage of
infiltrated water within the glacier. Moreover, our simulations reveal a
two-step behavior: (i) A first quiescent phase, without visible changes, with a
duration depending on the rate of basal changes; (ii) An active phase with a
rapid increase of basal motion over a few days. The general lesson obtained
from the comparison between the simulations and the available evidence is that
visible signs of the destabilization process of a hanging glacier, resulting
from a progressive warming of the ice/bed interface towards a temperate regime,
will appear just a few days prior to the collapse.

At C = 0.35%, however, bacteria migrate as broad circular bands rather than
sharp rings. These are growth/diffusion waves arising because of suppression of
chemotaxis by the agar and have not been previously reported experimentally to
our knowledge. For C = 0.4-0.5%, expanding colonies do not span the depth of
the agar and develop pronounced front instabilities. The migration front speed
is weakly dependent on agar concentration at C < 0.25%, but decreases sharply
above this value. We discuss these observations in terms of an extended
Keller-Segel model for which we derived novel transport parameter expressions
accounting for perturbations of the chemotactic response by collisions with the
agar. The model makes it possible to fit the observed front speed decay in the
range C = 0.15-0.35%, and its solutions qualitatively reproduce the observed
transition from chemotactic to growth/diffusion bands. We discuss the

time-evolution of the wavefunction to be calculated explicitly in a limited
region of space, the region of physical interest, the embedding potential
ensuring that the wavefunction satisfies the correct boundary conditions for
matching on to the rest of the system. This is applied to a study of the
excitation of electrons at a metal surface, represented by a one-dimensional
model potential for Cu(111). Time-dependent embedding potentials are derived
for replacing the bulk substrate, and the image potential and vacuum region
outside the surface, so that the calculation of electron excitation by a
surface perturbation can be restricted to the surface itself. The excitation of
the Shockley surface state and a continuum bulk state is studied, and the
time-structure of the resulting currents analysed. Non-linear effects and the
time taken for the current to arrive outside the surface are discussed. The
method shows a clear distinction between emission from the localized surface
state, where the charge is steadily depleted, and the extended continuum state
where the current emitted into the vacuum is compensated by current approaching

temperatures and transverse fields. An expression with one constant $\pi$, that
determines both the critical exponent $\gamma$ and the critical transverse
field, compellingly represents the data asymptotically near the quantum
critical point, except for a narrow classical region close to the phase
transition line, and shows two crossovers as temperature varies.

Landau-gauge case, while preserving all the properties of the continuum
formulation. The only remaining difficulty with our approach is that, using the
standard (compact) discretization, the gluon field is bounded, while its
four-divergence satisfies a Gaussian distribution, i.e. it is unbounded. This
can give rise to convergence problems when a numerical implementation is
attempted. In order to overcome this problem, one can use different
discretizations for the gluon field, or consider an SU(N_c) group with
sufficiently large N_c. Here we discuss these two possible solutions.

ad hoc wireless network (e.g., students in a campus). Many smartphones are GPS
enabled, and equipped with peer-to-peer (ad hoc) transmission mode, allowing
them to wirelessly exchange files over short distances rather than use the
carrier's WAN. The demand for the file however is transmitted through the
social network (e.g., a YouTube link posted on Facebook).
  To address this coupled-network problem (demand on the social network;
bandwidth on the wireless network) where the two networks have different
topologies, we propose a file dissemination algorithm. In our scheme, users
query their social network to find geographically nearby friends that have the
desired file, and utilize the underlying ad hoc network to route the data via
multi-hop transmissions. We show that for many popular models for social
networks, the file dissemination time scales sublinearly with n; the number of
users, compared to the linear scaling required if each user who wants the file
must download it from the carrier's WAN.

analyzing their stellar kinematics from discrete tracers such as planetary
nebulae. This method involves binning the data in the radial direction so as to
extract the most general possible non-parametric kinematic profiles, and using
a maximum likelihood fit within each bin in order to make full use of the
information in the discrete kinematic tracers. Both disk and spheroid kinematic
components are fitted, with a two-dimensional decomposition of imaging data
used to attribute to each tracer a probability of membership in the separate
components. Likelihood clipping also allows us to identify objects whose
properties are not consistent with the adopted model, rendering the technique
robust against contaminants and able to identify additional kinematic features.
  The method is first tested on an N-body simulated galaxy to assess possible
sources of systematic error associated with the structural and kinematic
decomposition, which are found to be small. It is then applied to the S0 system
NGC~1023, for which a planetary nebula catalogue has already been released and
analyzed by (Noordermeer et al., 2008). The correct inclusion of the spheroidal
component allows us to show that, contrary to previous claims, the stellar
kinematics of this galaxy are indistinguishable from those of a normal spiral
galaxy, indicating that it may have evolved directly from such a system via gas
stripping or secular evolution. The method also successfully identifies a
population of outliers whose kinematics are different from those of the main
galaxy; these objects can be identified with a stellar stream associated with
the companion galaxy NGC~1023A.
