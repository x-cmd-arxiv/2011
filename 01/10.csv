networks in the form of films or scaffolds. The materials have good prospects
for biomedical applications, especially in the context of bone regeneration.
Entropy-elastic gelatin based hydrogel films with varying crosslinking
densities were prepared with tailored mechanical properties. Gelatin was
covalently crosslinked in water above its sol gel transition, which suppressed
the gelatin chain helicity. Amorphous films were prepared with tailorable
degrees of swelling and wet state Young's modulus. The knowledge gained with
this bulk material was transferred to the integrated process of foaming and
crosslinking to obtain porous gelatin-based scaffolds. A gelatin solution was
foamed in the presence of saponin and the resulting foam was fixed by chemical
crosslinking with a diisocyanate. The scaffolds were analyzed in the dry state
by micro computed tomography (\mu CT, porosity: 65\pm 11-73\pm 14 vol.-%), and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, pore size: 117\pm 28-166 \pm 32 \mu m).
After equilibration with water, the scaffolds were form-stable and displayed
shape recovery after removal of mechanical loads. The composition dependent
compression moduli (Ec: 10 50 kPa) were comparable to the bulk micromechanical
Young's moduli, which were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
hydrolytic degradation profile could be adjusted, and a controlled decrease of
mechanical properties was observed. The scaffold cytotoxicity and immunologic
responses were analyzed in vitro. Indirect eluate tests were carried out with
L929 cells so that fully cytocompatible scaffolds were obtained. Furthermore,
the material immune response was investigated in vitro. Minimal material
endotoxin contamination was successfully achieved (<0.5 EU/mL) by using
low-endotoxin gelatin and performing all synthetic steps in cleanroom.

automated and simultaneous use of many versions of form-factors for the
calculation of optional weights for fits was developped and checked to work in
Belle and BaBar software environment. Work on alternative paramterizations of

Landau mixing parameters. The existence of quantized Landau levels for the
charged sector has some impact on the Landau parameters with the presence of
discretized features in those involving the proton sector. Using the Fermi

found that for magnetic field strengths Log$_{10}$ B (G) $\le 17$ the relative

of the phenomenon for periodically driven, weakly interacting two-level

in optical reflection. Specifically, we observe the spatial Goos-H\""anchen
shift in which the beam is displaced parallel to the plane of incidence and the
angular Imbert-Fedorov shift which is a transverse angular deviation from the
geometric optics prediction. Experimental results agree well with our
theoretical predictions. Both beam shifts increase with the OAM of the beam; we
have measured these for OAM indices up to 3. Moreover, the OAM couples these
two shifts. Our results are significant for optical metrology since optical
beams with OAM have been extensively used in both fundamental and applied
research.

show that for such an action there exists a corresponding isometric action on a
dual compact symmetric space, which reflects many properties of the original
action. For example, the principal isotropy subgroups of both actions are
locally isomorphic and the dual action is (hyper)polar if and only if the
original action is (hyper)polar. This fact provides many new examples for polar
actions on symmetric spaces of noncompact type and we use duality as a method
to study polar actions by reductive algebraic subgroups in the isometry group
of an irreducible symmetric space. Among other applications, we show that they
are hyperpolar if the space is of type III and of higher rank; we prove that
such actions are orbit equivalent to Hermann actions if they are hyperpolar and
of cohomogeneity greater than one. Furthermore, we classify polar actions by
reductive algebraic subgroups of the isometry group on noncompact symmetric
spaces of rank one.

among the farthest known astrophysical sources. These features make them
appealing candidates as standard candles for cosmological applications so that
studying the physical mechanisms for the origin of the emission and
correlations among their observable properties is an interesting task. We
consider here the luminosity L*X - break time Ta* (hereafter LT) correlation
and investigate whether there are systematics induced by selection effects or
redshift dependent calibra- tion. We perform this analysis both for the full
sample of 77 GRBs with known redshift and for the subsample of GRBs having
canonical X-ray light curves, hereafter called U0095 sample. We do not find any
systematic bias thus con- firming the existence of physical GRB subclasses
revealed by tight correlations of their afterglow properties. Furthermore, we
study the possibility of applying the LT correlation as a redshift estimator
both for the full distribution and for the canonical lightcurves. The large
uncertainties and the non negligible intrin- sic scatter make the results not
so encouraging, but there are nevertheless some hints motivating a further
analysis with an increased U0095 sample.

multi-wavelength imaging data sets. Using Principle Component Analysis
(hereafter PCA) to associate pixels according to their $ugriz$-band colors,
smoothing is done over pixels with a similar location in PCA space. This method
smoothes over pixels with similar color, which reduces the amount of mixing of
different colors within the smoothing region. The method is tested using a mock
galaxy with signal-to-noise levels and color characteristics of SDSS data. When
comparing this method to smoothing methods using a fixed radial profile or an
adaptive radial profile, the chi^2-like statistic for the method presented here
is smaller. The method shows a small dependence on input parameters. Running
this method on SDSS data and fitting theoretical stellar population models to
the smoothed data of the mock galaxy and SDSS data, shows that the method
reduces scatter in the best-fit stellar population analysis parameters, when
compared to cases where no smoothing is done. For an area centered on the star
forming region of the mock galaxy, the median and standard deviation of the

activity which must be controlled. A token confers the right to engage in the
controlled activity. Processors communicate with neighbors in the ring to
obtain and release a token. The communication mechanism investigated in this
paper is the safe register abstraction, which may arbitrarily corrupt a value
that a processor reads when the operation reading a register is concurrent with
an write operation on that register by a neighboring processor. The main
results are simple protocols for quasi-atomic communication, constructed from
safe registers. A quasi-atomic register behaves atomically except that a
special undefined value may be returned in the case of concurrent read and
write operations. Under certain conditions that constrain the number of writes
and registers, quasi-atomic protocols are adequate substitutes for atomic
protocols. The paper demonstrates how quasi-atomic protocols can be used to
implement a self-stabilizing token ring, either by using two safe registers
between neighboring processors or by using O(lg N) safe registers between
neighbors, which lowers read complexity.

electrical spin injection from a ferromagnetic tunnel contact has been
demonstrated, much of the basic behavior is heavily debated. It is reported
here for semiconductor/Al2O3/ferromagnet tunnel structures based on Si or GaAs
that local magnetostatic fields arising from interface roughness dramatically
alter and even dominate the accumulation and dynamics of spins in the
semiconductor. Spin precession in the inhomogeneous magnetic fields is shown to
reduce the spin accumulation up to tenfold, and causes it to be inhomogeneous
and non-collinear with the injector magnetization. The inverted Hanle effect
serves as experimental signature. This interaction needs to be taken into
account in the analysis of experimental data, particularly in extracting the
spin lifetime and its variation with different parameters (temperature, doping
concentration). It produces a broadening of the standard Hanle curve and
thereby an apparent reduction of the spin lifetime. For heavily doped n-type Si
at room temperature it is shown that the spin lifetime is larger than
previously determined, and a new lower bound of 0.29 ns is obtained. The
results are expected to be general and occur for spins near a magnetic
interface not only in semiconductors but also in metals, organic and
carbon-based materials including graphene, and in various spintronic device
structures.

observed in the SEM images of sintered PbFe12O19 ceramics. Large spontaneous
polarization was observed in PbFe12O19 ceramic at room temperature, exhibiting
a clear ferroelectric hysteresis loop. The remnant polarization of PbFe12O19
ceramic is estimated to be Pr~21{\mu}C/cm2. The distortion of hexahedron grains
as well as the Fe oxygen octahedron in its perovskite-like hexagonal unit cell
is proposed to be the origin of polarization in PbFe12O19 ceramics. Meanwhile,
PbFe12O19 ceramics demonstrate strong ferromagnetism at room temperature.
Simultaneous occurrence of large ferroelectricity and strong ferromagnetism in
PbFe12O19 ceramics holds promise for its application in new generation of
electronic devices as a practical multiferroic candidate in single phase.

over considerable computational time, resulting in difficulties in simulating
equilibrium states. In order to overcome this difficulty, here we propose a
newly devised method, molecular Monte Carlo simulation of systems connected to
three reservoirs: chemical potential, pressure, and temperature. Gibbs-Duhem
equation thermodynamically limits the number of reservoirs to 2 for single
component systems. However, in conventional simulations utilizing 2 or fewer
reservoirs, the system tends to be trapped in metastable states. Even if the
system is allowed to escape from such metastable states in conventional
simulations, the fixed system size and/or the fixed number of particles result
in creation of defects in ordered structures. This situation breaks global
anisotropy of ordered structures and forces the periodicity of the structure to
be commensurate to the system size. Here we connect the such three reservoirs
to overcome these difficulties. A method of adjusting the three reservoirs and
obtaining thermodynamically stable states is also designed, based on
Gibbs-Duhem equation. Unlike the other conventional simulation techniques
utilizing no more than 2 reservoirs, our method allows the system itself to
simultaneously tune the system size and the number of particles to periodicity
and anisotropy of ordered structures. Our method requires fewer efforts for
preliminary simulations prior to production runs, compared with the other
advanced simulation techniques such as multicanonical method. A free energy
measurement method, suitable for the system with the three reservoirs, is also
discussed, based on Euler equation of thermodynamics. This measurement method
needs fewer computational efforts than other free energy measurement methods
do.

development of a method to detect nodes important to communities that is both

we introduce a new approach to characterize the node importance to communities.
First, a centrality metric is proposed to measure the importance of network
nodes to community structure using the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. We
define the node importance to communities as the relative change in the
eigenvalues of the network adjacency matrix upon their removal. Second, we also
propose an index to distinguish two kinds of important nodes in communities,
i.e., ""community core"" and ""bridge"". Our indices are only relied on the
spectrum of the graph matrix. They are applied in many artificial networks as
well as many real-world networks. This new methodology gives us a basic
approach to solve this challenging problem and provides a realistic result.

low enough spacetime dimensions, but when additional divergences appear in
higher dimensions, the traditional approach leads to results, such as
triviality, that are less than satisfactory. Guided by idealized but soluble
{\it non}renormalizable models, a nontraditional proposal for the quantization
of covariant scalar field theories is advanced, which achieves a term-by-term,
divergence-free, perturbation analysis of interacting models expanded about a
suitable pseudofree theory, which differs from a free theory by an O(\hbar^2)
counterterm. These positive features are realized within a functional integral
formulation by a local, nonclassical, counterterm that effectively transforms
parameter changes in the action from generating mutually singular measures,
which are the basis for divergences, to equivalent measures, thereby removing
all divergences. The use of an alternative model about which to perturb is
already supported by properties of the classical theory, and is allowed by the
inherent ambiguity in the quantization process itself. This procedure not only
provides acceptable solutions for models for which no acceptable, faithful
solution currently exists, e.g., \phi^4_n, for spacetime dimensions n\ge4, but
offers a new, divergence-free solution, for less-singular models as well, e.g.,
\phi^4_n, for n=2,3. Our analysis implies similar properties for multicomponent

output. Here, we deviate from this tradition and look instead at the structure
of output embodied in the network connecting countries to the products that
they export.We characterize this network using four structural features: the
negative relationship between the diversification of a country and the average
ubiquity of its exports, and the non-normal distributions for product ubiquity,
country diversification and product co-export. We model the structure of the
network by assuming that products require a large number of non-tradable
inputs, or capabilities, and that countries differ in the completeness of the
set of capabilities they have. We solve the model assuming that the probability
that a country has a capability and that a product requires a capability are
constant and calibrate it to the data to find that it accounts well for all of
the network features except for the heterogeneity in the distribution of
country diversification. In the light of the model, this is evidence of a large
heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities across countries. Finally, we
show that the model implies that the increase in diversification that is
expected from the accumulation of a small number of capabilities is small for
countries that have a few of them and large for those with many. This implies
that the forces that help drive divergence in product diversity increase with
the complexity of the global economy when capabilities travel poorly.

approach first pioneered by Matthaeus et al. (1982, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1256)
by which, under the assumption of spatial homogeneity, one can use Fourier
transforms of the magnetic field time series to construct one-dimensional
spectra of the magnetic energy and magnetic helicity under the assumption that
the Taylor frozen-in-flow hypothesis is valid. That is a well-satisfied
assumption for the data used in this study. The magnetic helicity derives from
the skew-symmetric terms of the three-dimensional magnetic correlation tensor,
while the symmetric terms of the tensor are used to determine the magnetic
energy spectrum. Our results show a sign change of magnetic helicity at
wavenumber k~2 AU^{-1} (or frequency nu~2 uHz) at distances below 2.8 AU and at
k~30 AU^{-1} (or nu~25 uHz) at larger distances. At small scales the magnetic
helicity is positive at northern heliographic latitudes and negative at
southern latitudes. The positive magnetic helicity at small scales is argued to
be the result of turbulent diffusion reversing the sign relative to what is
seen at small scales at the solar surface. Furthermore, the magnetic helicity
declines toward solar minimum in 1996. The magnetic helicity flux integrated
separately over one hemisphere amounts to about 10^{45} Mx^2/cycle at large

many known combinatorial optimization problems, and assuming the unique games
conjecture, semidefinite programming techniques give optimal approximation
algorithms. We extend this body of work by initiating the study of Quadratic
Programming problems where the variables take values in the domain {-1,0,1}.
The specific problems we study are
  QP-Ratio : \max_{\{-1,0,1\}^n} \frac{\sum_{i \not = j} a_{ij} x_i x_j}{\sum
x_i^2}, and Normalized QP-Ratio : \max_{\{-1,0,1\}^n} \frac{\sum_{i \not = j}

for special cases. As with other problems with ratio objectives (e.g. uniform

with parity [EGOE(1+2)-$\pi$] generated by a random two-body interaction
(modeled by GOE in two particle spaces) in the presence of a mean-field, for
spinless identical fermion systems, is defined, generalizing the two-body
ensemble with parity analyzed by Papenbrock and Weidenm\""{u}ller [Phys. Rev. C
{\bf 78}, 054305 (2008)], in terms of two mixing parameters and a gap between
the positive $(\pi=+)$ and negative $(\pi=-)$ parity single particle (sp)
states. Numerical calculations are used to demonstrate, using realistic values
of the mixing parameters appropriate for some nuclei, that the EGOE(1+2)-$\pi$
ensemble generates Gaussian form (with corrections) for fixed parity eigenvalue
densities (i.e. state densities). The random matrix model also generates many
features in parity ratios of state densities that are similar to those
predicted by a method based on the Fermi-gas model for nuclei. We have also
obtained, by applying the formulation due to Chang et al [Ann. Phys. (N.Y.)
{\bf 66}, 137 (1971)], a simple formula for the spectral variances defined over
fixed-$(m_1,m_2)$ spaces, where $m_1$ is the number of fermions in the +ve
parity sp states and $m_2$ is the number of fermions in the -ve parity sp
states. Similarly, using the binary correlation approximation, in the dilute
limit, we have derived expressions for the lowest two shape parameters. The
smoothed densities generated by the sum of fixed-$(m_1,m_2)$ Gaussians with
lowest two shape corrections describe the numerical results in many situations.
The model also generates preponderance of +ve parity ground states for small
values of the mixing parameters and this is a feature seen in nuclear shell
model results.

Realistic helium-helium potentials present an extremely strong short-range

cancellation between kinetic and potential energy. We analyze the possibility
of describing the three helium system in the ultracold regime using a gaussian

However, in order to describe correctly the trimer ground state a three-body
force has to be added to the gaussian interaction. With this potential model
the two bound states of the trimer and the low energy scattering helium-dimer
phase shifts obtained with the LM2M2 potential are well reproduced.

in massive stars with near-critical rotation induced by evolution of the
stellar interior. In contrast to the usual stellar wind mass loss set by
exterior driving from the stellar luminosity, such decretion-disk mass loss
stems from the angular momentum loss needed to keep the star near and below
critical rotation, given the interior evolution and decline in the star's
moment of inertia. Because the specific angular momentum in a Keplerian disk
increases with the square root of the radius, the decretion mass loss
associated with a required level of angular momentum loss depends crucially on
the outer radius for viscous coupling of the disk, and can be significantly
less than the spherical mass loss the spherical, wind-like mass loss commonly
assumed in evolutionary calculations. We discuss the physical processes that
affect the outer disk radius, including thermal disk outflow, and ablation of
the disk material via a line-driven wind induced by the star's radiation. We
present parameterized scaling laws for taking account of decretion-disk mass
loss in stellar evolution codes, including how these are affected by
metallicity, or by presence within a close binary and/or a dense cluster.
Effects similar to those discussed here should also be present in accretion
disks during star formation, and may play an important role in shaping the
distribution of rotation speeds on the ZAMS.

variability classes. Transitions from one class to another could take place in
a matter of hours. In some of the classes, the spectral state transitions
(burst-off to burst-on and vice versa) were found to take place in a matter of
few to few tens of seconds. In the literature, there is no attempt to
understand in which order these classes were exhibited. Since the observation
was not continuous, the appearances of these classes seem to be in random
order. Our goal is to find a natural sequence of these classes and compare with
the existing observations. We also wish to present a physical interpretation of
the sequence so obtained using two component advective flow model of black hole
accretion. In the present paper, we compute the ratios of the power-law photons
and the black body photons in the spectrum of each class and call these ratios
as the `Comptonizing efficiency'(CE). We sequence the classes from the low to
the high value of CE. We clearly find that each variability class could be
characterized by a unique average Comptonizing efficiency. The sequence of the
classes based on this parameter seem to be corroborated by a handful of the
observed transitions caught by Rossi X-ray timing explorer and the Indian
payload Indian X-ray Astronomy Experiment and we believe that future
observation of the object would show that the transitions can only take place
between consecutive classes in this sequence. Since the power-law photons are
produced by inverse Comptonization of the intercepted soft-photons from the
Keplerian disk, a change in CE actually corresponds to a change in geometry of
the compton cloud. Thus we claim that the size of the Compton cloud gradually
rises from very soft class to the very hard class.

Hamaker et al. has provided us with an elegant mathematical apparatus for
better understanding, simulation and calibration of existing and future
instruments. The calibration of the new radio telescopes (LOFAR, SKA) would be
unthinkable without the RIME formalism, and new software to exploit it.
MeqTrees is designed to implement numerical models such as the RIME, and to
solve for arbitrary subsets of their parameters. The technical goal of MeqTrees
is to provide a tool for rapid implementation of such models, while offering
performance comparable to hand-written code. We are also pursuing the wider
goal of increasing the rate of evolution of radio astronomical software, by
offering a tool for rapid experimentation and exchange of ideas.
  MeqTrees is implemented as a Python-based front-end called the meqbrowser,
and an efficient (C++-based) computational back-end called the meqserver.
Numerical models are defined on the front-end via a Python-based Tree
Definition Language (TDL), then rapidly executed on the back-end. The use of
TDL facilitates an extremely short turn-around time for experimentation with
new ideas. This is also helped by unprecedented visualization capabilities for
all final and intermediate results. A flexible data model and a number of
important optimizations in the back-end ensures that the numerical performance
is comparable to that of hand-written code.
  MeqTrees is already widely used as the simulation tool for new instruments
(LOFAR, SKA) and technologies (focal plane arrays). It has demonstrated that it
can achieve a noise-limited dynamic range in excess of a million, on WSRT data.
It is the only package that is specifically designed to handle what we propose
to call third-generation calibration (3GC), which is needed for the new
generation of giant radio telescopes.

for convenience the conformal time $\eta$ is set to be zero at the end of

the divergence of NADE. To avoid the difficulty, we can redefine the conformal
time as $\eta+\delta$. However, we find that the positive constant $\delta$
must be so large that NADE can not become dominated at present time.

star-forming regions, but it has also been detected in extragalactic
environments. Aims. To present the first extragalactic survey of HC3N, when
combining earlier data from the literature with six new single-dish detections,
and to compare HC3N with other molecular tracers (HCN, HNC), as well as other
properties (silicate absorption strength, IR flux density ratios, C II flux,
and megamaser activity). Methods. We present mm IRAM 30 m, OSO 20 m, and SEST
observations of HC3N rotational lines (mainly the J = 10-9 transition) and of
the J = 1-0 transitions of HCN and HNC. Our combined HC3N data account for 13
galaxies (excluding the upper limits reported for the non-detections), while we
have HCN and HNC data for more than 20 galaxies. Results. A preliminary
definition ""HC3N-luminous galaxy"" is made based upon the HC3N/HCN ratio. Most
(~80 %) HC3N-luminous galaxies seem to be deeply obscured galaxies and
(U)LIRGs. A majority (~60 % or more) of the HC3N-luminous galaxies in the
sample present OH mega- or strong kilomaser activity. A possible explanation is
that both HC3N and OH megamasers need warm dust for their excitation.
Alternatively, the dust that excites the OH megamaser offers protection against
UV destruction of HC3N. A high silicate absorption strength is also found in
several of the HC3N-luminous objects, which may help the HC3N to survive.
Finally, we find that a high HC3N/HCN ratio is related to a high dust
temperature and a low C II flux.

for the first time the O-rich nature of IRAS 17423-1755 in contradiction to a
previous C-rich classification, which was based on the wrong identification of
the strong 3.1 um absorption feature seen in the Infrared Space Observatory

spectrum displays a complete lack of C-rich mid-IR features such as molecular
absorption features (e.g., 13.7 um C2H2, 14.0 um HCN, etc.) or the classical
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon infrared emission bands. Thus, the strong 3.1
um absorption band toward IRAS 17423-1755 has to be identified as water ice. In
addition, a [Ne II] nebular emission line at 12.8 um is clearly detected,
indicating that the ionization of its central region may be already started.

measurement equation (RIME) formalism to the full-sky case, and provided a
RIME-based description of calibration and the problem of direction-dependent
effects (DDEs). This paper aims to provide a practical demonstration of a
RIME-based approach to calibration, via an example of extremely high-dynamic
range calibration of WSRT observations of 3C 147 at 21 cm, with full treatment
of DDEs.
  A version of the RIME incorporating differential gains has been implemented
in MeqTrees, and applied to the 3C 147 data. This was used to perform regular
selfcal, then solve for interferometer-based errors and for differential gains.
The resulting image of the field around 3C 147 is thermal noise-limited, has a
very high dynamic range (1.6 million), and none of the off-axis artefacts that
plague regular selfcal. The differential gain solutions show a high
signal-to-noise ratio, and may be used to extract information on DDEs and
errors in the sky model.
  The differential gain approach can eliminate DDE-related artefacts, and
provide information for iterative improvements of sky models. Perhaps most
importantly, sources as faint as 2 mJy have been shown to yield meaningful
differential gain solutions, and thus can be used as potential calibration
beacons in other DDE-related schemes.

instrumentation at wavelengths from the ultraviolet (GALEX), via optical (HST

providing much new information about disk galaxies over a wide range of
redshift. Although progress has been made, the dynamics and structure of
stellar disks, including their truncations, are still not well understood. We
do now have plausible estimates of disk mass-to-light ratios, and estimates of
Toomre's $Q$ parameter show that they are just locally stable. Disks are mostly
very flat and sometimes very thin, and have a range in surface brightness from
canonical disks with a central surface brightness of about 21.5 $B$-mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ down to very low surface brightnesses. It appears that galaxy
disks are not maximal, except possibly in the largest systems. Their HI layers
display warps whenever HI can be detected beyond the stellar disk, with
low-level star formation going on out to large radii. Stellar disks display
abundance gradients which flatten at larger radii and sometimes even reverse.
The existence of a well-defined baryonic Tully-Fisher relation hints at an
approximately uniform baryonic to dark matter ratio. Thick disks are common in
disk galaxies and their existence appears unrelated to the presence of a bulge
component; they are old, but their formation is not yet understood. Disk
formation was already advanced at redshifts of $\sim 2$, but at that epoch
disks were not yet quiescent and in full rotational equilibrium. Downsizing is
now well-established. The formation and history of star formation in S0s is
still not fully understood.

in the behavior of the given function, adjusts the approximant depending on it,

constructing optimal approximating spline for each function proved to be very
hard. In fact, no polynomial time algorithm of adaptive spline approximation
can be designed and no exact formula for the optimal error of approximation can
be given. Therefore, the next natural question would be to study the asymptotic

host silicate oblate spheroid and inclusions of ice/graphite/or voids, in the
spectral region 5.0-25.0$\mu m$. The absorption efficiencies of the composite
spheroidal oblate grains for three axial ratios are computed using the discrete
dipole approximation (DDA). We study the absorption as a function of the volume
fraction of the inclusions and porosity. In particular, we study the variation
in the $10\mu m$ and $18\mu m$ emission features with the volume fraction of
the inclusions and porosities. We then calculate the infrared fluxes for these
composite grains at several dust temperatures (T=200-350K) and compare the
model curves with the average observed IRAS-LRS curve, obtained for
circumstellar dust shells around oxygen rich M-type stars. The model curves are
also compared with two other individual stars.

feature at 10$\mu m$ shifts with the volume fraction of graphite inclusions.
The feature does not shift with the porosity. Both the features do not show any
broadening with the inclusions or porosity. The absorption efficiencies of the
composite grains calculated using DDA and Effective Medium Approximation (EMA)
do not agree. The composite grain models presented in this study need to be

made amenable to future extensions to parallel computer simulations. The add-on
QCWAVE extends QDENSITY in several ways. The first way is to describe the
action of one, two and three- qubit quantum gates as a set of small ($2 \times
2, 4\times 4$ or $8\times 8$) matrices acting on the $2^{n_q}$ amplitudes for a
system of $n_q$ qubits. This procedure was described in our parallel computer
simulation QCMPI and is reviewed here. The advantage is that smaller storage
demands are made, without loss of speed, and that the procedure can take
advantage of message passing interface (MPI) techniques, which will hopefully
be generally available in future Mathematica versions.
  Another extension of QDENSITY provided here is a multiverse approach, as
described in our QCMPI paper. This multiverse approach involves using the
present slave-master parallel processing capabilities of Mathematica 7.0/8.0 to
simulate errors and error correction. The basic idea is that parallel versions
of QCWAVE run simultaneously with random errors introduced on some of the
processors, with an ensemble average used to represent the real world
situation. Within this approach, error correction steps can be simulated and
their efficacy tested. This capability allows one to examine the detrimental
effects of errors and the benefits of error correction on particular quantum
algorithms.

discovered a new spectroscopic class of powerful radio-loud AGN. The defining
characteristics of these galaxies are that compared with radio galaxies of
similar radio luminosity they have: a [O III]\Hb ratio of ~0.5, indicative of
an extremely low level of gas excitation; a large deficit of [O III] emission
and radio core power. We interpret these objects as relic AGN, i.e. sources
that experienced a large drop in their level of nuclear activity, causing a
decrease in their nuclear and line luminosity. This class opens a novel
approach to investigating lifetimes and duty cycles of AGN.

the SD were calculated using restricted or unrestricted Hartree-Fock or density
functional theory (DFT) calculations where five commonly-used local (SVWN5),
semi-local (PW91PW91 and BLYP), and hybrid (B1LYP and B3LYP) functionals were

generalized valence bond, and unrestricted configuration interaction methods.
We also adopted the UB3LYP-MOs to construct the MD expansion (UB3LYP-MD) and
optimized their coefficients at the VMC level. In addition to the wavefunction
dependence, we investigated the time-step bias in the DMC calculation and the
effects of pseudopotentials and backflow transformation for the UB3LYP-SD case.
Some of the VMC binding curves show a flat or quite shallow well bottom, which
gets recovered deeper by DMC. All the DMC binding curves have a minimum
indicating a bound state, but the comparison of atomic and molecular energies
gives rise to a negative binding energy for all the DMC as well as VMC

(M_BH ~ 1.7*10^6 M_sun) based on a series of XMM-Newton observations taken in
2009 with a total exposure of ~570 ks (EPIC pn). These data reveal the form of
the power spectrum over frequencies from 10^-4 Hz, below the previously
detected power spectral break, to > 10^-2 Hz, above the frequency of the
innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole (nu_ISCO ~ 10^-3 -
10^-2 Hz, depending on the black hole spin parameter j). This is equivalent to
probing frequencies >1 kHz in a stellar mass (M_BH ~ 10 Msun) black hole binary
system. The power spectrum is a featureless power law over the region of the
expected ISCO frequency, suggesting no strong enhancement or change in the
variability at the fastest orbital period in the system. Despite the huge
amplitude of the flux variations between the observations (peak-to-peak factor
of >50) the power spectrum appears to be stationary in shape, and varies in
amplitude at all observed frequencies following the previously established
linear rms-flux relation. The rms-flux relation is offset in flux by a small
and energy-dependent amount. The simplest interpretation of the offset is in
terms of a very soft spectral component that is practically constant (compared
to the primary source of variability). One possible origin for this emission is
a circumnuclear shock energised by a radiatively driven outflow from the
central regions, and emitting via inverse-Compton scattering of the central
engine's optical-UV continuum (as inferred from a separate analysis of the
energy spectrum). A comparison with the power spectrum of a long XMM-Newton
observation taken in 2001 gives only weak evidence for non-stationarity in
power spectral shape or amplitude. [Abridged]

for the two-dimensional magnetic Schroedinger operator and the method of
self-similar variables and weighted Sobolev spaces for the heat equation. A
careful analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the heat equation in the
similarity variables shows that the magnetic field asymptotically degenerates
to an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field with the same total magnetic flux, which
leads asymptotically to the gain on the polynomial decay rate in the original
physical variables. Since no assumptions about the symmetry of the magnetic
field are made in the present work, it confirms that the recent results of

bands in the correct orientation for any source orientation. We also report the

field-induced magnetic-ordering transition are weakly coupled to one another

states can be interpreted as phase coherent Bose-Einstein condensates of
magnetic bosonic quasiparticles, one expects the occurrence of Josephson
effects. For two identical systems, the resulting d.c. Josephson effect
formally represents a constant quasiparticle Josephson current across the weak
link, which turns out to be unobservable in an experiment. For magnetic
insulators with different critical fields, a spontaneous alternating
quasiparticle current develops with a leading oscillation frequency
{\omega}a.c. that is determined by the difference between the critical fields.
As a result of the coupling, additional sidebands appear in the energy spectrum
of the coupled device that would be absent without phase coherence. We discuss
the primary conditions for such an effect to take place and conclude that its
detection can be feasible for a proper choice of compounds with suitable and
realistic material parameters.

the majority of stars born are a members of binaries. There is growing evidence
that planets might form in circumprimary disks of medium-separation binaries.
The tidal forces caused by the secondary generally act to distort the
originally circular disk to an eccentric one. To infer the disk eccentricity
from high-res NIR spectroscopy, we calculate the fundamental band emission
lines of the CO molecule emerging from the atmosphere of the disk. We model
circumprimary disk evolution under the gravitational perturbation of the
orbiting secondary using a 2D grid-based hydrodynamical code, assuming
alpha-type viscosity. The hydrodynamical results are combined with our spectral
code based on the double-layer disk model to calculate the CO molecular line
profiles. We find that the orbital velocity distribution of the gas parcels
differs significantly from the circular Keplerian fashion, thus the line
profiles are asymmetric in shape. The magnitude of asymmetry is insensitive to
the binary mass ratio, the magnitude of viscosity, and the disk mass. In
contrast, the disk eccentricity, thus the level of the line profile asymmetry,
is influenced significantly by the binary eccentricity and the disk geometrical
thickness. We demonstrate that the disk eccentricity profile in the
planet-forming region can be determined by fitting the high-resolution CO line
profile asymmetry using a simple 2D spectral model that accounts for the
velocity distortions caused by the disk eccentricity. Thus, with our novel
approach the disk eccentricity can be inferred with high-resolution near-IR
spectroscopy prior to the era of high angular resolution optical or radio
direct-imaging. By determining the disk eccentricity in medium-separation young
binaries, we might be able to constrain the planet formation theories.

relaxation-driven evolution of the cluster, at least outside the core. He
provided two self-similar solutions for the evolution of clusters based on the
view that the cluster as a whole determines the amount of energy that is
produced in the core: steady expansion for isolated clusters, and homologous
contraction for clusters evaporating in a tidal field. We combine these models:
the half-mass radius increases during the first half of the evolution, and
decreases in the second half; while the escape rate approaches a constant value
set by the tidal field. We refer to these phases as `expansion dominated' and
`evaporation dominated'. These simple analytical solutions immediately allow us
to construct evolutionary tracks and isochrones in terms of cluster half-mass
density, cluster mass and galacto-centric radius. From a comparison to the
Milky Way globular clusters we find that roughly 1/3 of them are in the second,
evaporation-dominated phase and for these clusters the density inside the
half-mass radius varies with the galactocentric distance R as rho_h ~ 1/R^2.
The remaining 2/3 are still in the first, expansion-dominated phase and their
isochrones follow the environment-independent scaling rho_h ~ M^2; that is, a
constant relaxation time-scale. We find substantial agreement between Milky Way
globular cluster parameters and the isochrones, which suggests that there is,
as Henon suggested, a balance between the flow of energy and the central energy
production for almost all globular clusters.

for the derivation of the bubble functions to enrich the standard linear finite
elements employed in the formulation of Galerkin weighted-residual statements.
The element-level linear shape functions are enhanced with supplementary
polynomial bubble functions with undetermined coefficients. The best least
squares minimization of the residual functional obtained from the insertion of
these trial functions into model equations results in an algebraic system of
equations whose solution provides the unknown coefficients in terms of
element-level nodal values. The normal finite element procedures for the
construction of stiffness matrices may then be followed with no extra degree of
freedom incurred as a result of such enrichment. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on a number of benchmark linear transport
equations with the results compared against the exact and standard linear
element solutions. It has been observed that low order bubble enriched elements
produce more accurate approximations than the standard linear elements with no
extra computational cost despite employing relatively crude mesh. However, for
the solution of strongly convection or reaction dominated problems
significantly higher order enrichments as well as extra mesh refinements will
be required.

Kraichnan-like diffusion setup (which is suggested by B/C and $\bar{p}$ data)
gives a satisfactory fit of all exisiting measurements. We confirm that nearby
pulsars are good source candidates for the required $e^\pm$ extra-component and

effective power of repulsion between two dipole particles at height $h$ near
the homeotropic wall is reduced gradually from inverse 3 to 5 with an increase
of dimensionless distance $r/h$; near the planar wall - the effect of
dipole-dipole \textit{isotropic attraction} is predicted for large distances
$r>r_{dd}=4.76 h$; maps of attraction and repulsion zones are crucially changed

distance $\delta_{eq}$ from the center of the cell \textit{independent} of the

action may differ substantially in their time dependence. Cyclic field
variations, characteristic for the solar magnetic field, are often explained by
an important omega-effect, i.e. by the stretching of field lines due to strong
differential rotation. Aims: The dynamo mechanism of a convective, oscillatory
dynamo model is investigated. Methods: We solve the MHD-equations for a
conducting Boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell. For a resulting
oscillatory model, dynamo coefficients have been computed with the help of the
so-called test-field method. Subsequently, these coefficients have been used in
a mean-field calculation in order to explore the underlying dynamo mechanism.
Results: Although the rather strong differential rotation present in this model
influences the magnetic field, the omega-effect alone is not responsible for
its cyclic time variation. If the omega-effect is suppressed, the resulting
alpha^2-dynamo remains oscillatory. Surprisingly, the corresponding alpha-omega
dynamo leads to a non-oscillatory magnetic field. Conclusions: The assumption
of an alpha-omega mechanism does not explain the occurrence of magnetic cycles
satisfactorily.

the W1p norm and we consider Lagrange finite elements of arbitrary polynomial
order m-1. We establish sharp asymptotic error estimates as N tends to infinity

studied earlier, but with the error measured in the Lp norm. The extension of
this analysis to the W1p norm is crucial in order to match more closely the
needs of numerical PDE analysis, and it is not straightforward. In particular,
the meshes which satisfy the optimal error estimate are characterized by a
metric describing the local aspect ratio of each triangle and by a geometric
constraint on their maximal angle, a second feature that does not appear for
the Lp error norm. Our analysis also provides with practical strategies for
designing meshes such that the interpolation error satisfies the optimal

The method employed extends from that of the previously published paper by
these authors on this topic. We detect temporal variability in the diffuse
X-ray background within a narrow low-energy band and contrast this to a
continuum. The low-energy band was chosen to represent the key indicators of
charge exchange emission and the continuum was expected to be free of SWCX.
Approximately 3.4 % of observations studied are affected. We discuss our
results with reference to the XMM-Newton mission. We further investigate
remarkable cases by considering the state of the solar wind and the orientation
of XMM-Newton at the time of these observations. We present a method to
approximate the expected emission from observations, based on given solar wind
parameters taken from an upstream solar wind monitor. We also compare the
incidence of SWCX cases with solar activity. We present a comprehensive study
of the majority of the suitable and publically available XMM-Newton Science
Archive to date, with respect to the occurrence of SWCX enhancements. We
present our SWCX-affected subset of this dataset. The mean exospheric-SWCX flux
observed within this SWCX-affected subset was 15.4 keV cm-2 s-1 sr-1 in the
energy band 0.25 to 2.5 keV. Exospheric SWCX is preferentially detected when
XMM-Newton observes through the subsolar region of the Earth's magnetosheath.

factor of a few of the observed values in the majority of cases, with a mean
value at 83 %.

  Society Main Journal, 2010 January 5; 18 pages; 15 figures",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18300.x",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  (ABRIDGED) We present an analysis of NGC588 based on IFS data with PMAS,
together with Spitzer images at 8 mi and 24 mi. The extinction distribution in
the optical shows complex structure, with maxima correlating in position with
those of the emission at 24 mi and 8 mi. The Ha luminosity absorbed by the dust
within the GHIIR reproduces the structure observed in the 24 mi image,
supporting the use of this band as a tracer of recent star formation. A
velocity difference of ~50 km/s was measured between the areas of high and low
surface brightness, which would be expected if NGC588 were an evolved GHIIR.
Line ratios used in the BPT diagnostic diagrams show a larger range of
variation in the low surface brightness areas. The ranges are ~0.5 to 1.2 dex
for [NII]/Ha, 0.7 to 1.7 dex for [SII]/Ha, and 0.3 to 0.5 dex for [OIII]/Hb.
Ratios corresponding to large ionization parameter (U) are found between the
peak of the emission in Hb and the main ionizing source decreasing radially
outwards within the region. Differences between the integrated and local values
of the U tracers can be as high as ~0.8 dex. [OII]/Hb and [OIII]/[OII] yield
similar local values for U and consistent with those expected from the
integrated spectrum of an HII region ionized by a single star. The ratio
[SII]/Ha departs significantly from the range predicted by this scenario,
indicating the complex ionization structure in GHIIRs. There is a significant
scatter in derivations of Z using strong line tracers as a function of
position, caused by variations in the degree of ionization. The scatter is
smaller for N2O3 which points to this tracer as a better Z tracer than N2. The
comparison between integrated and local line ratio values indicates that
measurements of the line ratios of GHIIR in galaxies at distances >~25 Mpc may
be dominated by the ionization conditions in their low surface brightness
areas.

  Relaying","15 pages, 4 figures, Technical Report",,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate an opportunistic relaying scheme where the
selected relay assists the source-destination (direct) communication. In our
study, we consider a regenerative opportunistic relaying scheme in which the
direct path can be considered unusable, and takes into account the effect of
the possible erroneously detected and transmitted data at the best relay. We
first derive statistics based on exact probability density function (PDF) of
each hop. Then, the PDFs are used to determine accurate closed form expressions
for end-to-end bit-error rate (BER) of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)
modulation. Furthermore, we evaluate the asymptotical performance analysis and
the diversity order is deduced. Finally, we validate our analysis by showing
that performance simulation results coincide with our analytical results over
different network architectures.
