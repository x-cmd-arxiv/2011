interaction through a selective two-qubit gate operation. Atoms are trapped by
a lattice of near field Fresnel diffraction lights so that each trap captures a
single atom. One-qubit gate operation is implemented by a gate control laser
beam which is applied to an individual atom. Two-qubit gate operation between
an arbitrary pair of atoms is implemented by sending these atoms to a
state-dependent optical lattice and making them collide so that a particular
two-qubit state acquires a dynamical phase. We give numerical evaluations
corresponding to these processes, from which we estimate the upper bound of a
two-qubit gate operation time and corresponding gate fidelity. Our proposal is
feasible within currently available technology developed in cold atom gas,
MEMS, nanolithography, and various areas in optics.

percentage of white dwarfs, as the polluted atmospheres of DAZ and DBZ white
dwarfs indicate the very recent accretion of metal-rich material. (Zuckerman et
al. 2010). Some of these polluted white dwarfs are found to have large
mid-infrared excesses from close-in debris disks that are thought to be
reservoirs for the metal accretion. These systems are coined DAZd white dwarfs
(von Hippel et al. 2007). Here we investigate the claims of Bonnet-Bidaud &
Pantin (2008) that Sirius B, the nearest white dwarf to the Sun, might have an
infrared excess from a dusty debris disk. Sirius B's companion, Sirius A is
commonly observed as a mid-infrared photometric standard in the Southern
hemisphere. We combine several years of Gemini/T-ReCS photometric standard
observations to produce deep mid-infrared imaging in five ~10 micron filters
(broad N + 4 narrowband), which reveal the presence of Sirius B. Our photometry
is consistent with the expected photospheric emission such that we constrain
any mid-infrared excess to <10% of the photosphere. Thus we conclude that
Sirius B does not have a large dusty disk, as seen in DAZd white dwarfs.

direct generalization of the real median and has nice robustness properties.
The geometric median being defined as the minimizer of a simple convex
functional that is differentiable everywhere when the distribution has no

algorithms are very fast and can deal with large samples. Furthermore they also
can be simply updated when the data arrive sequentially. We state the almost

that the asymptotic distribution of the averaged version of the algorithm is
the same as the classic estimators which are based on the minimization of the
empirical loss function. The performances of our averaged sequential estimator,
both in terms of computation speed and accuracy of the estimations, are
evaluated with a small simulation study. Our approach is also illustrated on a

present new high resolution H-alpha spectroscopy of P Cyg that we combine with

continuum flux variations over a 24 y time span. We show that the emission and
continuum fluxes vary in concert on timescales of 1.6 y and longer, but differ
on shorter timescales. The H-alpha profile shape also varies on the photometric
timescales, and we describe the observed co-variations of the emission peak and
absorption trough properties. We argue that the episodes of photometric and

that are related to variations in wind mass loss rate and outflow speed. We
find evidence of blueward accelerating, Discrete Absorption Components (DACs)
in the absorption trough of the H-alpha profile, and these features have slower
accelerations and longer durations than those observed in other lines. The DAC
strengths also appear to vary on the photometric timescales, and we suggest
that the propagation of the DAC-related wind structures is closely related to
changes in the overall wind mass loss rate and velocity.

  Biometrics",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurately assessing a patient's risk of a given event is essential in making
informed treatment decisions. One approach is to stratify patients into two or
more distinct risk groups with respect to a specific outcome using both
clinical and demographic variables. Outcomes may be categorical or continuous
in nature; important examples in cancer studies might include level of toxicity
or time to recurrence. Recursive partitioning methods are ideal for building
such risk groups. Two such methods are Classification and Regression Trees
(CART) and a more recent competitor known as the partitioning
Deletion/Substitution/Addition (partDSA) algorithm, both which also utilize
loss functions (e.g. squared error for a continuous outcome) as the basis for
building, selecting and assessing predictors but differ in the manner by which
regression trees are constructed.
  Recently, we have shown that partDSA often outperforms CART in so-called
""full data"" (e.g., uncensored) settings. However, when confronted with censored
outcome data, the loss functions used by both procedures must be modified.
There have been several attempts to adapt CART for right-censored data. This
article describes two such extensions for \emph{partDSA} that make use of
observed data (i.e. possibly censored) loss functions. These observed data loss
functions, constructed using inverse probability of censoring weights, are
consistent estimates of their uncensored counterparts provided that the
corresponding censoring model is correctly specified. The relative performance
of these new methods is evaluated via simulation studies and illustrated
through an analysis of clinical trial data on brain cancer patients.

inv, over T. So the well-known fact that maj and inv are equidistributed over
the symmetric group, S_n, can be expressed by saying that (S_n,S_n) is a
Mahonian pair. We investigate various Mahonian pairs (S,T) with S different
from T. Our principal tool is Foata's fundamental bijection f: P^* -> P^* since
it has the property that maj w = inv f(w) for any word w. We consider various
families of words associated with Catalan and Fibonacci numbers. We show that,
when restricted to words in {1,2}^*, f transforms familiar statistics on words
into natural statistics on integer partitions such as the size of the Durfee
square. The Rogers-Ramanujan identities, the Catalan triangle, and various
q-analogues also make an appearance. We generalize the definition of Mahonian

Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) reducing system, based on compressed sensing
at the receiver of a peak-reducing sparse clipper applied to an OFDM signal at
the transmitter. By exploiting the sparsity of the OFDM signal in the time
domain relative to a pre-defined clipping threshold, the method depends on
partially observing the frequency content of extremely simple sparse clippers
to recover the locations, magnitudes, and phases of the clipped coefficients of
the peak-reduced signal. We claim that in the absence of optimization
algorithms at the transmitter that confine the frequency support of clippers to
a predefined set of reserved-tones, no other tone-reservation method can
reliably recover the original OFDM signal with such low complexity.
  Afterwards we focus on designing different clipping signals that can embed a
priori information regarding the support and phase of the peak-reducing signal
to the receiver, followed by modified compressive sensing techniques for
enhanced recovery. This includes data-based weighted {\ell} 1 minimization for
enhanced support recovery and phase-augmention for homogeneous clippers
followed by Bayesian techniques.
  We show that using such techniques for a typical OFDM signal of 256
subcarriers and 20% reserved tones, the PAPR can be reduced by approximately
4.5 dB with a significant increase in capacity compared to a system which uses
all its tones for data transmission and clips to such levels. The design is
hence appealing from both capacity and PAPR reduction aspects.

presentation of individual viewpoints an angle. The agents do not aim at
forming a common viewpoint but, instead, at agreeing about an acceptable common
angle. We analyze separately the process of MN by two agents (\emph{bilateral}

we use game theoretic models to understand how the process develops in both
cases: the models are Bargaining Game for bilateral MN and English Auction for

requiring fewer computation steps than their classical equivalent - for a
family of algorithms. Bob chooses a function and gives to Alice the black box
that computes it. Alice, without knowing Bob's choice, should find a character
of the function (e. g. its period) by computing its value for different
arguments. There is naturally correlation between Bob's choice and the solution
found by Alice. We show that, in quantum algorithms, this correlation becomes
quantum. This highlights an overlooked measurement problem: sharing between two
measurements the determination of correlated (thus redundant) measurement
outcomes. Solving this problem explains the speed-up. All is like Alice, by
reading the solution at the end of the algorithm, contributed to the initial
choice of Bob, for half of it in quantum superposition for all the possible
ways of taking this half. This contribution, back evolved to before running the
algorithm, where Bob's choice is located, becomes Alice knowing in advance half
of this choice. The quantum algorithm is the quantum superposition of all the
possible ways of taking half of Bob's choice and, given the advanced knowledge
of it, classically computing the missing half. This yields a speed-up with
respect to the classical case where, initially, Bob's choice is completely
unknown to Alice.

spin chain regularization, where the boundary conditions now correspond to the
introduction of additional edge states. The exact values of the exponents then
follow from a lengthy algebraic analysis, a reformulation of the spin chain in
terms of crossing and non-crossing loops (represented as a certain subalgebra
of the Brauer algebra), and earlier results on the so-called one- and

from measured data, is the gold standard for verification and benchmarking of
quantum devices. It has been realized in systems with few components, but for
larger systems it becomes infeasible because the number of quantum measurements
and the amount of computation required to process them grows exponentially in
the system size. Here we show that we can do exponentially better than direct
state tomography for a wide range of quantum states, in particular those that
are well approximated by a matrix product state ansatz. We present two schemes
for tomography in 1-D quantum systems and touch on generalizations. One scheme
requires unitary operations on a constant number of subsystems, while the other
requires only local measurements together with more elaborate post-processing.
Both schemes rely only on a linear number of experimental operations and
classical postprocessing that is polynomial in the system size. A further
strength of the methods is that the accuracy of the reconstructed states can be
rigorously certified without any a priori assumptions.

band can be generated through spontaneous four-wave mixing in dispersion shift
fibers. However, photons originated from other nonlinear processes in optical
fibers, such as Raman scattering and self-phase modulation, may contaminate the
photon pairs. It has been proved that photons produced by Raman scattering are
the background noise of photon pairs. Here we show that photons induced by
self-phase modulation of pump pulses are another origin of background noise.
After studying the dependence of self-phase modulation induced photons in
signal and idler bands, we demonstrate that the quantum correlation of photon
pairs can be degraded by the self-phase modulation effect. The investigations
are useful for characterizing and optimizing an all fiber source of photon
pairs.

  spaces",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important aspect of Bayesian model selection is how to deal with huge
model spaces, since exhaustive enumeration of all the models entertained is
unfeasible and inferences have to be based on the very small proportion of
models visited. This is the case for the variable selection problem, with a
moderate to large number of possible explanatory variables being considered in
this paper. We review some of the strategies proposed in the literature and
argue that inferences based on empirical frequencies via Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling of the posterior distribution outperforms recently proposed
searching methods. We give a plausible yet very simple explanation of this
effect, showing that estimators based on frequencies are unbiased. The results
obtained in two illustrative examples provide strong evidence in favor of our
arguments.

of isolating the real roots of a univariate polynomial in $B_{\alpha} \in
L[y]$, where $L=\QQ(\alpha)$ is a simple algebraic extension of the rational
numbers. We consider two approaches for tackling the problem. In the first
approach using resultant computations we perform a reduction to a polynomial
with integer coefficients. We compute separation bounds for the roots, and
using them we deduce that we can isolate the real roots of $B_{\alpha}$ in
$\sOB(N^{10})$, where $N$ is an upper bound on all the quantities (degree and
bitsize) of the input polynomials. In the second approach we isolate the real
roots working directly on the polynomial of the input. We compute improved
separation bounds for real roots and we prove that they are optimal, under mild
assumptions. For isolating the roots we consider a modified Sturm's algorithm,
and a modified version of \func{descartes}' algorithm introduced by Sagraloff.
For the former we prove a complexity bound of $\sOB(N^8)$ and for the latter a
bound of $\sOB(N^{7})$. We implemented the algorithms in \func{C} as part of
the core library of \mathematica and we illustrate their efficiency over
various data sets. Finally, we present complexity results for the general case
of the first approach, where the coefficients belong to multiple extensions.

message sizes. We use algebraic gossip to disseminate $k$ distinct messages to
all $n$ nodes in a network. For arbitrary networks we provide a new upper bound
for uniform algebraic gossip of $O((k+\log n + D)\Delta)$ rounds with high
probability, where $D$ and $\Delta$ are the diameter and the maximum degree in
the network, respectively. For many topologies and selections of $k$ this bound
improves previous results, in particular, for graphs with a constant maximum
degree it implies that uniform gossip is \emph{order optimal} and the stopping
time is $\Theta(k + D)$.
  To eliminate the factor of $\Delta$ from the upper bound we propose a
non-uniform gossip protocol, TAG, which is based on algebraic gossip and an
arbitrary spanning tree protocol $\S$. The stopping time of TAG is $O(k+\log n
+d(\S)+t(\S))$, where $t(\S)$ is the stopping time of the spanning tree
protocol, and $d(\S)$ is the diameter of the spanning tree. We provide two
general cases in which this bound leads to an order optimal protocol. The first
is for $k=\Omega(n)$, where, using a simple gossip broadcast protocol that
creates a spanning tree in at most linear time, we show that TAG finishes after
$\Theta(n)$ rounds for any graph. The second uses a sophisticated, recent
gossip protocol to build a fast spanning tree on graphs with large weak
conductance. In turn, this leads to the optimally of TAG on these graphs for
$k=\Omega(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$. The technique used in our proofs relies on
queuing theory, which is an interesting approach that can be useful in future
gossip analysis.

opponents' moves based on past observations, and then decide what action to
take next. Behavioural economics studies the mechanisms by which strategic
decisions are taken in these adaptive learning processes. We here investigate a
model of learning the iterated prisoner's dilemma game. Players have the choice
between three strategies, always defect (ALLD), always cooperate (ALLC) and
tit-for-tat (TFT). The only strict Nash equilibrium in this situation is ALLD.
When players learn to play this game convergence to the equilibrium is not
guaranteed, for example we find cooperative behaviour if players discount
observations in the distant past. When agents use small samples of observed
moves to estimate their opponent's strategy the learning process is stochastic,
and sustained oscillations between cooperation and defection can emerge. These
cycles are similar to those found in stochastic evolutionary processes, but the
origin of the noise sustaining the oscillations is different and lies in the
imperfect sampling of the opponent's strategy. Based on a systematic expansion
technique, we are able to predict the properties of these learning cycles,
providing an analytical tool with which the outcome of more general stochastic
adaptation processes can be characterised.
