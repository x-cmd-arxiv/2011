or equal to n ordered by divisibility. It is known that the asymptotic rate of
growth of its Euler characteristic (the Mertens function) is closely related to
deep properties of the prime number system.
  In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the individual Betti
numbers and of their sum. We show that De_n has the homotopy type of a wedge of
spheres, and that as n tends to infinity: $$\sum \be_k(\De_n) =
\frac{2n}{\pi^2} + O(n^{\theta}),\;\; \mbox{for all} \theta > \frac{17}{54}.$$
  We also study a CW complex tDe_n that extends the previous simplicial
complex. In tDe_n all numbers up to n correspond to cells and its Euler
characteristic is the summatory Liouville function. This cell complex is shown
to be homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres, and as n tends to infinity:
$$\sum \be_k(\tDe_n) = \frac{n}{3} + O(n^{\theta}),\;\; \mbox{for all} \theta >

these previous results, we establish new instances of this conjecture with
weaker hypotheses on the atom distribution and stronger notions of convergence.
In particular, assuming only a finite moment condition on the atom

additional regularity condition, we can upgrade this convergence to locally
$L^1$ convergence.

scale, by which $Z_2$-odd right-handed neutrinos receive Majorana masses of the
electroweak scale. The lightest one is a dark matter candidate, whose stability
is guaranteed by the $Z_2$ parity. Resulting lepton number violation is
transmitted to the left-handed neutrinos $\nu_L^i$ via the loop-induced

generated without excessive fine tuning. The observed dark matter abundance can
be reproduced by the pair annihilation via the s-channel scalar exchange due to
mixing of neutral components of $\Phi$ and $S$, where $\Phi$ and $S$
respectively represent the Higgs doublet and the additional scalar singlet with
the $B-L$ charge. The model can be tested at collider experiments as well as
flavor experiments through the discriminative predictions such as two light
neutral Higgs bosons with large mixing, invisible decays of the Higgs bosons as

effective smooth $T^n = (S^1)^n$-action with non-empty fixed points. Petrie
\cite{petrie:1973} has shown that any homotopy equivalence between a complex
projective space $\CP^n$ and a torus manifold homotopy equivalent to $\CP^n$
preserves their Pontrjagin classes. A \emph{generalized Bott manifold} is a
closed smooth manifold obtained as the total space of an iterated complex
projective space bundles over a point, where each fibration is a
projectivization of the Whitney sum of a finite many complex line bundles. For
instance, we obtain a product of complex projective spaces if all fibrations
are trivial. If each fiber is $\CP^1$, then we call it an (ordinary) \emph{Bott
manifold}. In this paper, we investigate the invariance of Pontrjagin classes
for torus manifolds whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to that of generalized
Bott manifolds. We show that any cohomology ring isomorphism between two torus
manifolds whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to that of a product of
projective spaces preserves their Pontrjagin classes, which generalizes the
Petrie's theorem. In addition, we show that any cohomology ring isomorphism
between two torus cohomology Bott manifolds preserves their Pontrjagin classes.
As a corollary, there are at most a finite number of torus manifolds homotopy
equivalent to either a given product of complex projective space or a given
Bott manifold.

interplay of phenotypic variation and natural selection through ecological
interactions. The population is modeled as a stochastic point process whose
generator captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth,
mutation, and death, as influenced by each individual's trait values, and
interactions between individuals. An offspring usually inherits the trait
values of her progenitor, except when a random mutation causes the offspring to
take an instantaneous mutation step at birth to new trait values. In the case
we are interested in, the probability distribution of mutations has a heavy
tail and belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law. We investigate
the large-population limit with allometric demographies: larger populations
made up of smaller individuals which reproduce and die faster, as is typical
for micro-organisms. We show that depending on the allometry coefficient the
limit behavior of the population process can be approximated by nonlinear
L\'evy flights of different nature: either deterministic, in the form of
nonlocal fractional reaction-diffusion equations, or stochastic, as nonlinear
super-processes with the underlying reaction and a fractional diffusion
operator. These approximation results demonstrate the existence of such
nontrivial fractional objects; their uniqueness is also proved.

harmonic confinement and temperature for bosons in a two dimensional optical

for the Bose-Hubbard model in terms of experimental parameters -- the particle
number, confining potential and interaction strength. To distinguish the nature
of the spatially separated superfluid, Mott Insulator and normal Bose liquid
phases, we examine the local density, compressibility, superfluid density and
Green's function. In the annular superfluid rings, as the width of the ring
decreases, the long range superfluid correlations start to deviate from an
equivalent homogeneous 2D system. At zero temperature, the correlation decay is
intermediate between 1D and 2D, while at finite temperature, the decay is
similar to that in 1D at a much lower temperature. The calculations reveal
shortcomings of the local density approximation (LDA) in describing superfluid
properties of trapped bosons. We also present the finite temperature phase
diagram for the homogeneous two dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. We compare our
state diagram with the results of a recent experiment at NIST on a harmonically
trapped 2D lattice [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 110401 (2010)], and identify a finite

message bandwidth) that minimizes the probability of causing disruptive
interference for ad hoc wireless networks or cognitive radios is investigated.
Two basic problem constraints are considered: a given message size, or fixed
data rate. Implicitly, the trade being optimized is between longer transmit
duration and wider bandwidth versus higher transmit power. Both single-input
single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links are
considered. Here, a link optimizes its spectral efficiency to be a ""good
neighbor."" The probability of interference is characterized by the probability
that the signal power received by a hidden node in a wireless network exceeds
some threshold. The optimized spectral efficiency is a function of the
transmitter-to-hidden-node channel exponent, exclusively. It is shown that for
typical channel exponents a spectral efficiency of slightly greater than
1~b/s/Hz per antenna is optimal. It is also shown that the optimal spectral
efficiency is valid in the environment with multiple hidden nodes. Also
explicit evaluations of the probability of collisions is presented as a
function of spectral efficiency.

in the presence of a cosmological constant. We construct the solution
representing a BH pair with a domain wall and compute the Euclidean action to
evaluate the probability of the pair creation in the background with a
preexisting domain wall. The BHs can be either neutral or magnetically charged
ones. We compare the results of the charged case with those of the neutral case
with the same cosmological constant. We find that the production rate of a
charged BH pair is always suppressed in comparison with that of the neutral one
in both four and five dimensions, irrespective of the sign of the cosmological
constant. The Euclidean action is equal to the minus of the entropy. Since the
horizon area of a BH is decreased as the magnitude of its charge is increased
in general, the decreasing creation rate can be understood in terms of the
increasing charge. We obtain the explicit confirmation on the relation between
the pair creation rate of the charged BHs and the area of horizons in both the
four- and five-dimensional cases in the presence of a cosmological constant.
The singularity of the domain wall universe with charged BHs, as distinct from
that with neutral BHs, can be avoided.

size increase with wavelength, redward of 2.29 microns. We are able to model
this linear size increase with the addition of an extended water-vapor envelope
around the star. However, we are not able to fit the data in the CO bandheads.
Either the mass of the star is overestimated by the stellar-evolution models
and/or there is an additional extended CO envelope in the outer part of the
atmosphere. In any case, neither the water-vapor envelope, nor the CO envelope,
can be explained using the current models.

after some failures, whatever remains from the structure should still be
effective for whatever remains from the network. In this paper we examine
spanners of general graphs that are tolerant to vertex failures, and
significantly improve their dependence on the number of faults $r$, for all
stretch bounds.
  For stretch $k \geq 3$ we design a simple transformation that converts every
$k$-spanner construction with at most $f(n)$ edges into an $r$-fault-tolerant
$k$-spanner construction with at most $O(r^3 \log n) \cdot f(2n/r)$ edges.
Applying this to standard greedy spanner constructions gives $r$-fault tolerant
$k$-spanners with $\tilde O(r^{2} n^{1+\frac{2}{k+1}})$ edges. The previous
construction by Chechik, Langberg, Peleg, and Roddity [STOC 2009] depends
similarly on $n$ but exponentially on $r$ (approximately like $k^r$).
  For the case $k=2$ and unit-length edges, an $O(r \log n)$-approximation
algorithm is known from recent work of Dinitz and Krauthgamer [arXiv 2010],
where several spanner results are obtained using a common approach of rounding
a natural flow-based linear programming relaxation. Here we use a different
(stronger) LP relaxation and improve the approximation ratio to $O(\log n)$,
which is, notably, independent of the number of faults $r$. We further
strengthen this bound in terms of the maximum degree by using the \Lovasz Local
Lemma.
  Finally, we show that most of our constructions are inherently local by
designing equivalent distributed algorithms in the LOCAL model of distributed
computation.

separable sampling, 2D signal recovery problem can be converted into 1D signal
recovery problem so that ordinary 1D recovery algorithms, e.g. orthogonal

extension of 1D-OMP. In the 2D-OMP, each atom in the dictionary is a matrix. At
each iteration, the decoder projects the sample matrix onto 2D atoms to select
the best matched atom, and then renews the weights for all the already selected
atoms via the least squares. We show that 2D-OMP is in fact equivalent to
1D-OMP, but it reduces recovery complexity and memory usage significantly.
What's more important, by utilizing the same methodology used in this paper,
one can even obtain higher dimensional OMP (say 3D-OMP, etc.) with ease.

mass leads to appearance of far-ranging forces of gravitational interaction.
Finally, strong interaction appears in the model as internal gravitational
solution of 'black whole' type with the peculiar 'gravitational' constant. The
solution is a product of interaction of major vector fields pair with charged
W-bosons pair. It is inferred from the model that the state space is
ten-dimensional. The space is built as a module of the matrix representation of

account chain elasticity as well as electrostatic interactions between charged
spheres and chain segments. Using a numerical optimization method based on a
periodically repeated unit cell, we obtain fiber configurations that minimize
the total energy. The optimal configurations exhibit a variety of helical
structures for the arrangement of macroions including zig-zag, solenoidal and
beads-on-a-string patterns. These structures are determined by a competition
between attraction between spheres and the PE chain (which favors chain
wrapping around the spheres), chain bending and electrostatic repulsion between
chain segments (which favor unwrapping of the chain), and the interactions
between neighboring sphere-chain complexes which can be attractive or repulsive
depending on the system parameters such as medium salt concentration, macroion
charge and chain length per macroion (linker size). At about physiological salt
concentration, dense zig-zag patterns are found to be energetically most stable
when parameters appropriate for the DNA-histone system in a chromatin fiber are
adopted. In fact, the predicted fiber diameter in this regime is found to be
around 30nm, which appears to agree with the thickness observed in in vitro
experiments on chromatin. We also find a macroion density of 5-6 per 11nm which
agrees with the zig-zag or cross-linker models of chromatin. Since our study
deals primarily with a generic model, these findings suggest that
chromatin-like structures should also be observable for PE-macroion complexes
formed in solutions of DNA and synthetic nano-colloids of opposite charge.

the satellite galaxies are less preferentially located along the major axis of
the matter distribution, possibly reducing the tension with obersevational

energy acts as an additional tidal force on the satellite galaxies diminishing
the alignments between their distribution and the matter one. Through a Wald
test based on the generalized chi-square statistics, the null hypothesis that
the two probability distributions come from the same parent population is
rejected at the 99 % confidence level. It is concluded that the galaxy-matter

duration of $\sim$ 1.4 Gyr which formed $\sim 90%$ of the stars. Subsequently,
\objectname[]{LGS-3} continued forming stars until the present, although at a
much lower rate. The lack of early chemical enrichment is in contrast to that
observed in the isolated dSph galaxies of comparable luminosity, implying that
the dSphs were more massive and subjected to more tidal stripping.
  We compare the SFH of \objectname[]{LGS-3} with expectations from
cosmological models. Most or all the star formation was produced in
\objectname[]{LGS-3} after the reionization epoch, assumed to be completed at
$z\sim6$ or $\sim 12.7$ Gyr ago. The total mass of the galaxy is estimated to
be between 2 and $4\times 10^8$ M$_\odot$, corresponding to circular velocities
between 28 km\ s$^{-1}$ to 36 km\ s$^{-1}$. These values are close to but
somewhat above the limit of 30 km\ s$^{-1}$ below which the UV background is
expected to prevent any star formation after reionization. Feedback from SNe
associated with the initial episode of star formation (mechanical luminosity
from SNe $L_w=5.3\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) is probably inadequate to
completely blow away the gas. However, the combined effects of SN feedback and
UV background heating might be expected to completely halt star formation at
the reionization epoch for the low mass of \objectname[]{LGS-3}; this suggests
that self-shielding is important to the early evolution of galaxies in this
mass range.

morphology of the disc is examined. The aim of this work is to characterise the
prevalence of spiral structure in this sample and, in the cases where a clear
spiral pattern is found, include the findings in a comparative study (reported
in paper II). A two-armed (`grand design') spiral pattern is found in
approximately half the galaxies studied, including all those that are
designated as grand design in the optical, but also including some, but not
all, optically flocculent galaxies. It is found that the level of
non-axisymmetric structure in the galaxies' mass distributions is only modestly
higher in those galaxies that are classified as `grand design' compared with
those that are not, implying that non-grand design galaxies possess significant
power in higher order modes. There is no evidence that bars preferentially
trigger the spirals, but they do appear to stir up non-axisymmetric structure
in the disc. In contrast, there is evidence that strong/close tidal
interactions with companion galaxies are associated with strong two-armed
spiral structure in the infrared, though there are a number of galaxies with
relatively weak infrared spiral structure that do not possess such companions.

breaking, we calculate the chiral condensate and the Dirac spectrum.
Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is induced by the broad low-momentum

projective group and the homothetic group of the space respectively. The
theorems are applied to classify the two dimensional Newtonian dynamical
systems, which admit a Lie point/Noether symmetry. Two cases are considered,
the non-conservative and the conservative forces. The use of the results is
demonstrated for the Kepler - Ermakov system, which in general is
non-conservative and for potentials similar to the H\`enon Heiles potential.
Finally it is shown that in a FRW background with no matter present, the only
scalar cosmological model which is integrable is the one for which 3-space is
flat and the potential function of the scalar field is exponential. It is
important to note that in all applications the generators of the symmetry
vectors are found by reading the appropriate entry in the relevant tables.

of the square root of (1-|V|^2), as an asymptotic model of the optical medium
built as a periodic set of thin layers of two-level atoms, resonantly
interacting with the electromagnetic field and inducing the Bragg reflection. A
family of bright solitons is found, which splits into stable and unstable
parts, exactly obeying the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. The soliton with the
largest amplitude, which is |V| = 1, is found in an explicit analytical form.
It is a ""quasi-peakon"", with a discontinuity of the third derivative at the
center. Families of exact cnoidal waves, built as periodic chains of
quasi-peakons, are found too. The ultimate solution belonging to the family of
dark solitons, with the background level |V| = 1, is a dark compacton, also
obtained in an explicit analytical form. Those bright solitons which are
unstable destroy themselves (if perturbed) attaining the critical amplitude,
|V| = 1. The dynamics of the wave field around this critical point is studied
analytically, revealing a switch of the system into an unstable phase.
Collisions between bright solitons are investigated too. The collisions between
fast solitons are quasi-elastic, while slowly moving ones merge into breathers,
which may persist or perish (in the latter case, also by attaining |V| = 1).

flow variables, in particular Nelsonian stochastics, is their empirical
inequivalence with quantum theory: They are unable to obtain a quantization
condition for flows around zeros which is automatically fulfilled by the wave
function.
  It is found that the quantization condition follows from a simple additional
postulate: The Laplace operator of the density has to be finite and positive at
zeros of the density. This postulate is a quite natural consequence of
subquantum theories, as far as they conform to a simple principle of minimal
distortion of the quantum solutions.

Gaussian state and investigate the relationships with quantum estimation. For
classical perturbations, i.e. perturbations to eigenvalues, we found that nG of
the perturbed state may be written as the quantum Fisher information (QFI)
distance minus a term depending on the infinitesimal energy change, i.e. it
provides a lower bound to statistical distinguishability. Upon moving on
isoenergetic surfaces in a neighbourhood of a Gaussian state, nG thus coincides
with a proper distance in the Hilbert space and exactly quantifies the
statistical distinguishability of the perturbations. On the other hand, for
perturbations leaving the covariance matrix unperturbed we show that nG
provides an upper bound to the QFI. Our results show that the geometry of
nonGaussian states in the neighbourhood of a Gaussian state is definitely not
trivial and cannot be subsumed by a differential structure. Nevertheless, the
analysis of perturbations to a Gaussian state reveals that nG may be a resource
for quantum estimation. The nG of specific families of perturbed Gaussian
states is analyzed in some details with the aim of finding the maximally non
Gaussian state obtainable from a given Gaussian one.

present in such scenarios, is hardly to be observed at ongoing and future
particle accelerator experiments, LHC included, because of very strong
constraints on the parameters and couplings responsible for the corresponding
|\Delta L| = 2 processes. If the heavy Majorana neutrinos N_j are observed and
they are associated only with the type I mechanism, they will behave
effectively like pseudo-Dirac fermions. Conversely, the observation of effects
proving the Majorana nature of N_j would imply that these heavy neutrinos have
additional relatively strong couplings to the Standard Model particles or that
light neutrino masses compatible with the observations are generated by a
mechanism other than see-saw (e.g., radiatively at one or two loop level) in
which the heavy Majorana neutrinos N_j are nevertheless involved.

for routing and opportunistic network coding, with fidelity. Using this model,
we show that fairness allocation by the MAC can seriously impact performance;
hence, we devise a new MAC that not only substantially improves throughput
relative to the current 802.11 MAC, but also provides fairness to flows of
information rather than to nodes. We show that the proper combination of
network coding, multi-packet reception, and our new MAC protocol achieves
super-additive throughput gains of up to 6.3 times that of routing alone with
the use of the standard 802.11 MAC. Finally, we extend the model to analyze the
asymptotic behavior of our new MAC as the number of nodes increases.

studied. The chain is regarded as a system of small particles subjected to
constraints on their reciprocal distances. It is proposed a treatment of
systems of this kind based on a set Langevin equations in which the noise is
characterized by a non-gaussian probability distribution. The method is
explained in the case of a freely hinged chain. In particular, the generating
functional of the correlation functions of the relevant degrees of freedom
which describe the conformations of this chain is derived. It is shown that in
the continuous limit this generating functional coincides with a model of an
inextensible chain previously discussed by one of the authors of this work.
Next, the approach developed here is applied to a inextensible chain, called
the freely jointed bar chain, in which the basic units are small extended
objects. The generating functional of the freely jointed bar chain is
constructed. It is shown that it differs profoundly from that of the freely
hinged chain. Despite the differences, it is verified that in the continuous
limit both generating functionals coincide as it is expected.
