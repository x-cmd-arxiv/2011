be expressed as the computation of marginal probabilities over a Markov Random
Field. The belief propagation algorithm, which is an exact procedure to compute
these marginals when the underlying graph is a tree, has gained its popularity
as an efficient way to approximate them in the more general case. In this
paper, we focus on an aspect of the algorithm that did not get that much
attention in the literature, which is the effect of the normalization of the
messages. We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization
strategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence. Following this,
we express the necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability of a
fixed point in terms of the graph structure and the beliefs values at the fixed
point. We also explicit some connexion between the normalization constants and
the underlying Bethe Free Energy.

Because of the duality of canonical coordinates and momenta, i.e. the angular

states over an infinite periodic chain. For the construction we use the analogy
with our quantization over a finite periodic chain where the phase space was
Z_M x Z_M. Properties of the coherent states constructed in this way are

shapes on the number counts of signal-to-noise peaks in wide field cosmic shear
maps. The two cosmological contributions to this particular weak lensing
statistic, namely the chance projection of Large Scale Structure and the
occurrence of real, cluster-sized dark matter halos, have been modeled
semi-analytically, thus allowing to easily introduce the effect of non-Gaussian
initial conditions. We performed a Fisher matrix analysis by taking into
account the full covariance of the peak counts in order to forecast the joint
constraints on the level of primordial non-Gaussianity and the amplitude of the
matter power spectrum that are expected by future wide field imaging surveys.
We find that positive-skewed non-Gaussianity increases the number counts of
cosmic shear peaks, more so at high signal-to-noise values, where the signal is
mostly dominated by massive clusters as expected. The increment is at the level
of ~1 for f_NL=10 and ~10 for f_NL=100 for a local shape of the primordial
bispectrum, while different bispectrum shapes give generically a smaller
effect. For a future survey on the model of the proposed ESA space mission
Euclid and by avoiding the strong assumption of being capable to distinguish
the weak lensing signal of galaxy clusters from chance projection of Large
Scale Structures we forecasted a 1-sigma error on the level of non-Gaussianity
of ~30-40 for the local and equilateral models, and of ~100-200 for the less
explored enfolded and orthogonal bispectrum shapes.

important challenge in computational statistics. Borrowing ideas from MacQueen
(1967) who introduced a sequential version of the $k$-means algorithm, a new
class of recursive stochastic gradient algorithms designed for the $k$-medians
loss criterion is proposed. By their recursive nature, these algorithms are
very fast and are well adapted to deal with large samples of data that are
allowed to arrive sequentially. It is proved that the stochastic gradient
algorithm converges almost surely to the set of stationary points of the
underlying loss criterion. A particular attention is paid to the averaged
versions, which are known to have better performances, and a data-driven
procedure that allows automatic selection of the value of the descent step is
proposed.
  The performance of the averaged sequential estimator is compared on a
simulation study, both in terms of computation speed and accuracy of the
estimations, with more classical partitioning techniques such as $k$-means,
trimmed $k$-means and PAM (partitioning around medoids). Finally, this new
online clustering technique is illustrated on determining television audience

between ""evolutionary"" models (where clusters can evolve from CC to NCC, mainly
through mergers) and ""primordial"" models (where the state of the cluster is
fixed ""ab initio"" by early mergers or pre-heating). We found that in a

X-ray data), none of the objects hosting a giant radio halo can be classified

change point detection. Although many methods have been proposed for detecting
multiple change points, using these methods to find multiple change points in a
large sample seems not feasible. In this article, a connection between multiple
change point detection and variable selection through a proper segmentation of
data sequence is established, and a novel approach is proposed to tackle
multiple change point detection problem via the following two key steps: (1)
apply the recent advances in consistent variable selection methods such as
SCAD, adaptive LASSO and MCP to detect change points; (2) employ a refine
procedure to improve the accuracy of change point estimation. Five algorithms
are hence proposed, which can detect change points with much less time and more
accuracy compared to those in literature. In addition, an optimal segmentation
algorithm based on residual sum of squares is given. Our simulation study shows
that the proposed algorithms are computationally efficient with improved change
point estimation accuracy. The new approach is readily generalized to detect
multiple change points in other models such as generalized linear models and
nonparametric models.

turbulence causing a non-diffusive turbulent flux of inertial and non-inertial

numerical simulations (DNS). In simulations with and without gravity, this
phenomenon is found to cause a peak in the particle number density around the
minimum of the mean fluid temperature for Stokes numbers less than 1, where the
Stokes number is the ratio of particle Stokes time to turbulent Kolmogorov time

large-scale inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of inertial particles.
The strength of this effect is maximum for Stokes numbers around unity, and
decreases again for larger values. The dynamics of inertial particles is
studied using Lagrangian modelling in forced temperature-stratified turbulence,

2009, eight reactors with a capacity of 4.9 GWe have been connected to the
electric grid and four older reactors, with a combined capacity of 2.64 GWe
have been terminated. Furthermore, 27 reactor constructions, dominated by China
(18) and Russia (4), have been initiated.
  The nuclear fission produced electric energy in 2009 followed the slow
decline, observed since 2007, with a total production of 2560 TWhe, 41 TWhe
(1.6%) less than in 2008 and roughly 100 TWhe less than in the record year
2006. The preliminary data from the first 10 months of 2010 in the OECD
countries indicate that nuclear power production in North-America remained at
the 2009 levels, while one observes a recovery in Europe with an increase of
2.5% and a strong rise of 5% in the OECD Asia-Pacific area compared to the same
period in 2009.
  Worldwide uranium mining has increased during 2009 by about 7000 tons to
almost 51000 tons. Still roughly 18000 tons of the 2010 world uranium
requirements need to be provided from the civilian and military reserves.

the Red Book, are that (1) the best understood RAR (reasonable assured) and IR
(inferred) resources, with a price tag of less than 40 US dollars/Kg, have been
inconsistently absorbed in the two to three times higher price categories and
(2) uranium mining in Kazakhstan is presented with a short lifetime. The

optimal bounds O(L^2polylog(L)) for the mixing time of the chain, where L is
the natural size of the system. The dynamics at a macroscopic scale should be
described by a deterministic mean curvature motion such that each point of the
surface feels a drift which tends to minimize the local surface tension.
Inspired by this heuristics, our approach consists in bounding the dynamics
with an auxiliary one which, with very high probability, follows quite closely
the deterministic mean curvature evolution. Key technical ingredients are
monotonicity, coupling and an argument due to D.B. Wilson in the framework of
lozenge tiling Markov Chains. Our approach works equally well for both models
despite the fact that their equilibrium maximal height fluctuations occur on
very different scales (logarithmic for monotone surfaces and L^{1/2} for the
SOS model). Finally, combining techniques from kinetically constrained spin
systems together with the above mixing time result, we prove an almost
diffusive lower bound of order 1/L^2 up to logarithmic corrections for the
spectral gap of the SOS model with horizontal size L and unbounded heights.

as an excess in the number of faint blue stars between quadrants 1 and 4 of the
Galaxy. The origin of the Cloud could be an interaction with the disk bar, a
triaxial thick disk or a merger remnant or stream. To better map the spatial
extent of the Cloud along the line of sight, we have obtained multi-color UBVR
photometry for 1.2 million stars in 63 fields approximately 1 square degree
each. Our analysis of the fields beyond the apparent boundaries of the excess
have already ruled out a triaxial thick disk as a likely explanation (Larsen,
Humphreys and Cabanela 2010) In this paper we present our results for the star
counts over all of our fields, determine the spatial extent of the over density
across and along the line of sight, and estimate the size and mass of the
Cloud. Using photometric parallaxes, the stars responsible for the excess are
between 1 and 6 kiloparsecs from the Sun, 0.5 -- 4 kpc above the Galactic
plane, and extends approximately 3-4 kiloparsecs across our line of sight. It
is thus a major substructure in the Galaxy. The distribution of the excess
along our sight lines corresponds with the density contours of the bar in the
Disk, and its most distant stars are directly over the bar. We also see through
the Cloud to its far side. Over the entire 500 square degrees of sky containing
the Cloud, we estimate more than 5.6 million stars and 1.9 million solar masses
of material. If the over density is associated with the bar, it would exceed
1.4 billion stars and more than than 50 million solar masses. Finally, we argue
that the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (Belokurov et al. 2007) is actually the Hercules
Thick Disk Cloud.

N_4 = 2 spacetime supersymmetry, the interpolation between the Spinor-Vector
dual vacua can be continuously realized. We trace the origin of the
Spinor-Vector duality map to the presence of underlying N = (2, 2) and N = (4,

correlations in the nucleon is further explored via a study of SSA in D (`D)
production at large transverse momenta with the aim of accessing the unexplored
tri-gluon correlation functions. The workshop participants identified the SSA
measurements in SIDIS as a golden program to study TMDs in both the sea and
valence quark regions and to study the role of gluons, with the Sivers
asymmetry measurements as examples. Such measurements will lead to major
advancement in our understanding of TMDs in the valence quark region, and more
importantly also allow for the investigation of TMDs in the sea quark region

two-way relay networks (TWRNs). Most works on this problem focus on pilot-based
approaches which impose a significant training overhead that reduces the
spectral efficiency of the system. To avoid such losses, this work proposes
blind channel estimation algorithms for AF TWRNs that employ constant-modulus
(CM) signaling. Our main algorithm is based on the deterministic maximum
likelihood (DML) approach. Assuming M-PSK modulation, we show that the
resulting estimator is consistent and approaches the true channel with high
probability at high SNR for modulation orders higher than 2. For BPSK, however,
the DML performs poorly and we propose an alternative algorithm that performs
much better by taking into account the BPSK structure of the data symbols. For
comparative purposes, we also investigate the Gaussian maximum-likelihood (GML)
approach which treats the data symbols as Gaussian-distributed nuisance
parameters. We derive the Cramer-Rao bound and use Monte-Carlo simulations to
investigate the mean squared error (MSE) performance of the proposed
algorithms. We also compare the symbol-error rate (SER) performance of the DML
algorithm with that of the training-based least-squares (LS) algorithm and
demonstrate that the DML offers a superior tradeoff between accuracy and
spectral efficiency.

supernova (SN), PTF 10bzf (SN 2010ah), detected by the Palomar Transient
Factory (PTF) on 2010 February 23. The SN distance is \cong 218 Mpc, greater
than GRB 980425 / SN 1998bw and GRB 060218 / SN 2006aj, but smaller than the
other SNe firmly associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We conducted a
multi-wavelength follow-up campaign with Palomar-48 inch, Palomar 60-inch,
Gemini-N, Keck, Wise, Swift, the Allen Telescope Array, CARMA, WSRT, and EVLA.
Here we compare the properties of PTF 10bzf with those of SN 1998bw and other
broad-line SNe. The optical luminosity and spectral properties of PTF 10bzf
suggest that this SN is intermediate, in kinetic energy and amount of 56Ni,
between non GRB-associated SNe like 2002ap or 1997ef, and GRB-associated SNe
like 1998bw. No X-ray or radio counterpart to PTF 10bzf was detected. X-ray
upper-limits allow us to exclude the presence of an underlying X-ray afterglow
as luminous as that of other SN-associated GRBs like GRB 030329 or GRB 031203.
Early-time radio upper-limits do not show evidence for mildly-relativistic
ejecta. Late-time radio upper-limits rule out the presence of an underlying
off-axis GRB, with energy and wind density similar to the SN-associated GRB
030329 and GRB 031203. Finally, by performing a search for a GRB in the time
window and at the position of PTF 10bzf, we find that no GRB in the IPN catalog
could be associated with this SN.

wireless networks under general interference constraints. Our goal is to design
scheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information,
maintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information,
while guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressure
algorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destination
information. It is usually difficult to obtain and maintain this type of
information, especially in large networks, where there are numerous flows.
Also, the back-pressure algorithm maintains a complex data structure at each
node, keeps exchanging queue length information among neighboring nodes, and
commonly results in poor delay performance. In this paper, we propose
scheduling schemes that can circumvent these drawbacks and guarantee throughput
optimality. These schemes use either the readily available hop-count
information or only the local information for each link. We rigorously analyze
the performance of the proposed schemes using fluid limit techniques via an
inductive argument and show that they are throughput-optimal. We also conduct
simulations to validate our theoretical results in various settings, and show
that the proposed schemes can substantially improve the delay performance in
most scenarios.

uncertain. While an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxies
may be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of their
ionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. Attempts to
measure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lower
redshifts have largely yielded upper limits. In this paper we present new HST
COS and archival FUSE far-UV spectroscopy of a sample of eleven Lyman Break
Analogs (LBAs), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble the
high-z Lyman Break galaxies. We combine these data with SDSS optical spectra
and Spitzer photometry. We also analyze archival FUSE observations of fifteen
typical UV-bright local starbursts. We find evidence of small covering factors
for optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. This is based on two independent
pieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of the
strongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratio
of extinction-corrected H-alpha to UV plus far-IR luminosities. These objects
represent three of the four LBAs that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),
and highly massive (~10^9 Mo) dominant central object (DCO). These three
objects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount of
blueshifted Ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factor
of neutral gas. All four LBAs with DCOs in our sample show extremely high
velocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about
700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s. We show that
these properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburst
that is exceptionally compact. We speculate that such extreme feedback may be
required to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies.

addressed the problem of online testing of faults that result single-bit error
at the outputs based on parity preserving logic. In this work, we propose a
methodology for the concurrent error detection in reversible logic circuits to
detect faults that can result in multi-bit error at the outputs. The
methodology is based on the inverse property of reversible logic and is termed
as 'inverse and compare' method. By using the inverse property of reversible
logic, all the inputs can be regenerated at the outputs. Thus, by comparing the
original inputs with the regenerated inputs, the faults in reversible circuits
can be detected. Minimizing the garbage outputs is one of the main goals in
reversible logic design and synthesis. We show that the proposed methodology
results in 'garbageless' reversible circuits. A design of reversible full adder
that can be concurrently tested for multi-bit error at the outputs is
illustrated as the application of the proposed scheme. Finally, we showed the
application of the proposed scheme of concurrent error detection towards fault
detection in quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) emerging nanotechnology.

Major mergers of disk galaxies are assumed to be a mechanism for producing
ellipticals, but semi-analytic galaxy formation models (SAM) have encountered
apparent difficulties in reproducing the observed slope and scatter of the
size-mass relation. We study the scaling relations of merger remnants using
progenitor properties from two SAMs. We apply a simple merger model that
includes gas dissipation and star formation based on theoretical considerations
and simulations. Combining the SAMs and the merger model allows calculation of
the structural properties of the remnants of major mergers that enter the
population of elliptical galaxies at a given redshift. Without tuning the
merger model parameters for each SAM, the results roughly match the slope and
scatter in the observed scaling relations and their evolution in the redshift
range $z=0-3$. Within this model, the observed scaling relations, including the
tilt of the fundamental plane relative to the virial plane, result primarily
from the decrease of gas fraction with increasing progenitor mass. The scatter
in the size-mass relation of the remnants is reduced from that of the
progenitors because of a correlation between progenitor size and gas fraction
at a given mass.

Myr old Chamaeleon I star-forming region, obtained with the Spitzer Infrared
Spectrograph (IRS). We have classified these objects into various evolutionary
classes based on their spectral energy distributions and the spectral features
seen in the IRS spectra. We have analyzed the mid-IR spectra of Class II
objects in Chamaeleon I in detail, in order to study the vertical and radial
structure of the protoplanetary disks surrounding these stars. We find evidence
for substantial dust settling in most protoplanetary disks in Chamaeleon I. We
have identified several disks with altered radial structures in Chamaeleon I,
among them transitional disk candidates which have holes or gaps in their
disks. Analysis of the silicate emission features in the IRS spectra of Class
II objects in Chamaeleon I shows that the dust grains in these disks have
undergone significant processing (grain growth and crystallization). However,
disks with radial holes/gaps appear to have relatively unprocessed grains. We
further find the crystalline dust content in the inner (< 1-2 AU) and the
intermediate (< 10 AU) regions of the protoplanetary disks to be tightly
correlated. We also investigate the effects of accretion and stellar
multiplicity on the disk structure and dust properties. Finally, we compare the
observed properties of protoplanetary disks in Cha I with those in slightly
younger Taurus and Ophiuchus regions and discuss the effects of disk evolution
in the first 1-2 Myr.

formation (on some scale) and AGN activity. Inefficient fueling (and/or
feedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we
argue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We
show that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical
reasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will
quickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.
However, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively
inefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the
stars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.
Moreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk
instabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the
BH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can
therefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has
significantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of
these effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of
BH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale
corresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local
dynamical times). This predicts that the inferred delay will vary in a specific
manner with the radius over which the star formation rate is measured. We
discuss possible implications for the role of AGN feedback in suppressing star
formation activity.

above the photosphere to form collisionless shocks. We demonstrate that in

transit can experience mass loss from their surfaces. Motivated by these
findings, this paper considers outflows from Hot Jupiters in the regime where
the flow is controlled by magnetic fields. Given the mass loss rates estimated
from current observations --- and from theoretical arguments --- magnetic
fields will dominate the flow provided that field strength near the planet is
greater than $\sim1$ gauss, comparable to the surface fields of the Sun and
Jupiter. The problem can be separated into an inner regime, near the planet,
where the outflow is launched, and an outer regime where the flow follows
(primarily) stellar field lines and interacts with the stellar wind. This paper
concentrates on the flow in the inner regime. For a dipole planetary field with
a spatially constant background contribution, we construct a set of orthogonal
coordinates that follow the field lines and determine the corresponding
differential operators. Under the assumption of isothermal flow, we
analytically find the conditions required for escaping material to pass
smoothly through the sonic transition, and then estimate the mass outflow
rates. These magnetically controlled outflows differ significantly from
previous spherical models: The outflow rates are somewhat smaller, typically
${\dot M}$ $\sim 10^{9}$ g/s, and the flow is launched primarily from the polar
regions of the planet. In addition, if the stellar wind is strong enough, the
flow could be reversed and the planet could gain mass from the star.

play practical roles in current ongoing strange flavor hadron physics research.
To this end, we pedagogically study the SU(3) Lie algebra, its spin symmetries,
and its eigenvalues for irreducible representations. We also evaluate the
values of the Wigner D functions related to the isoscalar factors; these
functions are immediately applicable to strange flavor hadron phenomenology.
Exploiting these SU(3) group properties associated with the spin symmetries, we
investigate the decuplet-to-octet transition magnetic moments and the baryon
octet and decuplet magnetic moments in the flavor symmetric limit to construct
the Coleman-Glashow-type sum rules.

of vortices formed along the interface between an erupting (dimming) region and
the surrounding corona. They ranged in size from several to ten arcseconds, and
traveled along the interface at 6-14 km/s. The features were clearly visible in
six out of the seven different EUV wavebands of the Atmospheric Imaging

these features, we identified these features as the first observations of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability in the corona in EUV. The interpretation is
supported by linear analysis and by MHD model of KH instability. We conclude
that the instability is driven by the velocity shear between the erupting and
closed magnetic field of the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). The shear flow driven
instability can play an important role in energy transfer processes in coronal

Component-based design
is widely considered as a major approach to developing systems in a time and
cost effective way. Central in this approach is the notion of an interface.
Interfaces summarize the externally visible properties of a component and are
seen as a key to achieving component interoperability and to predict global
system behavior based on the component behavior. To capture the intricacy of
complex software products, rich interfaces have been proposed. These interfaces
do not only specify syntactic properties, such as the signatures of methods and
operations, but also take into account behavioral and extra-functional
properties, such as quality of service, security and dependability. Rich
interfaces have been proposed for describing, e.g., the legal sequences of
messages or method calls accepted by components, or the resource and timing

equivalent width of the \rm{H}$\alpha$ emission line, star formation rate, and
gas-phase metallicity from the spectra and compare these with the lightcurve
widths and colors of SNe Ia. In addition, we compare host properties with the
deviation of the observed distance modulus corrected for lightcurve parameters
from the distance modulus determined by the best fit cosmological parameters.
This allows us to investigate uncorrected systematic effects in the magnitude
standardization. We find that SNe Ia in host galaxies with a higher star
formation rate have synthesized on average a larger $^{56}$Ni mass and show
wider lightcurves. The $^{56}$Ni mass dependence on metallicity is consistent
with a prediction of Timmes et al. 2003 based on nucleosynthesis. SNe Ia in
metal-rich galaxies ({$\log_{10}(O/H)+12>8.9$) have become 0.13 $\pm$ 0.06
magnitude brighter after corrections for their lightcurve widths and colors,
which corresponds to up to 6% uncertainty in the luminosity distance. We
investigate whether parameters for standardizing SN Ia maximum magnitude differ
among samples with different host characteristics. The coefficient of the color
term is larger by 0.67 $\pm$ 0.19 for SNe Ia in metal-poor hosts than those in
metal-rich hosts when no color cuts are imposed.

control system. In a CBTC system, to guarantee the safety of train operation,
trains communicate with each other intensively and adjust their control modes
autonomously by computing critical control parameters, e.g. velocity range,
according to the information they get. As the correctness of the control
parameters generated are critical to the safety of the system, a method to
verify these parameters is a strong desire in the area of train control system.
In this paper, we present our ideas of how to model and verify the control
parameter calculations in a CBTC system efficiently. - As the behavior of the
system is highly nondeterministic, it is difficult to build and verify the
complete behavior space model of the system online in advance. Thus, we propose
to model the system according to the ongoing behavior model induced by the
control parameters. - As the parameters are generated online and updated very
quickly, the verification result will be meaningless if it is given beyond the
time bound, since by that time the model will be changed already. Thus, we
propose a method to verify the existence of certain dangerous scenarios in the
model online quickly. To demonstrate the feasibility of these proposed
approaches, we present the composed linear hybrid automata with readable shared
variables as a modeling language to model the control parameters calculation
and give a path-oriented reachability analysis technique for the scenario-based
verification of this model. We demonstrate the model built for the CBTC system,
and show the performance of our technique in fast online verification. Last but
not least, as CBTC system is a typical CPS system, we also give a short
discussion of the potential directions for CPS verification in this paper.

near-optimal performance in MIMO-ISI channels with large dimensions can be
achieved at low complexities through simple yet effective
simplifications/approximations, although the graphical models that represent
MIMO-ISI channels are fully/densely connected (loopy graphs). These include 1)
use of Markov Random Field (MRF) based graphical model with pairwise
interaction, in conjunction with {\em message/belief damping}, and 2) use of
Factor Graph (FG) based graphical model with {\em Gaussian approximation of
interference} (GAI). The per-symbol complexities are $O(K^2n_t^2)$ and
$O(Kn_t)$ for the MRF and the FG with GAI approaches, respectively, where $K$
and $n_t$ denote the number of channel uses per frame, and number of transmit
antennas, respectively. These low-complexities are quite attractive for large
dimensions, i.e., for large $Kn_t$. From a performance perspective, these
algorithms are even more interesting in large-dimensions since they achieve
increasingly closer to optimum detection performance for increasing $Kn_t$.
Also, we show that these message passing algorithms can be used in an iterative
manner with local neighborhood search algorithms to improve the
reliability/performance of $M$-QAM symbol detection.

asked whether G can be made Eulerian by adding arcs whose total weight does not
exceed a given threshold. This problem is motivated through applications in
vehicle routing and flowshop scheduling. However, EE is NP-hard and thus we use
the parameterized complexity framework to analyze it. In parameterized
complexity, the running time of algorithms is considered not only with respect
to input length, but also with respect to other properties of the input -
called ""parameters"". Dorn et. al. proved that EE can be solved in O(4^k n^4)
time, where k denotes the parameter ""number of arcs that have to be added"". In
this thesis, we analyze EE with respect to the (smaller) parameters ""number c

outdeg(v) for all vertices v in the input graph where this value is positive"".

observations about the sets of arcs that have to be added to the input graph in
order to make it Eulerian. We build upon these observations to restate EE in a
matching context. This matching formulation of EE might be an important tool to
solve the question of whether EE can be solved within running time whose
superpolynomial part depends only on c. We also consider polynomial time
preprocessing routines for EE and show that these routines cannot yield
instances whose size depends polynomially only on either of the parameters b,

liquid in a doped graphene sheet are strongly renormalized by electron-electron
interactions even in the long-wavelength limit. This effect is not captured by
the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), commonly used to describe electron fluids
and is due to coupling between the center of mass motion and the pseudospin
degree of freedom of the graphene's massless Dirac fermions. Making use of
diagrammatic perturbation theory to first order in the electron-electron
interaction, we show that this coupling enhances both the plasmon frequency and
the Drude weight relative to the RPA value. We also show that interactions are
responsible for a significant enhancement of the optical conductivity at
frequencies just above the absorption threshold. Our predictions can be checked
by far-infrared spectroscopy or inelastic light scattering.

understanding the properties of suitable (convergent) sequences $(G_n)$ of
graphs in terms of a limiting object which may be represented by a symmetric
function $W$ on $[0,1]$, i.e., a kernel or graphon. In this context it is
natural to wish to relate specific properties of the sequence to specific
properties of the kernel. Here we show that the kernel is monotone (i.e.,
increasing in both variables) if and only if the sequence satisfies a
`quasi-monotonicity' property defined by a certain functional tending to zero.
As a tool we prove an inequality relating the cut and $L^1$ norms of kernels of
the form $W_1-W_2$ with $W_1$ and $W_2$ monotone that may be of interest in its
own right; no such inequality holds for general kernels.

stars and solving Einstein equations, we show that their merger results in a
rapidly spinning black hole surrounded by a hot and highly magnetized torus.
Lasting over 35 ms and much longer than previous simulations, our study reveals
that magnetohydrodynamical instabilities amplify an initially turbulent
magnetic field of ~ 10^{12} G to produce an ordered poloidal field of ~ 10^{15}
G along the black-hole spin-axis, within a half-opening angle of ~ 30 deg,
which may naturally launch a relativistic jet. The broad consistency of our
ab-initio calculations with SGRB observations shows that the merger of
magnetized neutron stars can provide the basic physical conditions for the
central-engine of SGRBs.

  Radiation Fields: Sources in the early Universe"", 2010, Hamburg, Germany",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first generations of astrophysical objects made a substantial impact on
our Universe with their radiation. X-rays from the first sources, with large
mean free paths, likely quickly heated the intergalactic medium (IGM). The
second generation of 21cm instruments can provide a unique view into this early
epoch. The early stages of reionization likely followed, driven by so-called
""minihalos"", i.e. molecularly-cooled halos. These small halos were susceptible
to complex feedback mechanisms, especially from the soft-UV background which
preceded reionization, resulting in complex and possibly extended early stages
of reionization. When atomically-cooled galaxies emerged as the dominant
ionizers, reionization could proceed more rapidly, with these being less
sensitive to radiative feedback than previously thought. Reionization could
have slowed in the final stages when the ionized bubbles grew larger than the
separation of Lyman limit absorption systems (LLSs). The final stages likely
involved the photo-evaporation of LLSs, which by then regulated the rise of the
UV background. I discuss the theoretical underpinnings of this narrative, as
well as how future 21cm observations may help shed light on the outstanding
uncertainties.
