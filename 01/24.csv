diffusion equation when the reaction term is the combustion nonlinearity with
ignition temperature. A key role in the proof is plaid by an explicit formula
for traveling wave solutions of a free boundary problem obtained as singular
limit for the reaction-diffusion equation (the so-called high energy activation
energy limit). This explicit formula, which is interesting in itself, also
allows us to get an estimate on the decay at infinity of the traveling wave

by different observers in the system. The method is based on the introduction
of an 'effective temperature' function that varies with time. First we
introduce a non-stationary vacuum state for a quantum scalar field, which
interpolates between the Boulware vacuum state at early times and the Unruh
vacuum state at late times. In this way we mimic the process of switching on
Hawking radiation in realistic collapse scenarios. Then, we analyse this vacuum
state from the perspective of static observers at different radial positions,
observers undergoing a free-fall trajectory from infinity and observers
standing at rest at a radial distance and then released to fall freely towards
the horizon. The physical image that emerges from these analyses is rather rich
and compelling. Among many other results, we find that generic freely-falling
observers do not perceive vacuum when crossing the horizon, but an effective
temperature a few times larger than the one that they perceived when it started
to free-fall. We explain this phenomenon as due to a diverging Doppler effect
at horizon crossing.

$B_{kq}$ that lead to the correct CF splitting second moments, both the global
one $\sigma$ and the partial ones $\sigma_{k}$. Only such parametrizations
correspond to the appropriate multipolar structure of the surrounding CF. Each
parametrization being characterized by its own multipolar crystal-field
strengths $S_{k}=(\frac{1}{2k+1}\sum\limits_{q}|B_{kq}|^{2})^{1/2}$, for
$k=2,4$ and 6, yields a definite second moment $\sigma$, which can be derived
from the additivity relationship $\sigma^{2}=\sum_{k}\sigma_{k}^{2}$ and the
known asphericities $< \Psi||C^{(k)}||\Psi >$ of the central-ion eigenfunctions
$\Psi$. The condition $\sigma=\sigma_{\rm exp}$ must be satisfied to ensure the
parametrization's correctness. However, our survey of literature indicates that
there exists many other well-fitted crystal-field parameter sets that do not

should be re-examined or rejected. Having $\sigma$ for several $(\geq3)$

various parametrizations and the pertinent second moments observed in

consistent with the combined number density at z~3 of DLAs and sub-DLAs, which
comprise the main population of low-ionization systems at lower redshifts. This
apparent lack of evolution may occur because low ionization systems are hosted
by lower-mass halos at higher redshifts, or because the mean cross section of
low-ionization gas at a given halo mass increases with redshift due to the
higher densities and lower ionizing background. The roughly constant number
density notably contrasts with the sharp decline at z > 5.3 in the number
density of highly-ionized systems traced by C IV. The low-ionization systems at
z~6 span a similar range of velocity widths as lower-redshift sub-DLAs but have
significantly weaker lines at a given width. This implies that the
mass-metallicity relation of the host galaxies evolves towards lower
metallicities at higher redshifts. These systems lack strong Si IV and C IV,
which are common among lower-redshift DLAs and sub-DLAs. This is consistent,
however, with a similar decrease in the metallicity of the low- and
high-ionization phases, and does not necessarily indicate a lack of nearby,
highly-ionized gas. The high number density of low-ionization systems at z~6
suggests that we may be detecting galaxies below the current limits of
i-dropout and Ly-alpha emission galaxy surveys. These systems may therefore be
the first direct probes of the `typical' galaxies responsible for hydrogen

framework for the variation of Newton's fundamental constant, conveyed by the
dynamics of a scalar-field non-minimally coupled to the space-time geometry.
The experimental scrutiny of scalar-tensor gravity theories has led to a
detailed analysis of their post-newtonian features, and is encapsulated into
the so-called parametrised post-newtonian formalism (PPN). Of course this
approach can only be applied whenever there is a newtonian limit, and the
latter is related to the GR solution that is generalized by a given ST solution
under consideration. This procedure thus assumes two hypothesis: On the one
hand, that there should be a weak field limit of the GR solution; On the other
hand that the latter corresponds to the limit case of given ST solution. In the
present work we consider a ST solution with negative spatial curvature. It
generalizes a general relativistic solution known as being of a degenerate
class (A) for its unusual properties. In particular, the GR solution does not
exhibit the usual weak field limit in the region where the gravitational field
is static. The absence of a weak field limit for the hyperbolic GR solution
means that such limit is also absent for comparison with the ST solution, and
thus one cannot barely apply the PPN formalism. We therefore analyse the
properties of the hyperbolic ST solution, and discuss the question o defining a
generalised newtonian limit both for the GR solution and for the purpose of
contrasting it with the ST solution. This contributes a basic framework to
build up a parametrised pseudo-newtonian formalism adequate to test ST
negatively curved space-times.

adjunct to traditional shear-based techniques. As flexion arises from gradients
across an image, analytic and numerical techniques are required to investigate
flexion predictions for extended image/source pairs. Using the Schwarzschild
lens model, we demonstrate that the ray-bundle method for gravitational lensing
can be used to accurately recover second flexion, and is consistent with
recovery of zero first flexion. Using lens plane to source plane bundle
propagation, we find that second flexion can be recovered with an error no
worse than 1% for bundle radii smaller than {\Delta}{\theta} = 0.01 {\theta}_E
and lens plane impact pararameters greater than {\theta}_E + {\Delta}{\theta},
where {\theta}_E is the angular Einstein radius. Using source plane to lens
plane bundle propagation, we demonstrate the existence of a preferred flexion
zone. For images at radii closer to the lens than the inner boundary of this
zone, indicative of the true strong lensing regime, the flexion formalism
should be used with caution (errors greater than 5% for extended image/source
pairs). We also define a shear zone boundary, beyond which image shapes are
essentially indistinguishable from ellipses (1% error in ellipticity). While
suggestive that a traditional weak lensing analysis is satisfactory beyond this
boundary, a potentially detectable non-zero flexion signal remains.

physics of hadrons when used in conjunction with non-perturbative schemes such
as lattice QCD. In this discourse, the attention is focused on extrapolating
the mass of the rho meson to the physical pion mass in quenched QCD (QQCD).
With the absence of a known experimental value, this serves to demonstrate the
ability of the extrapolation scheme to make predictions without prior bias. By
using extended effective field theory developed previously, an extrapolation is
performed using quenched lattice QCD data that extends outside the chiral
power-counting regime (PCR). The method involves an analysis of the
renormalization flow curves of the low energy coefficients in a finite-range
regularized effective field theory. The analysis identifies an optimal
regulator, which is embedded in the lattice QCD data themselves. This optimal
regulator is the regulator value at which the renormalization of the low energy
coefficients is approximately independent of the range of quark masses
considered. By using recent precision, quenched lattice results, the
extrapolation is tested directly by truncating the analysis to a set of points
above 380 MeV, while being blinded of the results probing deeply into the
chiral regime. The result is a successful extrapolation to the chiral regime.

measurement system of how network characteristics and protocol implementation
influence the overall BitTorrent swarm performance.
  We base our approach on a framework that allows easy swarm creation and
control for different BitTorrent clients. With the help of a virtualized

to run, schedule, start, stop clients within a swarm and collect information

separating the computational behavior of the variable from the context. The

rebinding are hierarchical, that is, the term can contain arbitrarily nested
unbound terms, whose inside code can only be executed after a sequence of
rebinds has been applied. Correspondingly, types are decorated with levels, and
a term has type decorated with k if it needs k rebinds in order to reduce to a
value. With intersection types we model the fact that a term can be used
differently in contexts providing different numbers of unbinds. In particular,
top-level terms, that is, terms not requiring unbinds to reduce to values,
should have a value type, that is, an intersection type where at least one

soundness under the call-by-value strategy, an issue which was not resolved by

for some class of inverse problems whose governing equations are given by
parabolic equations with discontinuous coefficients.
  The framework is given by considering a concrete inverse initial boundary
value problem for a parabolic equation with discontinuous coefficients. The
problem is to extract information about the location and shape of unknown
inclusions embedded in a known isotropic heat conductive body from a set of the
input heat flux across the boundary of the body and output temperature on the
same boundary. In the framework the original inverse problem is reduced to an
inverse problem whose governing equation has a large parameter. A list of
requirements which enables one to apply the enclosure method to the reduced
inverse problem is given.
  Two new results which can be considered as the application of the framework
are given. In the first result the background conductive body is assumed to be
homogeneous and a family of explicit complex exponential solutions are
employed. Second an application of the framework to inclusions in an isotropic
inhomogeneous heat conductive body is given. The main problem is the
construction of the special solution of the governing equation with a large
parameter for the background inhomogeneous body required by the framework. It
is shown that, introducing another parameter which is called the virtual
slowness and making it sufficiently large, one can construct the required
solution which yields an extraction formula of the convex hull of unknown
inclusions in a known isotropic inhomogeneous conductive body.

straightforward, but union types present challenges. For union types, we can
case-analyze a subterm of union type when it appears in evaluation position
(replacing the subterm with a variable, and checking that term twice under
appropriate assumptions). This technique preserves soundness in a call-by-value
semantics.
  Sadly, there are so many choices of subterms that a direct implementation is
not practical. But carefully transforming programs into let-normal form
drastically reduces the number of choices. The key results are soundness and
completeness: a typing derivation (in the system with too many subterm choices)
exists for a program if and only if a derivation exists for the let-normalized

randomized algorithm that, given any eps-weakly sparse sequence x, predicts a 0

perform this task with essentially the same success probability as under the
much stronger assumption that each bit of x takes the value 1 independently
with probability eps. We apply this result to show how to successfully predict
a bit (0 or 1) under a broad class of possible assumptions on the sequence x.
The assumptions are stated in terms of the behavior of a finite automaton M

their spherical cap $\mathbb{L}_2$-discrepancy to give the distance integral of
the uniform measure on the sphere a potential-theoretical quantity (Bj{\""o}rck

15099-5856 using the space telescopes AKARI and Spitzer, which demonstrate the
presence of prominent crystalline silicate emission in this bright source. IRAS
15099-5856 has a complex morphology with a bright central compact source (IRS1)
surrounded by knots, spurs, and several extended (~4') arc-like filaments. The
source is seen only at >= 10 um. The Spitzer MIR spectrum of IRS1 shows
prominent emission features from Mg-rich crystalline silicates, strong [Ne II]
12.81 um and several other faint ionic lines. We model the MIR spectrum as
thermal emission from dust and compare with the Herbig Be star HD 100546 and
the luminous blue variable R71, which show very similar MIR spectra. Molecular
line observations reveal two molecular clouds around the source, but no
associated dense molecular cores. We suggest that IRS1 is heated by UV
radiation from the adjacent O star Muzzio 10 and that its crystalline silicates
most likely originated in a mass outflow from the progenitor of the supernova
remnant (SNR) MSH 15-52. IRS1, which is embedded in the SNR, could have been
shielded from the SN blast wave if the progenitor was in a close binary system
with Muzzio 10. If MSH15-52 is a remnant of Type Ib/c supernova (SN Ib/c), as
has been previously proposed, this would confirm the binary model for SN Ib/c.
IRS1 and the associated structures may be the relics of massive star death, as
shaped by the supernova explosion, the pulsar wind and the intense ionizing
radiation of the embedded O star.

This gauge boson can also induce the top quark flavor-changing neutral-current
(FCNC) decays and the like-sign top pair production at the LHC. In this work we
focus on two models which predict such a Z', namely the left-right model and
the U(1)_X model, to investigate the correlated effects on $A^t_{FB}$, the FCNC
decays $t -> u V$ ($V=g,Z,\gamma$) and the like-sign top pair production at the

the large top pair invariant mass region. We find that under the current
experimental constraints both models can alleviate the deviation of $A^t_{FB}$

level of the LHC. We also find that the two models give different predictions
for the observables and their correlations, and thus they may even be
distinguished by jointly studying these top quark observables.

emission, and one of the main way to discover new sources of this class. From
the discovery of the first transient event around 2003, we now count about a
dozen of outbursts, which increased the number of these strongly magnetic
neutron stars by a third in six years. Magnetar outbursts might involve their
multi-band emission resulting in an increased activity from radio to hard
X-ray, usually with a soft X-ray flux increasing by a factor of 10-1000 with
respect to the quiescent level. A connected X-ray spectral evolution is also
often observed, with a spectral softening during the outburst decay. The flux
decay times vary a lot from source to source, ranging from a few weeks to
several years, as also the decay law which can be exponential-like, a power-law
or even multiple power-laws can be required to model the flux decrease. We
review here on the latest observational results on the multi-band emission of
magnetars, and summarize one by one all the transient events which could be
studied to date from these sources.

development of a powerful framework for the analysis of radio measurements of

shower radio emission in coincidence with the surface particle detectors and
fluorescence telescopes of the Pierre Auger Observatory, the radio analysis
functionality had to be incorporated in the existing hybrid analysis solutions
for fluoresence and surface detector data. This goal has been achieved in a
natural way by extending the existing Auger Offline software framework with
radio functionality. In this article, we lay out the design, highlights and
features of the radio extension implemented in the Auger Offline framework. Its
functionality has achieved a high degree of sophistication and offers advanced
features such as vectorial reconstruction of the electric field, advanced
signal processing algorithms, a transparent and efficient handling of FFTs, a
very detailed simulation of detector effects, and the read-in of multiple data
formats including data from various radio simulation codes. The source code of
this radio functionality can be made available to interested parties on
request.

nodes to improve the user broadband experience in a cost effective manner.
Femtocells are an integral part of heterogeneous networks, whose main purpose
is to improve the indoor capacity. When restricting access to home users,
femtocells cause a substantial interference problem that cannot be mitigated
through coordination with the macrocell base station. In this paper, we analyze
multiple antenna communication on the downlink of a macrocell network, with
femtocell overlay. We evaluate the feasibility of limited feedback beamforming
given delay on the feedback channel, quantization error and uncoordinated
interference from the femtocells. We model the femtocell spatial distribution
as a Poisson point process and the temporal correlation of the channel
according to a Gauss-Markov model. We derive the probability of outage at the
macrocell users as a function of the temporal correlation, the femtocell
density, and the feedback rate. We propose rate backoff to maximize the average
achievable rate in the network. Simulation results show that limited feedback
beamforming is a viable solution for femtocell networks despite the CSI
inaccuracy and the interference. They illustrate how properly designed rate
backoff improves the achievable rate of the macrocell system.

nuclear charge. Arranging the chemical elements in an increasing atomic number
order, a symmetry pattern known as the Periodic Table is detectable. The
correlation between nuclear charge and the Periodic System of the Chemical
Elements (PSCE) indicates that the symmetry emerges from the nucleus. Nuclear
symmetry can only exist if the relative positions of the nucleons in the
nucleus are invariant. Pauli exclusion principle can also be interpreted as the
nucleons should occupy a lattice position. Based on symmetry and other
indicatives face centered cubic arrangement have been proposed for the nuclear
lattice. A lattice model, representing the protons and the neutrons by equal
spheres and arranging them alternately in a face centered cubic structure
forming a double tetrahedron, is able to reproduce all of the properties of the
nucleus including the quantum numbers and the periodicity of the elements.
Based on the geometry of the nuclear structure it is shown that when a new
'layer' of the nuclear structure starts then the distance between the first
proton in the new layer and the charge center of the nucleus is smaller than
the distance of the proton, which completed the preceding 'layer'. Thus a new
valence electron shell should start to develop when the nuclear structure is
expanded. The expansion of the double tetrahedron FCC nuclear lattice model
offers a feasible physical explanation how the nucleus affects the electronic
configuration of the chemical elements depicted by the periodic table.

  review",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Techniques in which words are represented as vectors have proved useful in
many applications in computational linguistics, however there is currently no
general semantic formalism for representing meaning in terms of vectors. We
present a framework for natural language semantics in which words, phrases and
sentences are all represented as vectors, based on a theoretical analysis which
assumes that meaning is determined by context.
  In the theoretical analysis, we define a corpus model as a mathematical
abstraction of a text corpus. The meaning of a string of words is assumed to be
a vector representing the contexts in which it occurs in the corpus model.
Based on this assumption, we can show that the vector representations of words
can be considered as elements of an algebra over a field. We note that in
applications of vector spaces to representing meanings of words there is an
underlying lattice structure; we interpret the partial ordering of the lattice
as describing entailment between meanings. We also define the context-theoretic
probability of a string, and, based on this and the lattice structure, a degree
of entailment between strings.
  We relate the framework to existing methods of composing vector-based
representations of meaning, and show that our approach generalises many of
these, including vector addition, component-wise multiplication, and the tensor
product.

NMWD decay rates and nucleon spectra, but at present no direct evidence of such
a mechanism has been obtained. The FINUDA experiment, exploiting the
possibility to detect both charged and neutral particles coming from the

$\Gamma_{2N}$/$\Gamma_{NMWD}$=0.24$\pm$${0.03_{stat}}^{+0.03_{sys}}_{{-{0.02_{sys}}}}$

density at 5GHz and the gamma-ray intensity for the Fermi-LAT detected blazars

Galactic latitudes; IDV appears to be stronger in weaker sources, indicating
that the variability is affected by interstellar scintillation.

radioactivity as a new nuclear mode is presented. The essential theoretical and
experimental results obtained in the 25 years from the prediction of the
nuclear pionic radioactivity are reviewed. Using the fission-like model it was
shown that most of the SHE-nuclei lie in the region where the pionic fissility
parameters attain their limiting value X=1 (see Fig.2-3). Hence, the SHE-region
is characterized by the absence of a classical barrier toward spontaneous pion
emission. Consequently, both decay modes, the pionic fission and the
spontaneous fission of SHE nuclides, essentially will be determined only by
shell effects. Then, it was seen that the usual predicted SHE-island of
stability around the double magic nucleus 298-[114], which is not confirmed
experimentally, can be explained by the dominant pionic radioactivity of the
SHE-nuclei from this region. The bimodal symmetric (see Figs. 5ab) as well as,
the supergiant radioactive halos (see Fig. 6) as two important signature of the
nuclear pionic fission are evidentiated.

  Partial Interference Cancellation Group Decoding","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign
  error",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The partial interference cancellation (PIC) group decoding has recently been
proposed to deal with the decoding complexity and code rate trade-off on the
basis of space-time block code (STBC) design criterion when full diversity is
achieved. It provides a framework to arrange the rate-complexity-performance
tradeoff by choosing a suitable size of information symbol groups. In this
paper, a simple design of a linear dispersive space-time-frequency (STF) code
is proposed with a design criterion to achieve high rate for
frequency-selective channels in terms of multipath when the PIC group decoding
is applied at receiver. With an appropriate grouping scheme as well as the PIC
group decoding, the proposed STF code is shown to obtain the similar diversity
gain as the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, namely full-dimensional sphere
decoding, but have a low decoding complexity. It seems as an intermediate
decoding between the ML receiver and zero-forcing (ZF) receiver. The proposed
grouping design criterion for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity
deploying the orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technique is
also an intermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of
codewords and the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column
vectors for the equivalent frequency-selective channel matrix. It can achieves
full diversity with the PIC group decoding for any number of sub-carriers and
the data rate can be made high. Several code design examples are illustrated
for the feasibility of this coding scheme. Simulation results show that the
proposed STF code can well address the rate-performance-complexity tradeoff of
the multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) communication system.

kernelization, obtaining (and improving) several polynomial kernels for editing
problems on dense instances. We apply this technique on several well-studied
problems: Feedback Arc Set in (Bipartite) Tournaments, Dense Rooted Triplet
Inconsistency and Betweenness in Tournaments. For the former, one is given a
(bipartite) tournament $T = (V,A)$ and seeks a set of at most $k$ arcs whose
reversal in $T$ results in an acyclic (bipartite) tournament. While a linear
vertex-kernel is already known for the first problem, using the Conflict
Packing allows us to find a so-called safe partition, the central tool of the
kernelization algorithm in, with simpler arguments. For the case of bipartite
tournaments, the same technique allows us to obtain a quadratic vertex-kernel.
Again, such a kernel was already known to exist, using the concept of so-called
bimodules. We believe however that providing an unifying technique to cope with
such problems is interesting. Regarding Dense Rooted Triplet Inconsistency, one
is given a set of vertices $V$ and a dense collection $\mathcal{R}$ of rooted
binary trees over three vertices of $V$ and seeks a rooted tree over $V$
containing all but at most $k$ triplets from $\mathcal{R}$. As a main
consequence of our technique, we prove that the Dense Rooted Triplet
Inconsistency problem admits a linear vertex-kernel. This result improves the
best known bound of $O(k^2)$ vertices for this problem. Finally, we use this
technique to obtain a linear vertex-kernel for Betweenness in Tournaments,
where one is given a set of vertices $V$ and a dense collection $\mathcal{R}$
of so-called betweenness triplets and seeks a linear ordering of the vertices
containing all but at most $k$ triplets from $\mathcal{R}$.

beta decay has been recorded for 10 nuclei ($^{48}$Ca, $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se,
$^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, $^{128}$Te, $^{130}$Te, $^{150}$Nd,
$^{238}$U). In addition, the 2$\beta(2\nu)$ decay of $^{100}$Mo and $^{150}$Nd
to the 0$^+_1$ excited state of the daughter nucleus has been observed and the
ECEC(2$\nu$) process in $^{130}$Ba was observed too. As to neutrinoless double
beta decay (2$\beta(0\nu)$) this process has not yet been registered. In the
review results of the most sensitive experiments (Heidelberg-Moscow, IGEX,
CUORICINO, NEMO-3) are discussed and conservative upper limits on effective
Majorana neutrino mass and the coupling constant of the Majoron to the neutrino
are established as $\langle m_{\nu} \rangle < 0.75$ eV and $\langle g_{ee}
\rangle < 1.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$, respectively.
  The next-generation experiments, where the mass of the isotopes being studied
will be as grand as 100 to 1000 kg, are discussed. These experiments will have
started within a few years. In all probability, they will make it possible to
reach the sensitivity to the neutrino mass at a level of 0.01 to 0.1 eV.

density and quantum mechanics itself, with its current approach to CSMDSs, does
not allow a correct statistical interpretation. By the example of a 1D

identified through use of a combination of narrow and medium band filters
spanning the J and H bands, and which are particularly sensitive to the
presence of the 1.3-1.5{\mu}m H2O molecular band - unique to BDs. We provide a
calibration of the relationship between effective temperature and color for
both field stars and for BDs. This photometric method provides effective
temperatures for BDs to an accuracy of {\pm}350K relative to spectroscopic
techniques. This accuracy is shown to be not significantly affected by either
stellar surface gravity or uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. We
identify nine objects having effective temperature between 1700 and 2200 K,
typical of BDs, observed J-band magnitudes in the range 19.5-21.5, and that are
strongly clustered towards the luminous core of NGC 3603. However, if these are
located at the distance of the cluster, they are far too luminous to be normal
BDs. We argue that it is unlikely that these objects are either artifacts of
our dataset, normal field BDs/M-type giants or extra-galactic contaminants and,
therefore, might represent a new class of stars having the effective
temperatures of BDs but with luminosities of more massive stars. We explore the
interesting scenario in which these objects would be normal stars that have
recently tidally ingested a Hot Jupiter, the remnants of which are providing a
short-lived extended photosphere to the central star. In this case, we would

users can significantly degrade the performance for other classes. During these
transient periods, it is thus of crucial importance to implement priority
mechanisms that conserve the quality of service experienced by the affected
classes, while ensuring that the temporarily unstable class is not entirely
neglected. In this paper, we examine the complex interaction occurring between
several classes of traffic when classes obtain bandwidth proportionally to
their incoming traffic.
  We characterize the evolution of the network from the moment the initial
surge takes place until the system reaches its equilibrium. Using an
appropriate scaling, we show that the trajectories of the temporarily unstable
class can be described by a differential equation, while those of the stable
classes retain their stochastic nature. A stochastic averaging phenomenon
occurs and the dynamics of the temporarily unstable and the stable classes
continue to influence one another. We further proceed to characterize the
obtained differential equations and the stability region under this scaling for
monotone networks. We illustrate these result on several toy examples and we
finally build a penalization rule using these results for a network integrating

Carlo simulation of Ising model.
  Observations of only weak size effects and very small correction to scaling

  symmetries","24 pages",,,,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As shown by Mandula, the Ginsparg-Wilson lattice realisation of chiral
symmetry has a possible ambiguity: there is no unique lattice chiral symmetry,
but an infinite group of symmetries with non-commuting generators. The physical
implications of this abundance of symmetry remain unclear. In recent work, it
has been shown how these chiral symmetries for overlap fermions can be derived
from a renormalisation group blocking in the continuum, transforming the action
from the standard continuum action to an equivalent to the lattice overlap
action. There is no unique blocking, and different blockings lead to different
chiral symmetries. The group of symmetries found by Mandula immediately
follows. In this way, the excess chiral symmetry on the lattice can be
explained in terms of different renormalisation schemes.
  The previous work suffered from one technical challenge: there is no
continuum analogue of the lattice chiral eigenvectors at eigenvalue $2/a$. As
the construction of the overlap operator required a mapping between lattice and
continuum eigenvalues, the lack of a continuum counterpart to the doublers of
the zero modes creates an ambiguity in the construction. Although the lattice
chiral symmetry can still be defined, this leads to difficulties when
considering $\mathcal{CP}$ symmetry on the lattice. In this work, we
investigate the possibility of resolving this ambiguity by adding a second
fermion field to the original continuum action used as a basis of the
renormalisation group blockings. This second fermion field has a mass of the
order of the momentum cut-off, to simulate the effects of the fermion doublers.
Working through the same renormalisation group procedure to map this action to
the lattice overlap action yields additional Ginsparg-Wilson relations
satisfied by the overlap operator, and more (non-commuting) lattice chiral
symmetries.

time, the characteristic function is a random vector with realizations
restricted to some set of values. The game differs from other ones in the
literature on dynamic, stochastic or interval valued TU games as it combines
dynamics of the game with an allocation protocol for the players that
dynamically interact with each other. The protocol is an iterative and
decentralized algorithm that offers a paradigmatic mathematical description of
negotiation and bargaining processes. The first part of the paper contributes
to the definition of a robust (coalitional) TU game and the development of a
distributed bargaining protocol. We prove the convergence with probability 1 of
the bargaining process to a random allocation that lies in the core of the
robust game under some mild conditions on the underlying communication graphs.
The second part of the paper addresses the more general case where the robust
game may have empty core. In this case, with the dynamic game we associate a
dynamic average game by averaging over time the sequence of characteristic
functions. Then, we consider an accordingly modified bargaining protocol.
Assuming that the sequence of characteristic functions is ergodic and the core
of the average game has a nonempty relative interior, we show that the modified
bargaining protocol converges with probability 1 to a random allocation that
lies in the core of the average game.

screening masses through an Ansatz from the zero-temperature case. Going from
zero to nonzero temperature, we see that the longitudinal gluon propagator
DL(p) is enhanced, with an apparent plateau value in the infrared, while the
transverse propagator DT(p) gets progressively more infrared-suppressed, with a
clear turnover in momentum at all nonzero temperatures considered. Our data
allow us to associate what was previously seen as a peak in the infrared value
of DL(p) at Tc to severe finite-size effects along the temperature direction.
In particular, a temporal lattice extent Nt >= 8 seems to be needed to study
the electric sector around the transition. Once these systematic errors are
eliminated, the infrared behavior of the longitudinal propagator appears to be
rather independent of the temperature below the transition. Above Tc, the
infrared value of DL(p) starts to decrease monotonically with the temperature.

requirements are discussed in detail, and physically motivated scenarios are
highlighted in which each model can be considered a viable explanation for the

different motions, namely helical twist in the prominence spine, and overall
non-radial equatorward motion of the entire prominence structure. The sense of
twist in both the prominences is determined from the changes in latitudes and
longitudes of the reconstructed features. The prominences are observed starting
from a few hours before the eruption. Increase in height before and during the
eruption allowed us to study kinematics of the prominences in the two phases of
eruption, the slow rise and the fast eruptive phase. A constant value of
acceleration was found for each reconstructed feature in each phase, but it

V and VI clouds and discuss them in combination with near-infrared (2MASS)
data. Our observations complement those obtained for other Lupus clouds within
the frame of the Spitzer ""Core to Disk"" (c2d) Legacy Survey. We found 43 Young
Stellar Object (YSO) candidates in Lupus V and 45 in Lupus VI, including 2
transition disks, using the standard c2d/GB selection method. None of these
sources was classified as a pre-main sequence star from previous optical,
near-IR and X-ray surveys. A large majority of these YSO candidates appear to
be surrounded by thin disks (Class III; ~79% in Lupus V and ~87% in Lupus VI).
These Class III abundances differ significantly from those observed for the
other Lupus clouds and c2d/GB surveyed star-forming regions, where objects with
optically thick disks (Class II) dominate the young population. We investigate
various scenarios that can explain this discrepancy. In particular, we show
that disk photo-evaporation due to nearby OB stars is not responsible for the
high fraction of Class III objects. The gas surface densities measured for
Lupus V and VI lies below the star-formation threshold (AV {\eqsim}8.6 mag),
while this is not the case for other Lupus clouds. Thus, few Myrs older age for
the YSOs in Lupus V and VI with respect to other Lupus clouds is the most
likely explanation of the high fraction of Class III objects in these clouds,
while a higher characteristic stellar mass might be a contributing factor.

the combination of standard statistical techniques (Robust Principal Component
Analysis in one approach and wavelet decomposition and Independent Component
Analysis in the second) in order to obtain least biased samples. These
techniques are implemented in the spirit of letting the data speak for
themselves. The analysis is carried out for two spectral lines: the C IV line
at 1548.2 angstroms and the Ne VIII line at 770.4 angstroms. We find
significant differences between the characteristics of the line profiles
emitted in the proximities of two active regions, and in the quiet Sun, most
visible in the relative importance of a separate population of red shifted
profiles. We also find a higher frequency of explosive events near the active
regions, and in the C IV line. The distribution of the explosive events
characteristics is interpreted in the light of recent numerical simulations.
Finally, we point out several regions of the parameter space where the
reconnection model has to be refined in order to explain the observations.

simulation. Thanks to the use of maximally localized Wannier orbitals to
represent the electronic ground state of the simulated system, one is able to
quantify the redistribution of electronic density around oxygen atoms as a
function of the cationic environment and melt composition. It is shown that the
structure of the melt in the immediate vicinity of the oxygen atoms modulates
the distribution of the Wannier orbitals associated with oxygen atoms. In
particular the evaluation of the distances between the oxygen-core and the
orbital Wannier centers and their evolution with the nature of the cation
indicates that the Al-O bond in silicate melts is certainly less covalent than
the Si-O bond while for the series Mg-O, Ca-O, Na-O and K-O the covalent
character of the M-O bond diminishes rapidly to the benefit of the ionic
character. Furthermore it is found that the distribution of the oxygen dipole

representation of the CME magnetic field as an expanding spheromak
configuration, where the plasma heating is prescribed by the choice of
anomalous resistivity and the spheromak dynamics. We chose as a test case, the
19 May 2007 CME observed by STEREO and ACE. The spheromak is an appealing
physical model, because the location and degree of heating is fixed by the
choice of anomalous resistivity and the spheromak expansion rate which we
constrain with observations. This model can provide the heating required
between 1.1$R_{\sun}$ and earth orbit to produce charge states observed in the
CME flux rope. However this source of heating in the spheromak alone has
difficulty accounting for the rapid heating to Fe$^{8 - 11+}$ at lower heights,
as observed in STEREO EUVI due to the rapid radiative cooling that occurs at
the high densities involved. Episodes of heating and cooling clearly unrelated
to spheromak expansion are observed prior to the eruption, and presumably still
play a role during the eruption itself. Spheromak heating is also not capable
of reproducing the high Fe charge states (Fe$^{16+}$ and higher) seen in situ
exterior to the flux rope in this CME. Thus while the spheromak configuration
may be a valid model for the magnetic topology, other means of energization are
still required to provide much of the rapid heating observed.

self-similar (o.s.s.), Gaussian processes with stationary increments. They
generalize univariate fractional Brownian motions to the multivariate context.
It is well-known that the so-called symmetry group of an o.s.s. process is
conjugate to subgroups of the orthogonal group. Moreover, by a celebrated
result of Hudson and Mason, the set of all exponents of an operator
self-similar process can be related to the tangent space of its symmetry group.
  In this paper, we revisit and study both the symmetry groups and exponent
sets for the class of OFBMs based on their spectral domain integral
representations. A general description of the symmetry groups of OFBMs in terms
of subsets of centralizers of the spectral domain parameters is provided. OFBMs
with symmetry groups of maximal and minimal types are studied in any dimension.
In particular, it is shown that OFBMs have minimal symmetry groups (as thus,
unique exponents) in general, in the topological sense. Finer classification
results of OFBMs, based on the explicit construction of their symmetry groups,
are given in the lower dimensions 2 and 3. It is also shown that the
parametrization of spectral domain integral representations are, in a suitable

all geodesics are simple and closed with a common minimal period, such as the
3-sphere S^3 with canonical metric. In this work the global well-posedness
problem for the quintic nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation i\partial_t u+\Delta
u=\pm|u|^4u, u|_{t=0}=u_0 is solved for small initial data u_0 in the energy
space H^1(M), which is the scaling-critical space. Further, local
well-posedness for large data, as well as persistence of higher initial Sobolev
regularity is obtained. This extends previous results of Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov
to the endpoint case.

non-equilibrium steady states. We study here the steady-state entropy
production, both at short times as well as in the long-time limit, of two
important classes of non-equilibrium systems: transport systems and
reaction-diffusion systems. The usefulness of the mean entropy production rate
and of the large deviation function of the entropy production for
characterizing non-equilibrium steady states of interacting many-body systems
is discussed. We show that the large deviation function displays a kink-like
feature at zero entropy production that is similar to that observed for a
single particle driven along a periodic potential. This kink is a direct
consequence of the detailed fluctuation theorem fulfilled by the probability
distribution of the entropy production and is therefore a generic feature of
the corresponding large deviation function.

color anti-triplet diquark cluster consisting of double heavy quarks is formed
first from the produced double heavy quark-antiquark pairs via $gg$ fusion hard
process, followed by the fragmentation of the diquark cluster into a four-quark
(tetraquark) state. Predictions for the production cross sections and their
differential distributions are presented. Our results show that it is quite
promising to discover these tetraquark states in LHC experiments both for large
number events and for their unique signatures in detectors.

orbits starting from two short observed arcs of a celestial body, which may be
obtained either by optical or radar observations. We write polynomial equations
for this problem, that we can solve using the powerful tools of computational
Algebra. An algorithm to decide if the linkage of two short arcs is successful,
i.e. if they belong to the same observed body, is proposed and tested
numerically. In this paper we continue the research started in [Gronchi,
Dimare, Milani, 'Orbit determination with the two-body intergrals', CMDA (2010)
107/3, 299-318], where the angular momentum and the energy integrals were used.
A suitable component of the Laplace-Lenz vector in place of the energy turns
out to be convenient, in fact the degree of the resulting system is reduced to
less than half.

presented. As a test and first application of this model atom, Fe abundances
are determined for the Sun and five stars with well determined stellar
parameters and high-quality observed spectra. Non-LTE leads to systematically
depleted total absorption in the Fe I lines and to positive abundance
corrections in agreement with the previous studies, however, the magnitude of
non-LTE effect is smaller compared to the earlier results. Non-LTE corrections
do not exceed 0.1 dex for the solar metallicity and mildly metal-deficient
stars, and they vary within 0.21 dex and 0.35 dex in the very metal-poor stars
HD 84937 and HD 122563, respectively, depending on the assumed efficiency of
collisions with hydrogen atoms. Based on the analysis of the Fe I/Fe II
ionization equilibrium in these two stars, we recommend to apply the Drawin
formalism in non-LTE studies of Fe with a scaling factor of 0.1. For the Fe II
lines, non-LTE corrections do not exceed 0.01 dex in absolute value. The solar
non-LTE abundance obtained from 54 Fe I lines is 7.56+-0.09 and the abundance
from 18 Fe II lines varies between 7.41+-0.11 and 7.56+-0.05 depending on the
source of the gf-values. Thus, gf-values available for the iron lines are not
accurate enough to pursue high-accuracy absolute abundance determinations.
Lines of Fe I give, on average, a 0.1 dex lower abundance compared to those of
Fe II lines for HD 61421 and HD 102870, even when applying a differential
analysis relative to the Sun. A disparity between Fe I and Fe II points to
problems of stellar atmosphere modelling or/and effective temperature
determination.

trend to faster vortex lattice dynamics for increasing temperatures we observe
a dramatic changeover of the relaxation process associated with the non-trivial
vortex lattice morphology in the intermediate mixed state. This changeover is
attributed to a Landau-branching of the Shubnikov domains at the surface of the
sample. Our study represents a showcase for how to access directly vortex
lattice melting and the formation of vortex matter states for other systems.

of this system is that the high density of state is located in the vicinity of

relaxation rate 1/T_1 shows that the antiferromagnetic spin correlation is not
strong in this system, but it is reasonable to consider that its development
toward low temperatures occurs. 1/T_1 in the superconducting state can be
reproduced well by an s+- wave model, but a d wave model also roughly
reproduces the data. Non exponential behavior in 1/T_1 at low temperatures
disagrees with a single isotropic gap.

and transcriptional activation, allowing it to react to a wide spectrum of
environmental changes. High throughput experiments identify numerous molecular
components of such cascades that may, however, interact through unknown
partners. Some of them may be detected using data coming from the integration
of a protein-protein interaction network and mRNA expression profiles. This
inference problem can be mapped onto the problem of finding appropriate optimal
connected subgraphs of a network defined by these datasets. The optimization
procedure turns out to be computationally intractable in general. Here we
present a new distributed algorithm for this task, inspired from statistical
physics, and apply this scheme to alpha factor and drug perturbations data in
yeast. We identify the role of the COS8 protein, a member of a gene family of
previously unknown function, and validate the results by genetic experiments.
The algorithm we present is specially suited for very large datasets, can run
in parallel, and can be adapted to other problems in systems biology. On
renowned benchmarks it outperforms other algorithms in the field.
