As well, we describe the mechanism or rational factorizations of 2nd order

finish with the example of higher codimension generalization of Jacobi

these families have non-singular weights.

LQG, of three dimensional gravity in the case of positive cosmological constant
{\Lambda} and try to make contact with alternative quantization approaches
already existing in the literature. Due to the appearance of an anomaly in the
constraints algebra, previously studied as a first step of the analysis,
alternative techniques developed for the quantization of systems with
constraints algebras not associated with a structure Lie group need to be
adopted. Therefore, I introduce an ansatz for a physical state which gives some
transition amplitudes in agreement with what one would expect from the
Turaev-Viro model. Moreover, in order to check that this state implements the
right dynamicss, I show that it annihilates the master constraint for the
theory up to the first order in {\Lambda}.

neutral atoms in the emblematic strongly correlated quantum Hall regime. The
routes followed so far essentially rely on thermodynamics, i.e. imposing the
proper Hamiltonian and cooling the system towards its ground state. In rapidly
rotating 2D harmonic traps the role of the transverse magnetic field is played
by the angular velocity. For particle numbers significantly larger than unity,
the required angular momentum is very large and it can be obtained only for
spinning frequencies extremely near to the deconfinement limit; consequently,
the required control on experimental parameters turns out to be far too
stringent. Here we propose to follow instead a dynamic path starting from the
gas confined in a rotating ring. The large moment of inertia of the fluid
facilitates the access to states with a large angular momentum, corresponding
to a giant vortex. The initial ring-shaped trapping potential is then
adiabatically transformed into a harmonic confinement, which brings the
interacting atomic gas in the desired quantum Hall regime. We provide clear
numerical evidence that for a relatively broad range of initial angular
frequencies, the giant vortex state is adiabatically connected to the bosonic
$\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state, and we discuss the scaling to many particles.

fusion process, since it is the leading mechanism for the Higgs boson
production. The gap survival probability is also introduced to include the
rescattering corrections due to spectator particles present in the interaction.
The diffractive ratios are predicted for proton-proton collisions at the LHC,
since the beam luminosity is favorable to the Higgs boson detection. These
results provide updated estimations for the fraction of single and central

theoretical possibility that a significantly large number of up, down, and
strange quarks may settle down in a new state of matter known as strange quark
matter, which, by hypothesis, could be more stable than atomic nuclei. In the
latter case new classes of self-bound, color superconducting objects, ranging
from strange quark nuggets to strange quark stars, should exist. The properties
of such objects will be reviewed along with the possible existence of
deconfined quarks in neutron stars. Implications for observational astrophysics

problems and as moments of orthogonal polynomials. We begin this article with a
new combinatorial approach to prove these kind of formulas, related with
integer partitions. This gives a new perspective on the original result of
Touchard and Riordan. But the main goal is to give a combinatorial proof of a
Touchard-Riordan--like formula for q-secant numbers discovered by the first
author. An interesting limit case of these objects can be directly interpreted
in terms of partitions, so that we obtain a connection between the formula for
q-secant numbers, and a particular case of Jacobi's triple product identity.
  Building on this particular case, we obtain a ""finite version"" of the triple
product identity. It is in the form of a finite sum which is given a
combinatorial meaning, so that the triple product identity can be obtained by
taking the limit. Here the proof is non-combinatorial and relies on a
functional equation satisfied by a T-fraction. Then from this result on the
triple product identity, we derive a whole new family of Touchard-Riordan--like
formulas whose combinatorics is not yet understood. Eventually, we prove a
Touchard-Riordan--like formula for a q-analog of Genocchi numbers, which is
related with Jacobi's identity for (q;q)^3 rather than the triple product
identity.

is the first case where an X-ray afterglow has been observed associated with a
short gamma-ray burst (GRB). Within the fireshell model, the canonical GRB
light curve presents two different components: the proper-GRB (P-GRB) and the
extended afterglow. [...] In particular, the traditionally called short GRBs
can be either ""genuine"" short GRBs [...] or ""disguised"" short GRBs [...]. AIMS:
We verify whether GRB 050509b can be classified as a ""genuine"" short or a
""disguised"" short GRB, in the fireshell model. Methods: We investigate two
alternative scenarios. In the first, we start from the assumption that this GRB
is a ""genuine"" short burst. In the second attempt, we assume that this GRB is a
""disguised"" burst. Results: If GRB 050509b were a genuine short GRB, there
should initially be very hard emission which is ruled out by the observations.
The analysis that assumes that this is a disguised short GRB is compatible with
the observations. The theoretical model predicts a value of the extended
afterglow energy peak that is consistent with the Amati relation. Conclusions:
GRB 050509b cannot be classified as a ""genuine"" short GRB. The observational
data are consistent with a ""disguised"" short GRB classification, i.e., a long
burst with a weak extended afterglow ""deflated"" by the low density of the CBM.
We expect that all short GRBs with measured redshifts are disguised short GRBs
because of a selection effect: if there is enough energy in the afterglow to
measure the redshift, then the proper GRB must be less energetic than the
afterglow. The Amati relation is found to be fulfilled only by the extended
afterglow excluding the P-GRB.

good (service) to consumers that are embedded in a social network. A key
feature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network
effect. In particular, each consumer's usage level depends directly on the
usage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist's
optimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents, who
have a central position in the underlying network.
  First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized
prices and derive an explicit characterization of the optimal price for each
consumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it
is optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that is proportional
to her Bonacich centrality in the social network. In the second part of the
paper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist that can only choose a
single uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the
number of agents to compute such a price. Thirdly, we assume that the
monopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and study the
problem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We
show that the problem is NP-hard, however we provide an explicit
characterization of the set of agents that should be offered the discounted
price. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set
of agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price
allocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit.
Finally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits
of a monopolist that does not take into account the network effects when
choosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist that uses this information
optimally.

eccentric, with 0.0012 < e < 0.070 (3 sigma). Such a low eccentricity suggests
that, under current models, tidal heating alone could not have bloated the

favourable outcomes can occur both in the presence and the absence of a large
Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) D-term associated with the new U(1). We explore the
cosmological consequences of the model, showing that it naturally produces a
period of hybrid inflation, terminating in the production of cosmic strings. In
spite of the presence of a U(1) (even with an FI term), inflation is effected
by the F-term, with a D-flat tree potential (the FI term, if present, being
cancelled by non-zero squark and slepton fields). Calculating the 1-loop
corrections to the inflaton potential, we estimate the constraints on the
parameters of the model from Cosmic Microwave Background data. We will see that
a consequence of these constraints is that the Higgs mu-term necessarily small.

leptogenesis, the out-of-equilibrium production of neutrinos from the cosmic

the AGN in luminous quasars substantially contribute to L_FIR, we study the
L'(CO)-L_FIR relation for quasars relative to galaxies without a luminous AGN
as a function of redshift. We find no substantial differences between
submillimeter galaxies and high-z quasars, but marginal evidence for an excess
in L_FIR in nearby low-L_FIR AGN galaxies. This may suggest that an AGN
contribution to L_FIR is significant in systems with relatively low gas and
dust content, but only minor in the most far-infrared-luminous galaxies (in
which L_FIR is dominated by star formation).

on the cosmological scale. The experimental method uses two atom
interferometers to cancel the effect of earth's gravity and diverse noise
sources. It depends upon two assumptions: first, that the DCV possesses some
space inhomogeneity in density, and second that it exerts a sufficiently strong
non-gravitational force on matter. The motion of the apparatus through the DCV
should then lead to an irregular variation in the detected matter-wave phase
shift. We discuss the nature of this signal and note the problem of
distinguishing it from instrumental noise. We also discuss the relation of our

detectors such as LIGO.The paper concludes with a projection that a future

entering a nonlinear transport regime. This field depends on the lattice
temperature, electron density, impurity scattering strength, nanoribbon width
and correlation length for the line-edge roughness. An enhanced electron
mobility beyond this threshold has been observed, which is related to the
initially-heated electrons in high energy states with a larger group velocity.
However, this mobility enhancement quickly reaches a maximum due to the Fermi
velocity in graphene and the dramatically increased phonon scattering.
Super-linear and sub-linear temperature dependence of mobility seen in the
linear and nonlinear transport regimes. By analyzing the calculated
non-equilibrium electron distribution function, this difference is attributed
separately to the results of sweeping electrons from the right Fermi edge to
the left one through the elastic scattering and moving electrons from
low-energy states to high-energy ones through field-induced electron heating.
The threshold field is pushed up by a decreased correlation length in the high
field regime, and is further accompanied by a reduced magnitude in the mobility
enhancement. This implies an anomalous high-field increase of the line-edge
roughness scattering with decreasing correlation length due to the occupation
of high-energy states by field-induced electron heating.

strategies for in situ, real-time active sampling. To ease this computational

analyze the time complexity of solving the Markov-based path planning problem,
and demonstrate analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the
non-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon. For a
class of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task, we provide
theoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based
policy, from which ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task
settings can be established to limit its performance degradation due to
violation of the Markov assumption. Empirical evaluation on real-world
temperature and plankton density field data shows that our Markov-based policy
can generally achieve active sampling performance comparable to that of the
widely-used non-Markovian greedy policies under less favorable realistic field

statistical ensemble of volume and stress fluctuations through the
thermodynamic notion of entropy, compactivity, X, and angoricity, A (two
temperature-like variables). We find that Edwards thermodynamics is able to
describe the jamming transition (J-point). Using the ensemble formalism we
elucidate the following: (i)We test the combined volume-stress ensemble by
comparing the statistical properties of jammed configurations obtained by
dynamics with those averaged over the ensemble of minima in the potential
energy landscape as a test of ergodicity. Agreement between both methods
supports the idea of ""thermalization"" at a given angoricity and compactivity.
(ii) A microcanonical ensemble analysis supports the idea of maximum entropy
principle for grains. (iii) The intensive variables describe the approach to
jamming through a series of scaling relations as A {\to} 0+ and X {\to} 0-. Due
to the force-volume coupling, the jamming transition can be probed
thermodynamically by a ""jamming temperature"" TJ comprised of contributions from
A and X. (iv) The thermodynamic framework reveals the order of the jamming
phase transition by showing the absence of critical fluctuations at jamming in
observables like pressure and volume. (v) Finally, we elaborate on a comparison

of discrete pebbles can satisfy a given demand via pebbling moves. A pebbling
move across an edge of a graph takes two pebbles from one endpoint and places
one pebble at the other endpoint; the other pebble is lost in transit as a
toll. It has been shown that deciding whether a supply can meet a demand on a
graph is NP-complete. The pebbling number of a graph is the smallest t such
that every supply of t pebbles can satisfy every demand of one pebble. Deciding
if the pebbling number is at most k is \Pi_2^P-complete. In this paper we
develop a tool, called the Weight Function Lemma, for computing upper bounds
and sometimes exact values for pebbling numbers with the assistance of linear
optimization. With this tool we are able to calculate the pebbling numbers of
much larger graphs than in previous algorithms, and much more quickly as well.
We also obtain results for many families of graphs, in many cases by hand, with
much simpler and remarkably shorter proofs than given in previously existing
arguments (certificates typically of size at most the number of vertices times
the maximum degree), especially for highly symmetric graphs. Here we apply the
Weight Function Lemma to several specific graphs, including the Petersen,
Lemke, 4th weak Bruhat, Lemke squared, and two random graphs, as well as to a
number of infinite families of graphs, such as trees, cycles, graph powers of
cycles, cubes, and some generalized Petersen and Coxeter graphs. This partly
answers a question of Pachter, et al., by computing the pebbling exponent of
cycles to within an asymptotically small range. It is conceivable that this
method yields an approximation algorithm for graph pebbling.

Difficulty correlating the behaviors with observations of the inhomogeneities
make these connections uncertain. Of primary interest here are proposals that
insulating films near the IST, which show an activated resistance and giant
positive magnetoresistance, contain islands of Cooper Pairs (CPs). Here we
present evidence that these types of inhomogeneities are essential to such an
insulating phase in amorphous Bi (a-Bi) films deposited on substrates patterned
with nanometer-sized holes. The patterning induces film thickness variations,
and corresponding coupling constant variations, that transform the composition
of the insulator from localized electrons to CPs. Analyses near the
thickness-tuned ISTs of films on nine different substrates show that weak links
between SC islands dominate the transport. In particular, the ISTs all occur
when the link resistance approaches the resistance quantum for pairs. These
observations lead to a detailed picture of CPs localized by spatial variations
of the superconducting coupling constant.

23 solar mass star, close to core collapse (about 1 hour, in 1D), with
simultaneously active C, Ne, O, and Si burning shells, are presented and
contrasted to existing 1D models (which are forced to be quasi-static).
Pronounced asymmetries, and strong dynamical interactions between shells are
seen in 2D. Although instigated by turbulence, the dynamic behavior proceeds to
sufficiently large amplitudes that it couples to the nuclear burning. Dramatic
growth of low order modes is seen, as well as large deviations from spherical
symmetry in the burning shells. The vigorous dynamics is more violent than that
seen in earlier burning stages in the 3D simulations of a single cell in the
oxygen burning shell, or in 2D simulations not including an active Si shell.
Linear perturbative analysis does not capture the chaotic behavior of
turbulence (e.g., strange attractors such as that discovered by Lorenz), and
therefore badly underestimates the vigor of the instability. The limitations of
1D and 2D models are discussed in detail. The 2D models, although flawed
geometrically, represent a more realistic treatment of the relevant dynamics
than existing 1D models, and present a dramatically different view of the
stages of evolution prior to collapse. Implications for interpretation of
SN1987A, abundances in young supernova remnants, pre-collapse outbursts,
progenitor structure, neutron star kicks, and fallback are outlined. While 2D
simulations provide new qualitative insight, fully 3D simulations are needed
for a quantitative understanding of this stage of stellar evolution. The
necessary properties of such simulations are delineated.

phenomenal sensitivity and stability of Spitzer at these bands has enabled
several dedicated monitoring programs studying the variability of young stars

observationally. In general, observational approaches to galaxy formation
include measuring basic galaxy properties, such as luminosities, stellar
masses, rotation speeds, star formation rates and how these features evolve
through time. Theoretically, cosmologically based models collate the physical
effects driving galaxy assembly - mergers of galaxies, accretion of gas, star
formation, and feedback, amongst others, to form predictions which are matched
to galaxy observables. An alternative approach is to examine directly, in an
observational way, the processes driving galaxy assembly, including the effects
of feedback. This is a new `third way' towards understanding how galaxies are
forming from gas accretion and mergers, and directly probes these effects
instead of relying on simulations designed to reproduce observations. This
empirical approach towards understanding galaxy formation, including the
acquisition history of baryons, displays some significant differences with the
latest galaxy formation models, in addition to directly demonstrating the
mechanisms by which galaxies form most of their baryonic mass.

theory, i.e. using the new exchange-correlation functionals optPBE-vdW and
vdW-DF2. Inclusion of the more isotropic vdW interactions counteracts highly
directional hydrogen-bonds, which are enhanced by standard functionals. This
brings about a softening of the microscopic structure of water, as seen from
the broadening of angular distribution functions and, in particular, from the
much lower and broader first peak in the oxygen-oxygen pair-correlation
function (PCF), indicating loss of structure in the outer solvation shells. In
combination with softer non-local correlation terms, as in the new
parameterization of vdW-DF, inclusion of vdW interactions is shown to shift the

linear combinations of a small set of atoms selected from a given dictionary
has had dramatic impact on the theory and practice of signal processing. For
practical problems in which an appropriate sparsifying dictionary is not known
ahead of time, a very popular and successful heuristic is to search for a
dictionary that minimizes an appropriate sparsity surrogate over a given set of
sample data. While this idea is appealing, the behavior of these algorithms is
largely a mystery; although there is a body of empirical evidence suggesting
they do learn very effective representations, there is little theory to
guarantee when they will behave correctly, or when the learned dictionary can
be expected to generalize. In this paper, we take a step towards such a theory.
We show that under mild hypotheses, the dictionary learning problem is locally
well-posed: the desired solution is indeed a local minimum of the $\ell^1$
norm. Namely, if $\mb A \in \Re^{m \times n}$ is an incoherent (and possibly
overcomplete) dictionary, and the coefficients $\mb X \in \Re^{n \times p}$
follow a random sparse model, then with high probability $(\mb A,\mb X)$ is a
local minimum of the $\ell^1$ norm over the manifold of factorizations $(\mb
A',\mb X')$ satisfying $\mb A' \mb X' = \mb Y$, provided the number of samples
$p = \Omega(n^3 k)$. For overcomplete $\mb A$, this is the first result showing
that the dictionary learning problem is locally solvable. Our analysis draws on
tools developed for the problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a small
subset of its entries, which allow us to overcome a number of technical
obstacles; in particular, the absence of the restricted isometry property.

investigate the occurrence of TI in the molecular clouds. Then, for studying
the significance of linear isobaric TI, we use a contracting axisymmetric
cylindrical core with axial magnetic field. Consideration to cooling and
heating mechanisms in the molecular clouds shows that including the heating due
to ambipolar diffusion can lead to the occurrence of TI in a time-scale smaller
than dynamical time-scale. Application of linear perturbation analysis shows
that isobaric TI can take place in outer region of the molecular cloud cores.
Furthermore, the results showthat perturbations with wavelengths greater than
few astronomical units are protected from destabilization property of thermal
conduction, so they can grow to form LMCs. Thus, the results show that the
mechanism of TI can be used to explain the formation of LMCs as the progenitors
of collapsing proto-stellar entities, brown dwarfs, or proto-planets.

challenging problem with numerous applications. The problem is usually
approached by computing local descriptors on a pair of shapes and then
establishing a point-wise correspondence between the two. In this paper, we
introduce an alternative correspondence-less approach to matching fragments to
an entire shape undergoing a non-rigid deformation. We use diffusion geometric
descriptors and optimize over the integration domains on which the integral
descriptors of the two parts match. The problem is regularized using the
Mumford-Shah functional. We show an efficient discretization based on the
Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation generalized to triangular meshes. Experiments
demonstrating the success of the proposed method are presented.

associative normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers and
the quaternions. Indeed, these three choices appear naturally in a number of
axiomatic approaches. However, there are internal problems with real or
quaternionic quantum theory. Here we argue that these problems can be resolved
if we treat real, complex and quaternionic quantum theory as part of a unified
structure. Dyson called this structure the ""three-fold way"". It is perhaps
easiest to see it in the study of irreducible unitary representations of groups
on complex Hilbert spaces. These representations come in three kinds: those
that are not isomorphic to their own dual (the truly ""complex""
representations), those that are self-dual thanks to a symmetric bilinear
pairing (which are ""real"", in that they are the complexifications of
representations on real Hilbert spaces), and those that are self-dual thanks to
an antisymmetric bilinear pairing (which are ""quaternionic"", in that they are
the underlying complex representations of representations on quaternionic
Hilbert spaces). This three-fold classification sheds light on the physics of
time reversal symmetry, and it already plays an important role in particle
physics. More generally, Hilbert spaces of any one of the three kinds - real,
complex and quaternionic - can be seen as Hilbert spaces of the other kinds,
equipped with extra structure.

of the fluid material element on the Bernoulli surface, whereas some new exact

a continued typhoon-like vortex solution, where there are two intrinsic length
scales. One is the radius of maximum circular velocity $r_m$, the other is the
radius of the vortex kernel $r_k=\sqrt{2}r_m$. The second one is a multi-planar

umbrella vortex similar to the first one. The third one is also a multi-planar

independent solutions like the Rankine vortex, which is also finite but
discontinued for either vertical or horizontal velocity. The fourth one is a
multi-paraboloid vortex solution finite for $z$-coordinate but infinite for
$r$-coordinate. Besides, some classical simple solutions (Rankine vortex,
Batchelor vortex, Hill spherical vortex, etc.) were also obtained. The above

superfluid at unitary in terms of the Fermi energy $\epsilon_{\text F}$
according to recent experimental results in LKB-Lhomond. Based on the universal
equations of state for the superfluid and normal phases, we show that there
exist two critical fields $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$, between which a
superfluid-normal mixed phase is energetically favored. Universal formulae for
the critical fields and the critical population imbalance $P_c$ are derived. We
have found a universal relation between the critical fields and the critical
imbalances: $H_{c1}=\gamma\xi\epsilon_{\text F}$ and $H_{c2}=(1+\gamma
P_c)^{2/3}H_{c1}$ where $\xi$ is the universal constant and $\gamma$ is the
critical value of the chemical potential imbalance in the grand canonical
ensemble. Since $\xi$, $\gamma$ and $P_c$ have been measured in the
experiments, we can determine the critical Zeeman fields without the detail
information of the equation of state for the polarized normal phase. Using the
experimental data from LKB-Lhomond, we have found
$H_{c1}\simeq0.37\epsilon_{\text F}$ and $H_{c2}\simeq0.44\epsilon_{\text F}$.
Our result of the polarization $P$ as a function of the Zeeman field
$H/\epsilon_{\text F}$ is in good agreement with the data extracted from the
experiments. We also give an estimation of the critical magnetic field for
dilute neutron matter at which the matter gets spin polarized, assuming the
properties of the dilute neutron matter are close to those of the unitary Fermi
gas.

identified with the amount of 'tilting' of the brane. The cosmological constant
is found to coincide with the classic Randall-Sundrum value to first order in
this tilt. Lorentz violating effects induced in the Standard Model are
considered. We find that the strongest constraint on the tilt comes from
determinations of the electron-proton mass ratio in six quasar spectra (four

equivalent to making the natural convolution multiplication on $\ell_1(\Z)$
separately weak*-continuous and so turning $\ell_1(\Z)$ into a dual Banach

only shift-invariant predual arising from the standard duality between $C_0(K)$

show that merely as Banach spaces, these are all isomorphic to $c_0$. We then
build some theory to study such preduals, showing that they arise from certain
semigroup compactifications of $\Z$. This allows us to produce a large number

scheme requires two features: The detection events must take place in the
middle of the gate, and the detector must be single-photon sensitive. Here we
present a technique called bit-mapped gating, which is an elegant way to force
the detections in the middle of the detector gate by coupling detection time
and quantum bit error rate. We also discuss how to guarantee single-photon
sensitivity by directly measuring detector parameters. Bit-mapped gating also
provides a simple way to measure the detector blinding parameter in security
proofs for quantum key distribution systems with detector efficiency mismatch,
which up until now has remained a theoretical, unmeasurable quantity. Thus if
single-photon sensitivity can be guaranteed within the gates, a detection
scheme with bit-mapped gating satisfies the assumptions of the current security
proofs.
