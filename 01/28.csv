observationally inaccessible correlators. We apply our formalism to a
renormalised interacting quantum field theoretical model. Using
out-of-equilibrium field theory techniques we show that the Gaussian von
Neumann entropy for a pure quantum state increases to the interacting thermal
entropy. This quantifies decoherence and thus measures how classical our pure
state has become. The decoherence rate is equal to the single particle decay
rate in our model. We also compare our approach to existing approaches to
decoherence in a simple quantum mechanical model. We show that the entropy
following from the perturbative master equation suffers from physically
unacceptable secular growth.

hierarchically: commands are sent down the hierarchy and state changes are sent
upwards. The sheer size of the system makes it virtually impossible to fully
understand the details of its behaviour at the macro level. This is fuelled by
unclarities that already exist at the micro level. We have solved the latter
problem by formally describing the finite state machines in the mCRL2 process

visualisations of individual finite state machines and through formal
verification of subsystems of the control software. Based on the formalised

from the start of science operations of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in
2008 August until 2009 September, and then became more active, with gradually
increasing flux and some moderately-bright flares. In 2010 April and June, 4C
+21.35 underwent a very strong GeV outburst composed of several major flares
characterized by rise and decay timescales of the order of a day. During the
outburst, the GeV spectra of 4C +21.35 displayed a broken power-law form with
spectral breaks observed near 1-3 GeV photon energies. We demonstrate that, at
least during the major flares, the jet in 4C +21.35 carried a total kinetic
luminosity comparable to the total accretion power available to feed the
outflow. We also discuss the origin of the break observed in the flaring
spectra of 4C +21.35. We show that, in principle, a model involving
annihilation of the GeV photons on the He II Lyman recombination continuum and
line emission of ""broad line region"" clouds may account for such. However, we
also discuss the additional constraint provided by the detection of 4C +21.35
at 0.07-0.4 TeV energies by the MAGIC telescope, which coincided with one of
the GeV flares of the source. We argue that there are reasons to believe that
the $lesssim$,TeV emission of 4C +21.35 (as well as the GeV emission of the
source, if co-spatial), is not likely to be produced inside the broad line
region zone of highest ionization ($sim 10^{17}$,cm from the nucleus), but
instead originates further away from the active center, namely around the
characteristic scale of the hot dusty torus surrounding the 4C +21.35 nucleus

for sufficient strengths, these two competing effects can lead to amplitude
death. We provide a general stability analysis that gives the threshold values
for onset of amplitude death. We study in detail the nature of the transition
to death in several specific cases and find that the transitions can be of two
types - continuous and discontinuous. By choosing a variety of dynamics for
example, periodic, chaotic, hyper chaotic, and time-delay systems, we
illustrate that this mechanism is quite general and works for different types
of direct coupling, such as diffusive, replacement, and synaptic couplings and
for different damped dynamics of the environment.

technique for the specification of communicative interactions between the IS

non-bending, non-decelerating model, by using superluminal parsec scale speeds
along with parameters derived from the inverse Compton X-ray model. We use
these angles to calculate best fit Doppler and bulk Lorentz factors for the

material. We find that the progenitor of PSR J1713+0747 can be modelled as an
LMXB including a donor star with mass $1.3-1.6 M_{\odot}$ and an initial
orbital period ranging from 2.40 to 4.15 days. If the cooling timescale of the
WD is 8 Gyr, its present effective temperature is between 3870 and 4120 K,
slightly higher than the observed value. We estimate a surface gravity of ${\rm

contrasts with classical probabilistic finite automata, whose sensitivity to
changes in a coin's bias is bounded by a classic 1970 result of Hellman and

quantum polynomial-space machines with advice coins. Our main theorem is that
both classes coincide with PSPACE/poly. Proving this result turns out to
require substantial machinery. We use an algorithm due to Neff for finding

the scalar susceptibility difference $\chi(T)-\chi(0)$, directly measurable on
the lattice. This sum rule is useful also for estimating condensate errors in
staggered lattice analysis. Keeping $m_u\neq m_d$ allows to obtain the
connected and disconnected contributions to the susceptibility, even in the
isospin limit, whose temperature, mass and isospin breaking dependence we
analyze in detail. The disconnected part grows linearly, diverging in the
chiral (infrared) limit as $T/M_\pi$, while the connected part shows a
quadratic behaviour, infrared regular as $T^2/M_\eta^2$ and coming from
$\pi^0\eta$ mixing terms. This smooth connected behaviour suggests that isospin
breaking correlations are weaker than critical chiral ones near the transition
temperature. We explore some consequences in connection with lattice data and
their scaling properties, for which our present analysis for physical masses,

placed in a vertically vibrated shallow box, there is spontaneous segregation.
Once the system is at least partly segregated and clusters of the heavy
particles have formed, there are sudden peaks of the horizontal kinetic energy
of the heavy particles, that is otherwise small. Together with the energy peaks
the clusters rapidly expand and the segregation is partially lost. The process
repeats once segregation has taken place again. Depending on the experimental
or numerical parameters, the energy bursts can occur either randomly or with
some regularity in time. An explanation for these events is provided based on
the existence of a fixed point for an isolated particle bouncing with only
vertical motion. The horizontal energy peaks occur when the energy stored in
the vertical motion is partly transferred into horizontal energy through a
chain reaction of collisions between heavy particles. A necessary condition for
the observed regularity of the events is that chain reactions involve most of
the heavy particles.

performed on a Genome Analyzer platform (Illumina), this study compared the
viral populations within two bovine epithelial samples (foot lesions) from a
single animal with the Inoculum used to initiate experimental infection.
Genomic sequences were determined in duplicate sequencing runs, and the
consensus sequence determined by NGS, for the Inoculum, was identical to that
previously determined using the Sanger method. However, NGS reveals the fine
polymorphic sub-structure of the viral population, from nucleotide variants
present at just below 50% frequency to those present at fractions of 1%. Some
of the higher frequency polymorphisms identified encoded changes within codons
associated with heparan sulphate binding and were present in both feet lesions
revealing intermediate stages in the evolution of a tissue-culture adapted
virus replicating within a mammalian host. We identified 2,622, 1,434 and 1,703
polymorphisms in the Inoculum, and in the two foot lesions respectively: most
of the substitutions occurred only in a small fraction of the population and
represent the progeny from recent cellular replication prior to onset of any
selective pressures. We estimated an upper limit for the genome-wide mutation
rate of the virus within a cell to be 7.8 x 10-4 per nt. The greater depth of
detection, achieved by NGS, demonstrates that this method is a powerful and

only. We show that jet schemes can be interpreted as advect-and-project

functional. Furthermore, this function space framework makes it possible to
systematically inherit update rules for the higher derivatives from the ODE

supplemented with auxiliary data structures occupying $O(n) + O(d \log

query algorithm for our wildcard index is faster than previous approaches using
reasonable working space. More importantly our new algorithm greatly reduces
the query working space to $O(d m + m \log n)$ bits. We note that compared to

There are, however, very few cases of relatively bright (and/or close) RSNe,
from which the expansion of the shock and the radio light curves at several
frequencies have been monitored covering several years. Applying the standard
model of radio emission from supernovae, it is possible to relate the defining

the flux-density decay rate of RSNe for a set of plausible/realistic values of

estimate the magnetic fields of different RSNe observed to date and compare

parameter space using fully coherent matched-filtering is computationally
prohibitive. Thus more efficient, so-called hierarchical techniques are
essential. Traditionally, the standard hierarchical approach consists of
dividing the data into nonoverlapping segments of which each is coherently
analyzed and subsequently the matched-filter outputs from all segments are
combined incoherently. The present work proposes to break the data into
subsegments shorter than the desired maximum coherence time span (size of the
coherence window). Then matched-filter outputs from the different subsegments
are efficiently combined by sliding the coherence window in time: Subsegments
whose timestamps are closer than coherence window size are combined coherently,
otherwise incoherently. Compared to the standard scheme at the same coherence
time baseline, data sets longer by about 50-100% would have to be analyzed to
achieve the same search sensitivity as with the sliding coherence window
approach. Numerical simulations attest to the analytically estimated
improvement.

star-forming galaxies out to high redshifts. Today's massive starbursts are
characterized by star formation rates (SFRs) of 100+ Mo/yr and display a
chaotic morphology and nucleated star formation indicative of a major merger.
At z~2, galaxies of similar mass and SFR are characterized by ordered rotation
and distributed star formation. The emerging cold accretion paradigm provides
an intuitive understanding for such differences. In it, halo accretion rates
govern the supply of gas into star-forming regions, modulated by strong
outflows. The high accretion rates at high-z drive more rapid star formation,
while also making disks thicker and clumpier; the clumps are expected to be
short-lived in the presence of strong galactic outflows as observed. Hence
equivalently rapid star-formers at high redshift are not analogous to local
merger-driven starbursts, but rather to local disks with highly enhanced
accretion rates.

theoretical and numerical works on the problem have considered small
aspect-ratio systems subjected to periodic boundary conditions, while
experiments correspond to the opposite limit of large aspect-ratio. Here, by
means of fully resolved direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes
equations at decreasing R, we scrutinize the transition from temporal to
spatiotemporal behavior in systems of intermediate sizes. We show that there
exists a streamwise crossover size of order L_x~70-80h (where 2h is the gap
between the plates driving the flow) beyond which the transition to/from
turbulence in PCF is undoubtedly a spatiotemporal process, with typical
scenario `[turbulent flow]->[riddled regime]->[oblique pattern]->[laminar
flow]', whereas below that size it is more a temporal process describable in
terms of finite-dimensional dynamical systems with scenario `[chaotic
flow]->[laminar flow]' (via chaotic transients). In the crossover region, the
`[oblique pattern]' stage is skipped, which leads us to suggest that an
appropriate rendering of the patterns observed in experiments needs a faithful
account of streamwise correlations at scales at least of the order of that

representation (both specified by the labels of the restricted Schur
polynomial). We give an explicit construction of these projectors by reducing
it to the simple problem of addition of angular momentum in ordinary

recursion relations have only three terms is a direct consequence of the weak
mixing at one loop of the restricted Schur polynomials. The recursion relations

Here, we discuss how different computing technologies can contribute to
providing the necessary self-organising features, including Multi-Agent Systems

these features may assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising

will be aided by consideration of the sudden increase in signal variance at the

detection prospects. Our analysis accounts for the possibility of narrow
absorption lines from intervening dense regions, but, unlike previous studies,
our results do not depend on their properties. Assuming x-ray heating
corresponding to a local stellar population, we estimate that a statistically
significant detection of 21cm absorption could be made by SKA in less than a

the usual enhancement, may show also a suppression (a dip-like aspect) which

relies on efficient confinement of high-energy ions produced by the fusion
reaction. Such particles can excite Alfven Eigenmodes (AEs), which
significantly degrade their confinement and threatens the vacuum vessel of
future reactors. To develop diagnostics and control schemes, a better
understanding of linear and nonlinear features of resonant interactions between
plasma waves and high-energy particles, is required. In the case of an isolated
single resonance, the problem is homothetic to the so-called Berk-Breizman (BB)
problem, which is an extension of the classic bump-on-tail electrostatic
problem, including external damping to a thermal plasma, and collisions. A
semi-Lagrangian simulation code, COBBLES, is developed to solve the
initial-value BB problem. The nonlinear behavior of instabilities in
experimentally-relevant conditions is categorized into steady-state, periodic,
chaotic, and frequency-sweeping (chirping) regimes. The chaotic regime is shown
to extend into a linearly stable region, and a mechanism for such subcritical
instabilities is proposed. Analytic and semi-empirical laws for nonlinear
chirping characteristics, such as sweeping-rate, lifetime, and asymmetry, are
developed and validated. Long-time simulations demonstrate the existence of a
quasi-periodic chirping regime. Collisional drag and diffusion are shown to be
essential to reproduce the alternation between major chirping events and
quiescent phases, which is observed in experiments. Based on these findings, a
fitting procedure between COBBLES simulations and chirping AE experiments is
developped. This procedure, which yields local linear drive and external
damping rate, is applied to Toroidicity-induced AEs (TAEs) on JT-60U and MAST
tokamaks. This suggests the existence of TAEs relatively far from marginal
stability.

  The quadrature points are constructed by lifting a $(0,m,2)$-net given in the

preserving map. A similar approach has previously been suggested by Cui and
Freeden [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 18 (1997), no. 2].
  We prove three results. The first one is that the construction is (almost)
optimal with respect to discrepancies based on spherical rectangles. Further we
prove that the point set is asymptotically uniformly distributed on
$\mathbb{S}^2$. And finally, we prove an upper bound on the spherical cap
$L_2$-discrepancy of order $N^{-1/2} (\log N)^{1/2}$ (where $N$ denotes the
number of points). This slightly improves upon the bound on the spherical cap
$L_2$-discrepancy of the construction by Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak [Comm.

Starting from any feasible probability measure $\nu$ on the Cantor space $\C$
and any suitable complexity class $C \subseteq \C$, the theory identifies the
subsets of $\C$ that are $\nu$-measurable in $C$ and assigns measures to these
sets, thereby endowing $C$ with internal measure-theoretic structure. Classes
to which the theory applies include various exponential time and space
complexity classes, the class of all decidable languages, and the Cantor space
itself, on which the resource-bounded theory is shown to agree with the
classical theory.
  The sets that are $\nu$-measurable in $C$ are shown to form an algebra
relative to which $\nu$-measure is well-behaved. This algebra is also shown to
be complete and closed under sufficiently uniform infinitary unions and
intersections, and $\nu$-measure in $C$ is shown to have the appropriate
additivity and monotone convergence properties with respect to such infinitary
operations.
  A generalization of the classical Kolmogorov zero-one law is proven, showing
that when $\nu$ is any feasible coin-toss probability measure on $\C$, every
set that is $\nu$-measurable in $C$ and (like most complexity classes)
invariant under finite alterations must have $\nu$-measure 0 or $\nu$-measure 1
in $C$.
  The theory is presented here is based on resource-bounded martingale
splitting operators, which are type-2 functionals, each of which maps $\N
\times {\cal D}_\nu$ into ${\cal D}_\nu \times {\cal D}_\nu$, where ${\cal
D}_\nu$ is the set of all $\nu$-martingales. This type-2 aspect of the theory
appears to be essential for general $\nu$-measure in complexity classes $C$,
but the sets of $\nu$-measure 0 or 1 in C are shown to be characterized by the
success conditions for martingales (type-1 functions) that have been used in
resource-bounded measure to date.

the dynamically generated mass analytically as well as numerically. We also
derive the scaling laws for the dynamical mass as a function of $\alpha$ and
$N_f$. Up to a multiplicative constant, these scaling laws are related through
$(\alpha, \alpha_c) \leftrightarrow (1/N_f, 1/N_f^c)$. Calculation of the mass
anomalous dimension $\gamma_m$ shows that it is always greater than its value
in the quenched case. We also evaluate the $\beta$-function. The criticality

larger $N_f$ is required to restore chiral symmetry for an increasing

crawling, to accurately estimate a given metric of interest. We design a random
walk on an appropriately defined weighted graph that achieves high efficiency
by preferentially crawling those nodes and edges that convey greater
information regarding the target metric. Our approach begins by employing the
theory of stratification to find optimal node weights, for a given estimation
problem, under an independence sampler. While optimal under independence
sampling, these weights may be impractical under graph crawling due to
constraints arising from the structure of the graph. Therefore, the edge
weights for our random walk should be chosen so as to lead to an equilibrium
distribution that strikes a balance between approximating the optimal weights
under an independence sampler and achieving fast convergence. We propose a
heuristic approach (stratified weighted random walk, or S-WRW) that achieves
this goal, while using only limited information about the graph structure and
the node properties. We evaluate our technique in simulation, and
experimentally, by collecting a sample of Facebook college users. We show that
S-WRW requires 13-15 times fewer samples than the simple re-weighted random
walk (RW) to achieve the same estimation accuracy for a range of metrics.

bands. The value of $E_g$ may be adjusted by varying the frequency and
intensity of the light and could be much larger compared to that which is
generated by spin-orbit coupling, and may reach values of the gap reported for
epitaxially grown graphene. We report plasmon dispersion relations for various
energy gaps and separation between graphene layers. For a single graphene
sheet, we find that plasmon modes may be excited for larger wave vector and
frequency when subjected to light. For double layers, we obtained an optical
and phonon-like mode and found that the optical mode is not as sensitive as the
phonon-like mode in the long wavelength limit when the layer separation is
varied, for a chosen $E_g$. Contrary to the notion that the effective mass
acquired by Dirac electrons provides a crossover to two-dimensional electron

properties as non-interacting fermions with quantized transport at the half

Specially we are interested in the weakly interacting trapped bosons in the
context of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as the energy spectrum shows a
transition from the collective to single particle nature with the increase in
the number of levels. However this has received less attention as it is
believed that the system may exhibit Poisson like fluctuations due to the
existence of external harmonic trap. Here we compute numerically the energy
levels of the zero-temperature many-boson systems which are weakly interacting
through the van der Waals potential and are in the 3D confined harmonic
potential. We study the nearest neighbour spacing distribution and the spectral
rigidity by unfolding the spectrum. It is found that increase in number of
energy levels for repulsive BEC induces a transition from a Wigner like form
displaying level repulsion to Poisson distribution for P(s). It does not follow
the GOE prediction. For repulsive interaction, the lower levels are correlated
and manifest level repulsion. For intermediate levels P (s) shows mixed
statistic which clearly signifies the existence of two energy scales: external
trap and interatomic interaction. Whereas for very high levels the trapping
potential dominates, genarating Poisson distribution. Comparison with
mean-field results for lower levels are also presented. For attractive BEC near
the critical point we observe the Shrielman like peak near s=0 which signifies
the presence of large number of quasi-degenerate states.

have been proposed as plausible astrophysical tools to probe the gravitational
effects of dark matter structures. We study this effect on pulsar timing
through Shapiro time delay (or Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect) and Doppler
effects statistically, showing that the latter dominates the signal. For this
task, we relate the power spectrum of pulsar frequency change to the matter
power spectrum on small scales, which we compute using the stable clustering
hypothesis. We compare this power spectrum with the reach of current and future
observations of pulsar timing designed for gravitational wave (GW) detection.

signals, the sensitivity of the upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is only a
factor of few weaker than our optimistic predictions.

the Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) to create transmissive, reflective, and

when the first stars began to fill the universe with new light. It has
generally been argued that these stars formed in isolation and were extremely
massive - perhaps 100 times as massive as the Sun. In a recent study, Clark and
collaborators showed that this picture requires revision. They demonstrated
that the accretion disks that build up around Population III stars are strongly
susceptible to fragmentation and that the first stars should therefore form in
clusters rather than in isolation. We here use a series of high-resolution
hydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving mesh code AREPO to follow
up on this proposal and to study the influence of environmental parameters on
the level of fragmentation. We model the collapse of five independent minihalos
from cosmological initial conditions, through the runaway condensation of their
central gas clouds, to the formation of the first protostar, and beyond for a
further 1000 years. During this latter accretion phase, we represent the
optically thick regions of protostars by sink particles. Gas accumulates
rapidly in the circumstellar disk around the first protostar, fragmenting
vigorously to produce a small group of protostars. After an initial burst,
gravitational instability recurs periodically, forming additional protostars
with masses ranging from ~ 0.1 to 10 M_sun. Although the shape, multiplicity,
and normalization of the protostellar mass function depend on the details of
the sink-particle algorithm, fragmentation into protostars with diverse masses
occurs in all cases, confirming earlier reports of Population III stars forming
in clusters. Depending on the efficiency of later accretion and merging,
Population III stars may enter the main sequence in clusters and with much more
diverse masses than are commonly assumed.

of order 30 km / s between dark matter and gas permeated the universe on scales
below a few Mpc directly after recombination. We here use a series of
high-resolution moving-mesh calculations to show that these supersonic motions
significantly influence the virialization of the gas in minihalos, and delay
the formation of the first stars. As the gas streams into minihalos with bulk
velocities around 1 km / s at z ~ 20, the additional momentum and energy input
reduces the gas fractions and central densities of the halos, increasing the
typical virial mass required for efficient cooling by a factor of three, and
delaying Population III star formation by dz ~ 4. Since the distribution of the
magnitude of the streaming velocities is narrowly peaked around a
non-negligible value, this effect is important in most regions of the universe.
As a consequence, the increased minimum halo mass implies a reduction of the
absolute number of minihalos that can be expected to cool and form Population
III stars by up to an order of magnitude. We further find that the streaming
velocities increase the turbulent velocity dispersion of the minihalo gas,
which could affect its ability to fragment and hence alter the mass function of

attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) children. Introduction: ADHD is one of
the most widely spread condition of school aged children affecting 5% of
children of this age.The core clinical signs of ADHD are inattention,
restlessness and impulsivity. According to various authors direct measures of
attention are of two types: 1. Recording the alpha rhythm on the EEG and
event-related potentials (ERP); 2. Tests of reaction time, continuous
performance tests, paired associated learning, and tests of memorization; The
second one is evidence-based. As for the first one it is known that ERPs
especially of those with later response reflect the process of mental
effortfullness to select the appropriate behavior and accomplish decision
making during the action of target stimulus. Thus selection of action as well
as decision making is the most important points affected in ADHD children.
Besides in recent years EEG biofeedback (Neurofeedback) have become the
evidence-based in the treatment of ADHD. Unfortunately the effectiveness of
this approach on ERPs parameters is still unknown. Thus we aimed to study the
changes of ERPs after neurofeedback therapy. Methods: We have examined 16
children with ADHD before- and after 3- sessions of neurofeedback therapy and
23 without treatment. Results: We have observed statistically significant
improvement of parameters of later response like P300 in treated children
compared with untreated ones whereas the treatment was non effective for
earlier components of ERPs. Conclusions: Neurofeedback can affect on the
process of selection of action and decision making by means of changing of P300
parameters in ADHDchildren.

total stellar mass in clusters of galaxies, and contributes in roughly equal
proportion as the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) to the total baryon content of
clusters. Because of the potential importance of understanding the origin of
the ICL in the context of the formation and evolution of structure in the
Universe, the field has recently undergone a revival both in the quality and
quantity of observational and theoretical investigations. Due to cosmological
dimming, the observational work has mostly concentrated on low redshift
clusters, but clearly observations at higher redshifts can provide interesting
clues about the evolution of the diffuse component. In this paper we present
the first results of a program to characterize the ICL of intermediate redshift
clusters. We find that at z ~ 0.3, the X-ray cluster RX J0054.0-2823 already
has a significant ICL and that the fraction of the total light in the ICL and
the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is comparable to that of similar clusters at
lower redshift. We also find that the kinematics of the ICL is consistent with
it being the remnant of tidally destroyed galaxies streaming in the central
regions of the cluster, which has three central giant elliptical galaxies
acting as an efficient ""grinding machine"". Our cluster has a bi-modal
radial-velocity distribution and thus two possible values for the velocity
dispersion. We find that the cluster fits well in the correlation between
BCG+ICL fraction and cluster mass for a range of velocity dispersions, leading
us to question the validity of a relevant correlation between these two
quantities.

physics approach. We formulate a hydration model where the hydrogen bonds
between water molecules pertaining to the first shell of the protein
conformation may be either mainly formed or broken. At thermal equilibrium,
hydrogen bonds are formed at low temperature and are broken at high
temperature. To explore the solvent effect, we follow the folding of a large
sampling of protein chains, using a master-equation evolution. The dynamics
shows a clear mechanism. Above the glass-transition temperature, a large ratio
of chains fold very rapidly into the native structure irrespective of the
temperature, following pathways of high transition rates through structures
surrounded by the solvent with broken hydrogen bonds. Although these states
have an infinitesimal probability, they act as strong dynamical attractors and
fast folding proceeds along these routes rather than pathways with small
transition rates between configurations of much higher equilibrium
probabilities. At a given low temperature, a broad jump in the folding times is
observed. Below this glass temperature, the pathways where hydrogen bonds are
mainly formed become those of highest rates although with conformational
changes of huge relaxation times. The present results reveal that folding obeys
a double-funnel mechanism.

recently as a promising framework in collaborative inter-domain network

e.g., Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based
on Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm (SSS). Such techniques are complete from a
computation-theoretic perspective: given a set of private inputs, it is
possible to perform arbitrary computation tasks without revealing any of the
intermediate results. In fact, HE and SSS can operate also on secret inputs
and/or provide secret outputs. However, they are computationally expensive and
do not scale well in the number of players and/or in the rate of computation
tasks. In this paper we advocate the use of ""elementary"" (as opposite to
""complete"") Secure Multiparty Computation (E-SMC) procedures for traffic
monitoring. E-SMC supports only simple computations with private input and
public output, i.e., it can not handle secret input nor secret (intermediate)
output. Such a simplification brings a dramatic reduction in complexity and
enables massive-scale implementation with acceptable delay and overhead.
Notwithstanding its simplicity, we claim that an E-SMC scheme is sufficient to
perform a great variety of computation tasks of practical relevance to
collaborative network monitoring, including, e.g., anonymous publishing and set
operations. This is achieved by combining a E-SMC scheme with data structures
like Bloom Filters and bitmap strings.

expansion of HII regions and surrounding photodissociation regions in

the effects of ionising and non-ionising ultraviolet radiation and x rays from
young star clusters. We find that HII region expansion reduces the disordered
component of the B field, imposing a large-scale order on the field around its
border. The field in the neutral gas lies along the ionisation front, while the
field in the ionised gas tends to be perpendicular to this. The highest
pressure compressed neutral/molecular gas is driven towards approximate
equipartition between thermal/magnetic/turbulent energy densities, whereas
lower pressure neutral/molecular gas divides into quiescent, magnetically
dominated regions, and, on the other hand, turbulent, demagnetised regions. The
ionised gas shows approximate thermal/turbulent equipartition, but with
magnetic energy densities 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower. A high velocity
dispersion (approx 8 km/s) is maintained in the ionised gas throughout our
simulations, despite the mean expansion velocity being significantly lower. The
B field does not significantly brake the HII region expansion on the length and
timescales accessible to our simulations, but it does tend to suppress the
small-scale fragmentation and radiation-driven implosion of neutral/molecular
gas that forms globules and pillars at the edge of the HII region. However, the
relative luminosity of ionising and non-ionising radiation has a much larger
influence than the presence or absence of the B field. When the radiation field
is relatively soft (as in the case of a lower mass cluster, with earliest
spectral type of B0.5), then fragmentation is less vigorous and a thick,
relatively smooth PDR forms. Movies available at

in the 330-373 GHz regime from the JCMT Spectral Legacy Survey. Out of ~160
spectral features, this paper uses the 35 that are spatially resolved.
  The observed spatial distributions of a selection of six species are compared
with radiative transfer models based on a static spherically symmetric
structure, a dynamic spherical structure, and a static flattened structure. The
maps of CO and its isotopic variations exhibit elongated geometries on scales
of ~100"", and smaller scale substructure is found in maps of N2H+, o-H2CO, CS,
SO2, CCH, and methanol lines. A velocity gradient is apparent in maps of all
molecular lines presented here, except SO, SO2, and H2CO. We find two emission
peaks in warm (Eup~200K) methanol separated by 12"", indicative of a secondary
heating source in the envelope.
  The spherical models are able to explain the distribution of emission for the
optically thin H13CO+ and C34S, but not for the optically thick HCN, HCO+, and
CS, nor for the optically thin C17O. The introduction of velocity structure
mitigates the optical depth effects, but does not fully explain the
observations, especially in the spectral dimension. A static flattened envelope
viewed at a small inclination angle does slightly better.
  We conclude that a geometry of the envelope other than an isotropic static
sphere is needed to circumvent line optical depth effects. We propose that this
could be achieved in envelope models with an outflow cavity and/or
inhomogeneous structure at scales smaller than ~10^4 AU. The picture of
inhomogeneity is supported by observed substructure in at least six species.

the effective potential the renormalization group evolution of the Higgs
quartic coupling lambda above the LW scale. After clarifying an apparent
discrepancy with previous results for the LW Abelian Higgs model we focus on
the LWSM. In contrast with the SM case, for any Mh, lambda grows monotonically
and hits a Landau pole at a fixed trans-Planckian scale (never turning negative
in the UV). Then, the perturbativity and stability bounds on Mh disappear. We
identify a cutoff ~10^{16} GeV for the LWSM due to the hypercharge gauge

practical solvability by semigroup theory. The difference between semigroup and

r_B hinders supersonic accretion. We take into account saturated electron
thermal conductivity and Bremsstrahlung energy losses of two temperature plasma
for density and temperature near the Bondi radius similar to those observed in
M87 galaxy. Joint action of electron thermal conductivity and free-free
radiation leads to the effective cooling of accreting plasma and formation of
the subsonic settling of accreting gas above the zone of a centrifugal barrier.
A toroidal condensation and a hollow funnel that separates the torus from the
black hole emerge near the barrier. The barrier divides the flow into two
regions: (1) the settling zone with slow subKeplerian rotation and (2) the zone
with rapid supersonic nearly Keplerian rotation. Existence of the centrifugal
barrier leads to significant decrease of the accretion rate dM/dt in comparison
with the critical Bondi solution for gamma=5/3. Shear instabilities in the
torus and related friction cause the gas to spread slowly in the equatorial
plane in two directions. As a result, outer (r>r_c) and inner (r<r_c) disks are
formed. The gas enters the zone of the internal ADAF flow along the accretion
disk (r<r_c). Since the angular momentum is conserved, the outer disk removes
outward an excess of angular momentum along with part of the matter falling
into the torus. Such outer Keplerian disk was observed by Hubble Space
Telescope around the nucleus of the M87 galaxy in the optical emission lines.
Turbulence causes rotation. We discuss the characteristic times during which
the turbulence should lead to the changes in the orientation of the torus,
accretion disk and, possibly, of the jet.

production in massive stars. The dominant production sites in such events were
recently investigated by using stellar model calculations: explosive
neon-carbon burning, convective shell carbon burning, and convective core
hydrogen burning. Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations are performed
for each of these sites by adopting temperature-density-time profiles from
recent stellar evolution models. For each profile, we individually multiplied
the rates of all relevant reactions by factors of 10, 2, 0.5 and 0.1, and
analyzed the resulting abundance changes of 26Al. Our simulations are based on
a next-generation nuclear physics library, called STARLIB, which contains a
recent evaluation of Monte Carlo reaction rates. Particular attention is paid
to quantifying the rate uncertainties of those reactions that most sensitively
influence 26Al production. For stellar modelers our results indicate to what
degree predictions of 26Al nucleosynthesis depend on currently uncertain
nuclear physics input, while for nuclear experimentalists our results represent
a guide for future measurements. We tabulate the results of our reaction rate
sensitivity study for each of the three distinct massive star sites referred to
above. It is found that several current reaction rate uncertainties influence
the production of 26Al. Particularly important reactions are 26Al(n,p)26Mg,
25Mg(alpha,n)28Si, 24Mg(n,gamma)25Mg and 23Na(alpha,p)26Mg. These reactions
should be prime targets for future measurements. Overall, we estimate that the
nuclear physics uncertainty of the 26Al yield predicted by the massive star
models explored here amounts to about a factor of 3.

theory amplitudes. Such relations give additional structural simplifications
for amplitudes in QCD. Remarkably, their origin lie in an analogous set of
relations that involve also gravitons. When certain gluon helicities are
flipped we obtain relations that do not involve gravitons, but which refer only
to QCD.

media with some disorder, neglecting material dispersion. When choosing a gauge
in which the static potential vanishes, the normal modes of the medium with
disorder satisfy another transversality condition than the modes of the ideal
medium. Our first result is an integral equation for optical modes such that
all perturbation-theory solutions automatically satisfy the desired
transversality condition. Secondly, when expanding the vector potential for the
medium with disorder in terms of the normal modes of the ideal structure, we
find the gauge transformation that makes the static potential zero, thereby
generalizing work by Glauber and Lewenstein [Phys. Rev. A 43, 467 (1991)]. Our
results are relevant for the quantum optics of disordered photonic crystals.

detecting both final protons at the PROMICE-WASA facility and identifying the
photon through the resulting missing-mass peak. The photon angular distribution
in the center-of-mass system and those of the proton-proton relative momentum
with respect to the beam direction and to that of the recoil photon were
determined reliably up to a final pp excitation energy of Epp ~ 30 MeV. Except
for very small Epp values, the behavior of these distributions with excitation
energy is well reproduced by a new refined model of the hard bremsstrahlung
process. The model reproduces absolutely the total cross section and its energy
dependence to within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.

local operations and classical communication) classifications increases with
the number of qubits and is already infinite for four qubits. Bearing in mind
the rapid evolution of experimental technology, criteria for explicitly
discriminating and classifying pure states of four and more qubits are highly
desirable and therefore in the focus of intense theoretical research. In this
article we develop a general criterion for the discrimination of pure N-partite
entangled states in terms of polynomial SL(d,C) invariants. By means of this
criterion, existing SLOCC classifications of four-qubit entanglement are
reproduced. Based on this we propose a polynomial classification scheme in
which families are identified through 'tangle patterns', thus bringing together
qualitative and quantitative description of entanglement.

finite graph G from the determinant of 2^{2g} matrices, where g is the genus of
a surface in which G embeds. We show that in the case of isoradially embedded
graphs with critical weights, these determinants have quite remarkable
properties. First of all, they satisfy some generalized Kramers-Wannier
duality: there is an explicit equality relating the determinants associated to
a graph and to its dual graph. Also, they are proportional to the determinants
of the discrete critical Laplacians on the graph G, exactly when the genus g is
zero or one. Finally, they share several formal properties with the Ray-Singer
\bar\partial-torsions of the Riemann surface in which G embeds.

ultracold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Lattice can be designed
on thin layer of magnetic films such as $Tb_6$$Gd_10$$Fe_{80}$$Co_4$. In
details, we investigate single layer and two crossed layers of sawtooth
magnetic patterns with thicknesses of 50 and 500nm respectively with a
periodicity of 1$\mu$m. Trap depth and frequencies can be changed via an
applied bias field to handle tunneling rates between lattice sites. We present
analytical expressions and using numerical calculations show that this lattice
has non-zero potential minima to avoid majorana spin flips. One advantage of
this lattice over previous ones is that it is easier to manufacture.

in the period 1992 onwards. It is a historically based exposition and an
extension of the hyperbolic version of special relativity first proposed by
Vari\'cak (1910 etc) and others not long after the appearance of the early
papers of Einstein and Minkowski. The book's approach puts emphasis on the
concept of hyperbolic velocity (scaled rapidity) and in this respect differs
markedly from the gyro theory of Ungar. New formulations are given in optics
relating hyperbolic velocity with logarithmic redshift and in dynamics
including a reformulation of Newton's 2nd law in terms of hyperbolic
acceleration so avoiding velocity-dependent mass. The concept of differential
Minkowski space is introduced and related to the hyperbolic theory and to
Carath\'eodory's axiomatic approach to the special theory.
