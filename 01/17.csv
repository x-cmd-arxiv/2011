treatment planning. It determines to what degree one can achieve a good
treatment plan quality in the subsequent plan optimization process. In this
paper, we have developed a BOO algorithm via adaptive l_1 minimization.
Specifically, we introduce a sparsity energy function term into our model which
contains weighting factors for each beam angle adaptively adjusted during the
optimization process. Such an energy term favors small number of beam angles.
By optimizing a total energy function containing a dosimetric term and the
sparsity term, we are able to identify the unimportant beam angles and
gradually remove them without largely sacrificing the dosimetric objective. In
one typical prostate case, the convergence property of our algorithm, as well
as the how the beam angles are selected during the optimization process, is
demonstrated. Fluence map optimization (FMO) is then performed based on the
optimized beam angles. The resulted plan quality is presented and found to be
better than that obtained from unoptimized (equiangular) beam orientations. We
have further systematically validated our algorithm in the contexts of 5-9
coplanar beams for 5 prostate cases and 1 head and neck case. For each case,
the final FMO objective function value is used to compare the optimized beam
orientations and the equiangular ones. It is found that, our BOO algorithm can
lead to beam configurations which attain lower FMO objective function values
than corresponding equiangular cases, indicating the effectiveness of our BOO
algorithm.

Msun mass range. Our obtained disk masses scale near-linearly with the stellar
mass. The mean and median disk masses in the Class 0 and I phases

from observations by (at least) a factor of 2--3. We demonstrate that this
disagreement may (in part) be caused by the optically thick inner regions of
protostellar disks, which do not contribute to millimeter dust flux. We find
that disk masses and surface densities start to systematically exceed that of
the minimum mass solar nebular for objects with stellar mass as low as
M_st=0.05-0.1 Msun. Concurrently, disk radii start to grow beyond 100 AU,
making gravitational fragmentation in the disk outer regions possible. Large
disk masses, surface densities, and sizes suggest that giant planets may start
forming as early as in the EPSF, either by means of core accretion (inner disk
regions) or direct gravitational instability (outer disk regions), thus
breaking a longstanding stereotype that the planet formation process begins in
the Class II phase.

(CDM), originally proposed to solve problems that arose when the collisionless
CDM theory of structure formation was compared with observations of galaxies on
small scales. The quantitative impact of the proposed elastic collisions on
structure formation has been estimated previously by Monte Carlo N-body
simulations and by a conducting fluid model, with apparently diverging results.
To improve this situation, we make direct comparisons between new Monte Carlo
N-body simulations and solutions of the conducting fluid model, for isolated
SIDM haloes of fixed mass. This allows us to separate cleanly the effects of
gravothermal relaxation from those of continuous mass accretion in an expanding
background universe. When these two methods were previously applied to halo
formation with cosmological boundary conditions, they disagreed by an order of
magnitude about the size of the scattering cross section required to solve the
so-called 'cusp-core problem.' We show here, however, that the methods agree
with each other within 20 per cent for isolated haloes. This suggests that the
two methods are consistent, and that their disagreement for cosmological haloes
is not caused by a breakdown of their validity.
  The isolated haloes studied here undergo gravothermal collapse. We compare
the solutions calculated by these two methods for gravothermal collapse
starting from several initial conditions. This allows us to calibrate the heat
conduction which accounts for the effect of elastic hard-sphere scattering in
the fluid model. The amount of tuning of the thermal conductivity parameters
required to bring the two methods into close agreement for isolated haloes,
however, is too small to explain the discrepancy found previously in the
cosmological context.

cone and of the state space. We write a convex duality for general self-dual
convex cones. This restricts to projections of state spaces and connects them
to results on spectrahedra.
  Really new in this article is an analysis of the face lattice of convex
support by mapping this lattice to a lattice of orthogonal projections, using
natural isomorphisms. The result encodes the face lattice of the convex support
into a set of projections in A and enables the integration of convex geometry
with matrix calculus or algebraic techniques.

monotone graph property $\mP$ we say that a base graph $G=([n],E)$ is
\emph{$\bk$-resilient} with respect to $\mP$ if for every subgraph $H\subseteq
G$ such that $d_H(i)\leq k_i$ for every $1\leq i\leq n$ the graph $G-H$
possesses $\mP$. This notion naturally extends the idea of the \emph{local
resilience} of graphs recently initiated by Sudakov and Vu. In this paper we
study the $\bk$-resilience of a typical graph from $\GNP$ with respect to the
Hamiltonicity property where we let $p$ range over all values for which the
base graph is expected to be Hamiltonian. In particular, we prove that for
every $\epsilon>0$ and $p\geq\frac{\ln n+\ln\ln n +\omega(1)}{n}$ if a graph is
sampled from $\GNP$ then with high probability removing from each vertex of
""small"" degree all incident edges but two and from any other vertex at most a
$(\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon)$-fraction of the incident edges will result in a
Hamiltonian graph.
  Considering this generalized approach to the notion of resilience allows to
establish several corollaries which improve on the best known bounds of
Hamiltonicity related questions. It implies that for every positive
$\epsilon>0$ and large enough values of $K$, if $p>\frac{K\ln n}{n}$ then with
high probability the local resilience of $\GNP$ with respect to being
Hamiltonian is at least $(1-\epsilon)np/3$, improving on the previous bound for
this range of $p$. Another implication is a result on optimal packing of edge
disjoint Hamilton cycles in a random graph. We prove that if
$p\leq\frac{1.02\ln n}{n}$ then with high probability a graph $G$ sampled from
$\GNP$ contains $\lfloor\frac{\delta(G)}{2}\rfloor$ edge disjoint Hamilton
cycles, extending the previous range of $p$ for which this was known to hold.

detection of neutrinos and antineutrinos from the Sun, supernovae, nuclear
reactors, and the Earth. The feeble nature of these signals requires a strong
suppression of backgrounds below a few MeV. Very low intrinsic radiogenic
contamination of all detector components needs to be accompanied by the
efficient identification of muons and of muon-induced backgrounds. Muons
produce unstable nuclei by spallation processes along their trajectory through
the detector whose decays can mimic the expected signals; for isotopes with
half-lives longer than a few seconds, the dead time induced by a muon-related
veto becomes unacceptably long, unless its application can be restricted to a
sub-volume along the muon track. Consequently, not only the identification of
muons with very high efficiency but also a precise reconstruction of their
tracks is of primary importance for the physics program of the experiment. The
Borexino inner detector is surrounded by an outer water-Cherenkov detector that
plays a fundamental role in accomplishing this task. The detector design
principles and their implementation are described. The strategies adopted to
identify muons are reviewed and their efficiency is evaluated. The overall muon
veto efficiency is found to be 99.992% or better. Ad-hoc track reconstruction
algorithms developed are presented. Their performance is tested against muon
events of known direction such as those from the CNGS neutrino beam, test
tracks available from a dedicated External Muon Tracker and cosmic muons whose
angular distribution reflects the local overburden profile. The achieved
angular resolution is 3-5 deg and the lateral resolution is 35-50 cm, depending
on the impact parameter of the crossing muon. The methods implemented to
efficiently tag cosmogenic neutrons are also presented.

with pressure, as determined from the weight of the gas layer in the galaxy. In

connections between these arms and star formation. Flocculent spiral arms are
most likely the result of transient instabilities in the gas that promote dense
cloud formation, star formation, and generate turbulence. Long irregular spiral
arms are usually initiated by gravitational instabilities in the stars, with
the gas contributing to and following these instabilities, and star formation
in the gas. Global spiral arms triggered by global perturbations, such as a
galaxy interaction, can be wavemodes with wave reflection in the inner regions.
They might grow and dominate the disk for several rotations before degenerating
into higher-order modes by non-linear effects. Interstellar gas flows through
these global arms, and through the more transient stellar spiral arms as well,
where it can reach a high density and low shear, thereby promoting
self-gravitational instabilities. The result is the formation of giant spiral
arm cloud complexes, in which dense molecular clouds form and turn into stars.
The molecular envelops and debris from these clouds appear to survive and drift
through the interarm regions for a long time, possibly 100 Myr or more, with
lingering spontaneous star formation and triggered star formation in the pieces
that are still at high-pressure edges near older HII regions.

Malkhi in 2006 motivated by applications in social networking. Initially there
are n agents wishing to coalesce into one cluster via a decentralized
stochastic process, where each round is as follows: every cluster flips a fair
coin to dictate whether it is to issue or accept requests in this round.
Issuing a request amounts to contacting a cluster randomly chosen
proportionally to its size. A cluster accepting requests is to select an
incoming one uniformly (if there are such) and merge with that cluster.
Empirical results by Fernandess and Malkhi suggested the protocol concludes in
O(log n) rounds with high probability, whereas numerical estimates by Oded
Schramm, based on an ingenious analytic approximation, suggested that the
coalescence time should be super-logarithmic. Our contribution is a rigorous
study of the stochastic coalescence process with two consequences. First, we
confirm that the above process indeed requires super-logarithmic time w.h.p.,
where the inefficient rounds are due to oversized clusters that occasionally
develop. Second, we remedy this by showing that a simple modification produces
an essentially optimal distributed protocol; if clusters favor their smallest
incoming merge request then the process does terminate in O(log n) rounds
w.h.p., and simulations show that the new protocol readily outperforms the
original one. Our upper bound hinges on a potential function involving the
logarithm of the number of clusters and the cluster-susceptibility, carefully
chosen to form a supermartingale. The analysis of the lower bound builds upon
the novel approach of Schramm which may find additional applications: rather
than seeking a single parameter that controls the system behavior, instead one
approximates the system by the Laplace transform of the entire cluster-size
distribution.

Galaxies form large regions on the scale of the interstellar Jeans length and

follow this pattern, producing star complexes on the largest scales, OB
associations on smaller scales, and so on down to star clusters and individual
stars. Inside each scale and during the lifetime of the cloud on that scale,
smaller regions come and go in a hierarchy of time. As a result, cluster
positions are correlated with power law functions, and so are their ages. At
the lowest level in the hierarchy, clusters are observed to form in pairs. For
any hierarchy like this, the efficiency is automatically highest in the densest
regions. This high efficiency promotes bound cluster formation. Also for any
hierarchy, the mass function of the components is a power law with a slope of
around -2, as observed for clusters.

Consider our perennial model, the harmonic oscillator, for which we need
Hermite functions, or the Laguerre functions in quantum mechanics. Here we
choose a particular number theoretical function, the Riemann zeta function and
examine its influence in the realm of physics and also how physics may be
suggestive for the resolution of one of mathematics' most famous unconfirmed
conjectures, the Riemann Hypothesis. Does physics hold an essential key to the
solution for this more than hundred-year-old problem? In this work we examine
numerous models from different branches of physics, from classical mechanics to
statistical physics, where this function plays an integral role. We also see
how this function is related to quantum chaos and how its pole-structure
encodes when particles can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation at low
temperature. Throughout these examinations we highlight how physics can perhaps
shed light on the Riemann Hypothesis. Naturally, our aim could not be to be
comprehensive, rather we focus on the major models and aim to give an informed
starting point for the interested Reader.

that use of graphite powder with a large grain size enables preparation of a

obtain graphene without mechanical exfoliation. However, the reduction methods
employed so far have been insufficient to remove oxygen or to restore the long

oxygen from the GO sheet. These results would open a new way to synthesize a
high quality graphene film, which replaces the conventional CVD method.

reduced by a transverse electric field and completely closed at a critical
field which decreases with increasing ribbon width. In addition, a distinct gap
modulation in the ribbons with zigzag edges is presented when a reversed
electric field is applied. In a weak field, the gap reduction of the BNNRs with
zigzag edges originates from the field-induced energy level shifts of the
spatially separated edge-states, while the gap reduction of the BNNRs with
armchair edges arises from the Stark effect. As the field gets stronger, the
energy gaps of both types of the BNNRs gradually close due to the field-induced
motion of nearly free electron states. Without the applied fields, the energy
gap modulation by varying ribbon width is rather limited.

therefore, appears to work as well for these late-type dwarf galaxies as it
does for spiral galaxies. Some of the mass-to-light ratios required in our
maximum disk fits are high, however, up to about 15 in the R-band, with the

Equally well-fitting mass models can be obtained with much lower mass-to-light

that the maximum disk can explain the inner parts of the observed rotation

set two types of voters--herders and independents. The voting of independent
voters is based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, the voting of
herders is based on the number of votes. Herders always select the majority of
the previous $r$ votes, which is visible to them. We call them digital herders.
We can accurately calculate the distribution of votes for special cases. When
r>=3, we find that a phase transition occurs at the upper limit of t, where t
is the discrete time (or number of votes). As the fraction of herders
increases, the model features a phase transition beyond which a state where
most voters make the correct choice coexists with one where most of them are
wrong. On the other hand, when r<3, there is no phase transition. In this case,
the herders' performance is the same as that of the independent voters.
Finally, we recognize the behavior of human beings by conducting simple
experiments.

chemical composition of their direct descendants, extremely metal-poor stars

Such stars are exceedingly rare, the most successful surveys, for this purpose,
have so far provided only about 100 stars with 1/1000 the solar metallicity and
4 stars with about 1/10000 of the solar metallicity. The Sloan Digital Sky
Survey has the potential to provide a large number of candidates of extremely
low metallicity. X-Shooter has the unique capability of performing the
necessary follow-up spectroscopy providing accurate metallicities and abundance
ratios for several elements (Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Sr,...) for EMP candidates. We
here report on the results for the first two stars observed in the course of
our franco-italian X-Shooter GTO. The two stars were targeted to be of
metallicity around -3.0, the analysis of the X-Shooter spectra showed them to
be of metallicity around -2.0, but with a low alpha to iron ratio, which
explains the underestimate of the metallicity from the SDSS spectra. The
efficiency of X-Shooter allows an in situ study of the outer Halo, for the two
stars studied here we estimate distances of 3.9 and 9.1 Kpc, these are likely
the most distant dwarf stars studied in detail to date.

technique, from the description of the multiplicity structure in terms of
differentials. The deflated system can be used in Newton-based iterative
schemes with quadratic convergence. Starting from a polynomial system and a
small-enough neighborhood, we obtain a criterion for the existence and
uniqueness of a singular root of a given multiplicity structure, applying a
well-chosen symbolic perturbation. Standard verification methods, based eg. on
interval arithmetic and a fixed point theorem, are employed to certify that
there exists a unique perturbed system with a singular root in the domain.
Applications to topological degree computation and to the analysis of real
branches of an implicit curve illustrate the method.

performance of community networks, especially on the competition between
individual community and the whole network, are studied in detail. The study is
organized from two aspects: the number or portion of external links and the
connecting strategy of external links between different communities. It is
found that increasing the number of external links will enhance the global
synchronizability but degrade the ynchronization performance of individual
community before some critical point. After that the individual community will
synchronize better and better as part of the whole network because the
community structure is not so prominent. Among various connection strategies,
connecting nodes belonging to different communities randomly rather than
connecting nodes with larger degrees is the most efficient way to enhance
global synchronization of the network. However, a preferential connection
scheme linking most of the hubs from the communities will allow rather
efficient global synchronization while maintaining strong dynamical clustering
of the communities. Interestingly, the observations are found to be relevant in
a realistic network of cat cortex. The synchronization state is just at the
critical point, which shows a reasonable combination of segregated function in
individual communities and coordination among them. Our work sheds light on
principles underlying the emergence of modular architectures in real network
systems and provides guidance for the manipulation of synchronization in
community networks.

bound of magnitude $2\pi R/\hbar c$ to the entropy-to-energy ratio $S/E$ of an
arbitrary {\it three} dimensional system of proper radius $R$ and negligible
self-gravity. In this paper we derive a generalized upper bound on the
entropy-to-energy ratio of a $(D+1)$-dimensional system. We consider a box full
of entropy lowered towards and then dropped into a $(D+1)$-dimensional black
hole in equilibrium with thermal radiation. In the canonical case of three
spatial dimensions, it was previously established that due to quantum buoyancy
effects the box floats at some neutral point very close to the horizon. We find
here that the significance of quantum buoyancy increases dramatically with the
number $D$ of spatial dimensions. In particular, we find that the neutral
(floating) point of the box lies near the horizon only if its length $b$ is
large enough such that $b/b_C>F(D)$, where $b_C$ is the Compton length of the
body and $F(D)\sim D^{D/2}\gg1$ for $D\gg1$. A consequence is that quantum
buoyancy severely restricts our ability to deduce the universal entropy bound
from the generalized second law of thermodynamics in higher-dimensional
spacetimes with $D\gg1$. Nevertheless, we find that the universal entropy bound
is always a sufficient condition for operation of the generalized second law in
this type of gedanken experiments.

locally in radiative equilibrium and the transport of energy by the geophysical
fluids (atmosphere and ocean) plays a fundamental role in determining its
climate. Using simple energy-balance models, it was suggested a few decades ago
that the meridional energy fluxes might follow a thermodynamic Maximum Entropy
Production (MEP) principle. In the present study, we assess the MEP hypothesis
in the framework of a minimal climate model based solely on a robust radiative
scheme and the MEP principle, with no extra assumptions. Specifically, we show
that by choosing an adequate radiative exchange formulation, the Net Exchange
Formulation, a rigorous derivation of all the physical parameters can be
performed. The MEP principle is also extended to surface energy fluxes, in
addition to meridional energy fluxes. The climate model presented here is
extremely fast, needs very little empirical data and does not rely on ad hoc
parameterizations. We investigate its range of validity by comparing its
performances for pre-industrial climate and Last Glacial Maximum climate with
corresponding simulations with the IPSL coupled atmosphere-ocean General
Circulation Model IPSL_CM4, finding reasonable agreement. Beyond the practical
interest of this result for climate modelling, it supports the idea that, to a
certain extent, climate can be characterized with macroscale features with no
need to compute the underlying microscale dynamics.

spectroscopy to determine the density matrix of strong-field-generated Kr+

multichannel strong-field-ionization theory. But there is significant
disagreement between experiment and theory with respect to the degree of

attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of strong-field-generated ions is
developed. The theory is formulated in such a way that the nonperturbative

account. The impact of attosecond pulse propagation effects on the
interpretation of experimental data is investigated both analytically and

unique opportunities to study hyperons as well as antihyperons in nuclear
systems. Precise $\gamma$-spectroscopy of multi-strange hypernuclei will serve
as a laboratory for the hyperon-hyperon interaction. Exclusive
hadron-antihadron pair production close to threshold can measure the potential
of a antihadron relative to that of the coincident hadrons.
  In the present work we explore the production of excited states in double
hypernuclei following the micro-canonical break-up of an initially excited
double hypernucleus which is created by the absorption and conversion of a
stopped $\Xi^{-}$ hyperon. Generally the formation of excited hypernuclear
states relative to ground states dominates in this model. For different initial
target nuclei which absorb the $\Xi^-$, different double hypernuclei nuclei
dominate. We also compare the model predictions with the correlated pion
spectra measured by the E906 collaboration.
  In antiproton nucleus reactions the event-by-event transverse momentum
correlations of hadron-antihadron pairs produced close to threshold contain
information on the difference between the nuclear potential of the hadron and
the associated antihadron. For produced D-meson pairs at 6.7\gevc1 the
sensitivity of the transverse momenta correlation will probably be to small to
deduce differences between the potentials for D$^+$ and D$^-$ mesons. However,
for {\PgX\PagX} pairs produced at 2.9\gevc1 the asymmetry is sufficiently
sensitive to predicted differences between the {\PgX} and {\PagX} potentials
even if the momentum and density dependence of the the potential are taken into
account.

the qubits to a Duffing oscillator as the chaotic setup. Significantly, the

essential aspect to evaluate the feasibility of the technique and to know the

acoustic transmitters that, on one hand, are able to mimic the signature of a
UHE neutrino interaction, that is, a bipolar acoustic pulse with the 'pancake'
directivity, and, on the other hand, fulfill practical issues such as ease of
deployment and operation. This is a non-trivial problem since it requires
directive transducer with cylindrical symmetry for a broadband frequency range.
Classical solutions using linear arrays of acoustic transducers result in long
arrays with many elements, which increase the cost and the complexity for
deployment and operation. In this paper we present the extension of our
previous R&D studies using the parametric acoustic source technique by dealing
with the cylindrical symmetry, and demonstrating that it is possible to use
this technique for having a compact solution that could be much more easily
included in neutrino telescope infrastructures or used in specific sea
campaigns for calibration.

is investigated. The network consists of three nodes, all having access to a
common channel with half-duplex constraint. Two nodes want to establish a
dialog while the third node can assist in the bi-directional transmission
process. All nodes have agreed on a transmission protocol a priori and the
problem is restricted to the dialog encoders not being allowed to establish a
cooperation by the use of previous receive signals. The channel is referred to
as the restricted half-duplex two-way relay channel. Here the channel is
defined and an outer bound on the achievable rates is derived by the
application of the cut-set theorem. This shows that the problem consists of six
parts. We propose a transmission protocol which takes into account all possible
transmit-receive configurations of the network and performs partial decoding of
the messages at the relay as well as sequential decoding at the dialog nodes.
By the use of random codes and suboptimal decoders, two inner bound on the
achievable rates are derived. Restricting to the suggested strategies and fixed
input distributions it is argued to be possible to determine optimal
transmission schemes with respect to various reasonable objectives at low
complexity. In comparison to two-way communication without relay, simulations
for an AWGN channel model then show that it is possible to simultaneously
increase the communication rates of both dialog messages and to outperform
relaying strategies that ignore an available direct path.

propagated radially. We also analyze the influence of the background magnetic

magnetic field energy density and that the CME tended to propagate to the

arbitrary bed profile in the presence of external force is proposed. This
method uses the quasi-two-layer model of hydrodynamic flows over a stepwise
boundary with advanced consideration of the flow features near the step. A
distinctive feature of the suggested model is a separation of a studied flow
into two layers in calculating flow quantities near each step, and improving by
this means approximation of depth-averaged solutions of the initial
three-dimensional Euler equations. We are solving the shallow-water equations
for one layer, introducing the fictitious lower layer only as an auxiliary
structure in setting up the appropriate Riemann problems for the upper layer.
Besides quasi-two-layer approach leads to appearance of additional terms in
one-layer finite-difference representation of balance equations. These terms
provide the mechanical work made by nonhomogeneous bed interacting with flow. A
notable advantage of the proposed method is the consideration of the properties
of the process of the waterfall, namely the fluid flow on the step in which the
fluid does not wet part of the vertical wall of the step. The presence of dry
zones in the vertical part of the step indicates violation of the conditions of
hydrostatic flow. The quasi-two-layer approach determines the size of the dry
zone of the vertical component of the step. Consequently it gives an
opportunity to figure out the amount of flow kinetic energy dissipation on
complex boundary. Numerical simulations are performed based on the proposed
algorithm of various physical phenomena, such as a breakdown of the rectangular
fluid column over an inclined plane, large-scale motion of fluid in the gravity
field in the presence of Coriolis force over an mounted obstacle on underlying

$\rho>2/3$) at any value of $V/t$. At commensurate densities $\rho=1/3$, $1/2$,

large interaction $V$. For intermediate densities $1/3<\rho<2/3$ and large

implying gapped single-particle excitations but gapless excitations of boson
pairs. Here, the low-energy properties may be described by a two-component
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with a finite gap in the antisymmetric sector.

South-East [E_g(B-V) = 0.57 mag]. Similarly, the surface density of star
formation rate peaks in the NW region of NGC 1569, reaching a value of about 4
x 10^-6 M_sun yr^-1 pc^-2. The total star formation rate as estimated from the
integrated, dereddened Halpha luminosity is about 0.4 M_sun yr^-1, and the
total supernova rate from the integrated, dereddened [FeII] luminosity is about
0.005 yr^-1 (assuming a distance of 3.36 Mpc). The azimuthally averaged
[FeII]/Brgamma flux ratio is larger at the edges of the central, gas-deficient
cavities (encompassing the super star clusters A and B) and in the galaxy
outskirts. If we interpret this line ratio as the ratio between the average
past star formation (as traced by supernovae) and on-going activity
(represented by OB stars able to ionize the interstellar medium), it would then
indicate that star formation has been quenched within the central cavities and
lately triggered in a ring around them. The number of ionizing hydrogen and
helium photons as computed from the integrated, dereddened Halpha and HeI
luminosities suggests that the latest burst of star formation occurred about 4
Myr ago and produced new stars with a total mass of ~1.8 x 10^6 M_sun.

properties. We find that the luminosity in the Halpha line - which we argue
gives a better measure of the total emission-line flux than the widely used
O[III] luminosity - is strongly correlated with the radio luminosity P1.4GHz.
We show that the absence of emission lines in about one third of our sample is
likely due to a detection threshold and not to a lack of optical activity. We
find that the properties of FRII galaxies are mainly driven by the Eddington
parameter LHa/""MBH"" or, equivalently, P1.4GHz/""MBH"". Radio galaxies with hot
spots are found among the ones with the highest values of P1.4GHz/""MBH"".
Compared to classical AGN hosts in the main galaxy sample of the SDSS, our FRII
galaxies show a larger proportion of objects with very hard ionizing radiation
field and large ionization parameter. A few objects are, on the contrary,
ionized by a softer radiation field. We find that the black hole masses and
stellar masses in FRII galaxies are very closely related. A comparison sample
of line-less galaxies in the SDSS follows the same relation, although on
average the masses are smaller. This suggests that the FRII radio phenomenon
occurs in normal elliptical galaxies, preferentially in the most massive ones.
Although most FRII galaxies are old, some contain traces of young stellar
populations. Such young populations are not seen in normal line-less galaxies,
suggesting that the activity in some FRII galaxies may be triggered by recent
star formation. The ""MBH""-Mgal relation in a comparison sample of radio-quiet
AGNs from the SDSS is very different, suggesting that galaxies which are still

sheets are likely to be ordered in the alternate anti-ferromagnetic fashion as
the material as whole behaves similarly to collinear anti-ferromagnet. Further
lowering of temperature simply expands sheet thickness leading to the near
triangular SDW. Finally, sheets fill the whole available space and almost
rectangular shape of SDW is reached. Substantial maximum amplitude of SDW
appears at the temperature just below the magnetic onset temperature, and this
maximum amplitude increases slightly with lowering temperature. The square root
from the mean squared hyperfine field behaves versus temperature according to
the universality class (1, 2), i.e., with the electronic spin space having
dimensionality equal unity and the real space having dimensionality equal two.
The more or less pronounced tail above transition temperature due to the
development of incoherent SDW is seen.

dynamics of the entanglement generated from a coherently pumped correlated
emission laser is presented. It is found that the time evolution of the
entanglement is significantly reliant on the phase fluctuation and dephasing,
particularly, at early stages of the lasing process. In the absence of external
driving radiation, the degree of entanglement and intensity turns out to attain
a maximum value just before starting to exhibit oscillation which dies at
longer time scale. However, in case the driving mechanism is on, the
oscillatory nature disappears due to the additional induced coherent
superposition and the degree of entanglement would be larger at steady state.
Moreover, the degree of entanglement as predicted by the logarithmic negativity
and the Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criteria exhibits a similar nature when there
is no driving radiation, although such a trend is eroded with increasing
strength of the pumping radiation at longer time scale. The other important
aspect of the phase fluctuation and dephasing is the possibility of relaxing
the time at which the maximum entanglement is detected.

destroyed by the noise.

  sample covariance random matrices","18 pages",,,,"math-ph math.MP math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider two classical ensembles of the random matrix theory: the Wigner
matrices and sample covariance matrices, and prove Central Limit Theorem for
linear eigenvalue statistics under rather weak (comparing with results known
before) conditions on the number of derivatives of the test functions and also
on the number of the entries moments. Moreover, we develop a universal method
which allows one to obtain automatically the bounds for the variance of
differentiable test functions, if there is a bound for the variance of the
trace of the resolvent of random matrix. The method is applicable not only to
the Wigner and sample covariance matrices, but to any ensemble of random
matrices.

  W{\l}odarczyk and A. Wojtaszek-Szwarc (The NA49 collaboration)","Energy dependence of kaon-to-proton ratio fluctuations in central Pb+Pb
  collisions from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 6.3 to 17.3 GeV","5 pages, 4 figures","Phys.Rev.C83:061902,2011","10.1103/PhysRevC.83.061902",,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kaons and protons carry large parts of two conserved quantities, strangeness
and baryon number. It is argued that their correlation and thus also
fluctuations are sensitive to conditions prevailing at the anticipated
parton-hadron phase boundary. Fluctuations of the $(\mathrm{K}^+ +
\mathrm{K}^-)/(\mathrm{p}+\bar{\mathrm{p}})$ and $\mathrm{K}^+/\mathrm{p}$
ratios have been measured for the first time by NA49 in central Pb+Pb
collisions at 5 SPS energies between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 6.3 GeV and 17.3 GeV.
Both ratios exhibit a change of sign in $\sigma_{\mathrm{dyn}}$, a measure of
non-statistical fluctuations, around $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 8 GeV. Below this
energy, $\sigma_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ is positive, indicating higher fluctuation
compared to a mixed event background sample, while for higher energies,
$\sigma_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ is negative, indicating correlated emission of kaons
and protons. The results are compared to UrQMD calculations which which give a
good description at the higher SPS energies, but fail to reproduce the
transition to positive values.
