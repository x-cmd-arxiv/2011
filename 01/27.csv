  error",,,"10.1088/0266-5611/27/9/095008",,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Filtering is a widely used methodology for the incorporation of observed data
into time-evolving systems. It provides an online approach to state estimation
inverse problems when data is acquired sequentially. The Kalman filter plays a
central role in many applications because it is exact for linear systems
subject to Gaussian noise, and because it forms the basis for many approximate
filters which are used in high dimensional systems. The aim of this paper is to
study the effect of model error on the Kalman filter, in the context of linear
wave propagation problems. A consistency result is proved when no model error
is present, showing recovery of the true signal in the large data limit. This
result, however, is not robust: it is also proved that arbitrarily small model
error can lead to inconsistent recovery of the signal in the large data limit.
If the model error is in the form of a constant shift to the velocity, the
filtering and smoothing distributions only recover a partial Fourier expansion,
a phenomenon related to aliasing. On the other hand, for a class of wave
velocity model errors which are time-dependent, it is possible to recover the
filtering distribution exactly, but not the smoothing distribution. Numerical
results are presented which corroborate the theory, and also to propose a
computational approach which overcomes the inconsistency in the presence of
model error, by relaxing the model.

$\gamma(0)$ in the superconducting state at T$\rightarrow$ 0 is very small with
a value of about 0.39 $mJ/mol K^2$. The magnetic field induced enhancement of
the low-T SH exhibits a rough linear feature indicating a nodeless gap. This is
further supported by the scaling based on the s-wave approach of the low-T data
at different magnetic fields. A rough estimate tells that the normal state SH
coefficient $\gamma_n$ is about 6 $\pm$ 0.5 $mJ/mol K^2$ leading to $\Delta
C/\gamma_nT\mid_{T_c}$ = 1.93 and placing this new superconductor in the strong

well-suited to OFDMA-based cellular networks wherein the cells are partitioned

techniques have been typically been evaluated through system-level simulations
using a hexagonal grid for the base station locations. This paper instead
focuses on analytically evaluating the two main types of FFR deployments -
Strict FFR and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) - using a Poisson point process to
model the base station locations. The results are compared with the standard
grid model and an actual urban deployment. Under reasonable special cases for
modern cellular networks, our results reduce to simple closed-form expressions,
which provide insight into system design guidelines and the relative merits of
Strict FFR, SFR, universal reuse, and fixed frequency reuse. We observe that
FFR provides an increase in the sum-rate as well as the well-known benefit of
improved coverage for cell-edge users. Finally, a SINR-proportional resource
allocation strategy is proposed based on the analytical expressions, showing
that Strict FFR provides greater overall network throughput at low traffic
loads, while SFR better balances the requirements of interference reduction and
resource efficiency when the traffic load is high.

transfer in double degenerate binary systems and its impact on the subsequent
evolution. All investigated systems belong to the regime of direct impact,
unstable mass transfer. In all of the investigated cases, even those considered
unstable by conventional stability analysis, we find a long-lived mass transfer
phase continuing for as many as several dozen orbital periods. This settles a
recent debate sparked by a discrepancy between earlier SPH calculations that
showed disruptions after a few orbital periods and newer grid-based studies in
which mass transfer continued for tens of orbits. As we show that these
binaries can survive at small separation for hundreds of orbital periods, their
associated gravitational wave signal should be included when calculating the
gravitational wave foreground (although expected to below LISA's sensitivity at
these high frequencies). We also show that the inclusion of the entropy
increase associated with shock-heating of the accreted material reduces the
number of orbits a binary survives given the same initial conditions, although
the effect is not as pronounced when using the appropriate initial conditions.
The use of accurate initial conditions and a correct treatment of shock heating
allows for a reliable time evolution of the temperature, density, and angular
momentum, which are important when considering thermonuclear events that may
occur during the mass transfer phase and/or after merger. Our treatment allows
us to accurately identify when surface detonations may occur in the lead-up to
the merger, as well as the properties of final merger products.

emit electrons from a single atom at their apex, thus creating a path to an

potential to achieve atom resolved images of nanostructures including
biological molecules. We demonstrate a further advantage of PPM emerging from
the fact that the very low energy electrons employed experience a large elastic
scattering cross section relative to many-keV electrons. Moreover, the
variation of scattering factors as a function of atom type allows for enhanced
elemental contrast. Low energy electrons arguably offer the further advantage
of causing minimum damage to most materials. Model results for small molecules

indicate that a phase contrast is obtainable between elements with

expectation maximization and algorithms based on graph theory. In this latter
case, graphs are generally constructed by taking into account the Euclidian
distance as a similarity measure, and partitioned using spectral methods.
However, these methods are not accurate when the clusters are not well
separated. In addition, it is not possible to automatically determine the
number of clusters. These limitations can be overcome by taking into account
network community identification algorithms. In this work, we propose a
methodology for data clustering based on complex networks theory. We compare
different metrics for quantifying the similarity between objects and take into
account three community finding techniques. This approach is applied to two
real-world databases and to two sets of artificially generated data. By
comparing our method with traditional clustering approaches, we verify that the
proximity measures given by the Chebyshev and Manhattan distances are the most
suitable metrics to quantify the similarity between objects. In addition, the
community identification method based on the greedy optimization provides the
smallest misclassification rates.

applying the method to M62, one of the clusters in our sample. The width of the

applying our dereddening technique, which will significantly help to constrain
the age, distance, and metallicity of the cluster.

this stray eigenvalue leaves the bulk region, a phase transition will occur in
the largest eigenvalue distribution of the Wishart matrix. In this paper we
will compute the asymptotics of the largest eigenvalue distribution when the

disk-dominated spiral galaxies, the largest sample to date with high-resolution
H_alpha velocity fields for bulgeless disks. From these data we derive rotation
curves and the location of the kinematic centers. The galaxy sample was
selected to contain nucleated and non-nucleated galaxies, which allows us to
investigate what impact the gas kinematics in the host disk have on the
presence (or absence) of a nuclear star cluster. In general, we find that the
velocity fields span a broad range of morphologies. While some galaxies show
regular rotation, most have some degree of irregular gas motions. There appears
to be no systematic difference in the kinematics of nucleated and non-nucleated
disks. Due to the large fields of view of the integral field units we use, we
are able to observe the flattening of the rotation curve in almost all of our
sample galaxies. This makes modeling of the velocity fields relatively
straight-forward. Due to the complexities of the velocity fields, we obtain
reliable determinations of the kinematic center for only 6 of our 20 sample
galaxies. For all of these the locations of the nuclear star
cluster/photometric center and the kinematic center agree within the
uncertainties. If we disregard all kinematically irregular galaxies, our study
concludes that nuclear star clusters truly occupy the nuclei, or dynamical
centers, of their hosts. Our results are thus consistent with in-situ formation
of nuclear star clusters. Yet, many well-motivated formation scenarios for
nuclear clusters invoke off-center cluster formation and subsequent sinking of
clusters due to dynamical friction. In that case, our results imply that
dynamical friction in the centers of bulgeless galaxies must be very effective
in driving massive clusters to the kinematic center. (abridged)

investigate the nature of the power-law shape of xi(r), the galaxy two-point
correlation function. Departures from a power law are mainly governed by galaxy
pair counts on small scales, subject to non-linear dynamics. We assume that
galaxies reside within dark matter halos and subhalos and use a semi-analytic
substructure evolution model to study subhalo populations within host halos. We
find that tidal mass loss and, to a lesser degree, dynamical friction deplete
the number of subhalos within larger host halos over time by ~90%, just the
right amount for achieving a power-law xi(r) at z = 0. We find that xi(r)
breaks from a power law at high masses, implying that only galaxies of
luminosities <= Lstar should exhibit power-law clustering. We also demonstrate
that xi(r) evolves from being far from a power law at high redshift, toward a
near power law at z = 0 and deviates in the future. This is mainly caused by
the evolving competition between the accretion and destruction rates of
subhalos, which happen to strike just the right balance at z~0. We show that
key ingredients determining the shape of xi(r) are the fraction of galaxies
that are satellites, the relative difference in mass between the halos of
isolated galaxies and halos that contain a single satellite on average, and the
rareness of halos that host galaxies. These pieces are intertwined and we find
no simple, universal rule for which a power-law xi(r) will occur. However, we
do show that the physics responsible for setting the galaxy content of halos do
not care about the conditions needed to achieve a power law xi(r) and these
conditions are met only in a narrow mass and redshift range. We conclude that
the power-law nature of xi(r) for Lstar and fainter galaxy samples at low
redshift is a cosmic coincidence. (Abridged)

polarization measurements of background galaxies in radio weak gravitational
lensing surveys and investigated the potential impact on the statistical
measurement of cosmic shear. Here we extend this idea to reconstruct maps of
the projected dark matter distribution, or lensing convergence field. The
addition of polarization can, in principle, greatly reduce shape noise due to
the intrinsic dispersion in galaxy ellipticities. We show that maps
reconstructed using this technique in the radio band can be competitive with
those derived using standard lensing techniques which make use of many more
galaxies. In addition, since the reconstruction noise is uncorrelated between
these standard techniques and the polarization technique, their comparison can
serve as a powerful check for systematics and their combination can reduce
noise further. We examine the convergence reconstruction which could be
achieved with two forthcoming facilities: (i) a deep survey, covering 1.75

between the accretion flow and the jets in accreting compact objects. In the
present work, we report new constraints on these issues, through the long term
study of the radio and X-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate H1743-322.
This source is known to be one of the `outliers' of the universal radio/X-ray
correlation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displaying
fainter radio emission for a given X-ray luminosity than expected from the
correlation. Our study shows that the radio and X-ray emission of H1743-322 are
strongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state. However,
this correlation is unusually steep for a black hole X-ray binary: b ~ 1.4
(with L_{Radio} \propto L_{X}^{b}). Below a critical luminosity, the
correlation becomes shallower until it rejoins the standard correlation with b
~ 0.6. Based on these results, we first show that the steep correlation can be
explained if the inner accretion flow is radiatively efficient during the hard
state, in contrast to what is usually assumed for black hole X-ray binaries in
this spectral state. The transition between the steep and the standard
correlation would therefore reflect a change from a radiatively efficient to a
radiatively inefficient accretion flow. Finally, we investigate the possibility
that the discrepancy between `outliers' and `standard' black holes arises from
the outflow properties rather than from the accretion flow.

populating dark matter halos with masses of M_halo=1e10 M_sun at z=8.6, which
is inspired by the recent reported discovery of a galaxy at z=8.6 with strong
Lya line emission. For reasonable model assumptions, we find that winds cause
T_IGM>10% [50%], for the majority of galaxies, even when the Universe is ~80%
[60%] neutral by volume. Thus, the observed strong Lya emission from the
reported z=8.6 galaxy is consistent with a highly neutral IGM. We also
investigate the implications of the recent tentative evidence for a observed
decrease in the `LAE fraction' among drop-out galaxies between z=6 and z=7. If
confirmed, we show that a rapid evolution in x_HI will be required to explain
this observation via the effects of reionization.

reconstruct the surface intensity patterns of non-radial stellar oscillations
in eclipsing binaries. The method needs a geometric model of the binary,
accepts the light curve and the detected pulsation frequencies on input, and on
output yields estimates of the pulsation patterns, in form of images -- thus
allowing a direct identification of the surface mode numbers$(\ell,m)$.
  Since it has minimal modelling requirements and can operate on photometric
observations in arbitrary wavelength bands, DEM is well suited to analyze the
wide-band time series collected by space observatories.
  The method was extensively tested on simulated data, in which almost all
photometrically detectable modes with a latitudinal complexity $\ell-|m|\le 4$
were properly restored. Multimode pulsations can be also reconstructed in a
natural manner, as well as pulsations on components with tilted rotation axis
of known direction. It can also be used in principle to isolate the
contribution of hidden modes from the light curve.
  Sensitivity tests show that moderate errors in the geometric parameters and
the assumed limb darkening can be partially tolerated by the inversion, in the
sense that the lower degree modes are still recoverable. Tidally induced or
mutually resonant pulsations, however, are an obstacle that neither the eclipse
mapping, nor any other inversion technique can ever surpass.
  We conclude that, with reasonable assumptions, Dynamic Eclipse Mapping could
be a powerful tool for mode identification, especially in moderately close
eclipsing binary systems, where the pulsating component is not seriously
affected by tidal interactions so that the pulsations are intrinsic to them,
and not a consequence of the binarity.

and the gas accretion through larger scale filaments generate a turbulent
environment within this region. Due to the short cooling time caused by the
non-equilibrium formation of H2, the supersonic turbulence results in a very
fragmented mass distribution, where dense, gravitationally unstable clumps
emerge from a complex network of dense filaments. At z=10.87, we find
approximately 25 well defined, gravitationally unstable clumps, with masses of
4 x 10^3-9 x 10^5 Msun, temperatures of approximately 300K, and cooling times
much shorter than the free-fall time. Only the initial phase of the collapse of
individual clumps is spatially resolved in the simulation. Depending on the
density reached in the collapse, the estimated average Bonnor-Ebert masses are

Unlike the well known solution under the Newtonian limit (Heath 1977), our
solution takes all general relativistic corrections into account and is hence
valid at both the sub- and super-horizon scales. With this exact solution, we
evaluate cosmological impacts induced by these relativistic corrections. (1)
General relativistic corrections alter the density growth from z=100 to z=0 by
10% at k=0.01h/Mpc and the impact becomes stronger toward larger scales. We
caution the readers that the overdensity is not gauge invariant and the above
statement is restrained to the Newtonian gauge. (2) Relativistic corrections
introduce a k^{-2} scale dependence in the density fluctuation. It mimics a
primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type with $f^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}\sim
1$. This systematical error may become non-negligible for future all sky deep
galaxy surveys. (3) Cosmological simulations with box size greater than 1Gpc
are also affected by these relativistic corrections. We provide a
post-processing recipe to correct for these effects. (4) These relativistic
corrections affect the redshift distortion. However, at redshifts and scales
relevant to redshift distortion measurements, such effect is negligible.

It is difficult to formulate a general theory for star formation in part
because of the wide range of physical processes involved. The interstellar gas
out of which stars form is a supersonically turbulent plasma governed by
magnetohydrodynamics. This is hard enough by itself, since we do not understand
even subsonic hydrodynamic turbulence very well, let alone supersonic non-ideal
MHD turbulence. However, the behavior of star-forming clouds in the ISM is also
obviously influenced by gravity, which adds complexity, and by both continuum
and line radiative processes. Finally, the behavior of star-forming clouds is
influenced by a wide variety of chemical processes, including formation and
destruction of molecules and dust grains (which changes the thermodynamic
behavior of the gas) and changes in ionization state (which alter how strongly
the gas couples to magnetic fields). As a result of these complexities, there
is nothing like a generally agreed-upon theory of star formation, as there is
for stellar structure. Instead, we are forced to take a much more
phenomenological approach. These notes provide an introduction to our current
thinking about how star formation works.

stellar populations (MSPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GGCs). Studying MSPs
and their accumulated data can shed more light on the formation and evolution
of GGCs and other closely related fundamental problems. We focus on the strong
relation between the radial distribution of evolutionary homogeneous stars and
their U-based photometric characteristics in the nearby GGC NGC 6752 and
compare this with a similar relation we found in NGC 3201 and NGC 1261. We use
our new multi-color photometry in a fairly wide field of NGC 6752, with
particular emphasis on the U band and our recent and already published
photometry made in NGC 3201 and NGC 1261. We found and report here for the
first time a strong difference in the radial distribution between the
sub-populations of red giant branch (RGB) stars that are bluer and redder in
color U-B, as well as between sub-giant branch (SGB) stars brighter and fainter
in the U-magnitude in NGC 6752. Moreover, the fainter SGB and redder RGB stars
are similarly much more centrally concentrated than their respective brighter
and bluer counterparts. Virtually the same applies to NGC 3201. We find
evidence in NGC 6752 as in NGC 3201 that a dramatic change in the proportion of
the two sub-populations of SGB and RGB stars occurs at a radial distance close
to the half-mass radius, R_h, of the cluster. These results are the first
detections of the radial trend of the particular photometric properties of
stellar populations in GGCs. They imply a radial dependence of the main
characteristics of the stellar populations in these GGCs, primarily of the
abundance, and (indirectly) presumably of the kinematics.

was that of Lev Landau (1941) in which the fluid is modelled phenomenologically
as an interpenetrating mixture of a superfluid and a normal fluid. It has later
been shown that Landau's two-fluid model can be rigorously derived from a
one-fluid model within the classical fields approximation. Assuming a
separation of scales exists between the slowly varying, large-scale, background
(condensate) field, and the short rapidly evolving excitations, a full
description of the kinetics between the condensate and the thermal cloud can be
obtained. The kinetics describes three-wave and four-wave interactions that
resemble the C_{12} and C_{22} terms, respectively, in the collision integral
of the ZNG theory. The scale separation assumption precludes analysis of the
healing layer and thus does not include the dynamics of quantised vortices.
Whilst the analysis required the use of small parameters arising from the scale
separation assumption and the assumption of a weakly depleted condensate, we
expect the results to hold true over a wider range of parameters. This belief
is motivated by the validity of Landau's two-fluid model which can be derived
from a one-fluid model using nothing more than Galilean invariance principles.
Indeed, we argue that similar arguments can be used to recover a two-fluid
model directly from a classical field simply by invoking a local gauge
transformation. This derivation does not require any small parameters to be
introduced suggesting that the results that lead to the kinetic equations may
turn out to be more general.

statistics of the driving flow are assumed to be instantaneously correlated in
time. Here we compare the results of the model with the dynamo properties of a
simulated flow that has equivalent spatial characteristics as the Kazantsev
flow but different temporal statistics. In particular, the simulated flow is a
solution of the forced Navier-Stokes equations and hence has a finite
correlation time. We find that the Kazantsev model typically predicts a larger
magnetic growth rate and a magnetic spectrum that peaks at smaller scales.
However, we show that by filtering the diffusivity spectrum at small scales it
is possible to bring the growth rates into agreement and simultaneously align
the magnetic spectra.

between the Hund's coupling and the Coulomb interaction. We find that for a
sizable range of Hund's coupling the Mott transition acquires a strong
first-order character, but there also exists a small range of stronger Hund's
coupling in which an enhancement of magnetization can be observed on the SDW
side. We interpret the former scenario as one in which a sharp distinction can
be drawn between LM and the SDW picture, and the latter scenario as one in
which signs of LM physics begin to develop in the metallic phase. It is
tempting to suggest that some FeSC materials are in the vicinity of the latter

Lorentz group where spin connections play a role of gauge fields and Riemann
curvature tensors correspond to their field strengths. One can then pose an
interesting question: What is the Einstein equations from the gauge theory
point of view? Or equivalently, what is the gauge theory object corresponding
to Einstein manifolds? We show that the Einstein equations in four dimensions
are precisely self-duality equations in Yang-Mills gauge theory and so Einstein
manifolds correspond to Yang-Mills instantons in SO(4) = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R
gauge theory. Specifically, we prove that any Einstein manifold with or without
a cosmological constant always arises as the sum of SU(2)_L instantons and
SU(2)_R anti-instantons. This result explains why an Einstein manifold must be
stable because two kinds of instantons belong to different gauge groups,
instantons in SU(2)_L and anti-instantons in SU(2)_R, and so they cannot decay
into a vacuum. We further illuminate the stability of Einstein manifolds by
showing that they carry nontrivial topological invariants.

experimentally validated semiclassical model. This phenomenological approach
bundles the details of underlying noise processes into a single experimentally
relevant noise power spectral density. Our results show that the dominant
features of experimental measurements in a two-electron singlet-triplet spin
qubit can be replicated using a $1/\omega^{2}$ noise power spectrum associated
with nuclear-spin-flips in the host material. Beginning with this validation we
address the effects of nuclear programming, high-frequency nuclear-spin

supported by physical arguments and microscopic calculations where relevant.
Our results provide expected performance bounds and identify diagnostic metrics

  The topics of the papers include the foundations, optimizations and
applications of proof interpretations such as Hilbert's epsilon substitution
method, Goedel's functional interpretation, learning based realizability and
negative translations as well as special calculi and theories capturing

log(L_IR/L_Sun)=10-12, the LF for LIRGs in the Lockman Hole Deep Field is

sRNAs act additively; however, in \textit{V. cholerae}, the sRNAs act
redundantly. Furthermore, there are striking differences in the luminescence
phenotypes for different pathway mutants in \textit{V. harveyi} and \textit{V.
cholerae}. However these differences have not been connected with the observed
differences for the sRNA deletion strains in these bacteria. In this work, we
present a model for quorum sensing induced luminescence phenotypes focusing on
the interactions of multiple sRNAs with target mRNA. Within our model, we find
that one key parameter -- the fold-change in protein concentration necessary
for luminescence activation -- can control whether the sRNAs appear to act
additively or redundantly. For specific parameter choices, we find that
differences in this key parameter can also explain hitherto unconnected
luminescence phenotypes differences for various pathway mutants in \textit{V.
harveyi} and \textit{V. cholerae}. The model can thus provide a unifying
explanation for observed differences in luminescence phenotypes and can also be
used to make testable predictions for future experiments.

of today's Internet as it facilitates innovation also in the network core and
as it promises a more efficient use of the given resources and infrastructure.
Virtual networks (VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network:
multiple VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on
completely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the main
challenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission control and
embedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks (e.g., for a video
conference) can be hard to predict, and once the request is accepted, the
specification / QoS guarantees must be ensured throughout the VNet's lifetime.
This requires an admission control algorithm which only selects high-benefit
VNets in times of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes
the VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be embedded
as well is maximized.
  This article describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet embedding
problem which does not rely on any knowledge of the future VNet requests but
whose performance is competitive to an optimal offline algorithm that has
complete knowledge of the request sequence in advance: the so-called
competitive ratio is, loosely speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the
resources. Our algorithm is generic in the sense that it supports multiple
traffic models, multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform
benefits and durations of VNet requests.

Math. 4 (2012) P120601","10.4303/jpm/P120601",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The auxiliary field method is a new technique to obtain closed formulae for
the solutions of eigenequations in quantum mechanics. The idea is to replace a
Hamiltonian $H$ for which analytical solutions are not known by another one
$\tilde H$, including one or more auxiliary fields. For instance, a potential
$V(r)$ not solvable is replaced by another one $P(r)$ more familiar, or a
semirelativistic kinetic part is replaced by an equivalent nonrelativistic one.
The approximation comes from the replacement of the auxiliary fields by pure
real constants. The approximant solutions for $H$, eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions, are then obtained by the solutions of $\tilde H$ in which the
auxiliary parameters are eliminated by an extremization procedure for the
eigenenergies. If $H=T(\bm p)+V(r)$ and if $P(r)$ is a power law, the
approximate eigenvalues can be written $T(p_0)+V(r_0)$, where the mean
impulsion $p_0$ is a function of the mean distance $r_0$ and where $r_0$ is
determined by an equation which is linked to the generalized virial theorem.
The general properties of the method are studied and the connections with the
envelope theory presented. This method is first applied to nonrelativistic and
semirelativistic two-body systems, with a great variety of potentials. Closed
formulae are produced for energies, eigenstates, various observables and
critical constants, with sometimes a very good accuracy. The method is then
used to solve nonrelativistic and semirelativistic many-body systems with
one-body and two-body interactions. For such cases, analytical solutions can
only be obtained for systems of identical particles, but several systems of
interest for atomic and hadronic physics are studied. General results
concerning the many-body critical constants are presented, as well as duality
relations existing between approximate and exact eigenvalues.

Exact expressions for phonon transmission coefficients are derived for thermal

single-junction case, we find that the phonon transmission coefficient
typically decreases monotonically with increasing freqency. However, in the
range between equal frequency spectrum and equal acoustic impedance, it
increases first then decreases, which explains why the Kapitza resistance
calculated from the acoustic mismatch model is far larger than the experimental
values at low temperatures. The junction thermal conductance reaches a maximum
when the interfacial coupling equals the harmonic average of the spring
constants of the two semi-infinite chains. For three-dimensional junctions, in
the weak coupling limit, we find that the conductance is proportional to the
square of the interfacial coupling, while for intermediate coupling strength
the conductance is approximately proportional to the interfacial coupling
strength. For two-junction chains, the transmission coefficient oscillates with
the frequency due to interference effects. The oscillations between the two
envelop lines can be understood analytically, thus providing guidelines in
designing phonon frequency filters.

renormalized couplings between the leads and the dot in the equilibrium states
characterize the peak formation in the nonequilibrium differential conductance.
In particular, in the Kondo regime, the enhancement of the Andreev transport
via a Kondo resonance occurs in the differential conductance at a finite bias
voltage, leading to an anomalous peak whose position is given by the
renormalized parameters. In addition to the peak, we show that the energy
levels of the Andreev bound states give rise to other peaks in the differential
conductance in the strongly correlated N-QD-S system. All these features of the
nonequilibrium transport are consistent with those in the recent experimental

despite the fact that they have significantly different formation temperatures
in ionization equilibrium: log T/K = 5.6 and 5.8. These issues are important to
resolve because confidence has been undermined in their use for DEM analysis,
and Fe VIII is the main contributor to the AIA 131A channel at low
temperatures. Furthermore, they are the best EIS lines to use for velocity
studies, and for assigning the correct temperature to velocity measurements in
the fans. We find that the Fe VIII 185.213A line is particularly sensitive to
the slope of the DEM, leading to disproportionate changes in its effective
formation temperature. If the DEM has a steep gradient in the log T/K = 5.6 to
5.8 range, or is strongly peaked, Fe VIII 185.213A and Si VII 275.368A will be
formed at the same temperature. We show that this effect explains the
similarity of these images in the fans. Furthermore, we show that the most
recent ionization balance compilations resolve the discrepancies in absolute
intensities. We then combine EIS and AIA to determine the temperature structure
of a number of fan loops and find that they have peak temperatures of
0.8--1.2MK. The EIS data indicate that the temperature distribution has a
finite (but narrow) width < log sigma/K = 5.5 which, in one case, is found to
broaden substantially towards the loop base. AIA and EIS yield similar results
on the temperature, emission measure, and thermal distribution in the fans,
though sometimes the AIA data suggest a relatively larger thermal width. The
result is that both the Fe VIII 185.213A and Si VII 275.368A lines are formed
at log T/K ~ 5.9 in the fans, and the AIA 131A response also shifts to this

The size of the system can be extracted from the Bose-Einstein quantum

correlations that shift the baseline of the correlation function from the
expected flat behavior. A possible source of these correlations is the
conservation of energy and momentum, especially for small systems, where the
energy available for particle production is limited. A new technique, first

with the Mean curvature and shifts the Fermi energy of the material

quantum relativistic fields, which would be otherwise equivalent, are in fact
inequivalent if the second law of thermodynamics is taken into account. The
proof of the inequivalence is based on the analysis of a macroscopic system at
full thermodynamical equilibrium with a macroscopic total angular momentum and
a specific instance is given for the free Dirac field, for which we show that
the canonical and Belinfante stress-energy tensors are not equivalent. For this
particular case, we show that the difference between the predicted angular
momentum densities for a rotating system at full thermodynamical equilibrium is
a quantum effect, persisting in the non-relativistic limit, corresponding to a
polarization of particles of the order of \hbar \omega/KT (\omega being the
angular velocity) and could in principle be measured experimentally. This
result implies that specific stress-energy and spin tensors are physically
meaningful even in the absence of gravitational coupling and raises the issue
of finding the thermodynamically right (or the right class of) tensors. We
argue that the maximization of the thermodynamic potential theoretically allows
to discriminate between two different couples, yet for the present we are
unable to provide a theoretical method to single out the ""best"" couple of
tensors in a given quantum field theory. The existence of a non-vanishing spin
tensor would have major consequences in hydrodynamics, gravity and cosmology.

differences of contributions of states from [Pt2As2] and [Pt2As2] blocks into

essential charge anisotropy between the adjacent [Pt2As2] and [As2Pt2] blocks.

In the optically thin, isothermal regime, where the discontinuity is chemical

region), radiation acts as part of an effective gravitational field, and
instability arises if the effective gravity per unit volume toward the

studied by means of a period analysis only. Many new times of minima for both

result is the discovery that both systems have eccentric orbits. For V456 Oph
we deal with the eccentric eclipsing binary system with the shortest orbital
period known (about 1.016 day), while the apsidal motion period is about 23

the resulting conductivities can be approximately described by the anisotropic

demonstrate that this simple model is quantitatively correct for a single Dirac

tributed to the CR streaming due to the discrete distribution of CR sources or
local magnetic field modulation. Recently, the two dimensional large scale CR
anisotropy has been measured by many experiments in TeV-PeV energy range in
both hemispheres. The tail-in excess along the tangential direction of the
local spiral arm and the loss cone deficit pointing to the north Galactic pole
direction agree with what have been obtained in tens to hundreds of GeV. The
persistence of the two large scale anisotropy structures in such a wide range

the Galactic CRs (GCRs). This work tries to extend the observed CR anisotropy
picture from solar system to the whole galaxy. In such a case, we can find a
new interesting signature, a loop of GCR streaming, of the GCR propagation. We
further calculate the overall GCR streaming induced magnetic field, and find a
qualitative consistence with the observed structure of the halo magnetic field.

a subgraph H in G isomorphic to a subdivision of the complete graph K4 on four
vertices such that G-V(H) is connected and contains x. This implies an
affirmative answer to a question of W. Kuehnel whether every 4-connected graph
G contains a subdivision H of K4 as a subgraph such that G-V(H) is connected.
The motor for our induction is a result of Fontet and Martinov stating that
every 4-connected graph can be reduced to a smaller one by contracting a single
edge, unless the graph is the square of a cycle or the line graph of a cubic
graph. It turns out that this is the only ingredience of the proof where
4-connectedness is used. We then generalize our result to connected graphs of
minimum degree at least 4, by developing the respective motor: A structure
theorem for the class of simple connected graphs of minimum degree at least 4.

process is equilibrated by its reverse process. For many real physico-chemical
complex systems (e.g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic
oxidation, most enzyme reactions etc), detailed mechanisms include both
reversible and irreversible reactions. In this case, the principle of detailed
balance cannot be applied directly. We represent irreversible reactions as
limits of reversible steps and obtain the principle of detailed balance for
complex mechanisms with some irreversible elementary processes. We proved two
consequences of the detailed balance for these mechanisms: the structural
condition and the algebraic condition that form together the extended form of
detailed balance. The algebraic condition is the principle of detailed balance
for the reversible part. The structural condition is: the convex hull of the
stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection
with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reaction.
Physically, this means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in
oriented pathways. The systems with the extended form of detailed balance are
also the limits of the reversible systems with detailed balance when some of
the equilibrium concentrations (or activities) tend to zero. Surprisingly, the
structure of the limit reaction mechanism crucially depends on the relative
speeds of this tendency to zero.

redistribution of laser energy absorbed by the substrate causes
self-organization of polymer thin-film in the form of wrinkle like surface

Unlike the conventional laser ablation and laser writing processes, low laser

incident radiation. Self-organization in the thin polymer film aided by the
diffraction pattern produces micro-structures made up of thin raised lines.
These regular microstructures have far more complex morphologies than the mask
geometry and very narrow line widths that can be an order of magnitude smaller
than the openings in the mask. The microstructure morphology is easily
modulated by changing the film thickness, aperture size and geometry and by
changing the diffraction pattern, e.g., by changing the aperture-substrate

of wind shells is efficiently decelerated by the relativistic pressure; their
bulk motion however is preserved so they cross the bubble together with the
parent star. The wind material occupies a small fraction of bubble volume and
does not affect substantially the expansion of SN remnants. The estimated
maximal radius of a SN remnant in the bubble is 30-40 pc, if the envelope keeps
its integrity and remains spherical. A fragmentation of SN shell due to
Rayleigh-Taylor instability can alleviate the propagation of the SN material so
the ejecta fragments are able to cross the relativistic bubble. Outside the
bubble wind shells and supernova fragments are decelerated in the intracluster
medium at close range off the bubble boundary. The deposited SNe Ia material
can enrich the intracluster gas with metals in a thin layer at the boundary of
the relativistic bubble. This process may lead to a rim of enhanced line
emission. In the opposite limit, when the fragmentation of supernova remnant is
moderate or absent, the SN Ia matter is advected by the relativistic plasma and
may leave the central region of the bright cluster galaxy together with
buoyantly moving bubbles.

investigate the impact of clumping on diagnostic ultraviolet resonance and
optical recombination lines. Optically thick clumps, a non-void interclump
medium, and a non-monotonic velocity field are all accounted for in a single
model. We used 2D and 3D stochastic and radiation-hydrodynamic (RH) wind
models, constructed by assembling 1D snapshots in radially independent slices.
To compute synthetic spectra, we developed and used detailed radiative transfer
codes for both recombination lines (solving the ""formal integral"") and
resonance lines (using a Monte-Carlo approach). In addition, we propose an
analytic method to model these lines in clumpy winds, which does not rely on
optically thin clumping. Results: Synthetic spectra calculated directly from
current RH wind models of the line-driven instability are unable to in parallel
reproduce strategic optical and ultraviolet lines for the Galactic O-supergiant
LCep. Using our stochastic wind models, we obtain consistent fits essentially
by increasing the clumping in the inner wind. A mass-loss rate is derived that
is approximately two times lower than predicted by the line-driven wind theory,
but much higher than the corresponding rate derived from spectra when assuming
optically thin clumps. Our analytic formulation for line formation is used to
demonstrate the potential impact of optically thick clumping in weak-winded
stars and to confirm recent results that resonance doublets may be used as
tracers of wind structure and optically thick clumping. (Abridged)

graphene layers with well defined edges. We microscopically analyze the
boundary problem for the continuous Bogoliubov-de Gennes-Dirac (BdGD) equations
and derive the Green functions for normal and superconducting graphene layers.
Importing the idea used in tight-binding (TB) models of a microscopic hopping
that couples different regions, we are able to set up and solve an algebraic
Dyson's equation describing a graphene-superconductor junction. For this
coupled system we analytically derive the Green functions and use them to
calculate the local density of states and the spatial variation of the induced
pairing correlations in the normal region. Signatures of specular Andreev
reflections are identified.
