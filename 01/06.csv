Theory. Due to the absence of pressure gradients, quintessence and dark matter
are comoving and can be studied as a unique fluid in terms of the total energy
density contrast and the common velocity. In this description the clustering of
quintessence enhances the linear term proportional to the velocity divergence
in the continuity equation by a factor (1+w) Omega_Q / Omega_m. This is
responsible for a rapid evolution of the growth rate at low redshifts, and
modifies the standard relation between the velocity divergence and the growth
factor. For the total fluid, the solutions for the linear growth function and
growth rate can be written in integral forms and admit simple fitting formulae,
as in the LambdaCDM case. At second order in perturbation theory, we derive an
explicit expression for the kernels F_2 and G_2. They receive modifications of
the order of the ratio between quintessence and total energy density
perturbations, which affect the corresponding tree-level bispectra. We finally
compute the cumulative signal-to-noise in the power spectrum, bispectrum and
reduced bispectrum, expected for departures from a LambdaCDM cosmology both in

particular, receives sensible modifications only in the clustering case and can
potentially be used to detect or rule out the model.

Of key importance is the demonstration that an extended orbital angular

states with half-integer projection quantum numbers ""m"" along the axis of
quantization, while still preserving integer-valued orbital quantum numbers ""l""
for a simply connected topology. The consequences of this possibility are
explored in depth, noting that the half-integer ""m"" states vanish as required
when the locally curved space-time reduces to flat space-time, fully recovering
all established properties of orbital angular momentum in this limit. In
particular, it is shown that a minimum orbital number of ""l = 2"" is necessary

small solids as the latter are ""frozen-in"" into gas and are peeled off together
with it. These small solids are then mixed with the ambient cold disc

series analysis methods fail to properly compute the largest Lyapounov exponent
even for very large data sets, whereas the computational effort of the 0-1 test
remains the same in the whole range of values of the energy density considered
with moderate size time series. Therefore, our results show that, for a
qualitative probing of phase space, the 0-1 test can be an effective tool if
its limitations are properly taken into account.

to describe the meaning of programming languages. Oftentimes, it is felt
necessary to keep a semantics small, for example to facilitate its use for
model checking by avoiding state space explosion. However, omitting many
details in a semantics typically makes results valid for a limited core
language only, leaving a wide gap towards any real implementation. In this
paper we present a full-fledged semantics of the concurrent object-oriented
programming language SCOOP (Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming). The
semantics has been found detailed enough to guide an implementation of the
SCOOP compiler and runtime system, and to detect and correct a variety of
errors and ambiguities in the original informal specification and prototype
implementation. In our formal specification, we use abstract data types with
preconditions and axioms to describe the state, and introduce a number of
special run-time operations to model the runtime system with our inference
rules. This approach allows us to make our large formal specification
manageable, providing a first step towards reference documents for specifying
object-oriented languages based on operational semantics.

be divided between linear and nonlinear versions. Linear models, including the
BA model (Brabasi and Albert, 1999), assume that the average activity of users
is a constant independent of population. Hence the total activity is a linear
function of population. On the contrary, nonlinear models suggest that the
average activity is affected by the size of the population and the total
activity is a nonlinear function of population. In the current study,
supporting evidences for the nonlinear growth assumption are obtained from data
on Internet users' tagging behavior. A power law relationship between the
number of new tags (F) and the population (P), which can be expressed as F ~ P
^ gamma (gamma > 1), is found. I call this pattern accelerating growth and find

to a receiver by transmitting a codeword x =(x_1,...,x_n) in {0,1}^n bit by bit
via a channel limited to at most pn corruptions. The channel is online in the
sense that at the ith step the channel decides whether to flip the ith bit or
not and its decision is based only on the bits transmitted so far, i.e.,
(x_1,...,x_i). This is in contrast to the classical adversarial channel in
which the corruption is chosen by a channel that has full knowledge on the sent
codeword x. The best known lower bound on the capacity of both the online
channel and the classical adversarial channel is the well-known
Gilbert-Varshamov bound. In this paper we prove a lower bound on the capacity
of the online channel which beats the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for any positive
p such that H(2p) < 0.5 (where H is the binary entropy function). To do so, we
prove that for any such p, a code chosen at random combined with the nearest
neighbor decoder achieves with high probability a rate strictly higher than the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound (for the online channel).

modular completion of a mock modular form. The derivation provides a physical
interpretation to the non-holomorphic part as arising from a difference in
spectral densities for the continuous part of the right-moving bosonic and
fermionic spectrum. The spectral asymmetry can also be read off directly from
the reflection amplitudes of the theory. By performing an orbifold, we show how
our twisted elliptic genus generalizes an existing example.

component of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the heliosphere. As pump
waves they are prone to parametric instability by which they can generate
cyclotron and acoustic daughter waves. Here we revisit a related process within
the framework of the multi-fluid equations for a plasma consisting of many
species. The nonlinear coupling of the Alfv\'en wave to acoustic waves is
studied, and a set of compressive and coupled wave equations for the transverse
magnetic field and longitudinal electric field is derived for waves propagating
along the mean-field direction. It turns out that slightly compressive Alfv\'en
waves exert, through induced gyro-radius and kinetic-energy modulations, an
electromotive force on the particles in association with a longitudinal
electric field, which has a potential that is given by the gradient of the
transverse kinetic energy of the particles gyrating about the mean field. This
in turn drives electric fluctuations (sound and ion-acoustic waves) along the
mean magnetic field, which can nonlinearly react back on the transverse
magnetic field. Mutually coupled Alfv\'en-cyclotron-acoustic waves are thus
excited, a nonlinear process that can drive a cascade of wave energy in the
plasma and may generate compressive microturbulence. These driven electric
fluctuations might have consequences for the dissipation of MHD turbulence and,
thus, for the heating and acceleration of particles in the solar wind.

We also study how the capacitance is reduced when the electrode is an imperfect

approximated as a perfect metal because of its strong nonlinear screening. In
this way the experimentally-measured capacitance values of ~ 100 F/cm^3 may be
understood.

shows that the luminosity of the Class 0 object is 0.14 $-$ 0.16 L$_{\odot}$,
which is a low luminosity for a protostellar object. In order to constrain the
chemical characteristics of the core having the low luminosity object, we
compare our molecular line observations to models of lines including abundance
variations. We tested both ad hoc step function abundance models and a series
of self-consistent chemical evolution models. In the chemical evolution models,
we consider a continuous accretion model and an episodic accretion model to
explore how variable luminosity affects the chemistry. The step function
abundance models can match observed lines reasonably well. The best fitting
chemical evolution model requires episodic accretion and the formation of
CO$_2$ ice from CO ice during the low luminosity periods. This process removes
C from the gas phase, providing a much improved fit to the observed gas-phase
molecular lines and the CO$_2$ ice absorption feature. Based on the chemical

studied, two of which have an observed balance of the magnetic flux. The
magnetic helicity injection rate measured is found to depend little on the
window size selected, but does depend on the time interval used between the two
successive magnetograms tracked. It is found that the measurement of the
magnetic helicity injection rate performs well for a window size between 12x10

short-lived magnetic structures, 10-60 minutes, are found to contribute 30-50%

function of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). We also compute the mass
of low-mass stars ejected, and the amount of hydrogen ionising photons emitted
by the proto globular clusters. Typically, we find that the initial masses of
GCs must be ~8-10 times (or up to 25 times, if second generation stars also
escape from GCs) larger than the present-day stellar mass. The present-day
Galactic GC population must then have contributed to approximately 5-8%
(10-20%) of the low-mass stars in the Galactic halo. We also show that the
detection of second generation stars in the Galactic halo, recently announced
by different groups, provides a new constraint on the GC initial mass function
(GCIMF). These observations appear to rule out a power-law GCIMF, whereas they
are compatible with a log-normal one. Finally, the high initial masses also
imply that GCs must have emitted a large amount of ionising photons in the
early Universe. Our results reopen the question on the initial mass function of
GCs, and reinforce earlier conclusions that old GCs could have represented a
significant contribution to reionise the inter-galactic medium at high

contribution of each coordination state to its excess chemical potential, using
a molecular aufbau approach. In this approach, we define a coordination sphere,
the inner-shell, and separate the excess chemical potential into packing,
outer-shell, and local chemical contributions; the coordination state is
defined by the number of solvent water molecules within the coordination
sphere. The packing term accounts for the free energy of creating a solute-free
coordination sphere in the liquid. The outer-shell term accounts for the
interaction of the solute with the fluid outside the coordination sphere and it
is accurately described by a Gaussian model of hydration for coordination radii
greater than the minimum of the oxygen-oxygen pair correlation function.
Consistent with the conventional radial cut-off used for defining
hydrogen-bonds in liquid water, theory helps identify a chemically meaningful
coordination radius. The local chemical contribution is recast as a sum over
coordination states. The n-th term in this sum is given by the probability of
observing n water molecules inside the coordination sphere in the absence of
the solute water times a factor accounting for the interaction of the solute
with the inner-shell solvent water molecules. Using this molecular aufbau
expansion, we monitor the change in the chemical contribution due to the
incremental increase in n. We find that though four water molecules are needed
to fully account for the chemical term, the first added water accounts for
nearly half the chemical term. Our results emphasize the need to acknowledge
the intrinsic occupancy of a solute-free coordination sphere together with
solute-solvent interactions in rationalizing the tetrahedral coordination of
the solute water.

turbulent viscosity whereas in MHD, the numerical resolution employed may be
insufficient. When imposing a uniform magnetic field to the flow, we observe a
lack of saturation of the formation of small scales together with a significant
slowing-down of their equilibration, with however a cut-off independent partial
thermalization being reached at intermediate scales.

self-adjoint in $L^2({\mathbb R}^2)$. Here ${\bf A}$ is a magnetic potential
which generates a constant magnetic field $b>0$, and the edge potential $W =
\bar{W}$ is a ${\mathcal T}$-periodic non constant bounded function depending
only on the first coordinate $x \in {\mathbb R}$ of $(x,y) \in {\mathbb R}^2$.
Then the spectrum $\sigma(H_0)$ of $H_0$ has a band structure, the band
functions are $b {\mathcal T}$-periodic, and generically there are infinitely
many open gaps in $\sigma(H_0)$. We establish explicit sufficient conditions
which guarantee that a given band of $\sigma(H_0)$ has a positive length, and
all the extremal points of the corresponding band function are non degenerate.
Under these assumptions we consider the perturbed operators $H_{\pm} = H_0 \pm
V$ where the electric potential $V \in L^{\infty}({\mathbb R}^2)$ is
non-negative and decays at infinity. We investigate the asymptotic distribution
of the discrete spectrum of $H_\pm$ in the spectral gaps of $H_0$. We introduce
an effective Hamiltonian which governs the main asymptotic term; this
Hamiltonian could be interpreted as a 1D Schroedinger operator with
infinite-matrix-valued potential. Further, we restrict our attention on
perturbations $V$ of compact support. We find that there are infinitely many
discrete eigenvalues in any open gap in the spectrum of $\sigma(H_0)$, and the
convergence of these eigenvalues to the corresponding spectral edge is
asymptotically Gaussian.

to the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faint
sub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. Instead, their
average properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular power
spectrum of the background intensity variations. A previous attempt at
measuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clustering
amplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halo
model. Here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over the
linear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum of
brightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. From this excess, we find
that sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimum
mass of log[M_min/M_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. This minimum dark
matter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for star
formation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analytical

of the hosts. We find that for all but one burst in our sample the offsets are
consistent with this model. For the case of bursts with massive elliptical host
galaxies, the circular velocities of the hosts' haloes exceed the natal
velocities of almost all our compact object binaries. Hence the extents of the
predicted offset distributions for elliptical galaxies are determined largely
by their spatial extents. In contrast, for spiral hosts the galactic rotation
velocities are smaller than typical binary natal velocities and the predicted
burst offset distributions are more extended than the galaxies.
  One SGRB, 060502B, apparently has a large radial offset that is inconsistent
with an origin in a merging galactic compact binary. Although it is plausible
that the host of GRB 060502B is mis-identified, our results show that the large

wavelengths for various molecular clouds and different laws have been obtained.
In this paper we seek variations of the extinction law within the Trifid nebula
region. Such variations would demonstrate a local dust evolution linked to
variation of the environment parameters such as the density or the interstellar
radiation field. The extinction values, A_lambda/A_V, are obtained using the
2MASS, UKIDSS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE surveys. The technique is to inter-calibrate
color-excess maps from different wavelengths to derive the extinction law and
to map the extinction in the Trifid region. We measured the extinction law at
3.6, 4.5, and 5.8 um and we found a transition at A_V ~ 20 mag. Below this
threshold the extinction law is as expected from models for R_V=5.5 whereas
above 20 mag of visual extinction, it is flatter. Using these results the
color-excess maps are converted into a composite extinction map of the Trifid
nebula at a spatial resolution of 1 arcmin. A tridimensional analysis along the
line-of-sight allowed us to estimate a distance of 2.7 kpc for the Trifid. The
comparison of the extinction with the 1.25 mm emission suggests the millimeter
emissivity is enhanced in the dense condensations of the cloud. Our results
suggest a dust transition at large extinction which has not been reported so

z~2 and 60% of its stars by z~1, regardless of current morphological type; (2)
the mean SFHs of dIs, dTrans, and dSphs are similar over most of cosmic time,

the mean values are inconsistent with simple SFH models, e.g., exponentially
declining SFRs. The mean SFHs are in general agreement with the cosmic SFH,
although we observe offsets near z~1 that could be evidence that low mass
systems experienced delayed star formation relative to more massive galaxies.
The sample shows a strong density-morphology relationship, such that the dSphs
are less isolated than dIs. We find that the transition from a gas-rich to
gas-poor galaxy cannot be solely due to internal mechanisms such as stellar
feedback, and instead is likely the result of external mechanisms, e.g., ram
pressure and tidal forces. The average transition dwarf is slightly less
isolated and less gas-rich than the typical dI. Further, the transition dwarfs
can be divided into two groups: interacting and gas-poor or isolated and
gas-rich, suggesting two possible evolutionary pathways.

that the surrounding extracellular medium is resistive and uniform, and in some

dipoles. Because of these assumptions, this standard model does not correctly
describe the contributions of monopolar sources or of non-resistive aspects of
the extracellular medium. We propose here a general framework to model electric
fields and potentials resulting from current source densities, without relying
on the above assumptions. We develop a mean-field formalism which is a
generalization of the standard model, and which can directly incorporate
non-resistive (non-ohmic) properties of the extracellular medium, such as ionic
diffusion effects. This formalism recovers the classic results of the standard
model such as the CSD analysis, but in addition, we provide expressions to
generalize the CSD approach to situations with non-resistive media and
arbitrarily complex multipolar configurations of current sources. We found that
the power spectrum of the signal contains the signature of the nature of
current sources and extracellular medium, which provides a direct way to
estimate those properties from experimental data, and in particular, estimate
the possible contribution of electric monopoles.

post-main-sequence stars in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104).
This is accomplished by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to
existing optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy, to produce a true
Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. We confirm the cluster's distance as 4611 (+213,
-200) pc and age as 12 +/- 1 Gyr. Horizontal branch models appear to confirm
that no more RGB mass loss occurs in 47 Tuc than in the more-metal-poor omega
Centauri, though difficulties arise due to inconsistencies between the models.
Using our SEDs, we identify those stars which exhibit infrared excess, finding
excess only among the brightest giants: dusty mass loss begins at a luminosity
of ~ 1000 Lsun, becoming ubiquitous above 2000 Lsun. Recent claims of dust
production around lower-luminosity giants cannot be reproduced, despite using
the same archival Spitzer imagery.

source in these winds. Typical evolutionary timescales of AGB stars suggest the
mass-loss rates we report are too high. We suggest that this is because the
iron grains are small or elongated and/or that iron condenses more efficiently
than at solar metallicity. Comparison to other works suggests metallic iron is
observed to be more prevalent towards lower metallicities. The reasons for this
are explored, but remain unclear. Meanwhile, the luminosity at which dusty mass
loss begins is largely invariant with metallicity, but its presence correlates
strongly with long-period variability. This suggests that the winds of low-mass
stars have a significant driver that is not radiation pressure, but may be
acoustic driving by pulsations.

to be powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields (hence dubbed magnetars). The
diversity of their observed behaviours is however not understood, and made even
more puzzling by the discovery of magnetar-like bursts from ""low-field""

magnetic stresses in the crust; these, together with recent calculations of the
breaking stress of the neutron star crust, allow us to establish when
starquakes occur. For the first time, we provide a quantitative estimate of the
burst energetics, event rate, and location on the neutron star surface, which
bear a direct relevance for the interpretation of the overall magnetar

""AXP-like"" object or a ""high-$B$ radio pulsar"", but there is no fundamental

gamma-ray burst (GRB) with an extremely long duration of T90~1020 s, as
observed with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We present spectral
analysis of all three distinct emission episodes using data from Fermi/GBM.
Because of the long nature of this event, many ground-based optical telescopes
slewed to its location within a few minutes and thus were able to observe the
GRB during its active period. We compare the optical and gamma-ray light
curves. Furthermore, we estimate a lower limit on the bulk Lorentz factor from
the variability and spectrum of the GBM light curve and compare it with that
obtained from the peak time of the forward shock of the optical afterglow. From
the spectral analysis we note that, despite its unusually long duration, this
burst is similar to other long GRBs, i.e. there is spectral evolution (both the
peak energy and the spectral index vary with time) and spectral lags are
measured. We find that the optical light curve is highly anti-correlated to the
prompt gamma-ray emission, with the optical emission reaching the maximum
during an epoch of quiescence in the prompt emission. We interpret this
behavior as the reverse shock (optical flash), expected in the
internal-external shock model of GRB emission but observed only in a handful of
GRBs so far. The lower limit on the initial Lorentz factor deduced from the
variability time scale ($\Gamma_{min}=195_{-110}^+{90}$)is consistent within
the error to the one obtained using the peak time of the forward shock
($\Gamma_0=120$) and is also consistent with Lorentz factors of other long
GRBs.

concentrations. This significantly reduces the number of equations necessary to
model such systems. We prove the validity of this approximation using geometric
singular perturbation theory and results about matrix differentiation. The
ideas used in deriving the approximating equations are quite general, and can
be used to systematize other model reductions.

it in one case, which constrains the OA Galactocentric radius to 9<R_{G}<18

some species are possibly mildly depleted by dust. The similarity of the OA

(i.e. traces strong shocks with higher than average temperature and density).
All class I masers were found to originate at the same spatial location (within

R_d\equiv\kappa Dv_{sh}/c, where \kappa is the opacity and v_{sh} is the shock

with an ionization parameter of $\xi=10^{-4}$ erg cm s$^{-1}$, and an oxygen
column density of $N_{\mathrm{O}}\approx 8-10\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$. Our
models are able to reproduce both the K edge and the K$\alpha$ absorption line
from O {\sc i}, which are the two main features in this region. We find no

atomic data for the inner-shell of the iron and oxygen isonuclear sequences. We
concentrate our analysis to the 2-10 keV energy region, and in particular to
the iron K-shell emission lines. We show the dependency of the equivalent width
(EW) of the Fe K$\alpha$ with the ionization parameter. The maximum value of
the EW is $\sim 800$ eV for models with log $\xi\sim 1.5$, and decreases
monotonically as $\xi$ increases. For lower values of $\xi$ the Fe K$\alpha$ EW
decreases to a minimum near log $\xi\sim 0.8$. We produce simulated CCD
observations based on our reflection models. For low ionized, reflection
dominated cases, the 2-10 keV energy region shows a very broad, curving
continuum that cannot be represented by a simple power-law. We show that in
addition to the Fe K-shell emission, there are other prominent features such as
the Si and S L$\alpha$ lines, a blend of Ar {\sc viii-xi} lines, and the Ca
{\sc x} K$\alpha$ line. In some cases the S {\sc xv} blends with the He-like Si
RRC producing a broad feature that cannot be reproduced by a simple Gaussian
profile. This could be used as a signature of reflection.

The correlation is both parity- and naively time-reversal-odd, so that it
vanishes in the Standard Model save for effects induced by final-state

of CP violation beyond the Standard Model, and such couplings, being
spin-independent, are not constrained by the nonobservation of the neutron

operator expansion product method. The dynamic structure factor is therefore
determined by its second-order expansion function with an overall normalization
factor given by Tan's contact parameter. We show that the spin parallel and

combining this amplifier with a beamsplitter, we also demonstrate approximate
cloning of coherent states where an anticlone is present. We investigate the
reversibility by reconstructing the initial state from the output correlations,

characterization of the amplifier and cloner is given by using coherent states
with several different mean values as inputs. Our amplifier is based on linear
optics, offline preparation of nonclassical ancillas, and homodyne measurements

graphene nanoribbon (GNR), a narrow strip of graphene that can have different
chirality depending on the angle at which it is cut. Such GNRs have been
predicted to exhibit a wide range of behaviour (depending on their chirality
and width) that includes tunable energy gaps and the presence of unique
one-dimensional (1D) edge states with unusual magnetic structure. Most GNRs
explored experimentally up to now have been characterized via electrical
conductivity, leaving the critical relationship between electronic structure
and local atomic geometry unclear (especially at edges). Here we present a
sub-nm-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS)
study of GNRs that allows us to examine how GNR electronic structure depends on
the chirality of atomically well-defined GNR edges. The GNRs used here were
chemically synthesized via carbon nanotube (CNT) unzipping methods that allow
flexible variation of GNR width, length, chirality, and substrate. Our STS
measurements reveal the presence of 1D GNR edge states whose spatial
characteristics closely match theoretical expectations for GNR's of similar
width and chirality. We observe width-dependent splitting in the GNR edge state
energy bands, providing compelling evidence of their magnetic nature. These
results confirm the novel electronic behaviour predicted for GNRs with
atomically clean edges, and thus open the door to a whole new area of
applications exploiting the unique magnetoelectronic properties of chiral GNRs.

is studied. In the model, the opinion is continuous, and both the lattice and
the opinion can be either periodic or non-periodic. At each time step, all
agents move randomly on the lattice, and update their opinions based on those
of neighbors with whom the differences of opinions are not greater than a given
threshold. Due to the effect of repeated averaging, opinions first converge
locally, and eventually reach steady states. Like other models with bounded
confidence, steady states in general are those with one or more opinion groups,
in which all agents have the same opinion. When both the lattice and the
opinion are periodic, however, metastable states, in which the whole spectrum
of location-dependent opinions can coexist, can emerge. This result shows that,
when a set of continuous opinions forms a structure like a circle, other that a
typically-used linear opinions, rich dynamic behavior can arise. When there are
geographical restrictions in reality, a complete consensus is rarely reached,
and metastable states here can be one of the explanations for these situations,
especially when opinions are not linear.

(VLBI) ob- servations carried out with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry
(VERA) array and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) toward H2O masers in a

resulting distance is D = 3.9+0.7 kpc. -0.5 This is the first time that the
parallax of a planetary nebula is obtained by observations of its maser
emission. On the other hand, the proper motion of K 3-35 as a whole was esti-
mated to be {\mu}{\alpha} = -3.34+/-0.10 mas yr-1, {\mu}{\delta} = -5.93+/-0.07
mas yr-1. From these results we determined the position and velocity of K 3-35
in Galactic cylindrical coordinates: (R,{\theta},z) = (7.11+0.08-0.06 kpc,
27+/-5{\circ}, 140+25-18 pc) and (VR, V{\theta}, Vz) = (33+/-16, 233+/-11,

measured the relative proper motions among the water maser spots located in the
central region of the nebula, which have been proposed to be tracing a toroidal
structure. The distribution and relative proper motions of the masers, compared
with previous reported observed epochs, suggest that such structure could be
totally destroyed within a few years, due to the action of high velocity winds
and the expansion of the ionization front in the nebula.

it might happen that the observed data are either truncated below a given
threshold and/or might not be reliable enough below that threshold because of
the recording devices. These situations occur, in particular, with radio
audience data measured using personal meters that record environmental noise
every minute, that is then matched to one of the several radio programs. There
are therefore genuine zeros for respondents not listening to the radio, but
also zeros corresponding to real listeners for whom the match between the
recorded noise and the radio program could not be achieved. Since radio
audiences are important for radio broadcasters in order, for example, to
determine advertisement price policies, possibly according to the type of
audience at different time points, it is essential to be able to explain not
only the probability of listening to a radio but also the average time spent
listening to the radio by means of the characteristics of the listeners. In
this paper we propose a generalized linear model for zero-inflated truncated
Pareto distribution (ZITPo) that we use to fit audience radio data. Because it
is based on the generalized Pareto distribution, the ZITPo model has nice
properties such as model invariance to the choice of the threshold and from
which a natural residual measure can be derived to assess the model fit to the
data. From a general formulation of the most popular models for zero-inflated
data, we derive our model by considering successively the truncated case, the
generalized Pareto distribution and then the inclusion of covariates to explain
the nonzero proportion of listeners and their average listening time. By means
of simulations, we study the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator
(and derived inference) and use the model to fully analyze the audience data of
a radio station in a certain area of Switzerland.

mechanistic approaches based on ordinary differential equations have also been
proposed. These latter models are constructed according to biological knowledge

difficulty in the context of primary HIV infection is that the date of

matrix over a non-commutative algebra. In particular, we ask the question,
""over which algebras, is the determinant easier to compute than the permanent?""
Towards resolving this question, we show the following hardness and easiness of
noncommutative determinant computation.
  * [Hardness] Computing the determinant of an n \times n matrix whose entries
are themselves 2 \times 2 matrices over a field is as hard as computing the
permanent over the field. This extends the recent result of Arvind and
Srinivasan, who proved a similar result which however required the entries to
be of linear dimension.
  * [Easiness] Determinant of an n \times n matrix whose entries are themselves
d \times d upper triangular matrices can be computed in poly(n^d) time.
  Combining the above with the decomposition theorem of finite dimensional
algebras (in particular exploiting the simple structure of 2 \times 2 matrix
algebras), we can extend the above hardness and easiness statements to more
general algebras as follows. Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a
finite field with radical R(A).
  * [Hardness] If the quotient A/R(A) is non-commutative, then computing the
determinant over the algebra A is as hard as computing the permanent.
  * [Easiness] If the quotient A/R(A) is commutative and furthermore, R(A) has
nilpotency index d (i.e., the smallest d such that R(A)d = 0), then there
exists a poly(n^d)-time algorithm that computes determinants over the algebra
A.
  In particular, for any constant dimensional algebra A over a finite field,
since the nilpotency index of R(A) is at most a constant, we have the following
dichotomy theorem: if A/R(A) is commutative, then efficient determinant
computation is feasible and otherwise determinant is as hard as permanent.

A sequence over $F$ of length $m$ is a \emph{$k$-radius sequence} if any two

to show that these notions can be naturally derived from pairings of functors

explosion is not well explored. It depends on the possibility to amplify the
pre-collapse fields. Without rotation this can happen by compression,
convection, the standing accretion shock instability, and the accumulation and
growth of Alfven waves in the accretion flows.
  Aims. We investigate such amplification mechanisms of the magnetic field
during the collapse and post-bounce evolution of the core of a non-rotating 15
solar mass star with varied initial field strengths, taking into account the
microphysical equation of state and neutrino physics crucial for supernova
cores.
  Methods. We perform simulations of ideal MHD with neutrino transport in
axisymmetry. The transport of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos is treated
with a new scheme that solves the energy-dependent set of radiation energy and
momentum equations in 2d by using an analytic closure relation.
  Results. The magnetic field undergoes amplification by turbulent flows. We
find indications for amplification by interacting waves in accretion streams.
The fields can reach up to equipartition with the velocity field. Very high
magnetic field strengths require very strong pre-collapse fields and are able
to shape the post-bounce flow, leading to a pattern dominated by low-order
multipoles. Such models are closest to a successful explosion.
  Conclusions. Magnetic fields can build up to interesting strengths even in
non-rotating collapsing stellar cores. Starting with fields in the pre-collapse
core as predicted by present stellar evolution models, typical neutron star
fields emerge, whereas stronger progenitor fields lead to fields of magnetar
strength. Only in the latter case the fields have dynamical effects on the
flows in the supernova core. However, in none of our 2D simulations, we find an
explosion until 500 ms post-bounce.

of spiral galaxies to migrate radially across significant distances in the

move the guiding centers of the stars while preserving the circularities of
their orbits. Migration can therefore efficiently mix stars in all parts of the
Galactic disk. We are rapidly approaching an important confluence of theory and
observation, where we may soon be able to uncover signatures of such processes
in our own Milky Way. The resolution and robustness of the physical modeling in
simulations has improved drastically, while observational datasets are
increasing in depth and astrometric accuracy. Here, we discuss the results from
our idealized N-body/SPH simulations of disk formation and evolution,
emphasizing specifically the observational consequences of stellar migration on
the solar neighborhood and the vertical structure of the disk. We demonstrate
that radial mixing of stars is a crucial dynamical process that we must try to
understand if we are to draw significant conclusions about our Galactic history

respect to the right lower leg as its ankle moves. The random effects are the
five angles characterizing the orientation of the two rotation axes of a
subject's right ankle. The fixed parameters are the average value of these

nonlinear mixed effects models presented in Pinheiro and Bates (2000) are
adapted to the new directional model. The estimation of the random effects are
of interest since they give predictions of the rotation axes of an individual
ankle. The performance of these algorithms is investigated in a Monte Carlo
study. The analysis of two data sets is presented. In the biomechanical
literature, there is no consensus on an in vivo method to estimate the two
rotation axes of the ankle. The new model is promising. The estimates obtained
from a sample of volunteers are shown to be in agreement with the clinically
accepted results of Inman (1976), obtained by manipulating cadavers. The

general agreement between their models and seismic and non-seismic constraints,
there are serious problems pertaining to their interior. The good agreement
between the sound speed and base radius of the convective zone of the Sun and
the solar models is broken apart by a recent revision in solar chemical
composition. For $\alpha$ Cen A and B, however, it is not possible to fit
models with the same age and chemical composition to all seismic and
non-seismic observational constraints. At the age deduced from seismic
constraints, the luminosity ratio ($L_{\rm A}/L_{\rm B}$) of the models is
significantly lower than the ratio taken from the observed luminosities.
Enhancement of opacity as a function of temperature is one way to restore the
agreement between solar models and the Sun, but such an enhancement does not
alter the situation for $\alpha$ Cen A and B. The reason is that models of both
components are influenced in a similar manner and consequently the luminosity
ratio doesn't change much. In the present study, problems pertaining to the
interior of these three stars with a single expression for opacity enhancement
are modelled. The opacity enhancement is expressed as a function of density,
ionization degree of heavy elements (oxygen), and temperature. According to
this expression, for improvement of the models the required opacity enhancement
for $\alpha$ Cen A and B at $\log(T)$= 6.5, for example, is about 7 and 22 per
cent, respectively. The enhancement tak es place in the region in which
pressure ionization is effective, and is higher for low-mass stars than for
high-mass stars. This result seems to be a possible explanation for the serious
differences between models and observational results of cool stars.

the possibility to produce high-energy twisted photons by backward Compton
scattering of twisted laser photons on ultra-relativistic electrons with a
Lorentz-factor gamma=E/(m_e c^2) >> 1. When a twisted laser photon with the

of scattering processes is particularly simple for plane waves with definite

sampling strategy and applied to three flow problems with different difficulty
levels: (a) general flow problems of simple fluids, (b) parallel
(one-dimensional) flow problems of polymeric liquids, and (c) general (two- or
three-dimensional) flow problems of polymeric liquids. In our multiscale
methods, the local stress of each fluid element is calculated directly by
performing microscopic or mesoscopic simulations according to the local flow
quantities instead of using any constitutive relations. For simple fluids (a),
such as the Lenard-Jones liquid, a multiscale method combining MD and CFD
simulations is developed based on the local equilibrium assumption without
memories of the flow history. (b), the multiscale method is extended to take
into account the memory effects that arise in hydrodynamic stress due to the
slow relaxation of polymer-chain conformations. The memory of polymer dynamics
on each fluid element is thus resolved by performing MD simulations in which
cells are fixed at the mesh nodes of the CFD simulations.For general (two- or
three-dimensional) flow problems of polymeric liquids (c), it is necessary to
trace the history of microscopic information such as polymer-chain
conformation, which carries the memories of past flow history, along the
streamline of each fluid element. A Lagrangian-based CFD is thus implemented to
correctly advect the polymer-chain conformation consistently with the flow. On
each fluid element, coarse-grained polymer simulations are carried out to
consider the dynamics of entangled polymer chains that show extremely slow
relaxation compared to microscopic time scales.

to be universal. However, recently many sources have been found to produce jets
that, given certain accretion-powered luminosities, are fainter than expected
from the earlier correlations. This shows that black holes with similar
accretion flows can produce a broad range of outflows in power, suggesting that
some other parameters might be tuning the accretion/ejection coupling. Recent
work has already shown that this jet power does not correlate with the reported
black hole spin measurements. Here we discuss whether fixed parameters of the

the energy output in the jet. No obvious dependence is found. We also show that
there is no systematic variation of the slope of the radio:X-ray correlation

becomes larger than ~1 above ~0.1% of the Eddington luminosity. With this
model, if we assume random inclination angles which result in highly variable
boosting at large Eddington ratios, we are able to reproduce qualitatively the
scatter of the X-ray/radio correlation and the radio quiet population. However
the model seems to be at odds with some other observed properties of the

show that if a mass correction from the fundamental plane is applied, the
possibility that they are statistically indistinguishable in the X-ray:radio

approximation, we present several arguments showing that elementary topological
point defects in the order parameter bind a fractional charge. Our analysis
makes use of two appealing properties of the model: (i) For weak interaction,
the low-energy degrees of freedom are described by Dirac fermions coupled to a
complex-valued mass field (order parameter). (ii) The nearest-neighbor
interaction is geometrically frustrated at filling f=1/3. Both properties offer
a route to fractionalization and yield a consistent value 1/2 for the
fractional charge as long as the symmetry between the up and the down triangles
of the kagome lattice is preserved. If this symmetry is violated, the value of
the bound charge varies continuously with the strength of the symmetry-breaking
term in the model. In addition, we have numerically computed the confining
potential between two fractionally charged defects. We find that it grows
linearly at large distances but can show a minimum at a finite separation for
intermediate interactions. This indicates that the polaron state, formed upon

than the stellar period with a typical longitudinal width of 490 Mm and a
latitudinal extension increasing with the radial density contrast overpassing
50\degree of latitude for the thickest convective zone. Their rotation rate is
much larger than the local differential rotation rate increasing also with the
radial density contrast. However, their spatial coherence as a function of
depth decrease with the density contrast due to the stronger shear present in
these more stratified cases.

  Motion-Tracking Set of Jitter/Max/MSP Patches","13 pages; a December 2005 report; video is not included into the
  arXiv submission; Jitter language patches are not replicated in this version",,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This document supplements an experimental Jitter / Max/MSP collection of
implementation patches that set its goal to simulate an alchemical process for
a person standing in front of a mirror-like screen while interacting with it.
The work involved takes some patience and has three stages to go through. At
the final stage the ""alchemist"" in the mirror wearing sharp-colored gloves (for
motion tracking) is to extract the final ultimate shining sparkle (FFT-based
visualization) in the nexus of the hands. The more the hands are apart, the
large the sparkle should be. Moving hands around should make the sparkle
follow. To achieve the desired visual effect and the feedback mechanism, the
Jitter lattice-based intensional programming model is used to work on
4-dimensional (A+R+G+B) video matrices and sound signals in order to apply some
well-known alchemical techniques to the video at real-time to get a mirror
effect and accompanying transmutation and transformation stages of the video
based on the stability of the sound produced for some duration of time in
real-time. There is an accompanying video of the result with the interaction
with the tool and the corresponding programming patches.
