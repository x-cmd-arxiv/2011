stochastic variability, all contributing to the experimentally observed
heterogeneity in response to external death-inducing stimuli. Studies of
sources and regulation of variability in commitment to apoptotic cancer cell
death are likely to identify the fundamental features of apoptotic protein
networks that are responsible for determining the ultimate cell fate. Systems
biology approaches, involving computer simulations of the biochemical reactions
accompanied, if possible, by experimental verification of selected components

current understanding of the origins of stochastic variability in cells'
commitment to apoptosis, and its implications in the field on cancer therapy.

Thirty-one of the binaries, contain a white dwarf component. In such binaries
the total age can be estimated by adding the cooling age of the white dwarf to
an estimate of the progenitor's main sequence lifetime. To better understand
how CA correlates to stellar age, 14 cluster member stars were also observed.
Our observations demonstrate for the first time that in general CA decays with
age from 50 Myr to at least 8 Gyr for stars with 1.0 < V-I < 2.4. However,
little change occurs in CA level for stars with V-I < 1.0 between 1 Gyr and 5
Gyr, consistent with the results of Pace et al. (2009). Our sample also
exhibits a negative correlation between stellar age and metallicity, a positive
correlation between stellar age and W space velocity component and the W
velocity dispersion increases with age. Finally, the population membership of
these wide binaries is examined based upon their U, V, W kinematics,
metallicity and CA. We conclude that wide binaries are similar to field and
cluster stars in these respects. More importantly, they span a much more
continuous range in age and metallicity than is afforded by nearby clusters.

late-type stars are characterized by cooler upper photospheric layers than
their 1D counterparts. This property of 3D models can dramatically affect
elemental abundances derived from temperature-sensitive spectral lines. We
investigate whether the cool surface temperatures predicted by metal-poor 3D
models can be ascribed to the approximated treatment of scattering in the
radiative transfer. We use the Bifrost code to test three different ways to
handle scattering in 3D model atmospheres of metal-poor stars. First, we solve
self-consistently the radiative transfer equation for a source function with a
coherent scattering term. Second, we solve the radiative transfer equation for
a Planckian source function, neglecting the contribution of continuum
scattering to extinction in the optically thin layers; this has been the
default mode in previous models of ours. Third, we treat scattering as pure
absorption everywhere, which is the standard case in CO5BOLD models. We find
that the second approach produces temperature structures with cool upper
photospheric layers very similar to the correct coherent scattering solution.
In contrast, treating scattering as pure absorption leads to significantly
hotter and shallower temperature stratifications. The main differences in
temperature structure between our published models and those generated with the
CO5BOLD code can be traced to the different treatments of scattering.
Neglecting the contribution of continuum scattering to extinction in optically
thin layers provides a good approximation to the full radiative transfer
solution for metal-poor stars. Our results demonstrate that the cool
temperature stratifications predicted for metal-poor late-type stellar
atmospheres by previous models of ours are not an artifact of the approximated
treatment of scattering.

us to define a robust sample of candidate main sequence stars suitable for a

the well-established Hyades main sequence. Our results confirm previous
findings that NGC~3532 lies fairly near to the Sun [$(m-M)_0=8.46\pm0.05$;
$492^{+12}_{-11}$~pc] and has an extremely low reddening for its location near
the Galactic plane [$E(B-V)=0.028\pm0.006$]. Moreover, an age of $\sim300$\,Myr
has been derived for the cluster by fitting a set of overshooting isochrones to
the well-populated upper main-sequence. This new photometry also extends faint
enough to reach the cluster white dwarf sequence, as confirmed by our
photometric recovery of eight spectroscopically identified members of the
cluster. Using the location of these eight members, along with the latest
theoretical cooling tracks, we have identified $\sim30$ additional white dwarf
stars in the $[V,~(B-V)]$ color-magnitude diagram that have a high probability
of belonging to NGC~3532. The age we derive from fitting white dwarf isochrones
to the locus of these stars, $300\pm100$\,Myr, is consistent with the age
derived from the turnoff. Our analysis of the photometry also includes an

studying the HI content of these galaxies using both single-dish telescopes and
interferometers. Our goals are to determine if single-dish HI observations
represent a true measure of the dynamical mass of LCBGs and to look for
signatures of recent interactions that may be triggering star formation in
LCBGs. Our data show that while some LCBGs are undergoing interactions, many
appear isolated. While all LCBGs contain HI and show signatures of rotation,
the population does not lie on the Tully-Fisher relation nor can it evolve onto
it. Furthermore, the HI maps of many LCBGs show signatures of dynamically hot
components, suggesting that we are seeing the formation of a thick disk or
spheroid in at least some LCBGs. There is good agreement between the HI and
H-alpha kinematics for LCBGs, and both are similar in appearance to the H-alpha
kinematics of high redshift star-forming galaxies. Our combined data suggest
that star formation in LCBGs is primarily quenched by virial heating,

latter ones contain both the velocity vector u of a moving medium and the

this approach the Amp\`{e}r-Maxwell law and Gauss's law are inseparably
connected in one law and the same happens with Faraday's law and the law that

dispersion and has high [alpha/Fe] ratios at all metallicities. Stars formed
later end up in a thin, rotationally supported disc which has lower [alpha/Fe]
ratios. While the structural and kinematical properties of the merger remnants
depend strongly upon the orbital parameters of the mergers, we find a clear
chemical signature of gas-rich mergers.

theories is a challenging and active endeavor. Several sophisticated algorithms
have been employed to this end. While Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
nested sampling techniques are geared towards Bayesian inference, they have
also been used to estimate frequentist confidence intervals based on the
profile likelihood ratio. We investigate the performance and appropriate
configuration of MultiNest, a nested sampling based algorithm, when used for
profile likelihood-based analyses both on toy models and on the parameter space
of the Constrained MSSM. We find that while the standard configuration is
appropriate for an accurate reconstruction of the Bayesian posterior, the
profile likelihood is poorly approximated. We identify a more appropriate
MultiNest configuration for profile likelihood analyses, which gives an
excellent exploration of the profile likelihood (albeit at a larger
computational cost), including the identification of the global maximum
likelihood value. We conclude that with the appropriate configuration MultiNest
is a suitable tool for profile likelihood studies, indicating previous claims
to the contrary are not well founded.

minimum subset G of P's vertices such that every point in P is seen by at least
one point in G. This problem is NP-complete and APX-hard. The first
approximation algorithm (Ghosh, 1987) involves decomposing P into O(n^4) cells
that are equivalence classes for visibility from the vertices of P. This
discretized problem can then be treated as an instance of set cover and solved
in O(n^5) time with a greedy O(log n)-approximation algorithm. Ghosh (2010)
recently revisited the algorithm, noting that minimum visibility decompositions
for simple polygons (Bose et al., 2000) have only O(n^3) cells, improving the
running time of the algorithm to O(n^4) for simple polygons.
  In this paper we show that, since minimum visibility decompositions for
simple polygons have only O(n^2) cells of minimal visibility (Bose et al.,
2000), the running time of the algorithm can be further improved to O(n^3).
This result was obtained independently by Jang and Kwon (2011). We extend the
result of Bose et al. to polygons with holes, showing that a minimum visibility
decomposition of a polygon with h holes has only O((h+1)n^3) cells and only
O((h+1)^2 n^2) cells of minimal visibility. We exploit this result to obtain a
faster algorithm for vertex guarding polygons with holes. We then show that, in
the same time complexity, we can attain approximation factors of O(log
log(opt)) for simple polygons and O((1+\log((h+1))) log(opt)) for polygons with
holes.

associated with this wave is >/- 300 microW/m^2, roughly four orders of
magnitude above previous estimates. Such large Poynting flux values are
consistent with rapid energization of electrons. The majority of the largest
amplitude whistlers occur during magnetically active periods (AE > 200 nT). The
waves were observed to exhibit a broad range of propagation angles with respect
to the magnetic field, 0{\deg} </- {\theta}_kB < 90{\deg}, which showed no
consistent variation with magnetic latitude. These results are inconsistent
with the idea that the whistlers are all generated at the equator, propagating
along the magnetic field, and that the observed obliqueness is due to
propagation effects. We also identified three types of electron distributions
observed simultaneously with the whistler waves including beam-like,
beam/flattop, and anisotropic distributions. The whistlers exhibited different
characteristics depending on the observed electron distributions. The majority

measurements can be verified (or contradicted) by future Doppler observations.
This test is made possible by a confluence of two relatively unusual
circumstances. First, the binary lens is bright enough (I=15.6) to permit
Doppler measurements. Second, we measure not only the usual 7 binary-lens
parameters, but also the 'microlens parallax' (which yields the binary mass)
and two components of the instantaneous orbital velocity. Thus we measure,
effectively, 6 'Kepler+1' parameters (two instantaneous positions, two
instantaneous velocities, the binary total mass, and the mass ratio). Since
Doppler observations of the brighter binary component determine 5 Kepler
parameters (period, velocity amplitude, eccentricity, phase, and position of
periapsis), while the same spectroscopy yields the mass of the primary, the
combined Doppler + microlensing observations would be overconstrained by 6 + (5
+ 1) - (7 + 1) = 4 degrees of freedom. This makes possible an extremely strong
test of the microlensing solution. We also introduce a uniform microlensing
notation for single and binary lenses, we define conventions, summarize all
known microlensing degeneracies and extend a set of parameters to describe full
Keplerian motion of the binary lenses.

first massive M>10^14 Msun dark matter halos, the early thermal history of the
hot ICM, and the emergence of the red-sequence population of quenched
early-type galaxies. We present first results for the newly discovered X-ray
luminous galaxy cluster XMMU J1007.4+1237 at z=1.555, detected and confirmed by
the XMM-Newton Distant Cluster Project (XDCP) survey. We selected the system as
a serendipitous weak extended X-ray source in XMM-Newton archival data and
followed it up with two-band near-infrared imaging and deep optical
spectroscopy. We can establish XMMU J1007.4+1237 as a spectroscopically
confirmed, massive, bona fide galaxy cluster with a bolometric X-ray luminosity
of Lx=(2.1+-0.4)\times 10^44 erg/s, a red galaxy population centered on the
X-ray emission, and a central radio-loud brightest cluster galaxy. However, we
see evidence for the first time that the massive end of the galaxy population
and the cluster red-sequence are not yet fully in place. In particular, we find
ongoing starburst activity for the third ranked galaxy close to the center and
another slightly fainter object. At a lookback time of 9.4Gyr, the cluster
galaxy population appears to be caught in an important evolutionary phase,
prior to full star-formation quenching and mass assembly in the core region.
X-ray selection techniques are an efficient means of identifying and probing
the most distant clusters without any prior assumptions about their galaxy
content.

inhomogeneous. Existing constraints at z~6 on the volume-averaged neutral
hydrogen fraction, <x_HI>, are highly model-dependent and controversial.
Constraints at z<6, suggesting that the Universe is highly ionized, are also
model-dependent, but more fundamentally are invalid in the context of
inhomogeneous reionization. As such, it has recently been pointed out that
there is no conclusive evidence that reionization has completed by z~5--6, a
fact that has important ramifications on the interpretation of high-redshift
observations and theoretical models. We present the first direct upper limits
on <x_HI> at z~5--6 using the simple and robust statistic of the covering
fraction of dark pixels in the Ly alpha/beta forests of high redshift quasars.
With a sample of 13 Keck ESI spectra we constrain <x_HI> < 0.2 at 5 < z < 5.5,
rising to <x_HI> < 0.8 at z~6.1. We also find tentative evidence for a break in
the redshift evolution of the dark covering fraction at z~5.5. A subsample of
two deep spectra provides a more stringent constraint of <x_HI>(z=6.1) < 0.5
when combined with conservative estimates of cosmic variance. This upper limit
is comparable to existing results at z~6 but is more robust. The results
presented here do not rely on assumptions about the quasar continuum, IGM
density, HII morphology or ionizing background fields, and thus are a good
starting point for future interpretation of high redshift observations.

the abundance profiles as a linear function of log radius, we find steep
abundance gradients in cool core (CC) systems, with a slope of -0.54+/-0.07. In
contrast, non cool core (NCC) groups have profiles consistent with uniform
metallicity. Many CC groups show a central abundance dip or plateau, and we
find evidence for anticorrelation between the core abundance gradient and the
1.4 GHz radio power of the brightest group galaxy (BGG) in CC systems. This may
indicate the effect of AGN-driven mixing within the central ~0.1r_500. It is
not possible to discern whether such behaviour is present in the NCC groups,
due to the small and diverse sample with the requisite radio data. The lack of
strong abundance gradients in NCC groups, coupled with their lack of cool core,
and evidence for enhanced substructure, leads us to favour merging as the
mechanism for disrupting cool cores, although we cannot rule out disruption by
a major AGN outburst. Given the implied timescales, the disruptive event must
have occurred within the past few Gyrs in most NCC groups.

clusters within dark matter haloes of a range of masses (as well as in the
absence of a dark matter halo). In order to obtain a remnant which resembles
the observed extended star cluster, we find that the star formation efficiency
has to be quite high (around 33 per cent) and the dark matter halo, if present
at all, has to be of very low mass, i.e. raising the mass to light ratio of the
object within the body of the stellar distribution by at most a factor of a
few. We also find that expansion of a single star cluster following mass loss
provides another viable formation path. Finally, we show that future

transfer simulations are based on a suite of cosmological galaxy formation
simulations that reproduce a wide range of observed properties of damped Lya
absorption systems. The Lya emission is predicted to be spatially extended up
to several arcsec, and the spectral width of the Lya emission is broadened to
several hundred (in some case more than thousand) km/s. The distribution and
the dynamical state of the gas in the simulated galaxies is complex, the latter
with significant contributions from rotation and both in- and out-flows. The
emerging Lya radiation extends to gas with column densities of N_HI ~ 10^{18}
cm^{-2} and its spectral shape varies strongly with viewing angle. The strong
dependence on the central \hi column density and the HI velocity field suggests
that the Lya emission will also vary strongly with time on timescales of a few
dynamical times of the central region. Such variations with time should be
especially pronounced at times where the host galaxy undergoes a major merger
and/or starburst. Depending on the pre-dominance of in- or out-flow along a
given sightline and the central column density, the spectra show prominent blue
peaks, red peaks or double-peaked profiles. Both spatial distribution and
spectral shape are very sensitive to details of the galactic wind
implementation. Stronger galactic winds result in more spatially extended Lya
emission and - somewhat counterintuitively - a narrower spectral distribution.

dynamical attractor, the curvature fluctuations are scale-invariant and weakly
coupled for at least 10 e-folds only if the background is close to de Sitter

guarantees time-independent n-point functions. For non-attractor solutions, any

recently, Ly-alpha emitters were understood to be small star-forming galaxies,
possible building-blocks of larger galaxies. But with increased number of
observations of Ly-alpha emitters at lower redshifts, a new picture emerges.
Ly-alpha emitters display strong evolution in their properties from higher to
lower redshift. It has previously been shown that the fraction of
ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) among the Ly-alpha emitters increases
dramatically between redshift three and two. Here, the fraction of AGN among
the LAEs is shown to follow a similar evolutionary path. We argue that Ly-alpha
emitters are not a homogeneous class of objects, and that the objects selected

at that redshift. Ly-alpha emitters should hence be excellent tracers of galaxy
evolution in future simulations and modeling.

explore a range of parameter space in geometric sequences that mimic the
evolution of an embedded super star cluster. The inclusion of a hierarchically
clumped medium can make the envelope porous, in accordance with previous models
and supporting observational evidence. The infrared luminosity inferred from
observations can differ by a factor of two from the true value in the clumpiest
envelopes depending on the viewing angle. The infrared spectral energy
distribution also varies with viewing angle for clumpy envelopes, creating a
range in possible observable infrared colors and magnitudes, silicate feature
depths and dust continua. General observable features of cluster evolution
differ between envelopes that are relatively opaque or transparent to
mid-infrared photons. The [70]-[160] color can be used to determine star
formation efficiency; the Spitzer IRAC/MIPS [8.0]-[24] color is able to
constrain Rin and Rout values; and the IRAC [3.6]-[5.8] color is sensitive to
the fraction of the dust distributed in clumps. Finally, in a comparison of

Our sample was selected from a total of 253 GBM GRBs based on each event peak
count rate measured between 0.2 and 40MeV. The final sample comprised 34 long
and 18 short GRBs. These numbers show that the GBM sample contains a much
larger fraction of short GRBs, than the CGRO/BATSE data set, which we explain
as the result of our (different) selection criteria and the improved GBM
trigger algorithms, which favor collection of short, bright GRBs over BATSE. A
first by-product of our selection methodology is the determination of a
detection threshold from the GBM data alone, above which GRBs most likely will
be detected in the MeV/GeV range with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard
Fermi. This predictor will be very useful for future multiwavelength GRB follow
ups with ground and space based observatories. Further we have estimated the
burst durations up to 10MeV and for the first time expanded the duration-energy
relationship in the GRB light curves to high energies. We confirm that GRB
durations decline with energy as a power law with index approximately -0.4, as
was found earlier with the BATSE data and we also notice evidence of a possible
cutoff or break at higher energies. Finally, we performed time-integrated
spectral analysis of all 52 bursts and compared their spectral parameters with
those obtained with the larger data sample of the BATSE data. We find that the
two parameter data sets are similar and confirm that short GRBs are in general

numerical data from a recently developed code that outputs the Lorenz-gauge
gravitational self-force (GSF) acting on the particle along the eccentric
geodesic. First, we calculate the $O(\mu/M)$ conservative correction to the
periastron advance of the orbit, as a function of the (gauge-dependent)
semilatus rectum and eccentricity. A gauge-invariant description of the GSF
precession effect is made possible in the circular-orbit limit, where we
express the correction to the periastron advance as a function of the invariant
azimuthal frequency. We compare this relation with results from fully nonlinear
numerical-relativistic simulations. In order to obtain a gauge-invariant
measure of the GSF effect for fully eccentric orbits, we introduce a suitable
generalization of Detweiler's circular-orbit ""redshift"" invariant. We compute
the $O(\mu/M)$ conservative correction to this invariant, expressed as a
function of the two invariant frequencies that parametrize the orbit. Our
results are in good agreement with results from post-Newtonian calculations in
the weak-field regime, as we shall report elsewhere. The results of our study
can inform the development of analytical models for the dynamics of strongly

to investigate how gas accretion takes place and evolves in close T Tauri

Tauri binaries, V4046 Sgr and DQ Tau, both showing periodic changes in emission
lines, although their orbital characteristics are very different. In order to
derive the density and velocity maps of the circumbinary material, we employ
two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with a locally isothermal equation of
state. The flow patterns become quasi-stable after a few orbits in the frame
co-rotating with the system. Gas flows across the circumbinary gap through the
co-rotating Lagrangian points, and local circumstellar discs develop around
both components. Spiral density patterns develop in the circumbinary disc that
transport angular momentum efficiently. Mass is preferentially channelled
towards the primary and its circumstellar disc is more massive than the disc
around the secondary. We also compare the derived density distribution to
observed line profile variability. The line profile variability tracing the gas
flows in the central cavity shows clear similarities with the corresponding
observed line profile variability in V4046 Sgr, but only when the local
circumstellar disc emission was excluded. Closer to the stars normal
magnetospheric accretion may dominate while further out the dynamic accretion

Seyfert 1 galaxies can be reproduced by a combination of dust heated by the
central engine and direct AGN emission, while for the Seyfert 2 nuclei only
dust emission is considered. These dusty tori have physical sizes smaller than
6 pc radius, as derived from our fits. Unification schemes of AGN account for a
variety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. However, we
find evidence that strong unification may not hold, and that the immediate
dusty surroundings of Type-1 and Type-2 Seyfert nuclei are intrinsically
different. The Type-2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, and
these clumps have lower optical depths than those of Type-1 tori. The larger
the covering factor of the torus, the smaller the probability of having direct
view of the AGN, and vice-versa. In our sample, Seyfert 2 tori have larger
covering factors and smaller escape probabilities than those of Seyfert 1. All
the previous differences are significant according to the Kullback-Leibler
divergence. Thus, on the basis of the results presented here, the
classification of a Seyfert galaxy as a Type-1 or Type-2 depends more on the
intrinsic properties of the torus rather than on its mere inclination towards
us, in contradiction with the simplest unification model.

scattering surface can be calculated using the distance-redshift relation as in
the Friedmann model. However, in the inhomogeneous universe, even if
<\delta\rho> =0, the distance relation is not the same as in the unperturbed
universe. This can be of serious consequences as a change of distance affects
the mapping of CMB temperature fluctuations into the angular power spectrum. In
addition, if the change of distance is relatively uniform no new temperature
fluctuations are generated. It is therefore a different effect than the lensing
or ISW effects which introduce additional CMB anisotropies. This paper shows
that the accuracy of the CMB analysis can be impaired by the accuracy of
calculation of the distance within the cosmological models. Since this effect
has not been fully explored before, to test how the inhomogeneities affect the
distance-redshift relation, several methods are examined: the Dyer-Roeder
relation, lensing approximation, and non-linear Swiss-Cheese model. In all
cases, the distance to the last scattering surface is different than when
homogeneity is assumed. The difference can be as low as 1% and as high as 80%.
Excluding extreme cases, the distance changes by about 20-30%. Since the
distance to the last scattering surface is set by the position of the CMB
peaks, in order to have a good fit, the distance needs to be adjusted. After
correcting the distance, the cosmological parameters change. Therefore, a not
properly estimated distance to the last scattering surface can be a major
source of systematics. This paper shows that if inhomogeneities are taken into
account when calculating the distance then models with positive spatial
curvature and with \Omega_\Lambda ~ 0.8-0.9 are preferred. The \Lambda CDM
model in most cases, is at odds with the current data.

phenotype, and can reveal functional compensation and buffering between
pathways under genetic perturbations. Recently, genome-wide screening for
genetic interactions has revealed genetic interaction networks that provide
novel insights either when analyzed by themselves or when integrated with other
functional genomic datasets. For higher eukaryotes such as human, the above
reverse-genetics approaches are not straightforward since the phenotypes of
interest for higher eukaryotes are difficult to study in a cell based assay. We
propose a general framework for constructing and analyzing human genetic
interaction networks from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
used for case-control studies on complex diseases. Specifically, the approach
contains three major steps: (1) estimating SNP-SNP genetic interactions, (2)
identifying linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and mapping SNP-SNP interactions
to block-block interactions, and (3) functional mapping for LD blocks. We
performed two sets of functional analyses for each of the six datasets used in
the paper, and demonstrated that (i) the constructed genetic interaction
networks are supported by functional evidence from independent biological
databases, and (ii) the network can be used to discover pairs of compensatory
gene modules (between-pathway models) in their joint association with a disease
phenotype. The proposed framework should provide novel insights beyond existing
approaches that either ignore interactions between SNPs or model different
SNP-SNP pairs with genetic interactions separately. Furthermore, our study
provides evidence that some of the core properties of genetic interaction
networks based on reverse genetics in model organisms like yeast are also
present in genetic interactions revealed by natural variation in human
populations.

complexity of sparse data acquisition. One of the major obstacles for practical
deployment of CS techniques is the signal reconstruction time and the high
storage cost of random sensing matrices. We propose a new structured
compressive sensing scheme, based on codes of graphs, that allows for a joint
design of structured sensing matrices and logarithmic-complexity reconstruction
algorithms. The compressive sensing matrices can be shown to offer
asymptotically optimal performance when used in combination with Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) methods. For more elaborate greedy reconstruction
schemes, we propose a new family of list decoding belief propagation
algorithms, as well as reinforced- and multiple-basis belief propagation
algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that reinforced BP CS schemes offer
very good complexity-performance tradeoffs for very sparse signal vectors.

using NUV-R colors does not change the results. Using HST/ACS imaging, we study
several quantitative morphological parameters including CAS, B/T from GIM2D,

the red and blue galaxy populations in terms of concentration, asymmetry, and
morphological type and merger fraction estimated using Gini/M_20. We find that
most green galaxies are not classified as mergers; in fact, the merger fraction
in the green valley is lower than in the blue cloud. We show that at a given
stellar mass, green galaxies have higher concentration values than blue
galaxies and lower concentration values than red galaxies. Additionally, we
find that 12% of green galaxies have B/T = 0 and 21% with B/T \leq 0.05. Our

processes play an important role both in driving gas towards the center of

  and Retrieval",,,,,"cs.CV cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The past decade has seen the growing popularity of Bag of Features (BoF)
approaches to many computer vision tasks, including image classification, video
search, robot localization, and texture recognition. Part of the appeal is
simplicity. BoF methods are based on orderless collections of quantized local
image descriptors; they discard spatial information and are therefore
conceptually and computationally simpler than many alternative methods. Despite
this, or perhaps because of this, BoF-based systems have set new performance
standards on popular image classification benchmarks and have achieved
scalability breakthroughs in image retrieval. This paper presents an
introduction to BoF image representations, describes critical design choices,
and surveys the BoF literature. Emphasis is placed on recent techniques that
mitigate quantization errors, improve feature detection, and speed up image
retrieval. At the same time, unresolved issues and fundamental challenges are
raised. Among the unresolved issues are determining the best techniques for
sampling images, describing local image features, and evaluating system
performance. Among the more fundamental challenges are how and whether BoF
methods can contribute to localizing objects in complex images, or to
associating high-level semantics with natural images. This survey should be
useful both for introducing new investigators to the field and for providing
existing researchers with a consolidated reference to related work.

Way arising from electroweak bremsstrahlung contributions to the annihilation

significantly boost DM annihilation yields. Recently, we have shown that
electroweak bremsstrahlung of W and Z gauge bosons can be the dominant
annihilation channel in some popular models with helicity-suppressed 2 --> 2
annihilation. W/Z-bremsstrahlung is particularly interesting because the gauge
bosons produced via annihilation subsequently decay to produce large correlated
fluxes of electrons, positrons, neutrinos, hadrons (including antiprotons) and
gamma rays, which are all of importance in indirect dark matter searches. Here
we calculate the spectra of stable annihilation products produced via
gamma/W/Z-bremsstrahlung. After modifying the fluxes to account for the
propagation through the Galaxy, we set upper bounds on the annihilation cross
section via a comparison with observational data. We show that stringent cosmic
ray antiproton limits preclude a sizable dark matter contribution to observed
cosmic ray positron fluxes in the class of models for which the bremsstrahlung

We analyze a candidate state for this scenario where the local moment system
forms a spin liquid with gapless fermionic excitations. We discuss the thermal
conductivity and spin susceptibility of this fractionalized state both in two

We derive a variational functional for the thermal conductivity and solve it

transport is dominated by the spinon contribution which can be detected by a

galaxy contains a supersoft, ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) whose spectrum
consists of a thermal component with a temperature about 0.1 keV and a
power-law tail with a photon index around 2.5. The thermal emission is
absolutely the dominant component, contributing 96% of the total luminosity in
the 0.3-10 keV band. Variability is detected at timescales of 10^2 s and longer
with a \nu^-1 power spectrum. These properties are consistent with black hole
binaries in the thermal state and suggest the presence of an intermediate mass
black hole of at least 600 solar masses. However, the integrated rms power is
much higher than typically found in the thermal state. An alternative
explanation of the emission could be a photosphere with a radius about 10^9 cm.
A possible absorption feature around 1 keV is detected, which may be due to
absorption of highly ionized winds. X-ray sources within the disk of NGC 247
have a luminosity function consistent with that found in low mass X-ray
binaries. We confirm previous results that X-rays from the quasar PHL 6625 may
be absorbed by gas in NGC 247, mainly at energies below 0.3 keV.

down to {\it V} $\sim$ 20 mag in about 1 deg$^{2}$ field. A2589 has been also

cross-identification of the BATC-detected galaxies with the SDSS photometric
catalog achieves 1199 galaxies brighter than $i=19.5$ mag, among which 68
member galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts are found. After combining
the SDSS five-band photometric data and the BATC SEDs, the technique of
photometric redshift is applied to these galaxies for selecting faint member
galaxies. The color-magnitude relation is taken as a further restriction of
early-type cluster galaxies. As a result, 106 galaxies are newly selected as
member galaxies. Spatial distribution of member galaxies shows a north-south
elongation which agrees with the X-ray brightness profile and the orientation
of central cD galaxy, NGC 7647. No substructures are detected on the basis of
positions and radial velocities of cluster galaxies, indicating that A2589 is a
well-relaxed system. The luminosity function of A2589 exhibits a peak at $M_{R}

are the preferred habitat of faint galaxies. With the evolutionary population
synthesis model, PEGASE, the environmental effect on the star formation
properties for 68 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies is studied. The
outlier faint galaxies tend to have longer time scales of star formation,
shorter mean stellar ages, and lower metallicities of interstellar medium,
which can be interpreted in the context of hierarchical cosmological scenario.

IBMAP-HC and IBMAP-TS. Experimental results over both artificial and real world

IBMAP-HC proceeds efficiently, achieving these improvements in a time

clouds. 5) In our simulations, the SFE approaches stationarity, because mass is
added to the GMC at a similar rate at which it converts mass to stars. In such
an approximately stationary regime, the SFE provides a proxy of the
supercritical mass fraction in the cloud. 6) We observe the occurrence of
buoyancy of the low-M2FR regions within the gravitationally-contracting GMCs,
so that the latter naturally segregate into a high-density, high-M2FR ""core""
and a low-density, low-M2FR ""envelope"", without the intervention of AD.

a fluorescent XPC fusion at lesions induced by laser microirradiation in a

$\eta$ and $\eta'$ which has been under serious discussion for many years.
Measurements on different decay and/or production modes were employed in
literatures, thus larger uncertainties were unavoidable. In this paper we
suggest to determine the mixing angles of $\eta-\eta'-G$ using the data of
semileptonic decays of $D$ and $D_s$. We extract the mixing angles $\phi'$,
$\phi_G$ and the model parameters simultaneously. Thanks to the new
measurements carried out by CLEO Collaboration and there are sufficient decay
modes to determine both the model parameters and mixing angles. The mixing
angles from data are $\phi'=(41.5\pm2.0)^\circ$ and $\sin\phi_G=0.00\pm0.36$.
Even though the central value of $\sin\phi_G$ is still zero, an upper bound is
set. Moreover, as suggested in literature, $\eta(1405)$ is a glueball candidate
whereas in our picture, $\eta(1405)$ may be identified as $G$ with glueonium
being its main content. Using all the model-parameters obtained above, we

spectra requires that the abundances of the iron lines are not correlated with
the observed equivalent widths. An alternative method, requiring the use of the
expected line strength, is often used to by-pass the risk of spurious slopes
due to the correlation between the errors in abundance and equivalent width.
Aims --- To compare the two methods and identify pros and cons and
applicability to the typical practical cases. Methods --- I performed a test
with a grid of synthetic spectra, including instrumental broadening and
Poissonian noise. For all these spectra, microturbulent velocity has been
derived by using the two approaches and compared with the original value with
which the synthetic spectra have been generated. Results --- The two methods
provide similar results for spectra with SNR$ > 70, while for lower SNR both
approaches underestimate the true microturbulent velocity, depending of the SNR
and the possible selection of the lines based on the equivalent width errors.
Basically, the values inferred by using the observed equivalent widths better
agree with those of the synthetic spectra. In fact, the method based on the
expected line strength is not totally free from a bias that can heavily affect
the determination of microturbulent velocity. Finally, I recommend to use the
classical approach (based on the observed equivalent widths) to infer this
parameter. In cases of full spectroscopical determination of all the
atmospherical parameters, the difference between the two approaches is reduced,
leading to an absolute difference in the derived iron abundances of less than
0.1 dex.

and to determine the fundamental stellar parameters from ground-based
spectroscopy gathered with the CORALIE and HARPS instruments after checking for
signs of variability and binarity, thus making a step further in mapping the
top of the Beta Cep instability strip. We compare the newly obtained
high-resolution spectra with synthetic spectra of late O-type and early B-type
stars computed on a grid of stellar parameters. We match the results with
evolutionary tracks to estimate stellar parameters. We use various time series
analysis tools to explore the nature of the variations present in the light
curve. Additional calculations are carried out based on distance and historical
position measurements of the components to impose constraints on the binary
orbit. We find that HD 51756 is a wide binary with both a slow (v sin i \approx
28 km s^-1) and a fast (v sin i \approx 170 km s^-1) early-B rotator whose
atmospheric parameters are similar (T_eff \approx 30000 K and log g \approx
3.75). We are unable to detect pulsation in any of the components, and we
interpret the harmonic structure in the frequency spectrum as sign of
rotational modulation, which is compatible with the observed and deduced
stellar parameters of both components. The non-detection of pulsation modes
provides a feedback on the theoretical treatment, given that non-adiabatic
computations applied to appropriate stellar models predict the excitation of

dynamics and evolution of molecular clouds and the star formation which occurs
within them. Non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects are known to influence the
nature of this turbulence. We present the results of a suite of 512-cubed
resolution simulations of the decay of initially super-Alfvenic and supersonic
fully multifluid MHD turbulence. We find that ambipolar diffusion increases the
rate of decay of the turbulence while the Hall effect has virtually no impact.
The decay of the kinetic energy can be fitted as a power-law in time and the
exponent is found to be -1.34 for fully multifluid MHD turbulence. The power
spectra of density, velocity and magnetic field are all steepened significantly
by the inclusion of non-ideal terms. The dominant reason for this steepening is
ambipolar diffusion with the Hall effect again playing a minimal role except at
short length scales where it creates extra structure in the magnetic field.
Interestingly we find that, at least at these resolutions, the majority of the
physics of multifluid turbulence can be captured by simply introducing fixed
(in time and space) resistive terms into the induction equation without the
need for a full multifluid MHD treatment. The velocity dispersion is also
examined and, in common with previously published results, it is found not to
be power-law in nature.

Information Flow. Information theory, probability, guessability are the main
ideas in most proposals. They aim to quantify how much information is leaked,
how likely is to guess the secret and how long does it take to guess the secret

valuable foundation for all these approaches; not only it provides an elegant
algebraic framework for the ideas, but also to investigate their relationship.
In particular we will use this lattice to prove some results establishing order
relation correspondences between the different quantitative approaches. The
implications of these results w.r.t. recent work in the community is also
investigated. While this work concentrates on the foundational importance of
the Lattice of Information its practical relevance has been recently proven,
notably with the quantitative analysis of Linux kernel vulnerabilities. Overall
we believe these works set the case for establishing the Lattice of Information

short-period planets were engulfed by their host star evolving off the main
sequence. To do so, we have simulated the orbital evolution of planets,
including the effects of stellar tide and mass loss, to determine the critical
semimajor axis, a_crit, beyond which planets survive the RGB expansion of their
host star. We have found that a_crit changes drastically around 2 M_sun: In the
lower-mass range, a_crit is more than 1 AU, while a_crit is as small as about
0.2 AU in the higher-mass range. Comparison with measured semimajor axes of
known planets suggests that there is a lack of planets that only planet
engulfment never accounts for in the higher-mass range. Whether the lack is
real affects our understanding of planet formation. Therefore, increasing the
number of planet samples around evolved intermediate-mass stars is quite
meaningful to confirm robustness of the lack of planets.

we are operating in the Grassmann manifold, the usual approach which consists
of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the true subspace $U$ and its
estimate $\hat{U}$ may not be adequate as the MSE is not the natural metric in
the Grassmann manifold. As an alternative, we propose to carry out subspace
estimation by minimizing the mean square distance (MSD) between $U$ and its
estimate, where the considered distance is a natural metric in the Grassmann
manifold, viz. the distance between the projection matrices. We show that the
resulting estimator is no longer the posterior mean of $U$ but entails
computing the principal eigenvectors of the posterior mean of $U U^{T}$.
Derivation of the MMSD estimator is carried out in a few illustrative examples
including a linear Gaussian model for the data and a Bingham or von Mises
Fisher prior distribution for $U$. In all scenarios, posterior distributions
are derived and the MMSD estimator is obtained either analytically or
implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method. The method is
shown to provide accurate estimates even when the number of samples is lower
than the dimension of $U$. An application to hyperspectral imagery is finally
investigated.

collections of genes that show moderate but coordinated differences in
expression. However, such techniques may be ineffective if many individual
genes in a phenotype-related gene set have weak discriminative power. A
potential solution is to search for combinations of genes that are highly
differentiating even when individual genes are not. Although such techniques
have been developed, these approaches have not been used with GSEA to any
significant degree because of the large number of potential gene combinations
and the heterogeneity of measures that assess the differentiation provided by
gene groups of different sizes.
  To integrate the search for differentiating gene combinations and GSEA, we
propose a general framework with two key components: (A) a procedure that
reduces the number of scores to be handled by GSEA to the number of genes by
summarizing the scores of the gene combinations involving a particular gene in
a single score, and (B) a procedure to integrate the heterogeneous scores from
combinations of different sizes and from different gene combination measures by
mapping the scores to p-values. Experiments on four gene expression data sets
demonstrate that the integration of GSEA and gene combination search can
enhance the power of traditional GSEA by discovering gene sets that include
genes with weak individual differentiation but strong joint discriminative
power. Also, gene sets discovered by the integrative framework share several
common biological processes and improve the consistency of the results among
three lung cancer data sets.

concordance classes of classical links in terms of class and order
respectively. Using the tree-valued intersection theory of Whitney towers, the
associated graded quotients are shown to be finitely generated abelian groups
under a (surprisingly) well-defined connected sum operation. Twisted Whitney
towers are also introduced, along with a corresponding quadratic enhancement of
the intersection theory for framed Whitney towers that measures Whitney-disk
framing obstructions. The obstruction theory in the framed setting is
strengthened, and the relationships between the twisted and framed filtrations
are described in terms of exact sequences which show how higher-order
Sato-Levine and higher-order Arf invariants are obstructions to framing a
twisted Whitney tower. The results from this paper combine with those in
\cite{CST2,CST3,CST4} to give a classifications of the filtrations; see our
survey \cite{CST0} as well as the end of the introduction. UPDATE: This paper

in the CDF-S. The Chandra 4 Ms spectra of BzK4892 and BzK8608 show a reflection
dominated continuum with strong Iron lines, with rest-frame equivalent widths
EW-2.3 keV and 1.2 keV, respectively, demonstrating Compton thick obscuration
of the central AGN. For BzK8608 the line identification closely matches the
existing photometric redshift derived from the stellar emission. We use the
observed luminosities of the Iron K{\alpha} line, of the rest-frame mid-IR
continuum and of the UV rest-frame narrow emission lines to infer intrinsic
L(2-10 keV)>1e44 erg/s, about 1.0-2.5 dex larger than the observed ones, hence
confirming the presence of an absorber with N(H) > 1e24 cm-2. The two BzK
galaxies have stellar masses of 5e10 M\odot and, based on VLA 1.4 GHz and submm
870{\mu}m observations, they appear to host vigorous starburst activity with
SFR - 300-700 M\odot/yr that is also optically thick. We estimate that the AGN
might also conceivably account for an important fraction of the bolometric
far-IR emission of the galaxies. The implied volume density of Compton thick
(CT) AGN with L(2-10 keV)>1e44 erg/s is in agreement with predictions from
X-ray background synthesis models. These sources provide one of the first
clearcut observations of the long-sought phase of simultaneous, heavily
obscured quasar and star formation activity, predicted by models of massive
galaxy evolution at high redshifts.

J195509.6+261406 discovered as the afterglow of what was first believed to be a
long duration Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB 070610). The outburst of this source was
characterized by unique optical flares on timescales of second or less,
morphologically similar to the short X-ray bursts usually observed from
magnetars. Our Chandra observation was performed ~2 years after the discovery
of the optical and X-ray flaring activity of this source, catching it in its
quiescent state. We derive stringent upper limits on the quiescent emission of
Swif J195509.6+261406 which argues against the possibility of this object being
a typical magnetar. Our limits show that the most viable interpretation on the
nature of this peculiar bursting source, is a binary system hosting a black

with an orbital period smaller than a few hours.

a subset of $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimality conditions. We present several numerical
examples that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method showing that
it outperforms other existing techniques in both quality and numerical

method (device and procedure) to conduct this experiment was designed and
called LDR (Length Duration Relation) In the present study a pilot and three
series of the primary experiment were conducted under conditions of different
levels of uncertainty. In all types of experiments, signals of a certain
duration and modality were presented twice in random order to the subjects.
Subjects had to respond to time signals of different durations by choosing a
corresponding space interval. The data which were obtained during the 1st and
the 2nd time signal presentations were examined separately. The comparative
data analysis of the experiment showed significant differences between the 1st
and 2nd presentation of signals in the quantity of correct responses, the
responses distribution along the scale of stimuli, the phenomena which occurred
during the experiment. The higher level of uncertainty condition under which a
certain type of the experiment was conducted, the more clearly this difference
was manifested.
  Based on results of the experiments comparative data analysis, one can
suppose that the perceptive mechanism, named by us as an innate mechanism of
proportionality, performed the correlation of these intervals into two stages:

enhanced QoS for wireless com- munications. Since the benefits from MIMO result
in a heavy computational load in detectors, the design of low-complexity
sub-optimum receivers is currently an active area of research.
Lattice-reduction-aided detection (LRAD) has been shown to be an effective
low-complexity method with near-ML performance. In this paper we advocate the
use of systolic array architectures for MIMO receivers, and in particular we
exhibit one of them based on LRAD. The ""LLL lattice reduction algorithm"" and
the ensuing linear detections or successive spatial-interference cancellations
can be located in the same array, which is con- siderably hardware-efficient.
Since the conventional form of the LLL algorithm is not immediately suitable
for parallel processing, two modified LLL algorithms are considered here for
the systolic array. LLL algorithm with full-size reduction (FSR-LLL) is one of
the versions more suitable for parallel processing. Another variant is the
all-swap lattice-reduction (ASLR) algorithm for complex-valued lattices, which
processes all lattice basis vectors simultaneously within one iteration. Our
novel systolic array can operate both algorithms with different external logic
controls. In order to simplify the systolic array design, we replace the
Lov\'asz condition in the definition of LLL-reduced lattice with the looser
Siegel condition. Simulation results show that for LR- aided linear detections,
the bit-error-rate performance is still maintained with this relaxation.
Comparisons between the two algorithms in terms of bit-error-rate performance,
and average FPGA processing time in the systolic array are made, which shows
that ASLR is a better choice for a systolic architecture, especially for
systems with a large number of antennas.
