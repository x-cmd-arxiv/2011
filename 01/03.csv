state $\rho_0$ combined with an ancilla state $\sigma$ is encoded unitarily and
an error operator is applied on the encoded state. The recovery operation then
produces a tensor product state $\rho_0 \otimes \sigma'$. The decoding
operation is combined with the recovery operation and the state $\rho_0$ is
directly reproduced without referring to the code word. A higher rank
projection operator required for a conventional operator quantum error
correction is not necessary to implement. Encoding and the recovery operations
are implemented with unitary operators only, which makes quantum error
correction much easier than any other proposals.

shown that learning the gradient of the value-function at every point along a
trajectory generated by a greedy policy is a sufficient condition for the
trajectory to be locally extremal, and often locally optimal, and we argue that
this brings greater efficiency to value-function learning. This contrasts to
traditional value-function learning in which the value-function must be learnt
over the whole of state space.
  It is also proven that policy-gradient learning applied to a greedy policy on
a value-function produces a weight update equivalent to a value-gradient weight
update, which provides a surprising connection between these two alternative
paradigms of reinforcement learning, and a convergence proof for control
problems with a value function represented by a general smooth function

[Phys. Rev. E 81, 051130 (2010)] of using the second law applied to an isolated
system {\Sigma}_0 consisting of the homogeneous system {\Sigma} and the medium
{\Sigma}. We establish on general grounds the continuity of the Gibbs free
energy G(t) of {\Sigma} as a function of time at fixed temperature and pressure
of the medium. It immediately follows from this and the observed continuity of
the enthalpy during component confinement that the entropy S of the open system
{\Sigma} must remain continuous during a component confinement such as at a
glass transition. We use these continuity properties and the recently developed
non-equilibrium thermodynamics to formulate thermodynamic principles of
additivity, reproducibility, continuity and stability that must also apply to
non-equilibrium systems in internal equilibrium. We find that the
irreversibility during a glass transition only justifies the residual entropy
S_{R} to be at least as much as that determined by disregarding the
irreversibility, a common practice in the field. This justifies a non-zero
residual entropy S_{R} in glasses, which is also in accordance with the energy
or enthalpy gap at absolute zero. We develop a statistical formulation of the
entropy of a non-equilibrium system, which results in the continuity of entropy
during component confinement in accordance with the second law and sheds light
on the mystery behind the residual entropy, which is consistent with the recent
conclusion [Symmetry 2, 1201 (2010)] drawn by us.

but also the modification due to internal variables that play a dominant role

glass transition. A system possess several kinds of glass transitions, some
conventional (L \rightarrow gL; gL\rightarrow GL) in which the state change
continuously and the transition mimics a continuous or second order transition,

perceived as the yin and yang of quantum mechanics: particle simultaneously
propagating along several distinct classical paths versus particle penetrating

we demonstrate that the Dirac quasiparticles in graphene provide a dramatic
departure from this paradigm. We show that Zener tunneling in gapped bilayer
graphene (BLG), which governs transport through p-n heterojunctions, exhibits
common-path interference that takes place under the tunnel barrier. Due to a
symmetry peculiar to the BLG bandstructure, interfering tunneling paths form
`conjugate pairs', giving rise to high-contrast oscillations in transmission as
a function of the gate-tunable bandgap and other control parameters of the
junction. The common-path interference is solely due to forward-propagating
waves; in contrast to Fabry-Perot-type interference in resonant tunneling
structures it does not rely on multiple backscattering. The oscillations
manifest themselves in the junction I-V characteristic as N-shaped branches
with negative differential conductivity, enabling new high-speed active-circuit
devices with architectures which are not available in electronic semiconductor

thermodynamics [Phys. Rev. E 81, 051130 (2010), to be denoted by I in this
work] to inhomogeneous systems by considering the latter to be composed of
quasi-independent subsystems. The system {\Sigma} along with the
(macroscopically extremely large) medium {\Sigma} forms an isolated system
{\Sigma}_0. Starting from the Gibbsian formulation of the entropy for
{\Sigma}_0, which is valid even when {\Sigma}_0 is out of equilibrium, we
derive the Gibbsian formulation of the entropy of {\Sigma}, which need not be
in equilibrium. The additivity of entropy requires quasi-independence of the
subsystems, which limits the size of various subsystems. The thermodynamic
potentials of subsystems such as the Gibbs free energy are determined by the
field parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) of the medium even if the latter
may not exist for the subsystems. This and the requirement of
quasi-independence make our approach different from the conventional approach
due to de Groot and others. As the energy depends on the frame of reference,
the thermodynamic potentials and Gibbs fundamental relation, but not the
entropy, depend on the frame of reference. The possibility of relative motion
between subsystems described by their net linear and angular momenta gives rise
to viscous dissipation. Important consequences of internal equilibrium are
discussed. Internal variables as variables that cannot be controlled by the
observer for non-equilibrium evolution are also discussed. We finally formulate
the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of inhomogeneous systems. We also briefly
discuss the case when bodies form an isolated system without any medium to
obtain their irreversible contributions and show that this case is no different
than when bodies are in an extremely large medium.

design of an efficient Business Card Reader (BCR) is challenging to the
researchers. Extraction of text regions and segmenting them into characters is
one of such challenges. In this paper, we have presented an efficient character
segmentation technique for business card images captured by a cell-phone
camera, designed in our present work towards developing an efficient BCR. At
first, text regions are extracted from the card images and then the skewed ones
are corrected using a computationally efficient skew correction technique. At
last, these skew corrected text regions are segmented into lines and characters
based on horizontal and vertical histogram. Experiments show that the present
technique is efficient and applicable for mobile devices, and the mean
segmentation accuracy of 97.48% is achieved with 3 mega-pixel (500-600 dpi)
images. It takes only 1.1 seconds for segmentation including all the
preprocessing steps on a moderately powerful notebook (DualCore T2370, 1.73

intensity of interest over the past few years. Distributed solutions (e.g., the
primal-dual gradient method) have been intensively investigated under fading
channels. As such distributed solutions involve iterative updating and explicit
message passing, it is unrealistic to assume that the wireless channel remains
unchanged during the iterations. Unfortunately, the behavior of those
distributed solutions under time-varying channels is in general unknown. In
this paper, we shall investigate the convergence behavior and tracking errors
of the iterative primal-dual scaled gradient algorithm (PDSGA) with dynamic
scaling matrices (DSC) for solving distributive NUM problems under time-varying
fading channels. We shall also study a specific application example, namely the
multi-commodity flow control and multi-carrier power allocation problem in
multi-hop ad hoc networks. Our analysis shows that the PDSGA converges to a
limit region rather than a single point under the finite state Markov chain
(FSMC) fading channels. We also show that the order of growth of the tracking
errors is given by O(T/N), where T and N are the update interval and the
average sojourn time of the FSMC, respectively. Based on this analysis, we
derive a low complexity distributive adaptation algorithm for determining the
adaptive scaling matrices, which can be implemented distributively at each
transmitter. The numerical results show the superior performance of the
proposed dynamic scaling matrix algorithm over several baseline schemes, such
as the regular primal-dual gradient algorithm.

named (embedded) Aluffi algebra. The algebra is a sort of ""intermediate""
algebra between the symmetric algebra and the Rees algebra of an ideal, which
serves the purpose of introducing the characteristic cycle of a hypersurface in
intersection theory. The results described in the present paper have an
algebraic flavor and naturally connect with various themes of commutative
algebra, such as standard bases \'a la Hironaka, Artin--Rees like questions,
Valabrega--Valla ideals, ideals of linear type, relation type and analytic
spread. We give estimates for the dimension of the Aluffi algebra and show
that, pretty generally, the latter is equidimensional whenever the base ring is
a hypersurface ring. There is a converse to this under certain conditions that
essentially subsume the setup in Aluffi's theory, thus suggesting that this
algebra will not handle cases other than the singular locus of a hypersurface.
The torsion and the structure of the minimal primes of the algebra are
clarified. In the case of a projective hypersurface the results are more
precise and one is naturally led to look at families of projective plane
singular curves to understand how the property of being of linear type
deforms/specializes for the singular locus of a member. It is fairly elementary
to show that the singular locus of an irreducible curve of degree at most 3 is
of linear type. This is roundly false in degree larger than 4 and the picture
looks pretty wild as we point out by means of some families. Degree 4 is the
intriguing case. Here we are able to show that the singular locus of the
generic member of a family of rational quartics, fixing the singularity type,
is of linear type. We conjecture that every irreducible quartic has singular
locus of linear type.

number of differential equations. For linear systems, different forms of the
hypergeometric or the confluent hypergeometric equations often suffice to
describe the system studied. These equations have power series solutions with
simple relations between consecutive coefficients and/ or can be represented in
terms of simple integral transforms. If the problem is nonlinear, one often
uses one form of the Painlev\'{e} equations. There are important examples,
however, where one has to use higher order equations. Heun equation is one of
these examples, which recently is often encountered in problems in general
relativity and astrophysics. Its special and confluent forms take names as
Mathieu, Lam\'{e} and Coulomb spheroidal equations. For these equations
whenever a power series solution is written, instead of a two-way recursion
relation between the coefficients in the series, we find one between three or
four different ones. An integral transform solution using simpler functions
also is not obtainable. The use of this equation in physics and mathematical
literature exploded in the later years, more than doubling the number of papers
with these solutions in the last decade, compared to time period since this

relations in artificial crystals. The crystal's structural length scales may
range from nano- (light) up to centimeters (sound waves). Because of their
emergent properties these materials are called metamaterials. Different to
photonics, where the dielectric constant dominantly determines the index of
refraction, in a ferromagnet the spin-wave index of refraction can be
dramatically changed already by the magnetization direction. This allows a
different flexibility in realizing dynamic wave guides or spin-wave switches.
The present review will give an introduction into the novel functionalities of
spin-wave devices, concepts for spin-wave based computing and magnonic
crystals. The parameters of the magnetic metamaterials are adjusted to the
spin-wave k-vector such that the magnonic band structure is designed. However,
already the elementary building block of an antidot lattice, the singular hole,
owns a strongly varying internal potential determined by its magnetic dipole
field and a localization of spin-wave modes. Photo-magnonics reveal a way to
investigate the control over the interplay between localization and
delocalization of the spin-wave modes using femtosecond lasers, which is a
major focus of this review. We will discuss the crucial parameters to realize
free Bloch states and how, by contrast, a controlled localization might allow
to gradually turn on and manipulate spin-wave interactions in spin-wave based

acts as a flexible valve that buckles under the combined effects of pressure
forces and the mechanical stimulation of trigger hairs, and not as a panel
articulated on hinges. This model combines two different approaches, namely (i)
the description of thin membranes as triangle meshes with strain and curvature
energy, and (ii) the molecular dynamics approach, which consists in computing
the time evolution of the position of each vertex of the mesh according to
Langevin equations. The only free parameter in the expression of the elastic
energy is the Young's modulus E of the membranes. The values for this parameter
are unequivocally obtained by requiring that the trap model fires, like real
traps, when the pressure difference between the outside and the inside of the
trap reaches about 15 kPa. Among other results, our simulations show that, for
a pressure difference slightly larger than the critical one, the door buckles,
slides on the threshold and finally swings wide open, in excellent agreement

is much reduced compared to the bulk sample. We observed a non-monotonic

for $d < 50$ nm it decreases again. The initial enhancement in $T_C$ was
related to an increase in the bandwidth that occured due to a compaction of the
Mn-O bond length and a straightening of the Mn-O-Mn bond angle, as determined
form the neutron data. The size reduction also changes the nature of the
ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition from first order to second order with
critical exponents approaching mean field values. This was explained as arising
from a truncation of the coherence length by the finite sample size.

of repeated reflection, transmission and trapping regions for increasing
strengths of an optical lattice defect are shown to be due to impurity modes
inside the defect potential with chemical potentials and numbers of atoms
matching corresponding quantities of an incoming gap-soliton. For gap-solitons
with chemical potentials very close to band edges, the number of resonances
observed in the scattering coincides with the number of bound states which can
exist in the defect potential for the given defect strength. The dependence of
the positions and widths of the transmission resonant on the incoming
gap-soliton velocities are investigated by means of a defect mode analysis and
effective mass theory. The comparisons with direct integrations of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation provide a very good agreement confirming the
correctness of our interpretation. The possibility of multiple resonant
transmission through arrays of optical lattice defects is also demonstrated. In
particular, we show that it is possible to design the strength of the defects
so to balance the velocity detunings and to allow the resonant transmission
through a larger number of defects. The possibility of using these results for
very precise gap-soliton dynamical filters is suggested.

function, i. e. it is subject to stronger modifications upon changing of the
dot charge state. These conclusions are corroborated by time-resolved
photoluminescence studies of recombination lifetimes of different excitonic

strong confinement and result from a relatively shallow potential in the

outer radius of the ADAF $\dot{m}_{\rm out}$ and outflow strength parameter
$p$. Our calculations show that the equivalent widths of thermal iron lines
emitted from the pure ADAF, i.e., the ADAF without outflows, should be very
small, assuming a solar metallicity for the accreting gas in the accretion
flow. Strong thermal iron lines are expected to be emitted from the ADAF with
relatively strong outflows. {For reasonable choice of parameters, the total
equivalent width of the He-like and H-like thermal iron lines reaches to
$\gtrsim 500$ eV for accreting gas with solar metallicity. The observation of
strong thermal X-ray lines from GX 339-4 at the off state may give a clue to
the accretion mode of the source and provide evidence for the presence of
outflows/winds in the accretion flow around the black hole in GX 339-4. It is
found that the values of $\dot{m}_{\rm out}$ and $p$ are degenerate, i.e., the
observed X-ray continuum spectrum can be fairly well reproduced with different
sets of the parameters $\dot{m}_{\rm out}$ and $p$. Such {degeneracy} can be
broken when the thermal X-ray line emission data is available. We also compare

the part of a message, and virality, defined as the probability that it be sent
along, is of significant theoretical and practical importance, e.g. for viral
marketing. A quantitative study of emailing of articles from the NY Times finds
a strong link between positive affect and virality, and, based on psychological
theories it is concluded that this relation is universally valid. The
conclusion appears to be in contrast with classic theory of diffusion in news
media emphasizing negative affect as promoting propagation. In this paper we
explore the apparent paradox in a quantitative analysis of information
diffusion on Twitter. Twitter is interesting in this context as it has been
shown to present both the characteristics social and news media. The basic
measure of virality in Twitter is the probability of retweet. Twitter is
different from email in that retweeting does not depend on pre-existing social
relations, but often occur among strangers, thus in this respect Twitter may be
more similar to traditional news media. We therefore hypothesize that negative
news content is more likely to be retweeted, while for non-news tweets positive
sentiments support virality. To test the hypothesis we analyze three corpora: A
complete sample of tweets about the COP15 climate summit, a random sample of
tweets, and a general text corpus including news. The latter allows us to train
a classifier that can distinguish tweets that carry news and non-news
information. We present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in
the news segment, but not in the non-news segment. We conclude that the
relation between affect and virality is more complex than expected based on the
findings of Berger and Milkman (2010), in short 'if you want to be cited: Sweet
talk your friends or serve bad news to the public'.

planet formation model developed in Alibert et al. (2005a), which
self-consistently takes into account planetary growth and migration in an
evolving proto-planetary disk. Using this model, we generate synthetic
populations of planets by following their growth in a large number of
proto-planetary disks, whose properties (mass and lifetime) are selected in a
Monte Carlo fashion using probability distributions derived from observations.
We show that the scaling of the proto-planetary disk mass with the mass of the
central star has a direct and large influence on the properties of the
resulting planet population. In particular, the observed paucity of large mass
planets orbiting 0.5 Msun stars can directly be explained as resulting from a
only slightly steeper than linear scaling. The observed lack of short period
planet orbiting 2.0 Msun stars can also be attributed to this scaling but only
if associated with a decrease of the mean disk lifetime for stars more massive
than 1.5 Msun. Finally, we show that the distribution of minimum mass and

largest gas-phase molecules in space. Whether referred to as gas or dust, these
PAHs can contain up to 20% of the total cosmic carbon abundance and as such
also play an important role in the carbon chemistry of protoplanetary disks.
The interpretation of PAH bands is often a complex procedure involving not only
gas physics to determine their ionization stage and temperature, but also
radiative transfer effects that can bury these bands in a strong thermal
continuum from a population of larger dust particles.
  PAHs are most readily seen in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
disks around Herbig AeBe stars where they are photoprocessed by the stellar
radiation field. Resolved images taken in the PAH bands confirm their origin in
the flaring surfaces of circumstellar disks: if the SED is consistent with a
flat disk structure (less illuminated), there is little or no evidence of PAH
emission. The very low detection rates in the disks around T Tauri stars often
require an overall lower abundance of PAHs in these disk surface as compared to
that in molecular clouds.
  In this review, I will adress three aspects of PAHs in protoplanetary disks:
(1) Do PAHs form in protoplanetary disks or do they originate from the
precursor molecular cloud? (2) Is the presence of PAH features in SEDs a
consequence of the disk structure or do PAHs in fact shape the disk structure?
(3) How can we use PAHs as tracers of processes in protoplanetary disks?

outstanding tests of inflationary cosmology. One of the necessary steps for
extracting polarization information in the CMB is reducing contamination from
so-called ""ambiguous modes"" on a masked sky, which contain leakage from the
larger E-mode signal. This can be achieved by utilising derivative operators on
the real-space Stokes Q and U parameters. This paper presents an algorithm and
a software package to perform this procedure on the nearly full sky, i.e., with
projects such as the Planck Surveyor and future satellites in mind; in
particular, the package can perform finite differences on masked, irregular
grids and is applied to a semi-regular spherical pixellization, the HEALPix
grid. The formalism reduces to the known finite-difference solutions in the
case of a regular grid. We quantify full-sky improvements on the possible
bounds on the CMB B-mode signal. We find that in the specific case of E and
B-mode separation, there exists a ""pole problem"" in our formalism which
produces signal contamination at very low multipoles l. Several solutions to
the ""pole problem"" are presented; one proposed solution facilitates a
calculation of a general Gaussian quadrature scheme, which finds application in
calculating accurate harmonic coefficients on the HEALPix sphere. Nevertheless,
on a masked sphere the software represents a considerable reduction in B-mode
noise from limited sky coverage.

proposed to select another source as its SI during the decoding. The methods
operate based on minimum physical distance (in a wireless sensor network

flatter values similar to those measured at z ~ 3. The break luminosity, though
poorly constrained, is at M* = -24.1(+0.7/-1.9), approximately 1 - 1.5 mag

to f electron systems, such as cerium, cerium oxide (Ce2O3) and plutonium oxide

terms, we find that the calculation of the self-consistent density is
mandatory. The formalism is general and does not depend on the method used to
solve the impurity model. Calculations are carried out within the Hubbard I

correlated insulators. We compare the DFT+DMFT and DFT+U solutions, and
underline the qualitative differences of their converged densities. We
emphasize that in contrast to DFT+U, DFT+DMFT does not break the spin and
orbital symmetry. As a consequence, DFT+DMFT implies, on top of a better
physical description of correlated metals and insulators, a reduced occurrence
of unphysical metastable solutions in correlated insulators in comparison to

We find that the combination of quadrupole-quadrupole and van der Waals
interactions compete with the rotational energy of the dimer, limiting the
range of validity of the perturbative approach to distances larger than 100

uniform density cloud, which show universal scaling behavior as a function of
increasing interactions. An analytical formula is proposed on the basis of
bosonization, which describes the density oscillations for all interaction
strengths. The wavelength of the dominant oscillation changes with interaction,
which indicates the crossover to a spin-incoherent regime. Using the Bethe
ansatz the shape of the uniform fermion cloud is analyzed in detail, which can
be described by a universal scaling form.

in the theory of finite and affine Lie theory. However, it is known that such a

systems such as extended affine root systems and affine reflection systems. As
an alternative, we introduce the notion of a ""reflectable base"", a minimal
subset $\Pi$ of roots such that the non-isotropic part of the root system can
be recovered by reflecting roots of $\Pi$ relative to the hyperplanes
determined by $\Pi$. We give a full characterization of reflectable bases for
tame irreducible affine reflection systems of reduced types, excluding types
$E_{6,7,8}$. As a byproduct of our results, we show that if the root system
under consideration is locally finite then any reflectable base is an integral

was carried out with a Bayesian multi-planet Kepler periodogram (from 1 to 6
planets) based on a fusion Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In all cases the
analysis included an unknown parameterized stellar jitter noise term. For the
HARPS data set the most probable number of planetary signals detected is 5 with
a Bayesian false alarm probability of 0.01. These include the
$3.1498\pm0.0005$, $5.3687\pm0.0002$, $12.927_{-0.004}^{+0.006}$, and
$66.9\pm0.2$d periods reported previously plus a $399_{-16}^{+14}$d period. The
orbital eccentricities are $0.0_{-0.0}^{+0.2}$, $0.00_{-0.00}^{+0.02}$,
$0.10_{-0.10}^{+0.06}$, $0.33_{-0.10}^{+0.09}$, and $0.02_{-0.02}^{+0.30}$,
respectively. The semi-major axis and $M sin i$ of the 5 planets are

$6.6_{-2.7}^{+2.0}$M$_{\earth}$), respectively. The analysis of the HIRES data
set yielded a reliable detection of only the strongest 5.37 and 12.9 day
periods. The analysis of the combined HIRES/HARPS data again only reliably
detected the 5.37 and 12.9d periods. Detection of 4 planetary signals with
periods of 3.15, 5.37, 12.9, and 66.9d was only achieved by including an
additional unknown but parameterized Gaussian error term added in quadrature to
the HIRES quoted errors. The marginal distribution for the sigma of this
additional error term has a well defined peak at $1.8\pm0.4$m s$^{-1}$. It is
possible that this additional error arises from unidentified systematic
effects. We did not find clear evidence for a fifth planetary signal in the
combined HIRES/HARPS data set.
