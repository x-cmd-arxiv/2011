mercury-manganese (HgMn) stars, Xe II oscillator strengths are only available
for a very limited number of transitions. As a consequence, several
unidentified lines in the spectra of HgMn stars could be due to Xe II. In
addition, some predicted Xe II lines are redshifted by about 0.1 A from stellar
unidentified lines, raising the question about the wavelength accuracy of the
Xe II line data available in the literature. For these reasons we investigated
the Xe II lines lying in the 3900-4521 A, 4769-7542 A, and 7660-8000 A spectral
ranges of four well-studied HgMn stars. We compared the Xe II wavelengths
listed in the NIST database with the position of the lines observed in the
high-resolution UVES spectrum of the xenon-overabundant, slowly rotating HgMn
stars HR 6000, and we modified them when needed. We derived astrophysical
oscillator strengths for all the Xe II observed lines and compared them with
the literature values, when available. In this framework, we performed a
complete abundance analysis of HD 71066, while we relied on our previous works
for the other stars. We find that all the lines with wavelengths related to the
6d and 7s energy levels have a corresponding unidentified spectral line,
blueshifted by the same quantity of about 0.1 A in all the four stars, so that
we identified these lines as coming from Xe II and modified their NIST
wavelength value according to the observed stellar value. We find that the Xe
II stellar oscillator strengths may differ from one star to another from 0.0
dex to 0.3 dex. We adopted the average of the oscillator strengths derived from

that, in general, the density of states exhibits power-law frequency dependence

reflects the behavior of the tunneling density of states at the end of a
Luttinger-liquid, and is insensitive either to the value of the dot-lead
interaction or to the strength of dissipation; otherwise it depends on these
couplings too. This behavior should be contrasted with the thermodynamic
properties of the level, in particular, its occupancy, which were previously
shown to depend on the various interactions in the system only through the
corresponding Fermi edge singularity exponent, and thus cannot display any
Luttinger-liquid specific power-law. Hence, we can construct different models,

rather difficult to give a correct weakly nonlinear analysis. In this paper we
give a detailed derivation of the appropriate amplitude equation based on the

deal with the distinct properties mentioned above. First the deformable surface
requires a fully dynamic treatment of the instability and the observed
stationary case can be interpreted as the limiting case of a frozen-in
characteristic mode. Second, the fact that the driving force is manifest in the

combination of solubility conditions and (normal stress) boundary conditions
has to be invoked in all orders of the expansions.

separation in wave equation, which enables one, in principle, to rigorously
examine any limiting case --- from negligibly weak to arbitrarily strong
disorder. It is shown that the effect of disorder-induced scattering can be
properly described in terms of two geometric potentials, specifically, the
""amplitude"" and the ""gradient"" potentials, which appear in wave equation in the
course of conformal smoothing of the resonator boundaries. The scattering
resulting from the gradient potential appears to be dominant, and its impact on
the whole spectrum is governed by the unique sharpness parameter $\Xi$, the
mean tangent of the asperity slope. As opposed to the resonator with bulk
disorder, the distribution of nearest-neighbor spacings (NNS) in the
rough-resonator spectrum acquires Wigner-like features only when the wave
operator loses its unitarity, i.e., with the availability in the system of
either openness or dissipation channels. Our numeric experiments suggest that
in the absence of dissipation loss the random-rough resonator spectrum is
always regular, whatever the degree of roughness. Yet, the spectrum structure
is quite different in the domains of small and large values of the parameter
$\Xi$. For the dissipation-free resonator, the NNS distribution changes its
form with growing the asperity sharpness from Poissonian-like distribution in
the limit of $\Xi<<1$ to the bell-shaped distribution in the domain where
$\Xi>>1$.

modifying the three-body interactions of the Stillinger-Weber potential for
silicon. This modification reduces the average coordination number and
consequently shifts the liquid-gas phase coexistence curve to low densities,
thus facilitating the formation of gels without phase separation. At low
temperatures and densities, the structure of the system is characterized by the
presence of long linear chains interconnected by a small number of three
coordinated junctions at random locations. At small wave-vectors the static
structure factor shows a non-monotonic dependence on temperature, a behavior
which is due to the competition between the percolation transition of the
particles and the stiffening of the formed chains. We compare in detail the
relaxation dynamics of the system as obtained from molecular dynamics with the
one obtained from Monte Carlo dynamics. We find that the bond correlation
function displays stretched exponential behavior at moderately low temperatures
and densities, but exponential relaxation at low temperatures. The bond
lifetime shows an Arrhenius behavior, independent of the microscopic dynamics.
For the molecular dynamics at low temperatures, the mean squared displacement
and the (coherent and incoherent) intermediate scattering function display at
intermediate times a dynamics with ballistic character and we show that this
leads to compressed exponential relaxation. For the Monte Carlo dynamics we
find always an exponential or stretched exponential relaxation. Thus we
conclude that the compressed exponential relaxation observed in experiments is
due to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics.

>> mu will slowly inspiral as gravitational radiation extracts energy and
angular momentum from its orbit. This inspiral can be considered adiabatic when
the orbital period is much shorter than the timescale on which energy is
radiated, and quasi-circular when the radial velocity is much less than the
azimuthal velocity. Although the inspiral always remains adiabatic provided mu
<< M, the quasi-circular approximation breaks down as the particle approaches
the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). In this paper, we relax the
quasi-circular approximation and solve the radial equation of motion explicitly
near the ISCO. We use the requirement that the test particle's 4-velocity
remain properly normalized to calculate a new contribution to the difference
between its energy and angular momentum. This difference determines how a black
hole's spin changes following a test-particle merger, and can be extrapolated
to help predict the mass and spin of the final black hole produced in
finite-mass-ratio black-hole mergers. Our new contribution is particularly
important for nearly maximally spinning black holes, as it can affect whether a
merger produces a naked singularity.

Results. The lithium abundances that we derive for the 27 stars in our sample
follow a clear evolutionary pattern ranging from the turn-off to the Red Giant

time-of-arrival of pulsar signals potentially measurable via precision timing

instrumental, propagation, and other noises fundamentally limiting pulsar
timing observations. Reaching expected GW signal strengths will require
estimation and removal of $\simeq$99% of time-of-arrival fluctuations caused by
typical interstellar plasma turbulence and a reduction of white rms timing
noise to $\sim$100 nsec or less. If these were achieved, single-pulsar
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = 1 sensitivity is then limited by the best current
terrestrial time standards at $h_{rms} \sim$2 $\times 10^{-16}$ [f/(1
cycle/year)]$^{-1/2}$ for $f < 3 \times 10^{-8}$ Hz, where f is Fourier
frequency and a bandwidth of 1 cycle/(10 years) is assumed. This sensitivity
envelope may be optimistic in that it assumes negligible intrinsic pulsar
rotational noise, perfect time transfer from time standard to observatory, and
stable pulse profiles. Nonetheless it can be compared to predicted signal
levels for a broadband astrophysical GW background from supermassive black hole
binaries. Such a background is comparable to timekeeping-noise only for
frequencies lower than about 1 cycle/(10 years), indicating that reliable
detections will require substantial improvements in signal-to-noise ratio
through pulsar array signal processing.

encounter serious difficulties. Categorical ideas seem to arise naturally on
the path to a remedy. Such an approach was suggested and initiated by Segal in
his pioneering article \cite{segal}. In our paper we follow his ideas from a
different perspective, slightly more categorical, and strongly inspired by the
point-free topology.
  First, we develop a general (point-free) concept of measurability (extending
the standard Lebesgue integration when applying to the classical
$\sigma$-algebra). Second (and here we have a major difference from the
classical theory), we prove that every finite-additive function $\mu$ with
values in $[0,1]$ can be extended to a measure on an abstract $\sigma$-algebra;
this correspondence is functorial and yields uniqueness. As an example we show
that the Segal space can be characterized by completely canonical data.
Furthermore, from our results it follows that a satisfactory point-free
integration arises everywhere where we have a finite-additive probability
function on a Boolean algebra.

version of quantum mechanics which they call ""modal quantum theory"" but which

instantiating the mathematical framework of Hilbert spaces with a finite field
instead of the field of complex numbers. This instantiation collapses much the
structure of actual quantum mechanics but retains several of its distinguishing
characteristics including the notions of superposition, interference, and
entanglement. Furthermore, discrete quantum theory excludes local hidden
variable models, has a no-cloning theorem, and can express natural counterparts
of quantum information protocols such as superdense coding and teleportation.
Our first result is to distill a model of discrete quantum computing from this
quantum theory. The model is expressed using a monadic metalanguage built on
top of a universal reversible language for finite computations, and hence is
directly implementable in a language like Haskell. In addition to
superpositions and invertible linear maps, the model includes conventional
programming constructs including pairs, sums, higher-order functions, and
recursion. Our second result is to relate this programming model to relational
programming, e.g., a pure version of Prolog over finite relations. Surprisingly
discrete quantum computing is identical to conventional logic programming
except for a small twist that is responsible for all the ``quantum-ness.'' The
twist occurs when merging sets of answers computed by several alternatives: the
answers are combined using an ""exclusive"" version of logical disjunction. In
other words, the two branches of a choice junction exhibit an ""interference""
effect: an answer is produced from the junction if it occurs in one or the
other branch but not both.

not generally bimodal, in strong distinction with the bimodal Galactic globular
distribution. Rather, the M31 distribution shows a broad peak, centered at
[Fe/H]=-1, suggesting that the cluster systems of M31 and the Milky Way had
different formation histories. Ages for clusters with [Fe/H] > -1 were
determined using the automatic stellar population analysis program EZ_Ages. We
find no evidence for massive clusters in M31 with intermediate ages. Moreover,

Sky Survey (SDSS) at z=0.1. These datasets cover an equally deep mass range of
8.5<~log(M*/Msun)<~11 at both epochs. We find that the SSFR--mass relation
evolves in a way which is remarkably independent of stellar mass, as we
previously found for the star-formation rate density (SFRD)--mass relation. At
higher masses, such as those probed by previous surveys, the evolution in
SSFR--mass is almost independent of stellar mass. At higher masses
(log(M*/Msun)>10) the shapes of the cumulative cosmic SFRDs are very similar at
both z=0.1 and z=1.0, both showing 70% of the total SFRD above a mass of
log(M*/Msun)>10. Mass functions are constructed for star-forming galaxies and
found to evolve by only <35% between z=1 and z=0.1 over the whole mass range.
The evolution is such that the mass function decreases with increasing cosmic
time, confirming that galaxies are leaving the star-forming sequence/blue
cloud. The observational results are extended to z~2 by adding two recent Lyman
break galaxy samples, and data at these three epochs (z=0.1, 1, 2) are compared
with the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. GALFORM predicts an
overall SFR density (SFRD) as a function of stellar mass in reasonable
agreement with the observations. The star formation timescales inferred from

properties of the bulge components of their host galaxies. In contrast, they
appear not to correlate with galaxy disks. Disk-grown pseudobulges are
intermediate in properties between bulges and disks. It has been unclear
whether they do or do not correlate with black holes in the same way that
bulges do, because too few pseudobulges were classified to provide a clear
result. At stake are conclusions about which parts of galaxies coevolve with
black holes, possibly by being regulated by energy feedback from black holes.
Here we report pseudobulge classifications for galaxies with dynamically
detected black holes and combine them with recent measurements of velocity
dispersions in the biggest bulgeless galaxies. These data confirm that black
holes do not correlate with disks and show that they correlate little or not at
all with pseudobulges. We suggest that there are two different modes of black
hole feeding. Black holes in bulges grow rapidly to high masses when mergers
drive gas infall that feeds quasar-like events. In contrast, small black holes
in bulgeless galaxies and galaxies with pseudobulges grow as low-level
Seyferts. Growth of the former is driven by global processes, so the biggest
black holes coevolve with bulges, but growth of the latter is driven locally
and stochastically, and they do not coevolve with disks and pseudobulges.

simulate observational results associated with fundamental sausage trapped
modes. Aims: Starting from a non-equilibrium state with a dense chromospheric
layer, we analyse the evolution of the internal plasma dynamics of magnetic
loops, subject to line-tying boundary conditions, and with the coronal
parameters described in Asai et al. (2001) and Melnikov et al. (2002) to
investigate the onset and damping of sausage modes. Methods: To integrate the
equations we used a high resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) method specially
designed to deal appropriately with flow discontinuities. Results: Due to
non-linearities and inhomogeneities, pure modes are difficult to sustain and
always occur coupled among them so as to satisfy, e.g., the line-tying
constraint. We found that, in one case, the resonant coupling of the sausage
fundamental mode with a slow one results in a non-dissipative damping of the
former. Conclusions: In scenarios of thick and dense loops, where the
analytical theory predicts the existence of fundamental trapped sausage modes,
the coupling of fast and slow quasi-periodic modes -with a node at the center
of the longitudinal speed- occur contributing to the damping of the fast mode.
If a discontinuity in the total pressure between the loop and the corona is
assumed, a fundamental fast sausage transitory leaky regime is spontaneously
produced and an external compressional Alfv\'en wave takes away the magnetic
energy.

images from three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of misaligned (tilted) accretion flows using relativistic radiative
transfer, and compare the estimated locations of the radiation edge with
expectations from their aligned (untilted) counterparts. The radiation edge in
the tilted simulations is independent of black hole spin for a tilt of 15
degrees, in stark contrast to the results for untilted simulations, which agree
with the monotonic dependence on spin expected from thin accretion disk theory.
Synthetic emission line profiles from the tilted simulations depend strongly on
the observer's azimuth, and exhibit unique features such as broad ""blue wings.""
Coupled with precession, the azimuthal variation could generate time
fluctuations in observed emission lines, which would be a clear ""signature"" of
a tilted accretion flow. Finally, we evaluate the possibility that the observed
low- and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from black hole
binaries could be produced by misaligned accretion flows. Although
low-frequency QPOs from precessing, tilted disks remains a viable option, we
find little evidence for significant power in our light curves in the frequency

originate from galaxy evolution and disruption. We present a kinematic study of
the ICL in the Hydra I cluster core, using planetary nebulas (PNs) as tracers.
We used multi-slit imaging spectroscopy with FORS2 on VLT-UT1 to detect 56 PNs
associated with diffuse light in the central 100 x 100 kpc^2 of Hydra I. We
measured their [OIII] magnitudes, sky positions, and velocity distribution
(LOSVD), and compared with the phase-space distribution of nearby galaxies. The
luminosity function of the detected PNs is consistent with that expected at a
distance of ~50 Mpc. Their number density is ~4 times lower for the light seen
than expected, and we discuss ram pressure stripping of the PNs by the hot ICM
as one of the possible explanations. The LOSVD histogram of the PNs is highly
non-Gaussian and multipeaked: it is dominated by a broad central component with
sigma~500 km/s at around the average velocity of the cluster, and shows two
additional narrower peaks at 1800 km/s and 5000 km/s. The main component is
broadly consistent with the outward continuation of the intracluster halo of
NGC 3311, which was earlier shown to have a velocity dispersion of ~470 km/s at
radii of >50"". Galaxies with velocities in this range are absent in the central
100 x 100 kpc^2 and may have been disrupted earlier to build this component.
The PNs in the second peak in the LOSVD at 5000 km/s are coincident spatially
and in velocities with a group of dwarf galaxies in the MSIS field. They may
trace the debris from the ongoing tidal disruption of these galaxies. Most of
the diffuse light in the core of Hydra is still not phase-mixed. The build-up
of ICL and the dynamically hot cD halo around NGC 3311 are ongoing, through the
accretion of material from galaxies falling into the cluster core and tidally

response to random, altitude-dependent nozzle side-loads, is investigated. Side
loads arise during low altitude flight due to random, asymmetric, shock-induced
separation of in-nozzle boundary layers. In this paper, stochastic evolution of
the in-nozzle boundary layer separation line, an essential feature underlying
side load generation, is connected to random, altitude-dependent rotational and
translational rocket response via a set of simple analytical models. Separation
line motion, extant on a fast boundary layer time scale, is modeled as an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Pitch and yaw responses, taking place on a long,
rocket dynamics time scale, are shown to likewise evolve as OU processes.
Stochastic, altitude-dependent rocket translational motion follows from linear,
asymptotic versions of the full nonlinear equations of motion; the model is
valid in the practical limit where random pitch, yaw, and roll rates all remain
small. Computed altitudedependent rotational and translational velocity and
displacement statistics are compared against those obtained using recently
reported high fidelity simulations [Srivastava, Tkacik, and Keanini, J. Applied
Phys., 108, 044911 (2010)]; in every case, reasonable agreement is observed. As
an important prelude, evidence indicating the physical consistency of the model
introduced in the above article is first presented: it is shown that the
study's separation line model allows direct derivation of experimentally
observed side load amplitude and direction densities. Finally, it is found that
the analytical models proposed in this paper allow straightforward
identification of practical approaches for: i) reducing pitch/yaw response to
side loads, and ii) enhancing pitch/yaw damping once side loads cease.

of the highest energy cosmic rays are crucial steps towards the identification
of their sources. We discuss a possible distortion of the cosmic ray flux
induced by the anisotropic and inhomogeneous distribution of extragalactic
magnetic fields in cases where sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are rare
transient phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts and/or newly born magnetars. This
distortion does not involve an angular deflection but the modulation of the
flux related to the probability of seeing the source on an experiment lifetime.
To quantify this distortion, we construct sky maps of the arrival directions of
these highest energy cosmic rays for various magnetic field configurations and
appeal to statistical tests proposed in the literature. We conclude that this
distortion cannot affect present experiments but should be considered when
performing anisotropy studies with future large-scale experiments that record
as many as hundreds of events above 6x10^19 eV.

sample. Our goal is to find a distribution minimizing the expected estimation
error against an adversarially chosen Lipschitz continuous function. Our work
falls into the broad class of estimating aggregate statistics of a function
from a small number of carefully chosen samples. The general problem has a wide
range of practical applications in areas as diverse as sensor networks, social
sciences and numerical analysis. However, traditional work in numerical
analysis has focused on asymptotic bounds, whereas we are interested in the
\emph{best} algorithm. For arbitrary discrete metric spaces of bounded doubling
dimension, we obtain a PTAS for this problem. In the special case when the
points lie on a line, the running time improves to an FPTAS. Both algorithms
are based on approximately solving a linear program with an infinite set of
constraints, by using an approximate separation oracle. For
Lipschitz-continuous functions over $[0,1]$, we calculate the precise
achievable error as $1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.134$, which improves upon
the \quarter which is best possible for deterministic algorithms.

approach based on template-guided fluidic assembly of high mobility building
blocks - single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) - to fabricate ultra-thin and
anisotropic SWNT films. A major advancement is the complete control over the
anisotropy in the assembled nanostructure, realized by three-dimensional
engineering of dip-coated SWNT thin films into alternating hydrophilic and
hydrophobic micro-line patterns with prescribed intra/inter-line widths and
line thicknesses. Variations in the contact line profile results in an
evaporation-controlled assembly mechanism that leads to the formation of an
alternating, and more importantly, contiguous SWNT network. Evidently, the
nanoscopic thickness modulations are direct reflections of the substrate
geometry and chemistry. The nanostructured film exhibits significant anisotropy
in their electrical and thermal transport properties as well as optical
transparency, as revealed by characterization studies. The direct interplay
between the anisotropy and the 3D micro-line patterns of the substrate combined
with the wafer-level scalability of the fluidic assembly allows us to tune the

optical/IR time variability properties of these blazars to be remarkably
similar to those at the gamma-ray energies. The power spectral density (PSD)
functions of the R-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple
power-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude
variability on longer timescales. No clear break is identified in the PSD of
any of the sources. The average slope of the PSD of R-band variability of these
blazars is similar to what was found by the Fermi team for the gamma-ray
variability of a larger sample of bright blazars. This is consistent with
leptonic models where the optical-IR and gamma-ray emission is generated by the
same population of electrons through synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes,
respectively. The prominent flares present in the optical-IR as well as the
gamma-ray light curves of these blazars are predominantly symmetric, i.e., have
similar rise and decay timescales, indicating that the long-term variability is
dominated by the crossing time of radiation or a disturbance through the
emission region rather than by the acceleration or energy-loss timescales of
the radiating electrons. In the blazar 3C 454.3, which has the highest-quality
light curves, the location of a large gamma-ray outburst during 2009 December
is consistent with being in the jet at ~18 pc from the central engine. This

the ground state of (Mg,Fe)(Si,Fe)O$_3$ perovskite, a major mineral phase in
the Earth's lower mantle, has high-spin ferric iron ($S=5/2$) at both the
dodecahedral (A) and octahedral (B) site. As the pressure increases, the B-site
iron undergoes a spin-state crossover to the low-spin state ($S=1/2$), while
the A-site iron remains in the high-spin state. Our calculation shows that the
B-site spin-state crossover in the pressure range of 40-70 GPa is accompanied
by a noticeable volume reduction and an increase in quadrupole splitting,
consistent with recent X-ray diffraction and M\""ossbauer spectroscopy
measurements. The volume reduction leads to a significant softening in the bulk
modulus, which suggests a possible source of seismic velocity anomalies in the
lower mantle.

multiple access protocols makes the analysis of interference, outage, and other

assume that nodes are distributed either as a Poisson point process (PPP) or a
grid, and utilize the independence properties of the PPP (or the regular
structure of the grid) to analyze interference, outage and other metrics.
But,the independence of node locations makes the PPP a dubious model for
nontrivial MACs which intentionally introduce correlations, e.g. spatial
separation, while the grid is too idealized to model real networks. In this
paper, we introduce a new technique based on the factorial moment expansion of
functionals of point processes to analyze functions of interference, in
particular outage probability. We provide a Taylor-series type expansion of
functions of interference, wherein increasing the number of terms in the series
provides a better approximation at the cost of increased complexity of
computation. Various examples illustrate how this new approach can be used to
find outage probability in both Poisson and non-Poisson wireless networks.

couplings by the Hartree-Fock approximation combined with the adiabatic
approximation. In a weakly-correlated region, we find a metallic state
accompanied by \sqroot3x\sqroot3 charge ordering. On the other hand, we obtain
an insulating phase with spin-ferro and orbital-ferro ordering in a wide range
from intermediate to strong correlation. These phases share many
characteristics with the low-temperature states of AgNiO2 and NaNiO2,
respectively. The charge-ordered metallic phase is stabilized by a compromise
between Coulomb repulsions and effective attractive interactions originating
from the breathing-type electronphonon coupling as well as the Hund's-rule
coupling. The spin-orbital-ordered insulating phase is stabilized by the
cooperative effect of electron correlations and the Jahn-Teller coupling, while
the Hund's-rule coupling also plays a role in the competition with other
orbital-ordered phases. The results suggest a unified way of understanding a
variety of low-temperature phases in ANiO2. We also discuss a keen competition

a base station in a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the nodes are
sleep-wake cycling periodically and asynchronously. When a node (referred to as
the source) gets a packet to forward, either by detecting an event or from an
upstream node, it has to wait for its neighbors in a forwarding set (referred
to as relays) to wake-up. Each of the relays is associated with a random reward
(e.g., the progress made towards the sink) that is iid. To begin with, the
source is uncertain about the number of relays, their wake-up times and the
reward values, but knows their distributions. At each relay wake-up instant,
when a relay reveals its reward value, the source's problem is to forward the
packet or to wait for further relays to wake-up. In this setting, we seek to
minimize the expected waiting time at the source subject to a lower bound on
the average reward. In terms of the operations research literature, our work
can be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem. We formulate the
relay selection problem as a partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP), where the unknown state is the number of relays. We begin by
considering the case where the source knows the number of relays. For the
general case, where the source only knows a pmf on the number of relays, it has
to maintain a posterior pmf on the number of relays and forward the packet iff
the pmf is in an optimum stopping set. We show that the optimum stopping set is
convex and obtain inner and outer bounds to this set. The computational
complexity of the above policies motivates us to formulate an alternative
simplified model, the optimal policy for which is a simple threshold rule. We
provide simulation results to compare the performance of the various one-hop
and end-to-end forwarding policies.

attention to supercluster-like structures. A grid-density-contour based
algorithm is adopted to locate connected groups. With the increase of the
linking density threshold, the foam- like cosmic web is subsequently broken
into individual supercluster-like groups and further halos which are in
accordance to groups with the linking density threshold {\rho}/{\rho}= 1 +
{\delta} = 80. By analyzing sets of cosmological simulations with varying
cosmological parameters, we find that an universal mass function exists not
only for halos but also for low-density supercluster-like groups until the
linking density threshold decreases to a density where the global percolation
of large-scale structures occurs. We further show that the mass functions of
different groups can be well described by the Jenkins form with the parameters
being dependent on the linking density threshold. On the other hand, these low-
density supercluster-like groups cannot be directly associated with the
predictions from the excursion set theory with effective barriers obtained from
dynamical collapse models, and the peak exclusion effect must be taken into
account. Including such an effect, the mass function of groups with the linking
density threshold 1 + {\delta} = 16 is in good agreements with that from the
excursion set theory with a nearly flat effective barrier. A simplified
analysis of the ellipsoidal collapse model indicates that the barrier for
collapses along two axes to form filaments is approximately flat in scales,
thus we define groups identified with 1 + {\delta} = 16 as filaments. We then
further study the halo-filament conditional mass function and the filament-halo
conditional mass function, and compare them with the predictions from the
two-barrier excursion set theory. The shape statistics for filaments are also

groups. During these mergers, shocks and/or turbulence are created within the
intracluster medium (ICM). In this process, particles could be accelerated to
highly relativistic energies. The synchrotron radiation from these particles is
observed in the form of radio relics and halos that are generally characterized
by a steep radio spectral index. Shocks can also revive fossil radio plasma
from a previous episode of AGN activity, creating a so-called radio phoenix.
Here we present multi-frequency radio observations of diffuse steep-spectrum
radio sources selected from the 74 MHz VLSS survey. Previous GMRT observations
showed that some of these sources had filamentary and elongated morphologies,
which are expected for radio relics.
  We carried out radio continuum observations at 325 MHz with the GMRT.
Observations with the VLA and WSRT were taken at 1.4 GHz in full polarization
mode. Optical images around the radio sources were taken with the WHT and INT
telescopes. Most of the sources in our sample consist of old radio plasma from
AGNs located in small galaxy clusters. The sources can be classified as AGN
relics or radio phoenices. The spectral indices across most of the radio
sources display large variations. We conclude that diffuse steep-spectrum radio
sources are not only found in massive X-ray luminous galaxy clusters but also
in smaller systems. Future low-frequency surveys will uncover large numbers of
steep-spectrum radio relics related to previous episodes of AGN activity.

introduce a nonintersecting system of $N$-tuples of LEBPs in a domain $D$ in

Fomin's determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix whose entries are boundary
Poisson kernels in $D$. We set a sequence of chambers in a planar domain and
observe the first passage points at which $N$ Brownian paths $(\gamma_1,...,

LEBPs in the domain in the sense of Fomin. We prove that the correlation
functions of first passage points of the Brownian paths of the present system
are generally given by determinants specified by a continuous function called

information in the understanding of the formation of comets and protoplanetary
systems, only a few studies up to now have aimed at deriving the HDO/H2O ratio
in low-mass star forming regions. Previous studies of the molecular deuteration
toward the solar-type class 0 protostar, IRAS 16293-2422, have shown that the
D/H ratio of water is significantly lower than other grain-surface-formed
molecules. It is not clear if this property is general or particular to this
source. In order to see if the results toward IRAS 16293-2422 are particular,
we aimed at studying water deuterium fractionation in a second low-mass
solar-type protostar, NGC1333-IRAS2A. Using the 1-D radiative transfer code
RATRAN, we analyzed five HDO transitions observed with the IRAM 30m, JCMT, and
APEX telescopes. We assumed that the abundance profile of HDO in the envelope
is a step function, with two different values in the inner warm (T>100 K) and
outer cold (T<100 K) regions of the protostellar envelope. The inner and outer
abundance of HDO is found to be well constrained at the 3 sigma level. The
obtained HDO inner and outer fractional abundances are x_in=6.6e-8 - 1e-7 and
x_out=9e-11 - 1.8e-9 (3 sigma). These values are close to those in IRAS
16293-2422, which suggests that HDO may be formed by the same mechanisms in
these two solar-type protostars. Taking into account the (rather poorly
constrained) H2O abundance profile deduced from Herschel observations, the
derived HDO/H2O in the inner envelope is larger than 1% and in the outer
envelope it is 0.9%-18%. These values are more than one order of magnitude
higher than what is measured in comets. If the same ratios apply to the

symmetry $Sp(n/2)$ the dynamical spontaneous violation is only achievable for
the number of flavors $n=6$ with simultaneous parity ($R,L-$symmetry)
violation. The see-saw mechanism produces here three light and three heavy
Dirac neutrinos. Majorana states are unavailable here. Neglecting heavy
particles in the $R,L-$symmetric system of weak and electromagnetic
interactions ($R,L-$independent values of isospins Tw and hypercharges $Y$ for
leptons or quarks) leads to a theory with parity nonconservation and axial
anomalies. Only weak left $(L)$ and full $(R+L)$ electromagnetic currents do
not have anomalies and remain independent of the physics of heavy masses. These
currents are the ones of the Standard Model. The absence of anomalies merely in
the combination of currents forming the electromagnetic one presents essential
difference with the SM case, where the both, left $T_W$ and $Y$, currents are
deprived of anomalies independently.

computation model based on Turing Machines that we introduced in a previous
article.
  The use of Turing Machines allows for very simple mechanisms of code growth
and code activation/inactivation through point mutations. To any value of the
point mutation probability corresponds a maximum amount of active code that can
be maintained by selection and the Turing machines that reach it are said to be
at the error threshold. Simulations with our model show that the Turing
machines population evolve towards the error threshold.
  Mathematical descriptions of the model point out that this behaviour is due
more to the mutation-selection dynamics than to the intrinsic nature of the
Turing machines. This indicates that this result is much more general than the
model considered here and could play a role also in biological evolution.

the number of unentangled spins can be reduced to O(1) (versus the typical
value of O(N)), and many-body singlets can be occupied with a population of
$\sim 20 %$ independent of the ensemble size. We implement this approach in a
mesoscopic ensemble of nuclear spins through dynamic nuclear spin polarization
by an electron. The result is of two-fold significance for spin quantum
technology: (1) a resource of entanglement for nuclear spin based quantum
information processing; (2) a cleaner surrounding and less quantum noise for
the electron spin as the environmental spin moments are effectively
annihilated.

simplest and most popular model is Synchrotron, Self-Compton (SSC) emission
produced by internal shocks inside an ultra-relativistic jet. However, recent
observations of a delayed high energy component have encouraged alternative
models. Here we use a recently developed formulation of relativistic shocks to
simulate GRBs. It takes into account the evolution of quantities such as
densities of colliding shells, electric and magnetic fields. We also extend the
previous formulation by considering a precessing external magnetic field. These
simulations are very realistic and present significant improvement with respect
to previous phenomenological GRB simulations. They reproduce light curves of
separated peaks of real GRBs and variety of observed spectral slopes at E >
E_{peak}. The high energy emission can be explained by synchrotron emission and
a subdominant contribution from inverse Compton. We also suggest an explanation
for the extended tail emission observed by the Fermi-LAT instrument and relate
it to the screening of the magnetic field and/or trapping of accelerated
electrons in the electromagnetic energy structure of the plasma in the shock
front. Spectral slopes of simulated bursts at E << E_{peak} are consistent with
theoretical prediction and at E < E_{peak} can be flatter if the spectrum of
electrons is roughly flat or has a shallow slope. The observed flat spectra at
soft gamma-ray and hard x-ray bands is the evidence that there is a significant
contribution at $E < E_{peak}$ from lower Lorentz factor wing of electrons
distribution which have a roughly random acceleration rather than being
thermal. This means that the state of matter in the jet at the time of ejection
is most probably nonthermal and electrons have a shallow spectrum at low
energies.(abbreviated)

However, the dynamics of MHD waves in two-fluid approach is significantly
changed when the wave frequency becomes comparable or higher than ion-neutral

maximum damping rate at particular frequencies (for example, the peak frequency
equals 2.5 ion-neutral collision frequency for 50 % of neutral Hydrogen) in

new mode of slow magneto-acoustic wave appears for higher frequency branch,
which is connected to neutral hydrogen fluid. The single-fluid approach
perfectly deals with slow processes in partially ionized plasmas, but fails for
time-scales smaller than ion-neutral collision time. Therefore, two-fluid
approximation should be used for the description of relatively fast processes.

possible by a combination of new instruments and innovative search techniques.
One of the major aims of such searches is to constrain the epoch of
reionization (EoR), which marks the second major change in the ionization state
of the Universe. Understanding the EoR is difficult since whilst it is galaxy
evolution which drives reionization, reionization itself influences galaxy
evolution through feedback effects. Unraveling the interplay of reionization
and galaxy evolution is further complicated by of a lack of understanding of
the metal enrichment and dust distribution in high redshift galaxies. To this
end, a class of galaxies called Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) have been gaining
enormous popularity as probes of all these three processes. In this thesis, we
couple state of the art cosmological SPH simulations (GADGET-2) with a
physically motivated, self-consistent model for LAEs, so as to be able to
understand the importance of the intergalactic medium (IGM) ionization state,
dust and peculiar velocities in shaping their observed properties. By doing so,
the aim is to gain insight on the nature of LAEs, put precious constraints on
their elusive physical properties and make predictions for future instruments
such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Using our LAE model in
conjunction with a code that builds the MW merger tree (GAMETE), we build a
bridge between the high-redshift and the local Universe. We also use SPH
simulations (GADGET-2) to study the nature of the earliest galaxies that have
been detected as of yet, place constraints on their contribution to
reionization, and predict their detectability using the next generation of
instruments, such as the James Web Space Telescope (JWST).

possibility of gauging the usual electromagnetic duality of Maxwell equations.
By using off-shell manipulations in the context of the Principle of least
action, they conclude that this is not possible, at least with the conventional
compensating gauge fields scheme. Such a conclusion contradicts, however, an
old result of Malik and Pradhan, who showed that it is indeed possible to
introduce an extra abelian gauge field directly in the vacuum Maxwell equations
in order to render them covariant under local duality transformations. Since it
is well known that the equations of motion can, in general, admit more
symmetries than the associate Lagrangian, this would not be a paradoxal result,
in principle. Here, we revisit these works and identify the source of the
different conclusions. We show that the Malik-Pradhan procedure does not
preserve the original Maxwell gauge invariance, while Bunster, Henneaux, and
Deser sought for generalizations which are, by construction, invariant under
the Maxwell gauge transformation. Further, we show that the Malik-Pradhan
construction cannot be adapted or extended in order to preserve the Maxwell
gauge invariance, reinforcing the conclusion that it is not possible to gauge

The site-selective NMR is the best and the only tool used to extract

constructed here is in quantitative agreement with the theories in a strong

not due to the development of AFM spin fluctuations, but because the structural

KV-trellises. These trellises are based on characteristic generators, as
introduced by Koetter/Vardy (2003), and may be regarded as a natural
generalization of minimal conventional trellises, even though they are not
necessarily minimal. Two dualization techniques will be investigated: the local
dualization, introduced by Forney (2001) for general normal graphs, and a
linear algebra based dualization tailored to the specific class of tail-biting
BCJR-trellises, introduced by Nori/Shankar (2006). It turns out that, in
general, the BCJR-dual is a subtrellis of the local dual, while for
KV-trellises these two coincide. Furthermore, making use of both the
BCJR-construction and the local dualization, it will be shown that for each
complete set of characteristic generators of a code there exists a complete set
of characteristic generators of the dual code such that their resulting
KV-trellises are dual to each other if paired suitably. This proves a stronger
version of a conjecture formulated by Koetter/Vardy.

such gap was found. A gap also appears for a finite bias. Numerical results for

generalization of the classical equations for gravitational field is studied.
The equations match to (i) the weak Newtonian limit on the moderate scales,
(ii) deliver a potential higher, that Newtonian, on certain, large-distance
characteristic scales. The perturbation of the gravitational field results in
the tiny secular perihelion shift and exhibits some unusual effects on large
scales. The general representation of the solution for fractional wave equation
is given in form of retarded potentials. The solutions for the Riesz wave
equation and classical wave equation are clearly distinctive in an important
sense. The Riesz wave demonstrates the space diffusion of gravitational wave at
the scales of metric constant. The diffusion leads to the blur of the peak and
disruption of the sharp wave front. This contrasts with the solution of
D'Alembert classi-cal wave equation, which obeys the Huygens principle and does
not diffuse.

observables of type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), that allow one to standardize their
peak luminosities. However, several issues are yet to be clarified: SNe~Ia show
color variations after the standardization. Also, individual SNe~Ia can show
residuals in their standardized peak absolute magnitude at the level of $\sim
0.15$ mag. In this paper, we explore how the color and luminosity residual are
related to the wavelength shift of nebular emission lines observed at $\gsim
150$ days after maximum light. A sample of 11 SNe Ia which likely suffer from
little host extinction indicates a correlation ($3.3\sigma$) between the peak
$B-V$ color and the late-time emission-line shift. Furthermore, a nearly
identical relation applies for a larger sample in which only three SNe with
$B-V \gsim 0.2$ mag are excluded. Following the interpretation that the
late-time emission-line shift is a tracer of the viewing direction from which
an off-centre explosion is observed, we suggest that the viewing direction is a
dominant factor controlling the SN color and that a large part of the color
variations is intrinsic, rather than due to the host extinction. We also
investigate a relation between the peak luminosity residuals and the wavelength
shift in nebular emission lines in a sample of 20 SNe. We thereby found a hint
of a correlation (at $\sim 1.6 \sigma$ level). The confirmation of this will
require a future sample of SNe with more accurate distance estimates. Radiation
transfer simulations for a toy explosion model where different viewing angles
cause the late-time emission-line shift are presented, predicting a strong
correlation between the color and shift, and a weaker one for the luminosity
residual.

homogeneous elastic medium in form of transition from Euclidean to
Riemann-Cartan internal geometry of medium. The deformation of elastic medium
without defects is based on Euclidean geometry in three dimensional space. The
deformation of elastic medium with defects is based on Riemann-Cartan geometry
and is interpreted in this Article, as different phase state. In this article,
the expression for the free energy leading is equal to a volume integral of the
scalar function (the Lagrangian) that depends on metric and Ricci tensors only.
In the linear elastic isotropic case the elastic potential is a quadratic
function of the first and second invariants of strain and warp tensors with two
Lame, two mixed and two bending constants. The conditions of stability of media
are derived using expressions of free energy in two alternative phases.
Initially the defect-free phase is stable and remains stable, when the strain
is considerably small. With the increasing strain the stability conditions
could be violated. If the strain in material attains the critical value, the
pure geometric instability occurs. In other words, the medium undergoes the
spontaneous symmetry breaking in form of emerging topological defects and
transition to plastic flow.

subgroup of $\mc G$. We show that, under certain mild assumptions, any (normal)

Cohen-Macaulay.
  Examples are the $G\times G$-orbits in normal reductive monoids with unit

well-known determinantal varieties and the varieties of (circular) complexes.

all euclidean isometries, both direct and indirect. We locate the spin group, a
