exists, within a range of the model parameters, analogous to that recently

privacy-preserving data analysis and publishing: What formal privacy guarantee
(if any) does $k$-anonymization provide? How to benefit from the adversary's
uncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a
connection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create
uncertainty. The main result of the paper is that $k$-anonymization, when done
""safely"", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This
result illustrates that ""hiding in a crowd of $k$"" indeed offers some privacy
guarantees. This result also suggests an alternative approach to output
perturbation for satisfying differential privacy: namely, adding a random
sampling step in the beginning and pruning results that are too sensitive to
change of a single tuple. Regarding the second question, we provide both
positive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a
random-sampling pre-processing step to a differentially-private algorithm can
greatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset
resulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the
negative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary's
uncertainty likely does not compose. We discuss what these results imply in
practice.

matter particles. At high energies, the search for such line features in the
cosmic gamma-ray spectrum is essentially background free because plausible
astrophysical processes are not expected to produce such a signal. The
observation of a gamma-ray line would hence be a `smoking-gun' signature for
dark matter, making the search for such signals particularly attractive. Among
the different dark matter models predicting gamma-ray lines, the local
supersymmetric extension of the standard model with small R-parity violation
and gravitino LSP is of particular interest because it provides a framework
where primordial nucleosynthesis, gravitino dark matter and thermal
leptogenesis are naturally consistent. Using the two-years Fermi LAT data, we
present a dedicated search for gamma-ray lines coming from dark matter
annihilation or decay in the Galactic halo. Taking into account the full
detector response, and using a binned profile likelihood method, we search for
significant line features in the energy spectrum of the diffuse flux observed
in different regions of the sky. No evidence for a line signal at the 5-sigma
level is found for photon energies between 1 and 300 GeV, and conservative
bounds on dark matter decay rates and annihilation cross sections are
presented. Implications for gravitino dark matter in presence of small R-parity

for seeing long-lived neutralinos or staus at the LHC.

pruning criterion for probabilistic similarity queries on uncertain data. Our
approach supports a general uncertainty model using continuous probabilistic
density functions to describe the (possibly correlated) uncertain attributes of
objects. In a nutshell, the problem to be solved is to compute the PDF of the
random variable denoted by the probabilistic domination count: Given an
uncertain database object B, an uncertain reference object R and a set D of
uncertain database objects in a multi-dimensional space, the probabilistic
domination count denotes the number of uncertain objects in D that are closer
to R than B. This domination count can be used to answer a wide range of
probabilistic similarity queries. Specifically, we propose a novel geometric
pruning filter and introduce an iterative filter-refinement strategy for
conservatively and progressively estimating the probabilistic domination count
in an efficient way while keeping correctness according to the possible world
semantics. In an experimental evaluation, we show that our proposed technique
allows to acquire tight probability bounds for the probabilistic domination
count quickly, even for large uncertain databases.

over 270 HII regions in NGC 4449. Using this database we have derived
luminosity (L)--volume (V) relations for the regions in the two galaxies,
showing that within the error limits these obey the equation L ~ V^(2/3), which
differs from the linear relation expected for regions of constant uniform
electron density. We discuss briefly possible models which would give rise to
this behavior, notably models with strong density inhomogeneities within the
regions. Plotting the luminosity functions for the two galaxies we find a break
in the slope for M51 at log(L) = 38.5 dex (units in erg s^(-1)) for M51 in good
agreement with the previous ground-based study by Rand, and above this
luminosity NGC 4449 also shows a sharp decline in its luminosity function,
although the number of regions is too small to plot the function well at higher
luminosities. The cumulative diameter distribution for the HII regions of M51
shows dual behaviour, with a break at a radius close to 100 pc, the radius of
regions with the break luminosity. Here too we indicate the possible physical
implications.

(PA = 14{\deg}), forms two peaks at the extremes of this elongated emission

non-circular motions associated both with the 18"" bar-like structure and the
spiral feature detected beyond it. The 1.6 micron H-band 2MASS image of NGC
3627 shows a stellar bar with a PA = -21{\deg}, different from the PA (=
14{\deg}) of the CO bar-like structure, indicating that the gas is leading the
stellar bar. The torques computed with the HST-NICMOS F160W image and our PdBI
maps are negative down to the resolution limit of our images, ~60 pc in
CO(2-1). If the bar ends at ~3 kpc, coincident with corotation (CR), the
torques are negative between the CR of the bar and the nucleus, down to the
resolution limit of our observations. This scenario is compatible with a
recently-formed rapidly rotating bar which has had insufficient time to slow
down because of secular evolution, and thus has not yet formed an inner
Lindblad resonance (ILR). The presence of molecular gas inside the CR of the
primary bar, where we expect that the ILR will form, makes NGC 3627 a potential
smoking gun of inner gas inflow. The gas is fueling the central region, and in
a second step could fuel directly the active nucleus.

analyzed first in the linear case, where comparison to previously proposed
linear-quadratic optimal controllers is made; further, transition thresholds
are evaluated via Direct Numerical Simulations of the controlled

intergalactic magnetic fields is affected by frequency-dependent Faraday
depolarisation. The maximum polarised intensity depends on the physical
properties of the depolarising medium. New-generation radio telescopes like
LOFAR, SKA and its precursors need a wide range of frequencies to cover the
full range of objects. The optimum frequency of maximum polarised intensity
(PI) is computed for the cases of depolarisation in magneto-ionic media by
regular magnetic fields (differential Faraday rotation) or by turbulent
magnetic fields (internal or external Faraday dispersion), assuming that the
Faraday spectrum of the medium is dominated by one component or that the medium
is turbulent. Polarised emission from bright galaxy disks, spiral arms and
cores of galaxy clusters are best observed at wavelengths below a few
centimeters (at frequencies beyond about 10 GHz), halos of galaxies and
clusters around decimeter wavelengths (at frequencies below about 2 GHz).
Intergalactic filaments need observations at meter wavelengths (frequencies
below 300 MHz). Sources with extremely large intrinsic $|RM|$ or RM dispersion
can be searched with mm-wave telescopes. Measurement of the PI spectrum allows
us to derive the average Faraday rotation measure $|RM|$ or the Faraday
dispersion within the source, as demonstrated for the case of the spiral galaxy
NGC 6946. Periodic fluctuations in PI at low frequencies are a signature of
differential Faraday rotation. Internal and external Faraday dispersion can be
distinguished by the different slopes of the PI spectrum at low frequencies. A
wide band around the optimum frequency is important to distinguish between
varieties of depolarisation effects.

of high density gas and its relationship with the presence of young stellar
objects. From the global analysis of our data we find that in general the
highest values of the line width are obtained for the regions with the highest
values of mass and kinetic temperature. We also found a correlation between the
nonthermal line width and the bolometric luminosity of the sources, and between
the mass of the core and the bolometric luminosity. We confirm with a larger
sample of regions the conclusion of Anglada et al. (1997) that the NH3 line
emission is more intense toward molecular outflow sources than toward sources
with optical outflow, suggesting a possible evolutionary scheme in which young
stellar objects associated with molecular outflows progressively lose their
neighboring high-density gas, weakening both the NH3 emission and the molecular
outflow in the process, and making optical jets more easily detectable as the
total amount of gas decreases.

stellar atmosphere with a single one-dimensional average stratification for the
purpose of spectral diagnosis of the atmosphere's average spectrum. In
particular we construct four different one-dimensional stratifications from a
single snapshot of a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of solar convection: one
by averaging its properties over surfaces of constant height, and three
different ones by averaging over surfaces of constant optical depth at 500 nm.
Using these models we calculate continuum, and atomic and molecular line
intensities and their center-to-limb variations. From analysis of the emerging
spectra we identify three main reasons why these average representations are
inadequate for accurate determination of stellar atmospheric properties through
spectroscopic analysis. These reasons are: non-linearity in the Planck function
with temperature, which raises the average emergent intensity of an
inhomogeneous atmosphere above that of an average-property atmosphere, even if
their temperature-optical depth stratification is identical; non-linearities in
molecular formation with temperature and density, which raise the abundance of
molecules of an inhomogeneous atmosphere over that in a one-dimensional model
with the same average properties; the anisotropy of convective motions, which
strongly affects the center-to-limb variation of line-core intensities. We
argue therefore that a one-dimensional atmospheric model that reproduces the

columns. We show that under certain technical assumptions, the normalized
eigenvalue counting measure of $T_n$ for $n\to\infty$ weakly converges to one
component of the unique vector of measures that minimizes a certain energy
functional. In this way we generalize a recent result of Duits and Kuijlaars
for the scalar case. Along the way we also obtain an equilibrium problem
associated to an arbitrary algebraic curve, not necessarily related to a block
Toeplitz matrix.
  For banded block Toeplitz matrices, there are several new phenomena that do
not occur in the scalar case: (i) The total masses of the equilibrium measures
do not necessarily form a simple arithmetic series but in general are obtained
through a combinatorial rule; (ii) The limiting eigenvalue distribution may
contain point masses, and there may be attracting point sources in the
equilibrium problem; (iii) More seriously, there are examples where the
connection between the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $T_n$ and the
solution to the equilibrium problem breaks down. We provide sufficient
conditions guaranteeing that no such breakdown occurs; in particular we show
this if $T_n$ is a Hessenberg matrix.

Simulations) project, an open source software project to develop libraries and
application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice
models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly correlated fermion
systems. The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats,
libraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and
plotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to
start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic
implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models:
classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended
ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a dynamic
time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful
framework for programers to develop their own applications, which, for
instance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel,
distributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of
HDF5 for binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows
operating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation
packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow
provenance tool. The software is available from our web server at

formation in the dynamic environment of giant molecular clouds, focusing on

to test how core evolution and properties depend on the velocity dispersion in
the parent cloud; our simulation suite consists of 180 models with inflow Mach
numbers Ma=v/c_s=1.1-9. At all Mach numbers, our models show that turbulence
and self-gravity collect gas within post-shock regions into filaments at the
same time as overdense areas within these filaments condense into cores. This
morphology, together with the subsonic velocities we find inside cores, is
similar to observations. We extend previous results showing that core collapse
develops in an ``outside-in'' manner, with density and velocity approaching the
Larson-Penston asymptotic solution. The time for the first core to collapse
varies as 1/sqrt(v), consistent with analytic estimates. Core building takes 10
times as long as core collapse, consistent with observed prestellar core
lifetimes. Core shapes change from oblate to prolate as they evolve. To define
cores, we use isosurfaces of the gravitational potential. We compare to cores
defined using the potential computed from projected surface density, finding
good agreement for core masses and sizes; this offers a new way to identify
cores in observed maps. Cores with masses varying by three orders of magnitude
(0.05 - 50 M_sun) are identified in our simulations. Stability analysis of
post-shock layers predicts that the first core to collapse will have mass M
\propto v^-1/2, and that the minimum mass for cores formed at late times will
have M\propto v^-1. From our simulations, the median mass lies between these
two relations.

the heart of statistical mechanics. The maximum entropy principle put forward
in 1957 by E. T. Jaynes suggests what quantum states one should expect in
equilibrium but does not hint as to how closed quantum many-body systems
dynamically equilibrate. A number of theoretical and numerical studies
accumulate evidence that under specific conditions quantum many-body models can
relax to a situation that locally or with respect to certain observables
appears as if the entire system had relaxed to a maximum entropy state. In this
work, we report the experimental observation of the non-equilibrium dynamics of
a density wave of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice in the regime
of strong correlations. Using an optical superlattice, we are able to prepare
the system in a well-known initial state with high fidelity. We then follow the
dynamical evolution of the system in terms of quasi-local densities, currents,
and coherences. Numerical studies based on the time-dependent density-matrix
renormalization group method are in an excellent quantitative agreement with
the experimental data. For very long times, all three local observables show a
fast relaxation to equilibrium values compatible with those expected for a
global maximum entropy state. We find this relaxation of the quasi-local
densities and currents to initially follow a power-law with an exponent being
significantly larger than for free or hardcore bosons. For intermediate times
the system fulfills the promise of being a dynamical quantum simulator, in that
the controlled dynamics runs for longer times than present classical algorithms
based on matrix product states can efficiently keep track of.

as soon as they are endowed a Wilsonian weakly-coupled UV-completion that
restores perturbative unitarity, despite the fact that such UV-completion does
not change the leading structure of the effective low-energy theory. For
example, a Chiral Lagrangian of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pions), with or without
the Higgs (QCD) UV-completion looks the same in zero momentum limit, but the
latter classicalizes in high energy scattering, whereas the former does not.
Thus, theory must make a definite choice, either accept a weakly-coupled
UV-completion or be classicalized. The UV-awareness that determines the choice
is encoded in sub-leading structure of effective low-energy action. This
peculiarity has to do with the fundamental fact that in classicalizing theories
high energies correspond to large distances, due to existence of the extended
classical configurations sourced by energy. UV-fate of the theory can be
parameterized by introducing a concept of a new quantum length-scale,
de-classicalization radius. Classicalization is abolished when this radius is a
dominant length. We then observe a possibility of a qualitatively new regime,
in which a theory classicalizes only within a finite window of energies. We
suggest that one possible interpretation of physics above the classicality
window is in terms of a quantum theory of unstable extended objects, analogous,
for example, to unstable QCD-type flux tubes. In this picture ordinary QCD can
be viewed as a would-be classicalizing theory with collapsed classicality
window.

latest information from nuclear databases and a detailed error budget. The
first part of this work is the so-called ab initio approach where the total
antineutrino spectrum is built from the sum of all beta-branches of all fission
products predicted by an evolution code. Systematic effects and missing
information in nuclear databases lead to final relative uncertainties in the 10
to 20% range. A prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the
fission of 238U is given based on this ab initio method. For the dominant
isotopes 235U and 239Pu, we developed a more accurate approach combining
information from nuclear databases and reference electron spectra associated
with the fission of 235U, 239Pu and 241Pu, measured at ILL in the 80's. We show
how the anchor point of the measured total beta-spectra can be used to suppress
the uncertainty in nuclear databases while taking advantage of all the
information they contain. We provide new reference antineutrino spectra for
235U, 239Pu and 241Pu isotopes in the 2-8 MeV range. While the shapes of the
spectra and their uncertainties are comparable to that of the previous analysis
of the ILL data, the normalization is shifted by about +3% on average. In the
perspective of the re-analysis of past experiments and direct use of these
results by upcoming oscillation experiments, we discuss the various sources of

relativistic differentially-rotating neutron stars in axisymmetry. The maximum
allowed mass for each model is strongly affected by the distribution of angular
velocity along the radial direction and by the consequent degree of
differential rotation. In order to study the wide parameter space implied by
the choice of rotation law, we introduce a functional form that generalizes the
so called ""j-const. law"" adopted in all previous work. Using this new rotation
law we reproduce the angular velocity profile of differentially-rotating
remnants from the coalescence of binary neutron stars in various 3-dimensional
dynamical simulations. We compute equilibrium sequences of differentially
rotating stars with a polytropic equation of state starting from the
spherically symmetric static case. By analyzing the sequences at constant
ratio, T/|W|, of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational binding energy, we
find that the parameters that best describe the binary neutron star remnants
cannot produce equilibrium configurations with values of T/|W| that exceed
0.14, the criterion for the onset of the secular instability.

method to evaluate the efficiency for pre-forming molecules, the entropy per
particle and the thermal fluctuations. We show that within the strong
interaction regime (and at high temperature), the strong-coupling expansion is
an economical way to study this problem. In some cases, it remains valid even
down to low temperatures. Because the computational effort is minimal, the
strong-coupling approach allows us to work with much larger system sizes, where
boundary effects can be eliminated, which is particularly important at higher
temperatures. Since the strong-coupling approach is so efficient and accurate,
it allows one to rapidly scan through parameter space in order to optimize the
pre-forming of molecules on a lattice (by choosing the lattice depth and
interspecies attraction). Based on the strong-coupling calculations, we test
the thermometry scheme based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and find
the scheme gives accurate temperature estimation even at very low temperature.
We believe this approach and the calculation results will be useful in the
design of the next generation of experiments, and will hopefully lead to the
ability to form dipolar matter in the quantum degenerate regime.

We determine an absolute reference for line-of-sight velocities measured from
solar observations for any heliocentric angle, calibrating the convective line
shift of spatially-averaged profiles on quiet sun from a 3D hydrodynamical
simulation. This method works whenever there is quiet sun in the field-of-view,
and it has the advantage of being relatively insensitive to uncertainties in
the atomic data. We carry out radiative transfer computations in LTE for
selected C I and Fe I lines, whereas the Ca II infrared lines are synthesized
in non-LTE. The degree of asymmetry and the line shifts, however, show a clear
dependence on the heliocentric angle and the properties of the lines. The
profiles at \mu = 1 are compared with observed profiles to prove their
reliability, and they are tested against errors induced by the LTE
calculations, inaccuracies in the atomic data and the 3D simulation.
Theoretical quiet-sun profiles of lines commonly used by solar observers are
provided to the community. Those can be used as absolute references for
line-of-sight velocities. The limb effect is produced by the projection of the

in C. elegans with random spatial network growth highlight two findings
relevant to neural network development. First, most neurons which are linked by
long-distance connections are born around the same time and early on,
suggesting the possibility of early contact or interaction between connected
neurons during development. Second, early-born neurons are more highly
connected (tendency to form hubs) than later born neurons. This indicates that
the longer time frame available to them might underlie high connectivity. Both
outcomes are not observed for random connection formation. The study finds that
around one-third of electrically coupled long-range connections are late
forming, raising the question of what mechanisms are involved in ensuring their
accuracy, particularly in light of the extremely invariant connectivity
observed in C. elegans. In conclusion, the sequence of neural network
development highlights the possibility of early contact or interaction in
securing long-distance and high-degree connectivity.

radio galaxy NGC 1275, based on two years of observations with the Fermi-LAT
detector. Previous Fermi studies of NGC 1275 had found evidence for spectral
and flux variability on monthly timescales during the first year of Fermi-LAT
observations. This variability is also seen in the larger two year data set,
during which we observe a large $\gamma-$ray flare (June-August 2010). The
increased photon statistics from this large flare have allowed the discovery of
flux variability from NGC 1275 on the timescales of days. The largest flux
variation observed during this flare being a factor of $\sim 3$ from one day to
the next and a resultant $e$-folding risetime of $1.51\pm0.2$ days. The two
year averaged $E>$100 MeV $\gamma-$ray spectrum is adequately described by a
power-law spectrum, with a photon index, $\Gamma$, of $2.09 \pm 0.02$, and a
resultant integrated flux of $F_{\gamma}=(2.2\pm0.1) \times 10^{-7}$ ph
cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. While no hysteresis was observed in the photon index$-$flux
($\Gamma_{\gamma}$ vs F$_{\gamma}$) parameter space, there was obvious
`harder-when-brighter' behaviour observed during the large $\gamma-$ray flare.
Furthermore, during this large flare, NGC 1275 appeared to migrate from the FR
I radio galaxy to the BL Lac object region of the photon index$-$luminosity
($\Gamma_{\gamma}$ vs L$_{\gamma}$) paramater space. In this paper we present
details of our Fermi-LAT analysis of NGC 1275, including a brief discussion on
its implications for $\gamma-$ray blazar sources.

the decoupling of high-energy and low-energy physics. However this generator

lead to spurious deep bound states. We would like the SRG to decouple these
from the physical shallow bound states. However, with $\Trel$ the high- and
low-energy bound states are not decoupled in the usual sense. Replacing $\Trel$
by the momentum-space diagonal of the Hamiltonian ($H_d$) in the SRG generator

space, particularly in the theoretically well-motivated region where the axion
decay constant f_a lies near the GUT and Planck scales. We suggest a novel
experimental method to search for QCD axion dark matter in this region. The
axion field oscillates at a frequency equal to its mass when it is a component
of dark matter. These oscillations induce time varying CP-odd nuclear moments,
such as electric dipole and Schiff moments. The coupling between internal
atomic fields and these nuclear moments gives rise to time varying shifts to
atomic energy levels. These effects can be enhanced by using elements with
large Schiff moments such as the light Actinides, and states with large
spontaneous parity violation, such as molecules in a background electric field.
The energy level shift in such a molecule can be ~ 10^-24 eV or larger. While
challenging, this energy shift may be observable in a molecular clock
configuration with technology presently under development. The detectability of
this energy shift is enhanced by the fact that it is a time varying shift whose
oscillation frequency is set by fundamental physics and is therefore
independent of the details of the experiment. This signal is most easily
observed in the sub-MHz range, allowing detection when f_a is > 10^16 GeV, and
possibly as low as 10^15 GeV. A discovery in such an experiment would not only
reveal the nature of dark matter and confirm the axion as the solution to the
strong CP problem, it would also provide a glimpse of physics at the highest
energy scales, far beyond what can be directly probed in the laboratory.

critical services being provided over the Internet. This has made it imperative
to monitor the network traffic so as to prevent malicious attackers from
depleting the resources of the network and denying services to legitimate
users. This paper has presented a mechanism for protecting a web-server against
a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Incoming traffic to the server
is continuously monitored and any abnormal rise in the inbound traffic is
immediately detected. The detection algorithm is based on a statistical
analysis of the inbound traffic on the server and a robust hypothesis testing
framework. While the detection process is on, the sessions from the legitimate
sources are not disrupted and the load on the server is restored to the normal
level by blocking the traffic from the attacking sources. To cater to different
scenarios, the detection algorithm has various modules with varying level of
computational and memory overheads for their execution. While the approximate
modules are fast in detection and involve less overhead, they have lower
detection accuracy. The accurate modules involve complex detection logic and
hence involve more overhead for their execution, but they have very high
detection accuracy. Simulations carried out on the proposed mechanism have
produced results that demonstrate effectiveness of the scheme.

multichromophoric system from a sequence of two-dimensional electronic spectra

tractable model system: a coupled dimer. After exhaustively enumerating the
Liouville pathways associated to each peak in the 2D-ES, we argue that by
judiciously combining the information from a series of experiments varying the
polarization and frequency components of the pulses, detailed information at
the amplitude level about the input and output quantum states at the waiting
time can be obtained. This possibility yields a quantum process tomography
(QPT) of the single-exciton manifold, which completely characterizes the open
quantum system dynamics through the reconstruction of the process matrix. This
is the first of a series of two articles. In this manuscript, we specialize our
results to the case of a homodimer, where we prove that signals stemming from
coherence to population transfer and viceversa vanish upon isotropic averaging,
and therefore, only a partial QPT is possible in this case. However, this fact
simplifies the spectra, and it follows that only two polarization controlled
experiments (and no pulse-shaping requirements) suffice to yield the elements
of the process matrix which survive under isotropic averaging. The angle
between the two site transition dipole moments is self-consistently obtained
from the 2D-ES. Model calculations are presented, as well as an error analysis
in terms of the angle between the dipoles and peak overlap. In the second
article accompanying this study, we numerically exemplify the theory for
heterodimers and carry out a detailed error analysis for such case. This
investigation provides an important benchmark for more complex proposals of

technique of step frequency (SF) to compressive sensing (CS) based multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) radar. The proposed approach enables high resolution range,
angle and Doppler estimation, while transmitting narrowband pulses. The problem
of joint angle-Doppler-range estimation is first formulated to fit the CS
framework, i.e., as an L1 optimization problem. Direct solution of this problem
entails high complexity as it employs a basis matrix whose construction
requires discretization of the angle-Doppler-range space. Since high resolution
requires fine space discretization, the complexity of joint range, angle and
Doppler estimation can be prohibitively high. For the case of slowly moving
targets, a technique is proposed that achieves significant complexity reduction
by successively estimating angle-range and Doppler in a decoupled fashion and
by employing initial estimates obtained via matched filtering to further reduce
the space that needs to be digitized. Numerical results show that the
combination of CS and SF results in a MIMO radar system that has superior
resolution and requires far less data as compared to a system that uses a
matched filter with SF.

great importance in understanding the birth and evolution of the Universe. One
of the difficulties in CMB experiments is the domination of measured CMB
anisotropy maps by the Doppler dipole moment from the motion of the antenna
relative to the CMB. For each measured temperature the expected dipole
component has to be calculated separately and then subtracted from the data. A
small error in dipole direction, antenna pointing direction, sidelobe pickup
contamination, and/or timing synchronism, can raise significant deviation in
the dipole cleaned CMB temperature. After a full-sky observational scan, the
accumulated deviations will be structured with a pattern closely correlated to
the observation pattern with artificial anisotropies on large scales, including
artificial quadrupole, octopole etc in the final CMB map. Such scan-induced
anisotropies on large scales can be predicted by the true dipole moment and
observational scan scheme. Indeed, the expected scan-induced quadrupole pattern
of the WMAP mission is perfectly in agreement with the published WMAP
quadrupole. With the scan strategy of the Planck mission, we predict that
scan-induced anisotropies will also produce an artificially aligned quadrupole.
The scan-induced anisotropy is a common problem for all sweep missions and,
like the foreground emissions, has to be removed from observed maps. Without
doing so, CMB maps from COBE, WMAP, and Planck as well, are not reliable for
studying the CMB anisotropy.

rate splitting approach in which non-shared data (private to each transmitter)
and shared data are superposed. We derive the corresponding achievable rate
region and obtain the optimal beamforming design for both shared and private

investigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the
side information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of
erroneous symbols $\delta$, what is the shortest length of a linear index code,
such that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This
question turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a
shortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting
capability in the classical coding theory. The Singleton bound and two other
bounds, referred to as the $\alpha$-bound and the $\kappa$-bound, for the
optimal length of a linear error-correcting index code (ECIC) are established.
For large alphabets, a construction based on concatenation of an optimal index
code with an MDS classical code, is shown to attain the Singleton bound. For
smaller alphabets, however, this construction may not be optimal. A random
construction is also analyzed. It yields another inexplicit bound on the length
of an optimal linear ECIC. Finally, the decoding of linear ECIC's is discussed.
The syndrome decoding is shown to output the exact message if the weight of the

238U(18O,16O)240U around 10 MeV per nucleon are calculated by one-step
Born-approximation with a 16O+2n+238U three-body model. The three-body wave
function in the initial channel is obtained with the continuum-discretized
coupled-channels method, and that in the final channel is evaluated with
adiabatic approximation. The resulting cross sections have a peak around the
grazing angle, and the spin distribution, i.e., the cross section at the peak
as a function of the transferred spin, is investigated. The shape of the spin
distribution is found not sensitive to the incident energies, optical
potentials, and treatment of the breakup channels both in the initial and final
states, while it depends on the excitation energy of the residual nucleus 240U.
The peak of the spin distribution moves to the large-spin direction as the
excitation energy increases. To fulfill the condition that the peak position
should not exceeds 10 hbar, which is necessary for the surrogate ratio method
to work, it is concluded that the excitation energy of 240U must be less than
10 MeV.

generation wireless broadband networks showing rapid progress and inspiring
numerous compelling applications. A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers
(MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone
through the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and
communicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the
involvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in
WMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium,
stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to
support real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust,
reliable and efficient routing protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end
latency. Design of a secure and efficient routing protocol for WMNs, therefore,
is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable
routing protocol that also provides user anonymity in WMNs. The protocol is
based on an accurate estimation of the available bandwidth in the wireless
links and a robust estimation of the end-to-end delay in a routing path, and
minimization of control message overhead. The user anonymity, authentication
and data privacy is achieved by application of a novel protocol that is based
on Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulations carried out on the proposed
protocol demonstrate that it is more efficient than some of the existing
routing protocols.

241Pu and 238U, increasing the mean flux by about 3 percent. To good
approximation, this reevaluation applies to all reactor neutrino experiments.
The synthesis of published experiments at reactor-detector distances <100 m
leads to a ratio of observed event rate to predicted rate of 0.976(0.024). With
our new flux evaluation, this ratio shifts to 0.943(0.023), leading to a
deviation from unity at 98.6% C.L. which we call the reactor antineutrino
anomaly. The compatibility of our results with the existence of a fourth
non-standard neutrino state driving neutrino oscillations at short distances is
discussed. The combined analysis of reactor data, gallium solar neutrino
calibration experiments, and MiniBooNE-neutrino data disfavors the
no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8% C.L. The oscillation parameters are such
that |Delta m_{new}^2|>1.5 eV^2 (95%) and sin^2(2\theta_{new})=0.14(0.08)
(95%). Constraints on the theta13 neutrino mixing angle are revised.

group of the discrete group $G_d$. We show that a dense subgroup $H$ of $X$ is
$\mathfrak{g}$-closed iff $H$ algebraically is the dual group of $G$ endowed
with some maximally almost periodic $s$-topology. Every reflexive Polish
Abelian group is $\mathfrak{g}$-closed in its Bohr compactification. If a
$s$-topology $\tau$ on a countably infinite Abelian group $G$ is generated by a
countable set of convergent sequences, then the dual group of $(G,\tau)$ is
Polish. A non-trivial Hausdorff Abelian topological group is a $s$-group iff it
is a quotient group of the $s$-sum of a family of copies of

scale structure around the z=1.82 QSO RXJ0941, which shows an overdensity of
submm sources. Radio imaging confirms the presence of the submm sources and
pinpoints their likely optical-NIR counterparts. Four of the five submm sources
present in this field (including the QSO) have counterparts with redshifts
compatible with z=1.82. We show that our photometric redshifts are robust
against the use of different spectral templates. We have measured the galaxy
stellar mass of the submm galaxies from their rest-frame K-band luminosity
obtaining log(M*/Msun)~11.5+-0.2, slightly larger than the Schechter mass of
present day galaxies, and hence indicating that most of the stellar mass is
already formed. We present optical-to-radio spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of the five SCUBA sources. The emission of RXJ0941 is dominated by
reprocessed AGN emission in the observed MIR range, while the starburst
contribution completely dominates in the submm range. The SEDs of the other
three counterparts are compatible with a dominant starburst contribution above
~24um, with star formation rates SFR~2000Msun/yr, central dust masses
log(Mdust/Msun)~9+-0.5 and hence central gas masses log(Mgas/Msun)~10.7. There
is very little room for an AGN contribution. From X-ray upper limits and the
observed 24um flux, we derive a maximum 2-10keV X-ray luminosity of 1e44 erg/s
for any putative AGN, even if they are heavily obscured. This in turn points to
relatively small black holes with log(MBH/Msun)<~8 and hence stellar-to-black
hole mass ratios about one order of magnitude higher than those observed in the
present Universe: most of their central black hole masses are still to be
accreted. Local stellar-to-black hole masses ratios can be reached if ~1.3% of
the available nuclear gas mass is accreted.

in wireless and mobile computing research. Applications of WSNs are numerous
and growing, and range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office
to outdoor deployment scenarios in adversary's territory in a tactical
battleground (Akyildiz et al., 2002). For military environment, dispersal of
WSNs into an adversary's territory enables the detection and tracking of enemy
soldiers and vehicles. For home/office environments, indoor sensor networks
offer the ability to monitor the health of the elderly and to detect intruders
via a wireless home security system. In each of these scenarios, lives and
livelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of the sensor data
obtained from dispersed sensor nodes. As a result, such WSNs must be secured to
prevent an intruder from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and
from forging sensor data. To address the latter problem, end-to-end data
integrity checksums and post-processing of senor data can be used to identify
forged sensor data (Estrin et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2003a; Ye et al., 2004).
The focus of this chapter is on routing security in WSNs. Most of the currently
existing routing protocols for WSNs make an optimization on the limited
capabilities of the nodes and the application-specific nature of the network,
but do not any the security aspects of the protocols. Although these protocols
have not been designed with security as a goal, it is extremely important to
analyze their security properties. When the defender has the liabilities of
insecure wireless communication, limited node capabilities, and possible
insider threats, and the adversaries can use powerful laptops with high energy
and long range communication to attack the network, designing a secure routing
protocol for WSNs is obviously a non-trivial task.

or, essentially equivalently, (large) Lawvere theories are a well-established
tool for modelling generic side-effects. An important issue in this context are
combination mechanisms for such algebraic effects, which allow for the modular
design of programming languages and verification logics. The most basic
combination operators are sum and tensor: while the sum of effects is just
their non-interacting union, the tensor imposes commutation of effects.
However, for effects with unbounded arity, such as continuations or unbounded
nondeterminism, it is not a priori clear whether these combinations actually
exist in all cases. Here, we introduce the class of uniform effects, which
includes unbounded nondeterminism and continuations, and prove that the tensor
does always exist if one of the component effects is uniform, thus in
particular improving on previous results on tensoring with continuations. We
then treat the case of nondeterminism in more detail, and give an
order-theoretic characterization of effects for which tensoring with
nondeterminism is conservative, thus enabling nondeterministic arguments such
as a generic version of the Fischer-Ladner encoding of control operators.

of motion of a test body in the gravitational field of a rotating axisymmetric
massive body, using the parametrized framework of Mao, Tegmark, Guth and Cabi.
We calculate the secular variations of the longitudes of the node and of the
pericenter. We also show how the LAser GEOdynamics Satellites (LAGEOS) can be
used to constrain torsion parameters. We report the experimental constraints
obtained using both the nodes and perigee measurements of the orbital
Lense-Thirring effect. This makes LAGEOS and Gravity Probe B (GPB)
complementary frame-dragging and torsion experiments, since they constrain
three different combinations of torsion parameters.

validity of certain results in category theory and homotopy theory which were
known to follow from Vopenka's principle. We prove that the necessary
large-cardinal hypotheses depend on the complexity of the formulas defining the
given classes, in the sense of the Levy hierarchy. For example, the statement
that, for a class S of morphisms in a locally presentable category C of
structures, the orthogonal class of objects is a small-orthogonality class
(hence reflective) is provable in ZFC if S is \Sigma_1, while it follows from
the existence of a proper class of supercompact cardinals if S is \Sigma_2, and
from the existence of a proper class of what we call C(n)-extendible cardinals
if S is \Sigma_{n+2} for n bigger than or equal to 1. These cardinals form a
new hierarchy, and we show that Vopenka's principle is equivalent to the
existence of C(n)-extendible cardinals for all n. As a consequence, we prove
that the existence of cohomological localizations of simplicial sets, a
long-standing open problem in algebraic topology, is implied by the existence
of arbitrarily large supercompact cardinals. This result follows from the fact
that cohomology equivalences are \Sigma_2. In contrast with this fact, homology
equivalences are \Sigma_1, from which it follows (as is well known) that the
existence of homological localizations is provable in ZFC.

twelve dimensions of M-theory on Anti de Sitter spaces, ten-dimensional
heterotic string theory in relation to twelve dimensions, and the two M-branes
within M-theory in the presence of a boundary. The M2-brane is taken with (or
as) a boundary and the worldvolume of the M5-brane is viewed as a tubular
neighborhood. We then concentrate on (variant) of the heterotic theory as a
corner and explore analytical and geometric consequences. In particular, we
formulate and study the phase of the partition function in this setting and
identify the corrections due to the corner(s). The analysis involves
considering M-theory on disconnected manifolds, and makes use of the extension
of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to manifolds with corners and the

reconcile the apparent robustness of most of the deep linguistic structures we
use with the evidence that they undergo possibly slow, yet ceaseless, changes.
Is the state in which we observe languages today closer to what would be a
dynamical attractor with statistically stationary properties or rather closer
to a non-steady state slowly evolving in time? Here we address this question in
the framework of the emergence of shared linguistic categories in a population
of individuals interacting through language games. The observed emerging
asymptotic categorization, which has been previously tested - with success -
against experimental data from human languages, corresponds to a metastable
state where global shifts are always possible but progressively more unlikely
and the response properties depend on the age of the system. This aging
mechanism exhibits striking quantitative analogies to what is observed in the
statistical mechanics of glassy systems. We argue that this can be a general
scenario in language dynamics where shared linguistic conventions would not
emerge as attractors, but rather as metastable states.

determine radial profiles for several elements and using population synthesis

the distribution of metals show a lot of inhomogeneities. Using metal maps
usually gives a metal mass 10-30% higher than the metal mass computed using a
single extraction region, hence it is expected that most previous metal mass
determination have underestimated metal mass. The abundance ratio of

compute this inductive invariant precisely. For that we extend the strategy
improvement algorithm of [Gawlitza and Seidl, 2007]. If we applied their method
directly, we would have to solve an exponentially sized system of abstract
semantic equations, resulting in memory exhaustion. Instead, we keep the system
implicit and discover strategy improvements using SAT modulo real linear
arithmetic (SMT). For evaluating strategies we use linear programming. Our
algorithm has low polynomial space complexity and performs for contrived
examples in the worst case exponentially many strategy improvement steps; this
is unsurprising, since we show that the associated abstract reachability

planets and brown dwarfs, due to tidal forces and rotation, on the observed
transit depth. Such a departure from sphericity leads to a bias in the
derivation of the transit radius from the light curve and affects the
comparison with planet structure and evolution models which assume spherical
symmetry. As the tidally deformed planet projects its smallest cross section
area during the transit, the measured effective radius is smaller than the one
of the unperturbed spherical planet. This effect can be corrected by
calculating the theoretical shape of the observed planet.
  We derive simple analytical expressions for the ellipsoidal shape of a fluid
object (star or planet) accounting for both tidal and rotational deformations
and calibratre it with fully numerical evolution models in the 0.3Mjup-75Mjup
mass range. Our calculations yield a 20% effect on the transit depth, i.e. a
10% decrease of the measured radius, for the extreme case of a 1Mjup planet
orbiting a Sun-like star at 0.01AU. For the closest planets detected so far (<
0.05 AU), the effect on the radius is of the order of 1 to 10%, by no means a
negligible effect, enhancing the puzzling problem of the anomalously large
bloated planets. These corrections must thus be taken into account for a
correct determination of the radius from the transit light curve.
  Our analytical expressions can be easily used to calculate these corrections,
due to the non-spherical shape of the planet, on the observed transit depth and
thus to derive the planet's real equilibrium radius. They can also be used to
model ellipsoidal variations of the stellar flux now detected in the CoRoT and
Kepler light curves. We also derive directly usable analytical expressions for
the moment of inertia, oblateness and Love number (k_2) of a fluid planet as a
function of its mass.

analysis with a well-developed theory for functions. Despite recent work on
implementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of
formally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been
adequately addressed. This paper presents the first results towards automated
verification of source code for differentially private interactive systems. We
develop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for
systems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. The main
technical result of the paper is a sound proof technique based on a form of
probabilistic bisimulation relation for proving that a system modeled as a
probabilistic automaton satisfies differential privacy. The novelty lies in the
way we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family
instead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a
representative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is
intended to provide differential privacy. To make our proof technique easier to
apply to realistic systems, we prove a form of refinement theorem and apply it
to show that a refinement of the abstract PINQ automaton also satisfies our
differential privacy definition. Finally, we begin the process of automating
our proof technique by providing an algorithm for mechanically checking a

requires all galaxies in the Local Group to have non-radial motions with

the measured time lags T_ob of gamma-ray emission relative to broad emission
lines. The method is also applicable to lower frequencies. R_g depends on
parameters T_ob, R_BLR, v_d and theta, where R_BLR is the size of broad-line
region, v_d is the travelling speed of disturbances down the jet and theta is
the viewing angle of the jet axis to the line of sight. As T_ob=0, T_ob<0 or
T_ob>0, the broad lines zero-lag, lag or lead the gamma-rays, respectively. It
is applied to 3C 273, in which the lines and the radio emission have enough
data, but the gamma-rays have not. We find T_ob<0 and T_ob>0 for the 5, 8, 15,
22 and 37 GHz emission relative to the broad lines Ha, Hb and Hg. The lag may
be positive or negative, however current data do not allow to discriminate
between the two cases. The measured lags are on the order of years. For a given
line, T_ob generally decreases as radio frequency increases. This trend most
likely results from the radiative cooling of relativistic electrons. The
negative lags have an average of T_ob=-2.86 years for the 37 GHz emission,
which represents that the lines lag the radio emission. The positive lags have
T_ob=3.20 years, which represents that the lines lead the radio emission. We
obtain the radio emitting positions R_radio=0.40--2.62 pc and
R_radio=9.43--62.31 pc for the negative and positive lags, respectively. From
the constraint of R_g </~ R_radio (e.g. Dermer & Schlickeiser 1994; Jorstad et
al. 2001), we have R_g </~ 0.40--2.62 pc for the negative lags. For the
positive lags, 4.67--30.81<R_g </~ 9.43--62.31 pc. These estimated R_g are
consistent with those of other researches. These agreements confirm the
reliability of the method and assumptions. The method may be also applicable to
BL Lacertae objects, in which broad lines were detected.

analyzed in detail. In glycerol, the short-time mean-square displacement <u^2>,
a measure of the caged dynamics, is contributed by free-volume. It is seen
that, in order to evidence the scaling, the observation time of the fast
dynamics must be shorter than the time scales of the relaxation processes.
Systems with both negligible (like CKN, glycerol and network glassformers) and
high (like van der Waals liquids and polymers) pressure-energy correlations
exhibit the scaling between the slow relaxation and the fast caged dynamics.

for the transformation of the 1-st order deconfinement phase transition into

of surface tension coefficient of large/heavy QGP bags. Using the novel model
of the confinement phenomenon I argue that the physical reason for the
cross-over appearance at low baryonic densities is the negative value of QGP
bag surface tension coefficient. This implies the existence of highly
non-spherical or, probably, even fractal surfaces of large and heavy bags at
and above the cross-over, which, perhaps, can be observed via some
correlations. The model with the tricritical endpoint predicts that at the
deconfinement transition line the volume (mass) distribution of large (heavy)
QGP bags acquires the power law form at the endpoint only, while in the model
with the critical endpoint such a power law exists inside the mixed phase. The
role of finite width of QGP bags is also discussed.

addition, the existence of water maser PNe allow us to study every phase in the
AGB to PN transition using water maser emission which can be observed at very

water maser emission in PNe, the existing observations of the three water maser

correlation, such as in the heavy fermion materials, is believed to arise from
the scattering of the itinerant electrons with low energy spin fluctuations. In
systems with magnetic impurities this scattering leads to the Kondo effect and
a low energy renormalized energy scale, the Kondo temperature $T_{\rm K}$. It
has been generally assumed that these low energy scales can only be accessed by
a non-perturbative approach due to the strength of the local inter-electron
interactions. Here we show that it is possible to circumvent this difficulty by
first suppressing the spin fluctuations with a large magnetic field. As a first
step field-dependent renormalized parameters are calculated using standard
perturbation theory. A renormalized perturbation theory is then used to
calculate the renormalized parameters for a reduced magnetic field strength.
The process can be repeated and the flow of the renormalized parameters
continued to zero magnetic field. We illustrate the viability of this approach
for the single impurity Anderson model. The results for the renormalized
parameters, which flow as a function of magnetic field, can be checked with
those from numerical renormalization group and Bethe ansatz calculations.

aims to provide a generally covariant ultraviolet completion of general

derivatives of the gravitational fields up to fourth order. Some ways to reduce
the order of these time derivatives are considered. The resulting action is
analyzed using the Hamiltonian formalism, which was originally adapted for
constrained theories by Dirac. It is shown that the theory has a consistent set
of constraints. It is, however, found that the theory exhibits four propagating
physical degrees of freedom. This is one degree of freedom more than in
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity and two more propagating modes than in general
relativity. One extra physical degree of freedom has its origin in the higher
order nature of the CRG action. The other extra propagating mode is a
consequence of a projectability condition similarly as in HL gravity. Some
additional gauge symmetry may need to be introduced in order to get rid of the
extra gravitational degrees of freedom.
