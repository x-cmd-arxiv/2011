non-ergodic 'centrifuge' effect. In the limit of St to infinity and Ku to zero
(so that Ku^2 St remains finite) it explains clustering in terms of ergodic
'multiplicative amplification'. In this limit, the theory is consistent with
the asymptotic perturbation series in [Duncan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95

mechanisms compete at finite values of St and Ku. For particles suspended in
two-dimensional random Gaussian incompressible flows, the theory yields
excellent results for Ku < 0.2 for arbitrary values of St; the ergodic
mechanism is found to contribute significantly unless St is very small. For
higher values of Ku the new series is likely to require resummation. But
numerical simulations show that for Ku ~ St ~ 1 too, ergodic 'multiplicative

  The SZA 30-GHz receiver system probes angular scales ~1-5'. A model that can
accurately describe a cluster's pressure profile over a correspondingly broad
range of radii is therefore required. In the analysis presented here, I fit a
2-parameter, radial pressure profile, derived from simulations and detailed X-
ray analysis of relaxed clusters, to SZA observations of three clusters with
exceptionally high quality X-ray data. From the joint analysis of the SZE and
X-ray data, I derive physical properties of the cluster, such as gas and total
mass, gas fraction and the integrated Compton y -parameter.
  The parameters derived from the joint fit to SZE+X-ray data agree well with a
detailed, independent, X-ray-only analysis of these same clusters. When
combined with X-ray imaging data, this new pressure profile yields an
independent estimate of the electron temperature profile that is in good
agreement with spectroscopic X-ray determinations. In addition to yielding
relationships between cluster observables and physical cluster properties, this
model could prove to be a useful tool in helping to constrain the temperatures
of high redshift clusters, for which X-ray spectroscopic data are difficult to

network resulting from continuous movement of sensors. As sensors move around,
initially uncovered locations are likely to be covered at a later time. A
larger area is covered as time continues, and intruders that might never be
detected in a stationary sensor network can now be detected by moving sensors.
However, this improvement in coverage is achieved at the cost that a location
is covered only part of the time, alternating between covered and not covered.
We characterize area coverage at specific time instants and during time
intervals, as well as the time durations that a location is covered and
uncovered. We further characterize the time it takes to detect a randomly
located intruder. For mobile intruders, we take a game theoretic approach and
derive optimal mobility strategies for both sensors and intruders. Our results
show that sensor mobility brings about unique dynamic coverage properties not
present in a stationary sensor network, and that mobility can be exploited to
compensate for the lack of sensors to improve coverage.

occurrence of singularities formed by the gravitational collapse in above three
particular forms of Lovelock theory of gravity. The dependence of the nature of
singularity on the existence of radial null geodesic for Vaidya space-time has

singularity increases with increase in dimensions. In dimensionally continued
Lovelock gravity, the naked singularity is possible for odd dimensions for
several values of parameters. In pure Lovelock gravity, only black hole forms
due to the gravitational collapse for any values of parameters. It has been
shown that when accretion is taking place on a collapsing object, it is highly
unlikely to get a black hole. Finally on considering the phantom era in the

distribution with density pi(x) is done using updates operating on an

ensemble, x^{(1)},...,x^{(K)}. This ensemble is then updated using MCMC updates
that leave invariant a suitable ensemble density, rho(x^{(1)},...,x^{(K)}),
defined in terms of pi(x^{(i)}) for i=1,...,K. Finally a single state is
stochastically selected from the ensemble after these updates. Such ensemble
MCMC updates can be useful when characteristics of pi and the ensemble permit
pi(x^{(i)}) for all i in {1,...,K}, to be computed in less than K times the
amount of computation time needed to compute pi(x) for a single x. One common
situation of this type is when changes to some ""fast"" variables allow for quick
re-computation of the density, whereas changes to other ""slow"" variables do
not. Gaussian process regression models are an example of this sort of problem,
with an overall scaling factor for covariances and the noise variance being
fast variables. I show that ensemble MCMC for Gaussian process regression
models can indeed substantially improve sampling performance. Finally, I
discuss other possible applications of ensemble MCMC, and its relationship to

(ISM) of the barred and ringed galaxies in the presence of non-axisymmetric
components of the potential, i.e. the bar and/or the oval perturbations. The
magnetohydrodynamical dynamo is driven by cosmic rays (CR), which are
continuously supplied to the disk by supernova (SN) remnants. Additionally,
weak, dipolar and randomly oriented magnetic field is injected to the galactic
disk during SN explosions. To compare our results directly with the observed
properties of galaxies we construct realistic maps of high-frequency polarized
radio emission. The main result is that CR driven dynamo can amplify weak
magnetic fields up to few $\mu$G within few Gyr in barred and ringed galaxies.
What is more, the modelled magnetic field configuration resembles maps of the
polarized intensity observed in barred and ringed galaxies.

conducting extensive empirical survey to a large number of
cooperation-competition systems which cover wide categories and contain the
information of network topology, cooperation-competition gain, and the
evolution time, we try to get some insights to the universal mechanism of their
evolutions. Empirical investigations show that the distributions of the
cooperation-competition gain interpolates between power law function and
exponential function. Particularly, we found that the cooperation-competition
systems with longer evolution durations tend to have more heterogeneous
distributions of the cooperation-competition gain. Such an empirical
observation can be well explained by an analytic model in which the evolution
of the systems are mainly controlled by the Matthew effect, and the marginal
heterogeneity of the initial distribution is amplified by the Matthew effect
with similar speed in spite of the diversity of the investigated systems.
