precessing jets of the microquasar SS433 with the surrounding, expanding
Supernova Remnant (SNR) shell W50, and the consequent evolution in the
inhomogeneous Interstellar Medium (ISM). We model their evolution using the
hydrodynamic FLASH code, which uses adaptive mesh refinement. We show that the
peculiar morphology of the entire nebula can be reproduced to a good
approximation, due to the combined effects of: (i) the evolution of the SNR
shell from the free-expansion phase through the Sedov blast wave in an
exponential density profile from the Milky Way disc, and (ii) the subsequent
interaction of the relativistic, precessing jets of SS 433. Our simulations
reveal: (1) Independent measurement of the Galaxy scale-height and density
local to SS433 (as n_0 = 0.2 cm^{-3}, Z_d = 40 pc), with this scale-height
being in excellent agreement with the work of Dehnen & Binney. (2) A new
mechanism for hydrodynamic refocusing of conical jets. (3) The current jet
precession characteristics do not simply extrapolate back to produce the lobes
of W50 but a history of episodic jet activity having at least 3 different
outbursts with different precession characteristics would be sufficient to
produce the W50 nebula. A history of intermittent episodes of jet activity from
SS433 is also suggested in a kinematic study of W50 detailed in a companion
paper (Goodall et al, MNRAS submitted). (4) An estimate of the age of W50, and
equivalently the age of SS433's black hole created during the supernova
explosion, in the range of 17,000 - 21,000 years.

driven away from detailed balance by a nonconservative force. A systematic
expansion is obtained of the stationary distribution around an equilibrium
reference, in orders of the nonequilibrium forcing. The first order around
equilibrium has been known since the work of McLennan (1959), and involves the
transient irreversible entropy flux. The expansion generalizes the McLennan
formula to higher orders, complementing the entropy flux with the dynamical
activity. The latter is more kinetic than thermodynamic and is a possible
realization of Landauer's insight (1975) that, for nonequilibrium, the relative
occupation of states also depends on the noise along possible escape routes. In
that way nonlinear response around equilibrium can be meaningfully discussed in
terms of two main quantities only, the entropy flux and the dynamical activity.
The expansion makes mathematical sense as shown in the simplest cases from
exponential ergodicity.

go beyond mean-field models that consider that all minima are connected to each
other. We consider several possibilities for the transition rates between
minima, and show that in all cases the existence of a glassy phase depends on a
delicate interplay between the network's topology and the relationship between
energy and degree of a minimum. Interestingly, the network's degree
correlations and the details of the transition rates do not play any role in
the existence (nor in the value) of the transition temperature, but have an
impact only on more involved properties. For Glauber or Metropolis rates in
particular, we find that the low-temperature phase can be further divided into
two regions with different scaling properties of the average trapping time.
Overall, our results rationalize and link the empirical findings about
correlations between the energy of the minima and their degree, and should
stimulate further investigations on this issue.

challenging work in the post-genomic era, partly due to the vast space of
possible networks and the relatively small amount of data available. In this
field, Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) provides a convenient framework for the
discovery of biological networks. In this paper, we propose an original
approach for inferring gene regulation networks using a robust biological prior
on their structure in order to limit the set of candidate networks.
  Pathways, that represent biological knowledge on the regulatory networks,
will be used as an informative prior knowledge to drive Network Inference. This
approach is based on the selection of a relevant set of genes, called the
""molecular signature"", associated with a condition of interest (for instance,
the genes involved in disease development). In this context, differential
expression analysis is a well established strategy. However outcome signatures
are often not consistent and show little overlap between studies. Thus, we will
dedicate the first part of our work to the improvement of the standard process
of biomarker identification to guarantee the robustness and reproducibility of
the molecular signature.
  Our approach enables to compare the networks inferred between two conditions
of interest (for instance case and control networks) and help along the
biological interpretation of results. Thus it allows to identify differential
regulations that occur in these conditions. We illustrate the proposed approach
by applying our method to a study of breast cancer's response to treatment.

density difference between local LIRGs and local non-LIRG IR galaxies. LIRGs
live in denser environments than non-LIRG IR galaxies implying that L_IR=10^11

around LIRGs and their L_IR luminosity, while the IR-activity of non-LIRG IR
galaxies does not show any dependence on environment. This trend is independent
of mass-bin selection. The SF-density trend in local LIRGs is similar to that
found in some studies of blue cloud galaxies at z~1 which show a correlation
between star formation and local density (the reversal of the relation seen for
local galaxies). This, together with the rapid decline of the number count of
LIRGs since z~1, could mean that local LIRGs are survivors of whatever process

foreground from the zodiacal light that outshines the faint cosmological
diffuse radiation field by more than an order of magnitude. Indirect
constraints on the EBL are provided by gamma-ray observations of AGN. Using the
combination of the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope together with the current
generation of ground-based air Cherenkov telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and
VERITAS) provides unprecedented sensitivity and spectral coverage for
constraining the EBL in the near- to mid-IR. In this paper we present new
limits on the EBL based on the analysis of the broad-band spectra of a select
set of gamma-ray blazars covering 200 MeV to several TeV. The EBL intensity at
15 microns is constrained to be 1.36 +/- 0.58 nW m^-2 sr^-1. We find that the
fast evolution and baseline EBL models of Stecker et al. (2006), as well as the
model of Kneiske et al. (2004), predict significantly higher EBL intensities in
the mid-IR (15 microns) than is allowed by the constraints derived here. In
addition, the model of Franceschini et al. (2008) and the fiducial model of
Dominguez et al. (2011) predict near- to mid-IR ratios smaller than that
predicted by our analysis. Namely, their intensities in the near-IR are too low
while their intensities in the mid-IR are marginally too high. All of the
aforementioned models are inconsistent with our analysis at the >3 sigma level.

function f, using as few evaluations f(x) as possible. It can be considered as
a continuum-armed bandit problem, with noiseless data and simple regret.
Expected improvement is perhaps the most popular method for solving this
problem; the algorithm performs well in experiments, but little is known about
its theoretical properties. Implementing expected improvement requires a choice
of Gaussian process prior, which determines an associated space of functions,
its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is fixed, expected
improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in the RKHS. We
begin by providing convergence rates for this procedure. The rates are optimal
for functions of low smoothness, and we modify the algorithm to attain optimal
rates for smoother functions. For practitioners, however, these results are
somewhat misleading. Priors are typically not held fixed, but depend on
parameters estimated from the data. For standard estimators, we show this
procedure may never discover the minimum of f. We then propose alternative
estimators, chosen to minimize the constants in the rate of convergence, and
show these estimators retain the convergence rates of a fixed prior.

considers the gauge transformations of perturbative quantities, choosing a
gauge by requiring that certain quantities vanish, rendering all other
variables gauge invariant. In the KN2010 formalism, one decomposes the metric
tensor into a gauge variant and gauge invariant part from the outset. We
compare the two approaches in both the longitudinal and uniform curvature
gauges. In the longitudinal gauge, we find that Nakamura's gauge invariant
variables correspond exactly to those in the longitudinal gauge (i.e., for
scalar perturbations, to the Bardeen potentials), and in the uniform curvature
gauge we obtain the usual relationship between gauge invariant variables in the
flat and longitudinal gauge. Thus, we show that these two approaches are
equivalent.

explained as hot plasma vacuums generated upstream of a slow magnetoacoustic
shock wave produced by a localized deposition of energy. In this work, we show
that the overall 2D results are in agreement with the observational behaviour.
However they show a slight shift in the characteristic parameter with respect
to those found previously. Also, we confirm qualitatively the behaviour found
in the previous papers, i.e. for a given numerical domain the period of the
kink--like structure is a function of the magnetic field intensity: larger
periods are associated with lower magnetic field intensities. Contrary to the
1D result -where the sunward dynamic is independent of the magnetic field
intensity due to its exclusively waveguide role- in the 2D simulation the
sunward speed is larger for larger values of the magnetic field. This can be
interpreted as the capability of the low coronal plasma to collimate the
deposition of energy into the magnetic field direction. The moving features
consistent of low--density and high--temperature plasma cavities have larger
inside values of the structuring parameter beta than the neighboring media.
Thus, the voids seem to be the emergence structures of a whole nonlinear
interacting plasma context of shocks and waves more than voided plasma loops
magnetically structured.

emission. We also detect hidden mid-IR emission of its southern shell after
subtraction of the background emission in this region. The far-IR luminosity of
the western shell is ~ 8100 L_sun, which makes Kes 17 one of the few SNRs of
significant far-IR emission. The fittings of the spectral energy distribution
indicate the existence of two dust components: ~ 79 K (hot) and ~ 27 K (cold)
corresponding to the dust mass of ~ 6.2x10^{-4} M_sun and ~ 6.7 M_sun,
respectively. We suggest that the hot component represents the dust emission of
the material swept up by the SNR to its western and southern boundaries,
compatible with the distribution of radio continuum emission overlapping the
mid-IR emission in the western and southern shells. The existence of hot (~
2,000 K), shocked dense molecular gas revealed by the near-IR molecular line
emission in the western shell, on the other hand, suggests that the cold dust
component represents the dust emission related to the interaction between the
SNR and nearby molecular gas. The excitation conditions of the molecular gas
appear to be consistent with those from shocked, clumpy admixture gas of
different temperatures. We discuss three possibilities for the origin of the
bright far-IR emission of the cold dust in the western shell: the emission of
dust in the inter-clump medium of shocked molecular clouds, the emission of
dust in evaporating flows of molecular clouds engulfed by hot gas, and the
emission of dust of nearby molecular clouds illuminated by radiative shocks.

Termination Shock (HTS) - which covered the period from the launch of V1 and V2

the solar wind speed, ram pressure and magnetic field decreased to the lowest
levels in recent history, related to the sunspot minimum in 2008-2009. The HTS
distance has decreased correspondingly so that V1, which was crossed by the HTS
at 94 AU in late 2004, would now, in early 2011, be expected to reach the HTS
at a distance ~80 AU, when the HTS distance would be expected to be at its
minimum. Similarly V2, which was crossed by the HTS at 84 AU in mid 2007,
would, in early 2011, reach the HTS at a distance of only 74 AU. These
distances, in early 2011, are ~15% less than those at which V1 and V2 initially
reached the HTS. The distance to the Heliopause (HP) is more uncertain but
recent calculations place its equilibrium distance at between 1.4-1.6 times the
HTS distance. Allowing for an additional 1 year for the HP to reach its
equilibrium minimum distance relative to the HTS would mean that, assuming this
distance remains a constant fraction larger than the HTS distance, the HP
distance would be at its minimum distance of (1.4-1.6) x 80 AU = 112-128 AU at
V1 in early 2012. At this time V1 will be at a distance of ~120 AU so that
there is a possibility that V1 could cross the HP and enter interstellar space
at the time 2012.0 \pm 1 year. If the crossing does not happen during this time
period, then it is unlikely that V1 will reach this defining boundary before
about 2016 because of the expected outward motion of the HTS and the HP towards
their more normal distances of 85-96 and ~120 -140 AU coincident with the
maximum of the new sunspot cycle.

in active galaxies allows for study of the star formation history of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts. The FIR is also an important spectral region for
observing AGN which are heavily enshrouded by dust, such as Compton thick AGN.
By using information from deep X-ray surveys and cosmic X-ray background
synthesis models, we compute Cloudy photoionization simulations which are used
to predict the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN in the FIR. Expected
differential number counts of AGN and their host galaxies are calculated in the
Herschel bands. The expected contribution of AGN and their hosts to the cosmic
infrared background (CIRB) and the infrared luminosity density are also
computed. Multiple star formation scenarios are investigated using a modified
blackbody star formation SED. It is found that FIR observations at ~500 um are
an excellent tool in determining the star formation history of AGN hosts.
Additionally, the AGN contribution to the CIRB can be used to determine whether
star formation in AGN hosts evolves differently than in normal galaxies. The
contribution of Compton thick AGN to the bright end differential number counts
and to the bright source infrared luminosity density is a good test of AGN
evolution models where quasars are triggered by major mergers.

the scalar $\theta$ by $u=\nabla^\perp\Lambda^{\beta-2}\theta$, where
$1<\beta\le 2$ and $\Lambda=(-\Delta)^{1/2}$ is the Zygmund operator. The
borderline case $\beta=1$ corresponds to the SQG equation and the situation is
more singular for $\beta>1$. We obtain the local existence and uniqueness of
classical solutions, the global existence of weak solutions and the local
existence of patch type solutions. The second family is a dissipative active
scalar equation with $u=\nabla^\perp (\log(I-\Delta))^\mu\theta$ for $\mu>0$,
which is at least logarithmically more singular than the velocity in the first

population of close-in exoplanets shows a distinctive discontinuity located at
approximately one Jovian mass. Most smaller planets have orbital periods longer
than P~2.5 days, while higher masses are found down to P~1 day.
  We analyze whether this observed mass-period distribution could be explained
in terms of the combined effects of stellar tides and the interactions of
planets with an inner cavity in the gaseous disk.
  We performed a series of hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of
single-planet systems in a gaseous disk with an inner cavity mimicking the
inner boundary of the disk. The subsequent tidal evolution is analyzed assuming
that orbital eccentricities are small and stellar tides are dominant.
  We find that most of the close-in exoplanet population is consistent with an
inner edge of the protoplanetary disk being located at approximately P>2 days
for solar-type stars, in addition to orbital decay having been caused by
stellar tides with a specific tidal parameter on the order of Q'*=10^7. The
data is broadly consistent with planets more massive than one Jupiter mass
undergoing type II migration, crossing the gap, and finally halting at the
interior 2/1 mean-motion resonance with the disk edge. Smaller planets do not
open a gap in the disk and remain trapped in the cavity edge. CoRoT-7b appears
detached from the remaining exoplanet population, apparently requiring
additional evolutionary effects to explain its current mass and semimajor axis.

scalar field that generates nearly scale invariant curvature fluctuations
through a purely ""adiabatic mechanism"" in which the background evolution is a
dynamical attractor. Despite the starkly different physical mechanism for
generating fluctuations, the two-point function is identical to inflation. In
this paper, we further explore this concept, focusing in particular on issues
of non-gaussianity and quantum corrections. We find that the degeneracy with
inflation is broken at three-point level: for the simplest case of an
exponential potential, the three-point amplitude is strongly scale dependent,
resulting in a breakdown of perturbation theory on small scales. However, we
show that the perturbative breakdown can be circumvented -- and all issues
raised in Linde et al. (arXiv:0912.0944) can be addressed -- by altering the
potential such that power is suppressed on small scales. The resulting range of
nearly scale invariant, gaussian modes can be as much as twelve e-folds, enough
to span the scales probed by microwave background and large scale structure
observations. On smaller scales, the spectrum is not scale invariant but is
observationally acceptable.

M_r, with metal poor stars having fainter absolute magnitudes than higher

measure the velocity ellipsoid and solar reflex motion for each subsample of M
dwarfs. We find good agreement between our measured solar peculiar motion and
previous results for similar populations, as well as some evidence for
differing motions of early and late M type populations in U and W velocities
that cannot be attributed to asymmetric drift. The reflex solar motion and the
velocity dispersions both show that younger populations, as traced by magnetic
activity and location near the Galactic plane, have experienced less dynamical
heating. We introduce a new parameter, the independent position altitude (IPA),

Focusing on z = 0 and 2, we study the metallicities and metal mass fractions
for stars as well as for the ISM, and several more diffuse gas phases. We vary
the cooling rates, star formation law, structure of the ISM, galactic winds,
feedback from AGN, reionization history, stellar IMF, and cosmology. In all
models stars and the warm-hot IGM (WHIM) constitute the dominant repository of
metals, while for z > 2 the ISM is also important. In models with galactic
winds, predictions for the metallicities of the various phases vary at the
factor of two level and are broadly consistent with observations. The exception
is the cold-warm IGM, whose metallicity varies at the order of magnitude level
if the prescription for galactic winds is varied, even for a fixed wind energy
per unit stellar mass formed, and falls far below the observed values if winds
are not included. At the other extreme, the metallicity of the intracluster
medium (ICM) is largely insensitive to the presence of galactic winds,
indicating that its enrichment is regulated by other processes. The mean
metallicities of stars (~ Z_sun), the ICM (~ 0.1 Z_sun), and the WHIM (~ 0.1
Z_sun) evolve only slowly, while those of the cold halo gas and the IGM
increase by more than an order of magnitude from z = 5 to 0. Higher velocity
outflows are more efficient at transporting metals to low densities, but
actually predict lower metallicities for the cold-warm IGM since the winds
shock-heat the gas to high temperatures, thereby increasing the fraction of the
metals residing in, but not the metallicity of, the WHIM. Besides galactic
winds driven by feedback from star formation, the metal distribution is most
sensitive to the inclusion of metal-line cooling and feedback from AGN.

stellar velocity dispersion of the central galaxy, essential for separating the
baryonic mass distribution in the cluster core. Hydrostatic mass estimates from
Chandra X-ray observations further constrain the solution. These combined
datasets provide nearly continuous constraints extending from 2 kpc to 1.5 Mpc
in radius, allowing stringent tests of results from recent numerical
simulations. Two key improvements in our data and its analysis make this the
most robust case yet for a shallow slope \beta of the DM density profile
\rho_DM ~ r^-\beta on small scales. First, following deep Keck spectroscopy, we
have secured the stellar velocity dispersion profile to a radius of 26 kpc for
the first time in a lensing cluster. Secondly, we improve our previous analysis
by adopting a triaxial DM distribution and axisymmetric dynamical models. We
demonstate that in this remarkably well-constrained system, the logarithmic
slope of the DM density at small radii is \beta < 1.0 (95% confidence). An
improved treatment of baryonic physics is necessary, but possibly insufficient,
to reconcile our observations with the recent results of high-resolution

Given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size and geometry, the code
returns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given model of the Milky Way.
The model can be specified by a set of density distributions or as an N-body
realization. We provide fast and efficient algorithms for sampling both types
of models. As compared to earlier sampling schemes which generate stars at
specified locations along a line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuous
and smooth distribution of stars over any given volume. The code is quite
general and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate,
age metallicity relation, age velocity dispersion relation and analytic density
distribution functions. Theoretical isochrones are then used to generate a
catalog of stars and support is available for a wide range of photometric
bands. As a concrete example we implement the Besancon Milky Way model for the
disc. For the stellar halo we employ the simulated stellar halo N-body models
of Bullock & Johnston (2005). In order to sample N-body models, we present a
scheme that disperses the stars spawned by an N-body particle, in such a way
that the phase space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that of
the N-body particles. The code is ideally suited to generating synthetic data
sets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as GAIA, LSST and HERMES. As
an application we study the prospect of identifying structures in the stellar
halo with a simulated GAIA survey. We plan to make the code publicly available

Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we compare the relative efficiency of gas inflows
from these two processes. We use two indicators of gas inflow: star formation
rate (SFR) and gas phase metallicity, which are both measured relative to
control samples. Whereas the metallicity of galaxy pairs is suppressed relative
to its control sample of isolated galaxies, galaxies with bars are metal-rich
for their stellar mass by 0.06 dex over all stellar masses. The SFRs of both
the close galaxy pairs and the barred galaxies are enhanced by ~60%, but in the
bars the enhancement is only seen at stellar masses M* >10^10 M_solar. Taking
into account the relative frequency of bars and pairs, we estimate that at
least three times more central star formation is triggered by bars than by
interactions.

exterior is described by the standard Kerr naked singularity geometry breaking
the black hole limit on the internal angular momentum (spin). We construct
local photon escape cones for a variety of orbiting sources that enable to
determine the superspinars silhouette in the case of distant observers. We show
that the superspinar silhouette depends strongly on the assumed edge where the
external Kerr spacetime is joined to the internal spacetime governed by the
string theory and significantly differs from the black hole silhouette. The
appearance of the accretion disc is strongly dependent on the value of the
superspinar spin in both their shape and frequency shift profile. Apparent
extension of the disc grows significantly with growing spin, while the
frequency shift grows with descending spin. This behavior differs substantially
from appearance of discs orbiting black holes enabling thus, at least in
principle, to distinguish clearly the Kerr superspinars and black holes. In
vicinity of a Kerr superspinar the non-escaped photons have to be separated to
those captured by the superspinar and those being trapped in its strong
gravitational field leading to self-illumination of the disc that could even
influence its structure and causes self-reflection effect of radiation of the
disc. The amount of trapped photons grows with descending of the superspinar
spin. We thus can expect significant self-illumination effects in the field of
Kerr superspinars with near-extreme spin $a \sim 1$.

polarimetric outbursts which interrupt these disk-loss events, we find that the
ratio of the polarization across the Balmer jump (BJ+/BJ-) versus the V-band
polarization traces a distinct loop structure as a function of time. Since the
polarization change across the Balmer jump is a tracer of the innermost disk
density whereas the V-band polarization is a tracer of the total scattering
mass of the disk, we suggest such correlated loop structures in Balmer jump-V
band polarization diagrams (BJV diagrams) provide a unique diagnostic of the
radial distribution of mass within Be disks. We use the 3-D Monte Carlo
radiation transfer code HDUST to reproduce the observed clockwise loops simply
by turning ""on/off"" the mass decretion from the disk. We speculate that
counter-clockwise loop structures we observe in BJV diagrams might be caused by
the mass decretion rate changing between subsequent ""on/off"" sequences.
Applying this new diagnostic to a larger sample of Be disk systems will provide
insight into the time-dependent nature of each system's stellar decretion rate.

the constrained transport (CT) method for enforcing the solenoidal constraint
on the magnetic field. A variety of approximate Riemann solvers are implemented
to compute the fluxes of the conserved variables. The methods are tested with a
comprehensive suite of multidimensional problems. These tests have helped us
develop a hierarchy of correction steps that are applied when the integration
algorithm predicts unphysical states due to errors in the fluxes, or errors in
the inversion between conserved and primitive variables. Although used
exceedingly rarely, these corrections dramatically improve the stability of the
algorithm. We present preliminary results from the application of these
algorithms to two problems in RMHD: the propagation of supersonic magnetized
jets, and the amplification of magnetic field by turbulence driven by the
relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Both of these applications
reveal important differences between the results computed with Riemann solvers
that adopt different approximations for the fluxes. For example, we show that
use of Riemann solvers which include both contact and rotational
discontinuities can increase the strength of the magnetic field within the
cocoon by a factor of ten in simulations of RMHD jets, and can increase the
spectral resolution of three-dimensional RMHD turbulence driven by the KHI by a
factor of 2. This increase in accuracy far outweighs the associated increase in
computational cost. Our RMHD scheme is publicly available as part of the Athena

users are first allowed to negotiate for the use of a simple Han-Kobayashi type

associated bargaining problem. First, the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) is
used as a tool to get fair information rates and the operating point is
obtained as a result of an optimization problem. Next, a dynamic
alternating-offer bargaining game (AOBG) from bargaining theory is introduced
to model the bargaining process and the rates resulting from negotiation are
characterized. The relationship between the NBS and the equilibrium outcome of

with intermediate widths (~25A) in the first ~40 days after optical maximum. We
examine a variety of models for the line wings and conclude that multiple
scattering is most likely, implying that our spectra contain no specific

ROTSE light curve subject to the rise time and the nature of the spectra,
including radioactive decay, shocks in optically-thick and optically-thin

which the CSM is optically-thick and in which diffusion of forward
shock-deposited luminosity gives rise to the observed light curve. Diffusion of
the shock-deposited energy from the forward shock is found to be important to
account for the rising part of the light curve. Although there are differences

measure parameters of coalescing massive black hole binaries, often to
extremely high accuracy. Previous work has demonstrated that the black hole
spins can have a strong impact on the accuracy of parameter measurement.
Relativistic spin-induced precession modulates the waveform in a manner which
can break degeneracies between parameters, in principle significantly improving
how well they are measured. Recent studies have indicated, however, that spin
precession may be weak for an important subset of astrophysical binary black
holes: those in which the spins are aligned due to interactions with gas. In
this paper, we examine how well a binary's parameters can be measured when its
spins are partially aligned and compare results using waveforms that include
higher post-Newtonian harmonics to those that are truncated at leading
quadrupole order. We find that the weakened precession can substantially
degrade parameter estimation. This degradation is particularly devastating for
the extrinsic parameters sky position and distance. Absent higher harmonics,
LISA typically localizes the sky position of a nearly aligned binary a factor
of $\sim 6$ less accurately than for one in which the spin orientations are
random. Our knowledge of a source's sky position will thus be worst for the
gas-rich systems which are most likely to produce electromagnetic counterparts.
Fortunately, higher harmonics of the waveform can make up for this degradation.
By including harmonics beyond the quadrupole in our waveform model, we find
that the accuracy with which most of the binary's parameters are measured can
be substantially improved. In some cases, parameters can be measured as well in
partially aligned binaries as they can be when the binary spins are random.

and its observational consequences for where stars fall on the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). In contrast to most previous work, our
models follow stars as they grow from small masses via accretion, and we
perform a systematic study of how the stars' HRD evolution is influenced by
their initial radius, by the radiative properties of the accretion flow, and by
the accretion history, using both simple idealized accretion histories and
histories taken from numerical simulations of star cluster formation. We
compare our numerical results to both non-accreting isochrones and to the
positions of observed stars in the HRD, with a goal of determining whether both
the absolute ages and the age dispersions inferred from non-accreting
isochrones are reliable. We show that non-accreting isochrones can sometimes
overestimate stellar ages for more massive stars (those with effective
temperatures above \sim 3500 K), thereby explaining why non-accreting
isochrones often suggest a systematic age difference between more and less
massive stars in the same cluster. However, we also find the only way to
produce a similar overestimate for the ages of cooler stars is by selecting
parameters that are strongly inconsistent with both theoretical models and
observational constraints. We therefore conclude that inferred ages and age
spreads for cool stars are reliable, at least to the extent that the observed
bolometric luminosities and temperatures are accurate. Finally, we note that
the time-dependence of the mass accretion rate has remarkably little effect on
low-mass stars' evolution on the HRD, and that such time-dependence may be
neglected for all stars except those with effective temperatures above \sim
4000 K.

some sense, it appears to be possible to view the two component Dirac spinor as
a single component, quaternionic, spacetime scalar. ""Spin space""
transformations can be considered transformations of the internal quaternion
basis. Essentially, quaternionic Dirac Theory projects into the complex plane
neatly, where spin becomes related to the self-dual antisymmetric part of the
metric. The correct Dirac eigenvalues and well-behaved eigenfunctions project
intact into a pair of complex solutions for the scalar curvature in the earlier
theory's Weyl-Cartan type geometry. Some estimates are made for predicted,
interesting atomic and subatomic scale phenomena. A form of electromagnetic
quanta appears. A generalization of the complex geometric structure is then
sketched in an appendix that allows quaternionic gauges and curvatures, and has
some Weyl nonmetricity mixed with torsion. It appears to be a well defined
structure, and leads to the full, second order, quaternionic Dirac Equation
form, and a first order equation for a closely related, auxiliary wavefunction.
A family of ""free particle"" solutions is examined in the Lorentzian limit of
the symmetric part of the metric. More generally, when limited to two
quaternion dimensions (just two components), reasonably similar solutions can
be superposed linearly into new solutions, and separate into two families with
different commutation characteristics. The integrability conditions for the
equation for the auxiliary wavefunction impose six conditions on the original

LASCO data. We note the limitation of coronagraphs duo to geometry or
sensitivity, leading to many smaller CMEs that are Earth-directed or well out
of the plane of sky not being detected by near-Earth spacecraft. Excluding
those without corresponding LASCO data, the CME association rate of
active-region filament eruptions clearly increases with X-ray flare class from
about 32% for C-class flares to 100% for X-class flares. The eruptions of
active-region filaments associated with Halo CMEs are often accompanied by
large flares. About 92% events associated with X-class flare are associated
with Halo CMEs. Such a result is due to that the Earth-directed CMEs detected
as Halo CMEs are often the larger CMEs and many of the smaller ones are not
detected because of the geometry and low intensity. The average speed of the
associated CMEs of filament eruptions increases with X-ray flare size from
563.7 km/s for C-class flares to 1506.6 km/s for X-class flares. Moreover, the
magnetic emergence and cancellation play an important role in triggering
filament eruptions. These findings may be instructive to not only in respect to
the modeling of active-region filament eruptions but also in predicting flares
and CMEs.

an increasing evolution in the GRB rate relative to the ordinary star formation
rate at high redshifts. We then assume only massive stars with masses greater
than the critical value to produce GRBs, and use an evolving stellar IMF
suggested by Dav\'{e} (2010) to fit the latest GRB redshift distribution. This
evolving IMF would increase the relative number of massive stars, which could
lead to more GRB explosions at high redshifts. We find that the evolving IMF
can well reproduce the observed redshift distribution of Swift GRBs.

contourlet, or shearlets have recently attracted significantly increased
attention due to the fact that they were shown to provide optimally sparse
approximations of functions exhibiting singularities on lower dimensional
embedded manifolds. The literature now contains various direct proofs of this
fact and of related sparse approximation results. However, it seems quite
cumbersome to prove such a canon of results for each system separately, while
many of the systems exhibit certain similarities. In this paper, with the
introduction of the concept of sparsity equivalence, we aim to provide a
framework which allows categorization of the ability for sparse approximations
of representation systems. This framework, in particular, enables transferring
results on sparse approximations from one system to another. We demonstrate
this concept for the example of curvelets and shearlets, and discuss how this
viewpoint immediately leads to novel results for both systems.

scales approaching the Planck scale (10^{19} GeV). With present photon data
from the observations of distant astrophysical sources, it is possible to
constrain the Lorentz Symmetry breaking linear term in the standard photon
dispersion relations. Gamma-ray Bursts (GRB) and flaring Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) are complementary to each other for this purpose, since they are observed
at different distances in different energy ranges and with different levels of
variability. Following a previous publication of the High Energy Stereoscopic
System (H.E.S.S.) collaboration, a more sensitive event-by-event method
consisting of a likelihood fit is applied to PKS 2155-304 flare data of MJD
53944 (July 28, 2006) as used in the previous publication. The previous limit
on the linear term is improved by a factor of ~3 up to M^{l}_{QG} > 2.1x10^{18}

which the solid particle volume fraction along the central line of the pant-leg

possible for bed inventory overturn. Although the lateral pressure difference
generated from lateral mass transfer inhibits continuing lateral mass transfer,
providing the pant-leg CFB with self-balancing ability to some extent, the
primary flow rate change due to the outlet pressure change often disable the
self-balancing ability by continually enhancing the flow rate difference. As
the flow rate of the primary air fan is more sensitive to its outlet pressure,
it is easier to lead to bed inventory overturn. While when the solid particle
is easier to change its flow patter to follow the surrounding air flow,the

sciences are quantitative prediction of system dynamics and model based
optimization. For this purpose, mathematical modeling, numerical simulation and
scientific computing techniques are indispensable. Quantitative modeling
closely combined with experimental investigations is required if the model is
supposed to be used for sound mechanistic analysis and model predictions.
Typically, before an appropriate model of a experimental system is found
different hypothetical models might be reasonable and consistent with previous
knowledge and available data. The parameters of the model up to an estimated
confidence region are generally not known a priori. Therefore one has to
incorporate possible parameter configurations of different models into a model
discrimination algorithm. In this article we present a numerical algorithm
which calculates a design of experiments which allows an optimal discrimination
of different hypothetic candidate models of a given dynamic system for the most
inappropriate parameter configurations within a parameter range via a worst
case estimate. The design criterion comprises optimal measurement time points.
The used criterion is derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The
underlying optimization problem can be classified as a semi infinite
optimization problem which we solve in an outer approximation approach
stabilized by a homotopy strategy. We present the theoretical framework as well
as the numerical algorithmic realization.

collisions at $\sqrt{s}=0.9$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV, measured by the ALICE
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The correlation functions as well as
the extracted source radii scale with event multiplicity and pair momentum.
When analyzed in the same multiplicity and pair transverse momentum range, the
correlation is similar at the two collision energies. A three-dimensional
femtoscopic analysis shows an increase of the emission zone with increasing
event multiplicity as well as decreasing homogeneity lengths with increasing
transverse momentum. The latter trend gets more pronounced as multiplicity
increases. This suggests the development of space-momentum correlations, at
least for collisions producing a high multiplicity of particles. We consider
these trends in the context of previous femtoscopic studies in high-energy
hadron and heavy-ion collisions, and discuss possible underlying physics
mechanisms. Detailed analysis of the correlation reveals an exponential shape
in the outward and longitudinal directions, while the sideward remains a
Gaussian. This is interpreted as a result of a significant contribution of
strongly decaying resonances to the emission region shape. Significant
non-femtoscopic correlations are observed, and are argued to be the consequence
of ""mini-jet""-like structures extending to low $p_{\rm T}$. They are well
reproduced by the Monte-Carlo generators and seen also in $\pi^+\pi^-$
correlations.

radiation (SKR) on 17 October 2008. On this occasion, the Radio and Plasma Wave
Science (RPWS) experiment detected both local and distant radio sources, while
plasma parameters were measured in situ by the magnetometer (MAG) and the
Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS). A goniopolarimetric inversion was applied
to RPWS 3-antenna electric measurements to determine the wave vector k and the
complete state of polarization of detected waves. We identify broadband
extraordinary (X) as well as narrowband ordinary (O) mode SKR at low
frequencies. Within the source region, SKR is emitted just above the X mode
cutoff frequency in a hot plasma, with a typical electron-to-wave energy
conversion efficiency of 1% (2% peak). The knowledge of the k-vector is then
used to derive the locus of SKR sources in the kronian magnetosphere, that
shows X and O components emanating from the same regions. We also compute the
associated beaming angle at the source theta'=(k,-B) either from (i) in situ
measurements or a model of the magnetic field vector or from (ii) polarization
measurements. Obtained results, similar for both modes, suggest
quasi-perpendicular emission for local sources, whereas the beaming pattern of
distant sources appears as a hollow cone with a frequency-dependent constant
aperture angle: theta'=75{\deg}+/-15{\deg} below 300kHz, decreasing at higher
frequencies to reach theta'(1000kHz)=50{\deg}+/-25{\deg}. Finally, we
investigate quantitatively the SKR polarization state, observed to be strongly
elliptical at the source, and quasi-purely circular for sources located beyond
approximately 2 kronian radii. We show that conditions of weak mode coupling
are achieved along the ray path, under which the magneto-ionic theory
satisfactorily describes the evolution of the observed polarization.

  equations","17 pages",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The successive approximations method allows us to solve problems concerning
existence and uniqueness of fixed points of wide classes of operators. The
classical result in this field, such as Banach -- Caccioppoli principle
together with some its modification and generalisations, is applicable to
operators satisfying Lipschitz condition with a small coefficient or, in other
words, to operators with the compression property. However, the successive
approximations method works well for other classes of operators that are not
compressions. In particular, the well known Kantorovich fixed point principle
for differentiable operators deals with operators that, in general, are not
compression; moreover, this principle covers some cases when Banach --
Caccioppoli principle is nonapplicable. In the article it is presented some
modification of Kantorovich fixed point principle that covers nondifferentiable
operators. We describe the exact (unimprovable) estimates of the internal and
external radius of the domain of existence of a unique fixed point of the
operator under consideration and, in addition, we present new apriori and
aposteriori error estimates for successive approximations to the corresponding
fixed point. Some applications of the new fixed point principle to nonlinear
integral operators of different types are given as well.

prove the existence of the global uniformly subsonic flow in a general

Furthermore, we show that there exists a critical value of the incoming mass
flux such that a global uniformly subsonic flow exists uniquely, provided that
the incoming mass flux is less than the critical value. This gives a positive
answer to the problem of Bers on global subsonic irrotational flows in

question that we address is: what is the probability of the set of paths of C

that under finite acceptance criteria this equals the reachability probability
in a finite piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDP), whereas for Muller
acceptance criteria it coincides with the reachability probability of terminal
strongly connected components in such a PDP. Qualitative verification is shown
to amount to a graph analysis of the PDP. Reachability probabilities in our
PDPs are then characterized as the least solution of a system of Volterra
integral equations of the second type and are shown to be approximated by the
solution of a system of partial differential equations. For single-clock DTA,
this integral equation system can be transformed into a system of linear
equations where the coefficients are solutions of ordinary differential
equations. As the coefficients are in fact transient probabilities in CTMCs,
this result implies that standard algorithms for CTMC analysis suffice to
verify single-clock DTA specifications.

interpret our MWC 297 observations, we employed disk-wind models. The measured

of ~2.2 mas (~0.56 AU at a distance of 250 pc), which is ~5.4 times smaller
than the 3 AU dust sublimation radius expected for silicate grains (in the
absence of radiation-shielding material). The strongly wavelength-dependent and
asymmetric Br gamma-emitting region is more extended (~2.7 times) than the
continuum-emitting region. At the center of the Br gamma line, we derive a
Gaussian fit radius of ~6.3 mas HWHM (~1.6 AU). To interpret the observations,
we employ a magneto-centrifugally driven disk-wind model consisting of an
accretion disk, which emits the observed continuum radiation, and a disk wind,
which emits the Br gamma line. The calculated wavelength-dependent model
intensity distributions and Br gamma line profiles are compared with the
observations (i.e., K-band spectrum, visibilities, differential phases, and
closure phases). The closest fitting model predicts a continuum-emitting disk
with an inner radius of ~0.3 AU and a disk wind ejection region with an inner
radius of ~0.5 AU (~17.5 stellar radii). We obtain a disk-wind half-opening
angle (the angle between the rotation axis and the innermost streamline of the
disk wind) of ~80 degrees, which is larger than in T Tau models, and a disk
inclination angle of ~20 degrees (i.e., almost pole-on).

electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulation approach. Unlike earlier
implicit electrostatic PIC approaches (which are based on a linearized
Vlasov-Poisson formulation), ours is based on a nonlinearly converged
Vlasov-Amp\`ere (VA) model. By iterating particles and fields to a tight
nonlinear convergence tolerance, the approach features superior stability and
accuracy properties, avoiding most of the accuracy pitfalls in earlier implicit
PIC implementations. In particular, the formulation is stable against temporal
(CFL) and spatial (aliasing) instabilities. It is charge- and energy-conserving
to numerical roundoff for arbitrary implicit time steps. While momentum is not
exactly conserved, errors are kept small by an adaptive particle sub-stepping
orbit integrator, which is instrumental to prevent particle tunneling. The VA
model is orbit-averaged along particle orbits to enforce an energy conservation
theorem with particle sub-stepping. As a result, very large time steps,
constrained only by the dynamical time scale of interest, are possible without
accuracy loss. Algorithmically, the approach features a Jacobian-free
Newton-Krylov solver. A main development in this study is the nonlinear
elimination of the new-time particle variables (positions and velocities). Such
nonlinear elimination, which we term particle enslavement, results in a
nonlinear formulation with memory requirements comparable to those of a fluid
computation, and affords us substantial freedom in regards to the particle
orbit integrator. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the
advertised properties of the scheme. In particular, long-time ion acoustic wave
simulations show that numerical accuracy does not degrade even with very large
implicit time steps, and that significant CPU gains are possible.

elliptic flow of hadrons produced in 200 A GeV Au+Au collisions. Although
theory, in principle, predicts a well-defined relation T*tau_pi =
kappa(T)*(eta/s)(T), the precise form of kappa(T) for the matter created in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions is not known. For the popular choice kappa=3
the hadron spectra are found to be insensitive to a significant rise of eta/s
in the hadronic stage, whereas their differential elliptic flow v_2(p_T) is
strongly suppressed by large hadronic viscosity. The large viscous effects on
v_2 are strongly reduced if (as theoretically expected) kappa(T) is allowed to
grow with decreasing temperature in the hadronic stage. This implies that,
until reliable calculations of kappa(T) become available, an extraction of the
hadronic shear viscosity from a comparison between VISH2+1 and a microscopic
hadron cascade or experimental data requires a simultaneous fit of (eta/s)(T)

of dust. However, gas dominates the disk mass and its study is key to
understand the star and planet formation process. Spitzer can access gas
emission lines in the mid-infrared, providing new diagnostics of the physical
conditions in accretion disks and outflows. We have studied the spectra of 64
pre-main-sequence stars in Taurus using Spitzer/IRS observations. We have
detected H2 (17.03, 28.22 $\mu$m) emission in 6 objects, [Ne II] (12.81 $\mu$m)
in 18 objects, and [Fe II] (17.93, 25.99 $\mu$m) in 7 objects. [Ne II]
detections are found primarily in Class II objects. The luminosity of the [Ne
II] line, is in general higher for objects known to drive jets than for those
without known jets, but the two groups are not statistically distinguishable.
We have searched for correlations between the line luminosities and different
parameters related to the star-disk system. The [Ne II] luminosity is
correlated with X-ray luminosity for Class II objects. The [NeII] luminosity is
correlated with disk mass and accretion rate when the sample is divided into
high and low accretors. We also find correlations between [NeII] luminosity and
mid-IR continuum luminosity and with luminosity of the [O I] (6300 \AA) line,
the latter being an outflow tracer. [Fe II] luminosity correlates with mass
accretion rate. No correlations were found between H2 luminosity and several
tested parameters. Our study reveals a general trend toward accretion-related
phenomena as the origin of the gas emission lines. Shocks in jets and
outflowing material are more likely to play a significant role than shocks in
infalling material. The role of X-ray irradiation is less prominent but still
present for [Ne II], in particular for Class II sources, the lack of
correlation between [Fe II] and [Ne II] points toward different emitting
mechanisms.

description of a spatially inhomogeneous bosonic system with dissipation
provided by the interaction of bosons with a phonon bath. We apply our results
to model the dynamics of an interacting one-dimensional polariton system in
real space and time, analyzing in detail the role of polariton-polariton and
polariton-phonon interactions.

$(X_t)$ is a hidden Markov process and if yes to infer its parameters for all
but a subset of parametrizations that form a lower-dimensional subvariety in
parameter space. Partial answers so far available depend on extra assumptions
on the processes, which are usually centered around stationarity. Here we
present a general solution for binary-valued hidden Markov processes. Our
approach is rooted in algebraic statistics hence it is geometric in nature. We
find that the algebraic varieties associated with the probability distributions
of binary-valued hidden Markov processes are zero sets of determinantal
equations which draws a connection to well-studied objects from algebra. As a
consequence, our solution allows for algorithmic implementation based on
elementary (linear) algebraic routines.
