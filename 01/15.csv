time-dependent stochastic environment, such as the ocean, where escape from an
almost invariant region occurs due to random fluctuations. We determine
high-probability control-actuation sets by computing regions of uncertainty,
almost invariant sets, and Lagrangian Coherent Structures. The combination of
geometric and probabilistic methods allows us to design regions of control that
provide an increase in loitering time while minimizing the amount of control
actuation. We show how the loitering time in almost invariant sets scales
exponentially with respect to the control actuation, causing an exponential
increase in loitering times with only small changes in actuation force. The
result is that the control actuation makes almost invariant sets more
invariant.

reentrant transition arises due to competition between polymer-polymer and
polymer-water hydrogen bonds. The balance between the two types of hydrogen
bonding can be shifted to either direction through changes not only in
temperature, but also by pressure, mechanical force, osmotic stress or other
external influences. Both polypeptides and polynucleotides are considered

microwave photons are emitted, with a frequency tunable by the applied magnetic
field. While point contacts is an established technology their use as a photon
source is a new and potentially very useful application. We show that this
photon emission process can be detected by means of transport spectroscopy and
demonstrate stimulated emission of radiation in the 10-100 GHz range for a

common envelope (CE) event. Significant attention has been devoted in the
literature so far to the energy balance during the CE event, expected to
determine the outcome. However this question is intrinsically coupled with the
problem of what is left from the donor star after the CE and its immediate
evolution. In this paper we argue that an important stage has been overlooked:
post-CE remnant thermal readjustment phase. We propose a methodology for
unambiguously defining the post-CE remnant mass after it has been thermally
readjusted, namely by calling the core boundary the radius in the hydrogen
shell corresponding to the local maximum of the sonic velocity. We argue that
the important consequences of the thermal readjustment phase are: (i) a change
in the energy budget requirement for the CE binaries and (ii) a companion
spin-up and chemical enrichment, as a result of the mass transfer that occurs
during the remnant thermal readjustment (TR). More CE binaries are expected to
merge. If the companion is a neutron star, it will be mildly recycled during
the TR phase. The mass transfer during the TR phase is much stronger than the
accretion rate during the common envelope, and therefore satisfies the
condition for a hypercritical accretion better. We also argue that the TR phase
is responsible for a production of mildly recycled pulsars in double neutron
stars.

frequently not primordial, and could be either dynamically formed or

of binaries occur in parallel all the time. The destruction, which constantly
removes soft binaries from a binary pool, works as an energy sink and could be
a reason for cluster entering the binary-burning phase. The true binary
fraction is greater than observed, as a result, the observable binary fraction
evolves differently from the predictions. Combined measurements of binary
fractions in globular clusters suggest that most of the clusters are still
core-contracting. The formation, on other hand, affects most the more
evolutionary advanced stars, which significantly enhances the population of
X-ray sources in globular clusters. The formation of binaries with a compact
objects proceeds mainly through physical collisions, binary-binary and

at z~1. We discover that a significant fraction of all massive Mstar>10^11 Msun
galaxies are in place up to the highest redshifts we probe, with a decreasing
fraction of lower mass galaxies present at all redshifts. This is an example of
`galaxy mass downsizing', and is the result of massive galaxies forming before
lower mass ones, and not just simply ending their star formation earlier as in
traditional downsizing scenarios. We find that the faint end slope is
significantly steeper than what is found in previous investigations. We
demonstrate that this steeper mass function better matches the stellar mass
added due to star formation, thereby alleviating some of the mismatch between
these two measures of the evolution of galaxy mass. We furthermore examine the
stellar mass function divided into blue/red systems, as well as for star
forming and non-star forming galaxies. We find a similar mass downsizing
present for both blue/red and star-forming/non-star forming galaxies, and that
the low mass galaxies are mostly all blue, and are therefore creating the steep
mass functions. We furthermore show that, although there is a downsizing such
that high mass galaxies are nearer their z=0 values at high redshift, this
turns over at masses Mstar~10^10 Msun, such that the lowest mass galaxies are
more common than galaxies at slight higher masses, creating a `dip' in the
observed galaxy mass function. We argue that the galaxy assembly process may be
driven by different mechanisms at low and high masses, and that the efficiency
of the galaxy formation process is lowest at masses Mstar~10^10 Msun at 1<z<3.

depends on the velocity distribution of WIMPs in the dark halo of our Galaxy
and could lead to a daily modulation of the signal. Here we compute upper
bounds to the expected amplitude of daily modulation due to channeling using
channeling fractions that we obtained with analytic models in prior work. After
developing the general formalism, we examine the possibility of finding a daily
modulation due to channeling in the data already collected by the DAMA/NaI and

amplitudes (of the order of 10% in some instances) would not be observable for
WIMPs in the standard halo in the 13 years of data taken by the DAMA
collaboration. For these to be observable the DAMA total rate should be 1/40 of
what it is or the total DAMA exposure should be 40 times larger. The daily
modulation due to channeling will be difficult to measure in future
experiments. We find it could be observed for light WIMPs in solid Ne, assuming
no background.

insulating Peierls state is studied in the framework of the one-dimensional
spinless Holstein model. We focus on the adiabatic regime but include the full
quantum dynamics of the phonons. Using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, we track in particular the dynamic charge structure factor and the
single-particle spectrum across the transition. With increasing electron-phonon
coupling, the dynamic charge structure factor reveals the emergence of a charge
gap, and a clear signature of phonon softening at the zone boundary. The
single-particle spectral function evolves continuously across the transition.
Hybridization of the charge and phonon modes of the Luttinger liquid
description leads to two modes, one of which corresponds to the coherent
polaron band. This band acquires a gap upon entering the Peierls phase, whereas
the other mode constitutes the incoherent, high-energy spectrum with backfolded
shadow bands. Coherent polaronic motion is a direct consequence of quantum
lattice fluctuations. In the strong-coupling regime, the spectrum is described
by the static, mean-field limit. Importantly, whereas finite electron density
in general leads to screening of polaron effects, the latter reappear at half
filling due to charge ordering and lattice dimerization.

star. Near-IR spectra indicate a spectral type of L4\pm1 with a moderately low
surface gravity, making it one of the coolest young companions found to date.
The absorption lines and near-IR continuum shape of CD-35 2722 B agree
especially well the dusty field L4.5 dwarf 2MASS J22244381-0158521, while the
near-IR colors and absolute magnitudes match those of the 5 Myr old L4

appears to be an intermediate-age benchmark for L-dwarfs, with a less peaked
H-band continuum than the youngest objects and near-IR absorption lines
comparable to field objects. We fit Ames-Dusty model atmospheres to the near-IR

that the radial velocities of components A and B agree to within \pm10 km/s,
further confirming their physical association. Using the age and bolometric
luminosity of CD-35 2722 B, we derive a mass of 31\pm8 Mjup from the Lyon/Dusty
evolutionary models. Altogether, young late-M to mid-L type companions appear
to be over-luminous for their near-IR spectral type compared to field objects,

large-scale turbulence, we find that the influence of the metallicity on the

turbulent conditions this picture is much changed. While cold regions survive
in the case of solar metallicity, they are quickly heated and dispersed in
low-metallicity gas. This result suggests that star formation can be suppressed
in environments of low metallicity, unless a strong turbulent driver is acting
on time scales shorter than a few turbulent crossing times. Inter alia this
finding could explain the overall inefficient star formation as well as the
burst-like mode of star formation found in metal-poor, gas-rich systems like

Here, we investigate the prospects of detecting high-redshift dark stars with
both existing and upcoming telescopes. We find that individual dark stars with
masses below ~1e3 Msolar are intrinsically too faint even for the upcoming
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, by exploiting foreground galaxy
clusters as gravitational telescopes, certain varieties of such dark stars
should be within reach of the JWST at z=10. If more massive dark stars are able
to form, they may be detectable by JWST even in the absence of lensing. In
fact, some of the supermassive (~1e7 Msolar) dark stars recently proposed are
sufficiently bright at z=10 to be detectable even with existing facilities,
like the Hubble Space Telescope and 8-10 m telescopes on the ground. Finally,
we argue that since the hottest dark stars (Teff > 30000 K) can produce their
own HII regions, they may be substantially brighter than what estimates based

transition to far-away attractors. The terms ``critical transition'' or
``tipping point'' have been used to describe this situation. Critical
transitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications
from ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of
this paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be
applied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that
have been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what
mathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical
bifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give
a detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We
suggest that the mathematical theory of fast-slow systems provides a natural
definition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near
critical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast-slow systems.
The interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations
and random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential
early-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has
been suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal
forms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider
autocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of
early-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future
directions of the theory.

classical, merger-built bulges. We use a Spitzer, IRAC 3.6 micron image to
perform a detailed structural analysis of this galaxy. If one fits to this
image only bulge and disc components, the bulge occupies a locus in the
mass-size relation close to that of elliptical galaxies. When an outer stellar
spheroid is added to improve the fit, the bulge Sersic index drops by a factor
of ~ 2, and, if taken at face value, could mean that this bulge is actually a
disc-like, pseudo-bulge, or a bar viewed end-on. The bulge effective radius and
the bulge-to-total ratio also drop dramatically, putting the bulge in a
position closer to that of bulges in the mass-size relation. We discuss
implications from these findings, including the locus of the Sombrero bulge in
the black hole mass vs. bulge mass relation. With this new bulge mass estimate,
current dynamical estimates for the mass of the central black hole in Sombrero
are more than 10 times larger than expected, if only the bulge mass is
considered. A better agreement is found if the sum of bulge and outer spheroid
masses is considered. Furthermore, residual images show the presence of a
stellar ring and a stellar, inner ring or disc, with unprecedented clarity. We
also show that Sombrero is an outlier in scaling relations of disc galaxies
involving the disc, the spheroid and the globular cluster system, but not so
when its structural components are considered independently. In this context,
the globular cluster system of Sombrero might not be representative of disc
galaxies. Finally, we discuss the possibility that Sombrero formed as an
elliptical galaxy but accreted a massive disc, which itself has secularly
evolved, resulting in a complex and peculiar system.

problem. They can also account for the observed flavor hierarchies, but only at
the expense of little hierarchy and CP problems, which naturally require a
Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale beyond the LHC reach. We have recently shown that when
flavor issues are decoupled, and assumed to be solved by UV physics, the
framework's parameter space greatly opens. Given the possibility of a lower KK
scale and composite light quarks, this class of flavor triviality models enjoys
a rather exceptional phenomenology, which is the focus of this letter. We also
revisit the anarchic RS EDM problem, which requires m_{KK} > 8 TeV, and show
that it is solved within flavor triviality models. Interestingly, our framework
can induce a sizable differential t \bar{t} forward-backward asymmetry, and
leads to an excess of massive boosted di-jet events, which may be linked to the
recent findings of the CDF collaboration. This feature may be observed by
looking at the corresponding planar flow distribution, which is presented here.

review the basics of D-instantons, which can generate superpotential
corrections to charged matter couplings forbidden by the global $U(1)$

the purpose of studying the landscape, we discuss certain advantages of
studying quiver gauge theories which arise from type II orientifold

mathematical biology, climate change, human physiology and economics. Therefore
it is highly desirable to find early-warning signs. We show that it is possible
to classify critical transitions by using bifurcation theory and normal forms
in the singular limit. Based on this elementary classification, we analyze
stochastic fluctuations and calculate scaling laws of the variance of
stochastic sample paths near critical transitions for fast subsystem
bifurcations up to codimension two. The theory is applied to several models:
the Stommel-Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation from geoscience,
an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive network, an activator-inhibitor
switch from systems biology, a predator-prey system from ecology and to the
Euler buckling problem from classical mechanics. For the Stommel-Cessi model we
compare different detrending techniques to calculate early-warning signs. In
the epidemics model we show that link densities could be better variables for
prediction than population densities. The activator-inhibitor switch
demonstrates effects in three time-scale systems and points out that excitable
cells and molecular units have information for subthreshold prediction. In the
predator-prey model explosive population growth near a codimension two
bifurcation is investigated and we show that early-warnings from normal forms
can be misleading in this context. In the biomechanical model we demonstrate
that early-warning signs for buckling depend crucially on the control strategy
near the instability which illustrates the effect of multiplicative noise.

in the bulk, the excited Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are gauge fields and the four
dimensional theory is gauge invariant only if the compactification is carried
out by using curvatures as fundamental objects. The four dimensional theory is
governed by two types of gauge transformations, one determined by the KK zero
modes of the gauge parameters and the other by the excited ones. Within this
context, a gauge-fixing procedure to quantize the KK modes that is covariant
under the first type of gauge transformations is shown and the ghost sector
induced by the gauge-fixing functions is presented. If the gauge parameters are
confined to the usual four dimensional space-time, the known result in the

that the excited KK modes are not gauge fields, but matter fields transforming
under the adjoint representation of $SU_4(N)$. A calculation of the one-loop

are free of ultraviolet divergences and well-behaved at high energies.

substructure mass fractions within projected radii of 3% of the host halo
virial radius is approximately fsub ~ 0.25%, but that the variance is large
with a 95-percentile range of 0 <= fsub <= 1%. We quantify possible effects of
substructure on quadruply-imaged lens systems using the cusp relation and the
simple statistic, Rcusp. We estimate that the probability of obtaining the
large values of the Rcusp which have been observed from substructure effects is
roughly ~10^-3 to ~10^-2. We consider a variety of possible correlations
between host halo properties and substructure properties in order to probe
possible sample biases. In particular, low-concentration host dark matter halos
have more large substructures and give rise to large values of Rcusp more
often. However, there is no known observational bias that would drive observed
quadruply-imaged quasars to be produced by low-concentration lens halos.
Finally, we show that the substructure mass fraction is a relatively reliable
predictor of the value of Rcusp.

correlations among the variables, not those introduced by the observational
selection effects, before obtaining the individual distributions of the
variables. We use the methods developed by Efron and Petrosian which are
designed to obtain unbiased correlations, distributions, and evolution with
redshift from a data set truncated due to observational biases. It is found
that the population of quasars exhibits strong positive correlation between the
radio and optical luminosities. With this correlation, whether intrinsic or
observationally induced accounted for, we find that there is a strong
luminosity evolution with redshift in both wavebands, with significantly higher
radio than optical evolution. We also construct the local radio and optical
luminosity functions and the density evolution. Finally, we consider the
distribution of the radio loudness parameter R obtained from careful treatment
of the selection effects and luminosity evolutions with that obtained from the
raw data without such considerations. We find a significant difference between
the two distributions and no clear sign of bi-modality in the true distribution
for the range of R values considered. Our results indicate therefore, somewhat
surprisingly, that there is no critical switch in the efficiency of the
production of disk outflows/jets between very radio quiet and very radio loud
quasars, but rather a smooth transition. Also, this efficiency seems higher for
the high-redshift and more luminous sources in the considered sample.

the {\Sugma}3(111) tilt grain boundary, when combined with a vacancy of
vanishing formation energy, can trap up to nine H atoms per (1x1) unit in (111)

that a cleavage along the GB is already exothermic. At high temperature, this
effect can be still significant. For an infinitely large dislocation loop in
(100) plane, four H can be trapped per (1x1) unit even above room temperature,
incurring a decohesion strong enough to break the crystal. Our numerical
results demonstrate unambiguously the grain boundaries and dislocation loops
can serve as precursors of H blistering. In addition, no H2 molecules can be
formed in either environment before fracture of W bonds starts, well explaining
the H blistering in the absence of voids during non-damaging irradiation.

precursor of H blistering in single crystalline W (SCW) during H isotope

bond-breaking of metal atoms presents a challenge to measure. Using density
functional theory, we have calculated the formation energy of a vacancy and a
self-interstitial atom (SIA) in supersaturated defect-free SCW with various H
concentrations. When the ratio of H:W exceeds 1:2, the formation of both
vacancies and self-interstitials becomes exothermic, meaning that spontaneous
formation of micro-voids which can accommodate molecular H2 will occur.
Molecular H2 is not allowed to form, and it is not needed either at the very
initial stage of H blistering in SCW. With supersaturated H, the free volume at
the vacancy or SIA is greatly smeared out with severe lattice distortion and
more H can be trapped than in the dilute H case.

establish a strong relation between the discrete problem and its continuous

$\alpha$-approximation algorithm for the continuous relaxation implies a
randomized $(\alpha - \eps)$-approximation algorithm for the discrete problem.
We use this relation to improve the best known approximation ratio for the
problem to $1/4- \eps$, for any $\eps > 0$, and to obtain a nearly optimal
$(1-e^{-1}-\eps)-$approximation ratio for the monotone case, for any $\eps>0$.
We further show that the probabilistic domain defined by a continuous solution
can be reduced to yield a polynomial size domain, given an oracle for the

first order. Therefore, there are two critical end points, i.e, $T_{CEP}^{u,d}$
and $T_{CEP}^{s}$ at finite density. We also explain the feature of
$T_c^{\chi}=T_c^{\cal D}$ in the case of 1st and 2nd order phase transitions,
and $T_c^{\chi}<T_c^{\cal D}$ in the case of crossover, and expect this feature

stronger-than-classical correlations, and there exists a broad class of

principle of information causality has been suggested to distinguish quantum
theory from these nonphysical theories, together with an elegant
information-theoretic proof of the quantum bound of two-particle correlations.
In this work, we extend this to genuine $N$-particle correlations that cannot
be reduced to mixtures of states in which a smaller number of particles are
entangled. We first express Svetlichny's inequality in terms of multipartite
no-signaling boxes, then prove that the strongest genuine multipartite
correlations lead to the maximal violation of information causality. The
maximal genuine multipartite correlations under the constraint of information
causality is found to be equal to the quantum mechanical bound. This result
consolidates information causality as a physical principle defining the
possible correlations allowed by nature, and provides intriguing insights into
the limits of genuine multipartite correlations in quantum theory.

  $\Psi$-rings can be thought of as functors from the category with one object

the elastic scattering up to the neutron incident energy $E_n=65$ MeV are well
reproduced without reinforcing fss2 with the three-body force. The vector
analyzing-power of the neutron, $A_y(\theta)$, in the energy region $E_n$ < 25
MeV is largely improved in comparison with the predictions by the
meson-exchange potentials, thus yielding a partial solution of the
long-standing $A_y$-puzzle owing to the nonlocality of the short-range
repulsion produced by the quark-model baryon-baryon interaction. The large
Coulomb effect in the vector and tensor analyzing-powers in $E_n$ < 10 MeV is
also analyzed based on the Vincent and Phatak method and recent detailed
studies by other authors.

classification and regression approaches such as support vector machines have
widely been used in remote sensing as well as in various civil engineering
applications. In spite of their better performance with different datasets,
support vector machines still suffer from shortcomings such as
visualization/interpretation of model, choice of kernel and kernel specific

are another kernel based approach being explored for classification and

machines over the support vector machines is the availability of probabilistic

the loss of entanglement generated caused by the Unruh effect. It is
interesting to note that the sudden death of entanglement disappears for any

ESD in non-inertial frames due to the presence of quantum memory. Furthermore,
the degree of entanglement is enhanced as we increase the degree of memory and

the centimeter free-free continuum emissions in this region. The comparisons of
the molecular line emissions with the free--free continuum emissions reveal a
0.5 pc scale massive molecular envelope which is being partially dispersed by
the dynamically-expanding bipolar ionized cavity. The massive envelope is
rotationally flattened and has an enhanced molecular density in the mid-plane.
In the center of this massive clump lies a compact ($<$0.1 pc) hot
($\gtrsim$100 K) toroid, in which a cluster of O--type stars has formed. This
overall geometry is analogous to the standard core collapse picture in the
low-mass star forming region, with a central (proto-)stellar object, a disk, an
envelope, and a bipolar outflow and outflow cavity. However, G10.6-0.4 has a
much larger physical size scale ($\le$0.1 pc for typical low--mass star forming
core). Based on the observations, we propose a schematic picture of the OB
cluster forming region, which incorporates the various physical mechanisms.
This model will be tested with the observations of other embedded OB clusters,
