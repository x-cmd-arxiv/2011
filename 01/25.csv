color center. Theoretical calculations of optimal structures show that these
devices can simultaneously enhance optical pumping by a factor of 7,
spontaneous emission rates by Fp ~ 50 (Purcell factor), and offer collection
efficiencies up to 40%. These excitation and collection enhancements occur over
a broad range of wavelengths (~30nm), and are independently tunable with device
geometry, across the excitation (~530nm) and emission (~600-800nm) spectrum of
the NV center. Implementing this system with top-down techniques in bulk
diamond crystals will provide a scalable architecture for a myriad of diamond

that of the status of the wave function of a system in a quantum universe. Is
the wave function objective or subjective? Does it represent the physical state
of the system or merely our information about the system? And if the former,
does it provide a complete description of the system or only a partial
description? We shall address these questions here mainly from a Bohmian
perspective, and shall argue that part of the difficulty in ascertaining the
status of the wave function in quantum mechanics arises from the fact that
there are two different sorts of wave functions involved. The most fundamental
wave function is that of the universe. From it, together with the configuration
of the universe, one can define the wave function of a subsystem. We argue that
the fundamental wave function, the wave function of the universe, has a
law-like character.

This necessitates the introduction of the dataset as a random effect. In this
context, extending a work of Lee et al. (2003), a method is proposed to select
relevant variables among tens of thousands in a probit mixed regression model,
considered as part of a larger hierarchical Bayesian model. Latent variables
are used to identify subsets of selected variables and the grouping (or
blocking) technique of Liu (1994) is combined with a Metropolis-within-Gibbs
algorithm (Robert and Casella 2004). The method is applied to a merged dataset
made of three individual gene expression datasets, in which tens of thousands
of measurements are available for each of several hundred human breast cancer
samples. Even for this large dataset comprised of around 20000 predictors, the
method is shown to be efficient and feasible. As an illustration, it is used to
select the most important genes that characterize the estrogen receptor status

to walk along microtubules processively by hydrolyzing ATP. Its neck linkers,
which connect the two motor domains and can undergo a docking/undocking
transition, are widely believed to play the key role in the coordination of the
chemical cycles of the two motor domains and, consequently, in force production
and directional stepping. Although many experiments, often complemented with
partial kinetic modeling of specific pathways, support this idea, the ultimate
test of the viability of this hypothesis requires the construction of a
complete kinetic model. Considering the two neck linkers as entropic springs
that are allowed to dock to their head domains and incorporating only the few
most relevant kinetic and structural properties of the individual heads, here
we develop the first detailed, thermodynamically consistent model of kinesin
that can (i) explain the cooperation of the heads (including their gating
mechanisms) during walking and (ii) reproduce much of the available
experimental data (speed, dwell time distribution, randomness, processivity,
hydrolysis rate, etc.) under a wide range of conditions (nucleotide
concentrations, loading force, neck linker length and composition, etc.).
Besides revealing the mechanism by which kinesin operates, our model also makes
it possible to look into the experimentally inaccessible details of the
mechanochemical cycle and predict how certain changes in the protein affect its
motion.

billiard are studied. The system is described in terms of a four-dimensional
nonlinear mapping. Dissipation is introduced via inelastic collisions of the
particle with the boundary, thus implying that the particle has a fractional
loss of energy upon collision. The dissipation causes profound modifications in
the dynamics of the particle as well as in the phase space of the non
dissipative system. In particular, inelastic collisions can be assumed as an
efficient mechanism to suppress Fermi acceleration of the particle. The
dissipation also creates attractors in the system, including chaotic. We show
that a slightly modification of the intensity of the damping coefficient yields
a drastic and sudden destruction of the chaotic attractor, thus leading the
system to experience a boundary crisis. We have characterized such a boundary
crisis via a collision of the chaotic attractor with its own basin of
attraction and confirmed that inelastic collisions do indeed suppress Fermi
acceleration in two-dimensional time dependent billiards.

CaFe2As2 single crystals grown out of excess FeAs to annealing / quenching
temperature. Whereas crystals that are annealed at 400 C exhibit a first order
phase transition from a high temperature tetragonal to a low temperature
orthorhombic and antiferromagnetic state near 170 K, crystals that have been
quenched from 960 C exhibit a transition from a high temperature tetragonal
phase to a low temperature, non-magnetic, collapsed tetragonal phase below 100
K. By use of temperature dependent electrical resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility, X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic
resonance measurements we have been able to demonstrate that the transition
temperature can be reduced in a monotonic fashion by varying the annealing /
quenching temperature from 400 to 850 C with the low temperature state
remaining antiferromagnetic for transition temperatures larger than 100 K and
becoming collapsed tetragonal / non-magnetic for transition temperatures below
90 K. This suppression of the orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic phase transition
and its ultimate replacement with the collapsed tetragonal / non-magnetic phase
is similar to what has been observed for CaFe2As2 under hydrostatic pressure.
Transmission electron microscopy studies indicate that there is a temperature
dependent, width of formation of CaFe2As2 with a decreasing amount of excess Fe
and As being soluble in the single crystal at lower annealing temperatures. For
samples quenched from 960 C there is a fine (of order 10 nm), semi-uniform
distribution of precipitate that can be associated with an average strain field
whereas for samples annealed at 400 C the excess Fe and As form mesoscopic
grains that induce little strain throughout the CaFe2As2 lattice.

variables $Y$ and $Z$ conditionally on an arbitrary third random variable $X$.
%with $F_{.|.}$ representing conditional distribution functions, The partial
copula is introduced, defined as the joint distribution of $U=F_{Y|X}(Y|X)$ and
$V=F_{Z|X}(Z|X)$. We call this transformation of $(Y,Z)$ into $(U,V)$ the
partial copula transform. It is easy to show that if $Y$ and $Z$ are continuous
for any given value of $X$, then $Y\ind Z|X$ implies $U\ind V$. Conditional
independence can then be tested by (i) applying the partial copula transform to
the data points and (ii) applying a test of ordinary independence to the
transformed data. In practice, $F_{Y|X}$ and $F_{Z|X}$ will need to be
estimated, which can be done by, e.g., standard kernel methods. We show that
under easily satisfied conditions, and for a very large class of test
statistics for independence which includes the covariance, Kendall's tau, and
Hoeffding's test statistic, the effect of this estimation vanishes
asymptotically. Thus, for large samples, the estimation can be ignored and we
have a simple method which can be used to apply a wide range of tests of
independence, including ones with consistency for arbitrary alternatives, to
test for conditional independence. A simulation study indicates good small
sample performance. Advantages of the partial copula approach compared to
competitors seem to be simplicity and generality.

pseudo-eigenmodes easily reach an upper bound of growth rate in terms of the
logarithmic norm of the involved nonnormal operators, thus exhibiting feedback

information dissemination between agents moving independently on a plane.
Formally, we consider $k$ mobile agents performing independent random walks on
an $n$-node grid. At time $0$, each agent is located at a random node of the
grid and one agent has a rumor. The spread of the rumor is governed by a
dynamic communication graph process ${G_t(r) | t \geq 0}$, where two agents are
connected by an edge in $G_t(r)$ iff their distance at time $t$ is within their
transmission radius $r$. Modeling the physical reality that the speed of radio
transmission is much faster than the motion of the agents, we assume that the
rumor can travel throughout a connected component of $G_t$ before the graph is
altered by the motion. We study the broadcast time $T_B$ of the system, which
is the time it takes for all agents to know the rumor. We focus on the sparse
case (below the percolation point $r_c \approx \sqrt{n/k}$) where, with high
probability, no connected component in $G_t$ has more than a logarithmic number
of agents and the broadcast time is dominated by the time it takes for many
independent random walks to meet each other. Quite surprisingly, we show that
for a system below the percolation point the broadcast time does not depend on
the relation between the mobility speed and the transmission radius. In fact,
we prove that $T_B = \tilde{O}(n / \sqrt{k})$ for any $0 \leq r < r_c$, even
when the transmission range is significantly larger than the mobility range in
one step, giving a tight characterization up to logarithmic factors. Our result
complements a recent result of Peres et al. (SODA 2011) who showed that above

standing puzzle. Resolving it is especially important in astrophysics when the
flow angular momentum profile is Keplerian which forms an accretion disk having
negligible molecular viscosity. Hence, any viscosity in such systems must be
due to turbulence, arguably governed by magnetorotational instability
especially when temperature T >~ 10^5. However, such disks around quiescent
cataclysmic variables, protoplanetary and star-forming disks, the outer regions
of disks in active galactic nuclei are practically neutral in charge because of
their low temperature, and thus expected not to be coupled with the magnetic
field appropriately to generate any transport due to the magnetorotational
instability. This flow is similar to plane Couette flow including the Coriolis
force, at least locally. What drives their turbulence and then transport, when
such flows do not exhibit any unstable mode under linear hydrodynamic
perturbation? We demonstrate that the threedimensional secondary disturbance to
the primarily perturbed flow triggering elliptical instability may generate
significant turbulent viscosity ranging 0.0001 <~ \nu_t <~ 0.1 to explain

sequence of dense subspaces $(D_n : n\in\omega)$ one can pick finite
(respectively, one-point) subsets $F_n\subset D_n$ such that
$\bigcup_{n\in\omega}F_n$ is dense in $X$. These properties are much stronger
than separability, but are equivalent to it in the presence of certain
convergence properties. For example, we show that every Hausdorff separable
radial space is R-separable and note that neither separable sequential nor
separable Whyburn spaces have to be selectively separable. A space is called
\emph{d-separable} if it has a dense $\sigma$-discrete subspace. We call a
space $X$ D-separable if for every sequence of dense subspaces $(D_n :
n\in\omega)$ one can pick discrete subsets $F_n\subset D_n$ such that
$\bigcup_{n\in\omega}F_n$ is dense in $X$. Although $d$-separable spaces are
often also $D$-separable (this is the case, for example, with linearly ordered
$d$-separable or stratifiable spaces), we offer three examples of countable
non-$D$-separable spaces. It is known that d-separability is preserved by
arbitrary products, and that for every $X$, the power $X^{d(X)}$ is
d-separable. We show that D-separability is not preserved even by finite
products, and that for every infinite $X$, the power $X^{2^{d(X)}}$ is not
D-separable. However, for every $X$ there is a $Y$ such that $X\times Y$ is
D-separable. Finally, we discuss selective and D-separability in the presence
of maximality. For example, we show that (assuming ${\mathfrak d}=\mathfrak c$)
there exists a maximal regular countable selectively separable space, and that
(in ZFC) every maximal countable space is D-separable (while some of those are
not selectively separable). However, no maximal space satisfies the natural
game-theoretic strengthening of D-separability.

which capture intuitive notions like being larger or being more variable. This
paper introduces stochastic ordering of instantaneous SNRs of fading channels
as a tool to compare the performance of communication systems over different
channels. Stochastic orders unify existing performance metrics such as ergodic
capacity, and metrics based on error rate functions for commonly used
modulation schemes through their relation with convex, and completely monotonic
(c.m.) functions. Toward this goal, performance metrics such as instantaneous
error rates of M-QAM and M-PSK modulations are shown to be c.m. functions of
the instantaneous SNR, while metrics such as the instantaneous capacity are
seen to have a completely monotonic derivative (c.m.d.). It is shown that the
commonly used parametric fading distributions for modeling line of sight (LoS),
exhibit a monotonicity in the LoS parameter with respect to the stochastic
Laplace transform order. Using stochastic orders, average performance of
systems involving multiple random variables are compared over different
channels, even when closed form expressions for such averages are not
tractable. These include diversity combining schemes, relay networks, and
signal detection over fading channels with non-Gaussian additive noise, which
are investigated herein. Simulations are also provided to corroborate our

implemented in previous literature to conclude that entropy of exons is higher

define a new approximation to topological entropy free from the aforementioned

relativistic viscous fluid dynamical description of the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) with a microscopic Boltzmann cascade for the late hadronic rescattering
stage, yields an excellent description of charged and identified hadron spectra
and elliptic flow measured in 200 A GeV Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). Using initial conditions that incorporate
event-by-event fluctuations in the initial shape and orientation of the
collision fireball and values eta/s for the specific shear viscosity of the
quark-gluon plasma that were recently extracted from the measured centrality
dependence of the eccentricity-scaled, p_T-integrated charged hadron elliptic
flow, we obtain universally good agreement between theory and experiment for
the p_T-spectra and differential elliptic flow v_2(p_T) for both pions and
protons at all collision centralities.

evolution are derived for spherical components. With the exception of nearly
equal-mass binaries, binary asteroid systems are in the midst of lengthy tidal
evolutions, far from their fully synchronous tidal end states. Calculations of
material strength indicate that binaries in the main belt with 100-km-scale
primary components are consistent with being made of monolithic or fractured
rock as expected for binaries likely formed from sub-catastrophic impacts in
the early solar system. To tidally evolve in their dynamical lifetime,
near-Earth binaries with km-scale primaries or smaller must be much weaker
mechanically than their main-belt counterparts even if formed in the main belt
prior to injection into the near-Earth region. Small main-belt binaries with
primary components less than 10 km in diameter, depending on their ages, could
either be as strong as large main-belt binaries or as weak as near-Earth
binaries because the inherent uncertainty in the age of a binary system can
affect the calculation of material strength by orders of magnitude. Several
other issues are considered, though these typically affect the calculation of
material strength by no more than a factor of two. We also find indirect
evidence within all three groups of binary asteroids that the inter-component
separation may evolve via another mechanism(s) with the binary YORP effect
being a likely candidate.

MAGIC detection coincides with high energy MeV/GeV gamma-ray activity measured
by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi satellite. The VHE

can be well described by a power law dN/dE \propto E^-Gamma with a photon index

(4.56+/-0.46)x10^(-10) cm^-2 s^-1 (~1 Crab Nebula flux). The VHE flux measured
by MAGIC varies significantly within the 30 min exposure implying a flux
doubling time of about 10 min. The VHE and MeV/GeV spectra, corrected for the
absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL), can be described by a
single power law with photon index 2.72+/-0.34 between 3 GeV and 400 GeV, and
is consistent with emission belonging to a single component in the jet. The
absence of a spectral cutoff constrains the gamma-ray emission region outside
the Broad Line Region, which would otherwise absorb the VHE gamma-rays.
Together with the detected fast variability, this challenges present emission
models from jets in FSRQ. Moreover, the combined Fermi/LAT and MAGIC spectral
data yield constraints on the density of the Extragalactic Background Light in
the UV-optical to near-infrared range that are compatible with recent models.

emission and magnetic fields in an unbiased sample of 12 Local Group (LG)
irregular and dwarf irregular galaxies with the 100m Effelsberg telescope at
2.64 and 4.85GHz. Magnetic fields in LG dwarfs are three times weaker than in
the normal spirals (<4.2+-1.8muG). The production of total magnetic fields
appears to be regulated mainly by the star-formation surface density, with the
power-law exponent of 0.30+-0.04, or by the gas surface density (with the
exponent 0.47+-0.09). In addition, we find systematically stronger fields in
objects of higher global star-formation rate. The dwarf galaxies follow a
similar far-infrared relationship (with a slope of 0.91+-0.08) to that
determined for high surface brightness spiral galaxies. The magnetic field
strength in dwarf galaxies does not correlate with their maximum rotational
velocity, indicating a small-scale rather than a large-scale dynamo process. If
magnetization of the Universe by galactic outflows is coeval with its metal
enrichment, we show that more massive objects (such as Lyman Break Galaxies)
can efficiently magnetize the intergalactic medium with a magnetic field
strength of about 0.8nG out to a distance of 160-530kpc at redshifts 5-3,
respectively. Several times weaker fields and shorter magnetization distances
are expected from primordial dwarf galaxies. We also predict that most
star-forming local dwarfs might have magnetized their surroundings up to about
0.1muG within about 5kpc distance. Strong magnetic fields (>6muG) are observed
only in dwarfs of extreme characteristics while typical LG dwarfs are
unsuitable objects for the efficient supply of magnetic fields to the
intergalactic medium.

nearly simultaneous spectra from 0.48 to 2.4 microns acquired with HIRES and
NIRSPEC on Keck and SpeX on the IRTF, we find significant excess continuum
emission throughout this region, including the I, Y, and J bands, which are
usually thought to diagnose primarily photospheric emission. The IYJ excess
correlates with the excess in the V band, attributed to accretion shocks in the
photosphere, and the excess in the K band, attributed to dust in the inner disk
near the dust sublimation radius, but it is too large to be an extension of the
excess from these sources. The spectrum of the excess emission is broad and
featureless, suggestive of blackbody radiation with a temperature between 2200
and 5000 K. The luminosity of the IYJ excess is comparable to the accretion
luminosity inferred from modeling the blue and ultraviolet excess emission and
may require reassessment of disk accretion rates. The source of the IYJ excess
is unclear. In stars of low accretion rate, the size of the emitting region is
consistent with cooler material surrounding small hot accretion spots in the
photosphere. However, for stars with high accretion rates, the projected area
is comparable to or exceeds that of the stellar surface. We suggest that at
least some of the IYJ excess emission arises in the dust-free gas inside the

bulge formation regulate each other. That is, black holes and bulges
""coevolve"". Therefore, reports of a similar correlation between black holes and
the dark matter halos in which visible galaxies are embedded have profound
implications. Dark matter is likely to be nonbaryonic, so these reports suggest
that unknown, exotic physics controls black hole growth. Here we show - based
in part on recent measurements of bulgeless galaxies - that there is almost no
correlation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unless
the galaxy also contains a bulge. We conclude that black holes do not correlate
directly with dark matter. They do not correlate with galaxy disks, either.
Therefore black holes coevolve only with bulges. This simplifies the puzzle of
their coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in the
galaxy mergers that make bulges.

dramatically over the last ~8 Gyr. This result points to a major re-think of
the processes dominating the latetime evolution of galaxies. In this paper we
present the first estimates for the scale sizes of brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) in the redshift range 0.8 < z < 1.3 from an analysis of deep Hubble
Space Telescope imaging, comparing to a well matched local sample taken from
the Local Cluster Substructure Survey at z ~ 0.2. For a small sample of 5 high
redshift BCGs we measure half-light radii ranging from 14 - 53 kpc using de
Vaucuoleurs profile fits, with an average determined from stacking of 32.1 \pm
2.5 kpc compared to a value 43.2 \pm 1.0 kpc for the low redshift comparison
sample. This implies that the scale sizes of BCGs at z = 1 are ~ 30% smaller
than at z = 0.25. Analyses comparing either Sersic or Petrosian radii also
indicate little or no evolution between the two samples. The detection of only
modest evolution at most out to z = 1 argues against BCGs having undergone the
large increase in size reported for massive galaxies since z = 2 and in fact
the scale-size evolution of BCGs appears closer to that reported for radio
galaxies over a similar epoch. We conclude that this lack of size evolution,
particularly when coupled with recent results on the lack of BCG stellar mass
evolution, demonstrates that major merging is not an important process in the
late time evolution of these systems. The homogeneity and maturity of BCGs at z

Hubble Ultra Deep Field as a source image, to produce realistic simulated
lensed images. We compare the lensed arc statistics measured from the
simulations to those of a sample of 45 X-ray selected clusters, observed with
the Hubble Space Telescope, that we have analysed in Horesh et al. (2010). The
observations and the simulations are matched in cluster masses, redshifts,
observational effects, and the algorithmic arc detection and selection. At
z=0.6 there are too few massive-enough clusters in the Millennium volume for a
proper statistical comparison with the observations. At redshifts 0.3<z<0.5,
however, we have large numbers of simulated and observed clusters, and the
latter are an unbiased selection from a complete sample. For these redshifts,
we find excellent agreement between the observed and simulated arc statistics,
in terms of the mean number of arcs per cluster, the distribution of number of
arcs per cluster, and the angular separation distribution. At z ~ 0.2 some
conflict remains, with real clusters being ~3 times more efficient arc
producers than their simulated counterparts. This may arise due to selection
biases in the observed subsample at this redshift, to some mismatch in masses
between the observed and simulated clusters, or to physical effects that arise
at low redshift and enhance the lensing efficiency, but which are not
represented by the simulations.

massive stars and stellar clusters remains elusive. In the past decade,
compelling evidence has emerged that suggests Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) may
be precursors to stellar clusters. However, the usual method for identifying
IRDCs is biased by the requirement that they are seen in absorption against
bright mid-IR emission, whereas dust continuum observations allow cold, dense
pre-stellar-clusters to be identified anywhere. Aims: We aim to understand what
physical properties characterize IRDCs, to explore the population of dust
continuum sources that are not IRDCs, and to roughly characterize the star
formation activity in dust continuum sources. Results: We present temperature
and column density maps in the Hi-GAL l=30 and l=59 SDP fields, as well as a
robust algorithm for cirrus subtraction and source identification using Hi-GAL.
We report on the fraction of Hi-GAL sources which are mid-IR-dark, -neutral, or
-bright in both fields. We find significant trends in column density and
temperature between mid-IR-dark and -bright pixels; mid-IR-dark pixels are
about 10 K colder and have a factor of 2 higher column density on average than
mid-IR-bright pixels. We find that Hi-GAL dust continuum sources span a range
of evolutionary states from pre- to star-forming, and that warmer sources are
associated with more star formation tracers. There is a trend of increasing
temperature with tracer type from mid-IR-dark at the coldest, to outflow/maser
sources in the middle, and finally to 8 and 24 micron bright sources at the
warmest. Finally, we identify five candidate IRDC-like sources on the far-side
of the Galaxy. These are cold (~ 20 K), high column density (N(H2) > 10^22
cm^-2) clouds identified with Hi-GAL which, despite bright surrounding mid-IR
emission, show little to no absorption at 8 micron. (abridged)

hundred gamma ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshift reveal ubiquitous soft
X-ray absorption. The directly measured optical depth \tau at a given observed
energy is found to be constant on average at redshift z > 2, i.e., <\tau (0.5
keV) >_{z > 2} = 0.40+/- 0.02. Such an asymptotic optical depth is expected if
the foreground diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) dominates the absorption
effect, and if the metallicity of the diffuse IGM reaches ~ 0.2 - 0.4 solar at
z = 0. To further test the IGM absorption hypothesis, we analyze the 12 highest
S/N (> 5000 photon) z > 2 quasar spectra from the XMM-Newton archive, which are
all extremely radio loud (RLQs). The quasar optical depths are found to be
consistent with the mean GRB value. The four lowest-z quasars (2 < z < 2.5),
however, do not show significant absorption. The best X-ray spectra of
radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) at z > 2 provide only upper limits to the
absorption, which are still consistent with the RLQs, albeit with much lower
S/N (< 1000 photons at z ~ 4). Lack of quasar absorption poses a challenge to
the smooth IGM interpretation, and could allude to the opacity being rather due
to the jets in RLQs and GRBs. However, the jet absorbing column would need to
appear in RLQs only at z > 2.5, and in GRBs to strongly increase with z in
order to produce the observed tendency to a constant mean \tau. High X-ray
spectral resolution can differentiate between an absorber intrinsic to the
source that produces discernible spectral lines, and the diffuse IGM that
produces significant absorption, but no discrete features.

way to reduce the region to a single point by a sequence of sweeps? The problem
of sweeping points by orthogonal sweeps was first studied in [2]. Here we
consider the following \emph{slanted} variant of sweeping recently introduced
in [1]: In a single sweep, the sweep-line is placed at a start position
somewhere in the plane, then moved continuously according to a sweep vector
$\vec v$ (not necessarily orthogonal to the sweep-line) to another parallel end
position, and then lifted from the plane. The cost of a sequence of sweeps is
the sum of the lengths of the sweep vectors. The (optimal) sweeping cost of a
region is the infimum of the costs over all finite sweeping sequences for that
region. An optimal sweeping sequence for a region is one with a minimum total
cost, if it exists. Another parameter of interest is the number of sweeps.
  We show that there exist convex regions for which the optimal sweeping cost
cannot be attained by two sweeps. This disproves a conjecture of Bousany,
Karker, O'Rourke, and Sparaco stating that two sweeps (with vectors along the
two adjacent sides of a minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram) always
suffice [1]. Moreover, we conjecture that for some convex regions, no finite
sweeping sequence is optimal. On the other hand, we show that both the 2-sweep
algorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing rectangle and the 2-sweep

that bond swapping, SrF + SrF $\rightarrow$ Sr$_2$ + F$_2$, is energetically
forbidden at these temperatures. Rather, the only energetically allowed
reaction is SrF + SrF $\rightarrow$ SrF$_2$ + Sr, and even then only singlet
states of the SrF$_2$ trimer can form. A calculation along a reduced reaction

by one SrF molecule ""handing off"" a fluorine atom to the other molecule.

inventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives according to a
Poisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by
the retailer (such as price adjustment, sales commission, advertisement
intensity, etc.). The relationship between the action and the demand rate is
not known in advance. However, the retailer is able to learn the optimal action
""on the fly"" as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on the observed
demand reactions.
  Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic
""learning-while-doing"" algorithm that only involves function value estimation
to achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs a series of
shrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices within that interval
using a set of carefully chosen parameters. We prove that the convergence rate
of our algorithm is among the fastest of all possible algorithms in terms of
asymptotic ""regret"" (the relative loss comparing to the full information
optimal solution). Our result closes the performance gaps between parametric
and non-parametric learning and between a post-price mechanism and a
customer-bidding mechanism. Important managerial insight from this research is
that the values of information on both the parametric form of the demand
function as well as each customer's exact reservation price are less important
than prior literature suggests. Our results also suggest that firms would be
better off to perform dynamic learning and action concurrently rather than
sequentially.

contrast to known W[1] hardness of related problems. Without the size bound,
Downey et al.[2003] proved that the minimum k-way cut problem is W[1] hard in k
even for simple unweighted graphs. Downey et al. asked about the status for
planar graphs. Our result implies tractability in k for the planar graphs since
the minimum k-way cut of a planar graph is of size at most 6k (more generally,
we get tractability in k for any graph class with k-way cuts of size limited by
is a function of k, e.g., bounded degree graphs, or simple graphs with an
excluded minor). A simple reduction shows that vertex cuts are at least as hard
as edge cuts, so the minimum k-way vertex cut is also W[1] hard in terms of k.
Marx [2004] proved that finding a minimum k-way vertex cut of size s is also
W[1] hard in s. Marx asked about the FPT status with edge cuts, which we prove

  quantum--classical transition","04 pages and 02 figures. Submitted for publication",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the fundamental problems with the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,
according to Bohr, is the fact that ""our usual description of physical
phenomena is based entirely on the idea that the phenomena concerned may be
observed without disturbing them appreciably"". Furthermore in his articles
discussing the subject Bohr argues that the action of the probe will be
affected by the system and inasmuch the system will be affected by the probe.
Specifically in Gedanken experiments he tests the wave-particle duality of the
system and implicitly assumes that the probe is also a quantum system. A
universal character can only be attributed to Quantum Mechanics provided a
complementarity relation is also valid for the probe. As a consequence the
state system-probe becomes entangled. In the past fourty years complementarity
tests have been proposed. However, much less attention has been paid to the
study of an arbitrary probe system. In the present contribution, we fill in
this gap and show that the key ingredient for the quantum-classical transition
is not necessarily the information generated by the system-probe interaction
but rather by its accessibility. Our results have been successfully tested in
the interferometric experiment. Our results also allow for a simple physical
interpretation of the physics of Ramsey Zones where one photon (average)
interacts with a two level atom in a classical manner, i.e., no entanglement is
generated.

the last century. Despite that the Lebesgue integral is complete and has many
good properties, its inability to integrate all derivatives prompted the
introduction of new approaches - Denjoy, Perron and others introduced new ways
of integration aimed at preserving the good properties of the Lebesgue integral
but extending the set of functions to which it could be applied. The goal was
achieved but neither of the new approaches was elegant or simple or
transparent. In the 50s a new integral was introduced, independently by
Kurzweil and Henstock,in a very simple, Riemann like way, but it turned out
that it was more powerful than the Lebesgue integral. There are many names
attached to this integral, I will use here the name Henstock integral. The goal
of this article is to introduce the generalized Riemann integral and the

43GHz. This sample is selected from the high-frequency Australia Telescope
20GHz (AT20G) survey and consists of all sources with S_{20GHz}>40mJy in an
equatorial field of the ACT survey. For a subset of 25 of these sources we used
the GBT to obtain 90GHz data. The goals of this program are: 1) a
characterization of the spectra, polarization and variability of high
frequency-selected radio sources; 2) extrapolating from the few GHz regime to
the ~150GHz regime of the ACT survey, allowing for more accurate removal of the
radio source signal in our particular field; and 3) providing a data set that
will allow more accurate modeling of the high-frequency radio source
contamination in current and future SZ and CMB experiments. We find that, as
expected, this sample consists of flatter spectrum and more compact or
point-like sources than low frequency-selected samples. In the K-band,
variability is typically <~20%, although there are exceptions. The higher
frequency data is well suited to the detection of extreme Giga-Hertz Peak
spectrum Sources (GPS). The inclusion of the 43GHz data causes the relative
fraction of inverted spectrum sources to go down and of peaked spectrum sources
to go up when compared with the AT20G survey results. The trend largely
continues with the inclusion of the 90GHz data, although ~10% of the sources
with GBT data show a spectral upturn from 43GHz to 90GHz. The measured
polarization fractions are typically <5%, although in some cases they are
measured to be up to ~20%. For the ~40% of the sample with detected polarized
flux in all four bands, the polarization fractions typically increase with
frequency. This trend is stronger for steeper spectrum sources as well as for
the lower flux density sources.

states in the anisotropic PC can be expressed as a superposition of four
dressed states analytically. Through detuning two allowed atomic transition
energies with respect to the photonic band edge, the coupling between these two
transitions leads to three dynamic regimes, namely non-Markovian decay, damped
quantum interference and quantum interference, classified by the numbers of
contributed bounded dressed states. From the degree of quantum interference of
two atomic transitions, we found the energy exchange between the atom and PC
reservoir is the lowest as the excited states become degenerate but with
maximum quantum interference when the atom is prepared at one of the excited
states. The results also show that excited states prefer to stay out of phase
at all detuning energy except for near degenerate. Therefore, we can control
the spontaneous emission rate not only by the amount of detuning frequencies
but also the relative phase of initial states.

two-level systems (qubits) is fundamental to quantum information science and
its applications. Decoherence of a quantum superposition state arises from the
interaction between the constituent system and the uncontrolled degrees of
freedom in its environment. Within the standard Bloch-Redfield picture of
two-level system dynamics, qubit decoherence is characterized by two rates: a
longitudinal relaxation rate Gamma1 due to the exchange of energy with the
environment, and a transverse relaxation rate Gamma2 = Gamma1/2 + Gamma_phi
which contains the pure dephasing rate Gamma_phi. Irreversible energy
relaxation can only be mitigated by reducing the amount of environmental noise,
reducing the qubit's internal sensitivity to that noise, or through multi-qubit
encoding and error correction protocols (which already presume ultra-low error
rates). In contrast, dephasing is in principle reversible and can be refocused
dynamically through the application of coherent control pulse methods. In this
work we demonstrate how dynamical-decoupling techniques can moderate the
dephasing effects of low-frequency noise on a superconducting qubit with
energy-relaxation time T1 = 1/Gamma1 = 12 us. Using the CPMG sequence with up
to 200 pi-pulses, we demonstrate a 50-fold improvement in the transverse
relaxation time T2 over its baseline value. We observe relaxation-limited times
T2(CPMG) = 23 us = 2 T1 resulting from CPMG-mediated Gaussian pure-dephasing
times in apparent excess of 100 us. We leverage the filtering property of this
sequence in conjunction with Rabi and energy relaxation measurements to
facilitate the spectroscopy and reconstruction of the environmental noise power

field expressions, when expressed with respect to the time retarded position of
the charge. A straightforward transformation from the instantaneous rest frame,
using relativistic Doppler factors, yields expressions of the electromagnetic
fields for the charge moving with an arbitrary velocity. The field expressions
are derived without using Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials, thereby avoiding
evaluation of any spatial or temporal derivatives of these potentials at the
retarded time.

constrain the growth rate of large-scale structure formation. Usually, future

been made with a full 2D power spectrum characterized as function of wavenumber
$k$ and directional cosine $\mu$ between line-of-sight direction and wave

analysis reveals that compared to the analysis with full 2D spectrum, a partial
information from the monopole and quadrupole spectra generally degrades the
constraints by a factor of $\sim1.3$ for each parameter. The additional
information from the hexadecapole spectrum helps to improve the constraints,

tone-hole lattice. Benade proposed a practical definition using the measurement
of the input impedance, for which at least two frequency bands appear. The
first one is a stop band, while the second one is a pass band. The value of
this frequency, which is a global quantity, depends on the whole geometry of
the instrument, but is rather independent of the fingering. This seems to
justify the consideration of a woodwind with several open holes as a periodic
lattice. However the holes on a clarinet are very irregular. The paper
investigates the question of the acoustical regularity: an acoustically regular
lattice of tone holes is defined as a lattice built with T-shaped cells of
equal eigenfrequencies. Then the paper discusses the possibility of division of
a real lattice into cells of equal eigenfrequencies. It is shown that it is not
straightforward but possible, explaining the apparent paradox of Benade's
theory. When considering the open holes from the input of the instrument to its
output, the spacings between holes are enlarged together with their radii: this
explains the relative constancy of the eigenfrequencies.

population of chains which are updated by local moves and global moves, also
called equi-energy jumps. The state space is partitioned into energy rings, and
the current state of a chain can jump to a past state of an adjacent chain that
has energy level close to its level. This algorithm has been developed to
facilitate global moves between different chains, resulting in a good
exploration of the state space by the target chain. This method seems to be
more efficient than the classical Parallel Tempering (PT) algorithm. However it
is difficult to use in combination with a Gibbs sampler and it necessitates
increased storage. In this paper we propose an adaptation of this EES that
combines PT with the principle of swapping between chains with same levels of
energy. This adaptation, that we shall call Parallel Tempering with Equi-Energy
Moves (PTEEM), keeps the original idea of the EES method while ensuring good
theoretical properties, and practical implementation even if combined with a

the EES and of the standard PT algorithms in the context of mixture models, and
in a problem of identification of gene regulatory binding motifs.

three aspects is carried out for the class of variable coefficient
(1+1)-dimensional nonlinear telegraph equations with coefficients depending on
the space variable. The usual equivalence group and the extended one including
transformations which are nonlocal with respect to arbitrary elements are first
constructed. Then using the technique of variable gauges of arbitrary elements
under equivalence transformations, we restrict ourselves to the symmetry group
classifications for the equations with two different gauges g=1 and g=h. In
order to get the ultimate classification, the method of furcate split is also
used and consequently a number of new interesting nonlinear invariant models
which have non-trivial invariance algebra are obtained. As an application,
exact solutions for some equations which are singled out from the
classification results are constructed by the classical Lie reduction. The
classification of nonclassical symmetries for the classes of differential
equations with gauge g=1 is discussed within the framework of singular
reduction operator. Using the direct method, we also carry out two
classifications of local conservation laws up to equivalence relations

play the major role for simple and clear formulation of the final results.

We observe that persistence acts as an excellent quantifier to describe this

not change with feedback) as a reference point, we compute number of sites
which have been greater than (less than) the fixed point till time t. Though
local dynamics is high-dimensional in this case this definition of persistence
which tracks a single variable is an excellent quantifier for this transition.

N(O VI)~14.5 for galaxies covering the range -1.6<[O/H]<0. In intergalactic
environments [log N(H I)<17], the mean O VI component column density measured
in datasets of similar sensitivity shows only weak evolution between z=0.2 and
z=2.3, but IGM O VI components are on average almost twice as broad at z=0.2
than at z=2.3. The existence of a characteristic value of log N(O VI) for
galactic O VI absorbers, and the lack of evolution in log N(O VI) for
intergalactic absorbers, lend support to the ``cooling-flow' model of Heckman
et al. (2002), in which all O VI absorbers are created in regions of
initially-hot shock-heated plasma that are radiatively cooling through coronal
temperatures. These regions could take several forms, including conductive,
turbulent, or shocked boundary layers between warm (~10^4 K) clouds and hot
(~10^6 K) plasma, although many such regions would have to be intersected by a
typical galaxy-halo sightline to build up the characteristic galactic N(O VI).
The alternative, widely-used model of single-phase photoionization for
intergalactic O VI is ruled out by kinematic evidence in the majority of IGM O
VI components at low and high redshift.

excited (the twist components), in addition to the four standard flexion

most quantitative descriptions of city traffic so far are based on computer

into units of single vehicles is necessary to obtain realistic fluctuations in
the traffic variables, and how this can be implemented in a fluid-dynamic

requirement of individual route assignments. Combining both methods allows us
to study a variety of different simulation scenarios. These reveal fundamental
relationships between the average flow, the average density, and the
variability of the vehicle densities. Considering the inhomogeneity of traffic
as an independent variable can eliminate the scattering of congested flow
measurements. The variability also turns out to be a key variable of urban
traffic performance. Our results can be explained through the number of full

the case of gravity and reparametrization invariant systems, the latter of

diffeomorphism and reparametrization symmetry, respectively. This has severe
implications, as these symmetries determine the dynamics of the corresponding

reparametrization invariance is necessarily also discretization independent and
therefore uniquely determined by the corresponding continuum quantum mechanical
propagator. We use this insight to develop an iterative method for constructing
such a discretized path integral, akin to a Wilsonian RG flow. This allows us
to address the problem of discretization ambiguities and of an anomaly--free
path integral measure for such systems. The latter is needed to obtain a path

systems, the most likely companion is a white dwarf, with minimum masses of
~0.2 Solar Masses. The other pulsar, J1731-1847, has a very low mass companion
and exhibits eclipses, and is thus a member of the ""black widow"" class of
pulsar binaries. These eclipses have been observed in bands centred near
frequencies of 700, 1400 and 3000 MHz, from which measurements have been made
of the electron density in the eclipse region. These measurements have been

properties of this source are used to perform a comparison with the other known

mismatch in the ferromagnetic electrode may mimic a spin active barrier.
Indeed, in the $s$-wave case we show that under suitable conditions the spin
dependent conductance of minority carriers below the energy gap $\Delta_0$ can
be larger than for majority carriers, and lower above $\Delta_0$. On the other
hand, for a d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconductor similar spin-dependent effects give
rise to an asymmetric peak splitting in the conductance. These results suggest
that the junction may work as a spin-filtering device.

concept for hidden communication in telecommunication networks. In MLS, at
least two steganographic methods are utilised simultaneously, in such a way
that one method (called the upper-level) serves as a carrier for the second one
(called the lower-level). Such a relationship between two (or more) information
hiding solutions has several potential benefits. The most important is that the
lower-level method steganographic bandwidth can be utilised to make the
steganogram unreadable even after the detection of the upper-level method:
e.g., it can carry a cryptographic key that deciphers the steganogram carried
by the upper-level one. It can also be used to provide the steganogram with
integrity. Another important benefit is that the lower-layer method may be used
as a signalling channel in which to exchange information that affects the way
that the upper-level method functions, thus possibly making the steganographic
communication harder to detect. The prototype of MLS for IP networks was also
developed, and the experimental results are included in this paper.

the distant Universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherent
changes in the observed number density of the background sources. Depending on
the slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes a
correlation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpected
in the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.
Previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered by
small number statistics. The large number of sources detected in the {\it
Herschel} Multi-tiered Extra-galactic Survey (HerMES) Lockman-SWIRE field
enables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation between
sub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. Using ancillary data we compile
two low-redshift samples from SDSS and SWIRE with <z> ~ 0.2 and 0.4,
respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux density
and colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. We detect
cross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clear
evidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. A small, but
non-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due to
the tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping with
those of the foreground samples.

faced during the elaboration of this kind of semantics is to characterize
definable strategies, that is strategies which actually behave like a proof.
This is usually done by restricting the model to strategies satisfying subtle
combinatorial conditions, whose preservation under composition is often
difficult to show. Here, we present an original methodology to achieve this
task, which requires to combine advanced tools from game semantics, rewriting
theory and categorical algebra. We introduce a diagrammatic presentation of the
monoidal category of definable strategies of our model, by the means of
generators and relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set
of atomic strategies and the equality between strategies admits a finite
axiomatization, this equational structure corresponding to a polarized
variation of the notion of bialgebra. This work thus bridges algebra and
denotational semantics in order to reveal the structure of dependencies induced
by first-order quantifiers, and lays the foundations for a mechanized analysis

the capacity of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) amplify-and-forward relay
channel, assuming source-relay channel mean feedback at the source. The
challenge here is that relaying introduces a nonconvex structure in the
objective function, thereby excluding the possible use of previous methods
dealing with mean feedback that generally rely on the concavity of the
objective function. A novel method is employed, which divides the feasible set
into two subsets and establishes the optimum from one of them by comparison. As
such, the optimization is transformed into the comparison of two nonnegative
random variables in the Laplace transform order, which is one of the important
stochastic orders. It turns out that the optimum transmission strategy is to
transmit along the known channel mean and its orthogonal eigenchannels. The
condition for rank-one precoding (beamforming) to achieve capacity is also
determined. Our results subsume those for traditional MISO precoding with mean
feedback.

thus it may not be sensible to decide to accept or reject a model based solely
on whether the evidence ratio reaches some threshold value. The odds suggested
by the evidence ratio bear no obvious relationship to the power or Type I error
rate of a test based on the evidence ratio. The general performance of such
tests is strongly affected by the signal to noise ratio in the data, the
assumed priors, and the threshold in the evidence ratio that is taken as
`decisive'. The comprehensiveness of the model suite under consideration is
also very important. The usefulness of the evidence ratio approach in a given

by the hairpin formation in biochemistry. Hairpin formations occur naturally

regular language is linear context-free, but not regular, in general. However,
for some time it is was open whether the regularity of the hairpin completion
of a regular language is is decidable. In 2009 this decidability problem has

detect the first astronomical sources of TeV neutrinos will be dramatically
increased. While the theoretical estimates of the neutrino fluxes contain large
uncertainties, we can formulate the conditions for the detectability of certain
neutrino sources phenomenologically. In fact, since most galactic neutrino
sources are transparent for TeV gamma-rays, their detectability implies a
minimum flux of the accompanying gamma-rays. For a typical energy-dependence of
detection areas of km**3 volume neutrino detectors, we obtain the quantitative
condition I_gamma(20 TeV)>2*10^-15 ph/(cm**2 s), that thanks to the
normalization of the gamma-ray spectrum at 20 TeV appears to be quite robust,
i.e. almost independent of the shape of energy spectrum of neutrinos. We remark
that this condition is satisfied by the young supernova remnants RX
J1713.7-3946 and RX J0852.0-4622 (Vela Jr) - two of the strongest galactic
gamma-ray sources. The preliminary condition for the detectability of high

way to test this hypothesis for RX J1713.7-3946 is proposed. Finally, we assess
the relevance of a neutrino detector located in the Northern Hemisphere for the

merging of plasmoids and fragmentation in the current sheet in the standard
flare model is presented. Then, using a 2.5-D electromagnetic particle-in-cell
model with free boundary conditions, these processes were modelled on the
kinetic level of plasma description. We recognized the plasmoids which mutually
interacted and finally merged into one large plasmoid. Between interacting
plasmoids further plasmoids and current sheets on smaller and smaller spatial
scales were formed in agreement with the fragmentation found in MHD
simulations. During interactions (merging - coalescences) of the plasmoids the
electrons were very efficiently accelerated and heated. We found that after a
series of such merging processes the electrons in some regions reached the
energies relevant for the emission in the hard X-ray range. Considering these
energetic electrons and assuming the plasma density 10^9-10^10 cm^{-3} and the
source volume as in the December 31, 2007 flare (Krucker at al. 2010, ApJ 714,

is observed, in agreement with cross-section transmission electron microscopy
measurements and photoluminescence experiments. The creation of a high density
plasma within the quantized structures is demonstrated by the observation of
coupled plasmon-phonon modes. The density of the plasma and thereby the
plasmon-phonon interaction is controlled with the excitation power. This work
represents a base for further studies on confined high density charge systems
in nanowires.

line can be seen as a special class of Markov random fields restricted to one
dimension. Non stationary reciprocal processes have been extensively studied in
the past especially by Jamison, Krener, Levy and co-workers. The specialization
of the non-stationary theory to the stationary case, however, does not seem to
have been pursued in sufficient depth in the literature. Stationary reciprocal
processes (and reciprocal stochastic models) are potentially useful for
describing signals which naturally live in a finite region of the time (or
space) line. Estimation or identification of these models starting from
observed data seems still to be an open problem which can lead to many
interesting applications in signal and image processing. In this paper, we
discuss a class of reciprocal processes which is the acausal analog of
auto-regressive (AR) processes, familiar in control and signal processing. We
show that maximum likelihood identification of these processes leads to a
covariance extension problem for block-circulant covariance matrices. This
generalizes the famous covariance band extension problem for stationary
processes on the integer line. As in the usual stationary setting on the
integer line, the covariance extension problem turns out to be a basic
conceptual and practical step in solving the identification problem. We show
that the maximum entropy principle leads to a complete solution of the problem.

The problem is to show that general (upper semi-continuous) subsolutions
restrict to satisfy the same constraints. We first prove an elementary result
which, in theory, can be applied to any subequation. Then two definitive
results are obtained. The first applies to any ""geometrically defined""
subequation, and the second to any subequation which can be transformed to a
constant coefficient (i.e., euclidean) model. This provides a long list of
geometrically and analytically interesting cases where restriction holds.

one-particle Schr\""odinger operators with random Zeeman interactions. These
operators arise as follows: Static spins are placed randomly on the sites of a
simple cubic lattice according to a site percolation process with density x and
coupled to one another ferromagnetically. Scattering of an electron in a
conduction band at these spins is described by a random Zeeman interaction term
that originates from indirect exchange. It is shown rigorously that, for
positive values of x below the percolation threshold, the spectrum of the
one-electron Schr\""odinger operator near the band edges is dense pure-point,
and the corresponding eigenfunctions are exponentially localized.
  Localization near the band edges persists in a weak external magnetic field,
H, but disappears gradually, as H is increased. Our results lead us to predict
the phenomenon of colossal (negative) magnetoresistance and the existence of a
Mott transition, as H and/or x are increased.
  Our analysis is motivated directly by experimental results concerning the
magnetic alloy Eu_x Ca_1-x B_6.

revealed broad iron K_alpha emission lines, some relativistically blurred. For
galactic black hole X-ray binaries XMM-Newton spectra during hard state also
reveal the presence of a relativistic iron emission line and a thermal
component, interpreted as an indication for a weak inner cool accretion disk
underneath a hot corona. These thermal components were found after the
transition from soft to hard spectral state and can be understood as sustained
by re-condensation of gas from an advection-dominated flow (ADAF) onto the
disk. In view of the similarity of accretion flows around stellar mass and
supermassive black holes we discuss whether the broad iron emission lines in
Seyfert 1 AGN can be understood as arising from a similar accretion flow
geometry. We derive Eddington-scaled accretion rates for Seyfert galaxies with
strong lines in samples of Miller (2007) and Nandra et al. (2007). For the
evaluation we use the observed X-ray luminosity, bolometric corrections and
black hole masses from literature, most values taken from Fabian and Vasudevan
(2009). Rates derived are less than 0.1 of the Eddington rate for more than
half of the sources. For 10^7 to 10^8 solar mass black holes in Seyfert 1 AGN
this limit corresponds to 0.01 to 0.2 solar masses per year. Our investigation
shows that for quite a number of Seyfert AGN in hard spectral state iron
emission lines can arise from an inner weak disk surrounded by an ADAF as
predicted by the re-condensation model. Some of the remaining sources with
higher accretion rates may be in a spectral state comparable to the ""very high""
state of LMXBs. (abridged)
