find considerable difference in dynamics between the non-Markovian cases and
its Markovian counterparts. We also calculate the time-dependent transport
current through the QPC which contains information about the measured NMR
system. We find an extra transient current term proportional to the expectation
value of the symmetrized product of the position and momentum operators of the
NMR. This extra current term, with a coefficient coming from the combination of
the imaginary parts of the QPC reservoir correlation functions, has a
substantial contribution to the total transient current in the non-Markovian
case, but was generally ignored in the studies of the same problem in the
literature. Considering the contribution of this extra term, we show that a
significantly qualitative and quantitative difference in the total transient

approach is based on constructing iteration-free methods based on special
schemes of splitting into subdomains. Such regionally-additive schemes are
constructed using the general theory of additive operator-difference schemes.
There are employed the analogues of classical schemes of alternating direction
method, locally one-dimensional schemes, factorization methods, vector and
regularized additive schemes. The main results were obtained here for
time-dependent problems with self-adjoint elliptic operators of second order.
  The paper discusses the Cauchy problem for the first order evolutionary
equations with a nonnegative not self-adjoint operator in a finite-dimensional

operators of decomposition which preserve nonnegativity for the individual
operator terms of splitting. Unconditionally stable additive schemes of domain
decomposition were constructed using the regularization principle for
operator-difference schemes. Vector additive schemes were considered, too. The

uniquely determined because of several reasons. Apart from the ambiguity in the
choice of the quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations,
there also exists certain freedom in the choice of field: one can scale it
arbitrarily absorbing background functions, which are spatially homogeneous but
depend on time. Each nontrivial scaling turns out into a different dynamics
and, in general, into an inequivalent quantum field theory. In this work we
analyze this freedom at the quantum level for a scalar field in a
nonstationary, homogeneous spacetime whose spatial sections have $S^3$
topology. A scaling of the configuration variable is introduced as part of a
linear, time dependent canonical transformation in phase space. In this
context, we prove in full detail a uniqueness result about the Fock
quantization requiring that the dynamics be unitary and the spatial symmetries
of the field equations have a natural unitary implementation. The main
conclusion is that, with those requirements, only one particular canonical
transformation is allowed, and thus only one choice of field-momentum pair (up
to irrelevant constant scalings). This complements another previous uniqueness
result for scalar fields with a time varying mass on $S^3$, which selects a
specific equivalence class of Fock representations of the canonical commutation
relations under the conditions of a unitary evolution and the invariance of the
vacuum under the background symmetries. In total, the combination of these two
different statements of uniqueness picks up a unique Fock quantization for the
system. We also extend our proof of uniqueness to other compact topologies and
spacetime dimensions.

written as a (3+1)-dimensional BPS Skyrme model, in which the Skyrme field is
coupled to an infinite tower of vector mesons. Truncating this tower to a
single vector meson yields an extension of the standard Skyrme model to a
theory of pions coupled to the rho meson, with the significant simplification
that no additional free parameters are introduced. The present paper is
concerned with this truncated theory and results are presented for Skyrmions
with baryon numbers one to four. The approach involves the use of an extended
version of the Atiyah-Manton construction, in which the Skyrme field is
approximated by the holonomy of a Yang-Mills instanton. It is found that the
coupling to the rho meson significantly reduces Skyrmion binding energies, to
produce an improved comparison with the experimental data on nuclei. A
truncation that includes both a vector and an axial vector meson is also
investigated, providing a model of pions, the rho meson and the a1 meson.
Binding energies are further reduced by the inclusion of this additional meson,
shifting the Skyrmion energies a little closer to those of nuclei. Fixing the
energy unit by equating the energy of the baryon number four Skyrmion to the
He-4 mass, yields masses for all lower baryon numbers that are within 20 MeV of
the experimental values, which is an error that is four times smaller than in
the standard Skyrme model.

This work tests cloud-cloud collisions as the triggering mechanism for star
formation in the Serpens Main Cluster as has been suggested by previous work. A
set of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the collision
between two cylindrical clouds are performed and compared to (sub)millimetre

of the NW sub-cluster of Serpens can be reproduced only if there is a
pre-existing marginally gravitationally unstable region at the time the
collision occurs. This work supports the interpretation that a collision
between two clouds may have been the trigger of the most recent burst of star
formation in Serpens. It not only explains the complicated velocity structure
seen in the region, but also the temperature differences between the north (in
""isolated"" collapse) and the south (resulting from the shock between the
clouds). In addition it provides an explanation for the sources in the south
having a larger spread in age than those in the north.

classified via integer arithmetic and graph combinatorics. In particular, the
structure of the inverse map to such a monomial Cremona map is made very
explicit as is the degree of its monomial defining coordinates. As a special
case, one proves that any monomial Cremona map of degree 2 has inverse of
degree 2 if and only if it is an involution up to permutation in the source and
in the target. This statement is subsumed in a recent result of L. Pirio and F.
Russo, but the proof is entirely different and holds in all characteristics.
One unveils a close relationship binding together the normality of a monomial
ideal, monomial Cremona maps and Hilbert bases of polyhedral cones. The latter
suggests that facets of monomial Cremona theory may be NP-hard.

To be submitted",,,,"math.OC cs.MA cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we develop new methods for the analysis of decentralized
control systems and we apply them to formation control problems. The basic
set-up consists of a system with multiple agents corresponding to the nodes of
a graph whose edges encode the information that is available to the agents. We
address the question of whether the information flow defined by the graph is
sufficient for the agents to accomplish a given task. Formation control is
concerned with problems in which agents are required to stabilize at a given
distance from other agents. In this context, the graph of a formation encodes
both the information flow and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths
of the edges. A formation is said to be rigid if it cannot be continuously
deformed with the distance constraints satisfied; a formation is minimally
rigid if no distance constraint can be omitted without the formation losing its
rigidity. Hence, the graph underlying minimally rigid formation provides just
enough constraints to yield a rigid formation. An open question we will settle
is whether the information flow afforded by a minimally rigid graph is
sufficient to insure global stability. We show that the answer is negative in
the case of directed information flow. In this first part, we establish basic
properties of formation control in the plane. Formations and the associated
control problems are defined modulo rigid transformations. This fact has strong
implications on the geometry of the space of formations and on the feedback
laws, since they need to respect this invariance. We study both aspects here.
We show that the space of frameworks of n agents is CP(n-2) x (0,\infty). We
then illustrate how the non-trivial topology of this space relates to the
parametrization of the formation by inter-agent distances.

capture what agents with partial information can achieve by cooperating and
illustrate its use by deriving results about global stabilization of directed
formations. This framework underscores the need to differentiate the knowledge
an agent has about the task to accomplish from the knowledge an agent has about
the current state of the system. The control of directed formations has proven
to be more difficult than initially thought, as is exemplified by the lack of
global result for formations with n \geq 4 agents. We established in part I
that the space of planar formations has a non-trivial global topology. We
propose here an extension of the notion of global stability which, because it
acknowledges this non-trivial topology, can be applied to the study of
formation control. We then develop a framework that reduces the question of
whether feedback with partial information can stabilize the system to whether
two sets of functions intersect. We apply this framework to the study of a
directed formation with n = 4 agents and show that the agents do not have
enough information to implement locally stabilizing feedback laws.
Additionally, we show that feedback laws that respect the information flow

the best of our knowledge, the question of interaction between chemotaxis and
reactions has not yet been addressed either analytically or numerically. We
consider a model with a single density function involving diffusion, advection,
chemotaxis, and absorbing reaction. The model is motivated, in particular, by
studies of coral broadcast spawning, where experimental observations of the
efficiency of fertilization rates significantly exceed the data obtained from
numerical models that do not take chemotaxis (attraction of sperm gametes by a
chemical secreted by egg gametes) into account. We prove that in the framework
of our model, chemotaxis plays a crucial role. There is a rigid limit to how
much the fertilization efficiency can be enhanced if there is no chemotaxis but
only advection and diffusion. On the other hand, when chemotaxis is present,
the fertilization rate can be arbitrarily close to being complete provided that
the chemotactic attraction is sufficiently strong. Moreover, an interesting
feature of the estimates on fertilization rate and timescales in the
chemotactic case is that they do not depend on the amplitude of the reaction

contained in these data is over 3.0 x10^6. We have developed a method of
combining the output of two variability tests in order to detect variability on

an even larger effect. We find no trends with depletion radius or depletion

physical structure alone is insufficient to fully constrain evolutionary state.
We are able to place tighter constraints on the radius at which C18O is
depleted than the absolute fraction of depletion. As the timeline of chemical
depletion depends sensitively on the fraction of depletion, this difficulty in
constraining depletion fraction makes comparison with other timescales, such as
the free-fall timescale, very difficult. Keywords: Stars:Formation --

characterize a large sample of FGs. In this paper we present the analysis of
the fossil system RX J105453.3+552102. Optical deep images were used for
studying the properties of the brightest group galaxy and for computing the
photometric luminosity function of the group. We have also performed a detail
dynamical analysis of the system based on redshift data for 116 galaxies. This
galaxy system is located at z=0.47, and shows a quite large line-of-sight
velocity dispersion \sigma_{v}~1000 km/s. Assuming the dynamical equilibrium,
we estimated a virial mass of M ~ 10^{15} h_{70} M_{\odot}. No evidence of
substructure was found within 1.4 Mpc radius. We found a statistically
significant departure from Gaussianity of the group members velocities in the
most external regions of the group. This could indicate the presence of
galaxies in radial orbits in the external region of the group. We also found
that the photometrical luminosity function is bimodal, showing a lack of M_{r}
~ -19.5 galaxies. The brightest group galaxy shows low Sersic parameter (n~2)
and a small peculiar velocity. Indeed, our accurate photometry shows that the
difference between the brightest and the second brightest galaxies is 1.9 mag
in the r-band, while the classical definition of FGs is based on a magnitude
gap of 2. We conclude that this fossil system does not follow the empirical
definition of FGs. Nevertheless, it is a massive, old and undisturbed galaxy
system with little infall of L^{*} galaxies since its initial collapse.

reached for a number of SPH particles approaching 10 millions (for a disc mass
of order 10 per cent of the central object mass), which would set the critical
cooling time for fragmentation at about $15\Omega^{-1}$, roughly a factor two
larger than previously thought. More in general, we discuss the extent to which
the large number of recent numerical results are reliable or not. We argue that
those results that pertain to the dynamics associated with gravitational
instabilities (such as the locality of angular momentum transport, and the
relationship between density perturbation and induced stress) are robust, while
those pertaining to the thermodynamics of the system (such as the determination

z~3 the majority of the bubbles around galaxies are old (ages >1Gyr), i.e. they
contain metals expelled by their progenitors at earlier times; their filling
factor increases with time reaching about 10% at z<2. The energy deposited by
these expanding shocks in the IGM is predominantly in kinetic form (mean energy
density of 1 \mu eV cm^-3, about 2-3 x the thermal one), which is rapidly
converted in disordered motions by instabilities, finally resulting in a fully
developed turbulent spectrum whose evolution is followed through a spectral
transfer function approach. The derived mean IGM turbulent Doppler parameter,
b_t, peaks at z~1 at about 1.5 km/s with maximum b_t = 25 km/s. The shape of
the b_t distribution does not significantly evolve with redshift but undergoes
a continuous shift towards lower b_t values with time, as a result of bubble
aging. We find also a clear trend of decreasing b_t with N_HI and a more
complex dependence on R_s resulting from the age spread of the bubbles. We have
attempted a preliminary comparison with the data, hampered by the scarcity of

help ruling out different classes of dark energy and modified gravity models.
We show that a scale-independent bias can be estimated to a few percent per

without the need of an external estimation. We find that the growth rate can be
constrained to within 2-4% for each $\Delta z=0.2$ redshift slice, while the

for determining the characteristics of the progenitor, and the information
contained in the opening angle gives insight into the relativistic outflow and
the total energy that is contained in the burst. Unfortunately, a confident
inference of the jet opening angle usually requires broadband measurement of
the afterglow of the GRB, from the X-ray down to the radio and from minutes to
days after the prompt gamma-ray emission, which may be difficult to obtain. For
this reason, very few of all detected GRBs have constrained jet angles. We
present an alternative approach to derive jet opening angles from the prompt
emission of the GRB, given that the GRB has a measurable Epeak and fluence, and
which does not require any afterglow measurements. We present the distribution
of derived jet opening angles for the first two years of the Fermi Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (GBM) operation, and we compare a number of our derived opening
angles to the reported opening angles using the traditional afterglow method.
We derive the collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy, E_{\gamma}, for GRBs with
redshift and find that some of the GRBs in our sample are inconsistent with a
proto-magnetar progenitor. Finally, we show that the use of the derived jet
opening angles results in a tighter correlation between the rest-frame Epeak
and E_{\gamma} than has previously been presented, which places long GRBs and
short GRBs onto one empirical power law.

dwarf galaxies has been probed -- spanning a range of over one million in mass
-- an important observational gap remains for galaxies of intermediate mass.
This gap covers K band magnitudes of approximately -16 > M_K > -18 (for which
dwarf galaxies have B--K ~ 2). On the high mass side of the gap are dwarf
elliptical (dE) galaxies, that are dominated by stars in their inner regions.
While the low mass side includes dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies that are dark
matter-dominated and ultra compact dwarf (UCD) objects that are star-dominated.
Evolutionary pathways across the gap have been suggested but remain largely
untested because the `gap' galaxies are faint, making dynamical measurements
very challenging. With long exposures on the Keck telescope using the ESI
instrument we have succeeded in bridging this gap by measuring the dynamical
mass for five dwarf galaxies with M_K ~ -17.5 (M_B ~ --15.5). With the
exception of our brightest dwarf galaxy, they possess relatively flat velocity
dispersion profiles of around 20 km/s. By examining their 2D scaling relations
and 3D fundamental manifold, we found that the sizes and velocity dispersions
of these gap galaxies reveal continuous trends from dE to dSph galaxies. We
conclude that low-luminosity dwarf elliptical galaxies are dominated by stars,
not by dark matter, within their half light radii. This finding can be
understood if internal feedback processes are operating most efficiently in gap
galaxies, gravitationally heating the centrally-located dark matter to larger
radii. Whereas external environmental processes, which can strip away stars,
have a greater influence on dSph galaxies resulting in their higher dark matter
fractions. Abridged.

outline a series of experiments performed in a wind tunnel with the purpose of
examining fluid-elastic instabilities. In particular, we examine the role of
in-plane tension induced rigidity and how it influences static divergence and
convected wave instabilities. The flow is characterised by Reynolds numbers of
order $10^5$-$10^6$ and we specifically examine a sheet with an aspect ratio of
$L/l=1.33$. A unique aspect of this present work, is the direct measurement of
the sheet's three-dimensional displacement through an optical tracking method
with a grid of passive markers placed on the sheet surface. We show the
evolution of the sheet surface from stability, through to divergence, and then
finally into flutter. The frequency composition of the flutter event shows
higher harmonic components that suggest significant nonlinearities. Tension
induced rigidity plays a crucial role in the response of the sheet to the fluid
in both postponing and suppressing instabilities.

Vela X-1, 4U 1538-52, SMC X-1, LMC X-4, Cen X-3, and Her X-1. In previous
studies to determine neutron star mass, the X-ray eclipse duration has been
approximated analytically by assuming the companion star is spherical with an
effective Roche lobe radius. We use a numerical code based on Roche geometry
with various optimizers to analyze the published data for these systems, which
we supplement with new spectroscopic and photometric data for 4U 1538-52. This
allows us to model the eclipse duration more accurately and thus calculate an
improved value for the neutron star mass. The derived neutron star mass also
depends on the assumed Roche lobe filling factor beta of the companion star,
where beta = 1 indicates a completely filled Roche lobe. In previous work a
range of beta between 0.9 and 1.0 was usually adopted. We use optical
ellipsoidal lightcurve data to constrain beta. We find neutron star masses of
1.77 +/- 0.08 M_{sun} for Vela X-1, 0.87 +/- 0.07 M_{sun} for 4U 1538-52

the sources have a spectroscopic redshifts. To extend our study to lower 70um
luminosities we perform a stacking analysis and we characterize the observed
L_24/(1+z) vs L_70/(1+z) correlation. Using spectral energy distribution
templates which best fit this correlation, we derive the IR luminosity of

(1+z)^1.0+/-0.9 combined with a density evolution proportional to

(ULIRGs: 10^12Lsun< LIR) account for ~49% and ~17% respectively of the total IR
LD of the Universe. Combined with previous results for galaxies at z<1.3 and

rate (SFR) of a galaxy, we study the evolution of the SFR density of the

the horizon, there are two solutions which behave differently at large distance
$r$. In the basic mode, the behavior of one of the solutions is
${{(-{r^2}+{t^2})}^{\frac{1-n}{2}}}$ where $n$ is dimension of space. These
solutions occur in an integral form. In addition, a main statement of the
article is that a field in a black hole decays at infinity according to a
universal law. An example of such a field is an eigentensor of the Einstein's
linear operator that corresponds to an eigenvalue different from Zero. Possible
applications to the stability of black holes of high dimension are discussed.
The analysis we present is of a small perturbation of space-time. The
perturbation analysis of higher order will appear in a sequel. We determine
perturbations of space-time in dimension 1+$n\ge$ 4 where the system of
equations is simplified to the Einstein's linear equation, a tensor
differential equation. The solutions are some integral transformations which in
some cases reduce to explicit functions. We perform some perturbation analysis
and we show that there exists no perturbation regular everywhere outside the
event horizon which is well behaved at the spatial infinity. This confirms the
uniqueness of vacuum space-time within the perturbation theory framework. Our
strategy for treating the stability problem is applicable to other space-times
of high dimension with a cosmological constant different from Zero.

important in magnetic fusion and in space and solar physics --- areas that have
so far provided the context for most of reconnection research. Importantly,
these environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy
always stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new
direction of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy
astrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,
where radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the
pressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED
reconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative
cooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme
end, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main
astrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields
(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares
and magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs. Here, magnetic
energy density is so high that its dissipation heats the plasma to MeV
temperatures. Electron-positron pairs are then copiously produced, making the
reconnection layer highly collisional and dressing it in a thick pair coat that
traps radiation. The pressure is dominated by radiation and pairs. Yet,
radiation diffusion across the layer may be faster than the global Alfv\'en
transit time; then, radiative cooling governs the thermodynamics and
reconnection becomes a radiative transfer problem, greatly affected by the
ultra-strong magnetic field. This overall picture is very different from our
traditional picture of reconnection and thus represents a new frontier in
reconnection research.

broad and overlapping ice features is modeled, using calculated spectra of
giants, H2O ice and silicates. The adopted extinction curve is derived
empirically. Its high resolution allows for the separation of continuum and
feature extinction. The extinction between 13-25 um is ~50% relative to that at
2.2 um. The strengths of the 6.0 and 6.85 um absorption bands are in line with
those of YSOs. Thus, their carriers, which, besides H2O and CH3OH, may include
NH4+, HCOOH, H2CO and NH3, are readily formed in the dense core phase, before
stars form. The 3.53 um C-H stretching mode of solid CH3OH was discovered. The
CH3OH/H2O abundance ratios of 5-12% are larger than upper limits in the Taurus
molecular cloud. The initial ice composition, before star formation occurs,
therefore depends on the environment. Signs of thermal and energetic processing
that were found toward some YSOs are absent in the ices toward background
stars. Finally, the peak optical depth of the 9.7 um band of silicates relative
to the continuum extinction at 2.2 um is significantly shallower than in the
diffuse interstellar medium. This extends the results of Chiar et al. (2007) to
a larger sample and higher extinctions.

mixture requires that the bare interaction between bosons exceeds a critical
value, which is a universal function of the boson-fermion scattering length,
and exhibits a maximum in the unitary region. We calculate the quantum
depletion, momentum distribution and the boson contact parameter across the
resonance. The transition from condensate to molecular Fermi gas is also
discussed.

both localized and propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) -
quasiparticles in which photons are coupled to the quasi-free electrons of
metals. In particular, it allows for confining light in dimensions smaller than
the wavelength of photons in free space, and makes it possible to match the
different length scales associated with photonics and electronics in a single
nanoscale device. Broad applications of plasmonics have been realized including
biological sensing, sub-diffraction-limit imaging, focusing and lithography,
and nano optical circuitry. Plasmonics-based optical elements such as
waveguides, lenses, beam splitters and reflectors have been implemented by
structuring metal surfaces or placing dielectric structures on metals, aiming
to manipulate the two-dimensional surface plasmon waves. However, the abrupt
discontinuities in the material properties or geometries of these elements lead
to increased scattering of SPPs, which significantly reduces the efficiency of
these components. Transformation optics provides an unprecedented approach to
route light at will by spatially varying the optical properties of a material.
Here, motivated by this approach, we use grey-scale lithography to
adiabatically tailor the topology of a dielectric layer adjacent to a metal
surface to demonstrate a plasmonic Luneburg lens that can focus SPPs. We also
realize a plasmonic Eaton lens that can bend SPPs. Since the optical properties
are changed gradually rather than abruptly in these lenses, losses due to
scattering can be significantly reduced in comparison with previously reported
plasmonic elements.

Pound - Solomon scheme. We consider the general case of arbitrary orientation
of the cone axis relative the magnetic field. The BPP-Solomon scheme is shown
to remain valid for systems with the distribution of the cone axes depending
only on the tilt relative the magnetic field but otherwise being isotropic. We
consider the case of random isotropic orientation of cone axes relative the
magnetic field taking place in powders. Also we consider the case of their
predominant orientation along or opposite the magnetic field and that of their
predominant orientation transverse to the magnetic field which may be relevant
for, e.g., liquid crystals. Besides we treat in details the model case of the
cone axis directed along the magnetic field. The latter provides direct
comparison of the limiting case of our formulas with the textbook formulas for
ordinary isotropic rotational diffusion. We show that the present model enables
one to obtain naturally the well known power law for Larmor frequency
dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate. The latter is observed in some
complex systems. From this law the dependence of the fractional diffusion
coefficient on the fractional index is obtained to have a rather simple

our assumption that the Milky Way has a constant circular velocity of V_cir=250

advection, dispersion and kinetic sorption (adsorption/desorption). We start
considering the behavior of a single particle and apply a random walk to
describe advection/dispersion plus a Markov chain to describe kinetic sorption.
We show in a rigorous way that this model leads to a set of differential
equations. For this combination of stochastic processes such a derivation is
new. Then, to illustrate the mechanism that leads to non-Gaussian spreading we
analyze this set of equations at first leaving out the Gaussian dispersion term
(microdispersion). The set of equations now transforms to the telegrapher's
equation. Characteristic for this system is a longitudinal spreading, that
becomes Gaussian only in the long-time limit. We refer to this as kinetics
induced spreading. When the microdispersion process is included back again, the
characteristics of the telegraph equations are still present. Now two spreading
phenomena are active, the Gaussian microdispersive spreading plus the kinetics
induced non-Gaussian spreading. In the long run the latter becomes Gaussian as
well. Another non-Gaussian feature shows itself in the 2D situation. Here, the
lateral spread and the longitudinal displacement are no longer independent, as
should be the case for a 2D Gaussian spreading process. In a displacing plume
this interdependence is displayed as a `tailing' effect. We also analyze
marginal and conditional moments, which confirm this result. With respect to
effective properties (velocity and dispersion) we conclude that effective
parameters can be defined properly only for large times (asymptotic times). In
the two-dimensional case it appears that the transverse spreading depends on
the longitudinal coordinate. This results in `cigar-shaped' contours.

mass extrasolar planets with indirect methods (RV, photometry, astrometry). In
previous papers, using the Sun as a proxy, we investigated the impact of
stellar activity (spots, plages, convection) on the detectability of an
Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-type stars with RV
techniques. We extend here the detectability study to the case of astrometry.
We used the sunspot and plages properties recorded over one solar cycle to
infer the astrometric variations that a Sun-like star seen edge-on, 10 pc away,
would exhibit, if covered by such spots/bright structures. We compare the
signal to the one expected from the astrometric wobble (0.3 {\mu}as) of such a
star surrounded by a one Earth-mass planet in the HZ. We also briefly
investigate higher levels of activity. The activity-induced astrometric signal
along the equatorial plane has an amplitude of typ. less than 0.2 {\mu}as
(rms=0.07 {\mu}as), smaller than the one expected from an Earth-mass planet at
1 AU. Hence, for this level of activity, the detectability is governed by the
instrumental precision rather than the activity. We show that for instance a
one Earth-mass planet at 1 AU would be detected with a monthly visit during
less than 5 years and an instrumental precision of 0.8 {\mu}as. A level of
activity 5 times higher would still allow such a detection with a precision of
0.35 {\mu}as. We conclude that astrometry is an attractive approach to search
for such planets around solar type stars with most levels of stellar activity.

many-body tunneling theory for molecules decoupled from the STM substrate, and
we report on the use of standard quantum chemical methods to calculate the
quantities necessary to provide the 'correlated' STM molecular image. The
developed approach has been applied to eighteen different molecules, to explore
the effects of their chemical nature and of their substituents, as well as to
verify the possible contribution by transition metal centers. Whereas the bulk
of calculations have been performed with CISD because of the computational
cost, some tests have been also performed with the more accurate CCSD method to
quantify the importance of the computational level on many-body STM images. We
have found that correlation induces a remarkable squeezing of the images, and
that correlated images are not derived from Hartree-Fock HOMO or LUMO alone,
but include contributions from other orbitals as well. Although correlation
effects are too small to be resolved by present STM experiments for the studied
molecules, our results provide hints for seeking out other species with larger,
and possibly experimentally detectable, correlation effects.

were mainly influenced by several extremely successful space missions, the
predictions of theoretical models and the results of laboratory experiments.
However, novel computer models should not be treated in isolation but should be
based on experimental results. Therefore, a new experimental setup was
constructed to investigate the temperature dependent sublimation properties of
hexagonal water ice and the gas diffusion through a dry dust layer covering the
ice surface. We show that this experimental setup is capable to reproduce known
gas production rates of pure hexagonal water ice. The reduction of the gas
production rate due to an additional dust layer on top of the ice surface was
measured and compared to the results of another experimental setup in which the
gas diffusion through dust layers at room temperature was investigated. We
found that the relative permeability of the dust layer is inversely
proportional to its thickness, which is also predicted by theoretical models.
However, the measured absolute weakening of the gas flow was smaller than
predicted by models. This lack of correspondence between model and experiment
may be caused by an ill-determination of the boundary condition in the
theoretical models, which further demonstrates the necessity of laboratory
investigations. Furthermore, the impedance of the dust layer to the ice
evaporation was found to be similar to the impedance at room temperature, which
means that the temperature profile of the dust layer is not influencing the
reduction of the gas production. Finally, we present the results of an extended
investigation of the sublimation coefficient, which is an important factor for
the description of the sublimation rate of water ice and, thus, an important
value for thermophysical modeling of icy bodies in the solar system.

analytical, closed form solutions for the magnetoinductive waves transmitting

nonlinear magnetoiductive transmission line driven at one end by a relatively
weak electromotive force, can be modeled by coupled
resistive-inductive-capacitive (RLC) circuits with voltage-dependent
capacitance. Extended numerical simulations reveal that power transmission
along the array is also possible in other than the linear frequency bands,
which are located close to the nonlinear resonances of a single nonlinear RLC
circuit. Moreover, the effectiveness of power transmission for driving
frequencies in the nonlinear bands is comparable to that in the linear band.
Power transmission in the nonlinear bands occurs through the linear modes of
the system, and it is closely related to the instability of a mode that is
localized at the driven site.

optical flare and from December 2008 to April 2009 following an alert from the
Fermi space telescope on an exceptionally high gamma -ray state.
  Aims. The January 2007 observations resulted in a detection on January 16
with significance 5.2 sigma, corresponding to a F(> 150 GeV) (3.8 \pm 0.8)
\cdot 10^-11 ph cm^-2 s^-1 while the overall data sample does not show
significant signal. The December 2008 - April 2009 observations did not detect
the source. We study the multiwavelength behavior of the source at the epochs
of MAGIC observations, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at optical and X-ray
frequencies and for 2009 also gamma-ray data from Fermi.
  Methods. We study the light curves and spectral energy distribution of the
source. The spectral energy distributions of three observing epochs (including
the February 2006, which has been previously published in Albert et al. 2008a)
are modeled with one-zone inverse Compton models and the emission on January
16, 2007 also with two zone model and with a lepto-hadronic model.
  Results. We find that the VHE gamma-ray emission detected in 2006 and 2007
challenges standard one-zone model, based on relativistic electrons in a jet
scattering broad line region photons, while the other studied models fit the
observed spectral energy distribution more satisfactorily.

the Perfect codes, which are full-rate, full-diversity, information lossless

numerically. We extend our previous research of the transport of molecules
inside the uppermost layer of a cometary surface (Skorov and Rickmann, 1995;
Skorov et al. 2001). We assess the validity of the simplified capillary model
and its assumptions to simulate the gas flux trough the porous dust mantle as
it has been applied in cometary physics. A new microphysical computational
model for molecular transport in random porous media formed by packed spheres
is presented. The main transport characteristics such as the mean free path
distribution and the permeability are calculated for a wide range of model
parameters and compared with those obtained by more idealized models. The focus
in this comparison is on limitations inherent in the capillary model. Finally a
practical way is suggested to adjust the algebraic Clausing formula taking into
consideration the nonlinear dependence of permeability on layer porosity. The
retrieved dependence allows us to accurately calculate the permeability of
layers whose thickness and porosity vary in the range of values expected for
the near-surface regions of a cometary nucleus.

ML-decoding complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M\sqrt{M})$ (M=4) and is extremely hard
to obtain for larger QAM constellations. The proposed precoder's loss in error

system with few accessible states can not be separated in two distinct stages -
decoherence and thermalization. Finally, we turn to finite-size effects in the
time evolution of a single spin in the XY chain. We observe three consecutive
stages of the evolution: regular evolution, partial revivals, irregular
(apparently chaotic) evolution. The duration of the regular stage is
proportional to the number of spins in the chain. We observe a ""quiet and cold

spectra by properly taking into account adiabatic and radiative cooling effects
on the electron distribution. The synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton
(IC) scattering of various photons that are mainly produced in the accretion
disc and dusty torus are considered as radiation processes. We show that the
resultant radiation is dominated by the IC emission for compact sources (<
10kpc), whereas the synchrotron radiation is more important for larger sources.
We also compare the shell emissions with those expected from the lobe under the
assumption that a fractions of the energy deposited in the shell and lobe
carried by the non-thermal electrons are $\epsilon_e \sim 0.01$ and
$\epsilon_{e, lobe} \sim 1$, respectively. Then, we find that the shell
emissions are brighter than the lobe ones at infra-red and optical bands when
the source size is > 10kpc, and the IC emissions from the shell at > 10 GeV can
be observed with the absence of contamination from the lobe irrespective of the
source size. In particular, it is predicted that, for most powerful nearby

a cosmological-constant-like term is explicitly present as a non-vanishing
tension sigma on the brane, and an extra parameter alpha tunes the cross-over
scale r_c, the scale at which higher dimensional gravity effects become non
negligible. Since the Hubble parameter in this cosmology reproduces the same
LCDM expansion history, we study how upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as
Euclid and DES (Dark Energy Survey), can confirm or rule out this class of
models. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to determine the
parameters of the model, using Type Ia Supernov\ae, H(z) data, Gamma Ray Bursts
and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. We also fit the power spectrum of the
temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background to obtain the
correct normalisation for the density perturbation power spectrum. Then, we
compute the matter and the cosmic shear power spectra, both in the linear and
non-linear regimes. The latter is calculated with the two different approaches
of Hu and Sawicki (2007) (HS) and Khoury and Wyman (2009) (KW). With the eDGP
parameters coming from the Markov Chains, KW reproduces the LCDM matter power
spectrum at both linear and non-linear scales and the LCDM and eDGP shear
signals are degenerate. This result does not hold with the HS prescription:
Euclid can distinguish the eDGP model from LCDM because their expected power
spectra roughly differ by the 3sigma uncertainty in the angular scale range
700<l<3000; on the contrary, the two models differ at most by the 1sigma
uncertainty over the range 500<l<3000 in the DES experiment and they are

combine the allosteric Monod-Wyman- Changeux model for signal amplification by

Hyades cluster. However, recent analyses of the parallax distribution, of the
mass function, and of the action-space distribution of stream stars have shown
it to be rather composed of orbits trapped at a resonance of a density
disturbance. This resonant scenario should leave a clearly different signature
in the element abundances of stream stars than the dispersed cluster scenario,
since the Hyades cluster is chemically homogeneous. Here, we study the
metalllicty as well as the element abundances of Li, Na, Mg, Fe, Zr, Ba, La,
Ce, Nd, and Eu for a random sample of stars belonging to the Hyades stream, and
compare them with those of stars from the Hyades cluster. From this analysis:
(i) we independently confirm that the Hyades stream cannot be solely composed
of stars originating in the Hyades cluster; (ii) we show that some stars from
the Hyades stream nevertheless have abundances compatible with an origin in the
cluster; (iii) we emphasize that the use of Li as a chemical tag of the cluster
origin of main-sequence stars is very efficient in the range 5500 - 6200 K,
since the Li sequence in the Hyades cluster is very tight; (iv) we show that,
while this evaporated population has a metallicity excess of ~0.2 dex w.r.t.
the local thin disk population, identical to that of the Hyades cluster, the
remainder of the Hyades stream population has still a metallicity excess of
~0.06 to 0.15 dex, consistent with an origin in the inner Galaxy; (v) we show
that the Hyades stream can be interpreted as an inner 4:1 resonance of the
spiral pattern: this then also reproduces an orbital family compatible with the
Sirius stream, and places the origin of the Hyades stream up to 1 kpc inwards
from the solar radius, which might explain the observed metallicity excess of
the stream population.

the investigation of the thermal conductivity of porous dust aggregates provide
important knowledge about the influence of heating processes, like internal
heating by radioactive decay of short-lived nuclei, e.g. 26Al, on the evolution
and growth of planetesimals. The determination of the thermal conductivity was
performed by a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations.
An IR camera measured the temperature distribution of the sample surface heated
by a well-characterized laser beam. The thermal conductivity as free parameter
in the model calculations, exactly emulating the experiment, was varied until
the experimental and numerical temperature distributions showed best agreement.
Thus, we determined for three types of porous dust samples, consisting of
spherical, micrometer-sized SiO2 particles, with volume filling factors in the
range of 15% to 54%, the thermal conductivity to be 0.002 to 0.02 W/(m*K),
respectively. From our results, we can conclude that the thermal conductivity
mainly depends on the volume filling factor. Further investigations, which are
planned for different materials and varied contact area sizes (produced by
sintering), will prove the appropriate dependencies in more detail.

the planet host star is an evolved K-type star. In Hatzes et al. (2003) we

planet is slightly more massive and the orbit more circular than previous
results have suggested. An intensive high-cadence week of RV observations in

For x in Omega,
we denote by d_{S}(x) the number of members of S containing x. A long-standing

some x in Omega. We consider a related question. Define the weight of S to be
w(S)= \sum_{A in S} |A|. Suppose S is union-closed. How small can w(S) be?
Reimer showed that w(S) \geq |S| \log_{2} |S| /2, and that this inequality is
sharp. In this paper we show how his bound may be improved if we have some
additional information about the domain Omega of S: if S separates the points
of Omega, then w(S) \geq \binom{|\Omega|}{2}. This is stronger than Reimer's
Theorem when Omega > \sqrt{|S|\log_2 |S|}. In addition we construct a family of
examples showing the combined bound on w(S) is tight except in the region
|\Omega|=\Theta (\sqrt{|S|\log_2 |S|}), where it may be off by a multiplicative
factor of 2. Our proof also gives a lower bound on the average degree: if S is
a point-separating union-closed family, then the average degree over its domain
is at least 1/2 \sqrt{|S| \log_2 |S|}+ O(1), and this is best possible except
for a multiplicative factor of 2.

various spin orders. For a definite gauge, we find a double periodic solution,
where the conical spiral, in-plane spiral, helical, and ferromagnetic spin
orders become special cases, respectively. For another gauge, we obtain the
skyrmion-crystal solution. By simulating the influence of magnetic field and
temperature for our covariant model, we find a spontaneous formation of
skyrmion-fragment lattice and obtain a wider range of skyrmion-crystal phase in
comparison to the conventional Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya model.

regimes in Biotechnology, Genomics, and Nanotechnology. Complex regimes can
emerge when three independent sources of variance interact. In our model,
researchers can be considered as the nodes that carry the science system.
Research is geographically situated with site-specific skills, tacit knowledge
and infrastructures. Second, the emergent science level refers to the formal
communication of codified knowledge published in journals. Third, the
socio-economic dynamics indicate the ways in which knowledge production relates
to society. Although Biotechnology, Genomics, and Nanotechnology can all be
characterised by rapid growth and divergent dynamics, the regimes differ in
terms of self-organization among these three sources of variance. The scope of
opportunities for researchers to contribute within the constraints of the
existing body of knowledge are different in each field. Furthermore, the
relevance of the context of application contributes to the knowledge dynamics
to various degrees.

interested in gaining further insight into complex brain function and how it
changes across different mental states and disease conditions. Accurately
constructing these networks presents a daunting challenge given the
difficulties associated with accounting for inter-subject topological
variability. Viable approaches to this task must engender networks that capture
the constitutive topological properties of the group of subjects' networks that
it is aiming to represent. The conventional approach has been to use a mean or
median correlation network (Achard et al., 2006; Song et al., 2009) to embody a
group of networks. However, the degree to which their topological properties
conform with those of the groups that they are purported to represent has yet
to be explored. Here we investigate the performance of these mean and median
correlation networks. We also propose an alternative approach based on an
exponential random graph modeling framework and compare its performance to that
of the aforementioned conventional approach. Simpson et al. (2010) illustrated
the utility of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for creating brain
networks that capture the topological characteristics of a single subject's
brain network. However, their advantageousness in the context of producing a
brain network that ""represents"" a group of brain networks has yet to be
examined. Here we show that our proposed ERGM approach outperforms the
conventional mean and median correlation based approaches and provides an
accurate and flexible method for constructing group-based representative brain
networks.

We include the coupling between the unstable distortion modes and the
macroscopic strain tensor. We also analyze the symmetry of the dominantly
antiferromagnetic ordering which allows weak ferromagnetism. We show that in
this phase the weak ferromagnetic moment and the spontaneous ferroelectric
polarization are coupled, so that rotating one of these ordering by applying an
external electric or magnetic field one can rotate the other ordering. We
discuss the number of different domains (including phase domains) which exist
in each of the phases and indicate how these may be observed.

magnetic fields oriented parallel to the c-axis of the crystals. From the DC
magnetization loops and the AC susceptibility measurements, critical current
densities (Jc) were derived as a function of temperature and the DC and AC
magnetic fields. Results show that the substitution with carbon decreases Jc at
low magnetic fields, opposite to the well known effect of an increase of Jc at
higher fields. AC magnetic losses were derived from the AC susceptibility data
as a function of amplitude and the DC bias magnetic field. The AC losses were
determined for temperatures of 0.6 and 0.7 of the transition temperature Tc, so
close to the boiling points of LH2 and LNe, potential cooling media for

solve some important issues in the digital world, such as copyright protection,

based on vector quantization (VQ) have been presented. In this paper, we
present a new digital image watermarking method based on SOFM vector quantizer
for color images. This method utilizes the codebook partition technique in
which the watermark bit is embedded into the selected VQ encoded block. The
main feature of this scheme is that the watermark exists both in VQ compressed
image and in the reconstructed image. The watermark extraction can be performed
without the original image. The watermark is hidden inside the compressed
image, so much transmission time and storage space can be saved when the
compressed data are transmitted over the Internet. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method has robustness against various image
processing operations without sacrificing compression performance and the
computational speed.
