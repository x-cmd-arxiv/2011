photometric observations of cold interstellar clouds detected with the Planck
satellite. The three fields observed as part of the Herschel science
demonstration phase (SDP) provided the first glimpse into the nature of these
sources. We examine the properties of the dust emission within the fields. We
determine the dust sub-millimetre opacity, look for signs of spatial variations
in the dust spectral index, and estimate how the apparent variations of the
parameters could be affected by different sources of uncertainty. We use the
Herschel observations where the zero point of the surface brightness scale is
set with the help of the Planck satellite data. We derive the colour
temperature and column density maps of the regions and determine the dust
opacity by a comparison with extinction measurements. By simultaneously fitting
the colour temperature and the dust spectral index values we look for spatial
variations in the apparent dust properties. With a simple radiative transfer
model we estimate to what extent these can be explained by line-of-sight
temperature variations, without changes in the dust grain properties. The
analysis of the dust emission reveals cold and dense clouds that coincide with
the Planck sources and confirm those detections. The derived dust opacity
varies in the range kappa(250um) ~ 0.05-0.2 cm^2/g, higher values being
observed preferentially in regions of high column density. The average dust
spectral index beta is ~ 1.9-2.2. There are indications that beta increases
towards the coldest regions. The spectral index decreases strongly near
internal heating sources but, according to radiative transfer models, this can
be explained by the line-of-sight temperature variations without a change in

demonstrate that the theoretical stability properties are valid in practice

with state-of-the-art efficiency. The scheme's robustness is due to entropy
stability, positivity and properly discretised Powell terms. The implementation
takes the form of a modification of the MHD module in the FLASH code, an
adaptive mesh refinement code. We compare the new scheme with the standard
FLASH implementation for MHD. Results show comparable accuracy to standard
FLASH with the Roe solver, but highly improved efficiency and stability,
particularly for high Mach number flows and low plasma beta. The tests include
1D shock tubes, 2D instabilities and highly supersonic, 3D turbulence. We
consider turbulent flows with RMS sonic Mach numbers up to 10, typical of gas
flows in the interstellar medium. We investigate both strong initial magnetic
fields and magnetic field amplification by the turbulent dynamo from extremely
high plasma beta. The energy spectra show a reasonable decrease in dissipation
with grid refinement, and at a resolution of 512^3 grid cells we identify a
narrow inertial range with the expected power-law scaling. The turbulent dynamo
exhibits exponential growth of magnetic pressure, with the growth rate twice as
high from solenoidal forcing than from compressive forcing. Two versions of the
new scheme are presented, using relaxation-based 3-wave and 5-wave approximate
Riemann solvers, respectively. The 5-wave solver is more accurate in some

that flew aboard an atmospheric balloon. Because the discharge rate increased
as the balloon flew at higher altitude, he concluded in 1912 that the origin
could not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize
in 1936, and his experiment became legendary. At the same time, in 1911,
Pacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made a series of measurements to
determine the variation in the speed of discharge of an electroscope (and thus
the intensity of the radiation) while the electroscope was immersed in a box in
a sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay of Livorno (the Italian Navy supported
the research). Pacini discovered that the discharge of the oscilloscope was
significantly slower than at the surface.
  Before his conclusive measurements, Pacini performed a series of experiments
between 1907 and 1910, in particular by comparing radioactivity on ground and
on the sea surface a few kilometers off the coast. These experimennts gave
marginal indications on the presence of a non-terrestrial component,
encouraging Pacini to continue his research till the conclusive results. Such

ultra-deep narrow-band MUSYC image of the ECDF-S. We fit their stacked Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED) using Charlot & Bruzual templates. We consider star
formation histories parametrized by the e-folding time parameter tau, allowing
for exponentially decreasing (tau>0), exponentially increasing (tau<0), and
constant star formation rates. These LAEs are characterized by best fit
parameters and 68% confidence intervals of log(M_*/M_sun)=8.6[8.4-9.1],
E(B-V)=0.22[0.00-0.31], tau=-0.02[(-4)-18] Gyr, and age_ SF=0.018[0.009-3] Gyr.
Thus, we obtain robust measurements of low stellar mass and dust content, but
we cannot place meaningful constraints on the age or star formation history of
the LAEs. We also calculate the instantaneous SFR to be 35[0.003-170] M_sun/yr,
with its average over the last 100 Myr before observation giving
<SFR>_100=4[2-30] M_sun/yr. When we compare the results for the same star
formation history, LAEs at z~2.1 are dustier and show higher instantaneous SFRs
than z~3.1 LAEs, while the observed stellar masses of the two samples seem
consistent. LAEs appear to occupy the low-mass end of the distribution of star
forming galaxies at z~2. We perform SED fitting on several sub-samples selected
based on photometric properties and find that LAE sub-samples at z~2.1 exhibit
heterogeneous properties. The IRAC-bright, UV-bright and red LAEs have the
largest stellar mass and dust reddening. The UV-faint, IRAC-faint, and high
equivalent width LAE sub-samples appear less massive (<10^9 M_sun) and less
dusty, with E(B-V) consistent with zero.

significantly magnetized. A dynamically important magnetic field presents a
significant obstacle to the formation of protostellar disks. Recent studies
have shown that magnetic braking is strong enough to suppress the formation of
rotationally supported disks in the ideal MHD limit. Whether non-ideal MHD
effects can enable disk formation remains unsettled. We carry out a first study
on how disk formation in magnetic clouds is modified by the Hall effect, the
least explored of the three non-ideal MHD effects in star formation (the other
two being ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation). For illustrative
purposes, we consider a simplified problem of a non-self-gravitating,
magnetized envelope collapsing onto a central protostar of fixed mass. We find
that the Hall effect can spin up the inner part of the collapsing flow to
Keplerian speed, producing a rotationally supported disk. The disk is generated
through a Hall-induced magnetic torque. Disk formation occurs even when the
envelope is initially non-rotating, provided that the Hall coefficient is large
enough. When the magnetic field orientation is flipped, the direction of disk
rotation is reversed as well. The implication is that the Hall effect can in
principle produce both regularly rotating and counter-rotating disks around
protostars. We conclude that the Hall effect is an important factor to consider
in studying the angular momentum evolution of magnetized star formation in
general and disk formation in particular.

of nearly critical charge, and are precursors to the emission of a sustained

kinematically stable dynamos with a dominating axisymmetric, antisymmetric with
respect to the equator and non-periodic fundamental dynamo mode. The analysis
requires a number of steps: the computation of the so-called dynamo
coefficients, the derivation of the temporally and azimuthally averaged dynamo
eigenmodes and the decomposition of the magnetic field of the numerical
geodynamo model into the eigenmodes. For the determination of the theoretical
mode excitation levels the turbulent velocity field needs to be projected on
the dynamo eigenmodes. We compare the theoretically and numerically derived
mean mode coefficients and find reasonably good agreement for most of the
modes. Some deviation might be attributable to the approximation involved in
the theory. Since the dynamo eigenmodes are not self-adjoint a spectral

nonlinear optics, researchers have expended a great deal of effort to optimize
the second-order molecular nonlinear-optical response, called the
hyperpolarizability. The focus of our present studies is the {\em intrinsic}
hyperpolarizability, which is a scale-invariant quantity that removes the
effects of simple scaling, thus being the relevant quantity for comparing
molecules of varying sizes. Past theoretical studies have focused on structural
properties that optimize the intrinsic hyperpolarizability, which have
characterized the structure of the quantum system based on the potential energy
function, placement of nuclei, geometry, and the effects of external electric
and magnetic fields. Those previous studies focused on single-electron models
under the influence of an average potential. In the present studies, we
generalize our calculations to two-electron systems and include electron
interactions. As with the single-electron studies, universal properties are
found that are common to all systems -- be they molecules, nanoparticles, or
quantum gases -- when the hyperpolarizability is near the fundamental limit.

(\textbf{q}) positions are compared as a function of doping and for the
different dopants. The spectra in the energy range 1-6 eV can be described with
three broad peaks, which evolve systematically with increased doping. The most
systematic trend was observed for \textbf{q}=($\pi$, 0) corresponding to the
zone boundary. As hole doping increased, the spectral weight transfer from high
energies to low energies is nearly linear with \emph{x} at this \textbf{q}. We
interpret the peaks as interband transitions in the context of existing band
models for this system, assigning them to Zhang-Rice band$\rightarrow$upper
Hubbard band, lower-lying band$\rightarrow$upper Hubbard band, and lower-lying
band$\rightarrow$Zhang-Rice band transitions. The spectrum of stripe-ordered
LBCO was also measured, and found to be identical to the correspondingly doped
LSCO, except for a relative enhancement of the near-infrared peak intensity
around 1.5-1.7 eV. The temperature dependence of this near-infrared peak in
LBCO was more pronounced than for other parts of the spectrum, continuously
decreasing in intensity as the temperature was raised from 25 K to 300 K.
Finally, we find that 4\% Ni substitution in the Cu site has a similar effect
on the spectra as does Sr substitution in the La site.

(Ge-NCs TFs) were prepared using a low temperature in-situ growth method.
Unexpected high p-type conductivity was observed in the intrinsic Ge-NCs TFs.
Unintentional doping from shallow dopants was excluded as a candidate mechanism
of hole generation. Instead, the p-type characteristic was attributed to
surface state induced hole accumulation in NCs, and the hole conduction was
found to be a thermally activated process involving charge hopping from one NC
to its nearest neighbor. Theoretical analysis has shown that the density of
surface states in Ge-NCs is sufficient to induce adequate holes for measured
conductivity. The film conductivity can be improved significantly by
post-growth rapid thermal annealing and this effect is explained by a simple
thermodynamic model. The impact of impurities on the conduction properties was
also studied. Neither compensation nor enhancement in conduction was observed
in the Sb and Ga doped Ge-NCs TFs, respectively. This could be attributed to
the fact that these impurities are no longer shallow dopants in NCs and are
much less likely to be effectively activated. Finally, the photovoltaic effect
of heterojunction diodes employing such Ge-NCs TFs was characterized in order
to demonstrate its functionality in device implementation.

conductivity ($\sigma_1$) of resonant exciton scales linearly with number of
graphene layer (up to \emph{at least} 8 layers) implying quantum character of
electrons in graphene. Furthermore, a prominent excitation at 5.4eV, which is a
mixture of interband transitions from $\pi$ to $\pi^{*}$ at the M point and a
$\pi$ plasmonic excitation, is observed. In contrast, for graphite the resonant
exciton is not observable but strong interband transitions are seen instead.
Supported by theoretical calculations, for $N \leq$ 28 the $\sigma_1$ is
dominated by the resonant exciton, while for $N >$ 28 it is a mixture between
exitonic and interband transitions. The latter is characteristic for graphite,

phenotypes, including diverse degrees of virulence. The evolution of virulence
in viral populations is, however, poorly understood. Based on the experimental
observation of an RNA virus clone in cell culture diversifying into two
subpopulations of different virulence, we study the dynamics of heterogeneous
virus populations and the evolution of virulence. We introduce a
competition-colonization trade-off into standard mathematical models of
intra-host viral infection. Colonizers are fast spreading, virulent strains,
whereas competitors are less virulent variants that are more successful within
coinfected cells. We observe biphasic dynamics of the population: Early in the
infection the population is dominated by colonizers, which later will be
outcompeted by competitors. The simulations suggest the existence of a steady
state where few low-virulence variants coexist. This equilibrium implies
collective virulence attenuation in the population, in contrast to previous
models predicting development of the population towards increased virulence.
Nevertheless, the attenuation effect disappears if we include a highly
simplified immune response in our models. Thus, the competition-colonization
trade-off indicates a role for virulence in the modulation of the viral
population diversity. The evolution of virulence is a dynamic feature of the
population shaped by interactions between individuals and by the structure of
the patchy habitat.

(WSNs) in separate research communities is an ever-growing gap between theory
and practice. Even though there is a increasing number of algorithmic methods
for WSNs, the vast majority has never been tried in practice; conversely, many
practical challenges are still awaiting efficient algorithmic solutions. The
main cause for this discrepancy is the fact that programming sensor nodes still
happens at a very technical level. We remedy the situation by introducing
Wiselib, our algorithm library that allows for simple implementations of
algorithms onto a large variety of hardware and software. This is achieved by
employing advanced C++ techniques such as templates and inline functions,
allowing to write generic code that is resolved and bound at compile time,
resulting in virtually no memory or computation overhead at run time.
  The Wiselib runs on different host operating systems, such as Contiki, iSense
OS, and ScatterWeb. Furthermore, it runs on virtual nodes simulated by Shawn.
For any algorithm, the Wiselib provides data structures that suit the specific
properties of the target platform. Algorithm code does not contain any
platform-specific specializations, allowing a single implementation to run
natively on heterogeneous networks.
  In this paper, we describe the building blocks of the Wiselib, and analyze
the overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing how
routing algorithms can be implemented. We also report on results from
experiments with real sensor-node hardware.

generalizes the well-known $K$-user $M$-antenna interference channel, where
each message is requested by a unique receiver. For our setup, we derive the
degrees of freedom (DoF) region. The achievability scheme generalizes the
interference alignment schemes proposed by Cadambe and Jafar. In particular, we
achieve general points in the DoF region by using multiple base vectors and
aligning all interferers at a given receiver to the interferer with the largest
DoF. As a byproduct, we obtain the DoF region for the original interference
channel. We also discuss extensions of our approach where the same region can
be achieved by considering a reduced set of interference alignment constraints,
thus reducing the time-expansion duration needed. The DoF region for the
considered system depends only on a subset of receivers whose demands meet
certain characteristics. The geometric shape of the DoF region is also
discussed.

a quadratic dependence on the conformality measure, whereas in certain strongly

effective kinetic theory of quasiparticle excitations with medium-modified

gluon plasma. We show that in this approach, depending on the temperature, the
viscosity ratio exhibits either of these dependencies found by means of weak
coupling perturbative or strong coupling holographic techniques. The turning
point between the two different dependencies is located around the maximum in
the scaled interaction measure.

phase of rho = 1/2 for the extended Bose-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice
using first principles Monte Carlo calculations. The motivation of our study is
to quantitatively understand the impact of theoretical input, in particular the
dynamical critical exponent z, in calculating the critical exponent nu. Hence
we have carried out four sets of simulations with beta = 2N^{1/2}, beta =
8N^{1/2}, beta = N/2, and beta = N/4, respectively. Here beta is the inverse
temperature and N is the numbers of lattice sites used in the simulations. By
applying data collapse to the observable superfluid density rho_{s2} in the
second spatial direction, we confirm that the transition is indeed governed by
the superfluid-insulator universality class. However we find it is subtle to
determine the precise location of the critical point. For example, while the
critical chemical potential (mu/V)_c occurs at (mu/V)_c = 2.3239(3) for the
data obtained using beta = 2N^{1/2}, the (mu/V)_c determined from the data
simulated with beta = N/2 is found to be (mu/V)_c = 2.3186(2). Further, while a
good data collapse for rho_{s2}N can be obtained with the data determined using
beta = N/4 in the simulations, a reasonable quality of data collapse for the
same observable calculated from another set of simulations with beta = 8N^{1/2}
can hardly be reached. Surprisingly, assuming z for this phase transition is
determined to be 2 first in a Monte Carlo calculation, then a high quality data
collapse for rho_{s2}N can be achieved for (mu/V)_c ~ 2.3184 and nu ~ 0.7 using
the data obtained with beta = 8N^{1/2}. Our results imply that one might need
to reconsider the established phase diagrams of some models if the accurate
location of the critical point is crucial in obtaining a conclusion.

equation is presented here. We consider elegant presentation of the exact
solution in a spherical coordinate system, along with the assuming of
separation of the two angular co-ordinates from the radial and time variables.
The separation of variables follows from an assumed product form of the full
potential function, which should allow us to reduce the Schroedinger Eq. to
Riccati ODE in stationary case. If the angular dependence is constant, then the
azimuthal dependence is linear and the polar dependence is logarithmic. With
this reduction the remaining partial differential equation links the radial and
time dependence which is, in effect, the standard time-dependent spherical
radial Schroedinger equation. Besides, we obtain that the time-depended
2-angles solutions exist if the axis of preferential direction of wave
propagation is similar to the time arrow in mechanical processes. The other
possibility is the appropriate phase-shifting of the time-depended solutions. A
paraxial type approximation is obtained for the solution in the limit in which
the polar angle approaches zero.

access to the information of interest from data gathered by spatially
distributed sensors. Generally the users require only certain aggregate
functions of this distributed data. Computation of this aggregate data under
the end-to-end information flow paradigm by communicating all the relevant data
to a central collector node is a highly inefficient solution for this purpose.
An alternative proposition is to perform in-network computation. This, however,
raises questions such as: what is the optimal way to compute an aggregate
function from a set of statistically correlated values stored in different
nodes; what is the security of such aggregation as the results sent by a
compromised or faulty node in the network can adversely affect the accuracy of
the computed result. In this paper, we have presented an energy-efficient
aggregation algorithm for WSNs that is secure and robust against malicious
insider attack by any compromised or faulty node in the network. In contrast to
the traditional snapshot aggregation approach in WSNs, a node in the proposed
algorithm instead of unicasting its sensed information to its parent node,
broadcasts its estimate to all its neighbors. This makes the system more
fault-tolerant and increase the information availability in the network. The
simulations conducted on the proposed algorithm have produced results that
demonstrate its effectiveness.
