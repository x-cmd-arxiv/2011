raised claims that the scale-free (fractal) or multiscale (multifractal)
parameters inferred from the studied magnetograms may help assess the eruptive
potential of solar active regions, or may even help predict major flaring
activity stemming from these regions. We investigate these claims here, by
testing three widely used scale-free and multiscale parameters, namely, the
fractal dimension, the multifractal structure function and its inertial-range
exponent, and the turbulent power spectrum and its power-law index, on a
comprehensive data set of 370 timeseries of active-region magnetograms (17,733
magnetograms in total) observed by SOHO's Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) over
the entire Solar Cycle 23. We find that both flaring and non-flaring active
regions exhibit significant fractality, multifractality, and non-Kolmogorov
turbulence but none of the three tested parameters manages to distinguish
active regions with major flares from flare-quiet ones. We also find that the
multiscale parameters, but not the scale-free fractal dimension, depend
sensitively on the spatial resolution and perhaps the observational
characteristics of the studied magnetograms. Extending previous works, we
attribute the flare-forecasting inability of fractal and multifractal
parameters to i) a widespread multiscale complexity caused by a possible
underlying self-organization in turbulent solar magnetic structures, flaring
and non-flaring alike, and ii) a lack of correlation between the fractal
properties of the photosphere and overlying layers, where solar eruptions
occur. However useful for understanding solar magnetism, therefore, scale-free
and multiscale measures may not be optimal tools for active-region
characterization in terms of eruptive ability or, ultimately,for major
solar-flare prediction.

newly discovered low-mass detached eclipsing binaries found in the All-Sky
Automated Survey (ASAS) catalogue: ASAS J093814-0104.4 and ASAS J212954-5620.1.
Using the GIRAFFE instrument on the 1.9-m Radcliffe telescope at SAAO and the
UCLES spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, we obtained
high-resolution spectra of both objects and derived their radial velocities
(RVs) at various orbital phases. The RVs of both objects were measured with the
TODCOR technique using synthetic template spectra as references. We also
obtained V and I band photometry using the 1.0-m Elizabeth telescope at SAAO
and the 0.4-m PROMPT instruments located at the CTIO. The orbital and physical
parameters of the systems were derived with PHOEBE and JKTEBOP codes. We
compared our results with several sets of widely-used isochrones. Our
multi-epoch photometric observations demonstrate that both objects show
significant out-of-eclipse modulations, which vary in time. We believe that
this effect is caused by stellar spots, which evolve on time scales of tens of
days. For this reason, we constructed our models on the basis of photometric
observations spanning short time scales (less than a month). Our modeling
indicates that (1) ASAS-09 is a main sequence active system with nearly-twin
components with masses of M1 = 0.771(33) Msun, M2 = 0.768(21) Msun and radii of
R1 = 0.772(12) Rsun and R2 = 0.769(13) Rsun. (2) ASAS-21 is a main sequence
active binary with component masses of M1 = 0.833(17) Msun, M2 = 0.703(13) Msun
and radii of R1 = 0.845(12) Rsun and R2 = 0.718(17) Rsun. Both systems confirm
the characteristic of active low-mass stars, for which the observed radii are
larger and the temperatures lower than predicted by evolutionary models. Other
parameters agree within errors with the models of main sequence stars.

  This could change due to recently developed open-source equipment and
software that can capture and digitize signals from the GSM frequencies. This
might make practical attacks against GSM much simpler to perform.
  Indeed, several claims have recently appeared in the media on successfully
eavesdropping on GSM. When looking at these claims in depth the conclusion is
often that more is claimed than what they are actually capable of. However, it
is undeniable that these claims herald the possibilities to eavesdrop on GSM
using publicly available equipment.
  This paper evaluates the claims and practical possibilities when it comes to
eavesdropping on GSM, using relatively cheap hardware and open source

of the paper is extensive experiments with the USRP (Universal Software Radio

both to new nanotechnology devices and to dark energy in cosmology. The crucial
question is the dependence of the energy on the system geometry under study.
Despite much progress since the first prediction of the Casimir effect in 1948
and its subsequent experimental verification in simple geometries, even the
sign of the force in nontrivial situations is still a matter of controversy.
Mathematically, vacuum energy fits squarely into the spectral theory of
second-order self-adjoint elliptic linear differential operators. Specifically,
one promising approach is based on the small-t asymptotics of the cylinder
kernel e^(-t sqrt(H)), where H is the self-adjoint operator under study. In
contrast with the well-studied heat kernel e^(-tH), the cylinder kernel depends
in a non-local way on the geometry of the problem. We discuss some results by
the Louisiana-Oklahoma-Texas collaboration on vacuum energy in model systems,
including quantum graphs and two-dimensional cavities. The results may shed
light on general questions, including the relationship between vacuum energy
and periodic or closed classical orbits, and the contribution to vacuum energy

debris into the inter-universal medium (IUM) of the multiverse for
conservation. A prominent component of the debris and of the IUM is the
enormous number of old cold photons from decaying universes. When a small
central volume (apparently 6.4 percent of the total mass) of our proto-universe
reached proton density, the old photons and protons became fully re-energized.
Outside of that volume, the large numbers of remaining old photons continued

the tight correlations found between these quantities and velocity dispersion
within the clusters are weaker in their outskirts. All three stellar population
parameters of cluster galaxies are positively correlated with velocity
dispersion. Galaxies in clusters form a homogeneous class of objects that have
similar distributions of line-strengths and stellar population parameters, and
follow similar scaling relations regardless of cluster richness or morphology.
We estimate the intrinsic scatter of the Gaussian distribution of metallicities
to be 0.3 dex, while that of the alpha-element abundance ratio is 0.07 dex. The
e-folding time of the exponential distribution of galaxy ages is estimated to
be 900 Myr. The intrinsic scatters of the metallicity and alpha-element
abundance ratio distributions can almost entirely be accounted for by the
correlations with velocity dispersion and the intrinsic scatter about these
relations. This implies that a galaxies mass plays the major role in
determining its stellar population.

fluctuation conundrum"", a Gedankenexperiment which led Jordan to his
quantization of waves published as a separate section in the famous
Born-Heisenberg-Jordan 1926 ""Dreim\""annerarbeit"". The thermal nature of energy
fluctuations caused by the restriction of the QFT vacuum to a subvolume
remained unnoticed mainly because it is not present in QM. In order to
understand the analogy with Einstein's fluctuation calculation in a thermal
black body system, it is important to expose the mechanism which causes a
global vacuum state to become impure on a localized subalgebra of QFT. The
present work presents the fascinating history behind this problem which
culminated in the more recent perception that ""causal localization"" leads to
thermal manifestations. The most appropriate concept which places this property
of QFT into the forefront is ""modular localization"". These new developments in
QFT led to a new access to the existence problem for interacting quantum fields
whose solution has remained outside the range of renormalized perturbation
theory. It also clarifies open problems about the relation of particles and
fields in particular about the incompletely understood crossing property. Last
not least it leads to a constructive understanding of integrable versus
non-integrable QFTs..

A third major discovery, cosmic acceleration suggesting a relatively tiny

statistical counting and the local geography of our universe. The unavoidable

decomposing the effective neutrino mass matrix associated to it, we derive

We extend this phenomenological analysis to other mass-independent mixing

We classify models that produce tribimaximal leptonic mixing through the group
structure of their family symmetries in order to point out that there is often
a direct connection between the group structure and the phenomenological

role here, as it restricts the choices of family representations and affects
the viability of leptogenesis. We also present a recipe to generalize a given

illustrated by constructing toy models with the transpose tribimaximal,

observations trace the afterglow evolution when the blastwave has decelerated
to mildly- or non-relativistic velocities and has roughly isotropized. We infer
beaming-independent kinetic energies using the Sedov-Taylor self-similar
solution, and find a median value for the sample of detected bursts of about
7x10^51 erg, with a 90% confidence range of 1.1x10^50-3.3x10^53 erg. Both the
median and 90% confidence range are somewhat larger than the results of
multi-wavelength, multi-epoch afterglow modeling (including large beaming
corrections), and the distribution of beaming-corrected gamma-ray energies.
This is due to bursts in our sample with only a single-frequency observation
for which we can only determine an upper bound on the peak of the synchrotron
spectrum. This limitation leads to a wider range of allowed energies than for
bursts with a well-measured spectral peak. Our study indicates that
single-epoch centimeter-band observations covering the spectral peak on a
timescale of ~1 yr can provide a robust estimate of the total kinetic energy
distribution with a small investment of telescope time. The substantial
increase in bandwidth of the EVLA (up to 8 GHz simultaneously with full

these grids for the specific properties of each planet, including the
appropriate chemical abundances and incident fluxes as a function of solar
system age. Using these grids, we compute new models of the thermal evolution
of the major planets in an attempt to match their measured luminosities at
their known ages. Compared to previous work, we find longer cooling times,
predominantly due to higher atmospheric opacity at young ages. For all planets,
we employ simple ""standard"" cooling models that feature adiabatic temperature
gradients in the interior H/He and water layers, and an initially hot starting
point for the calculation of subsequent cooling. For Jupiter we find a model
cooling age 10% longer than previous work, a modest quantitative difference.
This may indicate that the hydrogen equation of state used here overestimates
the temperatures in the deep interior of the planet. For Saturn we find a model
cooling age 20% longer than previous work. However, an additional energy
source, such as that due to helium phase separation, is still clearly needed.
For Neptune, unlike in work from the 1980s and 1990s, we match the measured
Teff of the planet with a model that also matches the planet's current gravity
field. This is predominantly due to advances in the equation of state of water.
This may indicate that the planet possesses no barriers to efficient convection
in its deep interior. However, for Uranus, our models exacerbate the well-known
problem that Uranus is far cooler than calculations predict, which could imply
strong barriers to interior convective cooling.

Hugoniot to be virtually coincident in this pressure range. Above ~400 GPa
shock dissipation must go primarily into temperature, which is observed
experimentally as a rapid increase in shock pressure above ~400 GPa. The
metallization of glassy Al2O3, if verified, is expected to be general in strong
oxide insulators. Implications for Super Earths are discussed.

edge--states in a conventional two-dimensional electron system. In all cases,
the edge states closest to zero energy include a hole-like edge state of one

may not cross depending on the boundary condition. Edge states with the same
spin generically have anticrossings that complicate the spectra, but which may
be understood within degenerate perturbation theory. The results demonstrate
that the number of edge states crossing the Fermi level in clean, undoped

three different polarization switching events: (1) 71{\deg} switching from r1-

switching from r1- to r1+ (the superscript + and - stand for up and down

degradation of the ferroelectric properties of BiFeO3 will result in losing
controllability of magnetic order switching in magnetoelectric devices and
capacity for information storage in ferroelectric memory devices. Especially,
polarization fatigue will directly restrict the reliability of the actual

each polarization switching path in BiFeO3 thin films. In this communication,
we report polarization fatigue in BiFeO3 depending on switching path, and
propose a fatigue model which will broaden our understanding of the fatigue

both modifies the dynamics of, and is perturbed by, high-energy or heavy quarks

have weaker fine structure lines relative to their far-infrared continuum than

manifest is similar to the limit that separates between the two modes of star
formation recently found in galaxies on the basis of studies of their gas-star
formation relations. Our finding that the properties of the interstellar medium

worse, the dense nesting of mirror shells in an optical module results in a
mutual obstruction of their aperture when an astronomical source is off-axis,
with a further effective area reduction. [...] While the effective area of an
X-ray mirror is easy to predict on-axis, the same task becomes more difficult
for a source off-axis. It is therefore important to develop an appropriate
formalism to reliably compute the off-axis effective area of a Wolter-I mirror,
including the effect of obstructions. Most of collecting area simulation for
X-ray optical modules has been so far performed along with numerical codes,
involving ray-tracing routines, very effective but in general complex,
difficult to handle, time consuming and affected by statistical errors. In
contrast, in a previous paper we approached this problem from an analytical
viewpoint, to the end of simplifying and speeding up the prediction of the
off-axis effective area of unobstructed X-ray mirrors with any reflective
coating, including multilayers.In this work we extend the analytical results
obtained: we show that the analytical formula for the off-axis effective area
can be inverted, and we expose in detail a novel analytical treatment of mutual
shell obstruction in densely nested mirror assemblies, which reduces the
off-axis effective area computation to a simple integration. The results are in
excellent agreement with the findings of a detailed ray-tracing routine.

Project of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) collaboration. The survey is
sensitive to Jupiter-radius planets around all of the target stars, and has
sufficient precision to reach Neptunes and super-Earths for the best targets.
The Palomar Transient Factory is a fully-automated, wide-field survey aimed at
a systematic exploration of the optical transient sky. The survey is performed
using a new 7.26 square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin
telescope at Palomar Observatory. Each 92-megapixel R-band exposure contains
about 3,000 M-dwarfs usable for planet detection. In each PTF observational
season PTF/M-dwarfs searches for Jupiter-radius planets around almost 30,000
M-dwarfs, Neptune-radius planets around approximately 500 M-dwarfs, and
super-Earths around 100 targets. The full survey is expected to cover more than
100,000 targets over the next several years. Photometric and spectroscopic
followup operations are performed on the Palomar 60-inch, LCOGT, Palomar
200-inch, MDM and Keck telescopes. The survey has been running since mid-2009.
We detail the survey design, the survey's data analysis pipeline and the
performance of the first year of operations.

predictors that either individually or in combination with others affect a
response variable. The method is designed for regression problems involving
binary or tertiary predictors and allows the number of predictors to exceed the
size of the sample, two properties which make it well suited for association
studies. Sparse Partitioning differs from other regression methods by placing
no restrictions on how the predictors may influence the response. To compensate
for this generality, Sparse Partitioning implements a novel way of exploring
the model space. It searches for high posterior probability partitions of the
predictor set, where each partition defines groups of predictors that jointly
influence the response. The result is a robust method that requires no prior
knowledge of the true predictor--response relationship. Testing on simulated
data suggests Sparse Partitioning will typically match the performance of an
existing method on a data set which obeys the existing method's model
assumptions. When these assumptions are violated, Sparse Partitioning will
generally offer superior performance.

Collider, how one could determine whether the supersymmetric model pointed out
is 4-dimensional or higher-dimensional ? We propose and develop a series of
tests for discriminating between a pure supersymmetry (SUSY) and a SUSY
realized within the well-motivated warped geometry a la Randall-Sundrum (RS).
Two of these tests make use of some different patterns arising in the
squark/slepton mass spectrum. The other distinctive RS SUSY feature is the
possibly larger (even dominant) Higgs boson decay branching ratios into
sleptons, compared to pure SUSY. Techniques for pinning up the presence of soft
SUSY breaking terms on the TeV-brane are also suggested, based on the analysis
of stop pair production at the International Linear Collider. For all these
phenomenological studies, we had first to derive the 4-dimensional (4D)
effective couplings and mass matrices of the sfermions and Higgs bosons in RS
SUSY. The localization of Higgs bosons, characteristic of RS, leads to
singularities in their couplings which are regularized by the exchange
contribution of infinite towers of Kaluza-Klein (KK) scalar modes with
Dirichlet-Dirichlet boundary conditions. A general method is provided for this
regularization, based on the completeness relation. The sfermion masses are
obtained either from integrating out those specific KK towers or by treating
their mixing effects. Finally, we show at the one-loop level how all quadratic
divergences in the Higgs mass cancel out for any cut-off, due to 5D SUSY and to
5D anomaly cancellation; the analytical way followed here also allows a
justification of the infinite KK summation required for the so-called KK
regularization in 5D SUSY, which has motivated a rich literature.

\beta_0 c$ through a constant magnetic field $B_0$ in vacuum induces a
component of the electric field along the magnetic field, generating a non-zero
second Poincare electromagnetic invariant $ ^* F \cdot F \neq 0$. This will
produce (e.g., via radiative effects and vacuum breakdown) an electric charge
density of the order of $\rho_{\rm ind}= B_0 \beta_0 /(2 \pi e R_G)$, where
$R_G = 2 G M/c^2$ is the Schwarzschild radius and $M$ is the mass of the black
hole; the charge density $\rho_{\rm ind}$ is similar to the Goldreich-Julian
density. The magnetospheres of moving black holes resemble in many respects the
magnetospheres of rotationally-powered pulsars, with pair formation fronts and
outer gaps, where the sign of the induced charge changes. As a result, the
black hole will generate bipolar electromagnetic jets each consisting of two
counter-aligned current flows (four current flows total), each carrying an
electric current of the order $I \approx e B_0 R_G \beta_0$. The
electromagnetic power of the jets is $L \approx (G M)^2 B_0^2 \beta_0^2/c^3$;
for a particular case of merging black holes the resulting Poynting power is $
L \approx {(G M)^3 B_0^2 /(c^5 R)}$, where $R$ is the radius of the orbit. In
addition, in limited regions near the horizon the first electromagnetic
invariant changes sign, so that the induced electric field becomes larger than
the magnetic field, $E>B$. The total energy loss from a system of merging BHs
is a sum of two components with similar powers, one due to the rotation of
space-time within the orbit, driven by the non-zero angular momentum in the
system, and the other due to the linear motion of the BHs through the magnetic
field.

parameters. By manually checking LASCO and EIT movies of these CMEs, we find

234 CMEs appearing above solar limb, and 325 CMEs without evident eruptive
signatures in the field of view of EIT. Based on the statistical results of
CMEs' source locations, four physical issues, including (1) the missing rate of
CMEs by SOHO LASCO and EIT, (2) the mass of CMEs, (3) the causes of halo CMEs
and (4) the deflections of CMEs in the corona, are exhaustively analyzed. It is
found that (1) about 32% of front-side CMEs can not be recognized by SOHO, (2)
the brightness of a CME at any heliocentric distance is roughly positively
correlated with its speed, and the CME mass derived from the brightness is
probably overestimated, (3) both projection effect and violent eruption are the
major causes of halo CMEs, and especially for limb halo CMEs, the latter is the
primary one, (4) most CMEs deflected towards equator near the solar minimum,

expansion, non-radial ejection, and the deflected propagation.

on soft X-ray flares from May 1976 to May 2008. It is found that the smoothed
monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very
noticeable time lag of 13, 8, and 8 months in cycle 21 respectively with
respect to the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers. There is no time lag between
the sunspot numbers and M-class flares in cycle 22. However, there is a
one-month time lag for C-class flares and a one-month time lead for X-class
flares with regard to sunspot numbers in cycle 22. For cycle 23, the smoothed
monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very
noticeable time lag of one month, 5 months, and 21 months respectively with
respect to sunspot numbers. If we take the three types of flares together, the
smoothed monthly peak fluxes of soft X-ray flares have a time lag of 9 months
in cycle 21, no time lag in cycle 22 and a characteristic time lag of 5 months
in cycle 23 with respect to the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers. Furthermore,
the correlation coefficients of the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of M-class and
X-class flares and the smoothed monthly sunspot numbers are higher in cycle 22
than those in cycles 21 and 23. The correlation coefficients between the three
kinds of soft X-ray flares in cycle 22 are higher than those in cycles 21 and
23. These findings may be instructive in predicting C-class, M-class, and
X-class flares regarding sunspot numbers in the next cycle and the physical
processes of energy storage and dissipation in the corona.

relevant for the LHC in various six-dimensional Universal Extra Dimension

Higgs decay into two photons induced by loop diagrams. They are one-loop
leading processes and the contribution of Kaluza-Klein particles is considered
to be significant. These processes are divergent in six dimensions. Therefore,
we employ a momentum cutoff, whose size is fixed from the validity of
perturbative calculation through naive dimensional analysis. In these
six-dimensional Universal Extra Dimension models, the Higgs production cross
section through gluon fusion strongly increases considerably and the Higgs
decay width into two photons decrease somehow. In particular in the case of the
compactification on Projective Sphere, these effects are remarkable. The
deviation of the $h^{(0)} \rightarrow 2 \gamma$ signal from the prediction of
the Standard model is much larger than that in the case of the five-dimensional
minimal UED model. We also consider threshold corrections in the two processes
and these effect are noteworthy when we choose low cutoff scale in 6D UED.

dark haloes, with our simple analytic model predictions. Our analytic models
consist of a main halo, which is modelled by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
density profile with three different forms of the truncation, plus the
correlated matter (2-halo term) around the main halo. We find that the smoothly

more than 10 times the virial radius. We then use this analytic model to
investigate potential biases in cluster weak lensing studies in which a single,
untruncated NFW component is usually assumed in interpreting observed signals.
We find that cluster masses, inferred by fitting reduced tangential shear
profiles with the NFW profile, tend to be underestimated by ~5-10% if fitting
is performed out to ~10'-30'. In contrast, the concentration parameter is
overestimated typically by ~20% for the same fitting range. We also investigate
biases in computing the signal-to-noise ratio of weak lensing mass peaks,

two techniques are proposed. First, filtering signals according to the user's

ratios are very suppressed in the standard model (SM), as the new decay

KK-number-conserving decays into the first KK modes of the $W$, $Z$ and top

multivariate stochastic processes: given a multivariate time series x, we
consider the likelihood function p_{\theta}(x) of different parameters \theta
in the VAR model as features to describe x. To compare two time series x and
x', we form the product of their features p_{\theta}(x) p_{\theta}(x') which is
integrated out w.r.t \theta using a matrix normal-inverse Wishart prior. Among
other properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of
the time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x
and x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary
state spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel
\kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram
matrices produced by \kappa on observations and subsequences of observations
enumerated in x and x'. We describe a computationally efficient implementation
of this generalization that uses low-rank matrix factorization techniques.

find large H3O+ abundances (N(H3O+)/N(H2)>10^{-8}) in all detected galaxies
apart from in IC342 where it is about one order of magnitude lower. We note,
however, that uncertainties in N(H3O+) may be significant due to lack of
definite information on source size and excitation. We furthermore compare the
derived N(H3O+) with N(HCO+) and find that the H3O+ to HCO+ column density
ratio is large in NGC1068 (24), moderate in NGC4418 and NGC253 (4-5), slightly
less than unity in NGC6240 (0.7) and lowest in IC342 (0.2-0.6). We compare our
results with models of X-ray and photon dominated regions (XDRs and PDRs). For
IC342 we find that a starburst PDR chemistry can explain the observed H3O+
abundance. For the other galaxies, the large H3O+ columns are generally
consistent with XDR models. In particular for NGC1068 the elevated
N(H3O+)/N(HCO+) ratio suggests a low column density XDR. For NGC4418 however,
large HC3N abundances are inconsistent with the XDR interpretation. An
alternative possibility is that H3O+ forms through H2O evaporating off dust
grains and reacting with HCO+ in warm, dense gas. This scenario could also
potentially fit the results for NGC253. Further studies of the excitation and
distribution of H3O+ - as well as Herschel observations of water abundances -
will help to further constrain the models.

analyze data from several individuals. In this study a compartmental model of

equation to model non-steady state concentrations of free leucine in the
plasma. Data obtained from tracer/tracee experiments for a group of healthy
control individuals and a group of individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus
type 2 are analyzed. We find that the interindividual variation of the model
parameters is much smaller for the nonlinear mixed effects models, compared to
traditional estimates obtained from each individual separately. Using the mixed
effects approach, the population parameters are estimated well also when only
half of the data are used for each individual. For a typical individual the
amount of free leucine is predicted to vary with a standard deviation of 8.9%
around a mean value during the experiment. Moreover, leucine degradation and
protein uptake of leucine is smaller, proteolysis larger, and the amount of
free leucine in the body is much larger for the diabetic individuals than the
control individuals. In conclusion nonlinear mixed effects models offers
improved estimates for model parameters in complex models based on
tracer/tracee data and may be a suitable tool to reduce data sampling in
clinical studies.

ideas with regard to a possible non-perturbative formulation). And, due to its
quantum field theoretical heritage, it is conceptually incompatible with
central implications of General Relativity, especially those resulting from the
general relativistic relation between gravity and spacetime. All known
formulations of String Theory are background-dependent. On the other hand, it
was not even possible to reproduce the Standard Model. Instead, String Theory
led to a multitude of internal problems - and to the plethora of low-energy
scenarios with different nomologies and symmetries, known as the String
Landscape. All attempts to find a dynamically motivated selection principle
remained without success, leaving String Theory without any predictive power.
The nomological unification of the fundamental forces is only achieved in a
purely formal way within the model-theoretical paradigm of Quantum Field Theory
- by means of physically unmotivated epicycles like higher dimensionality,
Calabi-Yau spaces, branes, etc.

and have a role in the determination of the required conditions for the
emergence and evolution of life (planetary habitability). We study here the
role of rotation in the evolution of dynamo-generated magnetic fields in
massive earth-like planets, Super Earths (1-10 $M_\oplus$). Using the most
recent thermal evolution models of Super Earths (Gaidos et al. 2010; Tachinami
et al. 2011) and updated scaling laws for convection-driven dynamos, we predict
the evolution of the local Rossby number. This quantity is one of the proxies
for core magnetic field regime, i.e. non-reversing dipolar, reversing dipolar
and multipolar. We study the dependence of the local Rossby number and hence
the core magnetic field regime on planetary mass and rotation rate. Previous
works have focused only on the evolution of core magnetic fields assuming
rapidly rotating planets i.e. planets in the dipolar regime. In this work we go
further, including the effects of rotation in the evolution of planetary
magnetic field regime and obtaining global constraints to the existence of
intense protective magnetic fields in rapidly and slowly rotating Super Earths.
We find that the emergence and continued existence of a protective planetary
magnetic field is not only a function of planetary mass but also depend on
rotation rate. Low-mass Super Earths ($M\lesssim 2 M_\oplus$) develop intense
surface magnetic fields but their lifetimes will be limited to 2-4 Gyrs for
rotational periods larger than 1-4 days. On the other hand and also in the case
of slowly rotating planets, more massive Super Earths ($M\gtrsim 2 M_\oplus$)
have weak magnetic fields but their dipoles will last longer. Finally we
analyze tidally locked Super Earths inside and outside the habitable zone of
GKM stars.

energies where the S-matrix becomes singular. Knowledge of such resonances is
important in the study of the underlying physical system. Often the
Schr\""odinger equation is dependent on some parameter and one is interested in
following the path of the resonances in the complex energy plane as the
parameter changes. This is particularly true in coupled channel systems where
the resonant behavior is highly dependent on the strength of the channel
coupling, the energy separation of the channels and other factors. In previous
work it was shown that numerical continuation, a technique familiar in the
study of dynamical systems, can be brought to bear on the problem of following
the resonance path in one dimensional problems and multi-channel problems
without energy separation between the channels. A regularization can be defined
that eliminates coalescing poles and zeros that appear in the S-matrix at the
origin due to symmetries. Following the zeros of this regularized function then
traces the resonance path. In this work we show that this approach can be
extended to channels with energy separation, albeit limited to two channels.
The issue here is that the energy separation introduces branch cuts in the
complex energy domain that need to be eliminated with a so-called
uniformization. We demonstrate that the resulting approach is suitable for
investigating resonances in two-channel systems and provide an extensive
example.

preparing small sections of natural minerals and synthesizing melt droplets

that k values below 10^(-5) are very rare in natural minerals including
stardust grains, if they occur at all. Data for k and the absorption cross
section are important for various physical properties of stardust grains such
as temperature and radiation pressure. With increasing absorption cross section

known in primitive meteorites (chondrites). They predate the other components
by 1-2 Myr, and likely condensed within a short time interval, close to the Sun
in the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Their preservation must counterbalance both
the sunward drift caused by gas drag and the general inward motion of the
entraining gas. We propose that an efficient outward transport of CAIs can be
achieved by advection as a result of the viscous expansion of the disk,
provided it is initially less than 10 AU in size, which we argue is plausible
from both observational and theoretical points of view. Gas drag would stop
this outward motion within $10^5$ yr. However, by that time, a magnetically
dead zone would have developed as gravitational instabilities fade away, which
would trap CAIs for a significant fraction of the disk lifetime because of the
reduced advection velocities. The dead zone would also prevent outward
diffusion of subsequently condensed CAIs, contributing to their observed narrow
age range. This preservation mechanism is independent of the outward transport
scenario (before the dead zone formation) and a natural consequence of
considering the source of turbulence in accretion disks.

to test these filters considering polarized compact sources immersed in
stationary noise. The FF performs better than the ModF in terms of errors in

with previous works by Seoud & Vassilicos (2007) and Mazellier & Vassilicos
(2010) but also extend the length of the assessed decay region and consolidate
the results by repeating the experiments with different probes of increased
spatial resolution. It is confirmed that this moderately high Reynolds number
Re{\lambda} turbulence (up to Re{\lambda} {\simeq}350 here) does not follow the
classical high Reynolds number scaling of the dissipation rate {\epsilon} ~
u'^3/L and does not obey the equivalent proportionality between the
Taylor-based Reynolds number Re{\lambda} and the ratio of integral scale L to
Taylor micro-scale {\lambda}. Instead we observe an approximate proportionality
between L and {\lambda} during decay. This non-classical behaviour is
investigated by studying how the energy spectra evolve during decay and
examining how well they can be described by self-preserving single-length scale
forms. A detailed study of homogeneity and isotropy is also presented which
reveals the presence of transverse energy transport and pressure transport in
the part of the turbulence decay region where we take data (even though
previous studies found mean flow and turbulence intensity profiles to be
approximately homogeneous in much of the decay region). The exceptionally fast
turbulence decay observed in the part of the decay region where we take data is
consistent with the non-classical behaviour of the dissipation rate.
Measurements with a regular square mesh grid as well as comparisons with active
grid experiments by Mydlarski & Warhaft (1996) and Kang, Chester & Meveneau

a sample of ten bright low energy peaked blazars (LBLs). Forty photometric
observations, of an average of ~ 4 hours each, were made between 2008 September
and 2009 June using two telescopes in India. Measurements with good signal to
noise ratios were typically obtained within 1-3 minutes, allowing the detection
of weak, fast variations using N-star differential photometry. We employed both
structure function and discrete correlation function analysis methods to
estimate any dominant timescales of variability and found that in most of the
cases any such timescales were longer than the duration of the observation. The
calculated duty cycle of IDV in LBLs during our observing run is ~ 52%, which
is low compared to many earlier studies; however, the relatively short periods
for which each source was observed can probably explain this difference. We
briefly discuss possible emission mechanisms for the observed variability.

light, induced in a gas by electric and magnetic fields. This bilinear
magneto-electro-optical phenomenon appears in the presence of crossed electric
and magnetic fields perpendicular to the light wavevector, as a refractive
index difference between two counterpropagating directions. Using a high
finesse ring cavity, we have measured this magneto-electric non-reciprocity in
molecular Nitrogen at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure; for light
polarized parallel to the magnetic field it is $2\eta_{\parallel

expected order of magnitude. Our measurement opens the way to a deeper insight
into light-matter interaction, since bilinear magneto-electric effects
correspond to a coupling beyond the electric dipole approximation. We were able
to measure a magneto-electric non-reciprocity as small as $\Delta n = (5\pm 2)

Chamaeleon molecular cloud complex. Its population of prestellar and

of star formation. Our goal is to characterize the earliest stages of star
formation in this cloud. We used the bolometer array LABOCA at APEX to map the
cloud in dust continuum emission at 870 micron. The detected sources are
analysed by carefully taking into account the spatial filtering inherent in the
data reduction process. A search for associations with YSOs is performed using
Spitzer data and the SIMBAD database. Most of the detected 870 micron emission
is distributed in 5 filaments. We identify 59 starless cores, one candidate
first hydrostatic core, and 21 sources associated with more evolved YSOs. The
starless cores are only found above a visual extinction threshold of 5 mag.
They are less dense than those detected in other nearby molecular clouds by a
factor of a few on average. The core mass distribution is consistent with the
IMF at the high-mass end but is overpopulated at the low-mass end. In addition,
at most 17% of the cores have a mass larger than the critical Bonnor-Ebert
mass. Both results suggest that a large fraction of the starless cores may not
be prestellar. Based on the census of prestellar cores, Class 0 protostars, and
more evolved YSOs, we conclude that the star formation rate has decreased with
time in this cloud. The low fraction of candidate prestellar cores among the
population of starless cores, the small number of Class 0 protostars, the high
global star formation efficiency, the decrease of the star formation rate with
time, and the low mass per unit length of the detected filaments all suggest
that we may be witnessing the end of the star formation process in Cha I

Model (SM) Higgs boson plays a role of the inflation field, an effective field
theory (EFT) approach is the most convenient for working out the consequences
of breaking of perturbative unitarity, caused by the strong coupling of the
Higgs field to the Ricci scalar. The domain of validity of the EFT approach is
given by the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff, which, roughly speaking, should always
exceed the Hubble parameter in the course of inflation. On the other hand,
applying the trusted principles of quantum gravity to a local EFT demands that
it should only be used to describe states in a region larger than their
corresponding Schwarschild radius, manifesting thus a sort of UV/IR
correspondence. We consider both constraints on EFT, to ascertain which models
of the SM Higgs inflation are able to simultaneously comply with them. We also
show that if the gravitational coupling evolves with the scale factor, the
holographic constraint can be alleviated significantly with minimal set of
canonical assumptions, by forcing the said coupling to be asymptotically free.

many researchers and possesses many important applications, the basic design
idea is very simple: composing effective media from many small structured
elements and controlling its artificial EM properties. According to the
effective-media model, the coupling interactions between the elements in
metamaterials are somewhat ignored; therefore, the effective properties of
metamaterials can be viewed as the ""averaged effect"" of the resonance property
of the individual elements. However, the coupling interaction between elements
should always exist when they are arranged into metamaterials. Sometimes,
especially when the elements are very close, this coupling effect is not
negligible and will have a substantial effect on the metamaterials' properties.
In recent years, it has been shown that the interaction between resonance
elements in metamaterials could lead to some novel phenomena and interesting
applications that do not exist in conventional uncoupled metamaterials. In this
paper, we will give a review of these recent developments in coupled
metamaterials. For the ""meta-molecule"" composed of several identical
resonators, the coupling between these units produces multiple discrete
resonance modes due to hybridization. In the case of a ""meta-crystal""
comprising an infinite number of resonators, these multiple discrete resonances
can be extended to form a continuous frequency band by strong coupling. This
kind of broadband and tunable coupled metamaterial may have interesting
applications. Many novel metamaterials and nanophotonic devices could be
developed from coupled resonator systems in the future.

According to the equivalent circuit model, one magnetic plasmon mode was
induced in the DRS. Due to the hybridization effect, two magnetic plasmon modes
were obtained in the TRS. Compared with the electric plasmon resonance in a
single-rod structure (SRS), the electromagnetic fields near the DRS and TRS
were much more localized in the dielectric surrounding the structures at the
resonance wavelengths. This caused the magnetic plasmon resonance wavelengths
to become very sensitive to refractive index changes in the environment medium.
As a result, a large figure of merit that is much larger than the electric
plasmon modes of SRS could be obtained in the magnetic plasmon modes of DRS and
TRS. These magnetic plasmon mode properties enable the use of DRSs and TRSs as
sensing elements with remarkable performance.

peak broadens into a far-infrared (FIR) band whose low-energy edge sets the
insulating gap. The insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) occurs when the
softening of the FIR band closes the gap thus evolving into a Drude term. In
the metallic phase, a multi-band analysis identifies a mid-infrared band which
weakly depends on temperature and softens for increasing p, while the
extended-Drude analysis leads to an optical scattering rate larger than the
frequency, as found in other cuprates. The infrared spectral weight W(T) is
consistent with a Fermi liquid renormalized by strong correlations, provided

In Paper I the
coupling between these motions was modelled by determining the horizontal
motion without reference to the vertical motion, and recovering the coupling by
assuming that the vertical action is adiabatically conserved as the star
oscillates horizontally. Here we show that, although the assumption of
adiabatic invariance works well, more accurate results can be obtained by
taking the vertical action into account when calculating the horizontal motion.
We use orbital tori to present a simple but fairly realistic model of the
Galaxy's discs in which the motion of stars is handled rigorously, without
decomposing it into horizontal and vertical components. We examine the ability
of the adiabatic approximation to calculate the model's observables, and find
that it performs perfectly in the plane, but errs slightly away from the plane.
When the new correction to the adiabatic approximation is used, the density,
streaming velocity and velocity dispersions are in error by less than 10 per
cent for distances up to $2.5\kpc$ from the Sun. The torus-based model reveals
that at locations above the plane the long axis of the velocity ellipsoid
points almost to the Galactic centre, even though the model potential is
significantly flattened. This result contradicts the widespread belief that the
shape of the Galaxy's potential can be strongly constrained by the orientation
of velocity ellipsoid near the Sun. An analysis of orbits reveals that in a
general potential the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid depends on the
structure of the model's distribution function as much as on its gravitational
potential, contrary to what is the case for Staeckel potentials. We argue that
the adiabatic approximation will provide a valuable complement to torus-based
models in the interpretation of current surveys of the Galaxy.
