electric field $E =E_0 + E_1 cos(\omega t)$ has been investigated theoretically
and numerically by computational methods. The calculation is done in the
hypersound regime $(ql\gg 1)$ where the attenuation coefficient depends on the
phonon wave vector $ q =[-\frac{\pi}{q} \quad \frac{2pi}{q}]$ and the frequency
$\omega_q = 10^{12} s^{-1}$ . An inversion is attained where amplification far
exceeds absorption and the ratio $
frac\mid\frac{\Gamma/\Gamma_0\mid_{min}}{\mid\Gamma/\Gamma_0\mid_{max}}\approx
3$ . A high frequency build up of acoustic energy from noise (phonon spectrum)
is obtained by using specialized spectral techniques. This indicates an
amplification of the phonons generated in the terahertz range leading to the
possibility of obtaining a hypersound MASER.

correlation function of galaxies detected through the sub-millimetre emission

represents the angular correlations as arising from one-halo and two-halo
contributions, is flexible but complex and rather unwieldy. The second model is
based on a much simpler approach: we incorporate a fitting function method to
estimate the matter correlation function with approximate model of the bias
inferred from the estimated redshift distribution to find the galaxy angular
correlation function. We find that both models give a good account of the shape
of the correlation functions obtained from published preliminary studies of the
HerMES and H-ATLAS surveys performed using Herschel, and yield consistent
estimates of the minimum halo mass within which the sub-millimetre galaxies
must reside. We note also that both models predict an inflection in the
correlation function at intermediate angular scales, so the presence of the
feature in the measured correlation function does not unambiguously indicate
the presence of intra-halo correlations. The primary barrier to more detailed
interpretation of these clustering measurements lies in the substantial
uncertainty surrounding the redshift distribution of the sources.

extend these notions in a natural way to a different class of perturbations,

out to be of particular interest. We show that for this class of functions,
ordinary noise sensitivity and noise sensitivity with respect to the complete
graph exclusion process are equivalent. We also show this equivalence with
respect to stability.
  After obtaining these fairly general results, we study ""exclusion
sensitivity"" of critical percolation in more detail with respect to
medium-range dynamics. The exclusion dynamics, due to its conservative nature,
is in some sense more physical than the classical i.i.d dynamics.
Interestingly, we will see that in order to obtain a precise understanding of
the exclusion sensitivity of percolation, we will need to describe how typical
spectral sets of percolation diffuse under the underlying exclusion process.

rest-frame mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum of the WLRG PKS 0043-42 (z=0.116) shows
a clear spectral turnover at wavelengths longer than ~20 micron suggestive of
warm dust, as well as a 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature. In addition,
the hard X-ray results, based on Chandra data, strongly support a picture in
which PKS 0043-42 has a torus and accretion disc more typical of Strong-Line
Radio Galaxies (SLRGs). The MIR and X-ray spectra are markedly different from
those of other WLRGs at similar redshifts, and here we show that the former can
be successfully fitted with clumpy torus models with parameters characteristic
of Type-2 AGN tori: close to edge-on (i=74 deg) and relatively broad (torus
angular width=60 deg), with an outer radius of 2 pc, hydrogen column density
~1.6x10^(23) cm^(-2), and AGN bolometric luminosity ~1.6x10^(44) erg s^(-1).
The presence of a compact torus in PKS 0043-42 provides evidence that this WLRG
is fuelled by cold, rather than hot, gas accretion. We suggest that WLRGs are a
diverse population, and PKS 0043-42 may represent a type of radio galaxy in
which the AGN activity has been recently re-triggered as a consequence of
intermittent gas supply, or in which the covering factor of the Narrow-Line

genealogies of continuous-state branching processes. This connection is based
on the construction of an explicit coupling using a particle representation
inspired by the lookdown process of Donnelly and Kurtz. This coupling has the
property that the coalescent comes down from infinity if and only if the
branching process becomes extinct, thereby answering a question of Bertoin and
Le Gall. The coupling also offers new perspective on the speed of coming down
from infinity and allows us to relate power-law behavior for $N^{\Lambda}(t)$
to the classical upper and lower indices arising in the study of pathwise
properties of L\'{e}vy processes.

crystal lattice have been identified experimentally. One is direct, for
infrared (IR)-active vibrations that carry an electric dipole. The second is
indirect, it occurs through intermediate excitation of the electronic system
via electron-phonon coupling, as in stimulated Raman scattering. Nearly 40
years ago, proposals were made of a third path, referred to as ionic Raman
scattering (IRS). It was posited that excitation of an IR-active phonon could
serve as the intermediate state for a Raman scattering process relying on
lattice anharmonicity as opposed to electron phonon interaction. In this paper,
we report an experimental demonstration of ionic Raman scattering and show that
this mechanism is relevant to optical control in solids. The key insight is
that a rectified phonon field can exert a directional force onto the crystal,
inducing an abrupt displacement of the atoms from the equilibrium positions
that could not be achieved through excitation of an IR-active vibration alone,
for which the force is oscillatory. IRS opens up a new direction for the
coherent control of solids in their electronic ground state, different from
approaches that rely on electronic excitations.

main sequence turn-offs (MMSTO), which challenge the classical idea that star
formation in such objects took place over short timescales. It has been
recently suggested that the presence of fast rotators among main sequence stars
could be the cause of such features (Bastian & de Mink 2009), hence relaxing
the need for extended periods of star formation. In this letter, we compute
evolutionary tracks and isochrones of models with and without rotation. We find
that, for the same age and input physics, both kinds of models present
turn-offs with an almost identical position in the colour-magnitude diagrams.
As a consequence, a dispersion of rotational velocities in coeval ensembles of
stars could not explain the presence of MMSTOs. We construct several synthetic
colour-magnitude diagrams for the different kinds of tracks and combinations of
them. The models that best reproduce the morphology of observed MMSTOs are
clearly those assuming a significant spread in the stellar ages - as long as
~400 Myr - added to a moderate amount of convective core overshooting. Only
these models produce the detailed ""golf club"" shape of observed MMSTOs. A
spread in rotational velocities alone cannot do anything similar. We also
discuss models involving a mixture of stars with and without overshooting, as
an additional scenario to producing MMSTOs with coeval populations. We find
that they produce turn-offs with a varying extension in the CMD direction
perpendicular to the lower main sequence, which are clearly not present in
observed MMSTOs.

local spectral function and we propose that this can be used to detect
edge-state magnetism by scanning tunneling microscopy. The dynamic spin
structure factor at the edge of a ribbon exhibits an approximately linearly
dispersing collective magnonlike mode at low energies that decays into Stoner

Mixing between photons and ALPs in the strong magnetic field of a Gamma-Ray

on the gamma-ray polarization and spectrum. Mixing in the intergalactic medium
is not expected to modify these signatures for ALP mass > 10^(-14) eV and/or

(EOS) of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter have been calculated using a
ring-diagarm formalism where the particle-particle-hole-hole ring diagrams are

obtained with linear BR scaling are both overly stiff compared with the

satisfactory results are obtained by either using the nonlinear Ericson scaling

power spectra of the galaxy distribution. In this work, we present a new method
for the detection of the real-space structures associated with this feature.
These baryon acoustic structures are spherical shells with a relatively small
density contrast, surrounding high density central regions. We design a
specific wavelet adapted to the search for shells, and exploit the physics of
the process by making use of two different mass tracers, introducing a specific
statistic to detect the BAO features. We show the effect of the BAO signal in
this new statistic when applied to the Lambda - Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model,
using an analytical approximation to the transfer function. We confirm the
reliability and stability of our method by using cosmological N-body
simulations from the MareNostrum Institut de Ci\`encies de l'Espai (MICE). We
apply our method to the detection of BAO in a galaxy sample drawn from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use the `Main' catalogue to trace the
shells, and the Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) as tracers of the high density
central regions. Using this new method, we detect, with a high significance,
that the LRGs in our sample are preferentially located close to the centres of
shell-like structures in the density field, with characteristics similar to
those expected from BAOs. We show that stacking selected shells, we can find
their characteristic density profile. We have delineated a new feature of the
cosmic web, the BAO shells. As these are real spatial structures, the BAO
phenomenon can be studied in detail by examining those shells.

us to report a strong similarity between some properties observed in power line
channels and the ones observed in other wireline channels, e.g. coaxial cables
and phone lines. For example, it is here reported that channel power gain and
logarithm of the RMS-DS in DSL links are \textit{linearly} correlated random
variables. Exploiting these results, we here propose a statistical wireline
channel model where tap amplitudes and delays are generated in order to reflect
these physical properties. Although wireline channels are considered
deterministic as their impulse response can be readily calculated once the link
topology is known, a statistical wireline channel model is useful because the
variability of link topologies and wiring practices give rise to a stochastic
aspect of wireline communications that has not been well characterized in the
literature. Finally, we also point out that alternative channel models that
normalize impulse responses to a common (often unitary) power gain may be
misleading when assessing the performance of equalization schemes since this
normalization artificially removes the correlation between channel power gain
and RMS-DS and, thus, Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).

be useful for studying small-structure in the lens galaxies. Four of the six
lenses show differences between K and L' flux ratios. In HE 0435$-1223, SDSS
0246-0825, and HE 2149-2745 the differences may be attributable to known
microlensing and/or intrinsic variability. In SDSS 0806+2006 the wavelength
dependence is not easily attributed to known variations, and may indicate the
presence of substructure. By contrast, in Q0142-100 and SBS 0909+523 the K and
L' flux ratios are consistent within the uncertainties. We discuss the utility
of the current data for studying chromatic effects related to microlensing,
dust extinction, and dark matter substructure.

become synchronized by virtue of the statistical correlations in their noisy
input streams. Recent work has shown that the degree of correlation transfer
from input currents to output spikes depends not only on intrinsic oscillator
dynamics, but also depends on the length of the observation window over which
the correlation is calculated. In this paper we use stochastic phase reduction
and regular perturbations to derive the correlation of the total phase elapsed
over long time scales, a quantity which provides a convenient proxy for the
spike count correlation. Over short time scales, we derive the spike count
correlation directly using straightforward probabilistic reasoning applied to
the density of the phase difference. Our approximations show that output
correlation scales with the autocorrelation of the phase resetting curve over
long time scales. We also find a concise expression for the influence of the
shape of the phase resetting curve on the initial slope of the output
correlation over short time scales. These analytic results together with
numerical simulations provide new intuitions for the recent counterintuitive
finding that type I oscillators transfer correlations more faithfully than do
type II over long time scales, while the reverse holds true for the better
understood case of short time scales.

transmitters and two receivers, in which the cognitive transmitter non-causally
knows the message and codeword of the primary transmitter. We first introduce a
discrete memoryless more capable CIC, which is an extension to the more capable
broadcast channel (BC). Using superposition coding, we propose an inner bound
and an outer bound on its capacity region. The outer bound is also valid when
the primary user is under strong interference. For the Gaussian CIC, this outer
bound applies for $|a| \geq 1 $, where $a$ is the gain of interference link
from secondary user to primary receiver. These capacity inner and outer bounds
are then applied to the Gaussian cognitive Z-interference channel (GCZIC) where
only the primary receiver suffers interference. Upon showing that jointly
Gaussian input maximizes these bounds for the GCZIC, we evaluate the bounds for
this channel. The new outer bound is strictly tighter than other outer bounds
on the capacity of the GCZIC at strong interference ($a^2 \geq 1 $).
Especially, the outer bound coincides with the inner bound for $|a| \geq
\sqrt{1 + P_1}$ and thus, establishes the capacity of the GCZIC at this range.
For such a large $a$, superposition encoding at the cognitive transmitter and
successive decoding at the primary receiver are capacity-achieving.

Lagrangian fluid particle velocity in constant-density shear-driven turbulence,
to variable-density (VD) pressure-gradient-driven flows. VD effects due to
non-uniform mass concentrations (e.g. mixing of different species) are
considered. In the extended model large density fluctuations leading to large
differential fluid accelerations are accounted for. This is an essential
ingredient to represent the strong coupling between the density and velocity
fields in VD hydrodynamics driven by active scalar mixing. The small scale
anisotropy, a fundamentally ""non-Kolmogorovian"" feature of
pressure-gradient-driven flows, is captured by a tensorial stochastic diffusion
term. The extension is so constructed that it reduces to the original Langevin
model in the limit of constant density. We show that coupling a Lagrangian
mass-density particle model to the proposed extended velocity equation results
in a statistical representation of VD turbulence that has important benefits.
Namely, the effects of the mass flux and the specific volume, both essential in
the prediction of VD flows, are retained in closed form and require no explicit
closure assumptions. The paper seeks to describe a theoretical framework
necessary for subsequent applications. We derive the rigorous mathematical
consequences of assuming a particular functional form of the stochastic
momentum equation coupled to the stochastic density field in VD flows. A
previous article discussed VD mixing and developed a stochastic Lagrangian
model equation for the mass-density. Second in the series, this article
develops the momentum equation for VD hydrodynamics. A third, forthcoming paper
will combine these ideas on mixing and hydrodynamics into a comprehensive
framework: it will specify a model for the coupled problem and validate it by
computing a Rayleigh-Taylor flow.

CO2(80%) + N2(20%) gas mixture at 100 and 150 Torr. It was designed to measure
the cross sections of several key nuclear reactions involved in stellar
evolution. In particular, a study of the rate of formation of oxygen and carbon
during the process of helium burning will be performed by exposing the chamber
gas to intense nearly mono-energetic gamma-ray beams at the High Intensity
Gamma Source (HIgS) facility. The O-TPC has a sensitive target-drift volume of
30x30x21 cm^3. Ionization electrons drift towards a double parallel grid
avalanche multiplier, yielding charge multiplication and light emission.
Avalanche induced photons from N2 emission are collected, intensified and
recorded with a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera, providing two-dimensional
track images. The event's time projection (third coordinate) and the deposited
energy are recorded by photomultipliers and by the TPC charge-signal,
respectively. A dedicated VME-based data acquisition system and associated data
analysis tools were developed to record and analyze these data. The O-TPC has
been tested and calibrated with 3.183 MeV alpha-particles emitted by a 148Gd
source placed within its volume with a measured energy resolution of 3.0%.
Tracks of alpha and 12C particles from the dissociation of 16O and of three
alpha-particles from the dissociation of 12C have been measured during initial
in-beam test experiments performed at the HIgS facility at Duke University. The
full detection system and its performance are described and the results of the
preliminary in-beam test experiments are reported.

array data, a problem motivated by database applications and recently solved
for the one-dimensional tree-ordered case. In this paper, one is given a matrix
A whose rows and columns have semantics: special subsets of the rows and
special subsets of the columns are meaningful, others are not. A submatrix in A
is said to be meaningful if and only if it is the cross product of a meaningful
row subset and a meaningful column subset, in which case we call it an ""allowed
rectangle."" The goal is to ""explain"" A as a sparse sum of weighted allowed
rectangles. Specifically, we wish to find as few weighted allowed rectangles as
possible such that, for all i,j, a_{ij} equals the sum of the weights of all
rectangles which include cell (i,j).
  In this paper we consider the natural cases in which the matrix dimensions
are tree-ordered or linearly-ordered. In the tree-ordered case, we are given a
rooted tree T1 whose leaves are the rows of A and another, T2, whose leaves are
the columns. Nodes of the trees correspond in an obvious way to the sets of
their leaf descendants. In the linearly-ordered case, a set of rows or columns
is meaningful if and only if it is contiguous.
  For tree-ordered data, we prove the explanation problem NP-Hard and give a
randomized 2-approximation algorithm for it. For linearly-ordered data, we
prove the explanation problem NP-Hard and give a 2.56-approximation algorithm.
To our knowledge, these are the first results for the problem of sparsely and
exactly representing matrices by weighted rectangles.

the non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment and their fidelity
depends on the number of verifications done to ensure multiple errors will not
propagate into the encoded quantum information. Surprisingly, performing these
verifications may lower the fidelity of the constructed Shor states. The second
encoding method is to simply implement the $[7,1,3]$ encoding gate sequence
also in the non-equiprobable Pauli operator error environment. Perfect error
correction is applied after both methods to determine the correctability of the

on the which of Pauli operator errors is dominant. Nevertheless, perfect error
correction supresses errors to at least first order for both methods.

Owing to the non-linearity of MOND's Poisson equation, beyond tidal effects,
the internal dynamics of clusters is affected by the external field in which
they are immersed. For the studied clusters, particle accelerations are much
lower than the critical acceleration a_0 of MOND, but the motion of stars is
neither dominated by internal accelerations (a_i >> a_e) nor external
accelerations (a_e >> a_i). We use the N-body code N-MODY in our analysis,
which is a particle-mesh-based code with a numerical MOND potential solver
developed by Ciotti, Londrillo, and Nipoti (2006) to derive the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion by adding the external field effect. We show that Newtonian
dynamics predicts a low-velocity dispersion for each cluster, while in modified
Newtonian dynamics the velocity dispersion is much higher. We calculate the
minimum number of measured stars necessary to distinguish between Newtonian
gravity and MOND with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We also show that for most
clusters it is necessary to measure the velocities of between 30 to 80 stars to
distinguish between both cases. Therefore the observational measurement of the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of these clusters will provide a test for
MOND.

rises to 480 km/s at 0.2"". We combine these data with extensive stellar
kinematics out to large radii to derive a black-hole mass equal to
(6.6+-0.4)x10^9 Msun, using orbit-based axisymmetric models and including only
the NIFS data in the central region. Including previously-reported ground-based
data in the central region drops the uncertainty to 0.25x10^9 Msun with no
change in the best-fit mass; however, we rely on the values derived from the
NIFS-only data in the central region in order to limit systematic differences.
The best-fit model shows a significant increase in the tangential velocity
anisotropy of stars orbiting in the central region with decreasing radius;
similar to that seen in the centers of other core galaxies. The black-hole mass
is insensitive to the inclusion of a dark halo in the models --- the high
angular-resolution provided by the adaptive optics breaks the degeneracy
between black-hole mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. The present black-hole
mass is in excellent agreement with the Gebhardt & Thomas value, implying that
the dark halo must be included when the kinematic influence of the black hole
is poorly resolved. This degeneracy implies that the black-hole masses of
luminous core galaxies, where this effect is important, may need to be
re-evaluated. The present value exceeds the prediction of the black
hole-dispersion and black hole-luminosity relations, both of which predict
about 1x10^9 Msun for M87, by close to twice the intrinsic scatter in the
relations. The high-end of the black hole correlations may be poorly determined

during the protostellar phase of high-mass stars. It is still unclear how
magnetic fields influence the formation and dynamics of massive disks and
outflows. Most current information on magnetic fields close to high-mass
protostars comes from polarized maser emissions, which allows us to investigate
the magnetic field on small scales by using very long-baseline interferometry.
The massive star-forming region W75N contains three radio continuum sources
(VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3), at three different evolutionary stages, and associated
masers, while a large-scale molecular bipolar outflow is also present. Very
recently, polarization observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers at
milliarsecond resolution have been able to probe the strength and structure of
the magnetic field over more than 2000 AU around VLA1. The magnetic field is
parallel to the outflow, suggesting that VLA1 is its powering source. The
observations of water masers at 22 GHz can give more information about the gas
dynamics and the magnetic fields around VLA1 and VLA2. The NRAO Very Long
Baseline Array was used to measure the linear polarization and the
Zeeman-splitting of the 22 GHz water masers in the star-forming region W75N. We
detected 124 water masers, 36 around VLA1 and 88 around VLA2 of W75N, which

complete the kinematic coverage to R = 47 kpc. At this radial distance the
logarithmic dark halo comprises 85.3 (+2.5,-2.4) % of the total enclosed mass

circular velocity of 800^(+75)_(-25) kms, and a dark halo scale radius of
36^(+7)_(-3) kpc. The stellar M/L, assuming an NFW dark halo, is well
constrained to 8.20^(+0.05)_(-0.10) (V-band). The stars in M87 are found to be
radially anisotropic out to R ~ 0.5 R_e then isotropic or slightly tangentially
anisotropic to our last stellar data point at R = 2.4 R_e where the anisotropy
of the stars and globular clusters are in excellent agreement. The globular
clusters then become radially anisotropic in the last two modeling bins at R =
3.4 R_e and R = 4.8 R_e. As one of the most massive galaxies in the local

of possible torsion within all norm-composing parallelizable manifolds. A
profound interplay is thus uncovered between the existence and strength of
quantum correlations and the parallelizability of the spheres S^0, S^1, S^3,
and S^7 necessitated by the four real division algebras. In particular,
parallelization within a unit 3-sphere is shown to be responsible for the
existence of EPR and Hardy type correlations, whereas that within a unit
7-sphere is shown to be responsible for the existence of all GHZ type
correlations. Moreover, parallelizability in general is shown to be equivalent
to the completeness criterion of EPR, in addition to necessitating the locality
condition of Bell. It is therefore shown to predetermine both the local
outcomes as well as the quantum correlations among the remote outcomes,
dictated by the infinite factorizability of points within the spheres S^3 and
S^7. The twin illusions of quantum entanglement and non-locality are thus shown
to stem from the topologically incomplete accountings of the measurement

for frameworks that can quickly and automatically produce calibrated
classification probabilities for newly-observed variables based on a small
number of time-series measurements. In this paper, we introduce a methodology
for variable-star classification, drawing from modern machine-learning
techniques. We describe how to homogenize the information gleaned from light
curves by selection and computation of real-numbered metrics (""feature""),
detail methods to robustly estimate periodic light-curve features, introduce
tree-ensemble methods for accurate variable star classification, and show how
to rigorously evaluate the classification results using cross validation. On a
25-class data set of 1542 well-studied variable stars, we achieve a 22.8%
overall classification error using the random forest classifier; this
represents a 24% improvement over the best previous classifier on these data.
This methodology is effective for identifying samples of specific science
classes: for pulsational variables used in Milky Way tomography we obtain a
discovery efficiency of 98.2% and for eclipsing systems we find an efficiency
of 99.1%, both at 95% purity. We show that the random forest (RF) classifier is
superior to other machine-learned methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and
relative immunity to features with no useful class information; the RF
classifier can also be used to estimate the importance of each feature in
classification. Additionally, we present the first astronomical use of
hierarchical classification methods to incorporate a known class taxonomy in
the classifier, which further reduces the catastrophic error rate to 7.8%.
Excluding low-amplitude sources, our overall error rate improves to 14%, with a
catastrophic error rate of 3.5%.

J=5-4, v=1 28SiO and v=0 29SiO masers of VX Sgr are shown to be highly linearly
polarized with a polarization from ~5-60%. Assuming the continuum emission
peaks at the stellar position, the masers are found within ~60 mas of the star,
corresponding to ~100 AU at a distance of 1.57 kpc. The linear polarization
vectors are consistent with a large scale magnetic field, with position and
inclination angles similar to that of the dipole magnetic field inferred in the
H2O and OH maser regions at much larger distances from the star. We thus show
for the first time that the magnetic field structure in a circumstellar
envelope can remain stable from a few stellar radii out to ~1400 AU. This
provides further evidence supporting the existence of large scale and
dynamically important magnetic fields around evolved stars. Due to a lack of
parallactic angle coverage, the linear polarization of masers around W Hya
could not be determined. For both stars we observed the 28SiO and 29SiO
isotopologues and find that they have a markedly different distribution and
that they appear to avoid each other. Additionally, emission from the SO
5_5-4_4 line was imaged for both sources. Around W Hya we find a clear offset
between the red- and blue-shifted SO emission. This indicates that W Hya is
likely host to a slow bipolar outflow or a rotating disk-like structure.

assume a constant mass-to-luminosity ratio and impose the further condition of
a minimum luminosity of 10^{12}Lsol. According to our calibrations with a

Myr). From photometric lightcurves obtained with the Isaac Newton Telescope, we
measure rotation periods for 49 objects, among them 26 in the VLM domain. This
enlarges the period sample in this mass and age regime by a factor of 6. Almost
all VLM objects in our sample are fast rotators with periods <2.5 d, in
contrast to the stars with M>0.6 Msol in this cluster which have periods of
7-14 d. Thus, we confirm that the period-mass distribution in Praesepe exhibits
a radical break at M~0.3-0.6 Msol. Our data indicate a positive period-mass
trend in the VLM regime, similar to younger clusters. In addition, the scatter
of the periods increases with mass. For the M>0.3 Msol objects in our sample
the period distribution is probably affected by binarity. By comparing the
Praesepe periods with literature samples in the cluster NGC2516 (age ~150 Myr)
we constrain the spindown in the VLM regime. An exponential rotational braking
law P ~ exp(t/tau) with a mass-dependent tau is required to reproduce the data.
The spindown timescale tau increases steeply towards lower masses; we derive
tau~0.5 Gyr for 0.3 Msol and >1 Gyr for 0.1 Msol. These constraints are
consistent with the current paradigm of the spindown due to wind braking. We
discuss possible physical origins of this behaviour and prospects for future

we constrain potential progenitors of ESO 185-IG13. The analysis of the star
cluster population is used to investigate the properties of the present
starburst and to date the final merger event, which has produced hundreds of
clusters younger than 100 Myr. We have found a peak of cluster formation only
3.5 Myr old. A large fraction of these clusters will not survive after 10-20
Myr, due to the ""infant mortality"" caused by gas expulsion. However, this
sample of clusters represents an unique chance to investigate the youngest
phases of cluster evolution. As already observed in the analog blue compact
galaxy Haro 11, a fraction of young clusters are affected by a flux excess at
wavelengths longer than 8000 \AA. Ages, masses, and extinctions of clusters
with this NIR excess are estimated from UV and optical data. We discuss
similarities and differences of the observed NIR excess in ESO 185-IG13
clusters with other cases in the literature. The cluster ages and masses are
used to distinguish among the potential causes of the excess. We observe, as in
Haro 11, that the use of the IR and the (commonly used) I band data results in
overestimates of age and mass in clusters affected by the NIR excess. This has
important implications for a number of related studies of star clusters.

generates synchrotron/curvature radiation as the electron-positron plasma in

consistent toy model for quantum gravity in four dimensions.

that quantum states are not descriptions of quantum systems but rather reflect
the assigning agents' epistemic relations to the systems. This idea, which can
be found already in the works of Copenhagen adherents Heisenberg and Peierls,
has received increasing attention in recent years because it promises an
understanding of quantum theory in which neither the measurement problem nor a
conflict between quantum non-locality and relativity theory arises. Here it is
argued that the main challenge for proponents of this idea is to make sense of
the notion of a state assignment being performed correctly without thereby
acknowledging the notion of a true state of a quantum system---a state it is
in. An account based on the epistemic conception of states is proposed that
fulfills this requirement by interpreting the rules governing state assignment
as constitutive rules in the sense of John Searle.

charmed baryons. We show that this effect would imply that the doubly charmed
baryons are very compact. One intriguing possibility is that such baryons have
a linear geometry Q-q-Q where the light quark q oscillates between the two
heavy quarks Q, analogous to a linear molecule such as carbon dioxide. However,
using conventional arguments, the size of a heavy-light hadron is expected to
be around 0.5 fm, much larger than the size needed to explain the observed
large isospin splitting. Assuming the distance between two heavy quarks is much
smaller than that between the light quark and a heavy one, the doubly heavy
baryons are related to the heavy mesons via heavy quark-diquark symmetry. Based
on this symmetry, we predict the isospin splittings for doubly heavy baryons
including Xi_{cc}, Xi_{bb} and Xi_{bc}. The prediction for the Xi_{cc} is much
smaller than the SELEX value. On the other hand, the Xi_{bb} baryons are
predicted to have an isospin splitting as large as (6.3\pm1.7) MeV. An
experimental study of doubly bottomed baryons is therefore very important to
better understand the structure of baryons with heavy quarks.

is investigated from prestellar core stage until sim 10^4 yr after protostar

gravitational instability in a magnetically inactive region, and
substellar-mass objects appear. The substellar-mass objects lose their orbital
angular momenta by gravitational interaction with the massive circumstellar
disk and finally fall onto the protostar. After this fall, the circumstellar
disk increases its mass by mass accretion and again induces fragmentation. The
formation and falling of substellar-mass objects are repeated in the
circumstellar disk until the end of the main accretion phase. In this process,
the mass of fragments remain small, because the circumstellar disk loses its
mass by fragmentation and subsequent falling of fragments before it becomes
very massive. In addition, when fragments orbit near the protostar, they
disturb the inner disk region and promote mass accretion onto the protostar.
The orbital motion of substellar-mass objects clearly synchronizes with the
time variation of the accretion luminosity of the protostar. Moreover, as the
objects fall, the protostar shows a strong brightening for a short duration.
The intermittent protostellar outflows are also driven by the circumstellar
disk whose magnetic field lines are highly tangled owing to the orbital motion
of fragments. The time-variable protostellar luminosity and intermittent
outflows may be a clue for detecting planetary-mass objects in the
circumstellar disk.

data reduction environment which, at its initial phase, will have to
incorporate pipelines from seven different instruments. Therefore, the SOFIA
data reduction software must run code which has been developed in a variety of
dissimilar environments which will only increase in future generations of
instrumentation. We investigated three distinctly different situations for
performing pipelined data reduction in SOFIA: automated data reduction after
data archival at the end of a mission, re-pipelining of science data with
updated calibrations or optimum parameters, and the interactive user-driven
local execution and analysis of data reduction by an investigator. These
different modes would traditionally result in very different software
implementations of algorithms used by each instrument team, in effect tripling
the amount of data reduction software that would need to be maintained by
SOFIA. We present here a unique approach for enfolding all the
instrument-specific data reduction software in the observatory framework and
verifies the needs for all three reduction scenarios as well as the standard
visualization tools. The SOFIA data reduction structure would host the
different algorithms and techniques that the instrument teams develop in their
own environment. Ideally, duplication of software is minimized across the
system because instrument teams can draw on software solutions and techniques
previously delivered to SOFIA by other instruments. With this approach, we
minimize the effort for analyzing and developing new software reduction
pipelines for future generation instruments. We also explore the potential
benefits of this approach in the portability of the software to an
ever-broadening science audience, as well as its ability to ease the use of
distributed processing for data reduction pipelines.

top-down design by decomposing a global task into sub-tasks for each individual
agent such that the accomplishments of these sub-tasks will guarantee the
achievement of the global task. In our previous works [1], [2] we presented
necessary and sufficient conditions on the decomposability of a global task
automaton between cooperative agents. As a follow-up work, this paper deals
with the robustness issues of the proposed top-down design approach with
respect to event failures in the multi-agent systems. The main concern under
event failure is whether a previously decomposable task can still be achieved
collectively by the agents, and if not, we would like to investigate that under
what conditions the global task could be robustly accomplished. This is
actually the fault-tolerance issue of the top-down design, and the results
provide designers with hints on which events are fragile with respect to
failures, and whether redundancies are needed. The main objective of this paper
is to identify necessary and sufficient conditions on failed events under which
a decomposable global task can still be achieved successfully. For such a
purpose, a notion called passivity is introduced to characterize the type of
event failures. The passivity is found to reflect the redundancy of
communication links over shared events, based on which necessary and sufficient
conditions for the reliability of cooperative tasking under event failures are
derived, followed by illustrative examples and remarks for the derived
conditions.

TbCo(0.4)Ge2, undergo magnetic ordering around 17 and 19 K respectively. The
magnetic state of these compouds appears to be antiferromagnetic-like.
Qualitatively, there is a correlation between the field response of the
magnetization (M), the magnetoresistance (MR) and the entropy change curve in
all these compouds. That is, these Tb compounds exhibit a ""positive"" MR and
entropy change beyond a magnetic field where M also shows a field-induced
transition. On the basis of this correlaion, we conclude that magnetic
disorder/fluctuations beyond a critical field - ""a phenomenon called inverse
metamagnetism"" - rather than metamagnetism,is induced in these compounds.

dynamics in which the internal STZ transition rates are characterized by a
broad distribution of activation barriers. For slowly aging or fully aged
systems, the main features of the barrier-height distribution are determined by
the effective temperature and other near-equilibrium properties of the
configurational degrees of freedom. Our theory accounts for the wide range of
relaxation rates observed in both structural glasses and soft glassy materials
such as colloidal suspensions. We find that the frequency dependent loss
modulus is not just a superposition of Maxwell modes. Rather, it exhibits an
$\alpha$ peak that rises near the viscous relaxation rate and, for nearly
jammed, glassy systems, extends to much higher frequencies in accord with
experimental observations. We also use this theory to compute strain recovery
following a period of large, persistent deformation and then abrupt unloading.
We find that strain recovery is determined in part by the initial
barrier-height distribution, but that true structural aging also occurs during
this process and determines the system's response to subsequent perturbations.
In particular, we find by comparison with experimental data that the initial
deformation produces a highly disordered state with a large population of low
activation barriers, and that this state relaxes quickly toward one in which
the distribution is dominated by the high barriers predicted by the
near-equilibrium analysis. The nonequilibrium dynamics of the barrier-height
distribution is the most important of the issues raised and left unresolved in
this paper.

be more vulnerable compared to classical networks with only connectivity links.
Their percolation transition is usually of a first order compared to the second
order transition found in classical networks. We analytically analyze the
effect of different distributions of dependencies links on the robustness of
networks. For a random Erd$\ddot{o}$s-R$\acute{e}$nyi (ER) network with average
degree $k$ that is divided into dependency clusters of size $s$, the fraction
of nodes that belong to the giant component, $P_\infty$, is given by $
P_\infty=p^{s-1} [1-\exp{(-kpP_\infty)}]^s $ where $1-p$ is the initial
fraction of removed nodes. Our general result coincides with the known
Erd$\ddot{o}$s-R$\acute{e}$nyi equation for random networks for $s=1$ and with
the result of Parshani et al (PNAS, in press, 2011) for $s=2$. For networks
with Poissonian distribution of dependency links we find that $P_\infty$ is
given by $P_\infty = f_{k,p}(P_\infty) e^{(<s>-1)(pf_{k,p}(P_\infty)-1)}$ where
$f_{k,p}(P_\infty) \equiv 1-\exp{(-kpP_\infty)}$ and $<s>$ is the mean value of
the size of dependency clusters. For networks with Gaussian distribution of
dependency links we show how the average and width of the distribution affect
the robustness of the networks.

transition results from the condensation of two soft modes that have the same
symmetry and are strongly coupled anharmonically. Further, the leading
instability mode essentially consists of rotations of the oxygen octahedra that
are the basic building block of the perovskite structure; remarkably, because
of the particular topology of the lattice, such O6 rotations give raise to a
spontaneous polarization in LTO. The effects discussed thus constitute an
example of how nano-structuring -- provided here by the natural layering of LTO
-- makes it possible to obtain a significant polar character in structural
distortions that are typically non-polar. We discuss the implications of our
findings as regards the design of novel multifunctional materials. Indeed, the
observed proper ferroelectricity driven by O6 rotations provides the ideal
conditions to obtain strong magnetoelectric effects.

  Supplement",,,,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we consider quantum electromagnetic fields in an expanding
universe. We start by reviewing the difficulties found when trying to impose
the Lorenz condition in a time-dependent geometry. Motivated by this fact, we
explore the possibility of extending the electromagnetic theory by allowing the
scalar state which is usually eliminated by means of the Lorenz condition to
propagate, preserving at the same time the dynamics of ordinary transverse
photons. We show that the new state cannot be generated by charged currents,
but it breaks conformal invariance and can be excited gravitationally. In fact,
primordial quantum fluctuations produced during inflation can give rise to
super-Hubble temporal electromagnetic modes whose energy density behaves as a
cosmological constant. The value of the effective cosmological constant is
shown to agree with observations provided inflation took place at the
electroweak scale. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests
and is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, not only
the true nature of dark energy can be established without resorting to new
physics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural
explanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. On sub-Hubble
scales, the new state generates an effective charge density which, due to the
high electric conductivity of the cosmic plasma after inflation, gives rise to
both vorticity and magnetic fields. Present upper limits on vorticity coming
from CMB anisotropies are translated into lower limits on the present value of
cosmic magnetic fields. We find that magnetic fields $B_{\lambda}> 10^{-12}$ G
can be typically generated with coherence lengths ranging from sub-galactic
scales up to the present Hubble radius.

cluster Abell 1367. The sample galaxies are distributed from the cluster centre
out to approximately half the cluster Abell radius. The optical/near-infrared
colours are compared with simple stellar population synthesis models from which
the luminosity-weighted stellar population ages and metallicities are
determined. The locus of the colours of elliptical galaxies traces a sequence
of varying metallicity at a narrow range of luminosity-weighted stellar ages.
Lenticular galaxies in the red sequence, however, exhibit a substantial spread
of luminosity-weighted stellar metallicities and ages. For red sequence
lenticular galaxies and blue cloud galaxies, low mass galaxies tend to be on
average dominated by stellar populations of younger luminosity-weighted ages.
Sample galaxies exhibit a strong correlation between integrated stellar mass
and luminosity-weighted stellar metallicity. Galaxies with signs of
morphological disturbance and ongoing star formation activity, tend to be
underabundant with respect to passive galaxies in the red sequence of
comparable stellar masses. We argue that this could be due to tidally-driven
gas flows toward the star-forming regions, carrying less enriched gas and
diluting the pre-existing gas to produce younger stellar populations with lower
metallicities than would be obtained prior to the interaction. Finally, we find
no statistically significant evidence for changes in the luminosity-weighted
ages and metallicities for either red sequence or blue cloud galaxies, at fixed
stellar mass, with location within the cluster.

sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott
insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged
atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing
selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly
monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice
prepared along a single line and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the
atoms in the motional ground state. Our results open the path to a wide range
of novel applications from quantum dynamics of spin impurities, entropy
transport, implementation of novel cooling schemes, and engineering of quantum
many-body phases to quantum information processing.

Recombination is the genetic mechanism by which two parent individuals create
the mixed type of their offspring during sexual reproduction. The corresponding
models are large, nonlinear dynamical systems (for the deterministic treatment
that applies in the infinite-population limit), or interacting particle systems
(for the stochastic treatment required for finite populations). We review
recent progress on these difficult problems. In particular, we present a closed
solution of the deterministic continuous-time system, for the important special
case of single crossovers; we extract an underlying linearity; we analyse how
this carries over to the corresponding stochastic setting; and we provide a
solution of the analogous deterministic discrete-time dynamics, in terms of its
generalised eigenvalues and a simple recursion for the corresponding

other types of galaxies, both at high and low redshift. This is needed in order

gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters to probe the faint and abundant
submillimeter galaxy population down to a lower flux density level than what
can be achieved in blank-field observations. Methods: We use the LABOCA
bolometer camera on the APEX telescope to observe five cluster of galaxies at a
wavelength of 870 micron. The final maps have an angular resolution of 27.5
arcsec and a point source noise level of 1.2-2.2 mJy. We model the mass
distribution in the clusters as superpositions of spherical NFW halos and
derive magnification maps that we use to calculate intrinsic flux densities as
well as area-weighted number counts. We also use the positions of Spitzer MIPS
24 micron sources in four of the fields for a stacking analysis. Results: We
detected 37 submm sources, out of which 14 have not been previously reported.
One source has a sub-mJy intrinsic flux density. The derived number counts are
consistent with previous results, after correction for gravitational
magnification and completeness levels. The stacking analysis reveals an
intrinsic 870 micron signal of 390 \pm 27 microJy at 14.5 sigma significance.
We study the S_{24 micron} - S_{870 micron} relation by stacking on subsamples
of the 24 micron sources and find a linear relation at S_{24 micron} < 300
microJy, followed by a flattening at higher 24 micron flux densities. The
signal from the significantly detected sources in the maps accounts for 13% of
the Extragalactic Background Light discovered by COBE, and the stacked signal
accounts for 11%.

brane,localized in matter direction at any arbitrary point. It appears that in
order to have an appropriate string/MQM correspondence we must need to impose a
constraint on the matrix model side which is equivalent to an operator
constraint on the matter part of the boundary state that arises from open
string boundary condition. This condition constrains the Hilbert space
generated by the macroscopic loop operator but the bulk matrix model remains
unaffected, thereby describing a situation parallel to string theory. We have
analyzed the constrained theory with uncompactified as well as compactified
time and have shown that it is in good agreement with string theory. Without
this constraint, the grand canonical partition function for MQM on a circle in
the presence of the brane diverges while the constrained partition function is
finite and corresponds to that of a deformed Fermi surface, as expected within
the compactified theory. Matrix model path integral on a circle in the presence
of the brane is expressed as Fredholm determinant. We consider matrix model in
the presence of the brane, to be perturbed by momentum modes. We obtain the
expression of MQM wave function in this background from collective field theory
analysis. We have shown with the help of this constraint that the grand
canonical partition function has an integrable structure and can be expressed
as tau function of Toda hierarchy. Finally we have analyzed the dispersionless
limit.

model for the maximal set of sensor nodes that sense a point event and forms a
cluster with fully connected network between them. We determine the minimal set
of sensor nodes that are sufficient to give approximately the same data
accuracy achieve by the maximal set of sensor nodes. Design
approach/Procedure-L set of sensor nodes are randomly deployed over a region Z.
Since a point event S has occurred in the region Z, M maximal set of sensor
nodes wake up and start sensing the point event. The set of M sensor nodes
forms a cluster with fully connected network and remaining set of sensor nodes
continue to be in sleep mode. One sensor node is elected randomly as a cluster
head (CH) node which can estimate the data accuracy for the cluster before data
aggregation and finally send the data to the sink node. Findings - Since we
simulate the data accuracy for the cluster (M set of sensor nodes) at CH node,
there exist P minimal set of sensor nodes which give approximately the same
data accuracy level achieve by M set of sensor nodes .Moreover we find that as
the distance from the point event to the number of sensor nodes increases, the
data accuracy also get decreases. Design Limitation -This model is only
applicable to estimate data accuracy for the point event where the sensed data

performed for the cluster before data aggregation at the CH node which can
reduce data redundancy and communication overhead.

large variety of icy bodies showing great diversity in orbital behavior, size,
surface color and composition. One can also note the presence of dynamical
families and binary systems. One surprising feature detected in the spectra of
some of the largest Trans-Neptunians is the presence of crystalline water-ice.
This is the case for the large TNO (136 108) Haumea (2003 EL61). Aims. We seek
to constrain the state of the water ice of Haumea and its satellites, and
investigate possible energy sources to maintain the water ice in its
crystalline form. Methods. Spectro-imaging observations in the near infrared
have been performed with the integral field spectrograph SINFONI mounted on UT4
at the ESO Very Large Telescope. The spectra of both Haumea and its larger
satellite Hi'iaka are analyzed. Relative astrometry of the components is also
performed, providing a check of the orbital solutions and equinox seasons.
Results. We describe the physical characteristics of the crystalline water-ice
present on the surface of Haumea and its largest satellite Hi'iaka and analyze
possible sources of heating to maintain water in crystalline state: tidal
dissipation in the system components vs radiogenic source. The surface of
Hi'iaka appears to be covered by large grains of water ice, almost entirely in
its crystalline form. Under some restricted conditions, both radiogenic heating
and tidal forces between Haumea and Hi'iaka could provide the energy sufficient
to maintain the ice in its crystalline state.

reduced the scatter in individual line radial velocity measurements from ~ 3 to
< 1 km/s. We present revised abundances of O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe based on a
critical review of line broadening parameters and oscillator strengths. The new
measurements are generally in agreement with our previous analysis with the
exception of magnesium with a revised abundance a factor of two lower than
previously estimated. The magnesium, silicon and iron abundances exceed solar
abundances, but the oxygen and calcium abundances are below solar. Also, we
compared the observed line profiles to synthetic spectra computed with variable
accretion rates and vertical abundance distributions assuming diffusive
steady-state. The inferred accretion rates vary from dM/dt = 2x10^6 for calcium
to 2x10^9 g/s for oxygen. We find that the accretion flow must be oxygen-rich

radial velocity variations between two measurement epochs suggests that GALEX

amenable to the lubrication approximation is considered. It is shown that the
Helfrich energy of the layer gives rise to additional terms in the
time-evolution equations of the liquid film. The dynamics is found to depend on
the absolute value of the spontaneous curvature, irrespective of its sign. Due
to the additional terms, a novel finite wavelength instability of flat rigid
interfaces can be observed. Furthermore, the dependence of the shape of a

demonstrate a technique to determine subdiffraction distances based on the near

scattering cross section, not only distances but also relative orientations can
be measured. Gold nanoparticles were prepared on glass in such way that a small
fraction of dimers was present. The sample was sequentially illuminated with
two wavelengths to separate background from nanoparticle scattering based on
their spectral properties. A novel total internal reflection illumination
scheme in which the polarization can be rotated was used to further minimize
background contributions. In this way, radii, distance and orientation were
measured for each individual dimer and their statistical distributions were
found to be in agreement with the expected ones. We envision that this
technique will allow fast and long term tracking of relative distance and
orientation in biological processes.

the test observations of nonvariable stars, we show that the atmospheric
turbulence introduces no significant distortions into the measured light
curves. Therefore, the data obtained in this way are well suited for studying
the aperiodic variability of various objects.
  The large amount of SS 433 optical light curve measurements obtained in this
way allowed us to obtain the power spectra of its flux variability with a
record sensitivity up to frequencies of ~0.5 Hz and to detect its break at
frequency =~2.4e-3 Hz. We suggest that this break in the power spectrum results
from the smoothing of the optical flux variability due to a finite size of the
emitting region. Based on our measurement of the break frequency in the power
spectrum, we estimated the size of the accretion-disk photosphere as 2e12 cm.
We show that the amplitude of the variability in SS 433 decreases sharply
during accretion-disk eclipses, but it does not disappear completely. This
suggests that the size of the variable optical emission source is comparable to
that of the normal star whose size is therefore R_O \approx 2e12 cm \approx 30

presence of a nonvariable optical emission component with a magnitude

commonly known as type-II and type-III seesaw, are calculated using full 2-loop
RGEs and minimal Supergravity boundary conditions. The type-II seesaw is
realized using one pair of 15 and $\bar{15}$ superfields, while the type-III is
realized using three copies of $24_M$ superfields. Using published, estimated
errors on SUSY mass observables attainable at the LHC and in a combined LHC+ILC
analysis, we calculate expected errors for the parameters of the models, most
notably the seesaw scale. If SUSY particles are within the reach of the ILC,
pure mSugra can be distinguished from mSugra plus type-II or type-III seesaw
for nearly all relevant values of the seesaw scale. Even in the case when only
the much less accurate LHC measurements are used, we find that indications for
the seesaw can be found in favourable parts of the parameter space. Since our
conclusions crucially depend on the reliability of the theoretically forecasted
error bars, we discuss in some detail the accuracies which need to be achieved
for the most important LHC and ILC observables before an analysis, such as the
one presented here, can find any hints for type-II or type-III seesaw in SUSY
spectra.

extensively, culminating in a result of Miller demonstrating that a Stiefel
manifold splits stably to a wedge of Thom spaces over Grassmannians.
Equivariantly, one can consider spaces of isometries between representations as
an analogue to Stiefel manifolds. This concept, however, yields a different
theory to the non-equivariant case. We first construct a variation on the
theory of the functional calculus before studying the homotopy-theoretic
properties of this theory. This allows us to construct the main result; a
natural tower of G-spectra running down from equivariant isometries which
manifests the pieces of the non-equivariant splitting in the form of the
homotopy cofibres of the tower. Furthermore, we detail extra topological
properties and special cases of this theory, developing explicit expressions
covering the tower's geometric and topological structure. We conclude with two
detailed conjectures which provide an avenue for future study. Firstly we
explore how our theory interacts with the splitting of Miller, proving partial
results linking in our work with Miller's and conjecturing even deeper
connections. Finally, we begin to calculate the equivariant K-theory of the
tower, conjecturing and providing evidence towards the idea that the rich
topological structure will be mirrored on the K-theory level by a similarly
deep algebraic structure.

experiment was performed using the heavy ion storage ring TSR located at the
Max-Planck-Institut fur Kernphysik in Heidelberg, Germany. The storage ring
approach allows nearly all metastable levels to relax to the ground state
before data collection begins. We find that the cross section for single
ionization is 30% smaller than was previously measured in a single pass
experiment using an ion beam with an unknown metastable fraction. We also find
some significant differences between our experimental cross section for single
ionization and recent distorted wave (DW) calculations. The DW Maxwellian EISI
rate coefficient for Fe^11+ forming Fe^12+ may be underestimated by as much as
25% at temperatures for which Fe^11+ is abundant in collisional ionization
equilibrium. This is likely due to the absence of 3s excitation-autoionization
(EA) in the calculations. However, a precise measurement of the cross section
due to this EA channel was not possible because this process is not
distinguishable experimentally from electron impact excitation of an n=3
electron to levels of n > 44 followed by field ionization in the charge state
analyzer after the interaction region. Our experimental results also indicate
that the double ionization cross section is dominated by the indirect process
in which direct single ionization of an inner shell 2l electron is followed by
autoionization resulting in a net double ionization.

case of a superposition of two ideal cosmic fluids, as well as the particular
cases of non-interacting and interacting ones, by introducing a
phenomenological coupling function $q(t)$. For two-fluid cosmological scenarios
there exist only cosmological scaling solutions, while for three-fluid
configurations there exist not only cosmological scaling ones, but also more
general solutions. In the case of triply interacting cosmic fluids we can have
energy transfer from two fluids to a third one, or energy transfer from one
cosmic fluid to the other two. It is shown that by requiring the positivity of
energy densities there always is a matter component which violates the dominant
energy condition in this kind of anisotropic cosmological scenarios.

Casimir force are derived that take surface imperfections into account. Using
these expressions we show that surface imperfections can both increase and
decrease the magnitude of the Casimir force up to a few tens of percent when
compared with the case of a perfectly spherical lens. We demonstrate that the
Casimir force between a perfectly spherical lens and a plate described by the
Drude model can be made approximately equal to the force between a sphere with
some surface imperfection and a plate described by the plasma model, and vice
versa. In the case of a metallic sphere and semiconductor plate, approximately
the same Casimir forces are obtained for four different descriptions of charge
carriers in the semiconductor if appropriate surface imperfections on the lens
surface are present. The conclusion is made that there is a fundamental problem
in the interpretation of measurement data for the Casimir force, obtained by
using spherical lenses of centimeter-size radii, and their comparison with

slices as well as anesthetized and awake brains, suggesting that the brain
operates near criticality, i.e. within a narrow margin between avalanche
propagation and extinction. In theory, criticality provides many desirable
features for the behaving brain, optimizing computational capabilities,
information transmission, sensitivity to sensory stimuli and size of memory
repertoires. However, a thorough characterization of neuronal avalanches in
freely-behaving (FB) animals is still missing, thus raising doubts about their
relevance for brain function. To address this issue, we employed chronically
implanted multielectrode arrays (MEA) to record avalanches of spikes from the
cerebral cortex (V1 and S1) and hippocampus (HP) of 14 rats, as they
spontaneously traversed the wake-sleep cycle, explored novel objects or were
subjected to anesthesia (AN). We then modeled spike avalanches to evaluate the
impact of sparse MEA sampling on their statistics. We found that the size
distribution of spike avalanches are well fit by lognormal distributions in FB
animals, and by truncated power laws in the AN group. The FB data are also
characterized by multiple key features compatible with criticality in the
temporal domain, such as 1/f spectra and long-term correlations as measured by
detrended fluctuation analysis. These signatures are very stable across waking,
slow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep, but collapse during anesthesia.
Likewise, waiting time distributions obey a single scaling function during all
natural behavioral states, but not during anesthesia. Results are equivalent
for neuronal ensembles recorded from V1, S1 and HP. Altogether, the data
provide a comprehensive link between behavior and brain criticality, revealing
a unique scale-invariant regime of spike avalanches across all major behaviors.

using an axisymmetric decomposition of velocity and passive scalar structure
functions. The passive scalar is more anisotropic than the velocity field, and
its power spectrum follows a spectral law consistent with $\sim
k_\perp^{-3/2}$. This scaling is explained with phenomenological arguments that
consider the effect of rotation. Intermittency is characterized using scaling
exponents and probability density functions of velocity and passive scalar
increments. In the presence of rotation, intermittency in the velocity field
decreases more noticeably than in the passive scalar. The scaling exponents
show good agreement with Kraichnan's prediction for passive scalar
intermittency in two-dimensions, after correcting for the observed scaling of
the second order exponent.
