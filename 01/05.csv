$e^+e^- \to \Upsilon(1S) \pi^+\pi^-,\Upsilon(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ near the peak of

additional state at a mass of 10.90 GeV and a width of about 28 MeV, in broad
agreement with the state $Y_b(10890)$ GeV seen by Belle in the exclusive final

to be co-spatial with bright penumbral filaments and occupy an area greater

that this phenomenon is driven by dynamic and energetic physical processes in
the inner penumbra which affect the overlying chromosphere and thus provide new
insights for numerical models of sunspots.

emergent complexity in new product development (NPD) projects. A model-driven
approach is taken and mathematical models of cooperative work are formulated
based on the theory of vector-autoregressive (VAR)and hidden Marvov
(HM)processes. To validate the models with field data, a case study was carried
out in an industrial company. Furthermore, concepts and measures of complex
systems science are analyzed. To evaluate emergent complexity in NPD projects,
an information-theory measure-termed ""effective measure complexity"" (EMC)- is
chosen, because it can be derived from first principles and can be calculated
efficiently. EMC measures the mutual information between the infinite past and
future histories of a stochastic process. According to this principle, EMC is
of particular interest for evaluating time-dependent complexity. The formulated
VAR and HM models provide the base for the calculation of several closed-form
solutions of EMC, solutions that allow an explicit complexity assessment based
on the model's independent parameters. Finally, the theoretical complexity
analyses are elucidated in practical terms through an applied example of
optimizing project organization design. The objective is to minimize emergent
complexity by choosing the ""best"" team design from within a predefined group of
developers with different productivities in a simulated NPD project. The
application shows that EMC is not only a highly satisfactory quantity in theory
but it has also leads to useful results in organizational optimization.

enrichment of the Fleming-Viot dynamics with mutation and selection (TFVMS)
consists of marked ultrametric measure spaces, equipped with the marked
Gromov-weak topology and a suitable notion of polynomials as a separating
algebra of test functions. The construction and study of the TFVMS is based on
a well-posed martingale problem. For existence, we use approximating finite
population models, the tree-valued Moran models, while uniqueness follows from
duality to a function-valued process. Path properties of the resulting process
carry over from the neutral case due to absolute continuity, given by a new
Girsanov-type theorem on marked metric measure spaces. To study the long-time
behavior of the process, we use a duality based on ideas from Dawson and Greven

conjecture dates back to the early 1970s and is the most well known and
important open problem in the field of chemical reaction network theory. The
resolution of the conjecture has important biological and mathematical
implications in both the deterministic and stochastic settings. One of our main
analytical tools, which is introduced here, will be a method for partitioning
the relevant monomials of the dynamical system along sequences of trajectory
points into classes with comparable growths. We will use this method to
conclude that if a trajectory converges to the boundary, then a whole family of
Lyapunov functions decrease along the trajectory. This will allow us to
overcome the fact that the usual Lyapunov functions of chemical reaction
network theory are bounded on the boundary of the positive orthant, which has
been the technical sticking point to a proof of the Global Attractor Conjecture
in the past.

  We give a multiplicative version of the classical drift theorem. This allows
easier analyses in those settings where the optimization progress is roughly
proportional to the current distance to the optimum.
  To display the strength of this tool, we regard the classical problem how the
(1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm optimizes an arbitrary linear pseudo-Boolean
function. Here, we first give a relatively simple proof for the fact that any
linear function is optimized in expected time $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the
length of the bit string. Afterwards, we show that in fact any such function is
optimized in expected time at most ${(1+o(1)) 1.39 \euler n\ln (n)}$, again
using multiplicative drift analysis. We also prove a corresponding lower bound
of ${(1-o(1))e n\ln(n)}$ which actually holds for all functions with a unique
global optimum.

(with better constants) for the best known runtime bounds for the (1+1)

Although we consider a fairly general class of energies, our main focus is on
the Willmore energy, i.e. the total squared mean curvature Our purpose is to
address the delicate task of approximating global minimizers of the energy
under boundary constraints.
  The main contribution of this work is to translate the nonlinear boundary
value problem into an integer linear program, using a natural formulation
involving pairs of elementary triangles chosen in a pre-specified dictionary
and allowing self-intersection.
  Our work focuses essentially on the connection between the integer linear
program and its relaxation. We prove that: - One cannot guarantee the total
unimodularity of the constraint matrix, which is a sufficient condition for the
global solution of the relaxed linear program to be always integral, and
therefore to be a solution of the integer program as well; - Furthermore, there
are actually experimental evidences that, in some cases, solving the relaxed
problem yields a fractional solution. Due to the very specific structure of the
constraint matrix here, we strongly believe that it should be possible in the
future to design ad-hoc integer solvers that yield high-definition
approximations to solutions of several boundary value problems involving mean
curvature, in particular the Willmore boundary value problem.

been formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Originally formulated
in 1957, the QAP is one of the most difficult of all combinatorial optimization
problems. Here, we use statistical mechanical methods to study the asymptotic
behavior of problems in which the entries of at least one of the two matrices
that specify the problem are chosen from a random distribution $P$.
Surprisingly, this case has not been studied before using statistical methods
despite the fact that the QAP was first proposed over 50 years ago
\cite{Koopmans}. We find simple forms for $C_{\rm min}$ and $C_{\rm max}$, the
costs of the minimal and maximum solutions respectively. Notable features of
our results are the symmetry of the results for $C_{\rm min}$ and $C_{\rm max}$
and the dependence on $P$ only through its mean and standard deviation,
independent of the details of $P$. After the asymptotic cost is determined for
a given QAP problem, one can straightforwardly calculate the asymptotic cost of
a QAP problem specified with a different random distribution $P$.

supernova explosions following the collapse of a dying star [2], and
hydrodynamic transport of the quark-gluon plasma governed the expansion of the
early Universe [3]. However, our understanding of non-equilibrium dynamics in
such strongly interacting fermionic matter is still limited. Ultracold gases of
fermionic atoms realize a pristine model for such systems and can be studied in
real time with the precision of atomic physics [4, 5]. It has been established
that even above the superfluid transition such gases flow as an almost perfect
fluid with very low viscosity [3, 6] when interactions are tuned to a
scattering resonance. However, here we show that spin currents, as opposed to
mass currents, are maximally damped, and that interactions can be strong enough
to reverse spin currents, with opposite spin components reflecting off each
other. We determine the spin drag coeffcient, the spin diffusivity, and the
spin susceptibility, as a function of temperature on resonance and show that
they obey universal laws at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the spin
diffusivity approaches a minimum value set by the ratio of the reduced Planck's
constant to the atomic mass. For repulsive interactions, our measurements
appear to exclude a metastable ferromagnetic state [7-9].

can limit crystal size by transfer of radiofrequency drive energy into thermal
energy. We also compare the axial component of micromotion, which leads to
first-order Doppler shifts along the preferred spectroscopy axis in precision
measurements on large Coulomb crystals. Finally, we compare trapping potential
anharmonicity, which can induce nonlinear resonance heating by shifting normal
mode frequencies onto resonance as a crystal grows. We apply a non-deforming
crystal approximation for simple calculation of these anharmonicity-induced
shifts, allowing a straightforward estimation of when crystal growth can lead
to excitation of different nonlinear heating resonances. In the axial
micromotion and anharmonicity points of comparison, we find significant

variants thereof in the Weihrauch lattice. For this purpose we first introduce
the concept of a derivative or jump in this lattice and we show that it has
some properties similar to the Turing jump. Using this concept we prove that
the derivative of closed choice of a computable metric space is the cluster
point problem of that space. By specialization to sequences with a relatively
compact range we obtain a characterization of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
as the derivative of compact choice. In particular, this shows that the
Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on real numbers is the jump of Weak K\""onig's
Lemma. Likewise, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on the binary space is the
jump of the lesser limited principle of omniscience LLPO and the
Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on natural numbers can be characterized as the jump
of the idempotent closure of LLPO. We also introduce the compositional product
of two Weihrauch degrees f and g as the supremum of the composition of any two
functions below f and g, respectively. We can express the main result such that
the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem is the compositional product of Weak K\""onig's
Lemma and the Monotone Convergence Theorem. We also study the class of weakly
limit computable functions, which are functions that can be obtained by
composition of weakly computable functions with limit computable functions. We
prove that the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on real numbers is complete for this
class. Likewise, the unique cluster point problem on real numbers is complete
for the class of functions that are limit computable with finitely many mind
changes. We also prove that the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on real numbers
and, more generally, the unbounded cluster point problem on real numbers is
uniformly low limit computable. Finally, we also discuss separation techniques.

Leray showed that the Navier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions have a

equations with compact support in spacetime. Caffarelli, Kohn and Nirenberg
improved Scheffer's results, and F.-H. Lin simplified the proof of the results

the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are described in the books of Bertozzi
and Majda, Constantin or Lemari\'e-Rieusset. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes and
Euler equations with initial conditions (Cauchy problem) for 2D and 3D cases
were obtained in the convergence series form by analytical iterative method
using Fourier and Laplace transforms in paper $\cite{TT10}$. These solutions
were received in a form of infinitely differentiable functions, and that allows
us to analyze all aspects of the problem on a much deeper level and with more
details. Also such smooth solutions satisfy the conditions required in
$\cite{CF06}$ for the problem of Navier-Stokes equations. For several
combinations of problem parameters numerical results were obtained and
presented as graphs $\cite{TT10}$,$\;\cite{TT11}$. This paper describes
detailed proof of convergence of the analitical iterative method for solution
of the Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier - Stokes equations. The convergence is
shown for wide ranges of the problem's parameters. Estimated formula for the
border of convergence area of the iterative process in the space of system

Nevertheless, we show that ISR can also be valuable, yielding information that
can help in the discovery and interpretation of physics beyond the Standard
Model. To access this information we will introduce new techniques designed to
identify ISR jets on an event-by-event basis, a process we term ISR tagging. As
a demonstration of their utility, we will apply these techniques to SUSY
di-squark (di-gluino) production to show that they can be used to identify ISR

an accretion disk. During the past several years, it has become possible to
obtain measurements of the spins of the two classes of black holes by modeling
the X-ray emission from their accretion disks. Two methods are employed, both
of which depend upon identifying the inner radius of the accretion disk with
the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), whose radius depends only on the
mass and spin of the black hole. In the Fe K method, which applies to both

models the thermal X-ray continuum spectrum of the accretion disk. We discuss

galaxy evolution, but despite intense, recent interest in feedback between AGNs
and their hosts, the impact of environment on these relationships remains
poorly constrained. We present results from a study of AGNs and their host
galaxies found in low-redshift galaxy clusters. We fit model spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) to the combined visible and mid-infrared (MIR) photometry
of cluster members and use these model SEDs to determine stellar masses and
star-formation rates (SFRs). We identify two populations of AGNs, the first
based on their X-ray luminosities (X-ray AGNs) and the second based on the
presence of a significant AGN component in their model SEDs (IR AGNs). We find
that the two AGN populations are nearly disjoint; only 8 out of 44 AGNs are
identified with both techniques. We further find that IR AGNs are hosted by
galaxies with similar masses and SFRs but higher specific SFRs (sSFRs) than
X-ray AGN hosts. The relationship between AGN accretion and host star-formation
in cluster AGN hosts shows no significant difference compared to the
relationship between field AGNs and their hosts. The projected radial
distributions of both AGN populations are consistent with the distribution of
other cluster members. We argue that the apparent dichotomy between X-ray and
IR AGNs can be understood as a combination of differing extinction due to cold
gas in the host galaxies of the two classes of AGNs and the presence of weak
star-formation in X-ray AGN hosts.

constant mean {\it volume} density in the central regions of molecular clouds
of constant mean {\it surface} density steepens the mass function from clouds

surface density of molecular clouds is approximately constant, while there is a
growing body of evidence, in both Galactic and extragalactic environments, that
efficient star-formation requires a hydrogen molecule number density threshold

radius distribution steepens from clouds (clumps) to embedded-clusters, which
contributes to explaining observed cluster radius distributions. [Abridged]

emission line fluxes of the hosts of long gamma-ray bursts can result in
improved understanding of the dust properties in these galaxies. In particular,
we find that even with modest signal to noise spectroscopy we can differentiate
different values for R_V, the ratio of total to selective extinction. The
inclusion of Paschen and Brackett lines, even at low signal to noise, greatly
increase the accuracy of the derived reddening. This method is often associated
with strong systematic errors, caused by the need for multiple instruments to
cover the wide wavelength range, the requirement to separate stellar hydrogen
absorption from the nebular emission, and because of the dependancy of the
predicted line fluxes on the electron temperature. We show how these three
systematic errors can be negated, by using suitable instrumentation (in
particular X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope) and wide wavelength coverage.
We demonstrate this method using an extensive optical and near-infrared
spectroscopic campaign of the host galaxy of gamma-ray burst 060218 (SN

there can be substantial misalignments at larger radii (r ~ r_200).
Misalignments of > 45 deg are seen in ~ 30% of our sample. We find that the
satellite population aligns with the shape (and angular momentum) of the outer
dark matter halo. However, the alignment with the galaxy is weak owing to the
mismatch between the disc and dark matter halo. Roughly 20% of the satellite
systems with ten bright galaxies within r_200 exhibit a polar spatial alignment
with respect to the galaxy --- an orientation reminiscent of the classical
satellites of the Milky Way. We find that a small fraction (~10%) of satellite
systems show evidence for rotational support which we attribute to group
infall. There is a bias towards satellites on prograde orbits relative to the
spin of the dark matter halo (and to a lesser extent with the angular momentum
of the disc). This preference towards co-rotation is stronger in the inner
regions of the halo where the most massive satellites accreted at relatively
early times are located. We attribute the anisotropic spatial distribution and
angular momentum bias of the satellites at z=0 to their directional accretion
along the major axes of the dark matter halo. The satellite galaxies have been
accreted relatively recently compared to the dark matter mass and have
experienced less phase-mixing and relaxation --- the memory of their accretion
history can remain intact to z=0.

in microwave (GHz) coplanar waveguide resonators consisting of superconducting
MoGe films interrupted by a gap that is bridged by one or more suspended
superconducting nanowires. This regime, which involve MHz-frequency
oscillations in the amplitude of the supercurrent in the resonator, are
achieved when the steady-state amplitude of the current in the driven resonator
exceeds the critical current of the nanowires. Thus we are able to determine
the temperature dependence of the critical current, which agrees well with the
corresponding Bardeen formula. The pulsing regime manifests itself as an
apparent ""crater"" on top of the fundamental Lorentzian peak of the resonator.
Once the pulsing regime is achieved at a fixed drive power, however, it remains
stable for a range of drive frequencies corresponding to subcritical steady
state currents in the resonator. We develop a phenomenological model of
resonator-nanowire systems, from which we are able to obtain a quantitative
description of the amplitude oscillations and also, inter alia, to investigate
thermal relaxation processes in superconducting nanowires. For the case of
resonators comprising two parallel nanowires and subject to an external
magnetic field, we find field-driven oscillations of the onset power for the
amplitude oscillations, as well as the occurrence (for values of the magnetic
field that strongly frustrate the nanowires) of a distinct steady state in
which the pulsing is replaced by stochastic amplitude-fluctuations. We conclude
by giving a brief discussion of how circuit-QED-based systems have the
potential to facilitate understanding of quantum phase-slips in superconducting

polarization dominates the dielectric properties of the magnetosphere. The
latter is a good approximation if the pair multiplicity is not much larger than
unity. Phase-averaged polarimetry is able to provide a clear signature of the
magnetospheric reprocessing of thermal photons and to constrain mechanisms
generating the thermal emission. Phase-resolved polarimetry, in addition, can
characterize the spatial extent and magnitude of the magnetospheric twist angle
at ~100 stellar radii, and discern between uni- or bidirectional particle
energy distributions, almost independently of every other parameter in the
system. We discuss prospects for detectability with GEMS.

emission lines. Quasars were found in the 1960s, and their spectra were
dominated by powerful continuum radiation which was subsequently identified
with optically thick thermal radiation from copious accretion flows, as well as
high ionization narrow emission lines, and powerful broad permitted lines. By
the 1980s, data from optical polarization and statistics of the radio
properties required that many radio galaxies contain hidden quasar nuclei,
hidden from the line of sight by dusty, roughly toroidal gas distributions. The
radio galaxies with hidden quasars are referred to as ""thermal."" Do all radio
galaxies have powerful hidden quasars? We now know the answer using arguments
based on radio, infrared, optical and X-ray properties. Near the top of the
radio luminosity function, for FRII, GPS, and CSS galaxies, the answer is yes.
Below the top of the radio luminosity function, many do not. At low radio
luminosities, most do not. Instead these ""nonthermal"" weakly-accreting galaxies
are powerful emitters of kinetic energy in the form of synchrotron jets. They

from $G$ to $H$) is a function from the vertices of $G$ to the vertices of $H$
that preserves adjacency. $H$-colourings generalize such graph theory notions
as proper colourings and independent sets.
  For a given $H$, $k \in V(H)$ and $G$ we consider the proportion of vertices
of $G$ that get mapped to $k$ in a uniformly chosen $H$-colouring of $G$. Our
main result concerns this quantity when $G$ is regular and bipartite. We find
numbers $0 \leq a^-(k) \leq a^+(k) \leq 1$ with the property that for all such
$G$, with high probability the proportion is between $a^-(k)$ and $a^+(k)$, and
we give examples where these extremes are achieved. For many $H$ we have
$a^-(k) = a^+(k)$ for all $k$ and so in these cases we obtain a quite precise
description of the almost sure appearance of a randomly chosen $H$-colouring.
  As a corollary, we show that in a uniform proper $q$-colouring of a regular
bipartite graph, if $q$ is even then with high probability every colour appears
on a proportion close to $1/q$ of the vertices, while if $q$ is odd then with
high probability every colour appears on at least a proportion close to
$1/(q+1)$ of the vertices and at most a proportion close to $1/(q-1)$ of the
vertices.
  Our results generalize to natural models of weighted $H$-colourings, and also
to bipartite graphs which are sufficiently close to regular. As an application
of this latter extension we describe the typical structure of $H$-colourings of
graphs which are obtained from $n$-regular bipartite graphs by percolation, and
we show that $p=1/n$ is a threshold function across which the typical structure
changes.
  The approach is through entropy, and extends work of J. Kahn, who considered
the size of a randomly chosen independent set of a regular bipartite graph.

vertices of $G$ to the vertices of $H$ that preserves adjacency. $H$-colorings
encode graph theory notions such as independent sets and proper colorings, and
are a natural setting for the study of hard-constraint models in statistical
physics.
  We study the set of $H$-colorings of the even discrete torus ${\mathbb
Z}^d_m$, the graph on vertex set ${0, ..., m-1}^d$ ($m$ even) with two strings
adjacent if they differ by 1 (mod $m$) on one coordinate and agree on all
others. This is a bipartite graph, with bipartition classes ${\mathcal E}$ and
${\mathcal O}$. In the case $m=2$ the even discrete torus is the discrete
hypercube or Hamming cube $Q_d$, the usual nearest neighbor graph on ${0,1}^d$.
  We obtain, for any $H$ and fixed $m$, a structural characterization of the
space of $H$-colorings of ${\mathbb Z}^d_m$. We show that it may be partitioned
into an exceptional subset of negligible size (as $d$ grows) and a collection
of subsets indexed by certain pairs $(A,B) \in V(H)^2$, with each $H$-coloring
in the subset indexed by $(A,B)$ having all but a vanishing proportion of
vertices from ${\mathcal E}$ mapped to vertices from $A$, and all but a
vanishing proportion of vertices from ${\mathcal O}$ mapped to vertices from
$B$. This implies a long-range correlation phenomenon for uniformly chosen
$H$-colorings of ${\mathbb Z}^d_m$ with $m$ fixed and $d$ growing.
  Our proof proceeds through an analysis of the entropy of a uniformly chosen
$H$-coloring, and extends an approach of Kahn, who had considered the special
case of $m=2$ and $H$ a doubly infinite path. All our results generalize to a
natural weighted model of $H$-colorings.

Using two archival Chandra observations, we demonstrate that the quiescent
spectrum of this neutron star low-mass X-ray binary is soft and can be fit to a
neutron star atmosphere model with a temperature of kT^inf~73 eV. A powerlaw
spectral component is not required by the data and contributes at most ~20% to
the total unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of ~9E-14 erg/cm2/s. Such a soft quiescent
spectrum is unusual for neutron stars with relatively high inferred magnetic
fields and casts a different light on the interpretation of the hard spectral
component, which is often attributed to magnetic field effects. For a distance
of 5.5 kpc, the estimated quiescent thermal bolometric luminosity is ~6E32
erg/s. If the thermal emission is interpreted as cooling of the neutron star,
the observed luminosity requires that the system is quiescent for at least ~100
years. Alternatively, enhanced neutrino emissions can cool the neutron star to
the observed quiescent luminosity.

at redshift 1.3<z<2.5 identified in the HUDF using HST ACS and WFC3/IR images.
After matching different PSFs, we obtain color maps and multi-band
optical/near-IR photometry (BVizYJH) in concentric annuli, from the smallest
resolved radial (~1.7 kpc) up to several times the H-band effective radius. We
find that the inner regions of these galaxies have redder rest-frame
UV--optical colors than the outer parts. The slopes of the color gradients
mildly depend on the overall dust obscuration and rest-frame (U-V) color, with
more obscured or redder galaxies having steeper color gradients. The z~2 color
gradients are also steeper than those of local early-types. The gradient of a
single parameter (age, extinction or metallicity) cannot fully explain the
observed color gradients. Fitting spatially resolved HST seven-band photometry
to stellar population synthesis models, we find that, regardless of assumptions
for metallicity gradient, the redder inner regions of the galaxies have
slightly higher dust obscuration than the bluer outer regions, although the
magnitude depends on the assumed extinction law. The derived age gradient
depends on the assumptions for metallicity gradient. We discuss the
implications of a number of assumptions for metallicity gradient on the
formation and evolution of these galaxies. We find that the evolution of the
mass--size relationship from z~2 to z~0 cannot be driven by in--situ extended
star formation, implying that accretion or merger is mostly responsible for the
evolution. The lack of a correlation between color gradient and stellar mass
argues against the metallicity gradient predicted by the monolithic collapse,
which would require significant major mergers to evolve into the one observed
at z~0. (Abridged)

(AGN) flux proxies: a mid-infrared (MIR) sample from the original IRAS 12$\mu$m
survey and an optical ([OIII]$\lambda$ 5007 \AA\ flux limited) sample from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), providing a total of 45 Sy2s. As the MIR and
[OIII] fluxes are largely unaffected by AGN obscuration, these samples can
present an unbiased estimate of the Compton-thick (column density N$_H >
10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) subpopulation. We find that the majority of this combined
sample is likely heavily obscured, as evidenced by the 2-10 keV X-ray
attenuation (normalized by intrinsic flux diagnostics) and the large Fe
K$\alpha$ equivalent widths (several hundred eV to over 1 keV). A wide range of
these obscuration diagnostics is present, showing a continuum of column
densities, rather than a clear segregation into Compton-thick and Compton-thin
sub-populations. We find that in several instances, the fitted column densities
severely under-represent the attenuation implied by these obscuration
diagnostics, indicating that simple X-ray models may not always recover the
intrinsic absorption. We compared AGN and host galaxy properties, such as
intrinsic luminosity, central black hole mass, accretion rate, and star
formation rate with obscuration diagnostics. No convincing evidence exists to
link obscured sources with unique host galaxy populations from their less
absorbed counterparts. Finally, we estimate that a majority of these Seyfert 2s

axial strings on nanotubes with high rigidity to stretching. These

evidence of star-formation. The possibility of fragmentation of these shells,
leading to the formation of putative star-forming clumps is examined with the
aid of semi-analytic arguments. We also derive a mass-spectrum for clumps
condensing out of these shells by performing Monte-Carlo simulations of the
problem. By extending on results from our previous work on the stability of
thin, dense shells, we argue that clump-mass estimated by other authors in the
past, under a set of simplifying assumptions, are several orders of magnitude
smaller than those calculated here. Using the expression for the fastest
growing unstable mode in a shock-confined shell, we show that fragmentation of
a typical shell can produce clumps with a typical mass $\gtrsim 10^{3}$
M$_{\odot}$. It is likely that such clumps could spawn a second generation of
massive and/or intermediate-mass stars which could in turn, trigger the next
cycle of star-formation. We suggest that the ratio of shell thickness-to-radius
evolves only weakly with time. Calculations have been performed for stars of
seven spectral types, ranging from B1 to O5. We separately consider the

generalization of Ebina et al. (Prog. Theor. Phys. 104 (2000) 1317), we show

the correction takes a particular form as the inverse square of the impact

concluded that the light curve shape by microlensing is inevitably changed and
will thus allow us to probe modified gravity, unless a modification to the
deflection angle takes the particular form. No systematic deviation in

formation rate and (ii) observational selection effects due to telescope
thresholds and redshift measurements. With a phenomenological investigation on
these two complexities, we constrain and discriminate two popular competitive
LF models (i.e., broke-power-law LF and single-power-law LF with an exponential
cutoff at low luminosities). As a result, we find that the broken-power-law LF
could be more favored by the observation, with a break luminosity

$\sim0.1Z_{\odot}$ as expected by some collapsar models, then there may be no
extra evolution effect other than the metallicity evolution (i.e., $\delta$
approaches to be zero). Alternatively, if we remove the theoretical metallicity
requirement, then a relationship between the degenerate parameters $\delta$ and
$Z_{\max}$ can be found, very roughly,
$\delta\sim2.4(Z_{\max}/Z_{\odot}-0.06)$. This indicates that an extra

recreational mathematics. In a typical hat guessing game, after initially
coordinating a strategy, each of $n$ players is assigned a hat from a given
color set. Simultaneously, each player tries to guess the color of his/her own
hat by looking at colors of hats worn by other players. In this paper, we
consider a new variation of this game, in which we require at least $k$ correct
guesses and no wrong guess for the players to win the game, but they can choose
to ""pass"".
  A strategy is called {\em perfect} if it can achieve the simple upper bound
$\frac{n}{n+k}$ of the winning probability. We present sufficient and necessary
condition on the parameters $n$ and $k$ for the existence of perfect strategy
in the hat guessing games. In fact for any fixed parameter $k$, the existence
of perfect strategy can be determined for every sufficiently large $n$.
  In our construction we introduce a new notion: $(d_1,d_2)$-regular partition
of the boolean hypercube, which is worth to study in its own right. For
example, it is related to the $k$-dominating set of the hypercube. It also
might be interesting in coding theory. The existence of $(d_1,d_2)$-regular

of the two dimensional q-state Potts model. The algorithm is based on a
checkerboard update scheme and assigns independent random numbers generators to
each thread. The implementation allows to simulate systems up to ~10^9 spins
with an average time per spin flip of 0.147ns on the fastest GPU card tested,
representing a speedup up to 155x, compared with an optimized serial code
running on a high-end CPU. The possibility of performing high speed simulations
at large enough system sizes allowed us to provide a positive numerical
evidence about the existence of metastability on very large systems based on
Binder's criterion, namely, on the existence or not of specific heat
singularities at spinodal temperatures different of the transition one.

Lindley's measure, is widely used in various problems such as developing prior
distributions, models for the likelihood functions and optimal designs. The
predictive information is defined similarly and used for model selection and
optimal designs, though to a lesser extent. The parameter and predictive
information measures are proper utility functions and have been also used in
combination. Yet the relationship between the two measures and the effects of
conditional dependence between the observable quantities on the Bayesian
information measures remain unexplored. We address both issues. The
relationship between the two information measures is explored through the
information provided by the sample about the parameter and prediction jointly.
The role of dependence is explored along with the interplay between the
information measures, prior and sampling design. For the conditionally
independent sequence of observable quantities, decompositions of the joint
information characterize Lindley's measure as the sample information about the
parameter and prediction jointly and the predictive information as part of it.
For the conditionally dependent case, the joint information about parameter and
prediction exceeds Lindley's measure by an amount due to the dependence. More
specific results are shown for the normal linear models and a broad subfamily
of the exponential family. Conditionally independent samples provide relatively
little information for prediction, and the gap between the parameter and
predictive information measures grows rapidly with the sample size.

candidates in Upper Sco with AAT/AAOmega. We have estimated the spectral types
and measured the equivalent widths of youth and gravity diagnostic features to
confirm the spectroscopic membership of about 95% of the candidates extracted
from 6.5 square degrees in Upper Sco. We also detect lithium in the spectra
with the highest signal-to-noise, consolidating our conclusions about their
youth. Furthermore, we derive an estimate of our selections using spectroscopic
data obtained for a large number of stars falling into the instrument's
field-of-view. We have estimated the effective temperatures and masses for each
new spectroscopic member using the latest evolutionary models available for
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Combining the current optical spectroscopy
presented here with near-infrared spectroscopy obtained for the faintest
photometric candidates, we confirm the shape and slope of our earlier
photometric mass function. The luminosity function drawn from the spectroscopic
sample of 113 USco members peaks at around M6 and is flat at later spectral
type. We may detect the presence of the M7/M8 gap in the luminosity function as
a result of the dust properties in substellar atmospheres. The mass function
may peak at 0.2 Msun and is quite flat in the substellar regime. We observe a
possible excess of cool low-mass brown dwarfs compared to IC 348 and the
extrapolation of the field mass functions, supporting the original hypothesis
that Upper Sco may possess an excess of brown dwarfs. This result shows that
the selection of photometric candidates based on five band photometry available
from the UKIDSS GCS and complemented partially by proper motions can lead to a
good representation of the spectroscopic mass function (abridged).

Descriptions of particles propagating and interacting in spacetimes are
constructed by observers, but different observers, separated from each other by
translations, construct different spacetime projections from the invariant
phase space. Nonetheless, all observers agree that interactions are local in
the spacetime coordinates constructed by observers local to them.
  This framework, in which absolute locality is replaced by relative locality,
results from deforming momentum space, just as the passage from absolute to
relative simultaneity results from deforming the linear addition of velocities.
Different aspects of momentum space geometry, such as its curvature, torsion
and non-metricity, are reflected in different kinds of deformations of the
energy-momentum conservation laws. These are in principle all measurable by
appropriate experiments. We also discuss a natural set of physical hypotheses

production with extragalactic background light leads to the development of
electromagnetic cascades and subsequent, lower energy, GeV secondary gamma-ray
emission. Due to the deflection of VHE cascade electrons by extragalactic
magnetic fields (EGMF), the spectral shape of this arriving cascade gamma-ray
emission is dependent on the strength of the EGMF. Thus, the spectral shape of
the GeV-TeV emission from blazars has the potential to probe the EGMF strength
along the line of sight to the object. We investigate constraints on the EGMF
derived from observations of blazars for which TeV observations simultaneous
with those by the Fermi telescope were reported. We study the dependence of the
EGMF bound on the hidden assumptions it rests upon. We select blazar objects
for which simultaneous Fermi/LAT GeV and Veritas, MAGIC or HESS TeV emission
have been published. We model the development of electromagnetic cascades along
the gamma-ray beams from these sources using Monte Carlo simulations, including
the calculation of the temporal delay incurred by cascade photons, relative to
the light propagation time of direct gamma-rays from the source. Constraints on
EGMF could be derived from the simultaneous GeV-TeV data on the blazars RGB
J0710+591, 1ES 0229+200, and 1ES 1218+304. The measured source flux level in
the GeV band is lower than the expected cascade component calculated under the
assumption of zero EGMF. Assuming that the reason for the suppression of the
cascade component is the extended nature of the cascade emission, we find that
B>10^{-15} G (assuming EGMF correlation length of ~1 Mpc) is consistent with
the data. Alternatively, the assumption that the suppression of the cascade
emission is caused by the time delay of the cascade photons the data are
consistent with B>10^{-17} G for the same correlation length.

structure and dynamics of the collision fireball. Thermal photons having $K_T
\, \le \, 2$ GeV/$c$ get competing contribution from both hadronic and quark
matter phases and this competition gives rise to a rich structure in the
outward correlation function, owing to the interference between the photons
from the two sources. The temporal separation between the two sources provides
the lifetime of the system and the correlation results are found to be
sensitive to quark hadron phase transition temperature and the formation time
of the plasma. The outward correlation function strongly depends on the
equation of state of the strongly interacting matter and is seen to clearly
distinguish between the lattice based and bag model equations of state.

We performed a detailed analysis of the superoutburst that occurred in August
2009. We found the superhump period to be P_sh=0.057122(14)days. Based on the
O-C diagram we conclude that P_sh increased during the plateau at the rate of
dP_sh/dt=(9.24 +- 1.4) * 10^-5. Both the O-C analysis and evolution of the
superhumps light curve favour the model in which superhumps originate in a
variable source located in the vicinity of the hot spot. In addition, the
evolution of the light curve suggests that the superhump light source
approaches the disc plane as the superoutburst declines. Detailed analysis of
the superoutburst plateau phase enabled us to detect a signal which we
interpret as apsidal motion of the accretion disc. We detected additional
modulations during the final stage of the superoutburst characterized by
periods of 104s and 188s which we tentatively interpret as quasi periodic
oscillations. Estimations of A_0 and A_n are in agreement with the dependence
discovered by Smak (2010) between the amplitude of superhumps and the orbital
inclination.

lonely there and not liking the cold winter weather, I decided around the

the city in which I was born and raised. At that time, Leo Breiman was an

linear diffusion processes and other research as well, since the department
offered me a tenure track Assistant Professorship, which I happily accepted.
During the Summer of 1965, I worked on various projects with Sidney Port, then
at RAND Corporation, especially on random walks and related material. I was
promoted to Associate Professor, effective in Fall, 1966, presumably thanks in
part to Leo. Early in 1966, I~was surprised to be asked by Leo to participate
in a department meeting called to discuss the possible hiring of Sidney. The
conclusion was that Sidney was hired as Associate Professor in the department,
as of Fall, 1966. Leo communicated to me his view that he thought that Sidney
and I worked well together, which is why he had urged the department to hire
Sidney. Anyhow, Sidney and I had a very fruitful and enjoyable collaboration in
probability and, to a much lesser extent, in theoretical statistics, for a
number of years thereafter.

bodies of a few decimeters in size can ""stick"" to form large planetesimals.
This is known as the ""meter size barrier"". In recent years it has become
increasingly clear that some form of ""particle trapping"" must have played a
role in overcoming the meter size barrier. Particles can be trapped in
long-lived local pressure maxima, such as those in anticyclonic vortices, zonal
flows or those believed to occur near ice lines or at dead zone boundaries.
Such pressure traps are the ideal sites for the formation of planetesimals and
small planetary embryos. Moreover, they likely produce large quantities of such
bodies in a small region, making it likely that subsequent N-body evolution may
lead to even larger planetary embryos. The goal of this Letter is to show that
this indeed happens, and to study how efficient it is. In particular, we wish
to find out if rocky/icy bodies as large as 10 M_earth can form within 1 Myr,
since such bodies are the precursors of gas giant planets in the core accretion
scenario.

sequences plays an important role in modern biology. A key component of such
statistical analyses is the computation of $p$-values and confidence bounds for
statistics defined on the genome. Currently such computation is commonly
achieved through ad hoc simulation measures. The method of randomization, which
is at the heart of these simulation procedures, can significantly affect the
resulting statistical conclusions. Most simulation schemes introduce a variety
of hidden assumptions regarding the nature of the randomness in the data,
resulting in a failure to capture biologically meaningful relationships. To
address the need for a method of assessing the significance of observations
within large scale genomic studies, where there often exists a complex
dependency structure between observations, we propose a unified solution built
upon a data subsampling approach. We propose a piecewise stationary model for
genome sequences and show that the subsampling approach gives correct answers

apply to each predictor coefficient separately; Euclidean penalties group the

confronted with the interference of stellar noise. HARPS can now reach a
precision below the meter-per-second, which corresponds to the amplitudes of
different stellar perturbations, such as oscillation, granulation, and
activity. Solar spot groups induced by activity produce a radial-velocity noise
of a few meter-per-second. The aim of this paper is to simulate this activity
and calculate detection limits according to different observational strategies.
Based on Sun observations, we reproduce the evolution of spot groups on the
surface of a rotating star. We then calculate the radial-velocity effect
induced by these spot groups as a function of time. Taking into account
oscillation, granulation, activity, and a HARPS instrumental error of 80 cm/s,
we simulate the effect of different observational strategies in order to
efficiently reduce all sources of noise. Applying three measurements per night
of 10 minutes every three days, 10 nights a month seems the best tested
strategy. Depending on the level of activity considered, from log(R'_HK)= -5 to
-4.75, this strategy would allow us to find planets of 2.5 to 3.5 Earth masses
in the habitable zone of a K1V dwarf. Using Bern's model of planetary
formation, we estimate that for the same range of activity level, 15 to 35 % of
the planets between 1 and 5 Earth masses and with a period between 100 and 200
days should be found with HARPS. A comparison between the performance of HARPS
and ESPRESSO is also emphasized by our simulations. Using the same optimized
strategy, ESPRESSO could find 1.3 Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of
early-K dwarfs. In addition, 80 % of planets with mass between 1 and 5 Earth

Bethe-ansatz based density-functional theory and density-matrix renormalization
method. The ground-state properties of this model are discussed in details for
different fillings and different confining conditions in weak-to-intermediate
coupling regime. We investigate the ground-state energy, energy gap, and
pair-binding energy and compare them with those calculated from the canonical
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation. We find that the Bethe-ansatz based
density-functional theory is computationally easy and yields an accurate
description of the ground-state properties for weak-to-intermediate interaction
strength, different fillings, and confinements. In order to characterize the
quantum phase transition in the presence of a harmonic confinement, we
calculate the thermodynamic stiffness, the density-functional fidelity, and
fidelity susceptibility, respectively. It is shown that with the increase of
the number of particles or attractive interaction strength, the system can be
driven from the Luther-Emery-type phase to the composite phase of
Luther-Emery-like in the wings and insulating-like in the center.

two-phase (gas-liquid) hydrocarbon fluids, considering non equilibrium between
phases. Two phases may be present either already at the beginning of the
blowdown process (for instance in gas-liquid separators) or as the liquid is
formed from flashing of the vapor due to the cooling induced by pressure
decrease. There is experimental evidence that the assumption of thermodynamic
equilibrium is not appropriate, since the two phases show an independent
temperature evolution. Thus, due to the greater heat transfer between the
liquid phase with the wall, the wall in contact with the liquid experiences a
stronger cooling than the wall in contact with the gas, during the blowdown. As
a consequence, the vessel should be designed for a lower temperature than if it
was supposed to contain vapor only. Our model is based on a compositional
approach, and it takes into account internal heat and mass transfer processes,
as well as heat transfer with the vessel wall and the external environment.
Numerical simulations show a generally good agreement with experimental
measurements.

performed as a relative-difference ((S/W)di) from a working-lab-reference (W),
but the result is evaluated relative to a recommended-standard (D): (S/D)di. It
is thus assumed that different source specific results ((S1/D)di, (S2/D)di)
would represent their sources (S1, S2), and be accurately intercomparable.
However, the assumption has never been checked. In this manuscript we carry out
this task by considering a system as CO2+-IRMS. We present a model for a priori
predicting output-uncertainty. Our study shows that scale-conversion, even with
the aid of auxiliary-reference-standard(s) Ai(s), cannot make (S/D)di free from
W; and the ((S/W)di,(A1/W)di,(A2/W)di) To (S/D)di conversion-formula normally
used in the literature is invalid. Besides, the latter-relation has been worked
out, which leads to e.g.,
fJ([(S/W)dJCO2pmp%],[(A1/W)dJCO2pmp%],[(A2/W)dJCO2pmp%]) = ((S/D)dJCO2pm4.5p%);
whereas FJ([(S/W)dJCO2pmp%],[(A1/W)dJCO2pmp%]) = ((S/D)dJCO2pm1.2p%). That is,
contrary to the general belief (Nature 1978, 271, 534), the scale-conversion by
employing one than two Ai-standards should ensure (S/D)di to be more accurate.
However, a more valuable finding is that the transformation of any d-estimate
into its absolute value helps improve accuracy, or any reverse-process enhances
uncertainty. Thus, equally accurate though the absolute-estimates of
isotopic-CO2 and constituent-elemental-isotopic abundance-ratios could be, in
contradistinction any differential-estimate is shown to be less accurate.
Further, for S and D to be similar, any absolute estimate is shown to turn out
nearly absolute accurate but any (S/D)d value as really absurd. That is,
estimated source specific absolute values, rather than corresponding
differential results, should really represent their sources, and/ or be closely
intercomparable.

show a slow two-step emergence waiting longer the secondary instability to be
triggered. This picture of the two-step emergence is highly consistent with
recent observations. These tubes show multiple magnetic domes above the
surface, indicating that the secondary emergence is caused by interchange mode
of magnetic buoyancy instability. As for the weakest twist case, the tube
exhibits an elongated photospheric structure and never rises into the corona.
The formation of the photospheric structure is due to inward magnetic tension
force of the azimuthal field component of the rising flux tube (i.e., tube's
twist). When the twist is weak, azimuthal field cannot hold the tube's
coherency, and the tube extends laterally at the subadiabatic surface. In
addition, we newly find that the total magnetic energy measured above the
surface depends on the initial twist. Strong twist tubes follow the initial
relation between the twist and the magnetic energy, while weak twist tubes
deviates from this relation, because these tubes store their magnetic energy in
the photospheric structures.

Modern high precision physics experiments now exceed the achievable numerical

are optical resonators for which changes in the optical length are now commonly
measured to 10^{-15} precision. The achievable measurement accuracy for
resonators and cavities is directly influenced by changes in the distances
between the optical components. If deformations in the range of 10^{-15} occur,
those effects cannot be modeled and analysed any more with standard methods
based on double precision data types. New experimental approaches point out
that the achievable experimental accuracies may improve down to the level of
10^{-17} in the near future. For the development and improvement of high
precision resonators and the analysis of experimental data, new methods have to
be developed which enable the needed level of simulation accuracy. Therefore we

multifractal statistics only at criticality, the tree geometry induces
multifractal statistics for disordered systems also off criticality. For the
Anderson tight-binding localization model defined on a tree of branching ratio
K=2 with $N$ generations, we consider the Miller-Derrida scattering geometry
[J. Stat. Phys. 75, 357 (1994)], where an incoming wire is attached to the root
of the tree, and where $K^{N}$ outcoming wires are attached to the leaves of
the tree. In terms of the $K^{N}$ transmission amplitudes $t_j$, the total
Landauer transmission is $T \equiv \sum_j | t_j |^2$, so that each channel $j$
is characterized by the weight $w_j=| t_j |^2/T$. We numerically measure the
typical multifractal singularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$ of these weights as a
function of the disorder strength $W$ and we obtain the following conclusions
for its left-termination point $\alpha_+(W)$. In the delocalized phase $W<W_c$,
$\alpha_+(W)$ is strictly positive $\alpha_+(W)>0$ and is associated with a
moment index $q_+(W)>1$. At criticality, it vanishes $\alpha_+(W_c)=0$ and is
associated with the moment index $q_+(W_c)=1$. In the localized phase $W>W_c$,
$\alpha_+(W)=0$ is associated with some moment index $q_+(W)<1$. We discuss the

necessary part of some areas of quantitative inference, including in United
States voting rights litigation. Ecological inference suffers from a lack of
identification that, most agree, is best addressed by incorporating
individual-level data into the model. In this paper we test the limits of such
an incorporation by attempting it in the context of drawing inferences about
racial voting patterns using a combination of an exit poll and precinct-level
ecological data; accurate information about racial voting patterns is needed to
assess triggers in voting rights laws that can determine the composition of
United States legislative bodies. Specifically, we extend and study a hybrid
model that addresses two-way tables of arbitrary dimension. We apply the hybrid
model to an exit poll we administered in the City of Boston in 2008. Using the
resulting data as well as simulation, we compare the performance of a pure
ecological estimator, pure survey estimators using various sampling schemes and
our hybrid. We conclude that the hybrid estimator offers substantial benefits
by enabling substantive inferences about voting patterns not practicably
available without its use.

constants of nature are functions of cosmological time. White dwarfs offer the
possibility of testing a possible variation of G and, thus, to place
constraints to these theories. We present full white dwarf evolutionary
calculations in the case that G decreases with time. White dwarf evolution is
computed in a self-consistent way, including the most up-to-date physical
inputs, non-gray model atmospheres and a detailed core chemical composition
that results from the calculation of the full evolution of progenitor stars. We
find that the mechanical structure and the energy balance of white dwarfs are
strongly modified by the presence of a varying G. In particular, for certain
values of the rate of change of G, the evolution of cool white dwarfs is
markedly affected. The impact of a varying G is more notorious in the case of
more massive white dwarfs. In view of the recent results reporting that a very
accurate white dwarf cooling age can be derived for the old and metal-rich open
cluster NGC 6791, our study suggests that this cluster could be a potential
target to constrain or detect a ypothetical secular variation of G.

exponential family. Notorious members are the Bernoulli model for binary data,
leading to logistic regression, and the Poisson model for count data, leading
to Poisson regression. Two of the main reasons for extending this family are
(1) the occurrence of overdispersion, meaning that the variability in the data
is not adequately described by the models, which often exhibit a prescribed
mean--variance link, and (2) the accommodation of hierarchical structure in the
data, stemming from clustering in the data which, in turn, may result from
repeatedly measuring the outcome, for various members of the same family, etc.
The first issue is dealt with through a variety of overdispersion models, such
as, for example, the beta-binomial model for grouped binary data and the
negative-binomial model for counts. Clustering is often accommodated through
the inclusion of random subject-specific effects. Though not always, one
conventionally assumes such random effects to be normally distributed. While
both of these phenomena may occur simultaneously, models combining them are
uncommon. This paper proposes a broad class of generalized linear models
accommodating overdispersion and clustering through two separate sets of random
effects. We place particular emphasis on so-called conjugate random effects at
the level of the mean for the first aspect and normal random effects embedded
within the linear predictor for the second aspect, even though our family is
more general. The binary, count and time-to-event cases are given particular
emphasis. Apart from model formulation, we present an overview of estimation
methods, and then settle for maximum likelihood estimation with
analytic--numerical integration. Implications for the derivation of marginal
correlations functions are discussed. The methodology is applied to data from a
study in epileptic seizures, a clinical trial in toenail infection named
onychomycosis and survival data in children with asthma.

constraints is needed. As the conventional constraints for extrasolar planets
like mass, radius, and temperature allow for a large number of acceptable
models, a new planetary parameter is desirable in order to further constrain
planetary models. Such a parameter may be the tidal Love number k2. In this
paper we aim to study the capability of k2 to reveal further information about
the interior structure of a planet. With theoretical planetary models we
investigate how the tidal Love number k2 responds to the internal density
distribution of a planet. In particular, we demonstrate the effect of the
degeneracy of k2 due to a density discontinuity in the envelope of a
three-layer planetary model. The effect of a possible outer density
discontinuity masks the effect of the core mass on the Love number k2. Hence,
there is no unique relationship between the Love number k2 and the core mass of
a planet. We show that the degeneracy of k2 with respect to a layer boundary in
the envelope also occurs in existing planets, e.g. Saturn and the Hot Neptune
GJ436b. As a result of the degeneracy, the planetary parameter k2 cannot be
used to further constrain Saturnian models and for GJ436b only a maximum
possible core mass can be derived from a given k2. To significantly narrow the
uncertainty about the core mass of GJ436b the combined knowledge of k2 and
atmospheric metallicity and temperature profile is necessary.

in galaxy clusters. Measuring these populations is difficult, but important for
understanding the assembly of the most massive galaxies. The Coma cluster is
one of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a
correspondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from
the HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a
large population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core
and is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile
around the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large
radii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).
We estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs
out to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making
this the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC
systems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the
cluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster
light (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If
the IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,
then the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.
The ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of
the stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of
the IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,
metal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1. The fraction of red IGCs (20%), and the red
color of those GCs, implies that IGCs can originate from the halos of
relatively massive, L* galaxies, and not solely from the disruption of dwarf
galaxies. (Abridged)

trapped in a self-generated Langmuir wave and embedded in an infinitely long
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating through a plasma. From
the mathematical point of view they are exact solutions of the 1-dimensional
relativistic cold fluid plasma model with nonvanishing boundary conditions.
Under the assumption of traveling wave solutions with velocity $V$ and vector
potential frequency $\omega$, the fluid model is reduced to a Hamiltonian
system. The solitary waves are homoclinic (grey solitons) or heteroclinic (dark
solitons) orbits to fixed points. By using a dynamical systems description of
the Hamiltonian system and a spectral method, we identify a great variety of
solitary waves, including asymmetric ones, discuss their disappearance for
certain parameter values, and classify them according to: (i) grey or dark
character, (ii) the number of humps of the vector potential envelope and (iii)
their symmetries. The solutions come in continuous families in the parametric
$V-\omega$ plane and extend up to velocities that approach the speed of light.
The stability of certain types of grey solitary waves is investigated with the
aid of particle-in-cell simulations that demonstrate their propagation for a
few tens of the inverse of the plasma frequency.

evolution equation both from mathematical and physical points of view. It is
related to the dynamics of several important physical systems such as
ferromagnets, vortex filaments, moving space curves, etc. and has intimate
connections with many of the well known integrable soliton equations, including
nonlinear Schr\""odinger and sine-Gordon equations. It can admit very many
dynamical structures including spin waves, elliptic function waves, solitons,
dromions, vortices, spatio-temporal patterns, chaos, etc. depending on the
physical and spin dimensions and the nature of interactions. An exciting recent
development is that the spin torque effect in nanoferromagnets is described by
a generalization of the LLG equation which forms a basic dynamical equation in
the field of spintronics. This article will briefly review these developments
as a tribute to Robin Bullough who was a great admirer of the LLG equation.

particles occupy a single spatial mode, this quantum many body system has a
well defined classical limit consisting of three degrees of freedom,
corresponding to the three macroscopically occupied spin states. We study both
the classical limit and its quantization, finding an integrable system in both
cases. Depending on the sign of the ratio of the spin interaction energy and
the quadratic Zeeman energy, the classical limit displays either a separartrix
in phase space, or Hamiltonian monodromy corresponding to non-trivial phase
space topology. We discuss the quantum signatures of these classical phenomena
using semiclassical quantization as well as an exact solution using the Bethe

which introduces phases in the expressions of their helicity amplitudes.
Several Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) distribution and fragmentation
functions appear and contribute to the cross sections and to spin asymmetries.
Our results agree with those obtained with different formalisms, showing the
consistency of our approach. The full expression for single and double spin
asymmetries is derived. Simplified, explicit analytical expressions, convenient
for phenomenological studies, are obtained assuming a factorized Gaussian

they synthesize those molecules that maximize their fitness. As a result, the
relative concentrations of related chemical monomers in life-bearing
environmental samples reflect, in part, those compounds' adaptive utility. In
contrast, rates of molecular synthesis in a lifeless environment are dictated
by reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, so concentrations of related monomers
in abiotic samples tend to exhibit specific patterns dominated by small, easily
formed, low-formation-energy molecules. We contend that this distinction can
serve as a universal biosignature: the measurement of chemical concentration
ratios that belie formation kinetics or equilibrium thermodynamics indicates
the likely presence of life. We explore the features of this biosignature as
observed in amino acids and carboxylic acids, using published data from
numerous studies of terrestrial sediments, abiotic (spark, UV, and high-energy
proton) synthesis experments, and meteorite bodies. We then compare these data
to the results of experimental studies of an evolving digital life system. We
observe the robust and repeatable evolution of an analogous biosignature in a
digital lifeform, suggesting that evolutionary selection necessarily constrains
organism composition and that the monomer abundance biosignature phenomenon is
universal to evolved biosystems.
