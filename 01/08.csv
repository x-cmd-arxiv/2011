doi:10.1371/ journal.pone.0009621) ant motion out of the nest is shown to be a
non-stationary process intriguingly similar to the dynamics encountered in
\emph{physical aging} of glassy systems. Specifically, exit events can be
described as a Poisson process in logarithmic time, or, for short, a
log-Poisson process. Nouvellet et al.(J. Theor. Biol. 266, 573. (2010))
criticized these conclusions and performed new experiments where the exit
process could more simply be described by standard Poisson statistics. In their
reply, (J Theor. Biol. 269, 356-358 (2011)) Richardson et al. stressed that the
two sets of experiments were performed under very different conditions and
claimed that this was the likely source of the discrepancy. The focal point of
this work is whether log-Poisson and Poisson statistics both are possible under
different external conditions. To this end, a model is introduced where
interacting ants move in a stochastic fashion from one site to a neighboring
site on a finite 2D lattice. The probability of each move is determined by the
ensuing changes of a utility function which is a sum of pairwise interactions
between ants, weighted by distance. Depending on how the interactions are
defined and on a control parameter dubbed 'degree of stochasticity' (DS), the
dynamics either quickly converges to a stationary state, where movements are a
standard Poisson process, or may enter a non-stationary regime, where exits can
be described as suggested by Richardson et al.

range of structures when the two species individually form aggregates of
different curvatures. A specific example of this is seen in solutions of lipid
mixtures where the two species form lamellar structures and spherical micelles
respectively. Here, vesicles connected by thread-like micelles can form in a
narrow concentration range of the sphere-forming lipid. We present a
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) study of these structures. Firstly, we show
that the addition of sphere-forming lipid to a solution of lamella-former can
lower the free energy of cylindrical, thread-like micelles and hence encourage
their formation. Next, we demonstrate the coupling between composition and
curvature; specifically, that increasing the concentration of sphere-former in
a system of two bilayers connected by a thread leads to a transfer of
amphiphile to the thread. We further show that the two species are segregated
within the structure, with the concentration of sphere-former being
significantly higher in the thread. Finally, the addition of larger amounts of
sphere-former is found to destabilize the junctions linking the bilayers to the
cylindrical micelle, leading to a breakdown of the connected structures. The
degree of segregation of the amphiphiles and the amount of sphere-former
required to destabilize the junctions is shown to be sensitive to the length of

subset of a large number of users asynchronously reporting activity to a base
station. This paper examines the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) in random
access channels for such applications. Traditional orthogonal signaling ignores
the random nature of user activity in this problem and limits the total number
of users to be on the order of the number of signal space dimensions.
Contention-based schemes, on the other hand, suffer from delays caused by
colliding transmissions and the hidden node problem. In contrast, this paper
presents a novel pairing of an asynchronous non-orthogonal code-division random
access scheme with a convex optimization-based MUD algorithm that overcomes the
issues associated with orthogonal signaling and contention-based methods. Two
key distinguishing features of the proposed MUD algorithm are that it does not
require knowledge of the delay or channel state information of every user and
it has polynomial-time computational complexity. The main analytical
contribution of this paper is the relationship between the performance of the
proposed MUD algorithm in the presence of arbitrary or random delays and two
simple metrics of the set of user codewords. The study of these metrics is then
focused on two specific sets of codewords, random binary codewords and
specially constructed algebraic codewords, for asynchronous random access. The
ensuing analysis confirms that the proposed scheme together with either of
these two codeword sets significantly outperforms the orthogonal
signaling-based random access in terms of the total number of users in the
system.

Similar large-scale grouping is not evident among stars with ages 100 Myr.
These stars are also distributed over a much larger area than those with
younger ages, and it is argued that random stellar motions alone, as opposed to
orderly motions of the type spurred by large scale secular effects, can
re-distribute stars out to distances of at least 2 kpc (i.e. one disk scale
length) from their birth places on 100 Myr timescales. Such random motions may
thus play a significant role in populating the outer regions of the M33 disk.
Finally, it is suggested that - to the extent that the ambient properties of
the outer disk mirror those in the main body of the disk - stars in this part
of M33 may have formed in star clusters with masses 50 - 250 solar, which is
substantially lower than the peak of the solar neighborhood initial cluster

present a simple model for estimating the conditions at shock breakout in a
wind based on the general observable quantities in the X-ray flash lightcurve:
the total energy E_X, and the diffusion time after the peak, t_diff. We base
the derivation on the self-similar solution for the forward-reverse shock

extended to constrain the combination of explosion energy and ejecta mass. For

space with CLOUDY, which indicates a large increase in radiation temperature
with height. Illustrative examples of physical models using a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code show that the rising neon ratio may be explained by
adding a vertically extended, hot stellar source to a thin disk of massive
stars. However, several other sources of hard spectra may be relevant. PAH
features have scale heights of 430--530 pc in NGC 891 and 720--1080 pc in NGC
5775, suggesting they can be transported by disk-halo flows. Within NGC 891 and

heights exceed that of 8 micron emission, indicating a transition from more
ionized to more neutral PAHs with height. Most PAH equivalent widths are higher

the expansion of the gravitational potential between two spherical bodies of
any mass ratio. To accurately reproduce the tidal evolution of a system at
separations less than five times the radius of the larger primary component,
the tidal potential due to the presence of a smaller secondary component is
expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials to arbitrary order rather than
truncated at leading order as is typically done in studies of well-separated
system like the Earth and Moon. The equations of tidal evolution including
tidal torques, the changes in spin rates of the components, and the change in
semimajor axis (orbital separation) are then derived for binary asteroid
systems with circular and equatorial mutual orbits. Accounting for higher-order
terms in the tidal potential serves to speed up the tidal evolution of the
system leading to underestimates in the time rates of change of the spin rates,
semimajor axis, and mean motion in the mutual orbit if such corrections are
ignored. Special attention is given to the effect of close orbits on the
calculation of material properties of the components, in terms of the rigidity
and tidal dissipation function, based on the tidal evolution of the system. It
is found that accurate determinations of the physical parameters of the system,
e.g., densities, sizes, and current separation, are typically more important
than accounting for higher-order terms in the potential when calculating
material properties. In the scope of the long-term tidal evolution of the
semimajor axis and the component spin rates, correcting for close orbits is a
small effect, but for an instantaneous rate of change in spin rate, semimajor
axis, or mean motion, the close-orbit correction can be on the order of tens of
percent.

light curves that occurs in a sizeable number of RR Lyrae stars. The physical
origin of the effect has been a puzzle ever since its discovery over a hundred
years ago. We build here upon the recent observational and theoretical work of
Szabo et al. on RRab stars who found with hydrodynamical simulations that the
fundamental pulsation mode can get destabilized by a 9:2 resonant interaction
with the 9th overtone. Alternating pulsation cycles arise, although these
remain periodic, i.e. not modulated as in the observations.
  Here we use the amplitude equation formalism to study this nonlinear,
resonant interaction between the two modes. We show that not only does the
fundamental pulsation mode break up into a period two cycle through the
nonlinear, resonant interaction with the overtone, but that the amplitudes are
modulated, and that in a broad range of parameters the modulations are
irregular as in the observations. This irregular behavior is in fact chaotic
and arises from a strange attractor in the dynamics.

and find a lack of even moderately extinguished events (AV ~ 0.3) above z > 4.
In spite of the biased selection and small number statistics, this result hints
at a decrease in dust content in star-forming environments at high redshifts.

outflows. The data obtained in this study are used in conjunction with Spitzer,
AKARI, and IRAS data. A parsec-scale bipolar outflow is discovered in our H_2
line image, which is supported by the detection in the archival Spitzer images.
The H_2 image exhibits signs of precession of the main jet and shows tentative
evidence for a second outflow. These suggest the possibility of a companion to
the outflow source. There is a strong component of continuum emission in the
direction of the outflow, which supports the idea that the outflow cavity
provides a path for radiation to escape, thereby reducing the radiation
pressure on the accreted matter. The bulk of the emission observed close to the
outflow in the WFCAM and Spitzer bands is rotated counter clockwise with
respect to the outflow traced in H_2, which may be due to precession. The YSO
driving the outflow is identified in the Spitzer images. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the YSO is studied using available radiative transfer
models. A model fit to the SED of the central source tells us that the YSO has
a mass of 12.23 M_sun and that it is in an early stage of evolution.

by Jacques et al. (2007 Science 315, 966), which represents a realization of
Wheeler's delayed-choice Gedankenexperiment. Our analysis is based on the
evolution of the photon state, since the photon enters into the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer with a removable beam-splitter until it exits. Given the same
incident photon state onto the output beam-splitter, BS_output, the photon's
state at the exit will be very different depending on whether BS_output is on
or off. Hence, the statistics of photon counts collected by the two detectors,
positioned along orthogonal directions at the exit of the interferometer, is
also going to be very different in either case. Therefore, it is not that the
choice of inserting (on) or removing (off) a beam-splitter leads to a delayed
influence on the photon behavior before arriving at the beam-splitter, but that
such a choice influences the photon state at and after BS_output, i.e., after
it has exited from the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The random on/off choice at
BS_output has no delayed effect on the photon to behave as a wave or a
corpuscle at the entrance and inside the interferometer, but influences the
subsequent evolution of the photon state incident onto BS_output.

of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) created by the colliding winds from the pulsar

extended emission apparently consists of two components. The highly significant
compact component looks like a southward extension of the pointlike source
image, seen up to about 4 arcsec from the pulsar position. Its spectrum has
about the same slope as the pointlike source spectrum, while its luminosity is
a factor of 10 lower. We also detected an elongated feature extended ~15 arcsec

wind blown out of the binary by the wind of the Be component, while the

non-linear cosmological structure formation. A novel approach is used to
numerically calculate the three-dimensional dark matter density field using SPT
from the initial conditions of two high-resolution cosmological simulations.
The calculated density field is compared to the non-linear dark matter field of
the simulations both point-by-point and statistically. For smoothing scales
above 8 Mpc/h it shows a good agreement up to redshift 0. We present a simple
fitting formula to relate the linear and non-linear density contrast that
accurately recovers the non-linear time evolution for 0 <= z <= 10 at the per
cent level. To address the problem of biasing between the matter field and the
haloes identified in the simulation, we employ the Eulerian local bias model
(ELB), including non-linear bias up to the third order. The bias parameters are
obtained by fitting a scatter plot of halo and matter density (both from the
simulation and from SPT). Using these bias parameters, we can reconstruct the
halo density field. We find that this reconstruction is not able to capture all
the details of the halo distribution. We investigate how well the large scale
bias can be described by a constant and if it corresponds to the linear bias
parameter b_1 of the local bias model. We also discuss how well the halo-halo
power spectrum and the halo-mass cross spectrum from the reconstructed halo
density field agree with the corresponding statistics from the simulation. The
results show that while SPT is an excellent approximation for the matter field
for suitably large smoothing scales even at redshift 0, the ELB model can only
account for some of the properties of the halo density field.

analyze N-body simulations in which a BAO-like gaussian bump modulates the
linear theory correlation function \xi_L(r)=(r_0/r)^{n+3} of an underlying
self-similar model with initial power spectrum P(k)=A k^n. These simulations
test physical and analytic descriptions of BAO evolution far beyond the range
of most studies, since we consider a range of underlying power spectra (n=-0.5,
-1, -1.5) and evolve simulations to large effective correlation amplitudes
(equivalent to \sigma_8=4-12 for r_bao = 100 Mpc/h). In all cases, non-linear
evolution flattens and broadens the BAO bump in \xi(r) while approximately
preserving its area. This evolution resembles a ""diffusion"" process in which
the bump width \sigma_bao is the quadrature sum of the linear theory width and
a length proportional to the rms relative displacement \Sigma_pair(r_bao}) of
particle pairs separated by r_bao. For n=-0.5 and n=-1, we find no detectable
shift of the location of the BAO peak, but the peak in the n=-1.5 model shifts
steadily to smaller scales, following r_peak}/r_bao = 1-1.08(r_0/r_bao)^{1.5}.
The ""SimpleRG"" perturbation theory scheme and, to a lesser extent, standard
1-loop perturbation theory are fairly successful at explaining the non-linear
evolution of the fourier power spectrum of our models. Analytic models also
explain why the \xi(r) peak shifts much more for n=-1.5 than for n >= -1,
though no ab initio model we have examined reproduces all of our numerical
results. Simulations with L_box = 10 r_bao} and L_box = 20 r_bao yield
consistent results for \xi(r) at the BAO scale, provided one corrects for the
integral constraint imposed by the uniform density box.

These scattering operators allow one to reformulate the nonequilibrium problem

this paper we provide a pedagogical analysis of the core concepts of the
effective equilibrium theory. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between
observables computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh framework and the effective
equilibrium approach, and relate the Green's functions in the two theoretical
frameworks. Second, we expound some applications of this method in the context
of interacting quantum impurity models. We introduce a novel framework to treat
effects of interactions perturbatively while capturing the entire dependence on
the bias voltage. For the sake of concreteness, we employ the Anderson model as
a prototype for this scheme. Working at the particle-hole symmetric point, we
investigate the fate of the Abrikosov-Suhl resonance as a function of bias

in a state-space model with observation process y, state process x and fixed
parameter theta. An idealized approach would be to apply the iterated batch
importance sampling (IBIS) algorithm of Chopin (2002). This is a sequential
Monte Carlo algorithm in the theta-dimension, that samples values of theta,
reweights iteratively these values using the likelihood increments
p(y_t|y_1:t-1, theta), and rejuvenates the theta-particles through a resampling
step and a MCMC update step. In state-space models these likelihood increments
are intractable in most cases, but they may be unbiasedly estimated by a
particle filter in the x-dimension, for any fixed theta. This motivates the
SMC^2 algorithm proposed in this article: a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm,
defined in the theta-dimension, which propagates and resamples many particle
filters in the x-dimension. The filters in the x-dimension are an example of
the random weight particle filter as in Fearnhead et al. (2010). On the other
hand, the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) framework developed in
Andrieu et al. (2010) allows us to design appropriate MCMC rejuvenation steps.
Thus, the theta-particles target the correct posterior distribution at each
iteration t, despite the intractability of the likelihood increments. We
explore the applicability of our algorithm in both sequential and
non-sequential applications and consider various degrees of freedom, as for
example increasing dynamically the number of x-particles. We contrast our
approach to various competing methods, both conceptually and empirically
through a detailed simulation study, included here and in a supplement, and
based on particularly challenging examples.

SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide regular public releases of all its data,
beginning with SDSS DR8 (which occurred in Jan 2011). This paper presents an
overview of the four SDSS-III surveys. BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.5
million massive galaxies and Lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the
BAO feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of
the distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z<0.7 and at z~2.5. SEGUE-2,
which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (R=1800) optical spectra of
118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution,
stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter
halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE will obtain
high-resolution (R~30,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N>100 per resolution
element), H-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars,
measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the first
high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge,
bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral
diagnostics. MARVELS will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 FGK stars
with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed to
detect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedented
data set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giant
planet systems. (Abridged)

(~< 10 pc) global (~ 20 kpc) simulations of isolated Milky Way-type galaxy
disks. The clouds are formed through gravitational fragmentation and structures
with densities n_H>=100cm^-3 are identified as GMCs. Between 1000-1500 clouds
are created in the simulations with masses M > 10^5 Msolar and 180-240 with
masses M > 10^6 Msolar in agreement with estimates of the Milky Way's
population. We find that the effect of photoelectric heating is to suppress the
fragmentation of the ISM, resulting in a filamentary structure in the warm gas
surrounding clouds. This environment suppresses the formation of a retrograde
rotating cloud population, with 88% of the clouds rotating prograde with
respect to the galaxy after 300 Myr. The diffuse heating also reduces the
initial star formation rate, slowing the conversation of gas into stars. We
therefore conclude that the interstellar environment plays an important role in
the GMCs evolution. Our clouds live between 0-20 Myr with a high infant
mortality (t' < 3 Myr) due to cloud mergers and star formation. Other
properties, including distributions of mass, size and surface density agree
well with observations. Collisions between our clouds are common, occurring at
a rate of ~1/4 of the orbital period. It is not clear whether such collisions
trigger or suppress star formation at our current resolution. Our star
formation rate is a factor of 10 higher than observations in local galaxies.
This is likely due to the absence of localized feedback in our models.

focusing particularly on the close link between these binary components and the
overall secular evolution of CVs. I begin with a brief overview of the
""standard model"" of CV evolution and explain why the key observables this model
is designed to explain - the period gap and the period minimum -- are
intimately connected to the properties of the secondary stars in these systems.
CV donors are expected to be slightly inflated relative to isolated, equal-mass
main-sequence (MS) stars, and this ""donor bloating"" has now been confirmed
observationally. The empirical donor mass-radius relationship also shows a
discontinuity at M_2 = 0.2 M_sun which neatly separates long- and short-period
CVs. This is strong confirmation of the basic disrupted magnetic braking
scenario for CV evolution. The empirical M_2-R_2 relation can be combined with
stellar models to construct a complete, semi-empirical donor sequence for CVs.
This sequence provides all physical and photometric properties of ""normal"" CV
secondaries along the standard CV evolution track. The observed donor
properties can also be used to reconstruct the complete evolution track
followed by CVs, i.e. the mass-transfer rate and angular-momentum-loss rate as
a function of orbital period. Such a reconstruction suggests that angular
momentum loss rates below the period gap are too high to be driven solely by
gravitational radiation.

orientation of the domain boundaries and stabilizing or destabilizing effect of
inhomogeneous elastic strains on the single domain state. We apply the general
results to perovskite systems like BaTiO3/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 films and find that at
least not far from the ferroelectric phase transition the equilibrium domain
structure consists of the stripes along the cubic axes or at 45 degrees to
them. We have also showed that in this system the inhomogeneous strains
increase stability with regards to the small fluctuations of the metastable
single domain state, which may exist not very close to the ferroelectric
transition. The latter analytical result is in qualitative agreement with the
numerical result by Pertsev and Kohlstedt [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 257603 (2007)],

found also that under certain conditions on the material constants, which are
not satisfied in the perovskites but are not forbidden either, a checkerboard
domain structure can be realized instead of the stripe-like one and that the
polarization-strain coupling decreases stability of a single domain state
instead of increasing it. The single domain state is metastable at certain
large thicknesses and becomes suitable for memory applications at even larger
thicknesses when the lifetime of the metastable state becomes sufficiently

combinations of the initial mass function (IMF), the mass of the galaxy, dust
production efficiencies, and the degree of dust destruction in the ISM. We
investigate the influence of the SFR on the evolution of these quantities, and
determine the earliest epochs at which agreement with observations can be

includes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the Southern Galactic Cap,
bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over a
third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with
an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric
recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data
from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and
Evolution (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars
at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million
stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed
through an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determination

correlation functions of our sample galaxies show clear evolution and they
connect to that in the local universe consistently. Also, the massive galaxies
show strong clustering throughout our studied redshift range. The correlation
length of massive galaxies rapidly decreases from z=4 to 2. We also find some
high mass density regions of massive galaxies at 1.4<z<2.5 in our sample, which
may be candidate progenitors of the present-day clusters of galaxies. At this

Based on aperture photometry, we obtain its spectral-energy distribution (SED)

reddened cluster known in M31. Images of deep observations and of highly
spatial resolutions with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the {\sl HST}

the F606W and F814W filters obtained in this paper provide that, colors of
($\rm {F606W-F814W}$) in the dust lane are redder $\sim 0.4$ mags than ones in
the other regions of B037. The {\sl HST} images show that, this dust lane seems
to be contained in B037, not from the M31 disk or the Milky Way. As we know,
the formation of dust requires gas with a rather high metallicity. However,
B037 has a low metallicity to be $\rm [Fe/H]=-1.07\pm 0.20$. So, it seems
improbable that the observed dust lane is physically associated with B037. It
is clear that the origin of this dust lane is worthy of future study. In
addition, based on these images, we present the precise variation of
ellipticity and position angle, and of surface brightness profile, and
determine the structural parameters of B037 by fitting a single-mass isotropic
King model. In the F606W filter, we derive the best-fitting scale radius,

evolution. Yet the conditions in which they form and collapse are still not
fully understood. In particular, the influence of the magnetic field on the
collapse of massive clumps is relatively unexplored, it is thus of great
relevance in the context of the formation of massive stars to investigate its
impact. We perform high resolution, MHD simulations of the collapse of hundred
solar masses, turbulent and magnetized clouds, using the adaptive mesh
refinement code RAMSES. We compute various quantities such as mass
distribution, magnetic field and angular momentum within the collapsing core
and study the episodic outflows and the fragmentation that occurs during the
collapse. The magnetic field has a drastic impact on the cloud evolution. We
find that magnetic braking is able to substantially reduce the angular momentum
in the inner part of the collapsing cloud. Fast and episodic outflows are being
launched with typical velocities of the order of 3-5 km s$^{-1}$ although the
highest velocities can be as high as 30-40 km s$^{-1}$. The fragmentation in
several objects, is reduced in substantially magnetized clouds with respect to
hydrodynamical ones by a factor of the order of 1.5-2. We conclude that
magnetic fields have a significant impact on the evolution of massive clumps.
In combination with radiation, magnetic fields largely determine the outcome of
massive core collapse. We stress that numerical convergence of MHD collapse is
a challenging issue. In particular, numerical diffusion appears to be important
at high density therefore possibly leading to an over-estimation of the number
of fragments.

minimization (also called Basis Pursuit Denoising or Lasso) in terms of
sparsity pattern recovery (support and sign consistency) from noisy
measurements with non-necessarily random noise, when the sensing operator
belongs to the Gaussian ensemble (i.e. random design matrix with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries). More precisely, we derive sharp non-asymptotic bounds on the
sparsity level and (minimal) signal-to-noise ratio that ensure support
identification for most signals and most Gaussian sensing matrices by solving
the Lasso problem with an appropriately chosen regularization parameter. Our
first purpose is to establish conditions allowing exact sparsity pattern
recovery when the signal is strictly sparse. Then, these conditions are
extended to cover the compressible or nearly sparse case. In these two results,
the role of the minimal signal-to-noise ratio is crucial. Our third main result
gets rid of this assumption in the strictly sparse case, but this time, the
Lasso allows only partial recovery of the support. We also provide in this case
a sharp $\ell_2$-consistency result on the coefficient vector. The results of
the present work have several distinctive features compared to previous ones.
One of them is that the leading constants involved in all the bounds are sharp
and explicit. This is illustrated by some numerical experiments where it is
indeed shown that the sharp sparsity level threshold identified by our
theoretical results below which sparsistency of the Lasso is guaranteed meets
that empirically observed.

flow through kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) measurements. As velocity tracers,
we use ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) clusters as well as expected cluster
catalogs from the upcoming missions Planck and eRosita (All-Sky Survey: EASS).
We implement a semi-analytical approach to simulate realistic Planck maps as
well as Planck and eRosita cluster catalogs. We adopt an unbiased kinetic SZ
filter (UF) and matched filter (MF) to maximize the cluster kSZ signal to noise
ratio. We find that the use of Planck CMB maps in conjunction with the
currently existing ROSAT cluster sample improves current upper limits on the
bulk flow determination by a factor \sim 5 (\sim 10) when using the MF (UF).
The accuracy of bulk flow measurement increases with the depth and abundance of
the cluster sample: for an input bulk velocity of 500 km/s, the UF recovered
velocity errors decrease from 94 km/s for RASS, to 73 km/s for Planck and to 24
km/s for EASS; while the systematic bias decreases from 44% for RASS, 5% for
Planck, to 0% for EASS. The 95% upper limit for the recovered bulk flow
direction \Delta {\alpha} ranges between 4 \circ and 60 \circ depending on
cluster sample and adopted filter. The kSZ dipole determination is mainly
limited by the effects of thermal SZ (tSZ) emission in all cases but the one of
EASS clusters analyzed with the unbiased filter. This fact makes the UF
preferable to the MF when analyzing Planck maps.

systematic decrease in temperature, increase in importance of high 13CO opacity
cores, increase in dust opacity, or decrease in 13CO abundance due to depletion
in regions of higher column density. We perform ellipsoidal and filamentary
virial analyses of the clouds, finding that the surface pressure terms are

(NH3)/graphene/Ni(111) system give an information about the kind of interaction
between adsorbed molecules and graphene on Ni(111). The presented experimental
data are compared with the results obtained in the framework of the DFT
approach.

studied in application to light-emitting cells. It is shown that the device
performance can be significantly improved by utilizing new fundamental
properties of the doping process. We obtain an instability, which distorts the
doping fronts and increases the doping rate considerably. We explain the
physical mechanism of the instability, develop theory, provide experimental
evidence, and perform numerical simulations. We further show how improved
device design can amplify the instability thus leading to a much faster doping
process and device kinetics.

whose states are orderings of a fixed finite set of items. We represent the
orderings as maximal chains in a graded poset. The most widely used ranking
models are parameterized by rational function in the model parameters, so they
define algebraic varieties. We study these varieties from the perspective of
combinatorial commutative algebra. One of our models, the Plackett-Luce model,
is non-toric. Five others are toric: the Birkhoff model, the ascending model,
the Csiszar model, the inversion model, and the Bradley-Terry model. For these
models we examine the toric algebra, its lattice polytope, and its Markov
basis.
