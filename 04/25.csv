Sun","Dynamics of Quantum Zeno and Anti-Zeno Effects in Open System","14pages, 7figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a general dynamical approach for the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno
effects in an open quantum system under repeated non-demolition measurements.
In our approach the repeated measurements are described by a general dynamical
model without the wave function collapse postulation. Based on that model, we
further study both the short-time and long-time evolutions of the open quantum
system under repeated non-demolition measurements, and derive the
measurement-modified decay rates of the excited state. In the cases with
frequent ideal measurements at zero-temperature, we re-obtain the same decay
rate as that from the wave function collapse postulation (Nature {\bf 405}, 546
(2000)). The correction to the ideal decay rate is also obtained under the
non-ideal measurements. Especially, we find that the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno
effects are possibly {\it enhanced} by the non-ideal natures of measurements.
For the open system under measurements with arbitrary period, we generally
derive the rate equation for the long-time evolution for the cases with {\it
arbitrary} temperature and noise spectrum, and show that in the long-time
evolution the noise spectrum is effectively tuned by the repeated measurements.
Our approach is also able to describe the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects
given by the phase modulation pulses, as well as the relevant quantum control
schemes.

already in several articles \cite{boundfirst}\cite{bound}

lighter - than half the Higgs mass. Higgs would in this case decay dominantly
to two of our bound states. If these bound states were indeed very light (say
around 10 GeV) their decay products into hadrons would like two jets, one for
each bound state. Even a very small mass for our bound state is not unexpected
isofar as it is part of our model that especially the top-quark-Yukawa coupling
is being tuned so as to make precisely this bound state of $6t + 6\bar{t}$
become (approximately) massless. This tuning is a consequence of our Multiple
Point Principle \cite{old} \cite{SIMPP} which states that the realized
parameter/coupling values correspond to having a maximal set of degenerate
vacua. Even the very recent LHC-peak in photon photon might be fitted to our

mathematics involving the notions of infinitely small, continuity etc.
Moreover, since classical mathematics has its own foundational problems which
cannot be resolved (as follows, in particular, from G\""{o}del's incompleteness
theorems), the ultimate physical theory cannot be based on that mathematics. In
the first part of the work we discuss inconsistencies in standard quantum
theory and reformulate the theory such that it can be naturally generalized to
a formulation based on finite mathematics. It is shown that: a) as a
consequence of inconsistent definition of standard position operator,
predictions of the theory contradict the data on observations of stars; b) the
cosmological acceleration and gravity can be treated simply as {\it
kinematical} manifestations of quantum de Sitter symmetry, {\it i.e. the
cosmological constant problem does not exist, and for describing those
phenomena the notions of dark energy, space-time background and gravitational
interaction are not needed}. In the second part we prove that classical
mathematics is a special degenerate case of finite mathematics in the formal
limit when the characteristic $p$ of the field or ring in the latter goes to
infinity. {\bf This implies that mathematics describing nature at the most
fundamental level involves only a finite number of numbers while the notions of
limit and infinitely small/large and the notions constructed from them (e.g.
continuity, derivative and integral) are needed only in calculations describing
nature approximately}. In a quantum theory based on finite mathematics, the de
Sitter gravitational constant depends on $p$ and disappears in the formal limit
$p\to\infty$, i.e. gravity is a consequence of finiteness of nature.

results uncover a new arena for fundamental studies on decoherence and enable
novel avenues for spin-based magnetometry and quantum information processing.

metallicity. This behavior is the opposite of that predicted by stellar
population models for a standard initial mass function. We show that this

shallower mass function for metal-rich GCs (with dN/dM ~ M^-0.8 to M^-1.3 below
one solar mass) can explain the bulk of extant observations. We also observe a
consistent, monotonic correlation between mass-to-light ratio and cluster mass.
This correlation, in contrast to the correlation with metallicity, is
well-explained by the accepted model of dynamical evolution of GCs through mass
segregation and the preferential loss of low-mass stars, and these data are
among the best available to constrain this process.

prove many their properties. Schwartz families are the analogous of infinite
dimensional matrices of separable Hilbert spaces, but for the Schwartz test
function spaces, having elements (functions) realizable as vectors indexed by
real Euclidean spaces (ordered families of scalars indexed by real Euclidean
spaces). In the paper, indeed, one of the consequences of the principal result
(the characterization of summability for Schwartz families) is that the space
of linear continuous operators among Schwartz test function spaces is linearly
isomorphic with the space of Schwartz families. It should be noticed that this
theorem is possible because of the very good properties of Schwartz test
function spaces and because of the particular structures of the Schwartz
families viewed as generalized matrices; in fact, any family of tempered
distribution, regarded as generalized matrix, has one index belonging to a
Euclidean space and one belonging to a test function space, so that any
Schwartz family is a matrix in the sense of distributions. Another motivation
for the introduction and study of these families is that these are the families
which are summable with respect to every tempered system of coefficients, in
the sense of superpositions. The Schwartz families we present in this paper are
one possible rigorous and simply manageable mathematical model for the infinite
matrices used frequently in Quantum Mechanics.

regions in the Sun in order to investigate the angular momentum evolution of
the radiative interior. Both hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic models were
run. We find an initial rapid adjustment in which the dif- ferential rotation
of the convection zone viscously spreads into the radiative interior, thus
forming a ""tachocline"". In polar regions the subsequent spread of the
tachocline is halted by a counter-rotating meridional circulation cell which
develops in the tachocline. Near the equator such a counter-rotating cell is
more intermittent and the tachocline penetration depth continues to increase,
albeit more slowly than previously predicted. In the magnetic models we impose
a dipolar field initially confined to the radiative interior. The behavior of
the magnetic models is very similar to their non-magnetic counter- parts.
Despite being connected to the convection zone, very little angular momentum is
transferred between the convective and radiative regions. Therefore, while it
appears that a magnetic field is not necessary to stop the tachocline spread,
it also does not promote such a spread if connected to the convection zone.

analogous of summable sequences in separable Hilbert spaces, but in tempered
distribution spaces, having elements (functional) realizable as generalized
vectors indexed by real Euclidean spaces (not pointwise defined ordered
families of scalars indexed by real Euclidean spaces in the sense of
distributions). Any family we introduce here is summable with respect to every
tempered system of coefficients belonging to a certain normal space of
distributions, in the sense of superpositions. The summable families we present

particularly powerful in deterministic domains. TSDT uses neither recency nor

be performed after apparently suboptimal actions have been taken. There are
additional advantages when using state abstraction, as in MAXQ. We demonstrate
that TSDT does significantly better than both Q-learning and Watkins'
Q(\lambda) in a deterministic cliff-walking domain. Results in a noisy
cliff-walking domain are less advantageous for TSDT, but demonstrate the

manner consistent with independent measures of nucleus rotation, but mixing

demonstrate that the ensemble average composition of gas released from the
nucleus is well defined, and relatively constant over the three-month interval

enough diverse vents must be active simultaneously to approximate (in sum) the
bulk composition of the nucleus. The released primary volatiles exhibit diverse
spatial properties which favor the presence of separate polar and apolar ice
phases in the nucleus, establish dust and gas release from icy clumps (and
also, directly from the nucleus), and provide insights into the driver for the

of an optimal multiple gravity assist (MGA) trajectory is a NP-hard mixed
combinatorial-continuous problem. Its automated solution would greatly improve
the design of future space missions, allowing the assessment of a large number
of alternative mission options in a short time. This work proposes to formulate
the complete automated design of a multiple gravity assist trajectory as an
autonomous planning and scheduling problem. The resulting scheduled plan will
provide the optimal planetary sequence and a good estimation of the set of
associated optimal trajectories. The trajectory model consists of a sequence of
celestial bodies connected by twodimensional transfer arcs containing one DSM.
For each transfer arc, the position of the planet and the spacecraft, at the
time of arrival, are matched by varying the pericentre of the preceding
swing-by, or the magnitude of the launch excess velocity, for the first arc.
For each departure date, this model generates a full tree of possible transfers
from the departure to the destination planet. Each leaf of the tree represents
a planetary encounter and a possible way to reach that planet. An algorithm
inspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is devised to explore the space of
possible plans. The ants explore the tree from departure to destination adding
one node at the time: every time an ant is at a node, a probability function is
used to select a feasible direction. This approach to automatic trajectory
planning is applied to the design of optimal transfers to Saturn and among the
Galilean moons of Jupiter.

direction cannot be achieved for every asteroid at any time; therefore, an
analysis of the optimal launch opportunities for deviating a number of selected

than the BYORP effect and the mutual orbit semi-major axis expands to the
equilibrium; outside of the equilibrium, the BYORP effect dominates the
evolution and the system semi-major axis will contract to the equilibrium. If
the observed population of small (0.1 - 10 km diameter) synchronous binaries
are in static configurations that are no longer evolving, then this would be
confirmed by a null result in the observational tests for the BYORP effect. The
confirmed existence of this equilibrium combined with a shape model of the
secondary of the system enables the direct study of asteroid geophysics through
the tidal theory. The observed synchronous asteroid population cannot exist in
this equilibrium if described by the canonical ""monolithic"" geophysical model.
The ""rubble pile"" geophysical model proposed by \citet{Goldreich2009} is
sufficient, however it predicts a tidal Love number directly proportional to
the radius of the asteroid, while the best fit to the data predicts a tidal
Love number inversely proportional to the radius. This deviation from the

phase. By tuning the nearest neighbor interaction, one can realize the
transition between two insulating phases, Mott and CDW with the same particle
density, which turns out to be of the first-order. We also demonstrate that a
supersolid phase with average particle density less than 1/2 can exist in a
small region of $\mu$ - V phase diagram.

hierarchies into integral solutions, based on a connection between these
hierarchies and the spectrum of the input graph. We demonstrate the utility of
our method by providing a new SDP-hierarchy based algorithm for constraint
satisfaction problems with 2-variable constraints (2-CSP's).
  More concretely, we show for every 2-CSP instance I a rounding algorithm for
r rounds of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy for I that obtains an integral solution
that is at most \eps worse than the relaxation's value (normalized to lie in
[0,1]), as long as r > k\cdot\rank_{\geq \theta}(\Ins)/\poly(\e) \;, where k is
the alphabet size of I, $\theta=\poly(\e/k)$, and $\rank_{\geq \theta}(\Ins)$
denotes the number of eigenvalues larger than $\theta$ in the normalized
adjacency matrix of the constraint graph of $\Ins$.
  In the case that $\Ins$ is a \uniquegames instance, the threshold $\theta$ is
only a polynomial in $\e$, and is independent of the alphabet size. Also in
this case, we can give a non-trivial bound on the number of rounds for
\emph{every} instance. In particular our result yields an SDP-hierarchy based
algorithm that matches the performance of the recent subexponential algorithm
of Arora, Barak and Steurer (FOCS 2010) in the worst case, but runs faster on a
natural family of instances, thus further restricting the set of possible hard
instances for Khot's Unique Games Conjecture.
  Our algorithm actually requires less than the $n^{O(r)}$ constraints
specified by the $r^{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy, and in some cases
$r$ rounds of our program can be evaluated in time $2^{O(r)}\poly(n)$.

there is no convincing explanation for the scaling relation between rank and
size and its scaling exponent. Based on the idea from general fractals and
scaling, this paper proposes a dual competition hypothesis of city develop to
explain the value intervals and the special value, 1, of the power exponent.
Zipf's law and Pareto's law can be mathematically transformed into one another.
Based on the Pareto distribution, a frequency correlation function can be
constructed. By scaling analysis and multifractals spectrum, the parameter
interval of Pareto exponent is derived as (0.5, 1]; Based on the Zipf
distribution, a size correlation function can be built, and it is opposite to
the first one. By the second correlation function and multifractals notion, the
Pareto exponent interval is derived as [1, 2). Thus the process of urban
evolution falls into two effects: one is Pareto effect indicating city number
increase (external complexity), and the other Zipf effect indicating city size
growth (internal complexity). Because of struggle of the two effects, the
scaling exponent varies from 0.5 to 2; but if the two effects reach equilibrium
with each other, the scaling exponent approaches 1. A series of mathematical
experiments on hierarchical correlation are employed to verify the models and a
conclusion can be drawn that if cities in a given region follow Zipf's law, the
frequency and size correlations will follow the scaling law. This theory can be
generalized to interpret the inverse power-law distributions in various fields
of physical and social sciences.

scattering (RIXS) from undoped cuprates. We analyze the second-order dipole
allowed process that the strong perturbation works through the intermediate
state in which the spin degree of freedom is lost at the core-hole site. Within
the approximation neglecting the perturbation on the neighboring sites, we
derive the spin-flip final state in the scattering channel with changing the
polarization, which leads to the RIXS spectra expressed as the dynamical
structure factor of the transverse spin components. We assume a spherical form
of the spin-conserving final state in the channel without changing the
polarization, which leads to the RIXS spectra expressed as the 'exchange'-type
multi-spin correlation function. Evaluating numerically the transition
amplitudes to these final states on a finite-size cluster, we obtain a sizable
amount of the transition amplitude to the spin-conserving final state in
comparison with that to the spin-flip final state. We treat the itinerant
magnetic excitations in the final state by means of the 1/S-expansion method.
Evaluating the higher-order correction with 1/S, we find that the peak arising
from the one-magnon excitation is reduced with its weight, and the continuous
spectra arising from the three-magnon excitations come out. The interaction
between two magnons is treated by summing up the ladder diagrams. On the basis
of these results, we analyze the L_3-edge RIXS spectra in Sr_2CuO_2Cl_2 in
comparison with the experiment. It is shown that the three-magnon excitations
as well as the two-magnon excitations give rise to the intensity in the high
energy side of the one-magnon peak, making the spectral shape asymmetric with
wide width, in good agreement with the experiment.

long-duration GRBs (L-GRBs), short-duration GRBs (S-GRBs), and short-duration
GRBs with extended emission (S-GRBs with E.E.) to investigate differences in
the prompt emission properties. The fraction of L-GRBs, S-GRBs and S-GRBs with
E.E. in the catalog are 89%, 8% and 2% respectively. We compare the BAT prompt
emission properties with the BATSE, BeppoSAX and HETE-2 GRB samples. We also
correlate the observed prompt emission properties with the redshifts for the
GRBs with known redshift. The BAT T90 and T50 durations peak at 70 s and 30 s,
respectively. We confirm that the spectra of the BAT S-GRBs are generally
harder than those of the L-GRBs. The time-averaged spectra of the BAT S-GRBs
with E.E. are similar to those of the L-GRBs. Whereas, the spectra of the
initial short spikes of the S-GRBs with E.E. are similar to those of the
S-GRBs. We show that the BAT GRB samples are significantly softer than the
BATSE bright GRBs, and that the time-averaged Epeak of the BAT GRBs peaks at 80
keV which is significantly lower energy than those of the BATSE sample which
peak at 320 keV. The time-averaged spectral properties of the BAT GRB sample
are similar to those of the HETE-2 GRB samples. By time-resolved spectral
analysis, we find that only 10% of the BAT observed photon indices are outside
the allowed region of the synchrotron shock model.

In this paper, a new way to improve the reliability of message transmission is

maliciously or selfishly disrupt and deny communication of other nodes. Dynamic
changing topology makes it hard to determine the adversary nodes that affect
the communication in MANET. An SMT protocol provides a way to secure message

This paper describes a technique for fault discovery process to identify

detects a malicious link through binary search and according to the nodes
behavior, these links are avoided in the active path by multiplicatively
increasing their weights. The proposed scheme provides secure communication

since they are generated as a result of supersonic motion of galaxies through
the intergalactic medium. The goal of this work is to present an analytical
solution technique for such astrophysical hypersonic blunt body problems.
Methods: A method, developed by Schneider (1968, JFM, 31, 397) in the context
of aeronautics, allows calculation of the galaxy's shape as long as the shape
of the bow shock wave is known (so-called inverse method). In contrast to other
analytical models, the solution is valid in the whole flow region (from the
stagnation point up to the bow shock wings) and in particular takes into
account velocity gradients along the streamlines. We compare our analytical
results with two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations carried out with an
extended version of the VH-1 hydrocode which is based on the piecewise
parabolic method with a Lagrangian remap. Results: It is shown that the applied
method accurately predicts the galaxy's shape and the fluid variables in the
post-shock flow, thus saving a tremendous amount of computing time for future
interpretations of similar objects. We also find that the method can be applied
to arbitrary angles between the direction of the incoming flow and the axis of
symmetry of the body. We emphasize that it is general enough to be applied to
other astrophysical bow shocks, such as those on stellar and galactic scales.

decide assisting relays and manage the energy resource at the source and each

performance. This paper addresses the sum rate maximized resource allocation
(RA) problem in a point to point orthogonal frequency division modulation
(OFDM) transmission system assisted by multiple decode-and-forward (DF) relays,
subject to the individual sum power constraints of the source and the relays.
In particular, the transmission at each subcarrier can be in either the direct
mode without any relay assisting, or the relay-aided mode with one or several
relays assisting. We propose two RA algorithms which optimize the assignment of
transmission mode and source power for every subcarrier, as well as the
assisting relays and the power allocation to them for every {relay-aided}
subcarrier. First, it is shown that the considered RA problem has zero
Lagrangian duality gap when there is a big number of subcarriers. In this case,
a duality based algorithm that finds a globally optimum RA is developed.
Second, a coordinate-ascent based iterative algorithm, which finds a suboptimum
RA but is always applicable regardless of the duality gap of the RA problem, is
developed. The effectiveness of these algorithms has been illustrated by
numerical experiments.

heavily upon the identification of an appropriate distance metric on the input
data. It is often beneficial to learn such a metric from the input training
data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this
work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BoostMetric, for learning a
quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance
metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the
metric remains positive definite. Semidefinite programming is often used to
enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and easy to implement.
BoostMetric is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite
matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one
matrices. BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak
learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The
resulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various
types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its
weak learner is a positive semidefinite matrix with trace and rank being one
rather than a classifier or regressor. Experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and running time.

the ratio between Kitaev and Heisenberg interactions. We show that in the

for the transition to the polarized phase when including quantum fluctuations
perturbatively. Effects of spin vacancies depend sensitively on the type of the

vacancy in a small field is determined, and its spatial anisotropy is related
to that of non-zero further neighbor correlations induced by the field and/or
Heisenberg interactions. In the stripe phase, the joint effect of a vacancy and
a small field breaks the six-fold symmetry of the model and stabilizes a
particular stripe pattern. Similar symmetry-breaking effects occur even at zero
field due to effective interactions between vacancies. This selection mechanism
and intrinsic randomness of vacancy positions may lead to spin-glass behavior.

the phase-separated states. These first-principle calculations further reveal
that the intrinsic piezoelectric response of these two low-symmetry triclinic

transition between these two energetically close triclinic phases is likely
responsible for the large piezoelectric response found in the BiFeO3 films near
its MPB. These findings not only enrich the understandings of the lattice and

explain the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. This model
originates from the Veneziano ghost of QCD. The dark energy density is
proportional to Hubble parameter, $\rho_D=\alpha H$, where $\alpha$ is a
constant of order $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^3$ and $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\sim 100 MeV$ is
QCD mass scale. In this paper, we extend the ghost dark energy model to the
universe with spatial curvature in the presence of interaction between dark
matter and dark energy. We study cosmological implications of this model in
detail. In the absence of interaction the equation of state parameter of ghost
dark energy is always $w_D > -1 $ and mimics a cosmological constant in the
late time, while it is possible to have $w_D < -1 $ provided the interaction is
taken into account. When $k = 0$, all previous results of ghost dark energy in
flat universe are recovered. To check the observational consistency, we use
Supernova type Ia (SNIa) Gold sample, shift parameter of Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation (CMB) and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation peak from

$\Omega_D^0=0.75_{-0.04}^{+0.01}$ and $b^2=0.08^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$. Consequently

  We argue that, due to a residual CP symmetry, the quantum Hall ferromagnet
order parameter is given exactly by the leading order in perturbation theory.
On the other hand, the chiral condensate which is the order parameter for
chiral symmetry breaking generically obtains contributions at all orders. We
compute the leading correction to the chiral condensate. We argue that the
ensuing fermion spectrum resembles that of massive fermions with a vanishing
U(4)-valued chemical potential. We discuss the realization of parity and charge
conjugation symmetries and argue that, in the context of our model, the charge
neutral quantum Hall state in graphene is a bulk insulator, with vanishing

stars will be sampled in DES grizY filters. This roughly corresponds to 20% of
all DES sources. Most of these stars belong to the stellar thick disk and halo
of the Galaxy. DES will probe low-mass stellar and sub-stellar objects at
depths from 3 to 8 times larger than SDSS. The faint end of the main-sequence
will be densely sampled beyond 10 kpc. The slope of the low mass end of the
stellar IMF will be constrained to within a few hundredth dex, even in the
thick disk and halo. In the sub-stellar mass regime, the IMF slope will be
potentially constrained to within dlog \phi(m) / dlog m ~ 0.1$. About 3x10^4
brown dwarf and at least 7.6x10^5 white dwarf candidates will be selected, the
latter embedded into the thick disk and halo. The stellar halo flattening will

of new Milky Way satellites and halo clusters for distances out to ~ 120 kpc,
therefore yielding stellar surface density contrasts 1.6-1.7 times larger than
those attainable with SDSS. It will also allow detection of these objects in
the far reaches of the stellar halo, substantially increasing the number and
quality of probes to the Galactic potential. Combined with northern samples,

investigate the L-sigma relation in conjunction with optical spectrophotometric
observations. Peculiarities in the line profiles such as sharp lines, wings,
asymmetries, and in some cases more than one component in emission were
verified. From a new independent homogeneous set of spectrophotometric data we
derived physical condition parameters and performed the statistical principal
component analysis. We have investigated the potential role of metallicity
(O/H), Hbeta equivalent width (WHbeta) and ionization ratio [OIII]/[OII] to
account for the observational scatter of L-sigma relation. Our results indicate
that the L-sigma relation for HIIGs is more sensitive to the evolution of the
current starburst event (short-term evolution) and dated by WHbeta or even the
[OIII]/[OII] ratio. The long-term evolution measured by O/H also plays a
potential role in determining the luminosity of the current burst for a given
velocity dispersion and age as previously suggested. Additionally, galaxies
showing Gaussian line profiles present more tight correlations indicating that
they are best targets for the application of the parametric relations as an
extragalactic cosmological distance indicator. Best fits for a restricted
homogeneous sample of 45 HIIGs provide us a set of new extragalactic distance
indicators with an RMS scatter compatible with observational errors of
Delta_log(LHalpha) = 0.2 dex or 0.5 mag. Improvements may still come from
future optimized observational programs to reduce the observational
uncertainties on the predicted luminosities of HIIGs in order to achieve the
precision required for the application of these relations as tests of
cosmological models.

  Main idea. Let P_n(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. It is easy
to prove that <P_n(x)ln(x+1)>=a_n+<ln(x+1)>b_n$ for some integers a_n, b_n.

explanatory framework whose importance, in this author's view, has been
seriously underappreciated by the physics community, despite its success in
clarifying many conceptual challenges of quantum physics. Secondly, it aims to
introduce a new quantum-machine - that we call the delta-quantum-machine -
which is able to reproduce the transmission and reflection probabilities of a
one-dimensional quantum scattering process by a Dirac delta-function potential.
The machine is used not only to demonstrate the pertinence of the above
mentioned explanatory framework, in the general description of physical
systems, but also to illustrate (in the spirit of Aerts' epsilon-model) the
origin of classical and quantum structures, by revealing the existence of
processes which are neither classical nor quantum, but irreducibly
intermediate. We do this by explicitly introducing what we call the k-model and
by proving that its processes cannot be modelized by a classical or quantum
scattering system. The third purpose of this work is to exploit the powerful
metaphor provided by our quantum-machine, to investigate the intimate relation
between the concept of potentiality and the notion of non-spatiality, that we
characterize in precise terms, introducing for this the new concept of
process-actuality.

autocorrelated increments as a tractable model for problems in business and
finance. We show that any real continuous Gaussian Markov process with
stationary increments and smooth covariance function is characterized by three
parameters quantifying drift, volatility, and autocorrelations. We model a
queue as a functional of a process defined by those characteristics and derive
its transient distribution conditional on its history.

  governed by a general point process",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We suggest a general method for analyzing aggregate insurance claims that
arrive according to a very general point process, known in the literature as
the order statistic point process, which includes as special cases the
classical compound Poisson and the Sparre Andersen models, among many others.
We also allow for the process to govern claim sizes via a general dependence
structure that relates claim sizes to claim and/or inter-claim times. The
obtained general results are supplemented with special closed-form illustrative
formulas, that also exemplify the potential for future research in the area.

applying a charge current through nonmagnetic contacts.

analyze the incidence of individuals heterogeneities in the spread of an
infectious disease. In this work we focus our attention on human contacts
heterogeneities through two of the main individual-based models: mobile agents
and complex networks models. We introduce a novel mobile agents model in which
individuals make displacements with sizes according to a truncated power-law
distribution based on empirical evidence about human mobility. Besides, we
present a procedure to obtain an equivalent weighted contact network from the
previous mobile agents model, where the weights of the links are interpreted as
contact probabilities. From the topological analysis of the equivalent contact
networks we show that small world characteristics are related with truncated
power-law distribution for agent displacements. Finally, we show the
equivalence between both approaches through some numerical experiments for the
spread of an infectious disease.
