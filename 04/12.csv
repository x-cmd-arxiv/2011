differential equations. Because computable closed-form solutions only exist for
very simple differential equations, proof certificates have been proposed for
more scalable verification. Search procedures for these proof certificates are
still rather ad-hoc, though, because the problem structure is only understood
poorly. We investigate differential invariants, which define an induction
principle for differential equations and which can be checked for invariance
along a differential equation just by using their differential structure,
without having to solve them. We study the structural properties of
differential invariants. To analyze trade-offs for proof search complexity, we
identify more than a dozen relations between several classes of differential
invariants and compare their deductive power. As our main results, we analyze
the deductive power of differential cuts and the deductive power of
differential invariants with auxiliary differential variables. We refute the
differential cut elimination hypothesis and show that, unlike standard cuts,
differential cuts are fundamental proof principles that strictly increase the
deductive power. We also prove that the deductive power increases further when
adding auxiliary differential variables to the dynamics.

penalty to the cost function of a static clustering method. In this paper, we
introduce a different approach to evolutionary clustering by accurately
tracking the time-varying proximities between objects followed by static
clustering. We present an evolutionary clustering framework that adaptively
estimates the optimal smoothing parameter using shrinkage estimation, a
statistical approach that improves a naive estimate using additional
information. The proposed framework can be used to extend a variety of static
clustering algorithms, including hierarchical, k-means, and spectral
clustering, into evolutionary clustering algorithms. Experiments on synthetic

flat double sided mirrors that focus in one dimension and utilize a coded mask
for resolution in the other. Their positioning accuracy is about an arc minute.
The two remaining modules are made from the same materials but configured as a
Kirkpatrick-Baez telescope with longer focal length that focuses in two
dimensions. When pointed it refines the hybrid telescope's arc minute positions
to an arc second and provides larger effective area for spectral and temporal
measurements. Above 10 keV the mirrors act as an imaging collimator with
positioning capability. For short duration events this hybrid focusing/coded
mask system is more sensitive and versatile than either a 2D coded mask or a 2D
lobster-eye telescope. Very wide field X-ray telescopes have become feasible as
the ability to fabricate large area arrays of CCD and CMOS detectors has
improved. This instrument's function in the soft X-ray band is similar to that
of Swift in hard X-ray band and there are a greater variety of fast transients

and families of closed subschemes in the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ with a
fixed Hilbert polynomial $p(t)$. It is classically realized as a closed
subscheme of a Grassmannian or a product of Grassmannians. In this paper we
consider schemes over a field $k$ of characteristic zero and we present a new
proof of the existence of the Hilbert scheme as a subscheme of the Grassmannian
$\mathbf{Gr}_{p(r)}^{N(r)}$, where $N(r)= h^0 (\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(r))$.
Moreover, we exhibit explicit equations defining it in the Pl\""ucker
coordinates of the Pl\""ucker embedding of $\mathbf{Gr}_{p(r)}^{N(r)}$. Our
proof of existence does not need some of the classical tools used in previous
proofs, as flattening stratifications and Gotzmann's Persistence Theorem. The
degree of our equations is $\text{deg} p(t)+2$, lower than the degree of the
equations given by Iarrobino and Kleiman in 1999 and also lower (except for the
case of hypersurfaces) than the degree of those proved by Haiman and Sturmfels
in 2004 after Bayer's conjecture in 1982. The novelty of our approach mainly
relies on the deeper attention to the intrinsic symmetries of the Hilbert
scheme and on some results about Grassmannian based on the notion of extensors.

continuum, is similar to that measured at low-z (z~1), but the equivalent width
of the emission lines are larger at low redshift. We calculate the correlation
between fluxes at different wavelengths and find that the emission line fluxes
in the red part of the spectrum are correlated with that in the blue part. We
construct a projection matrix to predict the continuum in the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest from the red part of the spectrum. We apply this matrix to quasars in
the SDSS-DR7 to derive the evolution with redshift of the mean flux in the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest due to the absorption by the intergalactic neutral
hydrogen. A change in the evolution of the mean flux is apparent around z~3 in
the sense of a steeper decrease of the mean flux at higher redshifts. The same
evolution is found when the continuum is estimated from the extrapolation of a
power-law continuum fitted in the red part of the quasar spectrum if a
correction, derived from simple simulations, is applied. Our findings are
consistent with previous determinations using high spectral resolution data. We

this concept to the case where players are engaged in a local contribution game
and show that rationality and credibility of threats identify a class of Nash
equilibria -- that we call ""collaborative equilibria"" -- that have a precise
interpretation in terms of sub-graphs of the social network. For large network
games, the number of such equilibria is exponentially large in the number of
players. When incentives to defect are small, equilibria are supported by local
structures whereas when incentives exceed a threshold they acquire a non-local
nature, which requires a ""critical mass"" of more than a given fraction of the
players to collaborate. Therefore, when incentives are high, an individual
deviation typically causes the collapse of collaboration across the whole
system. At the same time, higher incentives to defect typically support
equilibria with a higher density of collaborators. The resulting picture
conforms with several results in sociology and in the experimental literature
on game theory, such as the prevalence of collaboration in denser groups and in
the structural hubs of sparse networks.

to undergo continual/secular heating. Two other simulations are in better
agreement with the Quillen & Garnett (2001) observations that suggest a

the kinematics of disc stars at the time of their birth for different epochs in

cold within the disc and are subsequently heated, while other simulations
possess old stellar populations which are born relatively hot. The models which
are in better agreement with observations of the Milky Way's stellar disc
undergo significantly lower minor-merger/assembly activity after the last major

significantly ""hotter"" than the Milky Way disc; on top of the effects of
mergers, we find a ""floor"" in the dispersion that is related to the underlying
treatment of the heating and cooling of the interstellar medium, and the low

Nebula Cluster (ONC) is that they form via the rapid, efficient collapse of a
bound gas clump within a larger, gravitationally-unbound giant molecular cloud.
However, simulations in support of this scenario have thus far have not
included the radiation feedback produced by the stars; radiative simulations
have been limited to significantly smaller or lower density regions. Here we
use the ORION adaptive mesh refinement code to conduct the first ever
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the global collapse scenario for the
formation of an ONC-like cluster. We show that radiative feedback has a
dramatic effect on the evolution: once the first ~10-20% of the gas mass is
incorporated into stars, their radiative feedback raises the gas temperature
high enough to suppress any further fragmentation. However, gas continues to
accrete onto existing stars, and, as a result, the stellar mass distribution
becomes increasingly top-heavy, eventually rendering it incompatible with the
observed IMF. Systematic variation in the location of the IMF peak as star
formation proceeds is incompatible with the observed invariance of the IMF
between star clusters, unless some unknown mechanism synchronizes the IMFs in
different clusters by ensuring that star formation is always truncated when the
IMF peak reaches a particular value. We therefore conclude that the global
collapse scenario, at least in its simplest form, is not compatible with the
observed stellar IMF. We speculate that processes that slow down star
formation, and thus reduce the accretion luminosity, may be able to resolve the
problem.

objective of identifying the likely source of the excitation. We investigate
the variability of the 6.4-keV line emission of four clouds through spectral
fitting of the EPIC MOS data with the use of a modelled background, which
avoids many of the systematics inherent in local background subtraction. We
also employ spectral stacking of both EPIC PN and MOS data to search for
evidence of an Fe-K edge feature imprinted on the underlying X-ray continuum.
The lightcurves of the Fe-Ka line from three bright molecular knots close to
the Arches cluster are found to be constant over the 8-year observation window.
West of the cluster, however, we found a bright cloud exhibiting the fastest
Fe-Ka variability yet seen in a molecular cloud in the Galactic Center region.
The time-averaged spectra of the molecular clouds reveal no convincing evidence
of the 7.1-keV edge feature. The EW of the 6.4-keV line emitted by the clouds
near the cluster is found to be ~1.0 keV. The observed Fe-Ka line flux and the
high EW suggest the fluorescence has a photoionization origin, although
excitation by cosmic-ray particles is not specifically excluded. For the three
clouds nearest to the cluster, an identification of the source of
photo-ionizing photons with an earlier outburst of Sgr A* is however at best
tentative. The hardness of the nonthermal component associated with the 6.4-keV
line emission might be best explained in terms of bombardment by cosmic-ray
particles from the Arches cluster itself. The relatively short-timescale
variability seen in the 6.4-keV line emission from the cloud to the West of the
cluster is most likely the result of illumination by a nearby transient X-ray
source.

fundamental questions in physics today. In the absence of a compelling theory
to explain the observations, a first task is to develop a robust phenomenology.
If the acceleration is driven by some form of dark energy, then, the
phenomenology is determined by the dark energy equation of state w. A major aim
of ongoing and upcoming cosmological surveys is to measure w and its time
dependence at high accuracy. Since w(z) is not directly accessible to
measurement, powerful reconstruction methods are needed to extract it reliably
from observations. We have recently introduced a new reconstruction method for
w(z) based on Gaussian process modeling. This method can capture nontrivial
time-dependences in w(z) and, most importantly, it yields controlled and
unbaised error estimates. In this paper we extend the method to include a
diverse set of measurements: baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic microwave
background measurements, and supernova data. We analyze currently available
data sets and present the resulting constraints on w(z), finding that current
observations are in very good agreement with a cosmological constant. In
addition we explore how well our method captures nontrivial behavior of w(z) by
analyzing simulated data assuming high-quality observations from future
surveys. We find that the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by
themselves already lead to remarkably good reconstruction results and that the
combination of different high-quality probes allows us to reconstruct w(z) very
reliably with small error bounds.

and radiative model to investigate pair production by \gamma\gamma collisions
in weakly radiative accretion flows around a black hole of mass M and accretion
rate \dot{M}. Our flow model is drawn from general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and our radiation field is computed by a Monte
Carlo transport scheme assuming the electron distribution function is thermal.
We argue that the pair production rate scales as r^{-6} M^{-1} \dot{M}^{6}. We
confirm this numerically and calibrate the scaling relation. This relation is
self-consistent in a wedge in M, \dot{M} parameter space. If \dot{M} is too low
the implied pair density over the poles of the black hole is below the
Goldreich-Julian density and \gamma\gamma pair production is relatively
unimportant; if \dot{M} is too high the models are radiatively efficient. We
also argue that for a power-law spectrum the pair production rate should scale
with the observables L_X \equiv X-ray luminosity and M as L_X^2 M^{-4}. We
confirm this numerically and argue that this relation likely holds even for
radiatively efficient flows. The pair production rates are sensitive to black
hole spin and to the ion-electron temperature ratio which are fixed in this
exploratory calculation. We finish with a brief discussion of the implications

spin correlations that contain valuable coupling information. When the tops
decay, these correlations imprint themselves on the angular patterns of the
final quarks and leptons. While many approaches to the measurement of top spin
correlations are known, the most common ones require detailed kinematic
reconstructions and are insensitive to some important spin interference
effects. In particular, spin-1 resonances with mostly-vector or mostly-axial
couplings to top cannot be easily discriminated from one another without
appealing to mass-suppressed effects or to more model-dependent interference
with continuum Standard Model production. Here, we propose to probe the
structure of a resonance's couplings to tops by measuring the azimuthal angles
of the tops' decay products about the production axis. These angles exhibit
modulations which are typically O(0.1-1), and which by themselves allow for
discrimination of spin-0 from higher spins, measurement of the CP-phase for
spin-0, and measurement of the vector/axial composition for spins 1 and 2. For
relativistic tops, the azimuthal decay angles can be well-approximated without
detailed knowledge of the tops' velocities, and appear to be robust against
imperfect energy measurements and neutrino reconstructions. We illustrate this
point in the highly challenging dileptonic decay mode, which also exhibits the
largest modulations. We comment on the relevance of these observables for
testing axigluon-like models that explain the top quark A_FB anomaly at the
Tevatron, through direct production at the LHC.

introduction of the SU(2)_L triplets belonging to the (15,1)+(\bar{15},1)

all abundant elements between C and Ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. The
mission will answer questions such as: When were the first metals created? How
does the cosmic metal content evolve? Where do most of the metals reside in the
Universe? What is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? To
reach out to the early Universe ORIGIN will use Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) to
study their local environments in their host galaxies. This requires the
capability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the GRB location. By
studying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we can
extend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). For this task we
need a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.
Using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detected

the class of polar disk galaxies as whole. The present work aims at checking
the cold accretion of gas through a ""cosmic filament"" as a possible scenario
for the formation of the polar structures in UGC7576 and UGC9796. If these form
by cold accretion, we expect the HII regions abundances and metallicities to be
lower than those of same-luminosity spiral disks, with values of the order of Z
~ 1/10 Zsun, as predicted by cosmological simulations. We have used deep
long-slit spectra, obtained with DOLORES@TNG in the optical wavelengths, of the
brightest HII regions associated with the polar structures to derive their
chemical abundances and star formation rate. We used the ""Empirical methods"",
based on the intensities of easily observable lines, to derive the oxygen
abundance 12+log(O/H) of both galaxies. Such values are compared with those
typical for different morphological galaxy types of comparable luminosity. The
average metallicity values for UGC7576 and UGC9796 are Z = 0.4 Zsun and Z = 0.1

the trivariate instantaneous bandwidth---a measure of the instantaneous

are systems where the bulk of the degrees of freedom is frozen and is
practically statistically inactive. Systems governed by generalized entropies

permutability. There exists a compound reversible transformation on any system
effecting any given permutation of any given maximal set of distinguishable
states for that system. [P5] Sturdiness. Filters are non-flattening. Hence,
from these postulates we can reconstruct all the usual features of quantum

completely positive trace non-increasing maps, and effects by positive

the entropy must be of Boltzmann-Gibbs type, $S=-\sum_i p_i \log p_i$. Here we
note that in physical systems one of these axioms may be violated. For
non-ergodic systems the so called separation axiom (Shannon-Khinchin axiom 4)
will in general not be valid. We show that when this axiom is violated the
entropy takes a more general form, $S_{c,d}\propto \sum_i ^W \Gamma(d+1, 1- c
\log p_i)$, where $c$ and $d$ are scaling exponents and $\Gamma(a,b)$ is the
incomplete gamma function. The exponents $(c,d)$ define equivalence classes for
all interacting and non interacting systems and unambiguously characterize any
statistical system in its thermodynamic limit. The proof is possible because of
two newly discovered scaling laws which any entropic form has to fulfill, if
the first three Shannon-Khinchin axioms hold. $(c,d)$ can be used to define
equivalence classes of statistical systems. A series of known entropies can be
classified in terms of these equivalence classes. We show that the
corresponding distribution functions are special forms of Lambert-${\cal W}$
exponentials containing -- as special cases -- Boltzmann, stretched exponential
and Tsallis distributions (power-laws). In the derivation we assume trace form
entropies, $S=\sum_i g(p_i)$, with $g$ some function, however more general
entropic forms can be classified along the same scaling analysis.

the query Q is then executed on D', hence avoiding to allocate and process
nodes that will never be reached by Q. In this article, we propose a new
approach, based on types, that greatly improves current solutions. Besides
providing comparable or greater precision and far lesser pruning overhead, our
solution ---unlike current approaches--- takes into account backward axes,
predicates, and can be applied to multiple queries rather than just to single
ones. A side contribution is a new type system for XPath able to handle
backward axes. The soundness of our approach is formally proved. Furthermore,
we prove that the approach is also complete (i.e., yields the best possible
type-driven pruning) for a relevant class of queries and Schemas. We further
validate our approach using the XMark and XPathMark benchmarks and show that
pruning not only improves the main memory query engine's performances (as
expected) but also those of state of the art native XML databases.

for cluster cosmology from photometric catalogs. We consider various
modifications to the red-sequence matched filter richness estimator of Rozo et
al. (2009), and evaluate their impact on the scatter in X-ray luminosity at
fixed richness. Most significantly, we find that deeper luminosity cuts can
reduce the recovered scatter, finding that sigma_lnLX|lambda=0.63+/-0.02 for
clusters with M_500c >~ 1.6e14 h_70^-1 M_sun. The corresponding scatter in mass
at fixed richness is sigma_lnM|lambda ~ 0.2-0.3 depending on the richness,
comparable to that for total X-ray luminosity. We find that including blue
galaxies in the richness estimate increases the scatter, as does weighting
galaxies by their optical luminosity. We further demonstrate that our richness
estimator is very robust. Specifically, the filter employed when estimating
richness can be calibrated directly from the data, without requiring a-priori
calibrations of the red-sequence. We also demonstrate that the recovered
richness is robust to up to 50% uncertainties in the galaxy background, as well
as to the choice of photometric filter employed, so long as the filters span
the 4000 A break of red-sequence galaxies. Consequently, our richness estimator
can be used to compare richness estimates of different clusters, even if they
do not share the same photometric data. Appendix 1 includes ""easy-bake""

21cm background from the epoch of reionization and beyond introduces an
anisotropy in the three-dimensional power spectrum of brightness temperature
fluctuations. Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is a
promising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. However,
previous attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or
only approximated it crudely. This paper re-examines the effects of peculiar
velocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment and
addressing several issues for the first time. (1) We show that properly
accounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of
21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the IGM found by previous
work that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) The
approximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightness
temperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the power
spectrum on all scales. (3) The observed power spectrum in redshift-space
remains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properly
accounts for the redshift-space distortion. However, results that take full
account of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accurate
in the limit of high spin temperature. (4) The linear theory for redshift-space
distortion results in ~30% error in the observationally relevant wavenumber
range, at the 50% ionized epoch. (5) We describe and test two numerical schemes
to calculate the 21cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporate
peculiar velocity effects in the optically-thin approximation accurately. One
is particle-based, the other grid-based, and while the former is most accurate,
we demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and can
achieve sufficient accuracy. [Abridged]

rotator in the large boson number limit of the Interacting Boson Approximation
(IBA) model, a line is found inside the symmetry triangle of the IBA, along
which the SU(3) symmetry is preserved. The line extends from the SU(3) vertex
to near the critical line of the first order shape/phase transition separating
the spherical and prolate deformed phases, and lies within the Alhassid--Whelan
arc of regularity, the unique valley of regularity connecting the SU(3) and
U(5) vertices amidst chaotic regions. In addition to providing an explanation
for the existence of the arc of regularity, the present line represents the
first example of an analytically determined approximate symmetry in the
interior of the symmetry triangle of the IBA. The method is applicable to
algebraic models possessing subalgebras amenable to contraction. This condition
is equivalent to algebras in which the equilibrium ground state (and its
rotational band) become energetically isolated from intrinsic excitations, as
typified by deformed solutions to the IBA for large numbers of valence
nucleons.

mild assumptions -- bounded noise, high enough minimum nonzero coefficient
magnitude increase rate, and large enough number of measurements at every time.
A direct corollary is that the reconstruction error is also bounded by a
time-invariant value at all times. If the support set of the sparse signal
sequence changes slowly over time, our results hold under weaker assumptions
than what simple compressive sensing (CS) needs for the same error bound. Also,
our support error bounds are small compared to the support size. Our discussion
is backed up by Monte Carlo simulation based comparisons.

at the transmitter and two-users (each with a single antenna) is considered. It
is assumed that the users have perfect channel information about their links
whereas the transmitter has only statistical information of each user's link
(covariance matrix of the vector channel). A low-complexity linear beamforming
strategy that allocates equal power and one spatial eigen-mode to each user is
employed at the transmitter. Beamforming vectors on the Grassmann manifold that
depend only on statistical information are to be designed at the transmitter to
maximize the ergodic sum-rate delivered to the two users. Towards this goal,
the beamforming vectors are first fixed and a closed-form expression is
obtained for the ergodic sum-rate in terms of the covariance matrices of the
links. This expression is non-convex in the beamforming vectors ensuring that
the classical Lagrange multiplier technique is not applicable. Despite this
difficulty, the optimal solution to this problem is shown to be the solution to
the maximization of an appropriately-defined average signal-to-interference and
noise ratio (SINR) metric for each user. This solution is the dominant
generalized eigenvector of a pair of positive-definite matrices where the first
matrix is the covariance matrix of the forward link and the second is an
appropriately-designed ""effective"" interference covariance matrix. In this
sense, our work is a generalization of optimal signalling along the dominant
eigen-mode of the transmit covariance matrix in the single-user case. Finally,
the ergodic sum-rate for the general broadcast setting with M antennas at the
transmitter and M-users (each with a single antenna) is obtained in terms of
the covariance matrices of the links and the beamforming vectors.

The z'-K vs K colour-magnitude diagram shows that a significantly higher
fraction of [OII] emitters is seen on the red sequence in the cluster core than
in other environments we define in this paper. It is likely that these red
galaxies are nearly passively evolving galaxies which host [OII] emitting AGNs,
rather than dust-reddened star-forming galaxies. We argue therefore that AGN
feedback may be one of the critical processes to quench star formation in
massive galaxies in high density regions. We also find that the cluster has
experienced high star formation activities at rates comparable to that in the
field at z=1.46. In addition, a mass-metallicity relation exists in the cluster
at z=1.46, which is similar to that of star-forming galaxies in the field at
z~2. These results all suggest that at z~1.5 star formation activity in the
cluster core becomes as high as those in low density environments and there is
apparently not yet a strong environmental dependence, except for the red

this review article we explain that EM algorithm is a natural computational
scheme for learning image templates of object categories where the learning is
not fully supervised. We represent an image template by an active basis model,
which is a linear composition of a selected set of localized, elongated and
oriented wavelet elements that are allowed to slightly perturb their locations
and orientations to account for the deformations of object shapes. The model
can be easily learned when the objects in the training images are of the same
pose, and appear at the same location and scale. This is often called
supervised learning. In the situation where the objects may appear at different
unknown locations, orientations and scales in the training images, we have to
incorporate the unknown locations, orientations and scales as latent variables
into the image generation process, and learn the template by EM-type
algorithms. The E-step imputes the unknown locations, orientations and scales
based on the currently learned template. This step can be considered
self-supervision, which involves using the current template to recognize the
objects in the training images. The M-step then relearns the template based on
the imputed locations, orientations and scales, and this is essentially the
same as supervised learning. So the EM learning process iterates between
recognition and supervised learning. We illustrate this scheme by several
experiments.

composition of these liquid areas. The model is based on uncertain
thermodynamic data and precipitation rates of organic species predicted to be
present in the lakes and seas that are subject to spatial and temporal
variations. Here we explore and discuss the influence of these uncertainties
and variations. The errors and uncertainties relevant to thermodynamic data are
simulated via Monte-Carlo simulations. Global Circulation Models (GCM) are also
employed in order to investigate the possibility of chemical asymmetry between
the south and the north poles, due to differences in precipitation rates. We
find that mole fractions of compounds in the liquid phase have a high
sensitivity to thermodynamic data used as inputs, in particular molar volumes
and enthalpies of vaporization. When we combine all considered uncertainties,
the ranges of obtained mole fractions are rather large (up to ~8500%) but the
distributions of values are narrow. The relative standard deviations remain
between 10% and ~300% depending on the compound considered. Compared to other
sources of uncertainties and variability, deviation caused by surface pressure
variations are clearly negligible, remaining of the order of a few percent up
to ~20%. Moreover no significant difference is found between the composition of
lakes located in north and south poles. Because the theory of regular solutions
employed here is sensitive to thermodynamic data and is not suitable for polar
molecules such as HCN and CH3CN, our work strongly underlines the need for

the homogeneous melting of a superheated crystal. The interaction model used is
an embedded-atom model for Fe developed in previous work, and the melting
process is simulated in the microcanonical $(N, V, E)$ ensemble. We study
periodically repeated systems containing from 96 to 7776 atoms, and the initial
system is always the perfect crystal without free surfaces or other defects.
For each chosen total energy $E$ and number of atoms $N$, we perform several
hundred statistically independent simulations, with each simulation lasting for
between 500 ps and 10 ns, in order to gather statistics for the waiting time
$\tau_{\rm w}$ before melting occurs. We find that the probability distribution
of $\tau_{\rm w}$ is roughly exponential, and that the mean value $<\tau_{\rm

crystal above the superheating limit identified by other researchers. The mean
$<\tau_{\rm w}>$ also depends strongly on system size in a way that we have
quantified. For very small systems of $\sim 100$ atoms, we observe a persistent
alternation between the solid and liquid states, and we explain why this
happens. Our results allow us to draw conclusions about the reliability of the
recently proposed Z method for determining the melting properties of simulated

in the halo followed the constant or flat trend with [Fe/H], ascribed to the
result of explosive nucleosynthesis in type II SNe. The aim of this study is to
try to clarify this situation by measuring the sulphur abundance in a sample of
halo giants using two diagnostics; the S I triplet around 1045 nm and the [S I]
line at 1082 nm. The latter of the two is not believed to be sensitive to
non-LTE effects. We can thereby minimize the uncertainties in the diagnostic
used and estimate the usefulness of the triplet in sulphur determination in
halo K giants. We will also be able to compare our sulphur abundance
differences from the two diagnostics with the expected non-LTE effects in the
1045 nm triplet previously calculated by others. High-resolution near-infrared
spectra of ten K giants were recorded using the spectrometer CRIRES mounted on
VLT. Two standard settings were used; one covering the S I triplet and one
covering the [S I] line. The sulphur abundances were determined individually
with equivalent widths and synthetic spectra for the two diagnostics using
tailored 1D model atmospheres and relying on non-LTE corrections from the
litterature. Effects of convective inhomogeneities in the stellar atmospheres
are investigated. We corroborate the flat trend in the [S/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plot
for halo stars found in other works and cannot find a scatter nor a rise in
[S/Fe] obtained in some other previous studies. We find the sulphur abundances
deduced from the non-LTE corrected triplet somewhat lower than the abundances
from the [S I] line, possibly indicating too large non-LTE corrections.
Considering 3D modeling, however, they might instead be too small. Further we
show that the [S I] line is possible to use as a sulphur diagnostic down to
[Fe/H] = -2.3 in giants.

ergodic and therefore the only constants of motion are functions of the

approaches: by analyzing individually each AGN X-ray spectrum and by
constructing average spectra for different AGN types. From the individual
analysis, we find that there seems to be an anti correlation between the
spectral index and the sources' hard X-ray luminosity, such that the average
photon index for the higher luminosity sources (> 10E44 erg/s) is significantly
flatter than the average for the lower luminosity sources. We also find that
the intrinsic column density distribution agrees with AGN unified schemes,
although a number of exceptions are found (3% of the whole sample), which are
much more common among optically classified type 2 AGN. We also find that the
so-called ""soft-excess"", apart from the intrinsic absorption, constitutes the
principal deviation from a power-law shape in AGN X-ray spectra and it clearly
displays different characteristics, and likely a different origin, for
unabsorbed and absorbed AGN. Regarding the shape of the average spectra, we
find that it is best reproduced by a combination of an unabsorbed (absorbed)
power law, a narrow Fe Kalpha emission line and a small (large) amount of
reflection for unabsorbed (absorbed) sources. We do not significantly detect
any relativistic contribution to the line emission and we compute an upper
limit for its equivalent width (EW) of 230 eV at the 3 sigma confidence level.
Finally, by dividing the type 1 AGN sample into high- and low-luminosity
sources, we marginally detect a decrease in the narrow Fe Kalpha line EW and in
the amount of reflection as the luminosity increases, the ""so-called""
Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect.

computational point of view. In the first part of the chapter, I present a
novel decomposition method by taking both local and global interactions within
the shape domain into account. At the top of the partitioning hierarchy, the
shape gets split into two parts capturing, respectively, the gross structure
and the peripheral structure. The gross structure may be conceived as the least
deformable part of the shape which remains stable under visual transformations.
The peripheral structure includes limbs, protrusions, and boundary texture.
Such a separation is in accord with the behavior of the artists who start with
a gross shape and enrich it with details. The method is particularly
interesting from the computational point of view as it does not resort to any
geometric notions (e.g. curvature, convexity) explicitly. In the second part of
the chapter, I relate the new method to PDE based shape representation schemes.

0.006 M_sun, their effective temperatures to be T_eff(A) = 12840 +/- 120 K and

sin i_A = 14.5 +/- 0.1 km/s and v_B sin i_B = 4.6 +/- 0.1 km/s. These projected
rotational velocities appear to be much lower than the synchronous values. We
show that measurements of the apsidal motion of the system suffer from a
degeneracy between orbital eccentricity and apsidal motion rate. We use our
spectroscopically-measured e = 0.164 +/- 0.001 to break this degeneracy and
measure (d omega_obs / dt) = 0.133 +/- 0.010 deg/yr. Subtracting the
relativistic contribution of (d omega_GR / dt) = 0.0963 +/- 0.0002 deg/yr
yields the contribution due to tidal torques: (d omega_cl / dt) = 0.037 +/-
0.010 deg/yr. This value is much smaller than the rate predicted by stellar
theory, 0.40--0.87 deg/yr. We interpret this as a misalignment between the
orbital axis of the close binary and the rotational axes of its component
stars, which also explains their apparently low rotational velocities. The
observed and predicted apsidal motion rates could be brought into agreement if
the stars were rotating three times faster than synchronous about axes
perpendicular to the orbital axis. Measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect can be used to confirm this interpretation.

population of artificial clusters covering the broad range of parameters
observed in actual clusters, and assume 100\,\ms\ as the low-mass limit for
effective cluster observation. This leads to a simulated ADF, which is compared
to the low-noise Solar neighbourhood ADF. The best match corresponds to a
non-constant SFR presenting two conspicuous excesses for ages $\le9$\,Myr and
between 220-600\,Myr (the local starburst). The average formation rate is
$\bar{SFR}\approx(2500\pm500)\,\mmy$, corresponding to the average surface

consistent with the formation rate inferred from embedded clusters (ECs), but
much lower ($\la16%$) than that implied by field stars. Both the local

also estimate a characteristic lifetime of the surface heterogeneities. Our

Fourier power spectra of 430 selected light curves obtained by CoRoT during
three observation runs. The low-frequency contribution of the stellar
variability is modelled by a ""generalized semi-lorentzian"" profile. An activity
index is derived from the fitted amplitude and width of the semi-lorentzian

enables the determination of the rotation period. In addition, a convective
turnover time is derived from a grid of stellar models, so that a Rossby number
can be estimated. A characteristic lifetime of the phenomena causing the
observed power at low frequency is assessed from the fitted model of the power
spectrum and is compared to the rotation period. Higher values of the
microvariability index are observed among the coolest stars from our sample. 28
light curves show a clear rotational modulation. The estimated Rossby number of
most of the observed stars with a rotational modulation is less than 1. The
activity index decreases with increasing Rossby number. The quality of the

luminosity of ~6x10^6 L_sun for a multi-wavelength spectral line and continuum
study covering wavelengths from the near- and mid-infrared via (sub)mm
wavelength observations to radio data in the cm regime. Results: While the
overall structure of the multi-wavelength continuum data resembles each other
well, there are several intriguing differences. The 24mum emission stemming
largely from small dust grains follows tightly the spatial structure of the cm
emission tracing the ionized free-free emission. Hence warm dust resides in
regions that are spatially associated with the ionized hot gas (~10^4 K) of the
HII regions. Furthermore, we find several evolutionary stages within the same
complexes, ranging from infrared-observable clusters, via deeply embedded
regions associated with active star formation traced by 24\,$\mu$m and cm
emission, to at least one high-mass gas clump devoid of any such signature. The
13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1) spectral line observations reveal a large kinematic
breadth in the entire region with a total velocity range of approximately 90
km/s. While the average virial mass ratio for W31 is close to unity, the line
width analysis indicates large-scale evolutionary differences between the
southern and northern sub-regions (G10.2-0.3 and G10.3-0.1) of the whole W31
complex. The clump mass function - tracing cluster scales and not scales of
individual stars - derived from the 875mum continuum data has a slope of
1.5+-0.3, consistent with previous cloud mass functions.

For both directions of the heat current, parallel and perpendicular to the

revealing that there are no zero-energy quasiparticles in the superconducting

power and unfamiliarity with the early dynamic Monte Carlo papers in the
statistical physics literature. We argue that there was a deeper reason,
namely, that the structure of problems in the statistical mechanics and those
in the standard statistical literature are different. To make the methods
usable in standard Bayesian problems, one had to exploit the power that comes
from the introduction of judiciously chosen auxiliary variables and collective
moves. This paper examines the development in the critical period 1980--1990,
when the ideas of Markov chain simulation from the statistical physics
literature and the latent variable formulation in maximum likelihood
computation (i.e., EM algorithm) came together to spark the widespread
application of MCMC methods in Bayesian computation.

large scales is extremely challenging because of environment-induced
decoherence. Indeed, measurement techniques for demonstrating the quantumness
of multiparticle systems in the presence of losses are difficult to define and,
if not sufficiently accurate, they provide wrong conclusions. We present a Bell
test where one photon of an entangled pair is amplified and then detected by
threshold detectors, whose signals undergo postselection. The amplification is
performed by a classical machine, which produces a fully separable micro-macro
state. However, by adopting such a technique, one can surprisingly observe a
violation of the CHSH inequality. This is due to the fact that ignoring the
detection loophole, opened by the postselection and the system losses, can lead
to misinterpretations, such as claiming the micro-macro entanglement in a setup
where evidently there is not. By using threshold detectors and postselection,
one can only infer the entanglement of the initial pair of photons, so
micro-micro entanglement, as it is further confirmed by the violation of a
non-separability criterion for bipartite systems. How to detect photonic
micro-macro entanglement in the presence of losses with currently available
technology remains an open question.

extension of the identity component of the automorphism group of a hermitian
Hilbert symmetric space. In the present paper we classify the irreducible
semibounded unitary representations of hermitian Lie groups corresponding to
infinite dimensional irreducible symmetric spaces. These groups come in three
essentially different types: those corresponding to negatively curved spaces
(the symmetric Hilbert domains), the unitary groups acting on the duals of
Hilbert domains, such as the restricted Gra\ss{}mannian, and the motion groups

  resonance cavity","19 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamical behavior of a nonlinear micromechanical resonator acting as one
of the mirrors in an optical resonance cavity is investigated. The mechanical
motion is coupled to the optical power circulating inside the cavity both
directly through the radiation pressure and indirectly through heating that
gives rise to a frequency shift in the mechanical resonance and to thermal
deformation. The the energy stored in the optical cavity is assumed to follow
the mirror displacement without any lag. In contrast, a finite thermal
relaxation rate introduces retardation effects into the mechanical equation of
motion through temperature dependent terms. Using standard averaging and
harmonic balance techniques, slow envelope evolution equations are derived. In
the limit of small mechanical vibrations, the micromechanical system can be
described as a nonlinear Duffing-like oscillator. Coupling to the optical
cavity is shown to introduce corrections to the linear dissipation, the
nonlinear dissipation and the nonlinear elastic constants of the
micromechanical mirror. The magnitude and the sign of these corrections depend
on the exact position of the mirror and on the optical power incident on the
cavity. In particular, the effective linear dissipation can become negative,
causing self-sustained mechanical oscillations to occur. The full slow envelope
evolution equations are used to derive the amplitudes and the corresponding
oscillation frequencies of different limit cycles, and the bifurcation behavior
is analyzed in detail. Finally, the theoretical results are compared to
numerical simulations using realistic values of different physical parameters,
showing a very good correspondence.

spontaneously break translational symmetry. The description of chiral symmetry
breaking and translational symmetry breaking can become intertwined. Here, the
focus is on aspects of chiral symmetry breaking and its possible restoration
that are by construction independent of the nature of translational symmetry
breaking---namely spatial averages of chiral order parameters. A system will be
considered to be chirally restored provided all spatially-averaged chiral order
parameters are zero. A critical question is whether chiral restoration in this
sense is possible for phases in which chiral order parameters are locally
non-zero but whose spatial averages all vanish. We show that this is not
possible unless all chirally-invariant observables are spatially uniform. This
result is first derived for Skyrme-type models, which are based on a nonlinear
sigma model and by construction break chiral symmetry on a point-by-point
basis. A no-go theorem for chiral restoration (in the average sense) for all
models of this type is obtained by showing that in these models there exist
chirally symmetric order parameters which cannot be spatially uniform. Next we
show that the no-go theorem applies to large N_c QCD in any phase which has a
non-zero but spatially varying chiral condensate. The theorem is demonstrated
by showing that in a putative chirally-restored phase, the field configuration
can be reduced to that of a nonlinear sigma model.

The cooling and heating functions include photoionization plus Compton heating,
the radiative transport equations are solved, and the mechanical feedback due

considered. In the medium-high mass galaxies the resulting evolution is highly
unsteady. At early times major accretion episodes caused by cooling flows in
the recycled gas produced by stellar evolution trigger AGN flaring: relaxation
instabilities occur so that duty cycles are small enough to account for the
very small fraction of massive ellipticals observed to be in the QSO-phase,
when the accretion luminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity. At low
redshift all models are characterized by smooth, very sub-Eddington mass

signposts or as tracers of the dark-matter content of their host galaxies, but
constitute also good indicators of the main properties of their parent stellar
populations. Yet, so far, the properties of PNe in the optical regions of
galaxies where stellar population gradients can be more extreme have remained
largely unexplored, mainly because the detection of PNe with narrow-band
imaging or slit-less spectroscopy is considerably hampered by a strong stellar
background. Integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) can overcome this limitation, and
here we present a study of the PN population in the nearby compact elliptical
M32. Using SAURON data taken with just two 10-minutes-long pointings we have
doubled the number of known PNe within the effective radius of M32, detecting
PNe five times fainter than previously found in narrow-band images that
collected nearly the same number of photons. Furthermore, by carefully
accounting for the incompleteness of our survey we could conclude, despite
having only 15 sources, that the central PNe population of M32 is consistent
with the generally adopted shape for the PNe Luminosity Function and its
typical normalization observed in early-type galaxies. Finally, owing to the
proximity of M32 and to UV images taken with HST, we could identify the most
likely candidates for the central star of a subset of our detected PNe and
conclude that these stars are affected by substantial amounts of circumstellar
dust extinction, a finding that could reconcile the intriguing discrepancy
previously reported in M32 between model predictions and observations for the
later stages of stellar evolution. Considering the modest time investment on a
4m-class telescope that delivered these results, this work illustrates the
potential of future IFS studies for the central PNe population of early-type
galaxies.

actual tree geometry, a 20-yr-old walnut tree (Juglans Regia L.) and comparison
with simple models, we analyze the influence of geometrical and physical
parameters on the occurrence of branch breakage and on the successive breaking
events occurring in a tree-like structure when the flow velocity is increased.
We show that both the branching pattern and the slenderness exponent, defining
the branch taper, play a major role in the breakage scenario. We identify a
criterion for branch breakage to occur before breakage of the trunk. In that
case, we show that the successive breakage of peripheral branches allows the
plant to sustain higher flow forces. This mechanism is therefore similar to
elastic reconfiguration, and can be seen as a second strategy to overcome
critical events, possibly a widespread solution in plants and benthic
organisms.
