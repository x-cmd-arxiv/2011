  Conditions",,,,,"math.PR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Foster-Lyapunov theorem and its variants serve as the primary tools for
studying the stability of queueing systems. In addition, it is well known that
setting the drift of the Lyapunov function equal to zero in steady-state
provides bounds on the expected queue lengths. However, such bounds are often
very loose due to the fact that they fail to capture resource pooling effects.
The main contribution of this paper is to show that the approach of ""setting
the drift of a Lyapunov function equal to zero"" can be used to obtain bounds on
the steady-state queue lengths which are tight in the heavy-traffic limit. The
key is to establish an appropriate notion of state-space collapse in terms of
steady-state moments of weighted queue length differences, and use this
state-space collapse result when setting the Lyapunov drift equal to zero. As
an application of the methodology, we prove the steady-state equivalent of the
heavy-traffic optimality result of Stolyar for wireless networks operating
under the MaxWeight scheduling policy.

phenomena that are characterized by a waveguide-like propagation along the

Waveguide pass-bands and attenuation factors are obtained analytically, while
transient processes developed under the action of a monochromatic local source

particularities of transient waves in cases where steady-state solutions are
absent: resonant waves with frequencies demarcating pass- and stop-bands at the

they are sensitive to the trilinear soft breaking parameter $(A_0)$ and low
values of the parameter tan$\beta$ in the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model.
A large region of this mSUGRA parameter space within the reach of the ongoing
experiments at the LHC is disfavoured by the bound on the lightest Higgs boson
mass ($m_h \ge 114.4 $ GeV) unless $A_0$ has moderate to large negative values.
Interestingly this parameter space with $A_0 \ne 0$ is also consistent with the
observed dark matter relic density. A natural consequence of large $A_0$ is the
existence of a light top squark ($\lstop$). The proposed signals primarily stem
from direct $\lstop \lstop^*$ production and/or $\tilde g \ra \tilde t_{1} t $,
if all squark-gluino events are considered. A thorough analysis of the signals

Capella is among the few binary stars with two evolved giant
components. The hotter component is a chromospherically active star within the
Hertzsprung gap, while the cooler star is possibly helium-core burning. Aims.
The known inclination of the orbital plane from astrometry in combination with
precise radial velocities will allow very accurate masses to be determined for
the individual Capella stars. This will constrain their evolutionary stage and
possibly the role of the active star's magnetic field on the dynamical
evolution of the binary system. Methods. We obtained a total of 438
high-resolution \'echelle spectra during the years 2007-2010 and used the
measured velocities to recompute the orbital elements. Our double-lined orbital
solution yields average residuals of 64 m/s for the cool component and 297 m/s
for the more rapidly rotating hotter component. Results. The semi-amplitude of
the cool component is smaller by 0.045 km/s than the orbit determination of
Torres et al. from data taken during 1996-1999 but more precise by a factor of
5.5, while for the hotter component it is larger by 0.580 km/s and more precise
by a factor of 3.6. This corresponds to masses of 2.573\pm0.009 M_sun and
2.488\pm0.008 M_sun for the cool and hot component, respectively. Their
relative errors of 0.34% and 0.30% are about half of the values given in Torres
et al. for a combined literature- data solution but with absolute values
different by 4% and 2% for the two components, respectively. The mass ratio of
the system is therefore q = M_A/M_B = 0.9673 \pm 0.0020. Conclusions. Our orbit
is the most precise and also likely to be the most accurate ever obtained for
Capella.

disappearance. The MINOS experiment has taken data with an accelerator beam
optimized for muon antineutrino production, accumulating an exposure of
$1.71\times 10^{20}$ protons on target. In the Far Detector, 97 charged current
muon antineutrino events are observed. The no-oscillation hypothesis predicts
156 events and is excluded at $6.3\sigma$. The best fit to oscillation yields
$\Delta
\bar{m}^{2}=(3.36^{+0.46}_{-0.40}\textrm{(stat.)}\pm0.06\textrm{(syst.)})\times
10^{-3}\,\eV^{2}$,
$\sin^{2}(2\bar{\theta})=0.86^{+0.11}_{-0.12}\textrm{(stat.)}\pm0.01\textrm{(syst.)}$.
The MINOS muon neutrino and muon antineutrino measurements are consistent at
the 2.0% confidence level, assuming identical underlying oscillation
parameters.

queue served by many parallel servers. The queue is served in the

the system without service. Two diffusion models are proposed in this paper.
They differ in how the patience time distribution is built into them. The first
diffusion model uses the patience time density at zero and the second one uses
the entire patience time distribution. To analyze these diffusion models, we
develop a numerical algorithm for computing the stationary distribution of such
a diffusion process. A crucial part of the algorithm is to choose an
appropriate reference density. Using a conjecture on the tail behavior of a
limit queue length process, we propose a systematic approach to constructing a
reference density. With the proposed reference density, the algorithm is shown
to converge quickly in numerical experiments. These experiments also show that
the diffusion models are good approximations for many-server queues, sometimes
for queues with as few as twenty servers.

unconstrained optimization published in 1965, is designed to minimize a
scalar-valued function f of n real variables using only function values,
without any derivative information. Each Nelder-Mead iteration is associated
with a nondegenerate simplex defined by n+1 vertices and their function values;
a typical iteration produces a new simplex by replacing the worst vertex by a
new point. Despite the method's widespread use, theoretical results have been
limited: for strictly convex objective functions of one variable with bounded
level sets, the algorithm always converges to the minimizer; for such functions
of two variables, the diameter of the simplex converges to zero, but examples
constructed by McKinnon show that the algorithm may converge to a nonminimizing
point.
  This paper considers the restricted Nelder-Mead algorithm, a variant that
does not allow expansion steps. In two dimensions we show that, for any
nondegenerate starting simplex and any twice-continuously differentiable
function with positive definite Hessian and bounded level sets, the algorithm
always converges to the minimizer. The proof is based on treating the method as
a discrete dynamical system, and relies on several techniques that are
non-standard in convergence proofs for unconstrained optimization.

solutions to a particular Voigt-regularization of the three-dimensional

coupling of a resistive magnetic field to the Euler-Voigt model is introduced
to form an inviscid regularization of the inviscid resistive MHD system. The
results hold in both the whole space $\nR^3$ and in the context of periodic
boundary conditions. Weak solutions for this regularized model are also
considered, and proven to exist globally in time, but the question of
uniqueness for weak solutions is still open. Since the main purpose of this
line of research is to introduce a reliable and stable inviscid numerical
regularization of the underlying model we, in particular, show that the
solutions of the Voigt regularized system converge, as the regularization
parameter $\alpha\maps0$, to strong solutions of the original inviscid
resistive MHD, on the corresponding time interval of existence of the latter.
Moreover, we also establish a new criterion for blow-up of solutions to the
original MHD system inspired by this Voigt regularization. This type of
regularization, and the corresponding results, are valid for, and can also be
applied to, a wide class of hydrodynamic models.

high influx but low growth rates, a quasi-static phase with low influx and low
growth rates, and a death phase with negative growth rate. A mean field model
well explains the transition among these phases as bifurcations. The

either converges to 1/2 as $n$ grows without bound, or it may have a
non-vanishing, oscillatory, (quasi-) periodic pattern around the value 1/2 for
all large $n$. In this paper, we make an attempt to shed some insight into this
erratic behavior of $R_n$, by drawing an analogy with the realm of physics of
wave propagation, in particular, the elementary theory of scattering and
diffraction. It turns out that there are two types of behavior of wave
diffraction patterns formed by crystals, which are correspondingly analogous to
the two types of patterns of $R_n$. When the crystal is perfect, the
diffraction intensity spectrum exhibits very sharp peaks, a.k.a. Bragg peaks,
at wavelengths of full constructive interference. These wavelengths correspond
to the frequencies of the harmonic waves of the oscillatory mode of $R_n$. On
the other hand, when the crystal is imperfect and there is a considerable
degree of disorder in its structure, the Bragg peaks disappear, and the
behavior of this mode is analogous to the one where $R_n$ is convergent.

an accreted crust is therefore larger, by DR(M), than for usually considered

nuclei, we calculate, within the one-component plasma approximation, the EOSs
corresponding to different nuclear compositions of ashes of X-ray bursts in
LMXB. These EOSs are then applied for studying the effect of different
formation scenarios on the neutron-star mass-radius relation. Assuming the SLy
EOS for neutron star's liquid core, derived by Douchin & Haensel (2001), we
find that at M=1.4 M_sun the star with accreted crust has a radius more than
100 m larger that for the crust of catalyzed matter. Using smallness of the
crust mass compared to M, we derive a formula that relates DR(M) to the
difference in the crust EOS. This very precise formula gives also analytic
dependence of DR on M and R of the reference star built of catalyzed matter.
The formula is valid for any EOS of the liquid core. Rotation of neutron star
makes DR(M) larger. We derive an approximate but very precise formula that

mass, using the ""MPA"" and ""Durham"" semi-analytic models, implemented on the
Millennium Run simulation. The results from both models are similar. We find
that about 45% of the stellar mass in central galaxies in present-day halos
less massive than ~10^{12} Msun/h is already in place at z~1. This fraction
increases to ~65% for more massive halos. The peak of star formation efficiency
shifts toward lower mass halos from z~1 to z~0. The stellar mass in low-mass
halos grows mostly by star formation since z~1, while in high-mass halos most
of the stellar mass is assembled by mergers. These trends are clear indications
of ""halo downsizing"". We compare our findings to the results of the
phenomenological method developed by Zheng, Coil & Zehavi (2007). The
theoretical predictions are in qualitative agreement with these results,
however there are large discrepancies. The most significant one concerns the
amount of stars already in place in the progenitor galaxies at z~1, which is
about a factor of two larger in both semi-analytic models. We also use the
semi-analytic catalogs to test different assumptions made in that work, and
illustrate the importance of smooth accretion of dark matter when estimating
the mergers contribution. We demonstrate that methods studying galaxy evolution
from the galaxy-halo connection are powerful in constraining theoretical models
and can guide future efforts of modeling galaxy evolution. Conversely,
semi-analytic models serve an important role in improving such methods.

Wilf and D. Zeilberger and find some hypergeometric functions in two variables
which are second components of WZ-pairs that can be certified using
Zeilberger's EKHAD package. These certificates have an additional property
which allows us to get generalized Ramanujan-type series which are routinely
proven by computer. We call these second hypergeometric components of the
WZ-pairs generators. Finding generators seems a hard task but using a kind of
experimental research (explained below), we have succeeded in finding some of
them. Unfortunately we have not found yet generators for the most impressive
Ramanujan's formulas. We also prove some interesting binomial sums for the
constant $1/\pi^2$. Finally we rewrite many of the obtained series using
pochhammer symbols and study the rate of convergence.

component that drifts with respect to the proton component. The neutron-proton
collisions strongly heat the jet and generate electron-positron pairs. We
investigate radiation produced by this heating using a new numerical code. Our
results confirm the recent claim that collisional heating generates the
observed Band-type spectrum of GRBs. We extend the model to study the effects
of magnetic fields on the emitted spectrum. We find that the spectrum peak
remains near 1 MeV for the entire range of the magnetization parameter
$0<\epsilon_B<2$ that is explored in our simulations. The low-energy part of
the spectrum softens with increasing $\epsilon_B$, and a visible soft excess
appears in the keV band. The high-energy part of the spectrum extends well
above the GeV range and can contribute to the prompt emission observed by
Fermi/LAT. Overall, the radiation spectrum created by the collisional mechanism
appears to agree with observations, with no fine-tuning of parameters.

are randomly divided into two parts, the training set and the probe set. We
argue that this straightforward and standard method may lead to terrible bias,
since in real biological and information networks, missing links are more
likely to be links connecting low-degree nodes. We therefore study how to
uncover missing links with low-degree nodes, namely links in the probe set are
of lower degree products than a random sampling. Experimental analysis on ten
local similarity indices and four disparate real networks reveals a surprising
result that the Leicht-Holme-Newman index [E. A. Leicht, P. Holme, and M. E. J.
Newman, Phys. Rev. E 73, 026120 (2006)] performs the best, although it was
known to be one of the worst indices if the probe set is a random sampling of
all links. We further propose an parameter-dependent index, which considerably
improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, we show the relevance of the
proposed index on three real sampling methods.
