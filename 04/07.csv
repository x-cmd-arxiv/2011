galaxy up-to-date, by using the largest number of spectroscopic points sampled
in the galaxy, and by comparing the statistical significance of different
strong-line metallicity indicators. We find features not previously reported
for this galaxy that imply a multi-modality of the abundance gradient
consistent with a nearly flat-distribution in the innermost regions of the
galaxy, a steep negative gradient along the disc and a shallow gradient or
nearly-constant metallicity beyond the optical edge of the galaxy. The N/O
ratio seems to follow the same radial behaviour. We demonstrate that the
observed dispersion in metallicity shows no systematic dependence with the
spatial position, signal-to-noise or ionization conditions, implying that the
scatter in abundance for a given radius is reflecting a true spatial physical
variation of the oxygen content. Furthermore, by exploiting the 2D IFS data, we
were able to construct the 2D metallicity structure of the galaxy, detecting
regions of metal enhancement, and showing that they vary depending on the
choice of the metallicity estimator. The analysis of axisymmetric variations in
the disc of NGC 628 suggest that the physical conditions and the star formation
history of different-symmetric regions of the galaxy have evolved in a

primordial non-Gaussianity. The current quality of data, however, forces the
statistical analysis to probe a region of parameter space -- the extreme tail
of the mass function -- which is neither accessible in any of the currently
available theoretical prescriptions for calculating the mass function, nor
calibrated in N-body simulations. In this work we present a new analytical
prescription for calculating a ""resummed"" non-Gaussian halo mass function,
which is constructed to remain stable in the extreme tail. We show that the
prescription works well in the parameter regime that has been currently
explored in simulations. We then use Fisher matrix techniques to compare our
prescription with an extrapolated fit to N-body simulations, which has recently
been used to obtain constraints from data collected by the South Pole Telecope.
We show that for the current data, both prescriptions would lead to
statistically consistent constraints. As the data improve, however, there is a
possibility of introducing a statistically significant bias in the constraints
due to the choice of prescription, especially if non-Gaussianity is scale
dependent and becomes relatively large on cluster scales. It would then be
necessary to test the accuracy of the prescriptions in N-body simulations that
can probe clusters with high masses and redshifts in the presence of large
non-Gaussianity.

reconfiguration from one constriction size to another is known to occur by
apparently random discrete atomic displacements, results reveal a remarkable
simplicity - the magnitude of discrete atomic displacements is limited to a
small set of values that correspond to elementary slip distances in gold rather
than Au-Au inter-atomic distance. Combined with measurements of spring constant
of constrictions, results reveal two fundamental crossovers in deformation
modes with increasing contact diameter - first, from homogeneous shear to
defect mediated deformation at a diameter that is in close agreement with
previous predictions (Sorensen et al., Phys. Rev. B 57, 3283 (1998)]; second,
the discovery of another crossover marking surface to volume dominated
deformation. A remarkable modulus enhancement is observed when the size of the
constrictions approaches the Fermi wavelength of the electrons, and in the

However, the ferromagnetic state is unstable against formation of a

specific rotations which result in the codewords having equidistant

maximum modulation diversity with a low-complexity minimum distance decoder and

because their implementation can be distributed through the network. However,
their convergence rates are typically very slow. This paper introduces a family
of dual descent algorithms that use approximate Newton directions to accelerate
the convergence rate of conventional dual descent. These approximate directions
can be computed using local information exchanges thereby retaining the
benefits of distributed implementations. The approximate Newton directions are
obtained through matrix splitting techniques and sparse Taylor approximations
of the inverse Hessian.We show that, similarly to conventional Newton methods,
the proposed algorithm exhibits superlinear convergence within a neighborhood
of the optimal value. Numerical analysis corroborates that convergence times
are between one to two orders of magnitude faster than existing distributed
optimization methods. A connection with recent developments that use consensus
iterations to compute approximate Newton directions is also presented.

0.17. In the overdoped regime of $x > 0.15$ we found both semiclassical
angle-dependent magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) and Shubnikov-de Haas

appearance of fast SdH oscillations in strongly overdoped samples is caused by
magnetic breakdown. This observation provides clear evidence for a
reconstructed multiply-connected Fermi surface up to the very end of the
overdoped regime at $x\simeq 0.17$. The strength of the superlattice potential
responsible for the reconstructed Fermi surface is found to decrease with
increasing doping level and likely vanishes at the same carrier concentration

symmetry breaking and superconducting pairing. A detailed analysis of the

consistent if the absorption due to methane is reduced. Clouds can also render
such an atmosphere consistent with our observations, but only if they lie

measure the matter power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy. In order to
fully exploit these observations, models are needed that, given a set of
cosmological parameters, can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum at
the level of 1% or better for scales corresponding to comoving wave numbers
0.1<k<10 h/Mpc. We have employed the large suite of simulations from the OWLS
project to investigate the effects of various baryonic processes on the matter
power spectrum. In addition, we have examined the distribution of power over
different mass components, the back-reaction of the baryons on the CDM, and the
evolution of the dominant effects on the matter power spectrum. We find that
single baryonic processes are capable of changing the power spectrum by up to
several tens of per cent. Our simulation that includes AGN feedback, which we
consider to be our most realistic simulation as, unlike those used in previous
studies, it has been shown to solve the overcooling problem and to reproduce
optical and X-ray observations of groups of galaxies, predicts a decrease in
power relative to a dark matter only simulation ranging, at z=0, from 1% at
k~0.3 h/Mpc to 10% at k~1 h/Mpc and to 30% at k~10 h/Mpc. This contradicts the

effect only for k>70 h/Mpc. Therefore, baryons, and particularly AGN feedback,
cannot be ignored in theoretical power spectra for k>0.3 h/Mpc. It will thus be
necessary to improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxy
formation, or at least to constrain them through auxiliary observations, before
we can fulfil the goals of upcoming weak lensing surveys.

detailed study of the kinematics of the galaxies within 60 kpc of the radio
core and we link this to the kinematics of the protocluster on the megaparsec
scale. Identification of optical emission lines shows that 11 galaxies are at
the redshift of the protocluster. The density of line emitters is more than an
order of magnitude higher in the core of the protocluster than the larger scale
environment. This implies a matter overdensity in the core of delta_m~70 which
is similar to the outskirts of local galaxy clusters. The velocity distribution
of the confirmed satellite galaxies shows a broad, double-peaked velocity
structure with sigma=1360+/-206 km/s. A similar broad, double-peaked
distribution was found in a previous study targeting the large scale
protocluster structure, indicating that a common process is acting on both
small and large scales. Including all spectroscopically confirmed protocluster
galaxies, a velocity dispersion of 1013+/-87 km/s is found. We show that the
protocluster has likely decoupled from the Hubble flow and is a dynamically
evolved structure. Comparison to the Millenium simulation indicates that the
protocluster velocity distribution is consistent with that of the most massive
haloes at z~2, but we rule out that the protocluster is a fully virialized
structure based on dynamical arguments and its X-ray luminosity. Comparison to
merging haloes in the Millennium simulation shows that the structure as
observed in and around the Spiderweb galaxy is best interpreted as being the
result of a merger between two massive haloes. We propose that this merger can
result in an increase in star formation and AGN activity in the protocluster
core and is possibly an important stage in the evolution of massive cD
galaxies.

apply a variety of Halo Occupation Distributions (HODs) and produce biased mass
tracers to mimic different galaxy populations. We investigate whether galaxy
bias changes the non-linear shifts on the acoustic scale relative to the
underlying dark matter distribution presented by Seo et al (2009). For the less
biased HOD models (b < 3), we do not detect any shift in the acoustic scale
relative to the no-bias case, typically 0.10% \pm 0.10%. However, the most
biased HOD models (b > 3) show a shift at moderate significance (0.79% \pm
0.31% for the most extreme case). We test the one-step reconstruction technique
introduced by Eisenstein et al. (2007) in the case of realistic galaxy bias and
shot noise. The reconstruction scheme increases the correlation between the
initial and final (z = 1) density fields achieving an equivalent level of
correlation at nearly twice the wavenumber after reconstruction. Reconstruction
reduces the shifts and errors on the shifts. We find that after reconstruction
the shifts from the galaxy cases and the dark matter case are consistent with
each other and with no shift. The 1-sigma systematic errors on the distance

non-radially pulsating white dwarf and an unusually small sub-stellar
secondary. The system has a high space velocity and a very short orbital period
of about 67 minutes, well below the usual minimum period for CVs. To explain
the existence of this peculiar system, two theories have been proposed. One
suggests that SDSS J1507+52 was formed from a detached white-dwarf/brown-dwarf
binary. The other theory proposes that the system is a member of the Galactic
halo-population.
  Here, we present ultraviolet spectroscopy of SDSS J1507+52 obtained with the
Hubble Space Telescope with the aim of distinguishing between these two
theories. The UV flux of the system is dominated by emission from the accreting
white dwarf. Fits to model stellar atmospheres yield physical parameter
estimates of T(eff) = 14200 \pm 500 K, log(g)=8.2 \pm 0.3, vsin(i)=180 \pm 20
kms-1 and [Fe/H]=-1.2 \pm 0.2. These fits suggest a distance towards SDSS
J1507+52 of d = 250 \pm 50 pc. The quoted uncertainties include systematic
errors associated with the adopted fitting windows and interstellar reddening.
Assuming that there is no contribution to the UV flux from a hot, optically
thick boundary layer, we find a T(eff) much higher than previously estimated
from eclipse analysis. The strongly sub-solar metallicity we infer for SDSS
J1507+52 is consistent with that of halo stars at the same space velocity. We
therefore conclude that SDSS J1507+52 is a member of the Galactic halo.

sufficiently close to the equilibrium solution; moreover an additional
condition on the coeffcients is imposed. In the corotational case, we only
assume that the initial probability density is sufficiently close to the

this paper, we study the possible application of a nuclear density functional

deduce the interaction between nucleons to find a rough estimate of the charge
radius of the specific nuclei. Compared to the Finite-Range Thomas Fermi model,
we include three-body forces, which might be important at densities several
times that of nuclear matter density. We also add the momentum dependent
interaction to take into account the effective mass of the nucleons. We study
matter in the neutron star crust using the Wigner-Seitz cell method. By
constructing the mass-radius relation of neutron stars and investigating
lepton-rich nuclear matter in proto-neutron stars, we find that the density
functional can be used to construct an equation of state of hot dense matter.

description of the structure of atomic nuclei. While mean-field calculations
provide detailed information on the nuclear shell structure for a wide range of
nuclei, they do not capture the complete structure of nuclei, in particular the
impact of small, dense structures in nuclei. The strong, short-range component
of the nucleon-nucleon potential yields hard interactions between nucleons
which are close together, generating a high-momentum tail to the nucleon
momentum distribution, with momenta well in excess of the Fermi momentum. This
high-momentum component of the nuclear wave-function is one of the most poorly
understood parts of nuclear structure.
  Utilizing high-energy probes, we can isolate scattering from high-momentum
nucleons, and use these measurements to examine the structure and impact of
short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations. Over the last decade we have moved
from looking for evidence of such short-range structures to mapping out their
strength in nuclei and examining their isospin structure. This has been made
possible by high-luminosity and high-energy accelerators, coupled with an
improved understanding of the reaction mechanism issues involved in studying
these structures. We review the general issues related to short-range
correlations, survey recent experiments aimed at probing these short-range
structures, and lay out future possibilities to further these studies.

have unveiled the presence of luminous GeV gamma-ray emission in middle-aged
SNRs, providing a new insight into the shock-acceleration theory and the origin
of galactic cosmic rays. The middle-aged SNRs detected by the Fermi LAT are
generally much brighter in GeV than in TeV in terms of energy flux, which
emphasizes the importance of the GeV observations. Spectral steepening in the
Fermi-LAT band is commonly found for the GeV-luminous SNRs. Remarkably, most
(if not all) of them are known to be interacting with molecular clouds, and
they are also the strong sources of synchrotron radio emission. We discuss
possible scenarios to explain the enhanced GeV gamma-ray emission in the

which was the only information available for decades. In 2010, while the

first localization of GRB sources, our understanding of this crucial phase of
GRBs has made great progress. We discuss some recent advances in this field,
like the occasional detection of the prompt emission at all wavelengths, from
optical to GeV; the existence of sub-luminous GRBs; the attempts to standardize
GRBs; and the possible detection of polarization in two very bright GRBs.
Despite these advances, tantalizing observational and theoretical challenges
still exist, concerning the detection of the faintest GRBs, the panchromatic
observation of GRBs from their very beginning, the origin of the prompt
emission, or the understanding of the physics at work during this phase.
Significant progress on this last topic is expected with SVOM thanks to the
observation of dozens of GRBs from optical to MeV during the burst itself, and
the measure of the redshift for the majority of them. SVOM will also change our
view of the prompt GRB phase in another way. Within a few years, the
sensitivity of sky surveys at optical and radio frequencies, and outside the
electromagnetic domain in gravitational waves or neutrinos, will allow them to
detect several new types of transient signals, and SVOM will be uniquely suited
to identify which of these transients are associated with GRBs. This radically
novel look at GRBs may elucidate the complex physics producing these bright
flashes.

  1.8",,,,"math.DG math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider smooth, properly immersed hypersurfaces evolving
by mean curvature in some open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ on a time interval
$(0, t_0)$. We prove that $p$ - integrability with $p\ge 2$ for the second
fundamental form of these hypersurfaces in some space-time region $B_R(y)\times
(0, t_0)$ implies that the $\mathcal{H}^{n+2-p}$ - measure of the first
singular set vanishes inside $B_R(y)$. For $p=2$, this was established
independently by Han and Sun. Our result furthermore generalizes previous work
of Xu, Ye and Zhao and of Le and Sesum for $p\ge n+2$, in which case the
singular set was shown to be empty. By a theorem of Ilmanen, our integrability
condition is satisfied for $p=2$ and $n=2\,$ if the initial surface has finite
genus. Thus, the first singular set has zero $\mathcal{H}^2$- measure in this
case. This is the conclusion of Brakke's main regularity theorem for the
special case of surfaces, but derived without having to impose the area
continuity and unit density hypothesis. It follows from recent work of Head and
of Huisken and Sinestrari that for the flow of closed, $k$ - convex
hypersurfaces, that is hypersurfaces whose sum of the smallest $k$ principal
curvatures is positive, our integrability criterion holds with exponent
$p=n+3-k-\alpha$ for all small $\alpha >0$ as long as $1\le k\le n-1$.
Therefore, the first singular set of such solutions is at most $(k-1)$ -
dimensional, which is an optimal estimate in view of some explicit examples.

source is contaminated with Gaussian noise, a linear estimator minimizes the
mean square estimation error. This paper analyzes, more generally, the
conditions for linearity of optimal estimators. Given a noise (or source)
distribution, and a specified signal to noise ratio (SNR), we derive conditions
for existence and uniqueness of a source (or noise) distribution for which the
$L_p$ optimal estimator is linear. We then show that, if the noise and source
variances are equal, then the matching source must be distributed identically
to the noise. Moreover, we prove that the Gaussian source-channel pair is
unique in the sense that it is the only source-channel pair for which the mean
square error (MSE) optimal estimator is linear at more than one SNR values.
Further, we show the asymptotic linearity of MSE optimal estimators for low SNR
if the channel is Gaussian regardless of the source and, vice versa, for high
SNR if the source is Gaussian regardless of the channel. The extension to the
vector case is also considered where besides the conditions inherited from the
scalar case, additional constraints must be satisfied to ensure linearity of
the optimal estimator.

of the collapse of massive star forming clouds using the ORION code. These
simulations are the first to include the feedback effects protostellar
outflows, as well as protostellar radiative heating and radiation pressure
exerted on the infalling, dusty gas. We find that that outflows evacuate polar
cavities of reduced optical depth through the ambient core. These enhance the
radiative flux in the poleward direction so that it is 1.7 to 15 times larger
than that in the midplane. As a result the radiative heating and outward
radiation force exerted on the protostellar disk and infalling cloud gas in the
equatorial direction are greatly diminished. The simultaneously reduces the
Eddington radiation pressure barrier to high-mass star formation and increases
the minimum threshold surface density for radiative heating to suppress
fragmentation compared to models that do not include outflows. The strength of
both these effects depends on the initial core surface density. Lower surface
density cores have longer free-fall times and thus massive stars formed within
them undergo more Kelvin contraction as the core collapses, leading to more
powerful outflows. Furthermore, in lower surface density clouds the ratio of
the time required for the outflow to break out of the core to the core
free-fall time is smaller, so that these clouds are consequently influenced by
outflows at earlier stages of collapse. As a result, outflow effects are
strongest in low surface density cores and weakest in high surface density one.
We also find that radiation focusing in the direction of outflow cavities is
sufficient to prevent the formation of radiation pressure-supported
circumstellar gas bubbles, in contrast to models which neglect protostellar
outflow feedback.

proving that this translation-like action can be chosen to be transitive when
the acting free group is finitely generated. We furthermore prove that the
geometric version of Burnside's Problem holds true. That is, every finitely
generated infinite group admits a translation-like action by $\Z$. This answers
a question posed by Whyte. In pursuit of these results we discover an
interesting property of Cayley graphs: every finitely generated infinite group

tree can be chosen to have degree 2 (and hence be a bi-infinite Hamiltonian
path) if and only if $G$ has finitely many ends, and it can be chosen to have
any degree greater than 2 if and only if $G$ is non-amenable. We use this last
result to then study tilings of groups. We define a general notion of

employ the isotropic $\gamma$-ray data from Fermi-LAT to constrain the model

such a case, the annihilation cross section of the supersymmetric dark matter
can be constrained to the thermal production level, and the leptonic dark
matter model which is proposed to explain the positron/electron excesses can be
well excluded. Conversely, if the positron/electron excesses are of a dark

state-of-the-art method. We characterize the proposed methods in the context of
the other compared methods and show that, coupled with motif subtype
identification, the proposed methods can be effectively applied to a wide range
of transcription factors. Finally, we argue that the proposed methods are

209, AS 205 and V4046 Sgr - which complement the six sources in the Taurus star
forming region reported previously. CO 2-1 and HCO+ 3-2 emission are detected
and resolved in all disks and show velocity patterns consistent with Keplerian
rotation. Where detected, the emission from DCO+ 3-2, N2H+ 3-2, H2CO 3-2 and
4-3,HCN 3-2 and CN 2-1 are also generally spatially resolved. The detection
rates are highest toward the M and K stars, while the F star SAO 206462 has
only weak CN and HCN emission, and H2CO alone is detected toward HD 142527.
These findings together with the statistics from the previous Taurus disks,
support the hypothesis that high detection rates of many small molecules depend
on the presence of a cold and protected disk midplane, which is less common
around F and A stars compared to M and K stars. Disk-averaged variations in the
proposed radiation tracer CN/HCN are found to be small, despite two orders of
magnitude range of spectral types and accretion rates. In contrast, the
resolved images suggest that the CN/HCN emission ratio varies with disk radius
in at least two of the systems. There are no clear observational differences in
the disk chemistry between the classical/full T Tauri disks and transitional
disks. Furthermore, the observed line emission does not depend on measured
accretion luminosities or the number of infrared lines detected, which suggests
that the chemistry outside of 100 AU is not coupled to the physical processes
that drive the chemistry in the innermost few AU.

two nearly equal mass (1:1.45 and 1:1.25) companions are likely to merge with
their host BCGs in 0.35 Gyr in major, dry mergers. We conclude that some BCGs
continue to grow from major merging even at z~0. We analyse the stellar
kinematics of these systems using the \lambda_R parameter developed by the
SAURON team. This offers a new and unique means to measure the stellar angular
momentum of BCGs and make a direct comparison to other early-type galaxies. The
BCGs and their companions have similar ellipticities to those of other
early-type galaxies but are more massive. We find that not all these massive

two massive companions are found to be fast-rotating galaxies with high angular

using a momentum-space approach. The long-distance interaction is mediated by
Goldstone magnons, whose interaction is expressed in terms of the electron
Green's functions. There is also a Higgs mode, whose excitation energy can be
calculated. The case of fast magnons obeying linear dispersion relation in
three spatial dimensions admits nonperturbative treatment using the Gribov
equation, and the solution exhibits singular behaviour which has an
interpretation as a tower of spin-1 electronic excitations. This occurs near
the Mott insulator state. The electrons are more free in the case of slow
magnons, where the perturbative corrections are less singular at the
thresholds. We then turn our attention to the problem of high-Tc
superconductivity, through the discussion of the stability of the
antiferromagnetic ground state in two spatial dimensions. We argue that this is
caused by an effective mixing of the Goldstone and Higgs modes, which in turn
is caused by an effective Goldstone-boson condensation. The instability of the
antiferromagnetic system is analyzed by studying the non-perturbative behaviour
of the Higgs boson self-energy using the Dyson-Schwinger equations.

connection to dynamical chaos is of great scientific interest. In this work,
using information geometric (IG) techniques, we investigate the effects of
micro-correlations on the evolution of maximal probability paths on statistical
manifolds induced by systems whose microscopic degrees of freedom are Gaussian
distributed. We use the statistical manifolds associated with correlated and
non-correlated Gaussians to model the scattering induced quantum entanglement
of two spinless, structureless, non-relativistic particles, the latter
represented by minimum uncertainty Gaussian wave-packets. Knowing that the
degree of entanglement is quantified by the purity P of the system, we express
the purity for s-wave scattering in terms of the micro-correlation coefficient
r - a quantity that parameterizes the correlated microscopic degrees of freedom
of the system; thus establishing a connection between entanglement and
micro-correlations. Moreover, the correlation coefficient r is readily
expressed in terms of physical quantities involved in the scattering, the
precise form of which is obtained via our IG approach. It is found that the
entanglement duration can be controlled by the initial momentum p_{o}, momentum
spread {\sigma}_{o} and r. Furthermore, we obtain exact expressions for the IG
analogue of standard indicators of chaos such as the sectional curvatures,
Jacobi field intensities and the Lyapunov exponents. We then present an
analytical estimate of the information geometric entropy (IGE); a suitable
measure that quantifies the complexity of geodesic paths on curved manifolds.
Finally, we present concluding remarks addressing the usefulness of an IG
characterization of both entanglement and complexity in quantum physics.

assures that the turbulence has time to settle down to a homogeneous shear-free

turbulence with the same integral scale, so that a direct comparison could be
made between the different flows. Our primary finding is that the behavior of
the turbulence behind our multi-scale grids is virtually identical to that
behind the equivalent conventional grid. In particular, all flows exhibit a
power-law decay of energy, $u^2 \sim t^{-n}$, where $n$ is very close to the
classical Saffman exponent of $n = 6/5$. Moreover, all spectra exhibit
classical Kolmogorov scaling, with the spectra collapsing on the integral

a lack of any evidence of variability with the orbital period of the binary

aim to explain the gamma-ray observations and predict the behaviour of the

terms of the specific models are compared with the observations of Eta Carinae,
and the neutrino spectra produced in hadronic models are confronted with the
atmospheric neutrino background and the sensitivity of 1 km$^2$ neutrino
telescope. We show that spectral features can be explained in terms of the
stellar wind collision model between the winds of the companion stars in which
the acceleration of particles occurs on both sides of the double shock
structure. The shocks from the Eta Carinae star and the companion star can
accelerate particles to different energies depending on the different
conditions determined by the parameters of the stars. The lack of strong GeV
gamma-ray variability with the period of the binary system can be also
understood in terms of such a model. We predict that the gamma-ray emission
features at energies above $\sim$100 GeV will show significant variability (or

(CAMSN) to form an improved infrastructure for multi-sensor image fusion. It
considers contexts driven by a node and sink. The contexts such as general and
critical object detection are node driven where as sensing time (such as day or
night) is sink driven. The agencies used in the scheme are categorized as node
and sink agency. Each agency employs a set of static and mobile agents to
perform dedicated tasks. Node agency performs context sensing and context
interpretation based on the sensed image and sensing time. Node agency
comprises of node manager agent, context agent and node blackboard (NBB).
Context agent gathers the context from the target and updates the NBB, Node
manager agent interprets the context and passes the context information to sink
node by using flooding mechanism. Sink agency mainly comprises of sink manager
agent, fusing agent, and sink black board. A context at the sensor node
triggers the fusion process at the sink. Based on the context, sink manager
agent triggers the fusing agent. Fusing agent roams around the network, visits
active sensor node, fuses the relevant images and sends the fused image to
sink. The fusing agent uses wavelet transform for fusion. The scheme is
simulated for testing its operation effectiveness in terms of fusion time, mean
square error, throughput, dropping rate, bandwidth requirement, node battery
usage and agent overhead.

Using high-resolution, 3-dimensional N-body/SPH simulations, we found that the
spiral features of the gas in galactic disks are formed by essentially
different mechanisms from the galactic shock in stellar density waves. The
stellar spiral arms and the interstellar matter on average corotate in a
galactic potential at any radii. Unlike the stream motions in the galactic
shock, the interstellar matter flows into the local potential minima with
irregular motions. The flows converge to form dense gas clouds/filaments near
the bottom of the stellar spirals, whose global structures resemble dust-lanes
seen in late-type spiral galaxies. The stellar arms are non-steady; they are
wound and stretched by the galactic shear, and thus local densities of the arm
change on a time scale of ~ 100 Myrs, due to bifurcating or merging with other
arms. This makes the gas spirals associated with the stellar arms non-steady.
The association of dense gas clouds are eventually dissolved into inter-arm
regions with non-cirucular motions. Star clusters are formed from the cold,
dense gases, whose ages are less than ~30 Myrs, and they are roughly associated
with the background stellar arms without a clear spatial offset between gas
spiral arms and distribution of young stars.

$\mathbb{Z}^d$ with random coefficients $A$ of the simplest type: they are
identically distributed and independent from edge to edge. On scales large
w.r.t. the lattice spacing (i.e., unity), the solution operator is known to
behave like the solution operator of a (continuous) elliptic equation with
constant deterministic coefficients. This symmetric ``homogenized'' matrix
$A_{\mathrm {hom}}=a_{\mathrm {hom}}\operatorname {Id}$ is characterized by
$\xi\cdot A_{\mathrm {hom}}\xi=\langle(\xi+\nabla\phi )\cdot
A(\xi+\nabla\phi)\rangle$ for any direction $\xi\in\mathbb {R}^d$, where the
random field $\phi$ (the ``corrector'') is the unique solution of
$-\nabla^*\cdot A(\xi+\nabla\phi)=0$ such that $\phi(0)=0$, $\nabla\phi$ is
stationary and $\langle\nabla\phi\rangle=0$, $\langle\cdot\rangle$ denoting the
ensemble average (or expectation). It is known (``by ergodicity'') that the
above ensemble average of the energy density $\mathcal
{E}=(\xi+\nabla\phi)\cdot A(\xi+\nabla\phi)$, which is a stationary random
field, can be recovered by a system average. We quantify this by proving that
the variance of a spatial average of $\mathcal {E}$ on length scales $L$
satisfies the optimal estimate, that is, $\operatorname {var}[\sum \mathcal
{E}\eta_L]\lesssim L^{-d}$, where the averaging function [i.e., $\sum\eta_L=1$,
$\operatorname {supp}(\eta_L)\subset\{|x|\le L\}$] has to be smooth in the
sense that $|\nabla\eta_L|\lesssim L^{-1-d}$. In two space dimensions (i.e.,
$d=2$), there is a logarithmic correction. This estimate is optimal since it
shows that smooth averages of the energy density $\mathcal {E}$ decay in $L$ as
if $\mathcal {E}$ would be independent from edge to edge (which it is not for
$d>1$). This result is of practical significance, since it allows to estimate
the dominant error when numerically computing $a_{\mathrm {hom}}$.

inflation,i.e.,how many times will it grow than today's size is been speculated
and analysed thereafter. Different kinds of fluids are taken to be the matter
inside the brane. It is observed that in the case of highly positive pressure
grower gas like polytropic,the size of the universe at the end of inflation is
comparitively smaller. Whereas for negative pressure creators (like chaplygin
gas) this size is much bigger. Except thse two cases, inflation has been
studied for barotropic fluid and linear redshift parametrization $\omega(z) =
\omega_{0} + \omega_{1} z$ too. For them the size of the universe after
inflation is much more high. We also have seen that this size does not depend
upon the potential energy at the end of the inflation. On the contrary, there
is a high impact of the initial potential energy upon the size of inflation.

Its velocity structure suggests an aspherical morphology. The near-infrared
excess of the source, which was especially strong in 1999, indicated that a
thick circumstellar dust shell was also present in the system. The carbon star

However, homogeneity cannot be directly observed in the galaxy distribution or
CMB, even with perfect observations, since we observe on the past lightcone and
not on spatial surfaces. We can directly observe and test for isotropy, but to
link this to homogeneity, we need to assume the Copernican Principle. First, we
discuss the link between isotropic observations on the past lightcone and
isotropic spacetime geometry: what observations do we need to be isotropic in
order to deduce spacetime isotropy? Second, we discuss what we can say with the
Copernican assumption. The most powerful result is based on the CMB: the
vanishing of the dipole, quadrupole and octupole of the CMB is sufficient to
impose homogeneity. Real observations lead to near-isotropy on large scales -
does this lead to near-homogeneity? There are important partial results, and we
discuss why this remains a difficult open question. Thus we are currently
unable to prove homogeneity of the Universe on large-scales, even with the
Copernican Principle. However we can use observations of the CMB, galaxies and

adsorbed atoms and molecules and, more generally, to defects such as vacancies,
holes and/or substitutional dopants. This property, apart from being directly
usable in molecular sensor devices, can also be employed to tune graphene
electronic properties. Here we briefly review the basic features of
atomic-scale defects that can be useful for material design. After a brief
introduction on isolated $p_z$ defects, we analyse the electronic structure of
multiple defective graphene substrates, and show how to predict the presence of
microscopically ordered magnetic structures. Subsequently, we analyse the more
complicated situation where the electronic structure, as modified by the
presence of some defects, affects chemical reactivity of the substrate towards
adsorption (chemisorption) of atomic/molecular species, leading to preferential
sticking on specific lattice positions. Then, we consider the reverse problem,
that is how to use defects to engineer graphene electronic properties. In this
context, we show that arranging defects to form honeycomb-shaped superlattices
(what we may call ""supergraphenes"") a sizeable gap opens in the band structure
and new Dirac cones are created right close to the gapped region. Similarly, we
show that substitutional dopants such as group IIIA/VA elements may have gapped
quasi-conical structures corresponding to massive Dirac carriers. All these
possible structures might find important technological applications in the
development of graphene-based logic transistors.

Moreover, this phase transition is continuous, i.e., in the limit the function
f(c) denoting the fraction of vertices in the largest component in the process
after cn edge insertions is continuous. A variation of the Erd\""os-R\'enyi
process are the so-called Achlioptas processes in which in every step a random
pair of edges is drawn, and a fixed edge-selection rule selects one of them to
be included in the graph while the other is put back. Recently, Achlioptas,
D'Souza and Spencer (2009) gave strong numerical evidence that a variety of
edge-selection rules exhibit a discontinuous phase transition. However, Riordan

condition of orthogonality of the product vectors, while keeping the relation
between the density matrix and the projection on the subspace defined by the
UPB. We examine first this generalization for the 3x3 system where numerical
studies indicate that one-parameter families of such generalized states can be
found. Similar numerical searches in higher dimensional systems show the
presence of extremal PPT states of similar form. Based on these results we
suggest that the UPB construction of the lowest rank entangled states in the
3x3 system can be generalized to higher dimensions, with the use of
non-orthogonal UPBs.

influences the typicality of a single exemplar and the applicability of a
single property of a concept, which provides a solution of the 'Pet-Fish

model has been worked out which reproduces the membership weights of several
exemplars of concepts and their combinations. We show in this paper that a
further relevant effect appears in a natural way whenever two or more concepts
combine, namely, 'entanglement'. The presence of entanglement is explicitly
revealed by considering a specific example with two concepts, constructing some
Bell's inequalities for this example, testing them in a real experiment with
test subjects, and finally proving that Bell's inequalities are violated in
this case. We show that the intrinsic and unavoidable character of entanglement
can be explained in terms of the weights of the exemplars of the combined

  If the transmission power of each link is part of the input (and arbitrary),
then $\sigdiv = O(\log\Gamma + \log \Delta)$, where $\Gamma$ denotes the ratio

energy distribution of the metal with the cluster obtained in a reference

investigate analytically the protein restraints on the binding site in terms of
its eigenmodes. Examining these eigenmodes suggests, consistent with
experimental observations, the importance of the first histidine (H) in the
CCHH cluster in metal binding. Further, the eigenvalues corresponding to these

metal-binding, emphasizing that the favorable energetics of metal-residue
interaction is necessary to drive folding in this system. The representation of
the bulk protein and solvent response by a local field allows us to perform
Monte Carlo simulations of the metal-residue cluster using quantum-chemical
approaches, here using a semi-empirical Hamiltonian. For configurations sampled

dynamics associated with index k saddles (k > 1) of the potential energy
surface. Using normal form theory, we give an explicit formula for a ""dividing
surface"" in phase space, i.e. a co-dimension one surface (within the energy
shell) through which all trajectories that ""cross"" the region of the index k
saddle must pass. With a generic non-resonance assumption, the normal form
provides k (approximate) integrals that describe the saddle dynamics in a
neighborhood of the index k saddle. These integrals provide a symbolic
description of all trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the saddle.
We give a parametrization of the dividing surface which is used as the basis
for a numerical method to sample the dividing surface. Our techniques are
applied to isomerization dynamics on a potential energy surface having 4
minima; two symmetry related pairs of minima are connected by low energy index
one saddles, with the pairs themselves connected via higher energy index one
saddles and an index two saddle at the origin. We compute and sample the
dividing surface and show that our approach enables us to distinguish between
concerted crossing (""hilltop crossing"") isomerizing trajectories and those
trajectories that are not concerted crossing (potentially sequentially
isomerizing trajectories). We then consider the effect of additional ""bath
modes"" on the dynamics, which is a four degree-of-freedom system. For this
system we show that the normal form and dividing surface can be realized and
sampled and that, using the approximate integrals of motion and our symbolic
description of trajectories, we are able to choose initial conditions
corresponding to concerted crossing isomerizing trajectories and (potentially)
sequentially isomerizing trajectories.

selected AGN from the XMM-Newton Bright Serendipitous Source sample (XBS). We
find that the observed large range of [OIII]5007A equivalent widths observed in
the sample (from a few A up to 500A) is well explained as a combination of an
intrinsic spread, probably due to the large range of covering factors of the
Narrow Line Region, and the effect of absorption. The intrinsic spread is
dominant for EW below 40-50A while absorption brings the values of EW up to
~100-150A, for moderate levels of absorption (AV~0.5-2 mag) or up to ~500A for
AV>2 mag. In this picture, the absorption has a significant impact on the
observed EW also in type~1 AGN. Using numerical simulations we find that this
model is able to reproduce the [OIII]5007A EW distribution observed in the XBS

In this way, we get a correct algorithm that is simple to implement and

method; we adapt that method to be able to cope with inaccuracies when
evaluating $f$, without sacrificing its quadratic convergence behavior. We
prove a bound on the bit complexity of our algorithm in terms of the degree of

exclusively related to the geometric location of the roots. Our bound is near

that the one-parameter family of quantum graphs possesses a purely discrete and
strictly positive spectrum for each $\kappa>0$ and prove that the Dirichlet
Laplacian is the limit of the one-parameter family in the strong resolvent
sense. The spectrum of the resulting Dirichlet quantum graph is also purely
discrete. The eigenvalues are given by $\lambda_n=n^2$, $n\in\nz$, with
multiplicities $d(n)$, where $d(n)$ denotes the divisor function. We thus can
relate the spectral problem of this infinite quantum graph to Dirichlet's
famous divisor problem and infer the non-standard Weyl asymptotics
$\mathcal{N}(\lambda)=\frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{2}\ln\lambda +\Or(\sqrt{\lambda})$
for the eigenvalue counting function. Based on an exact trace formula, the
Vorono\""i summation formula, we derive explicit formulae for the trace of the
wave group, the heat kernel, the resolvent and for various spectral zeta
functions. These results enable us to establish a well-defined (renormalized)
secular equation and a Selberg-like zeta function defined in terms of the
classical periodic orbits of the graph, for which we derive an exact functional
equation and prove that the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis is true.

on a beam of non interacting thermal neutrons. The comparison between the
results recorded with a high energy-resolution source of neutrons and those
recorded with a broad energy-resolution source enables us to clarify the role
played by the beam coherence in the occurrence of the antibunching effect.
