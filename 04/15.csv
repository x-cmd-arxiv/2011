which the ensemble associated to a quantum state really exists: it is the
ensemble of all the systems in the same quantum state in the universe.
Individual systems within the ensemble have microscopic states, described by
beables. The probabilities of quantum theory turn out to be just ordinary
relative frequencies probabilities in these ensembles. Laws for the evolution
of the beables of individual systems are given such that their ensemble
relative frequencies evolve in a way that reproduces the predictions of quantum
mechanics. These laws are highly non-local and involve a new kind of
interaction between the members of an ensemble that define a quantum state.
These include a stochastic process by which individual systems copy the beables
of other systems in the ensembles of which they are a member. The probabilities
for these copy processes do not depend on where the systems are in space, but
do depend on the distribution of beables in the ensemble. Macroscopic systems
then are distinguished by being large and complex enough that they have no
copies in the universe. They then cannot evolve by the copy law, and hence do
not evolve stochastically according to quantum dynamics. This implies novel
departures from quantum mechanics for systems in quantum states that can be
expected to have few copies in the universe. At the same time, we are able to
argue that the centre of masses of large macroscopic systems do satisfy
Newton's laws.

documents is still lacking from its accuracy. This paper proposes the bar-tree
representation to describe the whole pattern of web pages in an efficient way

pattern and extract the region of interest from \textit{top root}, the reverse
algorithm recognizes the pattern from the region of interest to both top and
bottom roots simultaneously. The attributes are then extracted and labeled
reversely from the region of interest of targeted contents. Since using
conventional representations for the algorithm should require more
computational power, the bar-tree method is developed to represent the
generated patterns using bar graphs characterized by the depths and widths from
the document roots. We show that this representation is suitable for extracting
the data from the semi-structured web sources, and for detecting the template
changes of targeted pages. The experimental results show perfect recognition

statistical tests are often inadequate for research areas, like the life
sciences, where the typical sample size is small and the test assumptions
difficult to verify. In such conditions, standard tests tend to be overly
conservative, and fail thus to detect significant effects in the data. Here we
define a novel statistical test for the two-sample problem. Several
characteristics make it an attractive alternative to classical two-sample
tests: 1) It is based on Bayesian model selection, and thus takes into account
uncertainty about the model's parameters, mitigating the problem of small
samples size; 2) The null hypothesis is compared with several alternative
hypotheses, making the test suitable in different experimental scenarios; 3)
The test is constructed as a frequentist test, and defines significance with
the conventional bound on Type I errors. We analyze the power of the test and
find that it is higher than the power of other standard options, like the
t-test (up to 25% higher) for a wide range of sample and effect sizes, and is
at most 1% lower when the assumptions of the t-test are perfectly matched. We
discuss and evaluate two variants of the test, that define different prior
distributions over the parameters of the hypotheses.

In this paper, we
extend previous work on an abstract model of city traffic to allow for multiple
street intersections. We test a self-organizing method in our model, showing
that it is close to theoretical optima and superior to a traditional method of
traffic light coordination.
  Abstract: The elementary cellular automaton following rule 184 can mimic
particles flowing in one direction at a constant speed. This automaton can
therefore model highway traffic. In a recent paper, we have incorporated
intersections regulated by traffic lights to this model using exclusively
elementary cellular automata. In such a paper, however, we only explored a
rectangular grid. We now extend our model to more complex scenarios employing
an hexagonal grid. This extension shows first that our model can readily
incorporate multiple-way intersections and hence simulate complex scenarios. In
addition, the current extension allows us to study and evaluate the behavior of
two different kinds of traffic light controller for a grid of six-way streets
allowing for either two or three street intersections: a traffic light that
tries to adapt to the amount of traffic (which results in self-organizing
traffic lights) and a system of synchronized traffic lights with coordinated
rigid periods (sometimes called the ""green wave"" method). We observe a tradeoff
between system capacity and topological complexity. The green wave method is
unable to cope with the complexity of a higher-capacity scenario, while the
self-organizing method is scalable, adapting to the complexity of a scenario
and exploiting its maximum capacity. Additionally, in this paper we propose a
benchmark, independent of methods and models, to measure the performance of a
traffic light controller comparing it against a theoretical optimum.

These solutions carry a nonzero electric charge and have finite mass. For
globally regular solutions, the value of the electric charge is fixed by the
Chern-Simons coupling constant. The black holes can be thought as non-linear
superpositions of Reissner-Nordstrom and non-Abelian configurations. A

for CO J=2-->1 outflows. A young very low mass star MHO 5 (in Taurus) with an
estimated mass of 90 M_J, which is just above the hydrogen-burning limit, shows
two gas lobes that are likely outflows. While the CO map of MHO 5 does not show
a clear structure of outflow, possibly due to environment gas, its
position-velocity diagram indicates two distinct blue- and redshifted

molecular outflow from MHO 5. We estimate an outflow mass of 7.0 x 10^-5 M_Sun

magnitude smaller than the typical ones for T Tauri stars and somewhat weaker

investigate the potential implications of this energy loss channel to the

two phenomenological models are proposed to generalize the experimental

damping coefficient. A more elaborate phenomenological model assumes that the
noncontact friction is a consequence of the Casimir force acting between the
closely spaced surfaces. Both models provide quantitative results for the
noncontact friction between any two objects which are then used to estimate the
energy loss for suspended bar micro- and nanoresonators. Its is concluded that

two new methods to make a cosmological model-independent test of the
distance-duality (DD) relation. The luminosity distances come from Union2
compilation of Supernovae Type Ia. The angular diameter distances are given by
two cluster models (De Filippis et al. and Bonamente et al.). The advantage of
our methods is that it can reduce statistical errors. Concerning the
morphological hypotheses for cluster models, it is mainly focused on the
comparison between elliptical $\beta$-model and spherical $\beta$-model. The
spherical $\beta$-model is divided into two groups in terms of different
reduction methods of angular diameter distances, i.e. conservative spherical
$\beta$-model and corrected spherical $\beta$-model. Our results show that the
DD relation is consistent with the elliptical $\beta$-model at $1\sigma$
confidence level (CL) for both methods, whereas for almost all spherical
$\beta$-model parameterizations, the DD relation can only be accommodated at
$3\sigma$ CL, particularly for the conservative spherical $\beta$-model. In
order to minimize systematic uncertainties, we also apply the test to the
overlap sample, i.e. the same set of clusters modeled by both De Filippis et
al. and Bonamente et al.. It is found that the DD relation is compatible with
the elliptically modeled overlap sample at $1\sigma$ CL, however for most of
the parameterizations, the DD relation can not be accommodated even at
$3\sigma$ CL for any of the two spherical $\beta$-models. Therefore it is
reasonable that the marked triaxial ellipsoidal model is a better geometrical
hypothesis describing the structure of the galaxy cluster compared with the
spherical $\beta$-model if the DD relation is valid in cosmological
observations.

of observations indicate that it is non-baryonic and non-relativistic. One of
the preferred candidates for non-baryonic DM is a weakly interacting massive
particle (WIMP) that in most models is stable. WIMP self-annihilation can
produce cosmic rays, gamma rays, and other particles with signatures that may
be detectable. Hints of anomalous cosmic-ray spectra found by recent
experiments, such as PAMELA, have motivated interesting interpretations in
terms of DM annihilation and/or decay. However, these signatures also have
standard astrophysical interpretations, so additional evidence is needed in
order to make a case for detection of DM annihilation or decay. Searches by the
Fermi Large Area Telescope for gamma-ray signals from clumps, nearby dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, and galaxy clusters have also been performed, along with
measurements of the diffuse Galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray emission. In
addition, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes like HESS, MAGIC, and

This type
of generalisation is relevant to models of ageing in language change, allowing
the representation of changes in speakers' learning rates over their lifetime

microscopic level change with time. The mean time taken to reach consensus
varies in a nontrivial way with the rate of change of the flip-rates, varying
between bounds given by the mean consensus times for static homogeneous (the
original Voter Model) and static heterogeneous flip-rates. By considering the
mean time between interactions for each agent, we derive excellent estimates of
the mean consensus times and exit probabilities for any time scale of flip-rate
variation. The scaling of consensus times with population size on complex
networks is correctly predicted, and is as would be expected for the ordinary
voter model. Heterogeneity in the initial distribution of opinions has a strong
effect, considerably reducing the mean time to consensus, while increasing the
probability of survival of the opinion which initially occupies the most slowly
changing agents. The mean times to reach consensus for different states are
very different. An opinion originally held by the fastest changing agents has a
smaller chance to succeed, and takes much longer to do so than an evenly
distributed opinion.

controlling many essential biological functions, including cellular
differentiation and cell cycle control. However, establishing the network
topologies that can exhibit bistability remains a challenge, in part due to the
exceedingly large variety of GRNs that exist for even a small number of
components. We begin to address this problem by employing chemical reaction
network theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity
for bistability of more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two
transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins (assuming only
the most elementary biochemical processes). We find that there exist reaction
rate constants leading to bistability in ~90% of these GRN models, including
several circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly
associated with bistable systems, and the majority of which could only be
identified as bistable through an original subnetwork-based analysis. A
topological sorting of the two-gene family of networks based on the presence or
absence of biochemical reactions reveals eleven minimal bistable networks
(i.e., bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable
subnetwork). The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies
suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with
relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. To highlight
the relevance of the systematic application of CRNT to bistable network
identification in real biological systems, we integrated publicly available
protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave
in a bistable fashion.

field limit in view of gravitational lensing. Though an additional Yukawa term
in the gravitational potential modifies dynamics with respect to the standard
Newtonian limit of General Relativity, the motion of massless particles results
unaffected thanks to suitable cancellations in the post-Newtonian limit. Thus,
all the lensing observables are equal to the ones known from General
Relativity. Since f(R)-gravity is claimed, among other things, to be a possible
solution to overcome for the need of dark matter in virialized systems, we
discuss the impact of our results on the dynamical and gravitational lensing
analyses. In this framework, dynamics could, in principle, be able to reproduce
the astrophysical observations without recurring to dark matter, but in the
case of gravitational lensing we find that dark matter is an unavoidable
ingredient. Another important implication is that gravitational lensing, in the
post-Newtonian limit, is not able to constrain these extended theories, since
their predictions do not differ from General Relativity.

  eigenvectors for regression","29 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables; typo/notational errors edited and
  intro revised per journal review process",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the challenges with functional data is incorporating spatial
structure, or local correlation, into the analysis. This structure is inherent
in the output from an increasing number of biomedical technologies, and a
functional linear model is often used to estimate the relationship between the
predictor functions and scalar responses. Common approaches to the ill-posed
problem of estimating a coefficient function typically involve two stages:
regularization and estimation. Regularization is usually done via dimension
reduction, projecting onto a predefined span of basis functions or a reduced
set of eigenvectors (principal components). In contrast, we present a unified
approach that directly incorporates spatial structure into the estimation
process by exploiting the joint eigenproperties of the predictors and a linear
penalty operator. In this sense, the components in the regression are
`partially empirical' and the framework is provided by the generalized singular
value decomposition (GSVD). The GSVD clarifies the penalized estimation process
and informs the choice of penalty by making explicit the joint influence of the
penalty and predictors on the bias, variance, and performance of the estimated
coefficient function. Laboratory spectroscopy data and simulations are used to
illustrate the concepts.

performed in an unknotted self-avoiding polygon on the simple cubic lattice. We
assume that two polygon segments have already been brought close together for
the purpose of performing a strand passage, and model this using Theta-SAPs,
polygons that contain the pattern Theta at a fixed location. It is proved that
the number of n-edge Theta-SAPs grows exponentially (with n) at the same rate
as the total number of n-edge unknotted self-avoiding polygons, and that the
same holds for subsets of n-edge Theta-SAPs that yield a specific
after-strand-passage knot-type. Thus the probability of a given
after-strand-passage knot-type does not grow (or decay) exponentially with n,
and we conjecture that instead it approaches a knot-type dependent amplitude
ratio lying strictly between 0 and 1. This is supported by critical exponent
estimates obtained from a new maximum likelihood method for Theta-SAPs that are
generated by a composite (aka multiple) Markov Chain Monte Carlo BFACF
algorithm. We also give strong numerical evidence that the after-strand-passage
knotting probability depends on the local structure around the strand passage
site. Considering both the local structure and the crossing-sign at the strand
passage site, we observe that the more ""compact"" the local structure, the less
likely the after-strand-passage polygon is to be knotted. This trend is
consistent with results from other strand-passage models, however, we are the
first to note the influence of the crossing-sign information. Two measures of
""compactness"" are used: the size of a smallest polygon that contains the
structure and the structure's ""opening"" angle. The opening angle definition is
consistent with one that is measurable from single molecule DNA experiments.

optimal solution. We study several special cases of \gpp, and give constant
approximation mechanisms for matroid, matching, knapsack, and the generalized
assignment problem. Our result for generalized assignment problem solves an
open problem proposed in \cite{DG10}.
  Our main technical contribution is in exploitation of the approaches from
stable matching, which is a fundamental solution concept in the context of
matching marketplaces, in application to mechanism design. Stable matching,
while conceptually simple, provides a set of powerful tools to manage and
analyze self-interested behaviors of participating agents. Our mechanism uses a
stable matching algorithm as a critical component and adopts other approaches
like random sampling and online mechanisms. Our work also enriches the stable
matching theory with a new knapsack constrained matching model.

measure size and photometric component distributions, where photometric

the median half-light radius rises from 1.0 kpc at z=3.1 to 1.4 kpc at z=2.1. A

there is no evidence for evolution in the number of multi-component systems. In

other physical properties derived from its SED. LAEs are found to be larger for
galaxies with higher stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust obscuration,
but there is no evidence for a trend between equivalent width and half-light

wide range of objects are being selected by LAE surveys at z~2, including a

expansion of 60 levels of the core ion Fe XVIII ranging over a wide energy
range of nearly 900 eV between the n = 2 and n = 3 levels. Strong coupling
effects due to dipole transition arrays 2p^5 --> 2p^4 (3s,3d) manifest
themselves as large PEC resonances throughout this range, and enhance the
effective photoionization cross sections orders of magnitude above the

previous calculations shows that the currently available cross sections
considerably underestimate the bound-free cross sections. A
level-identification scheme is used for spectroscopic designation of the 454

sections are computed for all levels. In addition, partial cross sections for
leaving the core ion Fe XVII in the ground state are also obtained. These

weight in a weighted graph. In particular, we show that the minimum weight
cycle problem in an undirected n-node graph with edge weights in {1,...,M} or
in a directed n-node graph with edge weights in {-M,..., M} and no negative
cycles can be efficiently reduced to finding a minimum weight triangle in an
Theta(n)-node undirected graph with weights in {1,...,O(M)}. Roughly speaking,
our reductions imply the following surprising phenomenon: a minimum cycle with
an arbitrary number of weighted edges can be ""encoded"" using only three edges
within roughly the same weight interval! This resolves a longstanding open
problem posed by Itai and Rodeh [SIAM J. Computing 1978 and STOC'77].
  A direct consequence of our efficient reductions are O (Mn^{omega})-time
algorithms using fast matrix multiplication (FMM) for finding a minimum weight
cycle in both undirected graphs with integral weights from the interval [1,M]
and directed graphs with integral weights from the interval [-M,M]. The latter
seems to reveal a strong separation between the all pairs shortest paths (APSP)
problem and the minimum weight cycle problem in directed graphs as the fastest
known APSP algorithm has a running time of O(M^{0.681}n^{2.575}) by Zwick [J.
ACM 2002].
  In contrast, when only combinatorial algorithms are allowed (that is, without
FMM) the only known solution to minimum weight cycle is by computing APSP.
Interestingly, any separation between the two problems in this case would be an
amazing breakthrough as by a recent paper by Vassilevska W. and Williams
[FOCS'10], any O(n^{3-eps})-time algorithm (eps>0) for minimum weight cycle
immediately implies a O(n^{3-delta})-time algorithm (delta>0) for APSP.

new parameters. The charged octo-triplet decay into a W boson and a gluon is
suppressed by a loop factor and an accidental cancellation. Thus, the main
decays of the charged octo-triplet may occur through higher-dimensional
operators, mediated by a heavy vectorlike fermion, into quark pairs. For an
octo-triplet mass below the t\bar{b} threshold, the decay into Wb\bar{b} or
Wb\bar{s} through an off-shell top quark has a width comparable to that into
c\bar{s} or c\bar{b}. Pair production with one octo-triplet decaying into two
jets and the other decaying into a W and two soft b jets may explain the
dijet-plus-W excess reported by the CDF Collaboration. Using a few kinematic
distributions, we compare two mechanisms of octo-triplet pair production:
through an s-channel coloron and through the coupling to gluons. The
higher-dimensional operators that allow dijet decays also lead to CP violation

successful in detecting remnants with bright X-ray emission, which we find is

weakly defined gradient operator over discontinuous functions with
heterogeneous properties. The use of weak gradients and their approximations
results in a new concept called {\em discrete weak gradients} which is expected
to play important roles in numerical methods for partial differential
equations. This article intends to provide a general framework for operating
differential operators on functions with heterogeneous properties. As a
demonstrative example, the discrete weak gradient operator is employed as a
building block to approximate the solution of a model second order elliptic
problem, in which the classical gradient operator is replaced by the discrete
weak gradient. The resulting numerical approximation is called a weak Galerkin
(WG) finite element solution. It can be seen that the weak Galerkin method
allows the use of totally discontinuous functions in the finite element
procedure. For the second order elliptic problem, an optimal order error
estimate in both a discrete $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms are established for the
corresponding weak Galerkin finite element solutions. A superconvergence is
also observed for the weak Galerkin approximation.

place in achieving, for instance, the spectroscopic characterization of

Ground or space-based multi-aperture infrared interferometry is a promising
technique to tackle these goals. But significant efforts still need to be
undertaken to achieve a simplification of these instruments if we want to
combine the light from a large number of telescopes. Integrated-optics appears
as an alternative to the current conventional designs, especially if its use
can be extended to a higher number of astronomical bands. This article reports
for the first time the experimental demonstration of the feasibility of an
integrated-optics approach to mid-infrared beam combination for single-mode
stellar interferometry. We have fabricated a 2-telescope beam combiner
prototype integrated on a substrate of chalcogenide glasses, a material
transparent from 1 to 14 um. We have developed laboratory tools to characterize
the modal properties and the interferometric capabilities of our device. We
obtain fringes at 10 um and measure a mean contrast V=0.981 \pm 0.001 with high
repeatability over one week and high stability over 5h. We show experimentally
- as well as on the basis of modeling considerations - that the component has a
single-mode behavior at this wavelength, which is essential to achieve
high-accuracy interferometry. From previous studies, the propagation losses are
estimated to 0.5 dB/cm for such components. We also discuss possible issues
that may impact the interferometric contrast. The IO beam combiner performs
well at 10. We also anticipate the requirement of a better matching between the
numerical apertures of the component and the (de)coupling optics to optimize
the total throughput. The next step foreseen is the achievement of wide-band

led to the detection of single-emission-line sources as faint as F ~ 2 x
10^{-18} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}, a sensitivity 5 times deeper than our first

= 10^{-17.6} (2.5) x 10^{-18} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}. At this flux the putative

between UT 2007 June 29 and UT 2009 Feb 4. We find that the best-fit transit
depths for visits in the same bandpass can vary by as much as 8% of the total
(4.7 sigma significance) from one epoch to the next. Although we cannot
entirely rule out residual detector effects or a time-varying, high-altitude
cloud layer in the planet's atmosphere as the cause of these variations, we
consider the occultation of active regions on the star in a subset of the
transit observations to be the most likely explanation. We reconcile the
presence of magnetically active regions with the lack of significant visible or
infrared flux variations from the star by proposing that the star's spin axis
is tilted with respect to our line of sight, and that the planet's orbit is
therefore likely to be misaligned. These observations serve to illustrate the
challenges associated with transmission spectroscopy of planets orbiting
late-type stars; we expect that other systems, such as GJ 1214, may display
comparably variable transit depths. Our measured 8 micron secondary eclipse
depths are consistent with a constant value, and we place a 1 sigma upper limit
of 17% on changes in the planet's dayside flux in this band. Averaging over the
eleven visits gives us an improved estimate of 0.0452% +/- 0.0027% for the
secondary eclipse depth. We combine timing information from our observations
with previously published data to produce a refined orbital ephemeris, and
determine that the best-fit transit and eclipse times are consistent with a
constant orbital period. [ABRIDGED]

the H3+ R(3,3)l line, which is due only to gas in the GC, closely matches the
differences between the H3+ R(1,1)l and CO line profiles, just as it does for
previously studied sightlines in the GC. Absorption in the R(2,2)l line of H3+
is present in J1747 at velocities between -60 and +100 km/s. This is the second
clear detection of this line in the interstellar medium after GCIRS 3 in the

350 K, significantly warmer than in the diffuse clouds in other parts of the

reasons. They are angularly very close to their parent star, which is several
magnitudes brighter. Direct imaging of exoplanets thus requires a dedicated
instrumentation with large telescopes and accurate wavefront control devices
for high-angular resolution and coronagraphs for attenuating the stellar light.
Coronagraphs are usually chromatic and they cannot perform high-contrast
imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth. That chromaticity will be critical for
future instruments. Enlarging the coronagraph spectral range is a challenge for
future exoplanet imaging instruments on both space-based and ground-based
telescopes. We propose the multi-stage four-quadrant phase mask that associates
several monochromatic four-quadrant phase mask coronagraphs in series.
Monochromatic device performance has already been demonstrated and the
manufacturing procedures are well-under control since their development for
previous instruments on VLT and JWST. The multi-stage implementation simplicity
is thus appealing. We present the instrument principle and we describe the
laboratory performance for large spectral bandwidths and for both pupil shapes
for space- (off-axis telescope) and ground-based (E-ELT) telescopes. The
multi-stage four-quadrant phase mask reduces the stellar flux over a wide

look at the small-scale environments of the AGN reveals that the neighbouring
galaxies of radio-loud AGN have U-B colours more skewed towards the
`green-valley' and the red sequence, whereas the neighbours of X-ray AGN show
no difference to the general galaxy population. This suggests that although
both AGN types live in overdense environments, the radio-loud AGN may be
preferentially located in more evolved cluster cores, in a similar environment

intensity of its emission increases significantly and rapidly. We present an
analysis of high-resolution, almost-nightly optical spectra obtained before,
during and after a major flare, whose complex emission lines are deconstructed
into single gaussians and demonstrate the different modes of mass loss in the
SS433 system. During our monitoring, an initial period of quiescence was
followed by increased activity which culminated in a radio flare. In the
transition period the accretion disc of SS433 became visible in H-alpha and HeI
emission lines and remained so until the observations were terminated; the
line-of-sight velocity of the centre of the disc lines during this time behaved
as though the binary orbit has significant eccentricity rather than being
circular, consistent with three recent lines of evidence. After the accretion
disc appeared its rotation speed increased steadily from 500 to 700 km/s. The
launch speed of the jets first decreased then suddenly increased. At the same
time as the jet launch speed increased, the wind from the accretion disc
doubled in speed. Two days afterwards, the radio flux exhibited a flare. These
data suggest that a massive ejection of material from the companion star loaded
the accretion disc and the system responded with mass loss via different modes
that together comprise the flare phenomena. We find that archival data reveal
similar behaviour, in that when the measured jet launch speed exceeds 0.29c
this is invariably simultaneous with, or a few days before, a radio flare. Thus
we surmise that a major flare consists of the overloading of the accretion
disc, resulting in the speeding up of the H-alpha rotation disc lines, followed
by enhanced mass loss not just via its famous jets at higher-than-usual speeds
but also directly from its accretion disc's wind.

limitation in the parameter space to the gauge coupling constant

compatible with the so-called Adjoint $\mathsf{SU(5)}$. The triplets must live

the star is a very luminous, log(L/Lsun)~5.9 dex, and massive, M~50 Msun,
object, showing a very high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio in its surface (N/O~8, by
mass). Based on the derived Mg and Si abundances, we argue that this high N/O
ratio cannot be the result of an initial low O content due to its location on
the disk of M33, known to present a steep metallicity gradient. In combination
with the He abundance, the most plausible interpretation is that UIT005 is in
an advanced stage of evolution, showing in its surface N enrichment and O
depletion resulting from mixing with CNO processed material from the stellar
interior. A comparison with the predictions of current stellar evolutionary
models indicates that there are significant discrepancies, in particular with
regard to the degree of chemical processing, with the models predicting a much
lower degree of O depletion than observed. At the same time, the mass-loss rate
derived in our analysis is an order of magnitude lower than the values
considered in the evolutionary calculations. Based on a study of the
surrounding stellar population and the nearby cluster NGC588, using WFPC2

satellites. Here we show that no such discrepancy exists if haloes are made of
warm, rather than cold dark matter because these haloes are less concentrated
on account of their typically later formation epochs. Warm dark matter is one
of several possible explanations for the observed kinematics of the satellites.

new clustering ensemble method---Cluster Forests (CF) is proposed.
Geometrically, CF randomly probes a high-dimensional data cloud to obtain ""good
local clusterings"" and then aggregates via spectral clustering to obtain
cluster assignments for the whole dataset. The search for good local
clusterings is guided by a cluster quality measure kappa. CF progressively
improves each local clustering in a fashion that resembles the tree growth in
RF. Empirical studies on several real-world datasets under two different
performance metrics show that CF compares favorably to its competitors.
Theoretical analysis reveals that the kappa measure makes it possible to grow
the local clustering in a desirable way---it is ""noise-resistant"". A
closed-form expression is obtained for the mis-clustering rate of spectral
clustering under a perturbation model, which yields new insights into some
aspects of spectral clustering.

any given sky position and frequency evolution, the F-statistic is the optimal

searches for previously unknown GW pulsars, it would be computationally
intractable to calculate the (fully coherent) F-statistic at every point of a
(suitably fine) grid covering the parameter space: the number of gridpoints is
many orders of magnitude too large for that. Here we introduce a
""phase-relaxed"" F-statistic, which we denote F_pr, for incoherently combining
the results of fully coherent searches over short time intervals. We estimate
(very roughly) that for realistic searches, our F_pr is ~10-15% more sensitive

byproduct of computing F_pr, one obtains a rough determination of the
time-evolving phase offset between one's template and the true signal imbedded
in the detector noise. Almost all the ingredients that go into calculating F_pr
are already implemented in LAL, so we expect that relatively little additional

  We prove that the error probability vanishes only subexponentially in the

precisely the case of binary messages, decay is subexponential for any decision

interconnected nodes can perform a global computation in the widely studied
GOSSIP model of communication. In this model, nodes do not know the global
topology of the network, and they may only initiate contact with a single
neighbor in each round. This model contrasts with the much less restrictive
LOCAL model, where a node may simultaneously communicate with all of its
neighbors in a single round. A basic question in this setting is how many
rounds of communication are required for the information dissemination problem,
in which each node has some piece of information and is required to collect all
others. In this paper, we give an algorithm that solves the information
dissemination problem in at most $O(D+\text{polylog}{(n)})$ rounds in a network
of diameter $D$, withno dependence on the conductance. This is at most an
additive polylogarithmic factor from the trivial lower bound of $D$, which
applies even in the LOCAL model. In fact, we prove that something stronger is
true: any algorithm that requires $T$ rounds in the LOCAL model can be
simulated in $O(T +\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ rounds in the GOSSIP model. We thus
prove that these two models of distributed computation are essentially
equivalent.

perturbation theory techniques. We extract the first measurements of the power
spectrum of the velocity divergence field, P_vv(k), as a function of redshift

bluest asymmetry tend to have greater column density than other cores and all
five cores with peak column density $> \rm 6\times 10^{21} cm^{-2}$ are found
to be contracting. This suggests that starless cores are likely to have
contracting motions if they are sufficiently condensed. Our classification of
the starless cores may indicate a sequence of core evolution in the sense that
column density increases from static to contracting cores: the static cores in
the earliest stage, the expanding and/or the oscillating cores in the next, and
the contracting cores in the latest stage.

efficiently allocate n items to n agents that each have a complete, private
preference list and a unit demand over the items. Our focus is on allocation
mechanisms that do not involve any monetary payments. We consider two natural
measures of social welfare: the ordinal welfare factor which measures the
number of agents that are at least as happy as in some unknown, arbitrary
benchmark allocation, and the linear welfare factor which assumes an agent's
utility linearly decreases down his preference lists, and measures the total
utility to that achieved by an optimal allocation. We analyze two matching
mechanisms which have been extensively studied by economists. The first
mechanism is the random serial dictatorship (RSD) where agents are ordered in
accordance with a randomly chosen permutation, and are successively allocated
their best choice among the unallocated items. The second mechanism is the
probabilistic serial (PS) mechanism of Bogomolnaia and Moulin [8], which
computes a fractional allocation that can be expressed as a convex combination
of integral allocations. The welfare factor of a mechanism is the infimum over
all instances. For RSD, we show that the ordinal welfare factor is
asymptotically 1/2, while the linear welfare factor lies in the interval [.526,
2/3]. For PS, we show that the ordinal welfare factor is also 1/2 while the
linear welfare factor is roughly 2/3. To our knowledge, these results are the
first non-trivial performance guarantees for these natural mechanisms.

measurements of near-infrared point sources indicate a well-ordered global
magnetic field that is perpendicular to the main filament, implying that the
magnetic field is likely to have controlled the formation of the main filament.
On the other hand, the sub-filaments, which converge on the central part of the
cluster, tend to run along the magnetic field. The global magnetic field
appears to be curved in the southern part of the main filament. Such morphology
is consistent with the idea that the global magnetic field is distorted by
gravitational contraction along the main filament toward the northern part that
contains larger mass. Applying the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, the magnetic
field strength is roughly estimated to be a few x 100 microgauss, suggesting
that the filamentary cloud is close to magnetically critical as a whole.

motion, due to Noether symmetries of the equations of motion, in order to
classify the dark energy models in the context of scalar field (quintessence or
phantom) FLRW cosmologies. In general, the Noether symmetries play an important
role in physics because they can be used to simplify a given system of
differential equations as well as to determine the integrability of the system.
The Noether symmetries are computed for nine distinct accelerating cosmological
scenarios that contain a homogeneous scalar field associated with different
types of potentials. We verify that all the scalar field potentials, presented
here, admit the trivial first integral namely energy conservation, as they
should. We also find that the exponential potential inspired from scalar field
cosmology, as well as some types of hyperbolic potentials, include extra
Noether symmetries. This feature suggests that these potentials should be
preferred along the hierarchy of scalar field potentials. Finally, using the
latter potentials, in the framework of either quintessence or phantom scalar
field cosmologies that contain also a non-relativistic matter(dark matter)
component, we find that the main cosmological functions, such as the scale
factor of the universe, the scalar field, the Hubble expansion rate and the
metric of the FRLW space-time, are computed analytically. Interestingly, under
specific circumstances the predictions of the exponential and hyperbolic scalar
field models are equivalent to those of the $\Lambda$CDM model, as far as the
global dynamics and the evolution of the scalar field are concerned. The
present analysis suggests that our technique appears to be very competitive to
other independent tests used to probe the functional form of a given potential
and thus the associated nature of dark energy.

Nowadays, most AFMs use micro-machined force sensors made from silicon, but
piezoelectric quartz sensors are applied at an increasing rate, mainly in
vacuum. These self sensing force sensors allow a relatively easy upgrade of a
scanning tunneling microscope to a combined scanning tunneling/atomic force
microscope. Two fundamentally different types of quartz sensors have achieved
atomic resolution: the 'needle sensor' that is based on a length extensional
resonator and the 'qPlus sensor' that is based on a tuning fork. Here, we
calculate and measure the noise characteristics of these sensors. We find four
noise sources: deflection detector noise, thermal noise, oscillator noise and
thermal drift noise. We calculate the effect of these noise sources as a factor
of sensor stiffness, bandwidth and oscillation amplitude. We find that for self
sensing quartz sensors, the deflection detector noise is independent of sensor
stiffness, while the remaining three noise sources increase strongly with
sensor stiffness. Deflection detector noise increases with bandwidth to the
power of 1.5, while thermal noise and oscillator noise are proportional to the
square root of the bandwidth. Thermal drift noise, however, is inversely
proportional to bandwidth. The first three noise sources are inversely
proportional to amplitude while thermal drift noise is independent of the
amplitude. Thus, we show that the earlier finding that quoted optimal
signal-to-noise ratio for oscillation amplitudes similar to the range of the
forces is still correct when considering all four frequency noise
contributions. Finally, we suggest how the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensors
can be further improved and briefly discuss the challenges of mounting tips.

walls in cylindrical nanowires: zero depinning current, the absence of the
Walker breakdown, and applications as domain wall oscillators. In order to
reliably control the domain wall motion, it is important to understand how they
interact with energy barriers.
  In this paper, we study the motion and depinning of transverse domain walls
through potential barriers in ferromagnetic cylindrical nanowires. We use
magnetic fields and spin-polarized currents to drive the domain walls along the
wire. Using magnetic fields, we find that the minimum and the maximum fields
required to push the domain wall through the barrier differ by 30 %. On the
contrary, using spin-polarized currents, we find variations of a factor 130
between the minimum value of the depinning current density and the maximum
value.
  We study the depinning current density as a function of the height of the
energy barrier using numerical and analytical methods. We find that, for a
barrier of 40 k_B T, a depinning current density of about 5 uA is sufficient to
depin the domain wall.
  We reveal and explain the mechanism that leads to these unusually low
depinning currents. One requirement for this new depinning mechanism is for the
domain wall to be able to rotate around its own axis. With the right barrier
design, the spin torque transfer term is acting exactly against the damping in
the micromagnetic system, and thus the low current density is sufficient to
accumulate enough energy quickly. These key insights may be crucial in
furthering the development of novel memory technologies, such as the racetrack
memory, that can be controlled through low current densities.

RCD has advantages over commonly used methods because it is robust to false

RCD does not depend on prior knowledge of splice isoforms, yet it takes
advantage of the inherent structure of mutually exclusive junctions, and it is
conceptually generalizable to other types of splicing arrays or RNA-Seq. RCD
specifically identifies the biologically important cases when a splice junction

Universit\""at W\""urzburg",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The standard model (SM) of particle physics is for the last three decades a
very successful description of the properties and interactions of all known
elementary particles. Currently, it is again probed with the first collisions
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is widely expected that new physics will
be detected at the LHC and the SM has to be extended. The most exhaustive
analyzed extension of the SM is supersymmetry (SUSY). SUSY can not only solve
intrinsic problems of the SM like the hierarchy problem, but it also postulates
new particles which might explain the nature of dark matter in the universe.
The majority of all studies about dark matter in the framework of SUSY has
focused on the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The aim of this
work is to consider scenarios beyond that scope. We consider two models which
explain not only dark matter but also neutrino masses: the gravitino as dark
matter in gauge mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) with bilinear broken R-parity as
well as different seesaw scenarios with the neutralino as dark matter
candidate. Furthermore, we also study the next-to-minimal supersymmetric
standard model (NMSSM) which solves the (\mu)-problem of the MSSM and discuss
the properties of the neutralino as dark matter candidate.

chemical reactions on surface systems have recently gained much attention. In
the present paper, we consider such an issue by investigating the oscillation
behavior of a two-dimension (2D) lattice-gas Brusselator model. We have adopted
a coarse-grained Kinetic Monte Carlo (CG-KMC) procedure, where $m \times m$
microscopic lattice sites are grouped together to form a CG cell, upon which CG
processes take place with well-defined CG rates. We find that, however, such a
CG approach almost fails if the CG rates are obtained by a simple local mean
field ($s$-LMF) approximation, due to the ignorance of correlation among
adjcent cells resulted from the trimolecular reaction in this nonlinear system.
By properly incorporating such boundary effects, we thus introduce the
so-called $b$-LMF CG approach. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that
the $b$-LMF method can reproduce the oscillation behavior of the system quite
well, given that the diffusion constant is not too small. In addition, we find
that the deviation from the KMC results reaches a nearly zero minimum level at
an intermediate cell size, which lies in between the effective diffusion length
and the minimal size required to sustain a well-defined temporal oscillation.

the chemical Langevin equations, we are able to calculate the stochastic
entropy production P along a random trajectory in the concentration state
space. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of the time averaged
entropy productionP on the system sizeN in a parameter region close to the
deterministic Hopf bifurcation.In the large system size (weak noise) limit, we
find that P N^{\beta} with {\beta}=0 or 1 when the system is below or abovethe
Hopf bifurcation, respectively. In the small system size (strong noise) limit,
P always increases linearly with N regardless of the bifurcation parameter.
More interestingly,P could even reach a maximum for some intermediate system
size in a parameter region where the corresponding deterministic system shows
steady state or small amplitude oscillation. The maximum value of P decreases
as the system parameter approaches the so-called CANARD point where the maximum
disappears.This phenomenon could be qualitativelyunderstood by partitioning the
total entropy production into the contributions of spikes and of small
amplitude oscillations.

stores her data $x$ on a remote server but wants to audit the server at some
later point to make sure it actually did store $x$. The goal is to design a
(randomized) verification protocol that has the property that if the server
passes the verification with some reasonably high probability then the user can
rest assured that the server is storing $x$.
  In this work we present an optimal solution (in terms of the user's storage
and communication) while at the same time ensuring that a server that passes
the verification protocol with any reasonable probability will store, to within
a small \textit{additive} factor, $C(x)$ bits of information, where $C(x)$ is
the plain Kolmogorov complexity of $x$. (Since we cannot prevent the server
from compressing $x$, $C(x)$ is a natural upper bound.) The proof of security
of our protocol combines Kolmogorov complexity with list decoding and unlike
previous work that relies upon cryptographic assumptions, we allow the server
to have unlimited computational power. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that combines Kolmogorov complexity and list decoding.
  Our framework is general enough to capture extensions where the user splits
up $x$ and stores the fragment across multiple servers and our verification
protocol can handle non-responsive servers and colluding servers. As a
by-product, we also get a proof of retrievability. Finally, our results also
have an application in `storage enforcement' schemes, which in turn have an
application in trying to update a remote server that is potentially infected

observations above (on type Ia supernovae, the gamma ray bursts Hubble diagram,

as $v_{2}$ is expected to be sensitive to the initial conditions, the expansion
dynamics and the degrees of freedom of the system, all of which potentially
varies with collision system and colliding energies. We present a study of the
longitudinal scalings of $dN_{\mathrm {ch}}/d\eta$, average transverse momentum

longitudinal scaling only for $dN_{\mathrm {ch}}/d\eta$ and $<p_{\mathrm T}>$.
We also discuss the possibility of longitudinal scaling of $v_{2}$ within two
extreme scenarios of models with hydrodynamic and collisionless limits. We find
the longitudinal scaling of bulk observables to be an important test for the

structure, and the choice of data structure depends on the arithmetic
operations that are to be performed. Numbers are almost universally represented
using position based notations based on exponential powers of a base number -
usually 10. This representations is computationally efficient for the standard
arithmetic operations, but it is not efficient for factorisation. This has led
to a common confusion that factorisation is inherently computationally hard. We
propose a new representation of the natural numbers based on bags and using the
prime successor function as a primitive - prime bags (PBs). This data structure
is more efficient for most arithmetic operations, and enables numbers can be
efficiently factored. However, it also has the interesting feature that
addition appears to be computationally hard. PBs have an interesting
alternative interpretation as partitions of numbers represented in the standard
way, and this reveals a novel relationship between prime numbers and the
partition function. The PB representation can be extended to rational and
irrational numbers, and this provides the most direct proof of the
irrationality of the square root of 2. I argue that what needs to be ultimately
understood is not the peculiar computation complexity properties of the decimal
system (e.g. factorisation), but rather what arithmetical operator trade-offs
are generally possible.

optical and acoustical sensors inside one module, therefore reducing

color branes and D8 flavor branes in type IIA string theory is used to
investigate the role of topological charge in the chiral dynamics of quarks in
QCD. The QCD theta term arises from a compactified 5-dimensional Chern-Simons
term on the D4 branes. This term couples the QCD topological charge to the
Ramond-Ramond $U(1)$ gauge field of IIA string theory. The nonzero topological
susceptibility of pure-glue QCD can be attributed to the presence of D6 branes,
which constitute magnetic sources of the RR gauge field. The topological charge
of QCD is required, by an anomaly inflow argument, to coincide in space-time
with the intersection of the D6 branes and the D4 color branes. This clarifies
the relation between D6 branes and the coherent, codimension-one topological
charge membranes observed in QCD Monte Carlo calculations. Using
open-string/closed-string duality, we interpret a quark loop (represented by a
D4-D8 open string loop) in terms of closed-string exchange between color and
flavor branes. The role of the RR gauge field in quark-antiquark annihilation
processes is discussed. RR exchange in the s-channel generates a 4-quark
contact term which produces an $\eta'$ mass insertion and provides an
explanation for the observed spin-parity structure of the OZI rule. The $(\log
{\rm Det\;U})^2$ form of the $U(1)$ anomaly emerges naturally. RR exchange in
the t-channel of the $q\overline{q}$ scattering amplitude produces a Nambu-Jona
Lasinio interaction which may provide a mechanism for spontaneous breaking of
$SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$.

are found within its bulge. Because of high interstellar extinction along the
line of sight many novae lying close to the plane are missed and only the
brightest seen. One nova lying very close to the Galactic plane is V1721
Aquilae, discovered in outburst on 2008 September 22. Spectra obtained 2.69
days after outburst revealed very high expansion velocities (FWHM ~6450 km/s).
In this paper we have used available pre- and post-outburst photometry and
post-outburst spectroscopy to conclude that the object is a very fast,
luminous, and highly extinguished A_V=11.6+/-0.2) nova system with an average
ejection velocity of ~3400 km/s. Pre-outburst near-IR colours from 2MASS
indicate that at quiescence the object is similar to many quiescent CNe and
appears to have a main sequence/sub-giant secondary rather than a giant. Based
on the speed of decline of the nova and its emission line profiles we
hypothesise that the axis ratio of the nova ejecta is ~1.4 and that its
inclination is such that the central binary accretion disc is face-on to the
observer. The accretion disc's blue contribution to the system's near-IR
quiescent colours may be significant. Simple models of the nova ejecta have
been constructed using the morphological modelling code XS5, and the results
support the above hypothesis. Spectral classification of this object has been
difficult owing to low S/N levels and high extinction, which has eliminated all
evidence of any He/N or FeII emission within the spectra. We suggest two
possibilities for the nature of V1721 Aql: that it is a U Sco type RN with a
sub-giant secondary or, less likely, that it is a highly energetic bright and
fast classical nova with a main sequence secondary. Future monitoring of the
object for possible RN episodes may be worthwhile, as would archival searches
for previous outbursts.

and independent of the data size, since it makes use of the barycentric formula
for obtaining the values of the cost function and its derivatives. Thus, the
total complexity order is that of the FFT. The method is validated in a

history. However, with regard to this objective, conventional estimation
methods for discrete-time dynamical models are frequently found to be wanting.
In fact, they are characteristically misguided in at least two respects: (i)
assuming that there is a true model; (ii) evaluating the efficacy of the
estimation as if the postulated model is true. There are numerous examples of
models, when fitted by conventional methods, that fail to capture some of the
most basic global features of the data, such as cycles with good matching
periods, singularities of spectral density functions (especially at the origin)
and others. We argue that the shortcomings need not always be due to the model
formulation but the inadequacy of the conventional fitting methods. After all,
all models are wrong, but some are useful if they are fitted properly. The
practical issue becomes one of how to best fit the model to data. Thus, in the
absence of a true model, we prefer an alternative approach to conventional
model fitting that typically involves one-step-ahead prediction errors. Our
primary aim is to match the joint probability distribution of the observable
time series, including long-term features of the dynamics that underpin the
data, such as cycles, long memory and others, rather than short-term
prediction. For want of a better name, we call this specific aim feature
matching.

arguments is intuitionistic and we use L.E.J.~Brouwer's Thesis on bars in

complement of a subset of $\mathcal{N}$.
  A subset of $\mathcal{N}$ is $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1$ or: analytic if it is the
projection of a closed subset of $\mathcal{N}$. Important $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1$
set are the set of the codes of all closed and located subsets of $\mathcal{N}$
that are positively uncountable and the set of the codes of all located and
closed subsets of $\mathcal{N}$ containing at least one member coding a
(positively) infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}$. A subset of $\mathcal{N}$ is
strictly analytic if it is the projection of a closed and located subset of
$\mathcal{N}$. Brouwer's Thesis on bars in $\mathcal{N}$ proves separation and
boundedness theorems for strictly analytic subsets of $\mathcal{N}$.
  A subset of $\mathcal{N}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1$ or: co-analytic if it is the
co-projection of an open subset of $\mathcal{N} \times

sets like in classical descriptive set theory. An important $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1$
set is the set of the codes of all closed and located subsets of $\mathcal{N}$
all of whose members code an almost-finite subset of $\mathbb{N}$.
  The set of the codes of closed and located subsets of $\mathcal{N}$ that are
almost-countable, or, equivalently, \{reducible in Cantor's sense, is treated
at some length. This set is probably not $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1$.
  The projective hierarchy collapses: every (positively) projective set is
$\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$: the projection of a co-analytic subset of $\mathcal{N}$.

to a constant factor. However, it is unclear what is meant exactly by
""resolution-limit-free"", that is, not suffering from the resolution limit.
Furthermore, the question remains what other methods could be classified as

derive some basic properties of resolution-limit-free methods. More
importantly, we are able to prove exactly which class of community detection

one-dimensional colored range reporting problem in rank space. The goal is to
build a static data structure for sets C_1,...,C_m \subseteq {1,...,sigma} that
supports queries of the kind: Given indices a,b, report the set Union_{a <= i
<= b} C_i.
  We study the problem in the I/O model, and show that there exists an optimal
linear-space data structure that answers queries in O(1+k/B) I/Os, where k
denotes the output size and B the disk block size in words. In fact, we obtain
the same bound for the harder problem of three-sided orthogonal range
reporting. In this problem, we are to preprocess a set of n two-dimensional
points in rank space, such that all points inside a query rectangle of the form
[x_1,x_2] x (-infinity,y] can be reported. The best previous bounds for this
problem is either O(n lg^2_B n) space and O(1+k/B) query I/Os, or O(n) space
and O(lg^(h)_B n +k/B) query I/Os, where lg^(h)_B n is the base B logarithm
iterated h times, for any constant integer h. The previous bounds are both
achieved under the indivisibility assumption, while our solution exploits the
full capabilities of the underlying machine. Breaking the indivisibility
assumption thus provides us with cleaner and optimal bounds.
  Our results also imply an optimal solution to the following colored prefix
reporting problem. Given a set S of strings, each O(1) disk blocks in length,
and a function c: S -> 2^{1,...,sigma}, support queries of the kind: Given a
string p, report the set Union_{x in S intersection p*} c(x), where p* denotes
the set of strings with prefix p. Finally, we consider the possibility of top-k
extensions of this result, and present a simple solution in a model that allows
non-blocked I/O.
