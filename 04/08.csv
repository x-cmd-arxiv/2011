designed to search for inflationary gravitational waves, and investigate the
impact of residual foregrounds that remain in the estimated cosmic microwave
background maps. This is achieved by propagating foreground modelling
uncertainties from the component separation, under the assumption of a
spatially uniform foreground frequency scaling, through to the power spectrum
estimates, and up to measurement of the tensor to scalar ratio in the parameter
estimation step. We characterize the error covariance due to subtracted
foregrounds, and find it to be subdominant compared to instrumental noise and
sample variance in our simulated data analysis. We model the unsubtracted
residual foreground contribution using a two-parameter power law and show that
marginalization over these foreground parameters is effective in accounting for
a bias due to excess foreground power at low $\ell$. We conclude that, at least
in the suborbital experimental setups we have simulated, foreground errors may
be modeled and propagated up to parameter estimation with only a slight
degradation of the target sensitivity of these experiments derived neglecting
the presence of the foregrounds.

fracture zones and faults, derived from the analysis of the corresponding
earth's gravity field; to the current seismic potential map determined from the
study of the past seismicity, while its time of occurrence is compared to the
peaks of the M1 and diurnal tidal waves. The detailed investigation of the
earth's electric field that was recorded by the ATH monitoring site, located in
Athens, revealed the presence of short train like pulses type electric seismic
precursory signals which were generated short (1 - 2 days) before the EQ
occurrence time. Moreover, the analysis (for T = 1 day) of the earth's
oscillating electric field, that was simultaneously recorded at PYR and ATH

precursor preceded for 1 - 2 days the EQ occurrence time. A similar behavior
was observed from the large EQ of the East Kythira (Ms = 6.9R, January, 8th,

compared with what is expected: often, what is expected from a theory of the
system's microscopic constituents. We take reduction as deduction, aided by
appropriate definitions. Then the main idea of our reconciliation of emergence
and reduction is that one makes the deduction after taking a limit of an
appropriate parameter $N$. Thus our first main claim will be that in some
situations, one can deduce a novel behaviour, by taking a limit $N\to\infty$.
Our main illustration of this will be Lee-Yang theory. But on the other hand,
this does not show that the $N=\infty$ limit is physically real. For our second
main claim will be that in such situations, there is a logically weaker, yet
still vivid, novel behaviour that occurs before the limit, i.e. for finite $N$.
And it is this weaker behaviour which is physically real. Our main illustration
of this will be the renormalization group description of cross-over phenomena.

sequence stars in the mid-infrared, in order to assess the prevalence of warm
circumstellar (exozodiacal) dust around nearby solar-type stars. The KIN
measures circumstellar emission by spatially blocking the star but transmitting
the circumstellar flux in a region typically 0.1 - 4 AU from the star. We find
one significant detection (eta Crv), two marginal detections (gamma Oph and
alpha Aql), and 22 clear non-detections. Using a model of our own Solar
System's zodiacal cloud, scaled to the luminosity of each target star, we
estimate the equivalent number of target zodis needed to match our
observations. Our three zodi detections are eta Crv (1250 +/- 260), gamma Oph
(200 +/- 80) and alpha Aql (600 +/- 200), where the uncertainties are 1-sigma.
The 22 non-detected targets have an ensemble weighted average consistent with
zero, with an average individual uncertainty of 160 zodis (1-sigma). These
measurements represent the best limits to date on exozodi levels for a sample
of nearby main sequence stars. A statistical analysis of the population of 23
stars not previously known to contain circumstellar dust (excluding eta Crv and
gamma Oph) suggests that, if the measurement errors are uncorrelated (for which
we provide evidence) and if these 23 stars are representative of a single class
with respect to the level of exozodi brightness, the mean exozodi level for the
class is <150 zodis (3-sigma upper-limit, corresponding to 99% confidence under
the additional assumption that the measurement errors are Gaussian). We also
demonstrate that this conclusion is largely independent of the shape and mean
level of the (unknown) true underlying exozodi distribution.

elliptical and rectangular shapes. We compare the phase diagram topologies and
explain their main features from the entropic nature of particle interactions
directly related to the anisotropies, areas, and shapes of species. The results
obtained can be corroborated by experiments on granular rods where the entropic
forces are very important in the stabilization of liquid-crystal textures at
the stationary states.

consider a scenario where the lightest and the second-lightest neutralino are

resonant leptogenesis. In this model, the lighter chargino and the lightest

invariance under transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff), which are the 4-volume
conserving coordinate transformations. We show that these theories are
equivalent to a specific type of scalar-tensor theories of gravity (invariant
under all diffeomorphisms) with a number of properties, making them
phenomenologically interesting. They contain, in addition to the dimensionless
coupling constants of the original theory, an arbitrary dimensionful parameter
$\Lambda_0$. This parameter is associated with an integration constant of the
equations of motion, similar to the arbitrary cosmological constant appearing
in unimodular gravity. We focus on the theories where Newton's constant and the
electroweak scale emerge from the spontaneous breaking of scale invariance and
are unrelated to $\Lambda_0$. The massless particle spectrum of these theories
contains the graviton and a new particle -- dilaton. For $\Lambda_0=0$, the
massless dilaton has only derivative couplings to matter fields and the bounds
on the existence of a 5th force are easily satisfied. As for the matter fields,
we determine the conditions leading to a renormalizable low-energy theory. If
$\Lambda_0\neq 0$, scale invariance is broken. The arbitrary constant
$\Lambda_0$ produces a ""run-away"" potential for the dilaton. As a consequence,
the dilaton can act as a dynamical dark energy component. We elucidate the
origin of the cosmological constant in the class of theories under
consideration and formulate the condition leading to its absence. If this
condition is satisfied, dark energy is purely dynamical and associated to the
dilaton.

We find that optimised Box-Cox transformations perform substantially better
than an offset logarithmic transformation in Gaussianising the convergence, but
both yield very similar results for the signal-to-noise and parameter
constraints. None of the transformations is capable of eliminating correlations
of the power spectra between different angular frequencies, which we
demonstrate to have a significant impact on the errors on cosmology. Analytic
models of the Gaussianised power spectrum yield good fits to the simulations
and produce unbiased parameter estimates in the majority of cases, where the
exceptions can be traced back to the limitations in modelling the higher-order
correlations of the original convergence. In the idealistic case, without
galaxy shape noise, we find an increase in cumulative signal-to-noise by a
factor of 2.6 for angular frequencies up to 1500, and a decrease in the area of
the confidence region in the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane by a factor of 4.4 in terms
of q-values for the best-performing transformation. When adding a realistic
level of shape noise, all transformations perform poorly with little
decorrelation of angular frequencies, a maximum increase in signal-to-noise of
34%, and even marginally degraded errors on cosmological parameters. We argue
that, to find Gaussianising transformations of practical use, one will need to
go beyond transformations of the one-point distribution of the convergence,
extend the analysis deeper into the non-linear regime, and resort to an
exploration of parameter space via simulations. (abridged)

that a combined analysis of both the multiband, non-stationary dynamics in the

explains important characteristics of optical lattice collapse-and-revival

embeddings at zero temperature, we find an infinite set of threshold values of
the chemical potential at which instabilities are triggered. The onset of
instability is always preceded by metastability of the zero density state. From
the onset values of the chemical potential, we infer that unstable directions
favour a homogeneous condensate of a bilinear made from fermion harmonics, or
Cooper pairing. We confirm this picture both numerically and analytically. The
linearized analysis showing the appearance of instabilities involves a charged
scalar in global AdS space coupled to a (large) constant background gauge
potential. The resulting frequency space correlator of the fermion bilinear at
strong coupling displays poles in the upper half plane. In contrast, the
correlator at zero coupling exhibits Pauli blocking due to occupation of states
below the Fermi level, but no instabilities. The end-point of the strong
coupling instability is not visible in our setup.

to the standard relativistic Navier-Stokes fluid mechanics in the long time

short time scales is modified from that given by the Navier-Stokes equations,
so that acausal problems intrinsic to relativistic Navier-Stokes fluids are
significantly remedied. We in particular show that the wave equations for the
propagation of disturbance around a hydrostatic equilibrium in Minkowski
spacetime become symmetric hyperbolic for some range of parameters, so that the
model is free of acausality problems. This observation suggests that the
relativistic viscoelastic model with such parameters can be regarded as a
causal completion of relativistic Navier-Stokes fluid mechanics. By adjusting
parameters to various values, this theory can treat a wide variety of materials
including elastic materials, Maxwell materials, Kelvin-Voigt materials, and (a
nonlinearly generalized version of) simplified Israel-Stewart fluids, and thus
we expect the theory to be the most universal description of single-component
relativistic continuum materials. We also show that the presence of strains and
the corresponding change in temperature are naturally unified through the
Tolman law in a generally covariant description of continuum mechanics.

ECHOS are systematically more iron-rich, but less alpha-enhanced than the
kinematically-smooth component of the inner halo. ECHOS are also chemically
distinct from other Milky Way components: more iron-poor than typical
thick-disk stars and both more iron-poor and alpha-enhanced than typical
thin-disk stars. In addition, the radial velocity dispersion distribution of
ECHOS extends beyond sigma ~ 20 km s^-1. Globular clusters are unlikely ECHOS
progenitors, as ECHOS have large velocity dispersions and are found in a region
of the Galaxy in which iron-rich globular clusters are very rare. Likewise, the
chemical composition of stars in ECHOS do not match predictions for stars
formed in the Milky Way and subsequently scattered into the inner halo. Dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are possible ECHOS progenitors, and if ECHOS are
formed through the tidal disruption of one or more dSph galaxies, the typical

dSph with M_tot >~ 10^9 M_Sun. Our observations confirm the predictions of
theoretical models of Milky Way halo formation that suggest that prominent
substructures are likely to be metal-rich, and our result implies that the most
likely metallicity for a recently accreted star currently in the inner halo is

galaxies with low star formation rates are preferentially found in dense
environments -- is still in place at z~1, but the situation becomes less clear
at higher redshifts. We use mass-selected samples drawn from the UKIDSS
Ultra-Deep Survey to show that galaxies with quenched star formation tend to
reside in dense environments out to at least z~1.8. Over most of this redshift
range we are able to demonstrate that this star formation-density relation
holds even at fixed stellar mass. The environmental quenching of star formation
appears to operate with similar efficiency on all galaxies regardless of
stellar mass. Nevertheless, the environment plays a greater role in the
build-up of the red sequence at lower masses, whereas other quenching processes
dominate at higher masses. In addition to a statistical analysis of
environmental densities, we investigate a cluster at z=1.6, and show that the
central region has an elevated fraction of quiescent objects relative to the
field. Although the uncertainties are large, the environmental quenching
efficiency in this cluster is consistent with that of galaxy groups and
clusters at z~0. In this work we rely on photometric redshifts, and describe
some of the pitfalls that large redshift errors can present.

produced by aqueous alteration of primordial anhydrous rocky materials. The
dust and, by inference, the parent bodies of the debris also contain abundant
amorphous silicates and metal sulfides, and possibly water ice. The dust's

for a case of the meridional circulation with a deep-seated stagnation point
and a strong return flow at the bottom of the convection zone. This kind of
circulation follows from mean-field models of the angular momentum balance in
the solar convection zone. We show that it is possible for this types of
meridional circulation to construct kinematic dynamo models that resemble in
some aspects the sunspot magnetic activity cycle. The dynamo model includes
turbulent sources of the large-scale poloidal magnetic field production, due to
kinetic helicity and a combined effect due to Coriolis force and the
large-scale current. In these models the toroidal magnetic field, which is
responsible for the sunspot production, is concentrated at the bottom of the
convection zone, and is transported to low-latitude regions by the meridional
flow. The meridional component of the poloidal field is also concentrated at
the bottom of the convection zone while the radial component is concentrated in
near polar regions. There are some issues which, perhaps, are resulted from the
given meridional circulation pattern and the distribution of the magnetic
diffusivity inside convection zone. In particular, in the near-equatorial
regions the phase relations between the toroidal and poloidal components
disagree with observations. Also, we show that the period of the magnetic cycle
may not always monotonically decrease with the increase of the meridional flow
speed. Thus, for the further progress it is important to determine the
structure of the meridional circulation, which is one of the critical
properties, from helioseismology observations.

luminosities of galaxies and their existing HI data. We have found that our
Hercules SF galaxies divide into three main subgroups: a) chemically evolved
spirals with truncated ionized-gas disks and nearly flat oxygen gradients,
witnessing the effect of ram-pressure stripping, b) chemically evolved
dwarfs/irregulars populating the highest local densities, possible products of
tidal interactions in preprocessing events, or c) less metallic dwarf galaxies
which appear to be ""newcomers"" to the cluster, experiencing pressure-triggered
star-formation. Most Hercules SF galaxies follow well defined MZ and LZ
sequences (for both O/H and N/O); though the dwarf/irregular galaxies located
at the densest regions appear to be outliers to these global relations,
suggesting a physical reason for the dispersion in these fundamental relations.
The Hercules cluster appears to be currently assembling via the merger of
smaller substructures, providing an ideal laboratory where the local
environment has been found to be a key parameter to understand the chemical

notoriously spans a broad range of spatial scales. Phenomenological theories of
MHD turbulence describe the self-similar dynamics of turbulent fluctuations in
the inertial range of scales. Numerical simulations serve to guide and test
these theories. However, the computational power that is currently available
restricts the simulations to Reynolds numbers that are significantly smaller
than those in astrophysical settings. In order to increase computational
efficiency and, therefore, probe a larger range of scales, one often takes into
account the fundamental anisotropy of field-guided MHD turbulence, with
gradients being much slower in the field-parallel direction. The simulations
are then optimised by employing the reduced MHD equations and relaxing the
field-parallel numerical resolution. In this work we explore a different
possibility. We propose that there exist certain quantities that are remarkably
stable with respect to the Reynolds number. As an illustration, we study the
alignment angle between the magnetic and velocity fluctuations in MHD
turbulence, measured as the ratio of two specially constructed structure
functions. We find that the scaling of this ratio can be extended surprisingly
well into the regime of relatively low Reynolds number. However, the extended
scaling becomes easily spoiled when the dissipation range in the simulations is
under-resolved. Thus, taking the numerical optimisation methods too far can
lead to spurious numerical effects and erroneous representation of the physics
of MHD turbulence, which in turn can affect our ability to correctly identify
the physical mechanisms that are operating astrophysical systems.

w_a=-0.984+1.094-1.097 in a flat universe. All of our results are consistent
with a flat, w=-1 universe. The size of the SNLS3 sample allows various tests
to be performed with the SNe segregated according to their light curve and host
galaxy properties. We find that the cosmological constraints derived from these
different sub-samples are consistent. There is evidence that the coefficient,
beta, relating SN Ia luminosity and color, varies with host parameters at
>4sigma significance (in addition to the known SN luminosity--host relation);
however this has only a small effect on the cosmological results and is
currently a sub-dominant systematic.

(BF) as contrasted with MIMO to see how both emerge and under which conditions
advantage goes to one or the other. Communication is from a high base array to
a user in clutter. The channel propagation model is derived from fundamentals.
The base knows the power angular spectrum, but not the channel instantiation.
Eigenstates of the field spatial autocorrelation are the preferred apodizations
(APODs) which are drivers of the natural modes for exciting lectric fields.
Preference for MIMO or BF depends on APOD spectra which are surveyed pointing
to various asymptotic effects, including the maximum BF gain. Performance is
studied under varying eigenmode power settings at 10% outage. We focus on (1,4)
driving the strongest mode for BF and (4,4) driving the 4 strongest for MIMO.
Results are obtained under representative parameter settings, e.g. an angular
spread of 8 deg, 2 GHz carrier, 0 dB SNR and an array aperture of 1.68m (4
field decorrelation lengths) with antenna elements spaced as close as lambda/2.
We find MIMO excelling for array apertures much larger than the decorrelation
length; BF does almost as well for smaller apertures.

shift thought previously to be purely quantum. The only quantum result used

Hilbert modules, in particular the Baker and tau-functions, which become
operator-valued. Following from Part I we produce a pre-determinant structure
for a class of tau-functions defined in the setting of the similarity class of
projections of a certain Banach *-algebra. This structure is explicitly derived
from the transition map of a corresponding principal bundle. The determinant of
this map gives a generalized, operator-valued tau-function that takes values in
a commutative C*-algebra. We extend to this setting the operator cross-ratio
which had been used to produce the scalar-valued tau-function, as well as the
associated notion of a Schwarzian derivative along curves inside the space of
similarity classes. We link directly this cross-ratio with Fay's trisecant
identity for the tau-function (equivalent to the KP hierarchy). By restriction
to the image of the Krichever map, we use the Schwarzian to introduce the
notion of operator-valued projective structure on a compact Riemann surface:
this allows a deformation inside the Grassmannian (as it varies its complex
structure). Lastly, we use our identification of the Jacobian of the Riemann
surface in terms of extensions of the Burchnall-Chaundy C*-algebra (Part I) to
describe the KP hierarchy.

phases when the stars are surrounded by discs, the binary orbit and disc
midplane may be mutually inclined. The discs around T Tauri stars will become
mildly warped and undergo solid body precession around the angular momentum
vector of the binary system. It is unclear how planetesimals in such a disc
will evolve and affect planet formation. Aims. We investigate the dynamics of
planetesimals embedded in discs that are perturbed by a binary companion on a
circular, inclined orbit. We examine collisional velocities of the
planetesimals to determine when they can grow through accretion. We vary the
binary inclination, binary separation, D, disc mass, and planetesimal radius.
Our standard model has D=60 AU, inclination=45 deg, and a disc mass equivalent
to the MMSN. Methods. We use a 3D hydrodynamics code to model the disc.
Planetesimals are test particles which experience gas drag, the gravitational
force of the disc, the companion star gravity. Planetesimal orbit crossing
events are detected and used to estimate collisional velocities. Results. For
binary systems with modest inclination (25 deg), disc gravity prevents
planetesimal orbits from undergoing strong differential nodal precession (which
occurs in absence of the disc), and forces planetesimals to precess with the
disc on average. For bodies of different size the orbit planes become modestly
mutually inclined, leading to collisional velocities that inhibit growth. For
larger inclinations (45 degrees), the Kozai effect operates, leading to
destructively large relative velocities. Conclusions. Planet formation via
planetesimal accretion is difficult in an inclined binary system with
parameters similar to those considered in this paper. For systems in which the
Kozai mechanism operates, the prospects for forming planets are very remote.

for the intrinsic spin part of gluons at the quantum level. In fact, it was
sometimes claimed that the evolution of gluon spin depends on the gauge choice
and its physical interpretation makes sense only in the light-cone gauge. In
the present paper, we will demonstrate explicitly that the gluon spin operator
appearing in our decomposition evolves gauge-independently and that it properly
reproduces the familiar evolution equation for the 1st moments of polarized

terminates at a surface, and can be present in many systems. Despite their
spatial proximity to material surfaces, surface states have been largely
overlooked in fundamental understanding of surface catalysis and potential
real-world applications, because of their vulnerability to local impurities or
defects. In contrast, the recently discovered three-dimensional topological
insulators (3DTI) have exceptionally robust metallic surface states that are
topologically protected against surface contamination and imperfection. The
robust topological surface state(s) (TSS) provides a perfect platform for
exploiting novel physical phenomena and potential applications of surface
states in less stringent environments. Here we employ first-principles density
functional theory to demonstrate that the TSS can play a vital and elegant role
in facilitating surface reactions by serving as an effective electron bath. We
use CO oxidation on gold-covered Bi2Se3 as a prototype example, and first show
that the TSS is preserved when a stable ultrathin Au film is deposited onto a
Bi-terminated Bi2Se3 substrate. Furthermore, the TSS can significantly enhance
the adsorption energy of both CO and O2 molecules, by promoting different
directions of electron transfer. For CO, the TSS accepts electrons from the
CO-Au system, thereby decreasing the undesirable occupation of the CO
antibonding states. For O2, the TSS donates the needed electrons to promote the
molecule towards dissociative adsorption. The present study adds a new arena to
the technological potentials of 3DTI, and the central concept of TSS as an
electron bath as revealed here may lead to new design principles beyond the
conventional d-band theory of heterogeneous catalysis.

most existing upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performance
of the binary linear codes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.
Firstly, the recently proposed union bound using truncated weight spectrums by
Ma {\em et al} is re-derived in a detailed way based on Gallager's first
bounding technique (GFBT), where the ""good region"" is specified by a
sub-optimal list decoding algorithm. The error probability caused by the bad
region can be upper-bounded by the tail-probability of a binomial distribution,
while the error probability caused by the good region can be upper-bounded by
most existing techniques. Secondly, we propose two techniques to tighten the
union bound on the error probability caused by the good region. The first
technique is based on pair-wise error probabilities, which can be further
tightened by employing the independence between the error events and certain
components of the received random vectors. The second technique is based on
triplet-wise error probabilities, which can be upper-bounded by proving that
any three bipolar vectors form a non-obtuse triangle. The proposed bounds
improve the conventional union bounds but have a similar complexity since they
involve only the $Q$-function. The proposed bounds can also be adapted to
bit-error probabilities.

investigate the intermediate stages - from planetesimals to planetary
embryos/cores - of planet formation in such highly inclined cases. Our focus is
on the effects of gas drag on the planetesimals' orbital evolution, in
particular on the evolution of the planetesimals' semimajor axis distribution
and their mutual relative velocities. We first demonstrate that a non-evolving
axisymmetric disk model is a good approximation for studying the effects of gas
drag on a planetesimal in the highly inclined case ($30^\circ <i_B<150^\circ$).
We then find that gas drag plays a crucial role, and the results can be
generally divided into two categories, i.e., the Kozai-on regime and the
Kozai-off regime, depending on the specific value of $i_B$. For both regimes, a
robust outcome over a wide range of parameters is that, planetesimals
migrate/jump inwards and pile up, leading to a severely truncated and dense
planetesimal disk around the primary. In this compact and dense disk, collision
rates are high but relative velocities are low, providing conditions which are
favorable for planetesimal growth, and potentially allow for the subsequent
formation of planets.

explicit diagonalization) states that $c(C(n)) = \prod_{k=2}^n (2k)^{n\choose

  In this paper we use the explicit block diagonalization methodology to derive
formulas for the complexity of two $q$-analogs of C(n), the {\em nonbinary
hypercube} $\Cq(n)$, defined for $q\geq 2$, and the {\em vector space analog of

show the existence, in both cases, of a graded Jordan basis (with respect to
the up operator) that is orthogonal (with respect to the standard inner
product) and we write down explicit formulas for the ratio of the lengths of
the successive vectors in the Jordan chains (i.e., the singular values). With
respect to (the normalizations of) these bases the Laplacians of $\Cq(n)$ and
$\Cfq(n)$ block diagonalize, with quadratically many distinct blocks in the
nonbinary case and linearly many distinct blocks in the vector space case, and
with each block an explicitly written down real, symmetric, tridiagonal matrix
of known multiplicity and size at most $n+1$. In the nonbinary case we further
determine the eigenvalues of the blocks, by explicitly writing out the
eigenvectors, yielding an explicit formula for $c(\Cq(n))$ (this proof yields
new information even in the binary case). In the vector space case we have been
unable to determine the eigenvalues of the blocks but we give a useful formula
for $c(\Cfq(n))$ involving ""small"" determinants (of size at most $n$).

determined. By carefully relating the two-point functions of the field theory

point out the essential differences with a purely passive layered medium. For a
single layer, we find different bounds on the Casimir force for fully

the medium exhibits negative refraction. From our Lagrangian we also derive by
canonical quantization the postulates of the phenomenological theory of
amplifying magnetodielectrics.

biofeedback-no biofeedback transition trial and a no biofeedback-biofeedback
transition trial. The auditory biofeedback produced a low- or high-pitched
sound when participants produced an isometric force lower or higher than
required, respectively. To achieve this goal, 16 participants were asked to
produce and maintain two different isometric forces (30$\pm$5% and 90N$\pm$5%)
during 25s. Constant error and standard deviation of the isometric force were
calculated. While accuracy and variability of the isometric force varied
according to the transition trial, a drift of the force appeared in the no
biofeedback condition. This result suggested that the degradation of
information about force output in the no biofeedback condition was provided by
a leaky memory buffer which was mainly dependent on the sense of effort.
Because this drift remained constant whatever the transition used, this memory
buffer seemed to be independent of short-term memory processes.

them attractive for such applications, their confinement length scale,

highest hole velocities, whereas the (100) surfaces the lowest velocities,
almost 30% lower than the best performers. Additionally, up to 35% velocity
enhancements can be achieved as the thickness of the (110) or (112) surfaces is
scaled down to 3nm. This originates from strong increase in the curvature of
the p-type UTB film subbands with confinement, unlike the case of n-type UTB

offering a further enhancement. In this work the atomistic

electronic structure of silicon nanowires (NWs). The linearized Boltzmann
transport theory is applied, including all relevant scattering mechanisms, to
calculate the electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the
thermoelectric power factor. We examine n-type nanowires of diameters of 3nm
and 12nm, in [100], [110], and [111] transport orientations at different
carrier concentrations. Using experimental values for the lattice thermal
conductivity in nanowires, the expected ZT value is computed. We find that at
room temperature, although scaling the diameter below 7nm can be beneficial to
the power factor due to banstructure changes alone, at those dimensions
enhanced phonon and surface roughness scattering degrades the conductivity and
reduces the power factor.

often above observational limits. Aims: We investigate the reason for this
discrepancy from a theoretical point of view, inspired by the studies of
Jenkins and Whittet on oxygen depletion. Methods: We use the gas-grain code
Nautilus with an up-to-date gas-phase network to study the sensitivity of the
molecular oxygen abundance to the oxygen elemental abundance. We use the rate
coefficient for the reaction O + OH at 10 K recommended by the KIDA (KInetic
Database for Astrochemistry) experts. Results: The updates of rate coefficients
and branching ratios of the reactions of our gas-phase chemical network,
especially N + CN and H3+ + O, have changed the model sensitivity to the oxygen
elemental abundance. In addition, the gas-phase abundances calculated with our
gas-grain model are less sensitive to the elemental C/O ratio than those
computed with a pure gas-phase model. The grain surface chemistry plays the
role of a buffer absorbing most of the extra carbon. Finally, to reproduce the
low abundance of molecular oxygen observed in dark clouds at all times, we need
an oxygen elemental abundance smaller than 1.6E-4. Conclusion: The chemistry of
molecular oxygen in dense clouds is quite sensitive to model parameters that
are not necessarily well constrained. That O2 abundance may be sensitive to
nitrogen chemistry is an indication of the complexity of interstellar

combine into fermionic excitations with an energy $\epsilon_0$ that is
exponentially small in L. Weak disorder leaves the energy splitting
exponentially small, but affects its typical value and causes large

the lowest-lying bulk energy level $\epsilon_1$ has an algebraic tail at small
$\epsilon_1$. Our findings have implications for the speed at which a

nanoparticles (e.g. Fe, Co) with dimensions ranging from a few nm to 100 nm,

a significant potential for the electronics industry. When the size of the

larger than any scheduled focusing mission at 30 keV, an angular resolution
better than 20 arcseconds in hard X-rays, and polarimetric capabilities within

ensure, in a simple way, scalability and bit allocation. To do so, our main
source of inspiration will be the biologically plausible retina model called
Virtual Retina. Following a similar structure, our model has two stages. The
first stage is an image transform which is performed by the outer layers in the
retina. Here it is modelled by filtering the image with a bank of difference of
Gaussians with time-delays. The second stage is a time-dependent
analog-to-digital conversion which is performed by the inner layers in the

allocation across time. Also, our decoded images do not show annoying artefacts

supermassive black hole and study the mechanism of quasi-linear diffusion (QLD)
to investigate the correlation between $\gamma$-ray and radio emission in
active galactic nuclei. Moving in the nonuniform magnetic field the particles
experience a force that is responsible for the conservation of the adiabatic
invariant. This force, together with the radiation reaction force, tends to
decrease the pitch angles. Contrary to this, the QLD attempts to increase the
pitch angle, and this maintains the synchrotron emission regime. To examine the
balance between the QLD and the aforementioned dissipative factors we
investigate the quasi-stationary state by applying the kinetic equation.
Considering the magnetospheric plasma close to the supermassive black hole, we
examined the efficiency of the QLD for different parameters. By examining the
cyclotron instability, we show that despite the efficient dissipative factors,
the cyclotron modes excite transverse and longitudinal-transversal waves which
leads to the QLD. We find that the QLD provides a connection of emission in the
$\gamma$-ray and radio domains. We show that under favourable conditions the
radio emission from 22 MHz to 9 GHz on the mpc scale is associated with
$\gamma$-ray emission from 900 GeV down to 9 GeV on the same scale.

Thus, no user interaction as well as no double acquisition technique, which
requires a time-consuming proper geometrical registration, is needed. As a
coarser image resolution or slice thickness leads to a higher signal-to-noise

project to investigate in detail the mechanisms that determine the shape of
Milky Way-type dark matter haloes. We find that, when measured at the
instantaneous virial radius, the shape of individual haloes changes with time,
evolving from a typically prolate configuration at early stages to a more
triaxial/oblate geometry at the present day. This evolution in halo shape
correlates well with the distribution of the infalling material: prolate
configurations arise when haloes are fed through narrow filaments, which
characterizes the early epochs of halo assembly, whereas triaxial/oblate
configurations result as the accretion turns more isotropic at later times.
Interestingly, at redshift z=0, clear imprints of the past history of each halo
are recorded in their shapes at different radii, which also exhibit a variation
from prolate in the inner regions to triaxial/oblate in the outskirts. Provided
that the Aquarius haloes are fair representatives of Milky Way-like 10^12 Msun
objects, we conclude that the shape of such dark matter haloes is a complex,
time-dependent property, with each radial shell retaining memory of the
conditions at the time of collapse.

for arithmetic $\mathscr{D}$-modules. We first define the sheaves of
microdifferential operators of arbitrary levels on arbitrary smooth formal
schemes. A difficulty lies in the fact that there are no homomorphisms between
sheaves of microdifferential operators of different levels. To remedy this, we
define the intermediate differential operators, and using these, we define the
sheaf of microdifferential operators for $\mathscr{D}^\dag$. We conjecture that
the characteristic variety of a $\mathscr{D}^\dag$-module is computed as the
support of the microlocalization of a $\mathscr{D}^\dag$-module, and prove it
in the curve case.

coupling limit of 2-color-QCD. Using a canonical transformation of the quark
and gluon fields, which Abelianises the Gauss law constraints to be
implemented, the corresponding unconstrained Hamiltonian and total angular
momentum are derived. In the same way as this reduces the colored spin-1 gluons
to unconstrained colorless spin-0 and spin-2 gluons, it reduces the colored
spin-1/2 quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0 and spin-1 quarks. These
however continue to satisfy anti-commutation relations and hence the
Pauli-exclusion principle. The obtained unconstrained Hamiltonian is then
rewritten into a form, which separates the rotational from the scalar degrees
of freedom. In this form the low-energy spectrum can be obtained with high
accuracy. As an illustrative example, the spin-0 energy-spectrum of the
quark-gluon system is calculated for massless quarks of one flavor. It is
found, that only for the case of 4 reduced quarks (half-filling) satisfying the
boundary condition of particle-antiparticle C-symmetry, states with energy
lower than for the pure-gluon case are obtained. These are the groundstate,
with an energy about 20% lower than for the pure-gluon case and the formation
of a quark condensate, and the sigma-antisigma excitation with an energy about
a fifth of that of the first glueball excitation.

interferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric ""radio

frequencies. Through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexible

incorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individual
elements. We discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations in
general and the potential of LOFAR in addressing these science goals. We
present LOFAR as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations of

properties depend on the X-ray spectral state and history of the source. In
particular, black-hole XRBs emit compact, steady radio jets when they are in
the so-called hard state, the jets become eruptive as the sources move toward
the soft state, disappear in the soft state, and re-appear when the sources
return to the hard state. On the other hand, jets from neutron-star X-ray
binaries are typically weaker radio emitters than the black-hole ones at the
same X-ray luminosity and in some cases radio emission is detected in the soft
state. Significant phenomenology has been accumulated so far regarding the
spectral states of neutron-star and black-hole XRBs, and there is general
agreement about the type of the accretion disk around the compact object in the
various spectral states. Our aim is to investigate whether the phenomenology
regarding the X-ray emission on one hand and the jet appearance and
disappearance on the other can be put together in a consistent physical
picture. It has been shown that the so-called Poynting-Robertson Cosmic Battery
(PRCB) explains in a natural way the formation of magnetic fields in the disks
of AGN and the ejection of jets. We investigate whether the PRCB can also
explain the formation, destruction, and variability of jets in XRBs. We find
excellent agreement between the conditions under which the PRCB is efficient
(i.e., the type of the accretion disk) and the emission or destruction of the
radio jet. The disk-jet connection in XRBs is explained in a natural way using
the PRCB.

infinite length of both kinds.

hydrodynamics in 3+1 dimensions, this leads to a positive contribution to the
shear viscosity, which is finite but inversely proportional to the microscopic
shear viscosity. Therefore the effective infrared viscosity is bounded from
below. The contribution to the second-order transport coefficient $\tau_\pi$ is
divergent, which means that second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics is

to be able to integrate it in tomorrow's electronic devices. Here we show how
the presence of a metallic substrate affects the properties of an atomically
tailored graphene layer. We have deliberately introduced single carbon
vacancies on a graphene monolayer grown on a Pt(111) surface and investigated
its impact in the electronic, structural and magnetic properties of the
graphene layer. Our low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy studies,
complemented by density functional theory, show the existence of a broad
electronic resonance above the Fermi energy associated with the vacancies.
Vacancy sites become reactive leading to an increase of the coupling between
the graphene layer and the metal substrate at these points; this gives rise to
a rapid decay of the localized state and the quenching of the magnetic moment
associated with carbon vacancies in free-standing graphene layers.

entails laboured numerical optimization procedures also demanding quantum state

experimental implementation of such a witness in a room temperature nuclear
magnetic resonance system. In our experiment the nature of correlations is
revealed by performing only few local magnetization measurements. We also
compare the witness results with those for the symmetric quantum discord and we
obtained a fairly good agreement.

algorithm embeds the quivers of these algebras inside a real 3-dimensional

embedded quivers down to a 2-dimensional torus to obtain the corresponding
dimer models. We discuss some examples and use the algorithm to show that all

effect transistors from unzipped multiwall carbon nanotubes. Electrical
transport measurements show that current-annealing effectively removes the
impurities on the suspended graphene nanoribbons, uncovering the intrinsic
ambipolar transfer characteristic of graphene. Further increasing the annealing
current creates a narrow constriction in the ribbon, leading to the formation
of a large band-gap and subsequent high on/off ratio (which can exceed 104).
Such fabricated devices are thermally and mechanically stable: repeated thermal
cycling has little effect on their electrical properties. This work shows for
the first time that ambipolar field effect characteristics and high on/off
ratios at room temperature can be achieved in relatively wide graphene
nanoribbon (15 nm ~50 nm) by controlled current annealing.

the Binet-Legendre metric). The transformation $F \mapsto g_F$ is $C^0$-stable
and has good smoothness properties, in contrast to previous constructions. The
Riemannian metric $g_F$ also behaves nicely under conformal or bilipshitz
deformation of the Finsler metric $F$. These properties makes it a powerful
tool in Finsler geometry and we illustrate that by solving a number of named
Finslerian geometric problems. We also generalize and give new and shorter
proofs of a number of known results. In particular we answer a question of M.
Matsumoto about local conformal mapping between two Minkowski spaces, we
describe all possible conformal self maps and all self similarities on a
Finsler manifold. We also classify all compact conformally flat Finsler
manifolds, solve a conjecture of S. Deng and Z. Hou on the Berwaldian character
of locally symmetric Finsler spaces, and extend the classic result of H.C. Wang
about the maximal dimension of the isometry groups of Finsler manifolds to
manifolds of all dimensions.
  Most proofs in this paper go along the following scheme: using the
correspondence $F \mapsto g_F$we reduce the Finslerian problem to a similar
problem for the Binet-Legendre metric, which is easier and is already solved in
most cases we consider. The solution of the Riemannian problem provides us with
the additional information that helps to solve the initial Finslerian problem.
  Our methods apply even in the absence of the strong convexity assumption
usually assumed in Finsler geometry. The smoothness hypothesis can also be
replaced by that of partial smoothness, a notion we introduce in the paper. Our
results apply therefore to a vast class of Finsler metrics not usually
considered in the Finsler literature.
