core of the group-theoretical approach to integer linear programming. We
introduce two combinatorial operations that transform each vertex of $P(G,g_0)$
to adjacent ones. This implies that for any $P(G,g_0),$ there exists a subset
of basic vertices, we call them support vertices, from which all others can be
built. The class of support vertices is proved to be invariant under the
automorphism group of $G,$ so this basis can be further reduced to a subset of
pairwise non-equivalent support vertices. Among other results, we characterize
irreducible points of the master corner polyhedra, establish relations between
an integer point and the nontrivial facets that pass through it, construct
complete subgraphs of the graph of $P(G,g_0),$ and show that these polyhedra
are of diameter 2.

Klein-Gordon like equation, the underlying theory of the cosmological
perturbations is far more complex than the theories which are using a canonical
scalar field. For example the sound speed of the perturbations is not a
constant but varies with time. We find that in order to explain the observed
value of the spectral-index $n_s$ one must have upper bound on the values of
the background NSS-field. The tensor to scalar ratio remains as small as that
in the case of canonical scalar field driven inflation because the correction
to tensor spectrum due to NSS is required to be very small. In addition we
discuss the relationship of results with previous results obtained by using the

to a tetragonal-orthorhombic structural phase transition in iron pnictides

treated. Our results reveal that the orbital polarization stabilizes the spin
density wave (SDW) order in both tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. However,
the ferro-orbital density wave (F-ODW) only occurs in the orthorhombic phase
rather than in the tetragonal one. Magnetic moments of Fe are small in the
intermediate Coulomb interaction region for the striped antiferromangnetic
phase in the realistic five orbital model. The anisotropic Fermi surface in the
SDW/ODW orthorhombic phase is well in agreement with the recent angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy experiments. These results suggest a scenario that
the magnetic phase transition is driven by the ODW order mainly arising from
the electron-lattice coupling.

graphs of free products. The aim of this paper is to compare the size and
structural properties of the trace, i.e., the subgraph that consists of all
edges and vertices that were visited by some particle, with those of the
original Cayley graph. We investigate the phase when the growth parameter
$\lambda$ is small enough such that the process survives but the trace is not
the original graph. A first result is that the box-counting dimension of the
boundary of the trace exists, is almost surely constant and equals the
Hausdorff dimension which we denote by $\Phi(\lambda)$. The main result states
that the function $\Phi(\lambda)$ has only one point of discontinuity which is
at $\lambda_{c}=R$ where $R$ is the radius of convergence of the Green function
of the underlying random walk. Furthermore, $\Phi(R)$ is bounded by one half
the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary of the original Cayley graph and the
behaviour of $\Phi(R)-\Phi(\lambda)$ as $\lambda \uparrow R$ is classified.
  In the case of free products of infinite groups the end-boundary can be
decomposed into words of finite and words of infinite length. We prove the
existence of a phase transition such that if $\lambda\leq \tilde\lambda_{c}$
the end boundary of the trace consists only of infinite words and if
$\lambda>\tilde\lambda_{c}$ it also contains finite words. In the last case,
the Hausdorff dimension of the set of ends (of the trace and the original
graph) induced by finite words is strictly smaller than the one of the ends
induced by infinite words.

patterns using different tracking data, such as dollar notes, cell phones and

data of US flights. Both topological and geometric properties are examined in
detail. We found that topological properties, such as traffic volume (between
airports) and degree of connectivity (of individual airports), including both
in- and outdegrees, follow a power law distribution but not a geometric
property like travel lengths. The travel lengths exhibit an exponential
distribution rather than a power law with an exponential cutoff as previous
studies illustrated. We further simulated human mobility on the established
topologies of airports with various moving behaviors and found that the
mobility patterns are mainly attributed to the underlying binary topology of
airports and have little to do with other factors, such as moving behaviors and
geometric distances. Apart from the above findings, this study adopts the
head/tail division rule, which is regularity behind any heavy-tailed
distribution for extracting individual airports. The adoption of this rule for
data processing constitutes another major contribution of this paper.

estimator combines Powell (1986) censored quantile regression (CQR) to deal
with censoring, with a control variable approach to incorporate endogenous
regressors. The CQIV estimator is obtained in two stages that are non-additive
in the unobservables. The first stage estimates a non-additive model with
infinite dimensional parameters for the control variable, such as a quantile or
distribution regression model. The second stage estimates a non-additive
censored quantile regression model for the response variable of interest,
including the estimated control variable to deal with endogeneity. For
computation, we extend the algorithm for CQR developed by Chernozhukov and Hong
(2002) to incorporate the estimation of the control variable. We give generic
regularity conditions for asymptotic normality of the CQIV estimator and for
the validity of resampling methods to approximate its asymptotic distribution.
We verify these conditions for quantile and distribution regression estimation
of the control variable. Our analysis covers two-stage (uncensored) quantile
regression with non-additive first stage as an important special case. We
illustrate the computation and applicability of the CQIV estimator with a
Monte-Carlo numerical example and an empirical application on estimation of
Engel curves for alcohol.

The identification of the carriers of diffuse interstellar bands
(DIBs) remains one of the long-standing mysteries in astronomy. The detection
of a polarisation signal in a DIB profile can be used to distinguish between a
dust or gas-phase carrier. The polarisation profile can give additional
information on the grain or molecular properties of the absorber. In order to
detect and measure the linear and circular polarisation of the DIBs we observed
reddened lines of sight showing continuum polarisation. For this study we
selected two stars HD 197770 and HD 194279. We used high-resolution (R~64.000)
spectropolarimetry in the wavelength range from 3700 to 10480 Angstrom with the
ESPaDOnS echelle spectrograph mounted at the CFHT.
  Results. High S/N and high resolution Stokes V (circular), Q and U (linear)
spectra were obtained. We constrained upper limits by a factor of 10 for
previously observed DIBs. Furthermore, we analysed ~30 additional DIBs for
which no spectropolarimetry data has been obtained before. This included the
9577 A DIB and the 8621 A DIB.
  Conclusions. The lack of polarisation in 45 DIB profiles suggests that none
of the absorption lines is induced by a grain-type carrier. The strict upper
limits, less than ~0.01%, derived for the observed lines-of-sight imply that if
DIBs are due to gas-phase molecules these carriers have polarisation
efficiencies which are at least 6 times, and up to 300 times, smaller than
those predicted for grain-related carriers.

that we adapt approaches from topological methods such as n-dimensional
relativistic representation. A number of hypothetical examples will be provided

  The long-term goal of this work is that truly invariant representations will
ultimately result from establishing formal, inclusive relationships between
these different domains. Using this framework, incomplete information in one or
more domains can be compensated for by parallelism and mappings within the
virtual world representation. To introduce this approach, I will review recent
developments in embodiment, virtual world technology, and neuroscience relevant
to the control of virtual worlds. The next step will be to borrow ideas from
fields such as brain science, applied mathematics, and cosmology to give proper
perspective to this approach. A simple demonstration will then be given using
an intuitive example of physical relativism. Finally, future directions for the
application of this method will be considered.

Wright and Ramkrishna (1992) based on the assumption of self-similarity is
implemented and tested on numerical data generated for a range of different
collision kernels. This method expands the collision kernel as a sum of
orthogonal polynomials and works best when the kernel can be expressed exactly

provide an a-priori understanding of the optimal value of the regularisation
parameter and the reliability of the inversion procedure. For kernels which are

empirically that the performance of the method can be enhanced by choosing a

the intersection of the electron spin singlet $S$ and the lower energy
component $T_{+}$ of the spin triplet. The electron spin interacts with nuclear
spins and is influenced by the spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is based on a
quantum description of the electron spin in combination with the coherent
semiclassical dynamics of nuclear spins. We consider single and double
Landau-Zener passages across the $S$-$T_{+}$ anticrossings. For linear sweeps,
the electron dynamics is expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions.
The dynamical nuclear polarization is described by two complex conjugate
functions $\Lambda ^{\pm}$ related to the integrals of the products of the
singlet and triplet amplitudes ${\tilde{c}}_{S}^{\ast}{\tilde{c}}_{T_{+}}$
along the sweep. The real part $P$ of $\Lambda ^{\pm}$ is related to the
$S$-$T_{+}$ spin-transition probability, accumulates in the vicinity of the
anticrossing, and for long linear passages coincides with the Landau-Zener
probability $P_{LZ}=1-e^{-2\pi \gamma}$, where $\gamma $ is the Landau-Zener
parameter. The imaginary part $Q$ of $\Lambda^{+}$ is specific for the nuclear
spin dynamics, accumulates during the whole sweep, and for $\gamma \gtrsim 1$
is typically an order of magnitude larger than $P$. $Q$ has a profound effect
on the nuclear spin dynamics, by (i) causing intensive shake-up processes among
the nuclear spins and (ii) producing a high nuclear spin generation rate when
the hyperfine and spin-orbit interactions are comparable in magnitude. We find
analytical expressions for the back-action of the nuclear reservoir represented
via the change in the Overhauser fields the electron subsystem experiences.

convex minimization of a penalized joint loss function for the regression

the scaled lasso simultaneously yields an estimator for the noise level and an

These inequalities provide sufficient conditions for the consistency and
asymptotic normality of the noise level estimator, including certain cases

computational simplicity with physical realizability: it is a rigorous limit of
gyrokinetics for plasma beta of order the electron-ion mass ratio. The model
contains collisions and can be used both in the collisional and collisionless
reconnection regimes. It includes gyrokinetic ions (not assumed cold) and
allows for the topological rearrangement of the magnetic field lines by either
resistivity or electron inertia, whichever predominates. The two-fluid dynamics
are coupled to electron kinetics --- electrons are not assumed isothermal and
are described by a reduced drift-kinetic equation. The model therefore allows
for irreversibility and conversion of magnetic energy into electron heat via
parallel phase mixing in velocity space. An analysis of the exchanges between
various forms of free energy and its conversion into electron heat is provided.
It is shown how all relevant linear waves and regimes of the tearing
instability (collisionless, semicollisional and fully resistive) are recovered
in various limits of our model. An efficient way to simulate our equations
numerically is proposed, via the Hermite representation of the velocity space.
It is shown that small scales in velocity space will form, giving rise to a
shallow Hermite-space spectrum, whence it is inferred that, for steady-state or
sufficiently slow dynamics, the electron heating rate will remain finite in the
limit of vanishing collisionality.

This is what we can term dynamical typicality. The theoretical analysis is
substantiated by numerical simulations of the response of a spin system to a

that not only the system relaxes toward a new equilibrium state after the

insulator Bi2Se3, see Xia \textit{et.al.,} Nature Phys. 5, 398 (2009) at

the topological insulator state formation is visualized for the first time. In
the topological state, vortex-like polarization states are observed to exhibit
3D vectorial textures, which collectively feature a chirality transition of its
topological spin-textures as the spin-momentum locked (Z2 topologically
ordered) electrons on the surface go through the zero carrier density point.
Such phase transition and texture chirality inversion can be the physical basis
for observing \textit{fractional charge} (e/2) and other related fractional
topological phenomena.

situation in evacuation dynamics, in which evacuees have to choose between two
escape routes. The coupling between the two processes occurs through one common
point at which particles are injected, the process can be controlled by
directing incoming individuals into either of the two escape routes. Based on a
mean-field approach we determine the phase behaviour of the model, and
analytically compute optimal control strategies, maximising the total current
through the system. Results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also
show that dynamic intervention, exploiting fluctuations about the mean-field
stationary state, can lead to a further increase in total current.

reversed with 100% efficiency by using weak non-adiabatic tuning of the wave
velocity at time-scales that can be much slower than the period. Unlike
previous schemes, we demonstrate reversal of {\em broadband} (few cycle) pulses
with simple structures. Our scheme may thus open the way to time-reversal in a
variety of systems for which it was not accessible before.

be controlled in materials such as graphene and topological insulators, via the
application of light. Remarkably, under the application of off-resonant light,
topological transport properties can be induced; these systems exhibits quantum
Hall effects in the absence of a magnetic field with a near quantization of the
Hall conductance, realizing so-called quantum Hall systems without Landau
levels first proposed by Haldane.

in the $(\beta, \gamma)$ deformation plane by using a newly developed
constrained relativistic mean field (RMF) model. As examples, the results of
some C, Mg, and Si nuclei are presented and discussed in details. We found that
for normal nuclei the present RMF calculations and previous Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
models predict similar trends of the shape evolution with the neutron number
increasing. But some quantitative aspects from these two approaches, such as
the depth of the minimum and the softness in the $\gamma$ direction, differ a
lot for several nuclei. For $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, in most cases, the addition
of a $\Lambda$ hyperon alters slightly the location of the ground state minimum
towards the direction of smaller $\beta$ and softer $\gamma$ in the potential
energy surface $E \sim (\beta, \gamma)$. There are three exceptions, namely,
$^{13}_\Lambda$C, $^{23}_\Lambda$C, and $^{31}_\Lambda$Si in which the
polarization effect of the additional $\Lambda$ is so strong that the shapes of
these three hypernuclei are drastically different from their corresponding core
nuclei.
