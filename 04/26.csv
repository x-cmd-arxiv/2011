nanowires of length ~ 100 nm exposed to microwave radiation of frequencies
between 100 MHz and 15 GHz. The radiation causes a decrease of the average
switching current of the wire. This suppression of the switching current is
modeled assuming that there is one-to-one correspondence between Little's phase
slips and the experimentally observed switching events. At some critical power
P* of the radiation a dissipative dynamic superconducting state occurs as an
extra step on the V-I curve. It is identified as a phase slip center (PSC).
With the dependence of the switching currents and the standard deviations
observed at the transitions (i) from a constant supercurrent state to a normal
state and (ii) from a constant superconducting state to a PSC state, we
conclude that both of the two types of the switching events are triggered by
the same microscopic event, namely a single Little's phase slip. We show that
the Skocpol-Beasely-Tinkham model is not applicable to our microwave-driven
phase slip centers, since it leads to an unphysical small estimated value of
the size of the dissipative core of the PSC. Through the analysis of the
witching current distributions at a sufficiently low temperature, we also
present evidence that the quantum phase slip play a role in switching events
under microwaves.

Programming problems with positive semidefinite objective functions and global
linear constraints. This framework includes well known graph problems such as
Minimum graph bisection, Edge expansion, Uniform sparsest cut, and Small Set
expansion, as well as the Unique Games problem. These problems are notorious
for the existence of huge gaps between the known algorithmic results and
NP-hardness results. Our algorithm is based on rounding semidefinite programs
from the Lasserre hierarchy, and the analysis uses bounds for low-rank
approximations of a matrix in Frobenius norm using columns of the matrix.
  For all the above graph problems, we give an algorithm running in time
$n^{O(r/\epsilon^2)}$ with approximation ratio
$\frac{1+\epsilon}{\min\{1,\lambda_r\}}$, where $\lambda_r$ is the $r$'th
smallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$. In the
case of graph bisection and small set expansion, the number of vertices in the
cut is within lower-order terms of the stipulated bound. Our results imply
$(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor approximation in time $n^{O(r^\ast/\epsilon^2)}$ where
$r^\ast$ is the number of eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$ smaller than
$1-\epsilon$.
  For Unique Games, we give a factor $(1+\frac{2+\epsilon}{\lambda_r})$
approximation for minimizing the number of unsatisfied constraints in
$n^{O(r/\epsilon)}$ time. This improves an earlier bound for solving Unique
Games on expanders, and also shows that Lasserre SDPs are powerful enough to
solve well-known integrality gap instances for the basic SDP.
  We also give an algorithm for independent sets in graphs that performs well
when the Laplacian does not have too many eigenvalues bigger than $1+o(1)$.

which is to serve as limiting object- distinct from other such limits
introduced previously- for the canonical system, as a smooth curve degenerates
to $X_0$. First for curves which cannot be separated by 2 or fewer nodes, the
so-called '2-inseparable' curves, the sepcanonical system is just the sections
of the dualizing sheaf, which is not very ample iff $X_0$ is a limit of smooth
hyperelliptic curves (such $X_0$ are called 2-inseparable hyperelliptics).
  For general, 2-separable curves $X_0$ this assertion is false, leading us to
introduce the sepcanonical system, which is a collection of linear systems on
the '2-inseparable parts' of $X_0$, each associated to a different twisted
limit of the canonical system, where the entire collection varies smoothly with
$X_0$. To define sepcanonical system, we must endow the curve with extra
structure called an 'azimuthal structure'. We show that the sepcanonical system
is 'essentially very ample' unless the curve is a tree-like arrangement of
2-inseparable hyperelliptics. In a subsequent paper, we will show that the
latter property is equivalent to the curve being a limit of smooth
hyperelliptics, and will essentially give defining equation for the closure of
the locus of smooth hyperelliptic curves in the moduli space of stable curves.

Jupiters in both transiting and nontransiting configurations, and could be
observed for hot terrestrial exoplanets. We study the wavelength and phase
changes of the thermal emission of a tidally-locked terrestrial planet as
atmospheric pressure increases, and address the observability of these
multiband phase-curves and the ability to use them to detect atmospheric
constituents. We used a 3D climate model (GCM) to simulate the CO2 atmosphere
of a terrestrial planet on an 8-day orbit around a M3 dwarf and its apparent
infrared emission as a function of its orbital phase. We estimated the signal
to photon-noise ratio in narrow bands between 2.5 and 20 microns for a 10 pc
target observed with a 6 and 1.5 m telescope (respectively the sizes of JWST

variations and can be easily distinguished from dense absorbing atmospheres.
Photon-noise limited spectro-photometry of nearby systems could allow us to
detect and characterize the atmosphere of nontransiting terrestrial planets

observations are the required photometric sensitivity (1E-5) over the duration

overcoming these obstacles would give access to one order of magnitude more

Solitaire-type ring galaxies in an early stage of ring formation. The main goal
of this work is to provide the spectral characteristics of the current object
and its companion AM 1646-795 (NED01). Methods. The study is based on
spectroscopic observations in the optical band to highlight the characteristics
of this interacting galaxy. To investigate the star formation history of HRG
2304 we used the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. The direct V and
B broad band images were used to enhance some fine structures. Results. Along
the entire long-slit signal, the spectra of HRG 2304 and its companion resemble
that of an early-type galaxy. We estimated a heliocentric systemic redshift of
z = 0.0415, corresponding to heliocentric velocities of 12449 km s-1 for HRG
2304 (NED02) and 12430 km s-1 for AM1646-795 (NED01). The spatial variation in
the contribution of the stellar population components for both objects are
dominated by an old stellar population 2x10^9 < t < 13x10^9 yr. The observed
radial-velocity distribution and the fine structures around HRG 2304 suggest an
ongoing tidal interaction of both galaxies. Conclusions.The spectroscopic
results and the morphological peculiarities of HRG 2304 can be adequately
interpreted as an ongoing interaction with the companion galaxy. Both galaxies
are early-type, the companion is elliptical, and the smooth distribution of the
material around HRG 2304 and its off-center nucleus in the direction of

analyze two scenarios: one where group members begin treatment when a similar

general trend of the simulated and observed CMR. However, in many clusters, the
most luminous galaxies depart from the linear fit to observed data displaying
almost constant colours. With the aim of understanding this behaviour, we
analyze the dependence with redshift of the stellar mass contributed to each
galaxy by different processes, i.e., quiescent star formation, and starburst
during major/minor and wet/dry mergers, and disk instability events. The
evolution of the metallicity of the stellar component, contributed by each of
these processes, is also investigated. We find that the major contribution of
stellar mass at low redshift is due to minor dry merger events, being the
metallicity of the stellar mass accreted during this process quite low. Thus,
minor dry merger events seem to increase the mass of the more luminous galaxies

10% of the X-ray flux. We find results consistent with the predictions of
numerical simulations of the line-driving instability, including line
broadening indicating an onset radius of X-ray emission of several tenths
Rstar. Helium-like forbidden-to-intercombination line ratios are consistent
with this onset radius, and inconsistent with being formed in a wind-collision
interface with the star's closest visual companion at a distance of ~100 AU.
The broadband X-ray spectrum is fit with a dominant emission temperature of
just kT = 0.6 keV along with significant wind absorption. The broadband wind
absorption and the line profiles provide two independent measurements of the
wind mass-loss rate: Mdot = 5.2_{-1.5}^{+1.8} \times 10^{-6} Msun/yr and Mdot =
6.8_{-2.2}^{+2.8} \times 10^{-6} Msun/yr, respectively. This is the first
consistent modeling of the X-ray line profile shapes and broadband X-ray
spectral energy distribution in a massive star, and represents a reduction of a
factor of 3 to 4 compared to the standard H-alpha mass-loss rate that assumes a
smooth wind.

They can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from a

Continuous accretion drives Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which are known to be
variable but have never been observed to turn on or off. Tidal disruption of
stars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-
set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. Here we report the
first discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the new
extragalactic transient, Swift J164449.3+573451. The behaviour of this new

observations of the jet-dominated AGN known as blazars. These differences may
stem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. Such
an event in the massive black hole at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy could
strongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the Earth, if beamed towards us.

singular region of the spacetime by a region containing some form of matter or
false vacuum configuration that can also cohabit with the black hole interior.
Black holes without singularities are called regular black holes. In the
present work regular black hole solutions are found within general relativity
coupled to Maxwell's electromagnetism and charged matter. We show that there
are objects which correspond to regular charged black holes, whose interior

baryonic and dark matter abundances can be explained naturally in these setups

the need to introduce any slow-roll potential. Our point is that composite
Higgs models where electroweak symmetry breaking arises via a strongly
first-order phase transition provide a well-motivated framework for cold
baryogenesis. In this case, reheating proceeds by bubble collisions and we
argue that this can induce changes in Chern-Simons number, which in the
presence of new sources of CP violation commonly lead to baryogenesis. We
illustrate this mechanism using as a source of CP violation an effective
dimension-six operator which is free from EDM constraints, another advantage of
cold baryogenesis compared to the standard theory of electroweak baryogenesis.
Our results are general as they do not rely on any particular UV completion but
only on a stage of supercooling ended by a first-order phase transition in the
evolution of the universe, which can be natural if there is nearly conformal
dynamics at the TeV scale. Besides, baryon-number violation originates from the

integrated mass density of black holes in the Universe; the luminosity function

predominantly at the low mass end of the present day black hole mass function.
However, all our models predict that low surface brightness, bulge-less
galaxies with large discs are least likely to be sites for the formation of
massive seed black holes at high redshifts. The efficiency of seed formation at
high redshifts has a direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction in
galaxies at z=0. This effect is more pronounced for low mass galaxies. This is
the key discriminant between the models studied here and the Population III
remnant `light' seed model. We find that there exists a population of low mass
galaxies that do not host nuclear black holes. Our prediction of the shape of
the M-sigma relation at the low mass end and increased scatter has recently

to measure the spatial fluctuations in this emission, and use this as a tracer
of large scale structure at very early times in the history of our Universe.
This measurement would help determine the properties of molecular clouds -- the
sites of star formation -- in the very galaxies that reionize the Universe. We
further consider the possibility of cross-correlating CO intensity maps with
future observations of the redshifted 21 cm line. The cross spectrum is less
sensitive to foreground contamination than the auto power spectra, and can
therefore help confirm the high redshift origin of each signal. Furthermore,
the cross spectrum measurement would help extract key information about the
EoR, especially regarding the size distribution of ionized regions. We discuss
uncertainties in predicting the CO signal at high redshift, and discuss
strategies for improving these predictions. Under favorable assumptions, and
feasible specifications for a CO survey mapping the CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) lines,
the power spectrum of CO emission fluctuations and its cross spectrum with

giving us a good opportunity to track the evolution of spectral and timing

The source was first detected in a hard state during which strong low-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were detected. The QPOs persisted for about
35 days and a signature of the transition from the hard to soft intermediate
states was seen in the timing data. The source entered a short-lived thermal

spectral hardness as the source flux declined and returned to a hard state at
the end of the outburst. The progression of spectral states and the nature of

particles by black holes to infinite energies in the centre of mass frame is
suggested. It is based on kinematics of particles moving near the horizon. This
effect arises when particles of two kinds collide near the horizon. For massive
particles, the first kind represents a particle with the generic energy and
angular momentum (I call them ""usual""). Near the horizon, such a particle has a
velocity almost equal to that of light in the frame that corotates with a black
hole (the frame is static if a black hole is static). The second kind (called
""critical"") consists of particles with the velocity v<c near the horizon due to
special relationship between the energy and angular momentum (or charge). As a
result, the relative velocity approaches the speed of light c, the Lorentz
factor grows unbound. This explanation applies both to generic rotating black
holes and charged ones (even for radial motion of particles). If one of
colliding particles is massless (photon), the critical particle is
distinguished by the fact that its frequency is finite near the horizon. The
existence (or absence) of the effect is determined depending on competition of
two factors - gravitational blue shift for a photon propagating towards a black
hole and the Doppler effect due to transformation from the locally nonrotating
frame to a comoving one. Classification of all possible types of collisions is
suggested depending on whether massive or massless particle is critical or
usual.

the number of (observed) missing edges within clusters, and (observed) present
edges across clusters. Our algorithm uses convex optimization; its basis is a
reduction of disagreement minimization to the problem of recovering an
(unknown) low-rank matrix and an (unknown) sparse matrix from their partially
observed sum. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the classical
Planted Partition/Stochastic Block Model. Our main theorem provides sufficient
conditions for the success of our algorithm as a function of the minimum
cluster size, edge density and observation probability; in particular, the
results characterize the tradeoff between the observation probability and the
edge density gap. When there are a constant number of clusters of equal size,
our results are optimal up to logarithmic factors.

folded spinning strings in AdS_3, which may be of interest in the context of
AdS/CFT duality. We start with a classical closed string and assume that it can
split on two closed string fragments, if at a given time two points on it
coincide in target space and their velocities agree. First we consider the case
of the folded string with large spin. Assuming the formal large-spin
approximation of the folded string solution in AdS_3, we can completely
describe the process of splitting: compute the full set of charges and obtain
the string solutions describing the evolution of the final states. We find
that, in this limit, the world surface does not change in the process and the
final states are described by the solutions of the same type as the initial
string, i.e. the formal large-spin approximation of the folded string in AdS_3.
Then we consider the general case --- splitting of string given by the exact
folded string solution. We find the expressions for the charges of the final
fragments, the coordinate transformations diagonalizing them and, finally,
their energies and spins. Due to the complexity of the initial string profile,
we cannot find the solutions describing the evolution of the final fragments,
but we can predict their qualitative behavior. We also generalize the results
to include circular rotations and windings in S^5.

architectures on the capacity of the two-user interference channel. For a
two-user interference channel, a feedback link can exist between receivers and
transmitters in 9 canonical architectures (see Fig. 2), ranging from only one
feedback link to four feedback links. We derive the exact capacity region for
the symmetric deterministic interference channel and the constant-gap capacity
region for the symmetric Gaussian interference channel for all of the 9
architectures. We show that for a linear deterministic symmetric interference
channel, in the weak interference regime, all models of feedback, except the
one, which has only one of the receivers feeding back to its own transmitter,
have the identical capacity region. When only one of the receivers feeds back
to its own transmitter, the capacity region is a strict subset of the capacity
region of the rest of the feedback models in the weak interference regime.
However, the sum-capacity of all feedback models is identical in the weak
interference regime. Moreover, in the strong interference regime all models of
feedback with at least one of the receivers feeding back to its own transmitter
have the identical sum-capacity. For the Gaussian interference channel, the
results of the linear deterministic model follow, where capacity is replaced
with approximate capacity.

(f_a) as high as the SUSY GUT scale (M_{GUT} \sim 10^{16} GeV) in the context
of the PQMSSM with either an axino or a neutralino LSP. The main problem in
non-SUSY models with f_a\sim M_{GUT} is the generation of an overabundance of
axion dark matter (\sim f_a^{7/6}) due to vacuum misalignment. We show that
once all the components of the axion supermultiplet are included, the upper
limit on f_a can be evaded due to large entropy injection from saxion decays.
This large entropy injection also dilutes all other quasi-stable relic
densities, naturally evading the BBN constraints and solving the gravitino
problem. We find that f_a\sim M_{GUT} can be allowed by relic density/BBN
constraints provided that the saxion mass m_s> 50 TeV, the initial saxion field
value is of order of the PQ scale and the initial axion mis-alignment angle
\theta_i\alt 0.05 . These restrictions can be considerably loosened for f_a\sim
10^{15} GeV. The allowed range for the re-heat temperature (T_R) is strongly
dependent on the nature of the LSP. For the axino LSP, T_R \gtrsim 10^8 GeV,
while for neutralino LSP any value is allowed. In the latter case, f_a\sim
M_{GUT} can be more easily accommodated than in the axino LSP scenario. For
f_a\sim M_{GUT} in SUSY models, the dark matter abundance should be dominated
by axions, albeit with mass m_a\sim 10^{-10} eV, far below the region currently
probed by experiment.

Our analysis also reveals a smooth chromatic evolution of the spatial
distribution where sources detected at short-wavelengths, likely proto-stars
surrounded by warm circumstellar material emitting in the far-infrared, tend to
be clustered in dense and compact groups around HII regions while sources
detected at long-wavelengths, presumably cold and dusty density enhancements of

correlation, one can study galaxies which are too faint to be individually
resolved. This technique, known as intensity mapping, is a promising probe of
the global properties of high redshift galaxies. Here, we test the feasibility
of such measurements with synthetic data generated from cosmological dark
matter simulations. We use a simple prescription for associating galaxies with
dark matter halos and create a realization of emitted radiation as a function
of angular position and wavelength over a patch of the sky. This is then used
to create synthetic data for two different hypothetical instruments, one aboard
the Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) and another
consisting of a pair of ground based radio telescopes designed to measure the

and the heteroclinic graph carrying their equilibrium points. By systematic
simplification of the arising Morse-Smale complex in a one-parameter process we
show that equilibria occur typically in highly localized groups (flocks), the
number of the latter can be reliably observed and determined by hand
experiments. Both local and global (micro and macro) equilibria can be either
stable or unstable. Most commonly, rocks and pebbles are balanced on stable
local equilibria belonging to stable flocks. However, it is possible to balance
a convex body on a stable local equilibrium belonging to an unstable flock and
this is the intriguing mechanical scenario corresponding to rocking stones.
Since outside observers can only reliably perceive flocks, the last described
situation will appear counter-intuitive. Comparison of computer experiments to
hand experiments reveals that the latter are consistent, i.e. the flocks can be
reliably counted and the pebble classification system proposed in our previous
work (Domokos et al 2010) is robustly applicable. We also find an interesting
logarithmic relationship between the Zingg parameters and the average number of

Hodgkin-Huxley framework for modeling electrically active cells. This
framework, expressed through a set of differential equations, synthesizes the
impact of ionic currents on a cell's voltage -- and the highly nonlinear impact
of that voltage back on the currents themselves -- into the rapid push and pull
of the action potential. Latter studies confirmed that these cellular dynamics
are orchestrated by individual ion channels, whose conformational changes
regulate the conductance of each ionic current. Thus, kinetic equations
familiar from physical chemistry are the natural setting for describing
conductances; for small-to-moderate numbers of channels, these will predict
fluctuations in conductances and stochasticity in the resulting action
potentials. At first glance, the kinetic equations provide a far more complex
(and higher-dimensional) description than the original Hodgkin-Huxley
equations. This has prompted more than a decade of efforts to capture channel
fluctuations with noise terms added to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. Many of
these approaches, while intuitively appealing, produce quantitative errors when
compared to kinetic equations; others, as only very recently demonstrated, are
both accurate and relatively simple. We review what works, what doesn't, and
why, seeking to build a bridge to well-established results for the
deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations. As such, we hope that this review will
speed emerging studies of how channel noise modulates electrophysiological
dynamics and function. We supply user-friendly Matlab simulation code of these
stochastic versions of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations on the ModelDB website

formed by the combination of a data-dependent loss function with a norm-based
regularizer. We analyze the convergence rates of projected gradient and
composite gradient methods for solving such problems, working within a
high-dimensional framework that allows the data dimension $\pdim$ to grow with
(and possibly exceed) the sample size $\numobs$. This high-dimensional
structure precludes the usual global assumptions---namely, strong convexity and
smoothness conditions---that underlie much of classical optimization analysis.
We define appropriately restricted versions of these conditions, and show that
they are satisfied with high probability for various statistical models. Under
these conditions, our theory guarantees that projected gradient descent has a
globally geometric rate of convergence up to the \emph{statistical precision}
of the model, meaning the typical distance between the true unknown parameter
$\theta^*$ and an optimal solution $\hat{\theta}$. This result is substantially
sharper than previous convergence results, which yielded sublinear convergence,
or linear convergence only up to the noise level. Our analysis applies to a
wide range of $M$-estimators and statistical models, including sparse linear
regression using Lasso ($\ell_1$-regularized regression); group Lasso for block
sparsity; log-linear models with regularization; low-rank matrix recovery using
nuclear norm regularization; and matrix decomposition. Overall, our analysis
reveals interesting connections between statistical precision and computational
efficiency in high-dimensional estimation.

the following results. (1) The 34 active regions of the solar cycle 24 follow
the so-called hemispheric helicity rule, whereas the 30 active regions of the
solar cycle 23 do not. (2) When combining all 64 active regions as one sample,
they follow the hemispheric helicity sign rule as in most other observations.
(3) Despite with the so-far most accurate measurement of vector magnetic field
given by SP/Hinode, the rule is still weak with large scatters. (4) The data
show evidence of different helicity signs between strong and weak fields,
confirming previous result from a large sample of ground-based observations.
(5) With two example sunspots we show that the helicity parameters change sign
from the inner umbra to the outer penumbra, where the sign of penumbra agrees
with the sign of the active region as a whole. From these results, we speculate
that both the Sigma-effect (turbulent convection) and the dynamo have

form of flares altering a baseline characteristic activity level; the largest
X-ray flares are characterized by a rapid rise to more than 10 times the
characteristic count rate, followed by a slower quasi-exponential decay.
Analysis of these high-contrast X-ray flares enables the study of the innermost
magnetic fields of pre-main sequence stars. We have scanned the ANCHORS
database of Chandra observations of star-forming regions to extend the study of
flare events on pre-main sequence stars both in sky coverage and in volume. We
developed a sample of 30 high-contrast flares out of the 14,000 stars of
various ages and masses available in ANCHORS at the start of our study.
Applying methods of time-resolved spectral analysis, we obtain the
temperatures, confining magnetic field strengths, and loop lengths of these
bright, energetic flares. The results of the flare analysis are compared to the
2MASS and Spitzer data available for the stars in our sample. We find that the
longest flare loop lengths (of order several stellar radii) are only seen on
stars whose IR data indicates the presence of disks. This suggests that the
longest flares may stretch all the way to the disk. Such long flares tend to be
more tenuous than the other large flares studied. A wide range of loop lengths
are observed, indicating that different types of flares may occur on disked
young stellar objects.

  Acquisition: Noise Folding vs. Dynamic Range",,,"10.1109/TSP.2012.2201149",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressive sensing (CS) exploits the sparsity present in many signals to
reduce the number of measurements needed for digital acquisition. With this
reduction would come, in theory, commensurate reductions in the size, weight,
power consumption, and/or monetary cost of both signal sensors and any
associated communication links. This paper examines the use of CS in the design
of a wideband radio receiver in a noisy environment. We formulate the problem
statement for such a receiver and establish a reasonable set of requirements
that a receiver should meet to be practically useful. We then evaluate the
performance of a CS-based receiver in two ways: via a theoretical analysis of
its expected performance, with a particular emphasis on noise and dynamic
range, and via simulations that compare the CS receiver against the performance
expected from a conventional implementation. On the one hand, we show that
CS-based systems that aim to reduce the number of acquired measurements are
somewhat sensitive to signal noise, exhibiting a 3dB SNR loss per octave of
subsampling, which parallels the classic noise-folding phenomenon. On the other
hand, we demonstrate that since they sample at a lower rate, CS-based systems
can potentially attain a significantly larger dynamic range. Hence, we conclude
that while a CS-based system has inherent limitations that do impose some
restrictions on its potential applications, it also has attributes that make it
highly desirable in a number of important practical settings.

  Attack on Disk Encryption","13 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Disk encryption has become an important security measure for a multitude of
clients, including governments, corporations, activists, security-conscious
professionals, and privacy-conscious individuals. Unfortunately, recent
research has discovered an effective side channel attack against any disk
mounted by a running machine\cite{princetonattack}. This attack, known as the
cold boot attack, is effective against any mounted volume using
state-of-the-art disk encryption, is relatively simple to perform for an
attacker with even rudimentary technical knowledge and training, and is
applicable to exactly the scenario against which disk encryption is primarily
supposed to defend: an adversary with physical access. To our knowledge, no
effective software-based countermeasure to this attack supporting multiple
encryption keys has yet been articulated in the literature. Moreover, since no
proposed solution has been implemented in publicly available software, all
general-purpose machines using disk encryption remain vulnerable. We present
Loop-Amnesia, a kernel-based disk encryption mechanism implementing a novel
technique to eliminate vulnerability to the cold boot attack. We offer
theoretical justification of Loop-Amnesia's invulnerability to the attack,
verify that our implementation is not vulnerable in practice, and present
measurements showing our impact on I/O accesses to the encrypted disk is
limited to a slowdown of approximately 2x. Loop-Amnesia is written for x86-64,
but our technique is applicable to other register-based architectures. We base
our work on loop-AES, a state-of-the-art open source disk encryption package

old and $[\alpha/Fe]$ over abundant stellar populations. Indeed, using the SSP

well with the measured colors and present red sharp peaks at the galaxy center.
The sharp peaks of the colors are mainly shaped by the high metallicity in the

orbiting a central body acted upon by an incident monochromatic plane
gravitational wave. We assume that the characteristic size of the perturbed

also suppose that the wave's frequency is much smaller than the particle's
orbital one. We make neither a priori assumptions about the direction of the
wavevector nor on the orbital geometry of the planet. We find that, while the
semi-major axis is left unaffected, the eccentricity, the inclination, the
longitude of the ascending node, the longitude of pericenter and the mean
anomaly undergo non-vanishing long-term changes. They are not secular trends
because of the slow modulation introduced by the tidal matrix coefficients and
by the orbital elements themselves. They could be useful to indepenedently
constrain the ultra-low frequency waves which may have been indirectly detected
in the BICEP2 experiment. Our calculation holds, in general, for any
gravitationally bound two-body system whose characteristic frequency is much
larger than the frequency of the external wave. It is also valid for a generic
perturbation of tidal type with constant coefficients over timescales of the
order of the orbital period of the perturbed particle.

amorphous plasticity. Plastic deformation is assumed to occur through a series
of local reorganizations. Using a discretization of the mechanical fields on a
discrete lattice, local reorganizations are modeled as local slip events. Local
yield stresses are randomly distributed in space and invariant in time. Each
plastic slip event induces a long-ranged elastic stress redistribution.
Mimicking the effect of aging, we focus on the behavior of the model when the
initial state is characterized by a distribution of high local yield stress
values. A dramatic effect on the localization behavior is obtained: the system
first spontaneously self-traps to form a shear band which then only slowly
widens. The higher the ""age"" parameter the more localized the plastic strain
field. Two-time correlation computed on the stress field show a divergent
correlation time with the age parameter. The amplitude of a local slip event
(the prefactor of the Eshelby singularity) as compared to the yield stress
distribution width acts here as an effective temperature-like parameter: the
lower the slip increment, the higher the localization and the decorrelation
time.

large scatter, which we measure and quantify in detail. We compare the
Automatic Spectroscopic K-means based classification (ASK) with most of the
commonly used morphological classifications. All of them provide consistent
results. Given a spectral class, the morphological type wavers with a standard
deviation between 2 and 3 T types, and the same large dispersion characterizes
the variability of spectral classes fixed the morphological type. The
distributions of Hubble types given an ASK class are very skewed -- they
present long tails that go to the late morphological types for the red
galaxies, and to the early morphological types for the blue spectroscopic
classes. The scatter is not produced by problems in the classification, and it
remains when particular subsets are considered. A considerable fraction of the
red galaxies are spirals (40--60 %), but they never present very late Hubble
types (Sd or later). Even though red spectra are not associated with
ellipticals, most ellipticals do have red spectra: 97 % of the ellipticals in
the morphological catalog by Nair & Abraham, used here for reference, belong to
ASK 0, 2 or 3. It contains only a 3 % of blue ellipticals. The galaxies in the
green valley class (ASK~5) are mostly spirals, and the AGN class (ASK 6)
presents a large scatter of Hubble types from E to Sd. From redshift 0.25 to
now the galaxies redden from ASK 2 to ASK 0, as expected from the passive
evolution of their stellar populations. Two of the ASK classes (1 and 4) gather
edge-on spirals, a property of interest in studies requiring knowing the
intrinsic shape of a galaxy (e.g., weak lensing calibration).

Assuming that two kinds of bosonic degrees of freedom, hybridization

second $\pi$-pulse can be used to simultaneously reverse the atomic phase and
bring the atoms back into the ground state. Then a secondary echo is radiated
from a non-inverted medium, avoiding contamination by gain and spontaneous

by means of infall of gas and divide the disk into several independent rings
without exchange of matter between them. However, if gas infall is important,
radial gas flows should be taken into account as a dynamical consequence of
infall. The aim of this paper is to test the effect of radial gas flows on
detailed chemical evolution models (one-infall and two-infall) for the Milky
Way disk with different prescriptions for the infall law and star formation
rate. We found, that with a gas radial inflow of constant speed the metallicity
gradient tends to steepen. Taking into account a constant time scale for the
infall rate along the Galaxy disk and radial flows with a constant speed, we
obtained a too flat gradient, at variance with data, implying that an
inside-out formation and/or a variable gas flow speed are required. To
reproduce the observed gradients the gas flow should increase in modulus with
the galactocentric distance, both in the one-infall and two-infall models.
However, the inside-out disk formation coupled with a threshold in the gas
density (only in the two-infall model) for star formation and/or a variable
efficiency of star formation with galactocentric distance can also reproduce
the observed gradients without radial flows. We showed that the radial flows
can be the most important process in reproducing abundance gradients but only
with a variable gas speed. Finally, one should consider that uncertainties in
the data concerning gradients prevent us to draw firm conclusions. Future more
detailed data will help to ascertain whether the radial flows are a necessary
ingredient in the formation and evolution of the Galactic disk and disks in
general.

motivated and its current state of the art briefly reviewed, in particular for
the case of discrete choice making. The coupling of two binary choices is
studied in some detail, using an Ising model for each of the decision variables
(the opinion or choice moments or spins, socioeconomic equivalents to the
magnetic moments or spins). Toy models for two different types of coupling are
studied analytically and numerically in the mean field (infinite range)
approximation. This is equivalent to considering a social influence effect
proportional to the fraction of adopters or average magnetisation. In the
nonlocal case, the two spin variables are coupled through a Weiss mean field
type term. In a socioeconomic context, this can be useful when studying
individuals of two different groups, making the same decision under social
influence of their own group, when their outcome is affected by the fraction of
adopters of the other group. In the local case, the two spin variables are
coupled only through each individual. This accounts to considering individuals
of a single group each making two different choices which affect each other. In
both cases, only constant (intra- and inter-) couplings and external fields are
considered, i.e., only completely homogeneous populations. Most of the results
presented are for the zero field case, i.e. no externalities or private
utilities. Phase diagrams and their interpretation in a socioeconomic context
are discussed and compared to the uncoupled case. The two systems share many
common features including the existence of both first and second order phase
transitions, metastability and hysteresis. To conclude, some general remarks,
pointing out the limitations of these models and suggesting further
improvements are given.

window on the elusive high-redshift (z>1) cluster population. Well controlled
statistical samples of distant clusters will enable us to answer questions
about their cosmological context, early assembly phases and the thermodynamical
evolution of the intracluster medium. Aims: We report on the detection of two
z>1 systems, XMMU J0302.2-0001 and XMMU J1532.2-0836, as part of the XMM-Newton
Distant Cluster Project (XDCP) sample. We investigate the nature of the
sources, measure their spectroscopic redshift and determine their basic
physical parameters. Methods: The results of the present paper are based on the
analysis of XMM-Newton archival data, optical/near-infrared imaging and deep
optical follow-up spectroscopy of the clusters. Results: We confirm the X-ray
source XMMU J0302.2-0001 as a gravitationally bound, bona fide cluster of
galaxies at spectroscopic redshift z=1.185. We estimate its M500 mass to
(1.6+/-0.3) times 10^{14} Msun from its measured X-ray luminosity. This ranks
the cluster among intermediate mass system. In the case of XMMU J1532.2-0836 we
find the X-ray detection to be coincident with a dynamically bound system of
galaxies at z=1.358. Optical spectroscopy reveals the presence of a central
active galactic nucleus, which can be a dominant source of the detected X-ray
emission from this system. We provide upper limits of X-ray parameters for the
system and discuss cluster identification challenges in the high-redshift
low-mass cluster regime. A third, intermediate redshift (z=0.647) cluster, XMMU
J0302.1-0000, is serendipitously detected in the same field as XMMU
J0302.2-0001. We provide its analysis as well.

analyzed all available X-ray archived XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of 13
LINER 1s satisfying the above criterion in a systematic homogeneous way. We
looked for any correlations between the X-ray properties and the intrinsic

the spectra of 9 out of the 13 sources. A thermal component and an absorbed
power-law were required in the remaining 4 sources. We found a photon index
between 1.3\pm0.2 for the hardest source and 2.4^(+0.2)_(-0.3) for the softest
one with a mean value of 1.9\pm0.2 and a dispersion sigma=0.3. The thermal
component had a mean temperature kT~0.6 keV. Significant short (hours to days)
time-scale variability is not common in the present sample and was observed in
only 2 sources (NGC 3226 and NGC 4278). Three other sources indicate a possible
variability with a low K-S test probability (2%-4%) that the nuclear emission
originates from a constant source. Significant variability on months to years
time-scales is detected in 7 out of the 9 sources observed more than once. No
significant Fe K(alpha) emission line at 6.4 keV was detected and upper limits
were derived for the 4 sources with a high enough signal to noise ratio around
6 keV. Finally, we established, for the first time for a sample of LINER 1s,
that the photon index is significantly anticorrelated to L_(2-10 keV)/L_(Edd).
This anticorrelation is similar to the one seen in XRBs in their low/hard state
where a radiatively inefficient accretion flow is thought to be responsible for
the X-ray emitted energy.

impressive progress in the field of molecular electronics in the last decade. A
theoretical description of molecular contacts as the building blocks of future
devices is challenging though as it has to combine properties of Fermi liquids
in the leads with charge and phonon degrees of freedom on the molecule. Apart
from ab initio schemes for specific set-ups, generic models reveal
characteristics of transport processes. Particularly appealing are descriptions
based on transfer rates successfully used in other contexts such as mesoscopic
physics and intramolecular electron transfer. However, a detailed analysis of
this scheme in comparison with numerically exact data is elusive yet.
  It turns out that a formulation in terms of transfer rates provides a
quantitatively accurate description even in domains of parameter space where in
a strict sense it is expected to fail, e.g. for lower temperatures. Typically,
intramolecular phonons are distributed according to a voltage driven steady
state that can only roughly be captured by a thermal distribution with an
effective elevated temperature (heating). An extension of a master equation for
the charge-phonon complex to include effectively the impact of off-diagonal
elements of the reduced density matrix provides very accurate data even for
stronger electron-phonon coupling.

V-FASTR, an experiment to perform a blind search for fast transient radio
signals using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The experiment runs entirely
in a commensal mode, alongside normal VLBA observations and operations. It is
made possible by the features and flexibility of the DiFX software correlator

offers significant advantages over single-dish experiments, including a larger
field of view, the ability to easily distinguish local radio-frequency
interference from real signals and the possibility to localize detected events
on the sky to milliarcsecond accuracy. We describe our software pipeline, which
accepts short integration (~ms) spectrometer data from each antenna in real
time during correlation and performs an incoherent dedispersion separately for
each antenna, over a range of trial dispersion measures. The dedispersed data
are processed by a sophisticated detector and candidate events are recorded. At
the end of the correlation, small snippets of the raw data at the time of the
events are stored for further analysis. We present the results of our event

supermassive black holes is one of the most powerful probes of the accretion
flow physics and geometry, while also providing in principle observational
constraints on the black hole spin.[...] We aim at determining the ultimate
physical driver of the strength of this relativistic reprocessing feature. We
first extend the hard X-ray flux-limited sample of Seyfert galaxies studied so
far (FERO, de la Calle Perez et al. 2010) to obscured objects up to a column
density N_H=6x10^23 atoms/cm/cm. We verify that none of the line properties
depends on the AGN optical classification, as expected from the Seyfert
unification scenarios. There is also no correlation between the accretion disc
inclination, as derived from formal fits of the line profiles, and the optical
type or host galaxy aspect angle, suggesting that the innermost regions of the
accretion disc and the host galaxy plane are not aligned. [...]. Data are not
sensitive enough to the detailed ionisation state of the line-emitting disc.
However, the lack of dependency of the line EW on either the luminosity or the
rest-frame centroid energy rules out that disc ionisation plays an important
role on the EW dynamical range in Seyferts. The dynamical range of the
relativistically broadened K-alpha iron line EW in nearby Seyferts appears to
be mainly determined by the properties of the innermost accretion flow. We
discuss several mechanisms (disc ionisation, disc truncation, aberration due to
a mildly relativistic outflowing corona) which can explain this. [...]
Observational data are still not in contradiction with scenarios invoking
different mechanisms for the spectral complexity around the iron line, most
notably the ""partial covering"" absorption scenario. (abridged).

the conventional two-stage decoding, iterative decoding between the inner code

inverse-Gamma distribution as a default prior for a top-level scale parameter
in Bayesian hierarchical models, at least for cases where a proper prior is
necessary. Our arguments involve a blend of Bayesian and frequentist reasoning,
and are intended to complement the original case made by Gelman (2006) in
support of the folded-t family of priors. First, we generalize the half-Cauchy
prior to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive
expressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are
used for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. We go on
to prove a proposition that, together with the results for moments and
marginals, allows us to characterize the frequentist risk of the Bayes
estimators under all global-shrinkage priors in the class. These theoretical
results, in turn, allow us to study the frequentist properties of the
half-Cauchy prior versus a wide class of alternatives. The half-Cauchy occupies
a sensible 'middle ground' within this class: it performs very well near the
origin, but does not lead to drastic compromises in other parts of the
parameter space. This provides an alternative, classical justification for the
repeated, routine use of this prior. We also consider situations where the
underlying mean vector is sparse, where we argue that the usual conjugate
choice of an inverse-gamma prior is particularly inappropriate, and can lead to
highly distorted posterior inferences. Finally, we briefly summarize some open
issues in the specification of default priors for scale terms in hierarchical
models.

superconductors arises from AFM semimetals and can coexist with AFM orders2-9.
This key difference marked in their phase diagrams has raised many intriguing
debates about whether the two materials can be placed in the same category to
understand the mechanism of superconductivity. Recently, superconductivity at
32 K has been reported in iron-chalcogenide superconductors AxFe2-ySe2 (A=K,

insulating phases and reveal that the superconducting phase is sandwiched
between them, and give direct evidence that the superconductivity in AxFe2-ySe2
originates from the AFM insulating parent compounds. The two insulating phases
are characterized by two distinct superstructures caused by Fe vacancy orders
with modulation wave vectors of q1=(1/5, 3/5, 0) and q2=(1/4, 3/4, 0),
respectively. These experimental results strongly indicate that iron-based

four dimensional asymptotically flat non-degenerate black holes are in a
symmetry orbit of the Schwarzschild/Kerr black hole in a large set of theories
of gravity and matter. Their argument involved reducing the theory on a
time-like Killing vector field and analysing the resulting three dimensional
sigma model of maps to a symmetric space $G/H$. In the construction of their
proof, they conjectured the existence of a suitable $H$-transformation that
always remove the electromagnetic charges of the four dimensional black hole
solution. We show in this short note that such a transformation does not exist
in general, and discuss a set of boundary conditions on the horizon for the
scalar fields in the sigma model that yield black holes for which the result by
Breitenlohner, Maison and Gibbons can be applied.

given well-defined meaning. The perspective of Semantic Web is to promote the
quality and intelligence of the current web by changing its contents into
machine understandable form. Therefore, semantic level information is one of
the cornerstones of the Semantic Web. The process of adding semantic metadata
to web resources is called Semantic Annotation. There are many obstacles
against the Semantic Annotation, such as multilinguality, scalability, and
issues which are related to diversity and inconsistency in content of different
web pages. Due to the wide range of domains and the dynamic environments that
the Semantic Annotation systems must be performed on, the problem of automating
annotation process is one of the significant challenges in this domain. To
overcome this problem, different machine learning approaches such as supervised
learning, unsupervised learning and more recent ones like, semi-supervised
learning and active learning have been utilized. In this paper we present an
inclusive layered classification of Semantic Annotation challenges and discuss
the most important issues in this field. Also, we review and analyze machine
learning applications for solving semantic annotation problems. For this goal,
the article tries to closely study and categorize related researches for better
understanding and to reach a framework that can map machine learning techniques
into the Semantic Annotation challenges and requirements.

Updated in line with new version of arXiv:1001.0023","Surveys in Differential Geometry 17, 2012, 299-325",,,"math.DG math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is a survey of the author's paper arXiv:1001.0023 on ""Algebraic Geometry
over C-infinity rings"".
  If X is a smooth manifold then the R-algebra C^\infty(X) of smooth functions
c : X --> R is a ""C-infinity ring"". That is, for each smooth function f : R^n
--> R there is an n-fold operation \Phi_f : C^\infty(X)^n --> C^\infty(X)
acting by \Phi_f: (c_1,...,c_n) |--> f(c_1,...,c_n), and these operations
\Phi_f satisfy many natural identities. Thus, C^\infty(X) actually has a far
richer structure than the obvious R-algebra structure.
  We explain a version of algebraic geometry in which rings or algebras are
replaced by C-infinity rings. As schemes are the basic objects in algebraic
geometry, the new basic objects are ""C-infinity schemes"", a category of
geometric objects generalizing manifolds, and whose morphisms generalize smooth
maps. We also discuss ""C-infinity stacks"", including Deligne-Mumford C-infinity
stacks, a 2-category of geometric objects generalizing orbifolds. We study
quasicoherent and coherent sheaves on C-infinity schemes and C-infinity stacks,
and orbifold strata of Deligne-Mumford C-infinity stacks. This enables us to
use the tools of algebraic geometry in differential geometry, and to describe
singular spaces such as moduli spaces occurring in differential geometric
problems.
  Many of these ideas are not new: C-infinity rings and C-infinity schemes have
long been part of synthetic differential geometry. But we develop them in new
directions. In a new book, surveyed in arXiv:1206.4207 and at greater length in
arXiv:1208.4948, the author uses C-infinity algebraic geometry to develop a
theory of ""derived differential geometry"", which studies ""d-manifolds"" and
""d-orbifolds"", derived versions of smooth manifolds and orbifolds. D-orbifolds
will have applications in symplectic geometry, as the geometric structure on
moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves.

classification and synthesis of stellar populations. MILES is a medium
spectral-resolution library in the optical domain covering a wide range of
temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities. Aims. We re-determine the
atmospheric parameters of these stars in order to improve the homogeneity and
accuracy. We build an interpolating function that returns a spectrum as a
function of the three atmospheric parameters, and finally, we characterize the
precision of the wavelength calibration and stability of the spectral
resolution. Methods. We use the ULySS program with the ELODIE library as a
reference and compare the results with literature compilations. Results. We
obtain precisions of 60 K, 0.13 and 0.05 dex respectively for Teff, log g and
[Fe/H] for the FGK stars. For the M stars, the mean errors are 38 K, 0.26 and
0.12 dex, and for the OBA 3.5%, 0.17 and 0.13 dex. We construct an interpolator
that we test against the MILES stars themselves. We test it also by measuring
the atmospheric parameters of the CFLIB stars with MILES as reference and find
it to be more reliable than the ELODIE interpolator for the evolved hot stars,
like in particular those of the blue horizontal branch.

polynomial system using the recently proposed algorithm BISOLVE. BISOLVE is a
classical elimination method which first projects the solutions of a system
onto the $x$- and $y$-axes and, then, selects the actual solutions from the so
induced candidate set. However, unlike similar algorithms, BISOLVE requires no
genericity assumption on the input nor it needs any change of the coordinate
system. Furthermore, extensive benchmarks from \cite{bes-bisolve-2011} confirm
that the algorithm outperforms state of the art approaches by a large factor.
In this work, we show that, for two polynomials $f,g\in\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ of
total degree at most $n$ with integer coefficients bounded by $2^\tau$, BISOLVE
computes isolating boxes for all real solutions of the system $f=g=0$ using
$\Otilde(n^8\tau^{2})$ bit operations, thereby improving the previous record
bound by a factor of at least $n^{2}$.

spin-Hall conductivity have distinct values in different direction. On a
noncommutative space we derive the spin-depended electric current whose

Attractor (SNA) in a quasiperiodically forced Chua's circuit. In this study the
amplitude of one of the external driving forces is considered as the control
parameter. By varying this control parameter, we find that bubbles appear in
the strands of the torus. These bubbles start to double in number as the
control parameter is increased. On increasing the parameter continuously,
successive doubling of the bubbles occurs, leading to the birth of SNAs. We
call this mechanism as the bubble doubling mechanism. The formation of SNA
through this bubble doubling route is confirmed numerically, using Poincar\'e
maps, maximal Lyapunov exponent and its variance and the distribution of
finite-time Lyapunov exponents. Also a quantitative confirmation of the strange
nonchaotic dynamics is carried out with the help of singular continuous
spectrum analysis.
