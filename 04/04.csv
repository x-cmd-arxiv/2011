into account the angular size of the dSphs; while nearby objects have higher
gamma ray flux, their larger angular extent can make them less attractive
targets for background-dominated instruments. (ii) We derive DM profiles and
the astrophysical J-factor (which parameterises the expected gamma-ray flux,
independently of the choice of DM particle model) for the classical dSphs
directly from photometric and kinematic data. We assume very little about the
DM profile, modelling this as a smooth split-power law distribution, with and
without sub-clumps. (iii) We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to
marginalise over unknown parameters and determine the sensitivity of our
derived J-factors to both model and measurement uncertainties. (iv) We use
simulated DM profiles to demonstrate that our J-factor determinations recover
the correct solution within our quoted uncertainties. Our key findings are: (i)
Sub-clumps in the dSphs do not usefully boost the signal; (ii) The sensitivity
of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes to dSphs within 20 kpc with cored halos can
be up to ~50 times worse than when estimated assuming them to be point-like.
Even for the satellite-borne Fermi-LAT the sensitivity is significantly
degraded on the relevant angular scales for long exposures, hence it is vital
to consider the angular extent of the dSphs when selecting targets; (iii) No DM
profile has been ruled out by current data, but using a prior on the inner dark
matter cusp slope 0<=gamma<=1 provides J-factor estimates accurate to a factor
of a few if an appropriate angular scale [abridged]

combination of optical/UV colour and stellar surface mass density. We therefore
build a control sample of non-AGN matched to the AGN hosts in these two
properties. We study trends in HI gas mass fraction (M(HI)/M_*), where M_* is
the stellar mass) as a function of black hole accretion rate indicator
L[OIII]/M(BH). We find no significant difference in HI content between AGN and
control samples at all values of black hole accretion rate probed by the
galaxies in our sample. This indicates that AGN do not influence the
large-scale gaseous properties of galaxies in the local Universe. We have
studied the variation in HI mass fraction with black hole accretion rate in the
blue and red galaxy populations. In the blue population, the HI gas fraction is
independent of accretion rate, indicating that accretion is not sensitive to
the properties of the interstellar medium of the galaxy on large scales.
However, in the red population accretion rate and gas fraction do correlate.
The measured gas fractions in this population are not too different from the
ones expected from a stellar mass loss origin, implying that the fuel supply in
the red AGN population could be a mixture of mass loss from stars and gas

that multiple soft-decisions become available at various processing stages. A
tricky issue is that these multiple decisions from different pipeline stages
have varying levels of reliability. This paper establishes an effective
strategy for the channel estimator to track the target channel, while dealing
with observation sets with different qualities. The resulting algorithm is
basically a linear sequential estimation algorithm and, as such, is
Kalman-based in nature. The main difference here, however, is that the proposed
algorithm employs puncturing on observation samples to effectively deal with
the inherent correlation among the multiple demapper/decoder module outputs
that cannot easily be removed by the traditional innovations approach. The
proposed algorithm continuously monitors the quality of the feedback decisions
and incorporates it in the channel estimation process. The proposed channel
estimation scheme shows clear performance advantages relative to existing
channel estimation techniques.

considered. The relay observes a linear combination of the source signals and
broadcasts a common message to the two destinations, through a perfect link of
fixed limited rate $R_0$ bits per channel use. The out-of-band nature of the
relay is reflected by the fact that the common relay message does not interfere
with the received signal at the two destinations. A general achievable rate is
established, along with upper bounds on the capacity region for the Gaussian
case. For $R_0$ values below a certain threshold, which depends on channel
parameters, the capacity region of this channel is determined in this paper to
within a constant gap of $\Delta=1.95$ bits. We identify interference regimes
where a two-for-one gain in achievable rates is possible for every bit relayed,
up to a constant approximation error. Instrumental to these results is a
carefully-designed quantize-and-forward type of relay strategy along with a
joint decoding scheme employed at destination ends. Further, we also study
successive decoding strategies with optimal decoding order (corresponding to
the order at which common, private, and relay messages are decoded), and show
that successive decoding also achieves two-for-one gains asymptotically in
regimes where a two-for-one gain is achievable by joint decoding; yet,
successive decoding produces unbounded loss asymptotically when compared to
joint decoding, in general.

that the mass (volume) distribution of atmospheric PM elemental components is a
log normal distribution, which on a logarithmic scale with respect to the

This means that the parameters of two-dimensional normal distribution with
respect to corresponding atmospheric PM-multifractal elemental components

matter content of the Universe be treated as a classical gravitating fluid of
positive pressure, but, together with all its other physical characteristics,
the energy of this fluid's internal motions should be taken into account as a
source of the universal gravitational field. This form of energy can compensate
for the extra (dark) energy, needed to compromise spatial flatness, while the
post-recombination Universe remains ever-decelerating. At the same time (i.e.,
in the context of the collisional-DM approach), the theoretical curve
representing the distance modulus as a function of the cosmological redshift,
{\mu}(z), fits the Hubble diagram of a multi-used sample of supernova Ia events
quite accurately. A cosmological model filled with collisional DM could
accommodate the majority of the currently-available observational data
(including, also, those from baryon acoustic oscillations), without the need
for either any dark energy (DE) or the cosmological constant. However, as we
demonstrate, this is not the case for someone who, although living in a
Universe filled with self-interacting DM, insists on adopting the traditional,
collisionless-DM approach. From the point of view of this observer, the
cosmologically-distant light-emitting sources seem to lie farther (i.e., they
appear to be dimmer) than expected, while the Universe appears to be either
accelerating or decelerating, depending on the value of the cosmological
redshift. This picture, which, nowadays, represents the common perception in
observational cosmology, acquires a more conventional interpretation within the
context of the collisional-DM approach.

problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this context, the
fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and
compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric regression against outliers -
that is, data markedly deviating from the postulated models. A variational
counterpart to least-trimmed squares regression is shown closely related to an
L0-(pseudo)norm-regularized estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector
explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers
based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type
estimator equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization
parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier vector
along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced bias and
enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of an improved
estimator obtained after replacing the L0-(pseudo)norm with a nonconvex
surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is adopted to cleanse load
curve data, a key task aiding operational decisions in the envisioned smart
grid system. Computer simulations and tests on real load curve data corroborate
the effectiveness of the novel sparsity-controlling robust estimators.

to GRBs in which the disk of material surrounding the black hole (BH) powering
the GRB jet modulates the mass flow, and hence the strength of the jet. Given
the initial existence of a small mass <10^{-4} msun near the progenitor with a
circularization radius ~10^{10}-10^{11} cm, an unavoidable consequence will be
the formation of an ""external disk"" whose outer edge continually moves to
larger radii due to angular momentum transport and lack of a confining torque.
For long GRBs, if the mass distribution in the initial fall-back disk traces
the progenitor envelope, then a radius ~10^{11} cm gives a time scale ~10^4 s
for the X-ray plateau. For late times t>10^7 s a steepening due to a cooling
front in the disk may have observational support in GRB 060729. For short GRBs,
one expects most of the mass initially to lie at small radii <10^8 cm; however
the presence of even a trace amount ~10^{-9} msun of high angular momentum
material can give a brief plateau in the light curve. By studying the plateaus
in the X-ray decay of GRBs, which can last up to ~10^4 s after the prompt
emission, Dainotti et al. find an apparent inverse relation between the X-ray
luminosity at the end of the plateau and the duration of the plateau. We show
that this relation may simply represent the fact that one is biased against
detecting faint plateaus, and therefore preferentially sampling the more
energetic GRBs. If, however, there were a standard reservoir in fall-back mass,
our model can reproduce the inverse X-ray luminosity-duration relation. We
emphasize that we do not address the very steep, initial decays immediately
following the prompt emission, which have been modeled by Lindner et al. as
fall-back of the progenitor core, and may entail the accretion of > 1 msun.

coalition game theoretic approach. We first consider a generalized coalition
structure consisting of multiple providers with many assisting peers, where
peers assist providers to reduce the operational cost in content distribution.
To distribute the profit from cost reduction to players (i.e., providers and
peers), we then establish a generalized formula for individual payoffs when a
""Shapley-like"" payoff mechanism is adopted. We show that the grand coalition is
unstable, even when the operational cost functions are concave, which is in
sharp contrast to the recently studied case of a single provider where the
grand coalition is stable. We also show that irrespective of stability of the
grand coalition, there always exist coalition structures which are not
convergent to the grand coalition under a dynamic among coalition structures.
Our results give us an incontestable fact that a provider does not tend to
cooperate with other providers in peer-assisted services, and be separated from
them. Three facets of the noncooperative (selfish) providers are illustrated;
(i) underpaid peers, (ii) service monopoly, and (iii) oscillatory coalition
structure. Lastly, we propose a stable payoff mechanism which improves fairness
of profit-sharing by regulating the selfishness of the players as well as
grants the content providers a limited right of realistic bargaining. Our study
opens many new questions such as realistic and efficient incentive structures
and the tradeoffs between fairness and individual providers' competition in

accurate models about aggregated data without access to precise information in
individual data record. A widely studied \emph{perturbation-based PPDM}
approach introduces random perturbation to individual values to preserve
privacy before data is published. Previous solutions of this approach are
limited in their tacit assumption of single-level trust on data miners.
  In this work, we relax this assumption and expand the scope of
perturbation-based PPDM to Multi-Level Trust (MLT-PPDM). In our setting, the
more trusted a data miner is, the less perturbed copy of the data it can
access. Under this setting, a malicious data miner may have access to
differently perturbed copies of the same data through various means, and may
combine these diverse copies to jointly infer additional information about the
original data that the data owner does not intend to release. Preventing such
\emph{diversity attacks} is the key challenge of providing MLT-PPDM services.
We address this challenge by properly correlating perturbation across copies at
different trust levels. We prove that our solution is robust against diversity
attacks with respect to our privacy goal. That is, for data miners who have
access to an arbitrary collection of the perturbed copies, our solution prevent
them from jointly reconstructing the original data more accurately than the
best effort using any individual copy in the collection. Our solution allows a
data owner to generate perturbed copies of its data for arbitrary trust levels
on-demand. This feature offers data owners maximum flexibility.

The
first concerns the question of the holomorphy of the coupling, and related to
this the possible definition of an exact (NSVZ) beta function. The second
concerns instantons in pure gluodynamics, which appear to give sensible, exact
results for certain correlation functions, which nonetheless differ from those
obtained using systematic weak coupling expansions. For the first question, we
extend an earlier proposal of Arkani-Hamed and Murayama, showing that if their
regulated action is written suitably, the holomorphy of the couplings is
manifest, and it is easy to determine the renormalization scheme for which the
NSVZ formula holds. This scheme, however, is seen to be one of an infinite
class of schemes, each leading to an exact beta function; the NSVZ scheme,
while simple, is not selected by any compelling physical consideration. For the
second question, we explain why the instanton computation in the pure
supersymmetric gauge theory is not reliable, even at short distances. The
semiclassical expansion about the instanton is purely formal; if infrared
divergences appear, they spoil arguments based on holomorphy. We demonstrate
that infrared divergences do not occur in the perturbation expansion about the
instanton, but explain that there is no reason to think this captures all
contributions from the sector with unit topological charge. That one expects
additional contributions is illustrated by dilute gas corrections. These are
infrared divergent, and so difficult to define, but if non-zero give order one,
holomorphic, corrections to the leading result. Exploiting an earlier analysis
of Davies et al, we demonstrate that in the theory compactified on a circle of
radius beta, due to infrared effects, finite contributions indeed arise which
are not visible in the formal limit that beta goes to infinity.

ring. This propeller structure is thought to be formed by gravitational
scattering of ring particles by an unseen embedded moonlet. Self-gravity wakes
are prevalent in dense rings due to gravitational instability. Strong
gravitational wakes affect the propeller structure. Here, we derive the
condition for formation of a propeller structure by a moonlet embedded in a
dense ring with gravitational wakes. We find that a propeller structure is
formed when the wavelength of the gravitational wakes is smaller than the Hill
radius of the moonlet. We confirm this formation condition by performing
numerical simulations. This condition is consistent with observations of
propeller structures in Saturn's A ring.

obstacle scattering problems with a single incident wave whose governing
equation is given by the Helmholtz equation in two dimensions. It is concerned
with the indicator function in the Enclosure Method. The previous indicator
function is essentially real-valued since only its absolute value is used. In
this paper, another method for the use of the indicator function is introduced.
The method employs the logarithmic differential with respect to the independent
variable of the indicator function and yields directly the coordinates of the
vertices of the convex hull of unknown polygonal sound-hard obstacles or thin
ones. The convergence rate of the formulae is better than that of the previous
indicator function. Some other applications of this method are also given.

M81 group dIrr post-starburst galaxy DDO 165. The HI morphology is complex,
with multiple column density peaks surrounding a large region of very low HI
surface density that is offset from the center of the stellar distribution. The
bulk of the neutral gas is associated with the southern section of the galaxy;
a secondary peak in the north contains ~15% of the total HI mass. These
components appear to be kinematically distinct, suggesting that either tidal
processes or large-scale blowout have recently shaped the ISM of DDO 165. Using
spatially-resolved position-velocity maps, we find multiple localized
high-velocity gas features. Cross-correlating with radius-velocity analyses, we
identify eight shell/hole structures in the ISM with a range of sizes (~400-900
pc) and expansion velocities (~7-11 km/s). These structures are compared with
narrow- and broad-band imaging from KPNO and HST. Using the latter data, recent
works have shown that DDO 165's previous ""burst"" phase was extended temporally
(>1 Gyr). We thus interpret the high-velocity gas features, HI holes, and
kinematically distinct components of the galaxy in the context of the immediate
effects of ""feedback"" from recent star formation. In addition to creating HI
holes and shells, extended star formation events are capable of creating
localized high velocity motion of the surrounding interstellar material. A
companion paper connects the energetics from the HI and HST data.

identified two kinematically distinct HI components, multiple localized high

spans ~2.2x1.1 kpc). Using the spatial and temporal information from the
stellar populations in DDO 165, we compare the patterns of star formation over
the past 500 Myr with the HI dynamics. We extract localized star formation
histories within 6 of the 8 HI holes identified in Paper I, as well as 23 other
regions that sample a range of stellar densities and neutral gas properties.
From population synthesis modeling, we derive the energy outputs (from stellar
winds and supernovae) of the stellar populations within these regions over the
last 100 Myr, and compare with refined estimates of the energies required to
create the HI holes. In all cases, we find that ""feedback"" is energetically
capable of creating the observed structures in the ISM. Numerous regions with
significant energy inputs from feedback lack coherent HI structures but show
prominent localized high velocity gas features; this feedback signature is a
natural product of temporally and spatially distributed star formation. In DDO
165, the extended period of heightened star formation activity (lasting more
than 1 Gyr) is energetically capable of creating the observed holes and high
velocity gas features in the neutral ISM.

a graph to hypergraphs. We present three different interpretations of those
complexes -- a purely combinatorial one and two geometric ones. It is shown,
that most of the properties, which are known to be true for coloring complexes
of graphs, break down in this more general setting, e.g., Cohen-Macaulayness
and partitionabilty. Nevertheless, we are able to provide bounds for the $f$-
and $h$-vectors of those complexes which yield new bounds on chromatic
polynomials of hypergraphs. Moreover, it is shown that the coloring complex of
a hypergraph has a wedge decomposition, though we conjecture that in general
this decomposition is not homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. In
addition, we can completely characterize those hypergraphs whose coloring
complex is connected.

wave ordering occurs, in agreement with experiments. At larger pressures the
disappearing of the charge density wave is due to a stiffening of the

has some limitations, which are consequence of the fact that in the original
formulation, strategies are abstractions of MALL proofs. On one side, no
repetitions are allowed. On the other side, the proofs tend to rely on the very
specific properties of the MALL proof-like strategies, making it difficult to
transfer the approach to semantical types into different settings. In this
paper, we provide an extension of ludics which allows repetitions and show that
one can still have interactive types and internal completeness. From this, we
obtain full completeness w.r.t. a polarized version of MELL. In our extension,
we use less properties than in the original formulation, which we believe is of
independent interest. We hope this may open the way to applications of ludics
approach to larger domains and different settings.

channel to Type Ia Supernova explosions, based on the high mass of the
accreting white dwarf. Additional support to this hypothesis has been recently
provided by the detection of circumstellar material around SN2006X and
SN2007le, showing a structure compatible with that expected for recurrent nova
outbursts.In this paper we investigate the circumstellar environment of RS Oph
and its structure, with the aim of establishing a firmer and independent link
between this class of objects and Type Ia SN progenitors.
  Methods: We study the time evolution of CaII, NaI and KI absorption features
in RS Oph, before, during, and after the last outburst, using multi-epoch,
high-resolution spectroscopy, and applying the same method adopted for SN2006X
and SN2007le.
  Results: A number of components, blue-shifted with respect to the systemic
velocity of RS Oph, are detected. In particular, one feature strongly weakens
in the first two weeks after the outburst, simultaneously with the
disappearance of very narrow P-Cyg profiles overimposed on the much wider nova
emission lines of H, He, FeII and other elements.
  Conclusions: We interpret these facts as the signature of density
enhancements in the circumstellar material, suggesting that the recurrent
eruptions might indeed create complex structures within the material lost by
the donor star. This establishes a strong link between RS Oph and the
progenitor system of the Type Ia SN2006X, for which similar features have been
detected.

~10^7 M_O, over individual regions of order 10 sq deg in size, out to a maximum
velocity of 18,000 km s^-1. Each surveyed region is centred on a nearby galaxy,
group or cluster, in this instance the NGC7448 group. Galaxy interactions in
the NGC7448 group reveal themselves through the identification of tidal tails
and bridges. We find ~2.5 times more atomic gas in the inter-galactic medium
than in the group galaxies. We identify five new dwarf galaxies, two of which
appear to be members of the NGC7448 group. This is too few, by roughly an order
of magnitude, dwarf galaxies to reconcile observation with theoretical
predictions of galaxy formation models. If they had observed this region of sky
previous wide area blind HI surveys, HIPASS and ALFALFA, would have detected
only 5% and 43% respectively of the galaxies we detect, missing a large
fraction of the atomic gas in this volume. We combine the data from this paper
with that from our other AGES papers (370 galaxies) to derive a HI mass
function with the following Schechter function parameters alpha=-1.52+/-0.05,
M^*=5.1+/-0.3x10^9 h_72^-2 M_O, phi=8.6+/-1.1x10-3 h_72^3 Mpc^-3 dex-1.
Integrating the mass function leads to a cosmic mass density of atomic hydrogen
of Omega_HI=5.3+/-0.8x10^-4 h_72^-1. Our mass function is steeper than that
found by both HIPASS and ALFALFA (alpha=1.37 and 1.33 respectively), while our
cosmic mass density is consistent with ALFALFA, but 1.7 times larger than found
by HIPASS.

previous beryllium abundance studies. The complete sample consists of 70 stars
hosting planets and 30 stars without known planetary companions. The aim of
this paper is to further assess the trends found in previous studies with less
number of objects. This will provide more information on the processes of
depletion and mixing of light elements in the interior of late type stars, and
will provide possible explanations for the abundance differences between stars
that host planets and ""single"" stars. Methods: Using high resolution UVES
spectra, we measure beryllium abundances of 26 stars that host planets and 1
""single"" star mainly using the lambda 3131.065 A Be II line, by fitting
synthetic spectra to the observational data. We also compile beryllium
abundance measurements of 44 stars hosting planets and 29 ""single"" stars from

that the beryllium content is roughly the same in stars hosting planets and in
""single"" stars at temperatures Teff > 5700K. The sample is still small for Teff
< 5500K, but it seems that the scatter in Be abundances of dwarf stars is
slightly higher at these cooler temperatures. Conclusions: We search for

abundance versus Li abundance, age, metallicity and oxygen abundance. These
could provide some insight in the formation and evolution of planetary systems,

influence, superfluid-insulator (Mott) transitions in the S=0 Bose Hubbard
model at unit filling are studied on the square and triangular lattices, using
a variational Monte Carlo method. In trial many-body wave functions, we
introduce various types of attractive correlation factors between a
doubly-occupied site (doublon, D) and an empty site (holon, H), which play a
central role for Mott transitions, in addition to the onsite repulsive
(Gutzwiller) factor. By optimizing distance-dependent parameters, we study
various properties of this type of wave functions. With a hint from the Mott
transition arising in a completely D-H bound state, we propose an improved
picture of Mott transitions, by introducing two characteristic length scales,
the D-H binding length $\xi_{\rm dh}$ and the minimum D-D exclusion length
$\xi_{\rm dd}$. Generally, a Mott transition occurs when $\xi_{\rm dh}$ becomes
comparable to $\xi_{\rm dd}$. In the conductive (superfluid) state, domains of
D-H pairs overlap with each other ($\xi_{\rm dh}>\xi_{\rm dd}$); thereby D and
H can propagate independently as density carriers by successively exchanging
the partners. In contrast, intersite repulsive Jastrow (D-D and H-H) factors
have little importance for the Mott transition.

galaxies, by studying NGC 891, the prototype of edge-on spiral galaxies. The
most important challenge for the models considered so far was the observed
increase of [OIII]/Hbeta, [OII]/Hbeta, and [NII]/Halpha with increasing
distance to the galactic plane. We propose a scenario based on the expected
population of massive OB stars and hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) in this
galaxy to explain this observational fact. In the framework of this scenario we
construct a finely meshed grid of photoionization models. For each value of the
galactic latitude z we look for the models which simultaneously fit the
observed values of the [OIII]/Hbeta, [OII]/Hbeta, and [NII]/Halpha ratios. For
each value of z we find a range of solutions which depends on the value of the
oxygen abundance. The models which fit the observations indicate a systematic
decrease of the electron density with increasing z. They become dominated by
the HOLMES with increasing z only when restricting to solar oxygen abundance
models, which argues that the metallicity above the galactic plane should be
close to solar. They also indicate that N/O increases with increasing z.

of astrophysics, and particularly for the evolution of proto-stellar
environments and the formation of planets. Aims. The formation of the first
layer of ice on carbon grains requires low temperatures compared to the
temperature of evaporation (T > 100 K). This asymmetry generates a zone in
which bare and icy dust grains coexist. Methods. We use Monte-Carlo simulations
to describe the formation time scales of ice mantles on bare grains in
protostellar disks and massive protostars environments. Then we analytically
describe these two systems in terms of grain populations subject to infall and
turbulence, and assume steady-state. Results. Our results show that there is an
extended region beyond the snow line where icy and bare grains can coexist, in
both proto-planetary disks and massive protostars. This zone is not negligible
compared to the total size of the objects: on the order of 0.4 AU for
proto-planetary disks and 5400 AU for high-mass protostars. Times to reach the
steady-state are respectively es- timated from 10^2 to 10^5 yr. Conclusions.
The presence of a zone, a so-called snow border, in which bare and icy grains
co- exist can have a major impact on our knowledge of protostellar
environments. From a theoretical point of view, the progression of icy grains
to bare grains as the temperature increases, could be a realistic way to model
hot cores and hot corinos. Also, in this zone, the formation of planetesimals
will require the coagulation of bare and icy grains. Observationally, this zone
allows high abundances of gas phase species at large scales, for massive
protostars particularly, even at low temperatures (down to 50 K).

parallel or zigzag stripe arrangements and exposed to an additional external
magnetic field that oscillates in time. For the case of parallel stripes we
find that the magnitude and direction of the particle current is controlled by
the tilt angle of the external magnetic field. The effect is reliably obtained
in a wide range of ratios between temperature and magnetic permeability.
Particle transport is achieved only when the period of oscillation of the
external field is greater than a critical value. For the case of zigzag stripes
a current is obtained using an oscillating external field normal to the
substrate. In this case, transport is only possible in the vertex of the
zigzag, giving rise to a narrow stream of particles. The magnitude and
direction of the particle current are found to be controlled by a combination
of the zigzag angle and the distance of the colloids from the substrate.
Metropolis Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations predict results that
are in good agreement with each other. Using kinetic Monte Carlo we find that

oblivious to the actual channel state realization. Herein it is established
that a distortion constraint for channel state estimation can be reduced to an
additional cost constraint on the source input distribution, in the limit of
large coding block length. A newly defined capacity-distortion function thus
characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between transmission rate and state
estimation distortion. It is also shown that non-coherent communication coupled
with channel state estimation conditioned on treating the decoded message as
training symbols achieves the capacity-distortion function. Among the various
examples considered, the capacity-distortion function for a memoryless Rayleigh
fading channel is characterized to within 1.443 bits at high signal-to-noise

access channels, leading to a coupled cost constraint on the input

ionization is taken into account. Heavy atoms ($Z_N >$ few) in the interstellar
medium which start the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) are never fully
ionized at the moment of injection. The ionization occurs during the
acceleration process, when atoms already move relativistically. For typical
environment around SNRs the photo-ionization due to the background galactic
radiation dominates over Coulomb collisions. The main consequence of ionization
is the reduction of the maximum energy which ions can achieve with respect to
the standard result of the DSA. In fact the photo-ionization has a timescale
comparable to the beginning of the Sedov-Taylor phase, hence the maximum energy
is no more proportional to the nuclear charge, as predicted by standard DSA,
but rather to the effective ions' charge during the acceleration process, which
is smaller than the total nuclear charge $Z_N$. This result can have a direct
consequence in the prediction of the knee structure of the cosmic ray spectrum.
Moreover the acceleration of ultra-heavy elements beyond the Iron's maximum
energy is very hard to achieve making unlikely their possible contribution to
the cosmic ray spectrum in the transition region between Galactic and
extragalactic component.

Due to the higher derivative terms, the solution describing the unification can

Therefore we can construct a model describing the time development, which
cannot be realized by a usual inflaton or quintessence models of the canonical

clearly detected at radio wavelengths but barely detected or undetected at
optical and infrared wavelengths, with 5 sigma sensitivities as low as 1 uJy.
Aims. Recent SED-modelling and analysis of their radio properties shows that
IFRS are consistent with a population of (potentially extremely obscured)
high-redshift AGN at 3<z<6. We demonstrate some astrophysical implications of
this population and compare them to predictions from models of galaxy evolution
and structure formation.
  Methods. We compiled a list of IFRS from four deep extragalactic surveys and
extrapolated the IFRS number density to a survey-independent value of (30.8 +-
15.0) per square degree. We computed the IFRS contribution to the total number
of AGN in the Universe to account for the Cosmic X-ray Background. By
estimating the black hole mass contained in IFRS, we present conclusions for
the SMBH mass density in the early universe and compare it to relevant
simulations of structure formation after the Big Bang.
  Results. The number density of AGN derived from the IFRS density was found to
be about 310 deg^-2, which is equivalent to a SMBH mass density of the order of
10^3 M_sun Mpc^-3 in the redshift range 3<z<6. This produces an X-ray flux of 9
10^-16 W m^-2 deg^-2 in the 0.5-2.0 keV band and 3 10^-15 W m^-2 deg^-2 in the
2.0-10 keV band, in agreement with the missing unresolved components of the
Cosmic X-ray Background. Concerning the problem of SMBH formation after the Big
Bang we find evidence for a scenario involving both halo gas accretion and
major mergers.

We concentrate on the production of large two-pion invariant masses where the
mechanism of the elementary $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ process is not fully
understood. In order to include a size of nuclei we perform calculation in the
impact-parameter equivalent photon approximation (EPA). Realistic charge
densities are used to calculate charged form factor of $^{208}$Pb nucleus and
to generate photon fluxes associated with ultrarelativistic heavy ions.
Sizeable cross sections are obtained that can be measured at LHC. The cross
section for elementary $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ is calculated in the
framework of pQCD Brodsky-Lepage (BL) mechanism with the distribution amplitude
used to descibe recent data of the BABAR collaboration on pion transition form
factor, using hand-bag mechanism advocated to describe recent Belle data as
well as $t$ and $u$-channel meson/reggeon exchanges. We present distributions
in two-pion invariant mass as well as the pion pair rapidity for the nuclear

by nodes (users) interconnected with one another via communication links. In
this regard, the security of individual nodes depend not only on their own
efforts, but also on the efforts and underlying connectivity structure of
neighboring network nodes. By the term 'effort', we imply the amount of
investments made by a user in security mechanisms like antivirus softwares,
firewalls, etc., to improve its security. However, often due to the large
magnitude of such networks, it is not always possible for nodes to have
complete effort and connectivity structure information about all their neighbor
nodes. Added to this is the fact that in many applications, the Internet users
are selfish and are not willing to co-operate with other users on sharing
effort information. In this paper, we adopt a non-cooperative game-theoretic
approach to analyze individual user security in a communication network by
accounting for both, the partial information that a network node possess about
its underlying neighborhood connectivity structure, as well as the presence of
positive externalities arising from efforts exerted by neighboring nodes. We
investigate the equilibrium behavior of nodes and show 1) the existence of
symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibria of efforts and 2) better connected nodes
choose lower efforts to exert but earn higher utilities with respect to
security improvement irrespective of the nature of node degree correlations
amongst the neighboring nodes. Our results provide ways for Internet users to
appropriately invest in security mechanisms under realistic environments of

networks and model them by continuous-time random walks (CTRW) and
continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), respectively. We calculate the classical
and quantum transition probabilities between two nodes of the network. We
numerically show that there is a high probability to find the walker at the
initial node for CTQWs on the underlying networks due to the interference
phenomenon, even for long times. To get global information (independent of the
starting node) about the transport efficiency, we average the return
probability over all nodes of the network. We apply the decay rate and the
asymptotic value of the average of the return probability to evaluate the
transport efficiency. Our numerical results prove that the existence of the
symmetry in the underlying networks makes quantum transport less efficient than
the classical one. In addition, we find that the increasing of the symmetry of
these networks decreases the efficiency of quantum transport on them.

temperature can give rise to poloidal variation in the density of impurities.
At the same time, the flow of the impurity species is modified relative to the
conventional neoclassical result. In this paper, these changes to the density
and flow of a collisional impurity species are calculated for the case when the
main ions are in the plateau regime. In this regime it is found that the
impurity density can be higher at either the inboard or outboard side. This
finding differs from earlier results for banana- or Pfirsch-Schl\""uter-regime
main ions, in which case the impurity density is always higher at the inboard
side in the absence of rotation. Finally, the modifications to the impurity
flow are also given for the other regimes of main-ion collisionality.

performance. Their iterative threshold increases with their average degree, or
with the size of the coupling window in randomized constructions. In the later
case, as the window size grows, the Belief Propagation (BP) threshold attains
the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. In this
contribution we show that a similar phenomenon happens for the growth rate of
coupled ensembles. Loosely speaking, we observe that as the coupling strength
grows, the growth rate of the coupled ensemble comes close to the concave hull
of the underlying ensemble's growth rate. For ensembles randomly coupled across
a window the growth rate actually tends to the concave hull of the underlying
one as the window size increases. Our observations are supported by the
calculations of the combinatorial growth rate, and that of the growth rate
derived from the replica method. The observed concavity is a general feature of
coupled mean field graphical models and is already present at the level of
coupled Curie-Weiss models. There, the canonical free energy of the coupled
system tends to the concave hull of the underlying one. As we explain, the
behavior of the growth rate of coupled ensembles is exactly analogous.

analogy with the Higgs mechanism. In (anti)-de Sitter backgrounds, the symmetry
can be broken spontaneously, but in flat backgrounds radiative corrections, at
the two loop level, break the Weyl symmetry a la Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We
also construct the Weyl invariant extensions of some other higher derivative
models, such as the Gauss-Bonnet theory (which reduces to the Maxwell theory in
three dimensions) and the Born-Infeld type gravities.

relation is independent of neutrino masses and whether neutrinos are Dirac- or
Majorana-type. Given the present constraints on the angles, delta_D is
constrained to be almost maximal, a result which can be explored in experiments
such as NOvA and T2K. The Majorana CP phases do not receive any constraint and
are thus model-dependent. Also a distribution of theta_x with a lower limit is
obtained without specifying delta_D.

strongly driven systems can be explained by magnetic flux pile-up at the
shoulder of the current sheet and subsequent fast reconnection via two-fluid,
collisionless mechanisms. In the strong drive regime with two-fluid effects, we
find that the ultimate reconnection time is insensitive to the nominal system
Alfven time.
