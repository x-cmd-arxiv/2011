dynamics of the universe by using Cosmography. We intend to explore it
systematically, to learn about its limitations and its real possibilities. Here
we are sticking to the series expansion approach on which Cosmography is based.
We apply it to different data sets: Supernovae Type Ia (SNeIa), Hubble
parameter extracted from differential galaxy ages, Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) and
the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. We go beyond past results in the
literature extending the series expansion up to the fourth order in the scale
factor, which implies the analysis of the deceleration, q_{0}, the jerk, j_{0}
and the snap, s_{0}. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (MCMC) to
analyze the data statistically. We also try to relate direct results from
Cosmography to dark energy (DE) dynamical models parameterized by the
Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, extracting clues about the matter
content and the dark energy parameters. The main results are: a) even if
relying on a mathematical approximate assumption such as the scale factor
series expansion in terms of time, cosmography can be extremely useful in
assessing dynamical properties of the Universe; b) the deceleration parameter
clearly confirms the present acceleration phase; c) the MCMC method can help
giving narrower constraints in parameter estimation, in particular for higher
order cosmographic parameters (the jerk and the snap), with respect to the
literature; d) both the estimation of the jerk and the DE parameters, reflect
the possibility of a deviation from the LCDM cosmological model.

$d(v,C_i)=\min\{d(v,x) |x\in C_i\}, 1\leq i\leq k$. If distinct vertices have
distinct color codes, then $c$ is called a locating coloring. The minimum
number of colors needed in a locating coloring of $G$ is the locating chromatic
number of $G$, denoted by $\Cchi_{{}_L}(G)$. In this paper, we study the
locating chromatic number of Kneser graphs. First, among some other results we

from orbiting point-like sources in the Kerr black hole equatorial plane to an

self-stabilization in a token ring consisting of N processes. The interaction
of tokens makes the dynamics of the protocol very difficult to analyze. In this
paper we study the expected time to stabilization in terms of the initial
configuration. It is straightforward that the algorithm achieves stabilization
almost surely from any initial configuration, and it is known that the
worst-case expected time to stabilization (with respect to the initial
configuration) is Theta(N^2). Our first contribution is to give an upper bound
of 0.64 N^2 on the expected stabilization time, improving on previous upper
bounds and reducing the gap with the best existing lower bound. We also
introduce an asynchronous version of the protocol, showing a similar O(N^2)
convergence bound in this case. Assuming that errors arise from the corruption
of some number k of bits, where k is fixed independently of the size of the
ring, we show that the expected time to stabilization is O(N). This reveals a
hitherto unknown and highly desirable property of Herman's algorithm: it
recovers quickly from bounded errors. We also show that if the initial
configuration arises by resetting each bit independently and uniformly at
random, then stabilization is significantly faster than in the worst case.

highly optimized tolerance (HOT) that involves strategic (game theoretic)
interactions between parties in a complex system. We illustrate our model in
the forest fire (percolation) framework. As the number of players increases,
our model retains features of HOT, such as robustness, high yield combined with
high density, and self-dissimilar landscapes, but also develops features of
self-organized criticality (SOC) when the number of players is large enough.
For example, the forest landscape becomes increasingly homogeneous and
protection from adverse events (lightning strikes) becomes less closely
correlated with the spatial distribution of these events. While HOT is a
special case of our model, the resemblance to SOC is only partial; for example,
the distribution of cascades, while becoming increasingly heavy-tailed as the
number of players increases, also deviates more significantly from a power law
in this regime. Surprisingly, the system retains considerable robustness even
as it becomes fractured, due in part to emergent cooperation between
neighboring players. At the same time, increasing homogeneity promotes
resilience against changes in the lightning distribution, giving rise to
intermediate regimes where the system is robust to a particular distribution of
adverse events, yet not very fragile to changes.

from the plane for both disk components, with similar slopes (-9.0 {\pm} 1.0

metallicity (about -0.2/dex), while the eccentricity does not change with
metallicity for the thin-disk subsample. The eccentricity is almost independent
of Galactocentric radius for the thin-disk population, while a marginal
gradient of the eccentricity with radius exists for the thick-disk population.
Both subsamples possess similar positive gradients of eccentricity with
distance from the Galactic plane. The shapes of the eccentricity distributions

formally, an instance $\I$ of \lbfl is specified by a set $\F$ of facilities
with facility-opening costs $\{f_i\}$, a set $\D$ of clients, and connection

collectively accrete large quantities of gas from the external medium are
derived using both simulations and analytic results. The consequences of large
mass accumulation in galaxy nuclei, dwarf galaxies and star clusters are
twofold. First, if the gas cools effectively star formation can be triggered,
generating new stellar members in the system. Second, if the collective
potential of the system is able to alter the ambient gas properties before the
gas is accreted onto the individual core members, the augmented mass supply
rates could significantly alter the state of the various accreting stellar
populations and result in an enhanced central black hole accretion luminosity.

events and variable stars, as a technique, influences a broad diversity of
pursuits in the entire astronomy endeavor. While, at a fundamental level, the
nature of the scientific pursuit remains unchanged, the advent of astronomy as
a data-driven discipline presents fundamental challenges to the way in which
the scientific process must now be conducted. Digital images (and data cubes)
are not only getting larger, there are more of them. On logistical grounds,
this taxes storage and transport systems. But it also implies that the intimate
connection that astronomers have always enjoyed with their data---from
collection to processing to analysis to inference---necessarily must evolve.
The pathway to scientific inference is now influenced (if not driven by) modern
automation processes, computing, data-mining and machine learning. The emerging
reliance on computation and machine learning is a general one, but the
time-domain aspect of the data and the objects of interest presents some unique

However, these images do not translate into microarcsecond absolute positions
due to the lack of absolute phase information when an external phase reference
is not used. Due to the short atmospheric coherence time at these wavelengths,
nodding between the source and phase reference is impractical. However, here we
suggest an alternative scheme which makes use of the fact that many of the VLBI
stations within the EHT are arrays in their own right. With this we show that
it should be possible to absolutely position the supermassive black holes at

precisions of roughly 1 microarcsecond. This is sufficient to detect the
perturbations to Sgr A*'s position resulting from interactions with the stars

severely constrain the astrophysically relevant parameter space for an orbiting
intermediate mass black hole, implicated in some mechanisms for producing the
young massive stars in the Galactic center. For M87, it allows the registering

formation, and outflows govern the the gaseous and metal content of galaxies.
In our simulations, galaxy metallicities are established by a balance between
inflows and outflows as governed by the mass outflow rate, implying that the
mass-metallicity relation reflects how the outflow rate varies with stellar
mass (M*). Gas content is set by a competition between inflow into and gas
consumption within the ISM, the latter being governed by the SF law, while the
former is impacted by both wind recycling and preventive feedback. Stochastic
variations in the inflow rate move galaxies off the equilibrium M*-Z and
Z*-fgas relations in a manner correlated with star formation rate, and the
scatter is set by the timescale to re-equilibrate. The evolution of both
relations from z=3-0 is slow, as individual galaxies tend to evolve mostly
along the relations. Gas fractions at a given M* slowly decrease with time
because the cosmic inflow rate diminishes faster than the consumption rate,
while metallicities slowly increase as infalling gas becomes more enriched.
Observations from z~3-0 are better matched by simulations employing
momentum-driven wind scalings rather than constant wind speeds, but all models
predict too low gas fractions at low masses and too high metallicities at high
M*. All our models reproduce observed second-parameter trends of the
mass-metallicity relation with star formation rate and environment, indicating
that these are a consequence of equilibrium and not feedback. Overall, the
analytical framework of our equilibrium scenario broadly captures the relevant

  in Appendix G",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Compressive Sensing (CS) framework aims to ease the burden on
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by reducing the sampling rate required to
acquire and stably recover sparse signals. Practical ADCs not only sample but
also quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is
an inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth.
In this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the
emphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In
particular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture
just their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal
reconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on
the best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d.
random Gaussian matrices describe measurement mappings achieving, with
overwhelming probability, nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider
reconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the
Binary $\epsilon$-Stable Embedding (B$\epsilon$SE) property, which
characterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the
same class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also
enable such a robust mapping. On the practical side, we introduce the Binary
Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm for signal reconstruction from
1-bit measurements that offers state-of-the-art performance.

state information (CSI) for the eavesdropper links. Robust transmit covariance
matrices are obtained based on worst-case secrecy rate maximization, under both
individual and global power constraints. For the case of an individual power
constraint, we show that the non-convex maximin optimization problem can be
transformed into a quasiconvex problem that can be efficiently solved with
existing methods. For a global power constraint, the joint optimization of the
transmit covariance matrices and power allocation between the source and the
helper is studied via geometric programming. We also study the robust wiretap
transmission problem for the case with a quality-of-service constraint at the
legitimate receiver. Numerical results show the advantage of the proposed
robust design. In particular, for the global power constraint scenario,
although cooperative jamming is not necessary for optimal transmission with
perfect eavesdropper's CSI, we show that robust jamming support can increase
the worst-case secrecy rate and lower the signal to interference-plus-noise
ratio at Eve in the presence of channel mismatches between the transmitters and

number of new tags (T) is a power law function of the active population (P), or
T P^gamma (gamma!=1). According to previous studies, it is the heterogeneity in
individual tagging behavior that gives rise to allometric growth. These studies
consider the power-law distribution model with an exponent beta, regarding
1/beta as an index for heterogeneity. However, they did not discuss whether
power-law is the only distribution that leads to allometric growth, or
equivalently, whether the positive correlation between heterogeneity and
allometric growth holds in systems of distributions other than power-law. In
this paper, the authors systematically examine the growth pattern of systems of
six different distributions, and find that both power-law distribution and
log-normal distribution lead to allometric growth. Furthermore, by introducing
Shannon entropy as an indicator for heterogeneity instead of 1/beta, the
authors confirm that the positive relationship between heterogeneity and
allometric growth exists in both cases of power-law and log-normal
distributions.

cosmology if we add radiation coupled to the Lee-Wick scalar field. This
coupling in principle would allow the energy to flow from radiation to matter,
thus providing a drain for the radiation energy. However, we find that it takes
an extremely unlikely fine tuning of the initial phases of the field

hierarchical scaling law are linked in many ways. The rank-size scaling and
hierarchical scaling seem to be two different sides of the same coin, but their
relationship has never been revealed by strict mathematical proof. In this
paper, the Zipf's distribution of cities is abstracted as a q-sequence. Based
on this sequence, a self-similar hierarchy consisting of many levels is defined
and the numbers of cities in different levels form a geometric sequence. An
exponential distribution of the average size of cities is derived from the
hierarchy. Thus we have two exponential functions, from which follows a
hierarchical scaling equation. The results can be statistically verified by
simple mathematical experiments and observational data of cities. A theoretical
foundation is then laid for the conversion from Zipf's law to the hierarchical
scaling law, and the latter can show more information about city development
than the former. Moreover, the self-similar hierarchy provides a new

27 kpc and a constant halo flattening (that is, ratio of minor axis to major

evidence for variations in flattening with radius, or for triaxiality of the

account for the top quark forward-backward asymmetry and the dijet anomaly at
CDF simultaneously with just three parameters: a coupling constant of order
one, and two scalar masses of 160 GeV and 220 GeV. However these fiducial
values of the parameters lead to the branching ratio of a almost pure penguin B
-> pi K decay about one hundred times larger than the experimental results.
Consider also the precision electroweak constraints, the scalar masses should
be at least around 500 GeV. Actually with the coupling constant larger than
one, it is impossible to explain either of the two CDF measurements
consistently in this model. But one may raise the charged scalar mass to, for
example, 250 GeV and reduce the coupling strength to 0.6 to meet the B physics
constraints. With this parameter set, the Wjj cross section is found to be in
the right range. But due to the scalar mass splitting, its correction to
T-parameter is about 3 sigma away from the precision electroweak constraints.
In addition, the top quark forward-backward asymmetry should be well below 0.1
with this small coupling constant.

where L_Edd is the Eddington luminosity and Lx(2-10 keV) is 2-10 keV X-ray

Blandford-Znajek model proposed by Meier, based on the global solution of the
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) surrounding a Kerr black hole (BH).
Our model calculations suggest that the maximal jet power is a function of mass
accretion rate and the black hole spin parameter j. The hard X-ray emission is
believed to be mainly from the ADAFs in FR Is, and the mass accretion rate is
therefore constrained with the X-ray emission in our ADAF model calculations.
We find that the dimensionless angular momentum of BH j>~0.9 is required in
order to reproduce the observed relation of P_jet/L_Edd-Lx(2-10 keV)/L_Edd for

disk galaxy with a typical flat rotation curve, our modeling results show that
the surface mass density monotonically decreases from the galactic center
toward periphery, according to Newtonian dynamics. In a large portion of the
galaxy, the surface mass density follows an approximately exponential law of
decay with respect to the galactic radial coordinate. Yet the radial scale
length for the surface mass density seems to be generally larger than that of
the measured brightness distribution, suggesting an increasing mass-to-light
ratio with the radial distance in a disk galaxy. In a nondimensionalized form,
our mathematical system contains a dimensionless parameter which we call the
""galactic rotation number"" that represents the gross ratio of centrifugal force
and gravitational force. The value of this galactic rotation number is
determined as part of the numerical solution. Through a systematic
computational analysis, we have illustrated that this galactic rotation number
remains within $\pm 10%$ of 1.70 for a wide variety of rotation curves. This
implies that the total mass in a disk galaxy is proportional to $V_0^2\,R_g$,
with $V_0$ denoting the characteristic rotation velocity and $R_g$ the radius
of the galactic disk. The predicted total galactic mass of the Milky Way is in
good agreement with the star-count data.

twist-deformed space-time. In particular, we consider two examples of such
noncommutative systems - the set of N particles moving in gravitational field
as well as the system of N interacting harmonic oscillators.

history, which is reviewed. Then some material is added, leading to the
inference that a soliton is a singularity in the geometry which represents a
bivalent source of gravitational and scalar mass.

  Under Strict Contractive Conditions In Fuzzy metric Space","14 pages",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  None has studied the well-posedness of common fixed points in fuzzy metric
space. In this paper, our target is to develop the well-posedness of common
fixed points in fuzzy metric space. Also using weakly compatibility, implicit
relation, property (E.A.) and strict contractive conditions, we have
established the unique common fixed point for three self mappings and also for
four self mappings in fuzzy metric space.
