magnetograms of the Sun. Traditionally, a spherical harmonics decomposition of
the magnetogram is used to construct the current and divergence free magnetic
field solution. This method works reasonably well when the order of spherical
harmonics is limited to be small relative to the resolution of the magnetogram,
although some artifacts, such as ringing, can arise around sharp features. When
the number of spherical harmonics is increased, however, using the raw
magnetogram data given on a grid that is uniform in the sine of the latitude
coordinate can result in inaccurate and unreliable results, especially in the
polar regions close to the Sun.
  We discuss here two approaches that can mitigate or completely avoid these
problems: i) Remeshing the magnetogram onto a grid with uniform resolution in
latitude, and limiting the highest order of the spherical harmonics to the
anti-alias limit; ii) Using an iterative finite difference algorithm to solve
for the potential field. The naive and the improved numerical solutions are
compared for actual magnetograms, and the differences are found to be rather
dramatic.
  We made our new Finite Difference Iterative Potential-field Solver (FDIPS) a
publically available code, so that other researchers can also use it as an
alternative to the spherical harmonics approach.

causal role that new neurons have on cognitive and affective behavioural tasks
is still far from clear. This is partly due to the difficulty of manipulating
levels of neurogenesis without inducing off-target effects, which might also
influence behaviour. In addition, the analytical methods typically used do not
directly test whether neurogenesis mediates the effect of an intervention on
behaviour. Previous studies may have incorrectly attributed changes in
behavioural performance to neurogenesis because the role of known (or unknown)
neurogenesis-independent mechanisms were not formally taken into consideration
during the analysis. Causal models can tease apart complex causal relationships
and were used to demonstrate that the effect of exercise on pattern separation
is via neurogenesis-independent mechanisms. Many studies in the neurogenesis
literature would benefit from the use of statistical methods that can separate
neurogenesis-dependent from neurogenesis-independent effects on behaviour.

temperature variance, often in concentric sets, in the cosmic microwave
background (CMB), discernable in WMAP data. Their reality can be interpreted as
evidence of supermassive black-hole encounters in a previous aeon, as predicted
by conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) [2]. Counter arguments [4-6] pointed out
that such circles arise, at similar frequency, also in simulated data using
WMAP's CMB power spectrum, plus random input. We responded [7] that if such
circles contribute to CMB, this influences the power spectrum, enhancing such
circles in simulations. We confirm this here, but show that if the theoretical
LCDM power spectrum is used instead, then the low-variance circles disappear.
This is evidence that the LCDM model gives an incomplete explanation of the
CMB, missing crucial information, which is provided by incorporating
low-variance circles of CCC. The excellent agreement between theoretical LCDM
and observed power spectrum, even for fairly large l-values, does not reveal
this discrepancy, of relevance only at larger l-values where agreement is weak.
We point out various non-random aspects of the circles, seen both in the true
data and in simulations with WMAP power spectrum, but not with the theoretical
LCDM spectrum. We also show the spatial distribution of concentric circle sets
to be very non-random in the true WMAP data (perhaps owing to large-scale mass
inhomogeneities distorting CCC's circle shapes), in complete contrast with
simulations with WMAP power spectrum, where such circle sets are much sparser
and closer to average temperature. These features are fully consistent with CCC
(and with an earlier analysis [8] that the random Gaussian component in the CMB
is only around 0.2 in the total CMB signal) but do not readily fit in with the
random initial fluctuations of standard inflation.

particles and clusters, leading to greater sizes and masses as compared to
neutral aggregates, for the same number of monomers in the aggregate. In
addition, aggregates coagulating in a Lorentzian plasma (containing a larger
fraction of high-energy plasma particles) are more massive and larger than
aggregates coagulating in a Maxwellian plasma, for the same plasma densities
and characteristic temperature. Comparisons of the grain structure, utilizing
the compactness factor, {\phi}{\sigma}, demonstrate that a Lorentzian plasma
environment results in fluffier aggregates, with small {\phi}{\sigma}, which
exhibit a narrow compactness factor distribution. Neutral aggregates are more
compact, with larger {\phi}{\sigma}, and exhibit a larger variation in

it can be non-zero in separable states, vanishing just for states diagonal in a

quantum correlations arise as a particular case of the present formalism. The

decouples vacuum energy from gravity, and thus can potentially address the
cosmological constant problem. The classical theory is distinguishable from
general relativity only in the presence of relativistic pressure (or
vorticity). Since the interior of neutron stars has high pressure and as their
mass and radius can be measured observationally, they are the perfect
laboratory for testing the validity of the aether theory. In this paper, we
solve the equations of stellar structure for the gravitational aether theory
and find the predicted mass-radius relation of non-rotating neutron stars using
two different realistic proposals for the equation of state of nuclear matter.
We find that the maximum neutron star mass predicted by the aether theory is
12% - 16% less than the maximum mass predicted by general relativity assuming
these two equations of state. We also show that the effect of aether is similar
to modifying the equation of state in general relativity. The effective
pressure of the neutron star given by the aether theory at a fiducial density
differs from the values given by the two nuclear equations of state to an
extent that can be constrained using future gravitational wave observations of
neutron stars in compact systems. This is a promising way to test the aether
theory if further progress is made in constraining the equation of state of
nuclear matter in densities above the nuclear saturation density.

observational data on prompt gamma-ray emission in GRBs. We find that, even
with highly optimistic assumptions, the magnetized jet model is radiatively too
inefficient to be consistent with observations. One way out is to assume that
much of the magnetic energy in the post-shock, or even pre-shock, jet material
is converted to particle thermal energy by some unspecified process, and then
radiated. This can increase the radiative efficiency sufficiently to fit
observations. Alternatively, jet acceleration may be driven by thermal pressure
rather than magnetic fields. In this case, which corresponds to the traditional
fireball model, sufficient prompt GRB emission could be produced either from
shocks at a large radius or from the jet photosphere closer to the center.

massive filaments, one of them in extinction (infrared dark cloud). We observe
very low line widths in NH_3 (FWHM <1km/s). These multi-wavelength,
high-resolution observations of high-mass pre-protocluster regions show that
the target regions are characterized by (i) turbulent Jeans fragmentation of
massive clumps into cores (from a Jeans analysis); (ii) cores and clumps that
are ""over-bound/subvirial"", i.e. turbulence is too weak to support them against

massive star, which can (for observed core sizes and velocities) be sustained
by accretion of envelope material onto the core, suggesting that (similar to
competitive accretion scenarios) the mass reservoir for star formation is not
necessarily limited to the natal core; (v) high deuteration ratios

find that the Virgo galaxy colours become redder with increasing concentration,
luminosity and surface brightness, while no dependence with cluster-centric
radius or local galaxy density is detected (over a range of ~2 Mpc and ~3-16
Mpc^-2, respectively). However, the colours of gas-rich Virgo galaxies do
correlate with neutral gas deficiency, such that these galaxies become redder
with higher deficiencies. Comparisons with stellar population models suggest
that these colour gradients arise principally from variations in stellar
metallicity within these galaxies, while age variations only make a significant
contribution to the colour gradients of Virgo irregulars. A detailed stellar

modest stellar insolation, indicating equilibrium temperatures $< 1000$ K, and
for which the heating mechanism that inflates hot Jupiters does not appear to
be significantly active. We use structural evolution models to infer the amount
of heavy elements within each of these planets. There is a correlation between
the stellar metallicity and the mass of heavy elements in its transiting
planet(s). It appears that all giant planets posses a minimum of $\sim$ 10-15
Earth masses of heavy elements, with planets around metal-rich stars having
larger heavy element masses. There is also an inverse relationship between the
mass of the planet and the metal enrichment ($Z_{\textrm pl} / Z_{\textrm
star}$), which appears to have little dependency on the metallicity of the
star. Saturn- and Jupiter-like enrichments above solar composition are a
hallmark of all the gas giants in the sample, even planets of several Jupiter
masses. These relationships provides an important constraint on planet
formation, and suggests large amounts of heavy elements within planetary H/He
envelopes. We suggest that the observed correlation can soon also be applied to
inflated planets, such that the interior heavy element abundance of these
planets could be estimated, yielding better constraints no their interior
energy sources. We point to future directions for planetary population
synthesis models and suggest future correlations. This appears to be the first
evidence that extrasolar giant planets, as a class, are enhanced in heavy
elements.

  Networks without Common Control Channel under Homogeneous Primary Traffic","to appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2011",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cognitive radio (CR) technology is regarded as a promising solution to the
spectrum scarcity problem. Due to the spectrum varying nature of CR networks,
unlicensed users are required to perform spectrum handoffs when licensed users
reuse the spectrum. In this paper, we study the performance of the spectrum
handoff process in a CR ad hoc network under homogeneous primary traffic. We
propose a novel three dimensional discrete-time Markov chain to characterize
the process of spectrum handoffs and analyze the performance of unlicensed
users. Since in real CR networks, a dedicated common control channel is not
practical, in our model, we implement a network coordination scheme where no
dedicated common control channel is needed. Moreover, in wireless
communications, collisions among simultaneous transmissions cannot be
immediately detected and the whole collided packets need to be retransmitted,
which greatly affects the network performance. With this observation, we also
consider the retransmissions of the collided packets in our proposed
discrete-time Markov chain. In addition, besides the random channel selection
scheme, we study the impact of different channel selection schemes on the
performance of the spectrum handoff process. Furthermore, we also consider the
spectrum sensing delay in our proposed Markov model and investigate its effect
on the network performance. We validate the numerical results obtained from our
proposed Markov model against simulation and investigate other parameters of
interest in the spectrum handoff scenario. Our proposed analytical model can be
applied to various practical network scenarios. It also provides new insights
on the process of spectrum handoffs. Currently, no existing analysis has

  July 2011",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cognitive radio (CR) technology is a promising solution to enhance the
spectrum utilization by enabling unlicensed users to exploit the spectrum in an
opportunistic manner. Since unlicensed users are temporary visitors to the
licensed spectrum, they are required to vacate the spectrum when a licensed
user reclaims it. Due to the randomness of the appearance of licensed users,
disruptions to both licensed and unlicensed communications are often difficult
to prevent. In this chapter, a proactive spectrum handoff framework for CR ad
hoc networks is proposed to address these concerns. In the proposed framework,
channel switching policies and a proactive spectrum handoff protocol are
proposed to let unlicensed users vacate a channel before a licensed user
utilizes it to avoid unwanted interference. Network coordination schemes for
unlicensed users are also incorporated into the spectrum handoff protocol
design to realize channel rendezvous. Moreover, a distributed channel selection
scheme to eliminate collisions among unlicensed users is proposed. In our
proposed framework, unlicensed users coordinate with each other without using a
common control channel. We compare our proposed proactive spectrum handoff
protocol with a reactive spectrum handoff protocol, under which unlicensed
users switch channels after collisions with licensed transmissions occur.
Simulation results show that our proactive spectrum handoff outperforms the
reactive spectrum handoff approach in terms of higher throughput and fewer
collisions to licensed users. In addition, we propose a novel three dimensional
discrete-time Markov chain to characterize the process of reactive spectrum
handoffs and analyze the performance of unlicensed users. We validate the
numerical results obtained from our proposed Markov model against simulation
and investigate other parameters of interest in the spectrum handoff scenario.

be carefully designed to minimize the interference and delay to the
\emph{primary} (licensed) users. One of the main challenges in dynamic spectrum
access is to determine when the \emph{secondary} (unlicensed) users can use the
spectrum. In particular, when the secondary user is using the spectrum, if the
primary user becomes active to use the spectrum, it is usually hard for the
secondary user to detect the primary user instantaneously, thus causing
unexpected interference and delay to primary users. The secondary user cannot
detect the presence of primary users instantaneously because the secondary user
is unable to detect the spectrum at the same time while it is transmitting. To
solve this problem, we propose the full duplex wireless communications scheme
for CRNs. In particular, we employ the Antennas Cancellation (AC), the RF
Interference Cancellation (RIC), and the Digital Interference Cancellation
(DIC) techniques for secondary users so that the secondary user can scan for
active primary users while it is transmitting. Once detecting the presence of
primary users, the secondary user will release the spectrum instantaneously to
avoid the interference and delay to primary users. We analyze the packet loss
rate of primary users in wireless full duplex CRNs, and compare them with the
packet loss rate of primary users in wireless half duplex CRNs. Our analyses
and simulations show that using our developped wireless full duplex CRNs, the
packet loss rate of primary users can be significantly decreased as compared
with that of primary users by using the half duplex CRNs.

at minimizing the BS usages and reducing the interfering range of the

multiple access over multiple mobile users, while the second one employs

$H,A,H^\pm$ are all relatively heavy. Furthermore, the ratio of Higgs vevs,
$\tan \beta$, is relatively unconstrained. In contrast to this, in the 4GMSSM,
heavy fourth generation fermion loops drive the masses of $h,H,H^\pm$ to large
values while the CP-odd boson, $A$, can remain relatively light and $\tan
\beta$ is restricted to the range $1/2 \lsim \tan \beta \lsim 2$ due to
perturbativity requirements on Yukawa couplings. We explore this scenario in

at both the Tevatron and LHC. We find that while $gg \to A$ may lead to a
potential signal in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel at the LHC, $A$ may first be
observed in the $\gamma \gamma$ channel due to a highly loop-enhanced cross
section that can be more than an order of magnitude greater than that of a SM
Higgs for $A$ masses of $\sim 115-120$ and $\tan\beta<1$. We find that the

biaxial tensile film strain of 0.16% is verified by XRD. Suitability for device
manufacturing is demonstrated through fabrication and characterization of
metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors that exhibit photoresponse beyond 1.55
{\mu}m. The substrate fabrication process is compatible with complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing and represents a potential route to
wafer-scale integration of silicon-compatible optoelectronics.

and important mechanism to disperse the circumstellar dust and gas from which
planets form. Here, we present a detailed study of the circumstellar disk
surrounding the nearby star TW Hya and provide observational constraints to its
photoevaporative wind. Our new high-resolution (R ~ 30,000) mid-infrared
spectroscopy in the [Ne II] 12.81 {\mu}m line confirms that this gas diagnostic
traces the unbound wind component within 10AU from the star. From the blueshift
and asymmetry in the line profile, we estimate that most (>80%) of the [Ne II]
emission arises from disk radii where the midplane is optically thick to the
redshifted outflowing gas, meaning beyond the 1 or 4AU dust rim inferred from
other observations. We re-analyze high-resolution (R ~ 48, 000) archival
optical spectra searching for additional transitions that may trace the
photoevaporative flow. Unlike the [Ne II] line, optical forbidden lines from
OI, SII, and MgI are centered at the stellar velocity and have symmetric
profiles. The only way these lines could trace the photoevaporative flow is if
they arise from a disk region physically distinct from that traced by the [Ne
II] line, specifically from within the optically thin dust gap. However, the
small (~10 km/s) FWHM of these lines suggest that most of the emitting gas
traced at optical wavelengths is bound to the system rather than unbound. We
discuss the implications of our results for a planet-induced versus a
photoevaporation-induced gap.

the six luminosity correlations ($\tlag-L$, $V-L$, $\epkk-L$, $\epkk-E_\gamma$,
$\trt-L$, $\epkk-E_{\gamma, \mathrm{iso}}$) from the light curves and spectra
of the latest 116 long GRBs, including the time lag ($\tlag$) between low and
high photon energy light curves, the variability ($V$) of the light curve, the
peak energy of the spectrum ($\epkk$), and the minimum rise time ($\trt$) of
the peaks. We find that the intrinsic scatter of the $V-L$ correlation is too
large and there seems no inherent correlation between the two parameters using
the latest GRB data. The other five correlations indeed exist when the sample
is enlarged. The $\epkk-E_\gamma$ correlation has a significantly lower
intrinsic scatter compared to the other correlations. We divide the full data
into four redshift bins when testing possible evolution of the correlations
with redshift. We find no statistically significant evidence for the redshift
evolution of the luminosity correlations. To avoid the circularity problem when
constraining the cosmological parameters, we simultaneously minimize $\chi^2$
with respect to both correlation parameters $a$, $b$ and the cosmological
parameters using the maximum likelihood method. For the flat $\Lambda$CDM, the
best fit is $\omm=0.31^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$. We also constrain the possible
evolution of the equation of state (EOS) of the dark energy using the GRBs
together with the Union2 compilation of SNe Ia and the $H(z)$ data. The result
is consistent with the cosmological constant at $2 \sigma$ confidence level and
mainly due to the GRB data, the dark energy EOS shows slight deviation from -1
at $z \geq0.5$ as was persistently presented with many previous data sets.

parallax-determined distances of optically observed pulsational variables to
larger volumes. Distance ladder work at mid-infrared wavebands, where dust
effects are negligible and metallicity correlations are minimized, have been
largely focused on few-epoch Cepheid studies. Here we present the first
determination of mid-infrared period-luminosity (PL) relations of RR Lyrae
stars from phase-resolved imaging using the preliminary data release of the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We present a novel statistical
framework to predict posterior distances of 76 well-observed RR Lyrae that uses
the optically constructed prior distance moduli while simultaneously imposing a
power-law PL relation to WISE-determined mean magnitudes. We find that the
absolute magnitude in the bluest WISE filter is M_W1 = (-0.421+-0.014) -
(1.681+-0.147)*log(P/0.50118 day), with no evidence for a correlation with
metallicity. Combining the results from the three bluest WISE filters, we find
that a typical star in our sample has a distance measurement uncertainty of
0.97% (statistical) plus 1.17% (systematic). We do not fundamentalize the
periods of RRc stars to improve their fit to the relations. Taking the
Hipparcos-derived mean V-band magnitudes, we use the distance posteriors to
determine a new optical metallicity-luminosity relation which we present in
Section 5. The results of this analysis will soon be tested by HST parallax
measurements and, eventually, with the Gaia astrometric mission.

dilution, on the physics of the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on

localized moments which interact via a random, unfrustrated network of
effective couplings, realizing a random-exchange Heisenberg model (REHM) in one
spatial dimension. This system exhibits a power-law diverging correlation
length as the temperature decreases. Contrary to previous claims, we observe
that the scaling exponent is non-universal, i.e., doping dependent. This
finding can be explained by the discrete nature of the values taken by the
effective exchange couplings in the doped ladder. Bond dilution on even-leg
ladders leads to a more complex evolution with doping of correlations, which
are weakly enhanced in 2-leg ladders, and are even suppressed for low dilution
in the case of 4-leg and 6-leg ladders. We clarify the different aspects of
correlation enhancement and suppression due to bond dilution by isolating the
contributions of rung-bond dilution and leg-bond dilution.

maximum likelihood and non-maximum likelihood. The maximum likelihood
estimators rely on the maximum likelihood principle to ensure the accuracy of
the estimates obtained by the estimators. Unfortunately, all of the maximum
likelihood estimators need to use an iterative procedure to search the solution
space for the maximum or to solve a high degree polynomial. An iterative
procedure can be computationally expensive and may even converge to a local
maximum. On the other hand, the non-maximum likelihood estimators pursue closed
form solutions by scarifying the accuracy of estimates. To overcome the
pitfalls, we, in this paper, propose a closed form and maximum likelihood
estimator to estimate the loss rate of a link in a network. The closed form
solution is built on the discovery of a connection between the number of probes
passing a link and the number of probes passing its parent. The proposed
estimator is applicable to both the tree topology and the general one.

With ORA, protocols tend to determine and use the optimal communication
structure at every time instant; whereas with LORA, a protocol tends to use a
chosen communication structure as long as it exists. In this paper, we study
the impact of the ORA and LORA strategies on minimum hop routes and minimum
connected dominating sets (MCDS) in MANETs. Our primary hypothesis is that the
LORA strategy could yield routes with a larger time-averaged hop count and MCDS
node size when compared to the minimum hop count of routes and the node size of
the MCDS determined using the ORA strategy. Our secondary hypothesis is that
the impact of ORA vs. LORA also depends on how long the communication structure
is being used. Our hypotheses are evaluated using extensive simulations under
diverse conditions of network density, node mobility and mobility models such
as the Random Waypoint model, City Section model and the Manhattan model. In
the case of minimum hop routes, which exist for relatively a much longer time
compared to the MCDS, the hop count of routes maintained according to LORA,
even though not dramatically high, is appreciably larger (6-12%) than those
maintained according to ORA; on the other hand, the number of nodes
constituting a MCDS maintained according to LORA is only at most 6% larger than
the node size of a MCDS maintained under the ORA strategy.

linear confining potential for the quark-antiquark interaction. We utilize T

explain the observed damping of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves in the

direction transverse to the direction of the magnetic field. Theoretical
studies of this damping mechanism were greatly inspired by the first
observations of post-flare standing kink modes in coronal loops using the
Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE). More recently, these studies
have been extended to explain the attenuation of propagating coronal kink waves
observed by the Coronal Multi-Channel Polarimeter (CoMP). In the present study,
for the first time we investigate the properties of propagating kink waves in

dependent on the longitudinal stratification and the amplitude is simply a

are privacy and autonomy from big brotherly service providers. The promise of
decentralization is complete freedom for end-users from any service providers
both in terms of keeping privacy about content and communication, and also from
any form of censorship. However decentralization introduces many challenges.
One of the principal problems is to guarantee availability of data even when
the data owner is not online, so that others can access the said data even when
a node is offline or down. In this paper, we argue that a pragmatic design
needs to explicitly allow for and leverage on system heterogeneity, and provide
incentives for the resource rich participants in the system to contribute such
resources. To that end we introduce SuperNova - a super-peer based DOSN
architecture. While proposing the SuperNova architecture, we envision a dynamic
system driven by incentives and reputation, however, investigation of such
incentives and reputation, and its effect on determining peer behaviors is a
subject for our future study. In this paper we instead investigate the efficacy
of a super-peer based system at any time point (a snap-shot of the envisioned
dynamic system), that is to say, we try to quantify the performance of
SuperNova system given any (fixed) mix of peer population and strategies.

with an elliptical FDD. Modeling results in an apparent angular FDD diameter of
W Hya of about (80 +/- 1.2) mas (7.8 AU) between 8 and 10 microns, which
corresponds to an about 1.9 times larger diameter than the photospheric one.
The diameter gradually increases up to (105 +/- 1.2) mas (10.3 AU) at 12
microns. In contrast, the FDD relative flux fraction decreases from (0.85 +/-
0.02) to (0.77 +/- 0.02), reflecting the increased flux contribution from a
fully resolved surrounding silicate dust shell. The asymmetric character of the
extended structure could be confirmed. An elliptical FDD yields a position

dependency is revealed with a diameter increase of (5.4 +/- 1.8) mas between

that it also underpins the dual particle and wave nature of quantum systems. We
begin by noting that a classical point particle breaks translational symmetry
whereas a wave with uniform amplitude does not. This provides a basis for
associating particle nature with asymmetry and wave nature with symmetry. We
derive expressions for the maximum amount of classical information we can have
about the symmetry and asymmetry of a quantum system with respect to an
arbitrary group. We find that the sum of the information about the symmetry
(wave nature) and the asymmetry (particle nature) is bounded by log(D) where D
is the dimension of the Hilbert space. The combination of multiple systems is
shown to exhibit greater symmetry and thus more wavelike character. In
particular, a class of entangled systems is shown to be capable of exhibiting

essentially an interference phenomenon involving wave-like symmetry with
respect to the group of Pauli operators.

superposition of meta-stable states in a tripod-structured atom using
frequency-chirped laser pulses. Negligible excitation of the atoms during the
creation of the superposition states is a priority in our consideration. The
underlying physics of the scheme is explained using the formalism of adiabatic
states. By numerically solving master equation for the density matrix operator,
we analyze the influence of the spontaneous decay and transverse relaxation on
the efficiency of the creation of superposition states. We show that the
proposed scheme is robust against small-to-medium variations of the parameters
of the laser pulses. We provide a detailed analysis of the effect of the
inhomogeneous (Doppler-) broadening on the efficiency of the coherence creation
and show that the proposed scheme may be equally efficient in both
homogeneously and Doppler-broadened media.

galaxies in the mass range $10^8-10^{10} M_{\odot}$ are modified by the
interaction of the dwarf in study with the neighboring structures, and by
changing baryon fraction in dwarfs. As already shown in Del Popolo (2009), the
slope of density profile of inner halos flattens with decreasing halo mass and
the profile is well approximated by a Burkert's profile. The analysis shows
that dwarfs who suffered a smaller tidal torquing (consequently having smaller
angular momentum) are characterized by steeper profiles with respect to dwarfs
subject to higher torque, and similarly dwarfs having a smaller baryons
fraction have also steeper profiles than those having a larger baryon fraction.
In the case tidal torquing is shut down and baryons are not present, the
density profile is very well approximated by an Einasto profile, similarly to
dwarfs obtained in dissipationless N-body simulations. We then apply the result
of the previous analysis to the dark matter halo rotation curves of three
different dwarfs, namely NGC 2976, known to have a flat inner core, NGC 5949
having a profile intermediate between a cored and a cuspy one, and NGC 5963
having a cuspy profile. After calculating baryon fraction, which is $\simeq
0.1$ for the three galaxies, we fitted the rotation curves changing the value
of angular momentum. NGC 2976, has an higher value of ordered angular momentum
($\lambda \simeq 0.04$) with respect to NGC 5949 ($\lambda \simeq 0.025$) and
in the case of NGC 5963 the very steep profile can be obtained with a low value
of $\lambda$ ($\lambda \simeq 0.02$) and also decreasing the value of the
random angular momentum. In the case of NGC 2976 tidal interaction with M81
could have also influenced the inner part of the density profile.

limit theorem. Hence, for any point of the Thoma simplex, the corresponding
measures on the levels of the Young graph have a property of gaussian
concentration. By using the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm and the theory
of Pitman operators, we relate these results to the properties of certain
random permutations obtained by riffle shuffles, and to the behaviour of random
walks conditioned to stay in a Weyl chamber.

grand canonical approach to derive an analytical expression for the equilibrium
distribution of strategies. We then study the properties of the solution as a
function of the mean number of players, and compare them with a large dataset

for small population size $N$, while for larger $N$ a qualitatively different
