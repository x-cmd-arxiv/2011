indices and comparison to spectral templates indicate classifications ranging
from T5.5 to T8.5:. The spectrum of the latest-type source, WISE J1812+2721, is
an excellent match to that of the T8.5 companion brown dwarf Wolf 940B.
WISE-based spectrophotometric distance estimates place these T dwarfs at 12-13
pc from the Sun, assuming they are single. Preliminary fits of the spectral
data to the atmosphere models of Saumon & Marley indicate effective
temperatures ranging from 600 K to 930 K, both cloudy and cloud-free
atmospheres, and a broad range of ages and masses. In particular, two sources
show evidence of both low surface gravity and cloudy atmospheres, tentatively
supporting a trend noted in other young brown dwarfs and exoplanets. In
contrast, the high proper motion T dwarf WISE J2018-7423 exhibits a suppressed
K-band peak and blue spectrophotometric J-K colors indicative of an old,
massive brown dwarf; however, it lacks the broadened Y-band peak seen in
metal-poor counterparts. These results illustrate the broad diversity of
low-temperature brown dwarfs that will be uncovered with WISE.

consequences for computability and computational complexity. The paper argues
that the introduction of the first Peano axiom in the traditional definition of
natural numbers is not essential. It claims that natural numbers remain usable
in traditional ways without assuming the existence of at least one natural
number. However, the uncertainty about the existence of natural numbers
translates into every computation and introduces intrinsic uncertainty that
cannot be avoided. The uncertainty in the output of a computation can be
reduced, though, at the expense of a longer runtime and thus higher complexity.
For the new representation of natural numbers, the paper claims that, with the
first Peano axiom, P is equal to NP, and that without the first Peano axiom, P
becomes a proper subset of NP.

bound consistency can be enforced in polynomial time; this applies to the

extracting the time-tag information from the FUV and NUV spectroscopic data.
Single-color light curves were thus produced in 60 s time bins. The Fourier
analysis of these data successfully recovers the main pulsation modes of the
three stars previously known to be variable from ground-based observations. We
also report the discovery of pulsations in another object, SDSS J1153+0056,

the first pulsating white dwarf to be discovered from space-based observations.
The relatively high amplitudes of the modes observed in the FUV -- 2 to 4 times
that observed in the optical -- as well as the high fraction of stars variable
in our sample suggest that most, if not all, Hot DQ white dwarfs might be
pulsating at some level when observed at high enough sensitivity. Our results

central charge $c=1$ is shown to have a phase transition at some value $n_c$ of
the R\'enyi parameter $n$ which depends on the Luttinger parameter (or
compactification radius R). Using a new replica-free formulation, the entropy
is expressed as a combination of single-sheet partition functions evaluated at
$n-$ dependent values of the stiffness. The transition occurs when a vertex
operator becomes relevant at the boundary. Our numerical results (exact
diagonalizations for the XXZ and $J_1-J_2$ models) are in agreement with the
analytical predictions: above $n_c=4/R^2$ the subleading and universal
contribution to the entropy is $\ln(L)(R^2-1)/(4n-4)$ for open chains, and
$\ln(R)/(1-n)$ for periodic ones (R=1 at the free fermion point). The replica
approach used in previous works fails to predict this transition and turns out
to be correct only for $n<n_c$. From the point of view of two-dimensional
Rokhsar-Kivelson states, the transition reveals a rich structure in the

accelerate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of transport equations. Ideally,
adjoint methods allow for zero-variance MC estimators provided that the
solution to an adjoint transport equation is known. Hybrid methods aim at (i)
approximately solving the adjoint transport equation with a deterministic
method; and (ii) use the solution to construct an unbiased MC sampling
algorithm with low variance. The problem with this approach is that both steps
can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we simplify steps (i) and (ii)
by calculating only parts of the adjoint solution. More specifically, in a
geometry with limited volume scattering and complicated reflection at the
boundary, we consider the situation where the adjoint solution ""neglects""
volume scattering, whereby significantly reducing the degrees of freedom in
steps (i) and (ii). A main application for such a geometry is in remote sensing
of the environment using physics-based signal models. Volume scattering is then
incorporated using an analog sampling algorithm (or more precisely a simple
modification of analog sampling called a heuristic sampling algorithm) in order
to obtain unbiased estimators. In geometries with weak volume scattering (with
a domain of interest of size comparable to the transport mean free path), we
demonstrate numerically significant variance reductions and speed-ups (figures
of merit).

significant deviation from planarity of the crystal, the electronic structure
of exfoliated suspended graphene is nearly that of ideal, undoped graphene; we
measure the Dirac point to be within 25 meV of $E_F$ . Further, we show that
suspended graphene behaves as a marginal Fermi-liquid, with a quasiparticle
lifetime which scales as $(E - E_F)^{-1}$; comparison with other graphene and

weakly with $J'/J$. At $J'_c \approx 1.45 J$ a direct first-order transition to
a quantum orthogonal-dimer singlet ground state without magnetic long-range

to the loss of any coherence in the initial state of the qubit and we show that
the exact dynamics of this process is strongly influenced by the effect of the
orthogonality catastrophe within the gas. We highlight the relationship between
the Loschmidt echo and the retarded Green's function - typically used to
formulate the dynamical theory of the catastrophe - and demonstrate that the

demonstrate how the expected broadening of the spectral function can be

  Priors",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CG cs.GR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given the ever increasing bandwidth of the visual information available to
many intelligent systems, it is becoming essential to endow them with a sense
of what is worthwhile their attention and what can be safely disregarded. This
article presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the
available computational resources to process the parts of the input that are
relevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the
hypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H),
representing how well each hypothesis ""explains"" the input. Given the large
bandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is
computationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large
number of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework
with two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute
lower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds
are much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by
increasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to
discard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of
shapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention
Mechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next,
with the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of
computation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses
are discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed
to find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the
problem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input. We instantiate the proposed
framework for the problem of simultaneously estimating the class, pose, and a
noiseless version of a 2D shape in a 2D image.

to develop a theoretical framework where observations can be investigated with
a wider range of possible interpretations. We look here into the growth of
large-scale structure in the models. The Szekeres models are exact solutions to
Einstein's equations that were originally derived with no symmetries. We use a
formulation of the models that is due to Goode and Wainwright, who considered
the models as exact perturbations of an FLRW background. Using the Raychaudhuri
equation, we write for the two classes of the models, exact growth equations in
terms of the under/overdensity and measurable cosmological parameters. The new
equations in the overdensity split into two informative parts. The first part,
while exact, is identical to the growth equation in the usual linearly
perturbed FLRW models, while the second part constitutes exact non-linear
perturbations. We integrate numerically the full exact growth rate equations
for the flat and curved cases. We find that for the matter-dominated era, the
Szekeres growth rate is up to a factor of three to five stronger than the usual
linearly perturbed FLRW cases, reflecting the effect of exact Szekeres
non-linear perturbations. The growth is also stronger than that of the
non-linear spherical collapse model, and the difference between the two
increases with time. This highlights the distinction when we use general
inhomogeneous models where shear and a tidal gravitational field are present
and contribute to the gravitational clustering. Additionally, it is worth
observing that the enhancement of the growth found in the Szekeres models
during the matter-dominated era could suggest a substitute to the argument that
dark matter is needed when using FLRW models to explain the enhanced growth and
resulting large-scale structures that we observe today (abridged)

8.4 deg in some directions. We find evidence for a ""break"" population beyond ~8
radial scalelengths having a very shallow radial density profile that could be
either a bound stellar halo or a population of extratidal stars. The
distribution of the intermediate stellar component (3<R<7.5 deg) contrasts with
that of the inner stellar component (R<3 deg), which is both more elliptical
(ellipticity~0.3) and offset from the center of the intermediate component by
0.59 deg, although both components share a similar radial exponential scale

star-forming galaxies, extending the results of the COMBO-17, DEEP2, and other
surveys to z=2.2. The mass density of quiescent galaxies with M > 3 10^11 solar
masses increases by a factor of ~10 from z=2 to the present day, whereas the
mass density in star-forming galaxies is flat or decreases over the same time
period. Modest mass growth by a factor of 2 of individual quiescent galaxies
can explain roughly half of the strong density evolution at M>10^11 solar
masses, due to the steepness of the exponential tail of the mass function. The
rest of the density evolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is likely due to
transformation (e.g. quenching) of the massive star-forming population, a
conclusion which is consistent with the density evolution we observe for the
star-forming galaxies themselves, which is flat or decreasing with cosmic time.
Modest mass growth does not explain the evolution of less massive quiescent
galaxies (~10^10.5 solar masses), which show a similarly steep increase in
their number densities. The less massive quiescent galaxies are therefore
continuously formed by transforming galaxies from the star-forming population

mass-observable relations (MORs) to investigate the growth of structure and the
properties of dark energy. However, the measured cluster shear signal varies at
fixed mass M_200m due to inherent ellipticity of background galaxies,
intervening structures along the line of sight, and variations in the cluster
structure due to scatter in concentrations, asphericity and substructure. We
use N-body simulated halos to derive and evaluate a weak lensing circular
aperture mass measurement M_ap that minimizes the mass estimate variance <(M_ap
- M_200m)^2> in the presence of all these forms of variability. Depending on
halo mass and observational conditions, the resulting mass estimator improves
on M_ap filters optimized for circular NFW-profile clusters in the presence of
uncorrelated large scale structure (LSS) about as much as the latter improve on
an estimator that only minimizes the influence of shape noise. Optimizing for
uncorrelated LSS while ignoring the variation of internal cluster structure
puts too much weight on the profile near the cores of halos, and under some
circumstances can even be worse than not accounting for LSS at all. We briefly
discuss the impact of variability in cluster structure and correlated
structures on the design and performance of weak lensing surveys intended to
calibrate cluster MORs.

six sources with only pairs of Eddington-limited bursts, the distribution of

(quasi) long-range interactions. This system possesses intrinsically a large
degree of frustration resulting in a ground-state phase diagram in the

The Rabi frequency, \Omega, on the other hand, creates quantum fluctuations

increasing \Omega, we find that generically a commensurate-incommensurate
transition to a floating Rydberg crystal occurs first, that supports gapless
phonon excitations. For even larger \Omega, dislocations within the floating
Rydberg crystal start to proliferate and a second,
Kosterlitz-Thouless-Nelson-Halperin-Young dislocation-mediated melting
transition finally destroys the crystalline arrangement of Rydberg excitations.
This latter melting transition is generic for one-dimensional Rydberg crystals
and persists even in the absence of an optical lattice. The floating phase and
the concomitant transitions can, in principle, be detected by Bragg scattering

apply an ensemble sampler respecting affine invariance to orbital parameter
extraction from radial velocity data. This new sampler has only one free

observations provides robust lower and upper limits with 3000 Msun < M < 3 x
10^5 Msun, at 90% confidence, placing HLX-1 firmly in the intermediate-mass

peak energy of the thermal component in the spectrum. This bound is consistent
with (but independent of) arguments based solely on the Eddington limit. Joint
spectral modelling of the XMM-Newton data with more luminous Swift and Chandra
observations increases the lower bound to 6000 Msun, but this tighter
constraint is not independent of the Eddington limit. The upper bound on M is
sensitive to the maximum allowed inclination i, and is reduced to M < 10^5 Msun

this prelude, a hypothetical form of repulsive bosonic dark matter is
discussed. The repulsion leads to nontrivial thermodynamic behavior, including
superfluidity, and would tend to suppress dynamical friction, greatly reducing
the drag exerted on rotating galactic bars. However, this form of dark matter

a second combination. It is possible to satisfy both constraints only for

operators obtains a new form of the Greens function: $$G(k,z)= \frac{\{1-
\frac{n}{2}\} + \Psi(k,z)}{z - \hat{E}_k - \Phi(k,z)}, $$ with {\em a pair of
self energies} $\Phi(z)$ and $\Psi(z)$. Its relationship with the Dyson form is
explored. A simple version of the two self energy model was shown recently to
successfully fit several data sets of photoemission line shapes in cuprates. We
provide details of the unusual spectral line shapes that arise in this model,
with the characteristic skewed shape depending upon a single parameter. The EDC
and MDC line shapes are shown to be skewed in opposite directions, and provide
a testable prediction of the theory.

modes are used, then DIE translates directly to bandwidth efficiency. In this
paper, the DIE vs. PIE tradeoffs for known modulations and receiver structures
are compared to the ultimate quantum limit, and analytic approximations are
found in the limit of high PIE. This analysis shows that known structures fall
short of the maximum attainable DIE by a factor that increases linearly with
PIE for high PIE.
  The capacity of the Dolinar receiver is derived for binary coherent-state

selects from a set of coherent states. For binary phase-shift keying (BPSK),
this is shown to be equivalent to the operation of the Dolinar receiver.
  The Dolinar receiver is extended to make adaptive measurements on a coded
sequence of coherent state symbols. Information from previous measurements is
used to adjust the a priori probabilities of the next symbols. The adaptive
Dolinar receiver does not improve the DIE vs. PIE tradeoff compared to

of a physical system whose governing laws are given approximately by a class
${\cal A}$ of so-called {\em prior vector fields}. Because the physical laws
are not known precisely, it might be that the measurements are not realised by
the integral curve of any prior field. We want to estimate the behaviour of the
physical system between times $t_0$ and $t_1$.
  An integral curve of an arbitrary vector field $X$ is said to be {\em
feasible} when it interpolates the measurements. When $X$ is critical for $L^2$
distance to ${\cal A}$, the feasible curve is called a {\em conditional
extremum}. When the distance to ${\cal A}$ is actually minimal, the conditional
extremum is a best estimate for the intermediate behaviour of the system.
  The present paper does some of basic groundwork for investigating
mathematical properties of conditional extrema, focusing on cases where ${\cal
A}$ comprises a single prior field $A$. When $A={\bf 0}$ a conditional extremal
is a geodesic arc, but this special case is not very representative. In
general, $A$ enters into the Euler-Lagrange equation for conditional extrema,
and more can be said when $A$ is conservative or has special symmetry.
  We characterise conservative priors on simply-connected Riemannian manifolds
in terms of their conditional extrema: when time is reversed, a constant is
added to the $L^2$ distance. For some symmetric priors on space forms we obtain
conditional extrema in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic function. For
left-invariant priors on bi-invariant Lie groups, conditional extrema are shown
to be right translations of pointwise-products of 1-parameter subgroups.

Dirac mass matrix of seesaw Lagrangian (with right-handed neutrinos being
mu-tau blind), which uniquely leads to inverted mass-ordering of light
neutrinos. We then predict a very different correlation between the two small
mu-tau breaking observables theta_{13}-0 and theta_{23}-45, which can saturate
the present experimental upper limit on theta_{13}. This will be tested against
our previous normal mass-ordering scheme by the on-going oscillation

of CP and mu-tau breaking in the neutrino seesaw, we establish a direct link
between the low energy CP violations and the cosmological CP violation for
baryon asymmetry. With these we further predict a lower bound on theta_{13},

the hidden symmetry Z_2^s (revealed in our previous work) which dictates the

significant shift of the radial velocity of the sub component gas with respect
to that of the main cluster was detected. All three XIS sensors show the shift
independently and consistently among the three. The difference is found to be

equations of state the dark matter distribution can be described as a single
anisotropic fluid, with vanishing tangential pressure, and non-zero radial
pressure. We investigate the properties of this model in the region of constant
velocity galactic rotation curves, where the dynamics of the test particles is
essentially determined by the dark matter only. By solving the general
relativistic equations of mass continuity and hydrostatic equilibrium we obtain
the geometric and physical parameters of the dark matter halos in the constant
velocity region in an exact analytical form. The general, radial coordinate
dependent, functional relationship between the energy density and the radial
pressure is also determined, and it differs from a simple barotropic equation
of state.

theoretical explanation, through analyzing the velocity matrix elements and the

the edge structure of nanoribbon, namely armchair or zigzag edges. The
selection rule of armchair nanoribbons is \Delta J=0, and the optical
transitions occur from the conduction to valence subbands of the same index.
Such a selection rule originates in the relationships between two sublattices
and between conduction and valence subbands. On the other hand, zigzag
nanoribbons exhibit the selection rule |\Delta J|=odd, which results from the
alternatively changing symmetry property as the subband index increases. An
efficiently theoretical prediction on transition energies is obtained with the

Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). With one processor core of Intel Core i7-2600
processor (8 MB cache and 3.40 GHz) based on Sandy Bridge micro-architecture,
we implemented a fourth-order Hermite scheme with individual timestep scheme
(Makino and Aarseth, 1992), and achieved the performance of 20 giga floating
point number operations per second (GFLOPS) for double-precision accuracy,
which is two times and five times higher than that of the previously developed
code implemented with the SSE instructions (Nitadori et al., 2006b), and that
of a code implemented without any explicit use of SIMD instructions with the
same processor core, respectively. We have parallelized the code by using
so-called NINJA scheme (Nitadori et al., 2006a), and achieved 90 GFLOPS for a
system containing more than N = 8192 particles with 8 MPI processes on four
cores. We expect to achieve about 10 tera FLOPS (TFLOPS) for a self-gravitating
collisional system with N 105 on massively parallel systems with at most 800
cores with Sandy Bridge micro-architecture. This performance will be comparable
to that of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) cluster systems, such as the one with
about 200 Tesla C1070 GPUs (Spurzem et al., 2010). This paper offers an
alternative to collisional N-body simulations with GRAPEs and GPUs.

dependence of spin polarization in high-mobility quantum wells is nonmonotonic:
The spin polarization rises with the magnetic field induction at small fields,

the Vela pulsar using data from the Virgo detector's second science run. These
upper limits have been obtained using three independent methods that assume the
gravitational wave emission follows the radio timing. Two of the methods
produce frequentist upper limits for an assumed known orientation of the star's
spin axis and value of the wave polarization angle of, respectively,
$1.9\ee{-24}$ and $2.2\ee{-24}$, with 95% confidence. The third method, under
the same hypothesis, produces a Bayesian upper limit of $2.1\ee{-24}$, with 95%
degree of belief. These limits are below the indirect {\it spin-down limit} of
$3.3\ee{-24}$ for the Vela pulsar, defined by the energy loss rate inferred
from observed decrease in Vela's spin frequency, and correspond to a limit on
the star ellipticity of $\sim 10^{-3}$. Slightly less stringent results, but
still well below the spin-down limit, are obtained assuming the star's spin
axis inclination and the wave polarization angles are unknown.

stripped spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster has led to a three dimensional
view of the galaxy orbits within the hot intracluster medium. The 3D velocities
and Mach numbers derived from simulations can be used to derive simple Mach
cone geometries for Virgo spiral galaxies. We search for indications of hot gas
within Mach cones in X-ray observations of selected Virgo Cluster spiral
galaxies (NGC 4569, NGC 4388, and NGC 4501). We find extraplanar diffuse X-ray
emission in all galaxies. Based on the 3D velocity vectors from dynamical
modelling a simple Mach cone is fitted to the triangular shape of NGC 4569's
diffuse X-ray emission. Assuming that all extraplanar diffuse X-ray emission
has to be located inside the Mach cone, we also fit Mach cones to NGC 4388's
and NGC 4501's extraplanar X-ray emission. For NGC 4569 it is hard to reconcile
the derived Mach cone opening angle with a Mach number based on the sound speed
alone. Instead, a Mach number involving the Alfv\'enic speed seems to be more
appropriate, yielding a magnetic field strength of $\sim 3$-6 $\mu$G for a
intracluster medium density of $n \sim 10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$. Whereas the
temperature of the hot component of NGC 4569's X-ray halo (0.5 keV) is at the
high end but typical for a galactic outflow, the temperature of the hot gas
tails of NGC 4388 and NGC 4501 are significantly hotter (0.7-0.9 keV). In NGC
4569 we find direct evidence for a Mach cone which is filled with hot gas from
a galactic superwind. We suggest that the high gas temperatures in the X-ray
tails of NGC 4388 and NGC 4501 are due to the mixing of the stripped ISM into
the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster.

charge and a unique form of a chiral neutral edge mode. Recent measurements in
the {\nu}=5/2 state detected quasiparticle charge e/4 and an upstream (opposite
to charge transport) chiral neutral mode; both agreeing with a non abelian

reconstruction as the source for the detected upstream neutral mode and a
different type of state. Here we present results of detailed measurements of

an upstream neutral mode - excluding the possibility of a non abelian
Read-Rezayi state and supporting a Laughlin-like state. Such exclusion holds
for the hole-conjugate {\nu}=7/3 state as well, in which no upstream neutral
mode was detected. This also proves that edge reconstruction was not present in

supporting further the non abelian anti Pfaffian state.

star characteristics such as energy-loss rate, magnetic field strength and
evolutionary timescales, as well as facilitating multi-wavelength followup by
providing accurate astrometry. All of this enables us to consider the question
of whether or not RRATs are in any way special, i.e. a distinct and separate
population of neutron stars, as has been previously suggested. We see no reason
to consider 'RRAT' as anything other than a detection label, the subject of a
selection effect in the parameter space searched. However, single-pulse
searches can be utilised to great effect to identify pulsars difficult, or
impossible, to find by other means, in particular those with long-periods (half
of the PMPS RRATs have periods greater than 4 seconds), high-magnetic field
strengths ($B\gtrsim 10^{13}$ G) and pulsars approaching the 'death valley'.
The detailed nulling properties of such pulsars are unknown but the mounting

for two-dimensional turbulent geophysical flows. This closure modeling approach
utilizes approximate deconvolution, which is based solely on mathematical
approximations and does not employ additional phenomenological arguments to the
model. The new approximate deconvolution model is tested in the numerical
simulation of the wind-driven circulation in a shallow ocean basin, a standard
prototype of more realistic ocean dynamics. The model employs the barotropic
vorticity equation driven by a symmetric double-gyre wind forcing, which yields
a four-gyre circulation in the time mean. The approximate deconvolution model
yields the correct four-gyre circulation structure predicted by a direct
numerical simulation, on a coarser mesh but at a fraction of the computational
cost. This first step in the numerical assessment of the new model shows that
approximate deconvolution could represent a viable tool for under-resolved
computations in the large eddy simulation of more realistic turbulent

It follows from a characteristic of the SM that the couplings to Higgs are

completely degenerate with LCDM, but it is easily distinguishable in the HS

puzzle. A viable option is entropy production through the decays of heavy
Majorana neutrinos whose lifetimes determine the initial temperature. We show
that baryogenesis and the production of dark matter are natural by-products of
this mechanism. As is well known, the cosmological baryon asymmetry can be
accounted for by leptogenesis for characteristic neutrino mass parameters. We
find that thermal gravitino production then automatically yields the observed
amount of dark matter, for the gravitino as the lightest superparticle and
typical gluino masses. As an example, we consider the production of heavy
Majorana neutrinos in the course of tachyonic preheating associated with
spontaneous B-L breaking. A quantitative analysis leads to contraints on the
superparticle masses in terms of neutrino masses: For a light neutrino mass of
10^{-5} eV the gravitino mass can be as small as 200 MeV, whereas a lower
neutrino mass bound of 0.01 eV implies a lower bound of 9 GeV on the gravitino
mass. The measurement of a light neutrino mass of 0.1 eV would rule out heavy
neutrino decays as the origin of entropy, visible and dark matter.

access location-based services through a moving k nearest neighbor (MkNN)

a region instead of the exact position to a location-based service provider
(LSP) cannot ensure privacy of the user for an MkNN query: continuous

identify the problem of trajectory privacy that arises from the overlap of
consecutive regions while requesting an MkNN query and provide the first
solution to this problem. Our approach allows a user to specify the confidence
level that represents a bound of how much more the user may need to travel than
the actual kth nearest data object. By hiding a user's required confidence
level and the required number of nearest data objects from an LSP, we develop a
technique to prevent the LSP from tracking the user's trajectory for MkNN

objects for a region with a user's specified confidence level, which is an
essential component to evaluate an MkNN query in a privacy preserving manner;
this algorithm is at least two times faster than the state-of-the-art

implemented in a well-established plane-wave-basis-set scheme combined with
norm-conserving pseudopotentials, thus enabling us to assess applicability of
each functional on equal footing to the properties of the materials. The
materials we have examined in this paper range from covalent to ionic materials
as well as a rare-gas solid whose energy gaps determined by experiments are in
the range of 0.6 eV - 14.2 eV: i.e., Ge, Si, BaTiO$_3$, $\beta$-GaN, diamond,
MgO, NaCl, LiCl, Kr, and LiF. We find that the calculated bulk moduli by the
hybrid functionals show better agreement with the experiments than the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) provides, whereas the calculated
lattice constants by the hybrid functionals and GGA show comparable accuracy.
The calculated energy band gaps and the valence-band widths for the ten
prototype materials show substantial improvement using the hybrid functional
compared with GGA. In particular, it is found that the band gaps of the ionic
materials as well as the rare-gas solid are well reproduced by the LC-hybrid
functional, whereas those of covalent materials are well described by the HSE

geometry decay to zero at a rate $t^{-2\lambda}$, where $\lambda=1, 2,...$ is

For the first set, we show that the wave decays as $t^{-2\lambda}$. For the
second set, in general, the solutions tend to some explicit profile at the rate
$t^{-2\lambda}$. The decay rate of solutions of Dirac equations is achieved by
showing that the coefficient of the explicit profile is exactly zero. The key
ingredients in the proof of the decay rate of solutions for the first set of
wave equations are an energy estimate used to show the absence of bound states
and zero energy resonance and the analysis of the spectral representation of
the solutions. The proof of asymptotic behavior for the solutions of the second
set of wave equations relies on careful analysis of the Green's functions for
time independent Schr\""odinger equations associated with these wave equations.

the simple additive rules that correspond to one-step aggregation process. The
two idealized cases were analytically investigated and simulated by Monte Carlo

Several aspects of aggregation kinetics (change of scaling, change of size
distribution type, and appearance of scale-free size distribution) driven by
""zero cluster size"" boundary condition were determined by analysis of evolving
cumulative distribution functions. The ""pile-up"" case with a \textit{minimum}
active surface (singularity) could imitate piling up aggregations of
dislocations, and the case with a \textit{maximum} active surface could imitate
arrangements of dislocations in walls. The change of scaling law (for pile-ups

analytically shown and confirmed by scaling, fitting, moment, and bootstrapping
analyses of simulated probability density and cumulative distribution
functions. The initial ""singular"" \textit{symmetric} distribution of pile-ups
evolves by the ""infinite"" diffusive scaling law and later it is replaced by the
other ""semi-infinite"" diffusive scaling law with \textit{asymmetric}

controller configurations characterizing an ensemble of arbitrary irregular
filter circuits. Our analysis illustrates that the parametric intrinsic
geometric description exhibits a set of exact pair correction functions and
global correlation volume with and without the variation of the mismatch
factor. The present consideration shows that the canonical fluctuations can
precisely be depicted without any approximation. The intrinsic geometric notion
offers a clear picture of the fluctuating controllers, which as the limit of
the ensemble averaging reduce to the specified controller. For the constant
mismatch factor controllers, the Gaussian fluctuations over equilibrium basis
accomplish a well-defined, non-degenerate, flat regular intrinsic Riemannian
surface. An explicit computation further demonstrates that the underlying power
correlations involve ordinary summations, even if we consider the variable
mismatch factor controllers. Our intrinsic geometric framework describes a

increase in the X-ray flux, so that the flare was one of the ""orphan""-type TeV
flares observed in BL Lacs. The flare lasted about 1 month at energies above 10
GeV. The flaring source spectrum in the 10-200 GeV range was very hard, with a
photon index 1.1+/-0.2, harder than that observed in any other blazar in the
gamma-ray band. No simultaneous flaring activity was detected below 10 GeV.
Different variability properties of the emission below and above 10 GeV
indicate the existence of two separate components in the spectrum. We
investigate possible explanations of the very hard flaring component. We
consider, among others, the possibility that the flare is produced by an
electromagnetic cascade initiated by very-high-energy gamma-rays in the
intergalactic medium. Within such an interpretation, peculiar spectral and
temporal characteristics of the flare could be explained if the magnetic field
in the intergalactic medium is of the order of 1e-17 - 1e-16 G.

on systems to investigate, in a uniform way, under which conditions calculi
that are sound and complete with respect to behavioral equivalence can be
extended to a coarser coalgebraic language equivalence, which arises from a
generalised powerset construction that determinises coalgebras. We show that
soundness and completeness are established by proving that expressions modulo
axioms of a calculus form the rational fixpoint of the given type functor. Our
main result is that the rational fixpoint of the functor $FT$, where $T$ is a
monad describing the branching of the systems (e.g. non-determinism, weights,
probability etc.), has as a quotient the rational fixpoint of the
""determinised"" type functor $\bar F$, a lifting of $F$ to the category of
$T$-algebras. We apply our framework to the concrete example of weighted
automata, for which we present a new sound and complete calculus for weighted
language equivalence. As a special case, we obtain non-deterministic automata,
where we recover Rabinovich's sound and complete calculus for language
equivalence.

human brain. However, fMRI data present some complications for statistical
analysis and modeling. One recently developed approach to these data focuses on
estimation of computational encoding models that describe how stimuli are
transformed into brain activity measured in individual voxels. Here we aim at
building encoding models for fMRI signals recorded in the primary visual cortex
of the human brain. We use residual analyses to reveal systematic nonlinearity
across voxels not taken into account by previous models. We then show how a
sparse nonparametric method [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 71 (2009b) 1009-1030]
can be used together with correlation screening to estimate nonlinear encoding
models effectively. Our approach produces encoding models that predict about
25% more accurately than models estimated using other methods [Nature 452
(2008a) 352--355]. The estimated nonlinearity impacts the inferred properties
of individual voxels, and it has a plausible biological interpretation. One
benefit of quantitative encoding models is that estimated models can be used to
decode brain activity, in order to identify which specific image was seen by an
observer. Encoding models estimated by our approach also improve such image
identification by about 12% when the correct image is one of 11,500 possible
images.

show that under reasonable assumptions on the intervention experiments,

observational Markov equivalence and hence improves the identifiability of

equivalent under interventions and show that each interventional Markov
equivalence class can, analogously to the observational case, be uniquely
represented by a chain graph called interventional essential graph (also known
as CPDAG in the observational case). These are key insights for deriving a

number of tile types needed to assemble $n \times n$ squares to
$\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ at temperature 1 for the most simple model which meets
a lower bound from Kolmogorov complexity, and $O(\log\log n)$ in a model in
which tile aggregates must move together through obstacle free paths within the
