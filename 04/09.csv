have gapless boundary excitations. They are characterized by topological
invariants, which can be written in many different ways, including in terms of
Green's functions. Here we show that the existence of the edge states directly
follows from the existence of the topological invariant written in terms of the
Green's functions, for all ten classes of topological insulators in all spatial
dimensions. We also show that the resulting edge states are characterized by
their own topological invariant, whose value is equal to the topological
invariant of the bulk insulator. This can be used to test whether a given model
Hamiltonian can describe an edge of a topological insulator. Finally, we
observe that the results discussed here apply equally well to interacting
topological insulators, with certain modifications.

also known as folksonomies. This problem requires a significant departure from
existing, socially agnostic techniques. In a network-aware context, one can
(and should) exploit the social links, which can indicate how users relate to
the seeker and how much weight their tagging actions should have in the result
build-up. We propose an algorithm that has the potential to scale to current
applications. While the problem has already been considered in previous
literature, this was done either under strong simplifying assumptions or under
choices that cannot scale to even moderate-size real world applications. We
first consider a key aspect of the problem, which is accessing the closest or
most relevant users for a given seeker. We describe how this can be done on the
fly (without any pre-computations) for several possible choices - arguably the
most natural ones - of proximity computation in a user network. Based on this,
our top-k algorithm is sound and complete, while addressing the scalability
issues of the existing ones. Importantly, our technique is instance optimal in
the case when the search relies exclusively on the social weight of tagging
actions. To further reduce response times, we then consider directions for
efficiency by approximation. Extensive experiments on real world data show that
our techniques can drastically improve the response time, without sacrificing
precision.

transport and of mean-field electrodynamics are considered with particular
emphasis on aspects of compressible fluids. It is demonstrated that the total
mean-field diffusivity for passive scalar transport in a compressible flow may
well be smaller than the molecular diffusivity. This is in full analogy to an
old finding regarding the magnetic mean-field diffusivity in an electrically
conducting turbulently moving compressible fluid. These phenomena occur if the
irrotational part of the motion dominates the vortical part, the P\`eclet or
magnetic Reynolds number is not too large, and, in addition, the variation of
the flow pattern is slow. For both the passive scalar and the magnetic cases
several further analytical results on mean-field diffusivities and related
quantities found within the second-order correlation approximation are
presented, as well as numerical results obtained by the test-field method,
which applies independently of this approximation. Particular attention is paid
to non-local and non-instantaneous connections between the turbulence-caused
terms and the mean fields. Two examples of irrotational flows, in which
interesting phenomena in the above sense occur, are investigated in detail. In
particular, it is demonstrated that the decay of a mean scalar in a
compressible fluid under the influence of these flows can be much slower than
without any flow, and can be strongly influenced by the so-called memory
effect, that is, the fact that the relevant mean-field coefficients depend on
the decay rates themselves.

the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. The reactive part of this equation
describes the response of the magnetization in terms of effective fields,
whereas the dissipative part is parameterized by the Gilbert damping tensor. We
formulate a scattering theory for the magnetization dynamics and map this
description on the linearized LLG equation by attaching electric contacts to
the ferromagnet. The reactive part can then be expressed in terms of the static
scattering matrix. The dissipative contribution to the low-frequency
magnetization dynamics can be described as an adiabatic energy pumping process
to the electronic subsystem by the time-dependent magnetization. The Gilbert
damping tensor depends on the time derivative of the scattering matrix as a
function of the magnetization direction. By the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, the fluctuations of the effective fields can also be formulated in
terms of the quasistatic scattering matrix. The theory is formulated for
general magnetization textures and worked out for monodomain precessions and
domain wall motions. We prove that the Gilbert damping from scattering theory
is identical to the result obtained by the Kubo formalism.

focused on the cosmic evolution of the baryon content in galaxies and its
division into various components (stars, cold gas, and hot gas). Both the SAMs
and simulations are compared with observational relations between halo mass and
stellar mass, and between stellar mass and star formation rate, at low and high
redshift. The simulations turn out to have much higher star formation
efficiencies (by about a factor of ten) than the SAMs. Therefore the cold gas
is consumed much more rapidly in the simulations and stars form much earlier.
Also, simulations show a transition between stellar mass growth that is
dominated by in situ formation of stars to growth that is predominantly through
accretion of stars formed in external galaxies. In SAMs, stellar growth is
always dominated by in situ star formation. In addition, SAMs overpredict the
overall gas accretion rates relative to the simulations, and overestimate the
fraction of ""hot"" relative to ""cold"" accretion. We discuss the reasons for
these discrepancies, and identify several physical processes that are missing
in our SAM. We also highlight physical processes that are neglected in the
simulations studied here, but which appear to be crucial in order to understand
the properties of real galaxies.

electromagnetism may give rise to cosmological birefringence (CB), a
frequency-independent rotation of the linear polarization of photons as they
propagate over cosmological distances. Inhomogeneities in the CB-inducing field
may yield a rotation angle that varies across the sky. Here we note that such a
spatially-varying birefringence may be correlated with the cosmic microwave

cross-correlation exists and other scenarios where the scalar field is simply a
massless spectator field, in which case the cross-correlation does not exist.

the mass-to-galaxy-number ratio within galaxy clusters, M/N, analogous to
cluster M/L ratios. Our w_p measurements are obtained from DR7 while the sample
of clusters is the maxBCG sample, with cluster masses derived from weak
gravitational lensing. We construct non-linear galaxy bias models using the
Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) to fit both w_p and M/N for different
cosmological parameters. HOD models that match the same two-point clustering
predict different numbers of galaxies in massive halos when Omega_m or sigma_8
is varied, thereby breaking the degeneracy between cosmology and bias. We
demonstrate that this technique yields constraints that are consistent and
competitive with current results from cluster abundance studies, even though
this technique does not use abundance information. Using w_p and M/N alone, we
find Omega_m^0.5*sigma_8=0.465+/-0.026, with individual constraints of
Omega_m=0.29+/-0.03 and sigma_8=0.85+/-0.06. Combined with current CMB data,
these constraints are Omega_m=0.290+/-0.016 and sigma_8=0.826+/-0.020. All
errors are 1-sigma. The systematic uncertainties that the M/N technique are
most sensitive to are the amplitude of the bias function of dark matter halos
and the possibility of redshift evolution between the SDSS Main sample and the
maxBCG sample. Our derived constraints are insensitive to the current level of
uncertainties in the halo mass function and in the mass-richness relation of
clusters and its scatter, making the M/N technique complementary to cluster

mass-loss prescription and various amounts of convective core overshooting. The
contribution of mass loss towards the mass discrepancy is determined using
these models, Results. Pulsation-driven mass loss is found to trap Cepheid
evolution on the instability strip, allowing them to lose about 5 - 10% of

composition factors and multiplicities of Kac modules for $\fg$ were given by
the second author in 1996, and by J. Brundan in 2003.
  We give a combinatorial proof of the equivalence between the two algorithms.
The proof uses weight and cap diagrams introduced by Brundan and C. Stroppel,
and cancelations between paths in a graph $\mathcal{G}$ defined using these
diagrams. Each vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds to a highest weight of a
finite dimensional simple module, and each edge is weighted by a nonnegative
integer. If $\mathcal{E}$ is the subgraph of $\mathcal{G}$ obtained by deleting
all edges of positive weight, then $\mathcal{E}$ is the graph that describes
non-split extensions between simple highest weight modules.
  We also give a procedure for finding the composition factors of any Kac
module, without cancelation. This procedure leads to a second proof of the main
result.

field including the Corona Australis (CrA) star-forming region. At a distance
of 130 pc, CrA is one of the closest regions known to be actively forming
stars, particularly within its embedded association, the Coronet. Using the
Spitzer data, we identify 51 young stellar objects (YSOs) in CrA which include
sources in the well-studied Coronet cluster as well as distributed throughout
the molecular cloud. Twelve of the YSOs discussed are new candidates, one of
which is located in the Coronet. Known YSOs retrieved from the literature are
also added to the list, and a total of 116 candidate YSOs in CrA are compiled.
Based on these YSO candidates, the star formation rate is computed to be 12 M_o
Myr^-1, similar to that of the Lupus clouds. A clustering analysis was also
performed, finding that the main cluster core, consisting of 68 members, is
elongated (having an aspect ratio of 2.36), with a circular radius of 0.59 pc
and mean surface density of 150 pc^-2.
  In addition, we analyze outflows and jets in CrA by means of new CO and H_2
data. We present 1.3 mm interferometric continuum observations made with the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) covering R CrA, IRS 5, IRS 7, and IRAS 18595-3712

study their proper motions, and identify exciting sources. The Spitzer and

CO (2-1) outflow detected in the SMA observations. There is also clear evidence
for a parsec-scale precessing outflow, E-W oriented, and originating in the SMA
2 region, likely driven by SMA 2 or IRS 7A.

Beams, vol. 16, Issue 7 (2013)",,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electron cooling is a well-established method to improve the phase space
quality of ion beams in storage rings. In the common rest frame of the ion and
the electron beam the ion is subjected to a drag force and it experiences a
loss or a gain of energy which eventually reduces the energy spread of the ion
beam. A calculation of this process is complicated as the electron velocity
distribution is anisotropic and the cooling process takes place in a magnetic
field which guides the electrons. In this paper the cooling force is calculated
in a model of binary collisions (BC) between ions and magnetized electrons, in
which the Coulomb interaction is treated up to second-order as a perturbation
to the helical motion of the electrons. The calculations are done with the help
of an improved BC theory which is uniformly valid for any strength of the
magnetic field and where the second-order two-body forces are treated in the
interaction in Fourier space without specifying the interaction potential. The
cooling force is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential
which is both of finite range and less singular than the Coulomb interaction at
the origin. Closed expressions are derived for monochromatic electron beams,
which are folded with the velocity distributions of the electrons and ions. The
resulting cooling force is evaluated for anisotropic Maxwell velocity
distributions of the electrons and ions.

Refinement (AMR) schemes based on a graded-octree data structure. The Poisson
equation is solved on a level-by-level basis, using a ""one-way interface""
scheme in which boundary conditions are interpolated from the previous coarser
level solution. Such a scheme is particularly well suited for self-gravitating
astrophysical flows requiring an adaptive time stepping strategy. By
constructing a multigrid hierarchy covering the active cells of each AMR level,
we have designed a memory-efficient algorithm that can benefit fully from the
multigrid acceleration. We present a simple method for capturing the boundary
conditions across the multigrid hierarchy, based on a second-order accurate
reconstruction of the boundaries of the multigrid levels. In case of very
complex boundaries, small scale features become smaller than the discretization
cell size of coarse multigrid levels and convergence problems arise. We propose
a simple solution to address these issues. Using our scheme, the convergence
rate usually depends on the grid size for complex grids, but good linear
convergence is maintained. The proposed method was successfully implemented on
distributed memory architectures in the RAMSES code, for which we present and

extends the traditional class of infinite-duration continuous-wave signals by a
finite start-time and duration. We derive a multi-detector Bayes factor for

simplifies the detection statistic and allows for an efficient implementation.

to directed searches for known pulsars, and a cheaper semi-coherent variant,
suitable for wide parameter-space searches for transients from unknown neutron

tracks in the temperature versus age plane is studied on the variations of the
gaplessness parameter (the ratio of the pairing gap for red-green quarks to the
electron chemical potential) and the magnitude of blue quark gap. The pairing
in the red-green channel is modeled assuming an inhomogeneous superconducting
phase to avoid tachionic instabilities and anomalies in the specific heat; the
blue colored condensate is modeled as a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type
color superconductor. We find that massive stars containing quark matter cool
faster in the neutrino-cooling era if one of the colors (blue) is unpaired

superconducting state. The cooling curves show significant variations along the
sequence, as the mass (or the central density) of the models is varied. This
feature provides a handle for fine-tuning the models to fit the data on the

  of extended ADC emission","Astronomy & Astrophysics in press, 15 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201015931",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report results of one-day simultaneous multiwavelength observations of
Cygnus X-2 using XMM, Chandra, the European VLBI Network and the XMM Optical
Monitor. During the observations, the source did not exhibit Z-track movement,
but remained in the vicinity of the soft apex. It was in a radio
quiescent/quiet state of < 150 microJy. Strong dip events were seen as 25%
reductions in X-ray intensity. The use of broadband CCD spectra in combination
with narrow-band grating spectra has now demonstrated for the first time that
these dipping events in Cygnus X-2 are caused by absorption in cool material in
quite a unique way. In the band 0.2 - 10 keV, dipping appears to be due to
progressive covering of the Comptonized emission of an extended accretion disk
corona, the covering factor rising to 40% in deep dipping with an associated
column density of 3.10^{23} atom cm^{-2}. Remarkably, the blackbody emission of
the neutron star is not affected by these dips, in strong contrast with
observations of typical low mass X-ray binary dipping sources. The Chandra and
XMM gratings directly measure the optical depths in absorption edges such as Ne
K, Fe L, and O K and a comparison of the optical depths in the edges of non-dip
and dip data reveals no increase of optical depth during dipping even though
the continuum emission sharply decreases. Based on these findings, at orbital
phase 0.35, we propose that dipping in this observation is caused by absorption
in the outer disk by structures located opposite to the impact bulge of the
accretion stream. With an inclination angle > 60 deg, these structures can
still cover large parts of the extended ADC, without absorbing emission from
the central neutral star.

able to probe the phase-space behavior in time-dependent Hartree-Fock during a
heavy-ion collision. We compare the Wigner distribution function with the
smoothed Husimi distribution function. Observables are defined to give a
quantitative measure for local and global equilibration. We present different
reaction scenarios by analyzing central and non-central $^{16}O+$$^{16}O$ and
$^{96}Zr+$$^{132}Zn$ collisions. It is shown that the initial phase-space
volumes of the fragments barely merge. The mean values of the observables are
conserved in fusion reactions and indicate a ""memory effect"" in time-dependent
Hartree-Fock. We observe strong dissipation but no evidence for complete
equilibration.

represented by the fundamental solution of a N-dimensional generalized
Schrodinger equation for free matter. Specifically this solution can be applied
to describe the 3D space evolution of the Universe in the forward direction in
time. The model which is based on the presented solution is close to the well
known Inflation theory, but is nonsingular, does not violate the conservation
laws and is finite throughout the whole space at any moment of time. According
to this model, the evolution progresses non-uniformly with a positive
acceleration. Moreover, the model correctly approaches Hubble's law in the
long-time limit. It is also shown that any source functions which describe
substance and its physical fields set space topology of the Universe, but do
not influence the general dynamics of its evolution.
