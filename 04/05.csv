Agency have decided to jointly implement. SVOM has been designed to detect all
known types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), to provide fast and reliable GRB
positions, to measure the broadband spectral shape and temporal properties of
the GRB prompt emission, and to quickly identify the optical/near-infrared
afterglows of detected GRBs, including high-redshift ones. Scheduled to be in
orbit in the second half of the present decade, the SVOM satellite will carry a
very innovative scientific payload combining for the first time a wide field X-
and gamma-ray coded mask imager for GRB real-time localizations to few arcmin,
a non-imaging gamma-ray monitor, and two narrow-field instruments for the study
of the GRB early afterglow emission in the X-ray and visible bands. The SVOM
payload is complemented by ground-based instruments including a wide-field
camera to catch the GRB prompt emission in the visible band and two robotic
telescopes to measure the photometric properties of the early afterglow. A
particular attention is paid to the GRB follow-up in facilitating the
observation of the SVOM detected GRB by the largest ground based telescopes.

It enhances
the basic modal language by an operator =(). For propositional variables
p_1,...,p_n, =(p_1,...,p_(n-1);p_n) intuitively states that the value of p_n is
determined by those of p_1,...,p_(n-1). Sevenster (J. Logic and Computation,
2009) showed that satisfiability for modal dependence logic is complete for
nondeterministic exponential time. In this paper we consider fragments of modal
dependence logic obtained by restricting the set of allowed propositional
connectives. We show that satisfibility for poor man's dependence logic, the
language consisting of formulas built from literals and dependence atoms using
conjunction, necessity and possibility (i.e., disallowing disjunction), remains
NEXPTIME-complete. If we only allow monotone formulas (without negation, but
with disjunction), the complexity drops to PSPACE-completeness. We also extend
V\""a\""an\""anen's language by allowing classical disjunction besides dependence
disjunction and show that the satisfiability problem remains NEXPTIME-complete.
If we then disallow both negation and dependence disjunction, satistiability is
complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. In this way we
completely classify the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem
for all restrictions of propositional and dependence operators considered by
V\""a\""an\""anen and Sevenster.

not beyond) the horizon of a black hole. We note that in a sense the
information in the system is already lost to an observer at infinity. Once the
system is too close to the horizon it does not have enough energy to send its
information back because the information carrying quanta would get redshifted
to a point where they get confused with Hawking radiation. If one attempts to
turn the infalling system around and bring it back to infinity for observation
then it will experience Unruh radiation from the required acceleration. This
radiation can excite the bits in the system carrying the information, thus
reducing the fidelity of this information. We find the radius where the
information is essentially lost in this way, noting that this radius depends on
the energy gap (and coupling) of the system. We look for some universality by
using the highly degenerate BPS ground states of a quantum gravity theory
(string theory) as our information storage device. For such systems one finds
that the critical distance to the horizon set by Unruh radiation is the
geometric mean of the black hole radius and the radius of the extremal hole
with quantum numbers of the BPS bound state. Overall, the results suggest that
information in gravity theories should be regarded not as a quantity contained
in a system, but in terms of how much of this information is accessible to
another observer.

$\DT$ of a set $P$ of $n$ moving points in the plane, along algebraic
trajectories of constant description complexity. Since the best known upper
bound on the number of topological changes in the full $\DT$ is nearly cubic,
we seek to maintain a suitable portion of it that is less volatile yet retains
many useful properties. We introduce the notion of a stable Delaunay graph,
which is a dynamic subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation. The stable Delaunay
graph (a) is easy to define, (b) experiences only a nearly quadratic number of
discrete changes, (c) is robust under small changes of the norm, and (d)
possesses certain useful properties.
  The stable Delaunay graph ($\SDG$ in short) is defined in terms of a
parameter $\alpha>0$, and consists of Delaunay edges $pq$ for which the angles
at which $p$ and $q$ see their Voronoi edge $e_{pq}$ are at least $\alpha$. We
show that (i) $\SDG$ always contains at least roughly one third of the Delaunay
edges; (ii) it contains the $\beta$-skeleton of $P$, for
$\beta=1+\Omega(\alpha^2)$; (iii) it is stable, in the sense that its edges
survive for long periods of time, as long as the orientations of the segments
connecting (nearby) points of $P$ do not change by much; and (iv) stable
Delaunay edges remain stable (with an appropriate redefinition of stability) if
we replace the Euclidean norm by any sufficiently close norm.
  In particular, we can approximate the Euclidean norm by a polygonal norm
(namely, a regular $k$-gon, with $k=\Theta(1/\alpha)$), and keep track of a
Euclidean $\SDG$ by maintaining the full Delaunay triangulation of $P$ under
the polygonal norm.
  We describe two kinetic data structures for maintaining $\SDG$. Both
structures use $O^*(n)$ storage and process $O^*(n^2)$ events during the
motion, each in $O^*(1)$ time.

through the device. For a 2D device discretized as an N_x x N_y mesh, the best
known algorithms have a running time of O(N_x^3 N_y), whereas FIND only
requires O(N_x^2 N_y). Even though this complexity has been reduced by an order
of magnitude, the matrix inverse calculation is still the most time consuming
part in the simulation of transport problems. We could not reduce the order of
complexity, but we were able to significantly reduce the constant factor
involved in the computation cost. By exploiting the sparsity and symmetry, the
size of the problem beyond which FIND is faster than other methods typically
decreases from a 130x130 2D mesh down to a 40x40 mesh. These improvements make

equilibrium statistical mechanics for self-gravitating systems. This theory is
based on the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy and includes the generalized virial
equations as additional constraints. With the truncated distribution function
to the lowest order, we derived a set of second-order equations for the
equilibrium states of the system. In this work, the numerical solutions of
these equations are investigated. It is found that there are three types of
solutions for these equations. Both the isothermal and divergent solutions are
thermally unstable and have unconfined density profiles with infinite mass,
energy and spatial extent. The convergent solutions, however, seem to be
reasonable. Although the results cannot match the simulation data well, because
of the truncations of the distribution function and its moment equations, these
lowest-order convergent solutions show that the density profiles of the system
are confined, the velocity dispersions are variable functions of the radius,
and the velocity distributions are also anisotropic in different directions.
The convergent solutions also indicate that the statistical equilibrium of
self-gravitating systems is by no means the thermodynamic equilibrium. These
solutions are just the lowest-order approximation, but they have already
manifested the qualitative success of our theory. We expect that higher-order
solutions of our statistical-mechanical theory will give much better agreement
with the simulation results concerning dark matter haloes.

growing interest with the wealth of observational results obtained with the
CoRoT and Kepler missions. In this framework, scaling laws between
asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools to
study a rich variety of stars. However, the physical underlying mechanisms of
those scaling laws are still poorly known. Our objective is to provide a
theoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in the
power spectrum ($\nu_{\rm max}$) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off
frequency ($\nu_{\rm c}$). Using the SoHO GOLF observations together with
theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height in
oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called \emph{plateau} of the
damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be traced to the
destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy in the
upper-most layers which becomes important when the modal period and the local
thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based on this analysis, we then
find a linear relation between $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\nu_{\rm c}$, with a
coefficient that depends on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting
turbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.

disc variations being dominated by X-ray heating by the power-law, with the

set constraints on giant impacts as the cause of Neptune's current obliquity in
the framework of modern theories. We also use the present orbital properties of
the Neptunian irregular satellites (with the exception of Triton) to set
constraints on the scenario of giant impacts at the end of Neptune formation.
We model the angular momentum transfer to proto-Neptune and the impulse
transfer to its irregular satellites by the last stochastic collision (GC)
between the protoplanet and an oligarchic mass at the end of Neptune's
formation. We obtain that an impactor mass greather than 4 Earth masses is not
possible since it cannot reproduce the present rotational properties of the
planet, unless the impact parameter of the collision were very small. On the
other hand, if the impactor mass was greather than 1.4 Earth masses, the
present Neptunian irregular satellites had to be formed or captured after the
end of stochastic impacts. The upper bounds on the oligarchic masses (4 Earth
masses from the obliquity of Neptune and 1.4 earth masses from the Neptunian
irregular satellites) are independent of unknown parameters, such as the mass
and distribution of the planetesimals, the location at which Uranus and Neptune
were formed, the Solar Nebula initial surface mass density, and the growth
regime. If stochastic impacts had occurred, these results should be understood
as upper constraints on the oligarchic masses in the trans-Saturnian region at
the end of ice planet formation and may be used to set constraints on planetary

the sense that only a single parameter is left to the user. This parameter has
an intuitive interpretation as it controls the expected number of false
detections. We show that the iterative application of our method can (1)
provide robustness to noise and (2) solve a masking phenomenon in which a
highly populated and salient cluster dominates the scene and inhibits the
detection of less-populated, but still salient, clusters.

To find a block-sparse representation of a signal, we propose two classes of

convex relaxations and derive conditions under which each class of the convex

depend on the notions of mutual and cumulative subspace coherence of a

with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. Over the six years of
observation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed by
ejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. This shows a clear
connection between the radiative state near the black hole, where the X-rays
are produced, and events in the jet. The X-ray continuum flux and Fe line
intensity are strongly correlated, with a time lag shorter than 90 days and
consistent with zero. This implies that the Fe line is generated within 90
light-days of the source of the X-ray continuum. The power spectral density
function of X-ray variations contains a break, with steeper slope at shorter
timescales. The break timescale of 13 (+12,-6) days is commensurate with
scaling according to the mass of the central black hole based on observations
of Seyfert galaxies and black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). The data are
consistent with the standard paradigm, in which the X-rays are predominantly
produced by inverse Compton scattering of thermal optical/UV seed photons from
the accretion disk by a distribution of hot electrons --- the corona ---
situated near the disk. Most of the optical emission is generated in the
accretion disk due to reprocessing of the X-ray emission. The relationships
that we have uncovered between the accretion disk and the jet in 3C 111, as
well as in the FR I radio galaxy 3C 120 in a previous paper, support the

similar, with characteristic time and size scales proportional to the mass of

conclude that the warm, ionized gas in the cluster cores is photoionized by
massive, young stars in all but a few (Abell 1991, Abell 2052, Abell 2580)

have slightly lower far-UV luminosity for a given Halpha luminosity, suggesting
a harder ionization source or higher extinction. We observe a slight offset in
the UV/Halpha ratio from the expected value for continuous star formation which
can be modeled by assuming intrinsic extinction by modest amounts of dust
(E(B-V) ~ 0.2), or a top-heavy IMF in the extended filaments. The measured star
formation rates vary from ~ 0.05 Msun/yr in the nuclei of non-cooling systems,
consistent with passive, red ellipticals, to ~ 5 Msun/yr in systems with
complex, extended, optical filaments. Comparing the estimates of the star
formation rate based on UV, Halpha and infrared luminosities to the
spectroscopically-determined X-ray cooling rate suggests a star formation
efficiency of 14(+18)(-8)%. This value represents the time-averaged fraction,
by mass, of gas cooling out of the intracluster medium which turns into stars,
and agrees well with the global fraction of baryons in stars required by
simulations to reproduce the stellar mass function for galaxies. This result
provides a new constraint on the efficiency of star formation in accreting

sub-Eddington boundary on most quasar accretion, near-independence of the
accretion rate from properties of the host galaxy, and a cosmic synchronization
of accretion among black holes of a common mass. We consider how these puzzles
might change if virial mass estimation turns out to have a systematic bias. As
examples, we consider two recent claims of mass-dependent biases in MgII
masses. Under any such correction, the surprising cosmic synchronization of
quasar accretion rates and independence from the host galaxy remain. The slope
and location of the sub-Eddington boundary are very sensitive to biases in
virial mass estimation, and various mass calibrations appear to favor different
possible physical explanations for feedback between the central black hole and
its environment. The alternative mass estimators considered do not simply
remove puzzling quasar behavior, but rather replace it with new puzzles that

$HST$-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph to detect far-ultraviolet spectral features
of carbon monoxide (CO) present in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks
for the first time. We present spectra of the classical T Tauri stars HN Tau,
RECX-11, and V4046 Sgr, representative of a range of CO radiative processes. HN
Tau shows CO bands in absorption against the accretion continuum. We measure a
CO column density and rotational excitation temperature of N(CO) = 2 +/- 1
$\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ and T_rot(CO) 500 +/- 200 K for the absorbing gas.
We also detect CO A-X band emission in RECX-11 and V4046 Sgr, excited by
ultraviolet line photons, predominantly HI LyA. All three objects show emission
from CO bands at $\lambda$ $>$ 1560 \AA, which may be excited by a combination
of UV photons and collisions with non-thermal electrons. In previous
observations these emission processes were not accounted for due to blending
with emission from the accretion shock, collisionally excited H$_{2}$, and
photo-excited H2; all of which appeared as a ""continuum"" whose components could
not be separated. The CO emission spectrum is strongly dependent upon the shape
of the incident stellar LyA emission profile. We find CO parameters in the
range: N(CO) 10$^{18-19}$ cm$^{-2}$, T_{rot}(CO) > 300 K for the LyA-pumped
emission. We combine these results with recent work on photo- and
collisionally-excited H$_{2}$ emission, concluding that the observations of
ultraviolet-emitting CO and H2 are consistent with a common spatial origin. We
suggest that the CO/H2 ratio in the inner disk is ~1, a transition between the
much lower interstellar value and the higher value observed in solar system
comets today, a result that will require future observational and theoretical
study to confirm.

from our latest semi-analytic models (SAMs), which employ the main ingredients
thought to be important to galaxy formation and evolution, as well as an
improved model for reprocessing of starlight by dust to mid- and far-IR
wavelengths. These SAMs are based upon a Lambda-CDM hierarchical structural
formation scenario, and are successful in reproducing a large variety of
observational constraints such as number counts, luminosity and mass functions,
and color bimodality. Our fiducial model is based upon a WMAP5 cosmology, and
treats dust emission using empirical templates. This model predicts a
background flux considerably lower than optical and near-IR measurements that
rely on subtraction of zodiacal and galactic foregrounds, and near the lower
bounds set by number counts of resolvable sources at a large number of
wavelengths. We also show the results of varying cosmological parameters and
dust attenuation model used in our SAM. For each EBL prediction, we show how
the optical depth due to electron-positron pair-production is affected by
redshift and gamma-ray energy, and the effect of gamma-ray absorption on the
spectra of a variety of extragalactic sources. We conclude with a discussion of
the implications of our work, comparisons to other models and key measurements
of the EBL and a discussion of how the burgeoning science of gamma-ray
astronomy will continue to help constrain cosmology. The low EBL flux predicted
by our fiducial model suggests an optimistic future for further studies of
distant gamma-ray sources.

the stability of clumpy structures in nearby molecular clouds. In our recent
work, we identified a structural transition in molecular clouds by studying the
probability distributions of gas column densities in them. In this paper, we
further examine the nature of this transition. The transition takes place at
the visual extinction of A_V^tail = 2-4 mag, or equivalently, at \Sigma^tail =
40-80 Ms pc^{-2}. The clumps identified above this limit have wide ranges of
masses and sizes, but a remarkably constant mean volume density of n = 10^3
cm^{-3}. This is 5-10 times larger than the density of the medium surrounding
the clumps. By examining the stability of the clumps, we show that they are
gravitationally unbound entities, and that the external pressure from the
parental molecular cloud is a significant source of confining pressure for
them. Then, the structural transition at A_V^tail may be linked to a transition
between this population and the surrounding medium. The star formation rates in
the clouds correlate strongly with the total mass in the clumps, i.e, with the
mass above A_V^tail, dropping abruptly below that threshold. These results
imply that the formation of pressure confined clumps introduces a prerequisite
for star formation. Furthermore, they give a physically motivated explanation
for the recently reported relation between the star formation rates and the
amount of dense material in molecular clouds. Likewise, they give rise to a
natural threshold for star formation at A_V^tail.

whether these galaxies have winds of sufficient velocity to potentially clear

similar methods, as shapelets, and without producing artifacts, due to the
efficiency of the rational Chebyshev polynomials to fit quickly decaying
functions like galaxy profiles. The method is lineal and very stable, and
therefore capable of processing large numbers of galaxies in a fast and

the study of the anomalous density in terms of the interaction parameter shows

bilayer model using a spin-$S$ generalization of bond operator mean field

undergoes a field induced transition into a state with transverse N\'eel order.
Finally, we study a spin-3/2 model which interpolates between the Heisenberg

exact diagonalization, we compute the fidelity susceptibility to locate the

nearest-neighbor coupling, quadratic single-site potential, and magnetic field,
which supports four distinct ground states:
$|\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\downarrow...>$, $|\circ\circ...>$,
$|\uparrow\uparrow...>$, $|\uparrow\circ\uparrow\circ...>$. The complete
spectrum is generated from each ground state by particles from a different set
of six or seven species. Particles and elements of pseudo-vacuum are
characterized by motifs (patterns of several consecutive site variables).
Particles are floating objects that can be placed into open slots on the
lattice. Open slots are recognized as permissible links between motifs. The
energy of a particle varies between species but is independent of where it is
placed. Placement of one particle changes the open-slot configuration for
particles of all species. This statistical interaction is encoded in a
generalized Pauli principle, from which the multiplicity of states for a given
particle combination is determined and used for the exact statistical
mechanical analysis. Particles from all species belong to one of four
categories: compacts, hosts, tags, or hybrids. Compacts and hosts find open
slots in segments of pseudo-vacuum. Tags find open slots inside hosts. Hybrids
are tags with hosting capability. In the taxonomy of particles proposed here,
`species' is indicative of structure and `category' indicative of function. The
hosting function splits the Pauli principle into exclusion and accommodation
parts. Near phase boundaries, the state of the Ising chain at low temperature
is akin to that of miscible or immiscible liquids with particles from one
species acting as surfactant molecules.

made evident by the strong correlation between the spectral weight around (0.5,

resonance below the superconducting temperature, Tc, and the magnetic-field

Cosmological perturbation theory offers a natural way to study the evolution of

In this paper we get the perturbed Maxwell's equations and compute the energy
momentum tensor to second order in perturbation theory in terms of gauge
invariant quantities. Two possible scenarios are discussed, first we consider a
FLRW background without magnetic field and we study the perturbation theory
introducing the magnetic field as a perturbation. The second scenario, we

that can be included in clustering analyses, and use this to discuss the
predicted features in the Ly-alpha galaxy power-spectrum based on detailed
models in which Ly-alpha absorption is influenced by gas infall and/or by
strong galactic outflows. We show that power-spectrum measurements could be
used to study the astrophysics of the galaxy-IGM connection, and to measure the
properties of outflows from star-forming galaxies. Applying the modified
redshift space power-spectrum to a Ly-alpha survey with parameters
corresponding to the planned Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment
(HETDEX), we find that the dependence of observed Ly-alpha flux on velocity
gradient and ionising background may compromise the ability of Ly-alpha
selected galaxy redshift surveys to constrain cosmology using information from
the full power-spectrum. This is because the effects of fluctuating ionizing
background and velocity gradients effect the shape of the observed
power-spectrum in ways that are similar to the shape of the primordial
power-spectrum and redshift space distortions respectively. We use the
Alcock-Paczynski test to show that without prior knowledge of the details of
Ly-alpha absorption in the IGM, the precision of line-of-sight and transverse
distance measurements for HETDEX will be ~1.3-1.7%, decreased by a factor of
~1.5-2 relative to the best case precision of ~0.8% available in a traditional

Gaussian random fields and model them in an ""inverse procedure"" using
measurements of various properties of the fields. This article presents a
general method for this problem based on a flexible parameterization device
called ""anchors"", which captures local or global features of the fields. A
classification of all relevant data into two categories closely cooperates with
the anchor concept to enable systematic use of datasets of different sources
and disciplinary natures. In particular, nonlinearity in the ""forward models""
is handled automatically. Treatment of measurement and model errors is
systematic and integral in the method; however the method is also suitable in
the usual setting where one does not have reliable information about these
errors. Compared to a state-space approach, the anchor parameterization renders
the task in a parameter space of radically reduced dimension; consequently,
easier and more rigorous statistical inference, interpretation, and sampling
are possible. A procedure for deriving the posterior distribution of model
parameters is presented. Based on Monte Carlo sampling and normal mixture
approximation to high-dimensional densities, the procedure has generality and
efficiency features that provide a basis for practical implementations of this
computationally demanding inverse procedure. We emphasize distinguishing
features of the method compared to state-space approaches and
optimization-based ideas. Connections with existing methods in stochastic
hydrogeology are discussed. The work is illustrated by a one-dimensional

to a t-J model. The fidelity of the entangling quantum gate between the spins
is analyzed in the presence of decoherence stemming from a bath of nuclear

extending the scope of two qubit gate experiments to triple-dots, while

it also determines the quality of state transmission. In fact, we find that in
non interacting systems the exchange with fermions in the initial state of the

by scattering between hopping fermions and a proper initialization procedure.

into account dust formation and evolution by supernova (SN) explosions.
Especially we focus on the time evolution of dust size distribution, because
${\rm H}_{2}$ formation on the dust surface plays a critical role in the star
formation process in the early Universe. In the model we assume that star
formation rate (SFR) is proportional to the total amount of ${\rm H}_{2}$. We
consistently treat (i) the formation and size evolution of dust, (ii) the
chemical reaction networks including ${\rm H}_{2}$ formation both on the
surface of dust and in gas phase, and (iii) the SFR in the model. First, we
find that, because of dust destruction due to both reverse and forward shocks
driven by SNe, H$_{2}$ formation is more suppressed than that without dust
destruction. At the galaxy age of $sim0.8 {\rm Gyr}$, for galaxy models with
virial mass $M_{\rm vir}=10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and formation redshift $z_{\rm
vir}=10$, the molecular fraction is 2.5 orders of magnitude less in the model
with dust destruction by both shocks than that in the model without dust
destruction. Second, we show that the H$_{2}$ formation rate strongly depends
on the ISM density around SN progenitors. The SFR in higher ISM density is
lower, since dust destruction by reverse shocks is more effective in higher ISM
density. We conclude that not only the amount but also the size distribution of
dust being related with the star formation activity strongly affects the
evolution of galaxies in the early Universe.

constant, but its value, which we will call apparent, is normally determined
assuming that the Universe can be accurately described by a homogeneous model.
Even in the presence of a cosmological constant we cannot exclude nevertheless
the presence of a small local inhomogeneity which could affect the apparent
value of the cosmological constant. Neglecting the presence of the
inhomogeneity can in fact introduce a systematic misinterpretation of
cosmological data, leading to the distinction between an apparent and true
value of the cosmological constant. We establish the theoretical framework to
calculate the corrections to the apparent value of the cosmological constant by
modeling the local inhomogeneity with a $\Lambda LTB$ solution. Our assumption
to be at the center of a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous matter
distribution correspond to effectively calculate the monopole contribution of
the large scale inhomogeneities surrounding us, which we expect to be the
dominant one, because of other observations supporting a high level of isotropy
of the Universe around us.
  By performing a local Taylor expansion we analyze the number of independent
degrees of freedom which determine the local shape of the inhomogeneity, and
consider the issue of central smoothness, showing how the same correction can
correspond to different inhomogeneity profiles. Contrary to previous attempts
to fit data using large void models our approach is quite general. The
correction to the apparent value of the cosmological constant is in fact
present for local inhomogeneities of any size, and should always be taken
appropriately into account both theoretically and observationally.

channel, with a single antenna at the source, relay and destination nodes, in a
Rayleigh fading environment. The phase during which the relay is in reception
mode is referred to as Phase 1 and the phase during which the relay is in
transmission mode is referred to as Phase 2. The following two cases are
considered: the Non-Orthogonal Decode and Forward (NODF) scheme, in which both
the source and the relay transmit during Phase 2 and the Orthogonal Decode and
Forward (ODF) scheme, in which the relay alone transmits during Phase 2. A near
ML decoder which gives full diversity (diversity order 2) for the NODF scheme
is proposed. Due to the proximity of the relay to the destination, the
Source-Destination link, in general, is expected to be much weaker than the
Relay-Destination link. Hence it is not clear whether the transmission made by
the source during Phase 2 in the NODF scheme, provides any performance
improvement over the ODF scheme or not. In this regard, it is shown that the
NODF scheme provides significant performance improvement over the ODF scheme.
In fact, at high SNR, the performance of the NODF scheme with the non-ideal
Source-Relay link, is same as that of the NODF scheme with an ideal
Source-Relay link. In other words, to study the high SNR performance of the
NODF scheme, one can assume that the Source-Relay link is ideal, whereas the
same is not true for the ODF scheme. Further, it is shown that proper choice of
the mapping of the bits on to the signal points at the source and the relay,
provides a significant improvement in performance, for both the NODF and the
ODF schemes.

noisy channel. In a breakthrough sequence of papers published in 1992 and 1993,
Schulman gave non-constructive proofs of the existence of general methods to
emulate any two-party interactive protocol such that: (1) the emulation
protocol takes a constant-factor longer than the original protocol, and (2) if
the emulation protocol is executed over a noisy channel, then the probability
that the emulation protocol fails is exponentially small in the total length of
the protocol. Unfortunately, Schulman's emulation procedures either only work
in a model with a large amount of shared randomness, or are non-constructive in
that they rely on the existence of good tree codes. The only known proofs of
the existence of good tree codes are non-constructive, and finding an explicit
construction remains an important open problem. Indeed, randomly generated tree
codes are not good tree codes with overwhelming probability.
  In this work, we revisit the problem of reliable interactive communication,
and obtain the following results: We introduce a new notion of goodness for a
tree code, and define the notion of a potent tree code. We believe that this
notion is of independent interest. We prove the correctness of an explicit
emulation procedure based on any potent tree code. We show that a randomly
generated tree code (with suitable constant alphabet size) is a potent tree
code with overwhelming probability. Furthermore we are able to partially
derandomize this result using only O(n) random bits, where $n$ is the depth of
the tree.
  These results allow us to obtain the first fully explicit emulation procedure
for reliable interactive communication over noisy channels with a constant
communication overhead, and exponentially small failure probability.

of stability of collisionless spherical stellar systems which are the simplest
anisotropic generalization of the well-known polytrope models. Their
distribution function $F(E,L)$ is a product of power-low functions of the
energy $E$ and the angular momentum $L$, i.e. $F\propto L^{-s}(-E)^q$. On the
one hand, calculation of the growth rates in the framework of linear stability
theory and N-body simulations show that these systems become stable when the
parameter $s$ characterizing the velocity anisotropy of the stellar
distribution is lower than some finite threshold value, $s<s_\textrm{crit}$. On
the other hand Palmer & Papaloizou (1987) showed that the instability remained
up to the isotropic limit $s=0$.
  Using our method of determining the eigenmodes for stellar systems, we show
that the growth rates in weakly radially-anisotropic systems are indeed
positive, but decrease exponentially as the parameter $s$ approaches zero, i.e.
$\gamma\propto \exp(-s_{\ast}/s)$. In fact, for the systems with finite
lifetime this means stability.

the regime where the domain wall driving force is weak and its competition
against disorders is assisted by thermal agitations. Two types of driving
forces are considered; magnetic field and current. While the field induces the
domain wall motion through the Zeeman energy, the current induces the domain
wall motion by generating the spin transfer torque, of which effects in this
regime remain controversial. The spin transfer torque has two mutually
orthogonal vector components, the adiabatic spin transfer torque and the
nonadiabatic spin transfer torque. We investigate separate effects of the two
components on the domain wall depinning rate in one-dimensional systems and on
the domain wall creep velocity in two-dimensional systems, both below the
Walker breakdown threshold. In addition to the leading order contribution
coming from the field and/or the nonadiabatic spin transfer torque, we find
that the adiabatic spin transfer torque generates corrections, which can be of
relevance for an unambiguous analysis of experimental results. For instance, it
is demonstrated that the neglect of the corrections in experimental analysis
may lead to incorrect evaluation of the nonadiabaticity parameter. Effects of
the Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the domain wall motion are also analyzed.

orbital periods below 5 minutes. Accretion is slightly super--Eddington, and
makes these systems ultraluminous sources (ULXs) with rather mild beaming

2007gr. Most of the energy ($\sim2\times10^{51}$ erg) in the explosion is
contained in non-relativistic ejecta which produces the supernova. The optical
emission is coming from the decay process of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized in the
bulk SN ejecta. Only very little energy ($\sim10^{48}$ erg) is contained in the
relativistic jet with initial velocity about 0.94 times the speed of light. The
radio and X-ray emission comes from this relativistic jet. With some typical
parameters of a Wolf-Rayet star (progenitor of Type Ic SN), i.e., the mass loss
rate $\dot{M}=1.0 \times10^{-5} M_{\odot} \rm yr^{-1}$ and the wind velocity
$v_{\rm w}=1.5\times10^{3} \rm km s^{-1}$ together with an observing angle of
$\theta_{\rm obs} = 63.3^{\circ}$, we can obtain the multiband light curves
that fit the observations well. All the observed data are consistent with our
model. Thus we conclude that SN 2007gr contains a weak relativistic jet and we
are observing the jet from off-axis.

convex or non-smooth, and the limiting shape at the final time is spherical. We
provide a surprisingly large family of flows for which such results fail, by a
variety of mechanisms: Uniformly convex hypersurfaces may become non-convex,
and smooth ones may develop curvature singularities; even where this does not
occur, non-uniformly convex regions and singular parts in the initial
hypersurface may persist, including flat sides, ridges of infinite curvature,
or `cylindrical' regions where some of the principal curvatures vanish; such
cylindrical regions may persist even if the speed is positive, and in such
cases the hypersurface may even collapse to a line segment or
higher-dimensional disc rather than to a point. We provide sufficient
conditions for these various disasters to occur, and by avoiding these arrive
at a class of flows for which arbitrary weakly convex initial hypersurfaces
immediately become smooth and uniformly convex and contract to points.

In the low concentration limit, the presence of yttrium is found not to

a longer residence time at oxygen adjacent to the dopant. This lack of
influence is due to the fact that trapping occurs infrequently, even when the
proton diffuses through octahedra adjacent to the dopant. The activation energy

velocities (v_off) lying within a few thousand km/s from the quasar systemic
redshift. These associated absorption line systems (AALs) are usually
interpreted as absorbers that are either intrinsic to the quasar and its host,
or arising from external galaxies clustering around the quasar. Using composite
spectra of ~1,800 MgII AAL quasars selected from SDSS DR7 at 0.4<~ z<~2, we
show that quasars with AALs with v_off<1500 km/s have a prominent excess in
[OII]3727 emission (detected at >7sigma) at rest to the quasar host, compared
to unabsorbed quasars. We interpret this [OII] excess as due to enhanced star
formation in the quasar host. Our results suggest that a significant fraction
of AALs with v_off<1500 km/s are physically associated with the quasar and its
host, and are most likely large-scale flows with typical velocities of a few
hundred km/s. AAL quasars also have dust reddening lying between normal quasars
and the so-called dust-reddened quasars. We suggest that the unique properties
of AAL quasars can be explained if they are the transitional population from
heavily dust-reddened quasar to normal quasars in the formation process of
quasars and their hosts. This scenario predicts a larger fraction of young
bulges, disturbed morphologies and interactions of AAL quasar hosts compared to
normal quasars. The intrinsic link between associated absorbers and quasar
hosts opens a new window to probe massive galaxy formation and galactic-scale
feedback processes, and provides a crucial test of the evolutionary picture of
quasars.

treatment sessions, bladder and rectal repletion is difficult to quantify and
cannot be measured with a single and initial CT scan acquisition. Some methods,
such as image-guided radiation therapy and dose-guided radiation therapy, aimto
compensate thismissing information through periodic CT acquisitions. The aimis
to adapt patient's position, beam configuration or prescribed dose for a
dosimetric compliance. Methods. -We evaluated organmotion (and repletion) for
54 patients after having computed the original ballistic on a new CT scan
acquisition. A new delineation was done on the prostate, bladder and rectum to
determine the newdisplacements and define organ dosesmistakes (equivalent
uniformdose, average dose and dose-volume histograms). Results. - The new CT
acquisitions confirmed that bladder and rectal volumes were not constant during
sessions. Some cases showed that previously validated treatment plan became
unsuitable. A proposed solution is to correct dosimetries when bladder volume
modifications are significant. The result is an improvement for the stability
of bladder doses, D50 error is reduced by 25.3%, mean dose error by 5.1% and
equivalent uniform dose error by 2.6%. For the rectum this method decreases
errors by only 1%. This process can reduce the risk of mismatch between the
initial scan and following treatment sessions. Conclusion. - For the
proposedmethod, the cone-beamCT is necessary to properly position the isocenter
and to quantify bladder and rectal volume variation and deposited doses. The
dosimetries are performed in the event that bladder (or rectum) volume
modification limits are exceeded. To identify these limits, we have calculated
that a tolerance of 10% for the equivalent uniformdose (compared to the initial
value of the first dosimetry), this represents 11% of obsolete dosimetries for
the bladder, and 4% for the rectum.

transfer scales like Nu ~ Ra^{1/2} and turbulence intensity as Re ~ Ra^{1/2},
where the Rayleigh number Ra indicates the strength of the driving force.
However, experiments never operate in unbounded domains and it is important to
understand how confinement might alter the approach to this ultimate regime.
Here we consider homogeneous Rayleigh-Benard convection in a laterally confined
geometry - a small aspect-ratio vertical cylindrical cell - and show evidence
of the ultimate regime as Ra is increased: In spite of the confinement and the
resulting kinetic boundary layers, we still find Nu ~ Re ~ Ra^{1/2}. The system
supports exact solutions composed of modes of exponentially growing vertical
velocity and temperature fields, with Ra as the critical parameter determining
the properties of these modes. Counterintuitively, in the low Ra regime, or for
very narrow cylinders, the numerical simulations are susceptible to these
solutions which can dominate the dynamics and lead to very high and unsteady
heat transfer. As Ra is increased, interaction between modes stabilizes the
system, evidenced by the increasing homogeneity and reduced fluctuations in the
r.m.s. velocity and temperature fields. We also test that physical results
become independent of the periodicity length of the cylinder, a purely

canonical behavior, confirming the spectral states. From Swift-UVOT data we
confirm the presence of an optical counterpart which displays variability
correlated, in the soft state, to the X-ray emission observed by Swift-XRT. The
optical counterpart also displays hysteretical behaviour between the states not
normally observed in the optical bands, suggesting a possible contribution from

Our XRT timing analysis shows that in the hard state there is significant
variability below 10Hz which is more pronounced at low energies, while during
the soft state the level of variability is consistent with being minimal.These
properties of XTE J1752-223 support its candidacy as a black hole in the

at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The measurements have been carried out at
different uniaxial stresses up to $2.4\times10^5$ Pa applied along the c-axis
normal to crystal layer's plane. It is revealed that the dielectric spectra of
high-resistivity GaSe layered crystals with insulating plates obey a universal
power law ${\sim}\omega^{n-1}$, where ${\omega}$ is the angular frequency and
$n\approx 0.8$, earlier observed on high-resistivity GaSe crystals with
indium-soldered contacts. The same type of spectra on the crystals with
different types of contacts (insulating and ohmic) confirms the bulk character
of the observed polarization caused by hopping charge carriers. It is shown
that the frequency-dependent dielectric constant increases linearly with the
uniaxial stress characterized by the coefficient
${\Delta}{\epsilon}/({\epsilon}{\Delta}{p})=8{\times}10^{-7}$ Pa$^{-1}$. A
slight increase of power $1-n$ with the stress is observed, that leads to a
stronger dielectric dispersion. The strong stress dependence of the
low-frequency dielectric constant in high-resistivity GaSe crystals may be
referred to the presence of the formations of elementary dipoles, rotations of
which correspond to hops of localized charge carriers.

is to study the structure and spectral shape of the emission from the

monitoring program TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Milliarcsecond
Interferometry), VLBI observations of Cen A are made regularly at 8.4 and 22.3
GHz with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and associated telescopes in
Antarctica, Chile, and South Africa. The first dual-frequency images of this
source are presented along with the resulting spectral index map. An angular
resolution of 0.4 mas x 0.7 mas is achieved at 8.4 GHz, corresponding to a
linear scale of less than 0.013 pc. Hence, we obtain the highest resolution
VLBI image of Cen A, comparable to previous space-VLBI observations. By
combining with the 22.3 GHz image, which has been taken without contributing
transoceanic baselines at somewhat lower resolution, we present the
corresponding dual-frequency spectral index distribution along the sub-parsec
scale jet revealing the putative emission regions for recently detected
gamma-rays from the core region by Fermi/LAT. We resolve the innermost
structure of the milliarcsecond scale jet and counterjet system of Cen A into
discrete components. The simultaneous observations at two frequencies provide
the highest resolved spectral index map of an AGN jet allowing us to identify
multiple possible sites as the origin of the high energy emission.

ability for a human or machine client to define these rules requires a styling

lines. The NIR data for all BCDs have been supplemented by optical spectra. We
found the extinction coefficient in all BCDs to be very similar in both the
optical and NIR ranges. The NIR hydrogen emission lines do not reveal more star
formation than seen in the optical. The same conclusion is reached from Spitzer

MIR continuum emission in some BCDs implies that the latter arises not from the
visible H II regions themselves, but from locations outside these H II regions.

the observed optical and NIR emission lines, except in Mrk 930 where shock
ionization is needed to account for the [Fe II] emission lines. However, some
contribution of shock ionization at the level of < 10% that of stellar
ionization is required to reproduce the observed fluxes of high ionization

Gravitational radiation is modified, admitting an extra mode of oscillation,

distinct from the equivalent Kerr (or Schwarzschild) forms. We apply the
metrics to tests that could constrain f(R). We show that light deflection

precession rates are enhanced relative to general relativity; from the orbit of
Mercury we derive the bound |a_2| < 1.2 \times 10^18 m^2. Gravitational wave
astronomy may be more useful: considering the phase of a gravitational waveform
we estimate deviations from general relativity could be measurable for an
extreme-mass-ratio inspiral about a 10^6 M_sol black hole if |a_2| > 10^17 m^2,
assuming that the weak-field metric of the black hole coincides with that of a

of interest in the case that the effective form of f(R) is modified in

from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). We propose a model for the
UHECR contribution from the spin-down power of black holes (BHs) in LLAGN,
which present a jet power $P_{\mathrm{j}} \leqslant 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This
is in contrast to the opinion that only high-luminosity AGN can accelerate
particles to energies $ \geqslant 50$ EeV. We rewrite the equations which
describe the synchrotron self-absorbed emission of a non-thermal particle
distribution to obtain the observed radio flux density from flat-spectrum core
sources and its relationship to the jet power. In general, the jet power
provides the UHECR luminosity and so, its relationship to the observed radio
flux density. We found that the UHECR luminosity is dependent on the observed
radio flux density, the distance to the AGN, and the BH mass, where the
particle acceleration regions can be sustained by the magnetic energy
extraction from spinning BHs and where the strength of the magnetic field at
the sites of particle acceleration scales with the maximum value of the BH
magnetic field, which is $\sim 10^4$ gauss for a BH of $10^9 M_{\odot}$. We
apply the model to M87 and Cen A, two possible sources of UHECRs, whose jet
parameters can be inferred from observational data. Next, we use a complete
sample of 29 steep spectrum radio sources with a total flux density greater
than 0.5 Jy at 5 GHz to make predictions for the maximum particle energy,
luminosity, and flux of the UHECRs from nearby AGN. Using our proposed model,
it is possible to show that LLAGN can be sites of the origin of UHECRs. In
additional, the scenario in which the contribution to the UHECR flux from many
weak radio galaxies would dominate over that from a few strong radio galaxies,
or vice-versa, should be substantiated with further statistics.

Distributions using submm observations and then without submm observational
constraints in order to quantify the error on the dust mass when submm data are
not available. Our model does not make strong assumptions on the dust
temperature distribution to precisely avoid submm biaises in the study. Our
sample includes 52 galaxies observed at submm wavelengths. Out of these, 9
galaxies show an excess in submm which is not accounted for in our fiducial
model, most of these galaxies being low- metallicity dwarfs. We chose to add an
independant very cold dust component (T=10K) to account for this excess. We
find that metal-rich galaxies modelled with submm data often show lower dust
masses than when modelled without submm data. Indeed, these galaxies usually
have dust SEDs that peaks at longer wavelengths and require constraints above
160 um to correctly position the peak and sample the submillimeter slope of
their SEDs and thus correctly cover the dust temperature distribution. On the
other hand, some metal-poor dwarf galaxies modelled with submm data show higher
dust masses than when modelled without submm data. Using submm constraints for
the dust mass estimates, we find a tightened correlation of the dust-to-gas
mass ratio with the metallicity of the galaxies. We also often find that when
there is a submm excess present, it occurs preferentially in low-metallicity
galaxies. We analyse the conditions for the presence of this excess and find a

questions of particle physics and many extensions of the Standard Model have
been proposed in that direction. This experimental evidence is a very robust
indication of new physics, but is not the only reason to go beyond the Standard
Model. The existence of some theoretical issues supports the idea of a wider
framework, supersymmetry being the most popular one. In this thesis, several
supersymmetric neutrino mass models have been studied. In the first part, the
phenomenology of models with bilinear-like R-parity violation is discussed in
great detail, highlighting the most distinctive signatures at colliders and low
energy experiments. In particular, the correlations between the LSP decay and
neutrino physics are shown to be a powerful tool to put this family of models
under experimental test. Other important signatures are investigated as well,
like majoron emission in charged lepton decays for the case of models with
spontaneous breaking of R-parity. A very different approach is followed in the
second part of the thesis. Supersymmetric models with a Left-Right symmetry
have all the ingredients to incorporate a type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino
masses and conserve R-parity at low energies. In this case, which only allows
for indirect tests, the generation of neutrino masses at the high seesaw scale
is encoded at low energies in the slepton soft masses. Contrary to minimal
seesaw models, sizeable flavor violation in the right slepton sector is
expected. Its experimental observation would be a clear hint of an underlying
Left-Right symmetry, providing valuable information about physics at very high
energies.

prescriptions for the thermohaline mixing regimes. In particular we adopt a
self-consistent double-diffusive convection theory, that allows to handle the
instabilities that arise when thermal and composition gradients compete against
each other, and a very recent empirically motivated and parameter free
asymptotic scaling law for thermohaline composition transport. In agreement
with previous works, we find that during the red giant stage, a thermohaline
instability sets in shortly after the hydrogen burning shell (HBS) encounters
the chemical discontinuity left behind by the first dredge-up. We also find
that the thermohaline unstable region, initially appearing at the exterior wing
of the HBS, is unable to reach the outer convective envelope, with the
consequence that no mixing of elements that produces a non-canonical
modification of the stellar surface abundances occurs. Also in agreement with
previous works, we find that by artificially increasing the mixing efficiency
of thermohaline regions it is possible to connect both unstable regions, thus
affecting the photospheric composition. However, we find that in order to
reproduce the observed abundances of red giant branch stars close to the
luminosity bump, thermohaline mixing efficiency has to be artificially
increased by about 4 orders of magnitude from that predicted by recent 3D
numerical simulations of thermohaline convection close to astrophysical
environments. From this we conclude the chemical abundance anomalies of red
giant stars cannot be explained on the basis of thermohaline mixing alone.

stronger in the redder wavebands. We attribute this to the polarimetric
signature of synchrotron emission from jets in these systems, the emission of
which is known to dominate these redder bands. Such synchrotron emission from
jets launched close to black holes and neutron stars can be highly linearly
polarized, depending on the configuration of the magnetic field. The
variability of the polarization is suggestive of a tangled and turbulent
magnetic field at the location of the compact jet. For some sources the
position angle of polarization is consistent with a magnetic field that is
parallel to the observed radio jet. These are some of the first observational
constraints of the geometry and magnetic structure at the inner regions of the

different approaches have been developed to enhance the efficiency of the

systems, numerical models of human, etc. have been implemented in numerical
ergonomic software. Until now, there are ergonomic software tools available,
such as Jack, Ergoman, Delmia Human, 3DSSPP, and Santos, etc. [2-4]. The main
functions of these tools are posture analysis and posture prediction. In the
visualization part, Jack and 3DSSPP produce results to visualize virtual human
tasks in 3-dimensional, but without realistic physical properties. Nowadays,
with the development of computer technology, the simulation of physical world
is paid more attention. Physical engines [5] are used more and more in computer

environment simulation. The purpose of our research is to use the CG technology
to create a virtual environment with physical properties for ergonomic analysis

most sizes of compilation results increase exponentially with the number of

flare kernels it is necessary to assume what is the extension of a kernel along

densities. In our previous paper (Bak-Steslicka and Jakimiec, 2005) we have
worked out another method of deriving electron density, in which it is not
necessary to assume what is the extension of a kernel along the line of sight.
The point is that many flares, during their decay phase, evolve along the
sequence of steady-state models [quasi-steady-state (QSS) evolution] and then
the scaling law, derived for steady-state models, can be used to determine the
electron density. The aim of the present paper is: (1) to improve the two
methods of density determination, (2) to compare the densities obtained with
the two methods. We have selected a number of flares which showed QSS evolution
during the decay phase. For these flares the electron density, N, has been
derived by means of standard method and with our QSS method. Comparison of the
N values obtained with the two different methods allowed us: (1) to test the
obtained densities, (2) to evaluate the volume filling factor of the SXR
emitting plasma. Generally, we have found good agreement (no large systematic
difference) between the values of electron density obtained with the two
methods, but for some cases the values can differ by a factor up to 2. For most
flare kernels estimated filling factor turned out to be about 1, near the flare

of its close distance and high luminosity, IRAS 17233-3606 is a potential good
laboratory to search for traces of rotation in the inner gas around the
protostar(s). Therefore, we selected the source for a detailed analysis of its
molecular emission at 230 GHz with the SMA. We systematically investigated the
velocity fields of transitions in the SMA spectra which are not affected by
overlap with other transitions, and searched for coherent velocity gradients to
compare them to the distribution of outflows in the region. Beside CO emission
we also used high-angular H2 images to trace the outflow motions driven by the
IRAS 17233-3606 cluster. We find linear velocity gradients in many transitions
of the same molecular species and in several molecules. We report the first
detection of HNCO in molecular outflows from massive YSOs. We discuss the CH3CN
velocity gradient taking into account various scenarios: rotation, presence of
multiple unresolved sources with different velocities, and outflow(s). Although
other interpretations cannot be ruled out, we propose that the CH3CN emission
might be affected by the outflows of the region. Higher angular observations
are needed to discriminate between the different scenarios. The present
observations, with the possible association of CH3CN with outflows in a few
thousands AU around the YSOs' cluster, (i) question the choice of the tracer to
probe rotating structures, and (ii) show the importance of the use of H2 images

highest luminosity ~1.4E+38 erg/s, considerably brighter than any outbursts
from the neutron star transients Aql X-1 or 4U 1608-452; the outburst
apparently started ~45 days earlier than the observed peak, hence the
luminosity could have been considerably higher. We identified XB082, XB153 and
XB185 as BHCs by observing ""low state"" emission spectra at luminosities that
exceed the threshold for neutron star binaries. The probability that these are
neutron star systems with anisotropic emission beamed toward us is <4E-4, and
their variability suggests emission from a single source. We therefore conclude
that these systems likely contain black holes rather than neutron stars. We
have now identified 4 persistently bright BHCs in the region; the probability
that these are all background AGN is <1E-20. According to theory, the donors
could be tidally captured main sequence stars, or white dwarves in
ultra-compact binaries. We find that GCs that are particularly massive (XB082)
or metal rich (XB144) can host bright X-ray sources in addition to those that
are both (XB163). Our method may reveal BHCs in other bright X-ray sources.

nova outburst. When the ejected material carries away the specific angular
momentum of the white dwarf, the orbital period increases. A magnetic field on
the surface of the secondary star forces a fraction of the ejected material to
corotate with the star, and hence the binary system. The ejected material thus
takes angular momentum from the binary orbit and the orbital period decreases.
We show that for sufficiently strong magnetic fields on the surface of the
secondary star, the total change to the orbital period could even be negative
during a nova outburst, contrary to previous expectations. Accurate
determinations of pre- and post-outburst orbital periods of recurrent nova
systems could test the new mechanism, in addition to providing meaningful
constraints on otherwise difficult to measure physical quantities. We apply our
mechanism to outbursts of the recurrent nova U Sco.

framework that allows to investigate tractability beyond this setting. The key
insight is that, although the cardinality of a query result can be exponential,
its structure can be very regular and thus factorisable into a nested
representation whose size is only polynomial in the size of both the input

  For a given query result, there may be several equivalent representations,
and we quantify the regularity of the result by its readability, which is the
minimum over all its representations of the maximum number of occurrences of

considered. It is shown that information can be stored and retrieved using the
optical diffraction patterns obtained by the illumination of a large array of
cantilevers by a monochromatic light source. In thermo-mechanical probe
storage, the information is stored as a sequence of indentations on the polymer
medium. To retrieve the information, the array of probes is actuated by
applying a bending force to the cantilevers. Probes positioned over
indentations experience deflection by the depth of the indentation, probes over
the flat media remain un-deflected. Thus the array of actuated probes can be
viewed as an irregular optical grating, which creates a data-dependent
diffraction pattern when illuminated by laser light. We develop a low
complexity modulation scheme, which allows the extraction of information stored
in the pattern of indentations on the media from Fourier coefficients of the
intensity of the diffraction pattern. We then derive a low-complexity maximum
likelihood sequence detection algorithm for retrieving the user information
from the Fourier coefficients. The derivation of both the modulation and the
detection schemes is based on the Fraunhofer formula for data-dependent
diffraction patterns. We show that for as long as the Fresnel number F<0.1, the
optimal channel detector derived from Fraunhofer diffraction theory does not
suffer any significant performance degradation.

One more source of nuclear forces is associated with inerton clouds,
