fields from small Nb rings at cryogenic temperatures that are about 18 orders
of magnitude larger than gravitomagnetic fields obtained from GR (general
relativity). Cifuolini in 2004 and the NASA-Stanford Gravity Probe-B experiment
in 2007 confirmed the Lense-Thirring effect as predicted by GR (gravitomagnetic
fields generated by a rotating massive body, i.e. Earth) within some 10%. In
2007 gravitomagnetic fields generated by a rotating cryogenic lead disk were
measured by Graham et al. Though these measurements were not conclusive (the
accuracy of the laser gyrometer was not sufficient to produce a standard
deviation small enough) their experiment seems to have seen the same phenomenon
reported earlier by Tajmar et al., termed parity violation. This means that
gravitomagnetic fields produced by the cryogenic rotating ring or disk vary
substantially and change sign for clockwise and counter-clockwise directions of
rotation. The experimental situation therefore occurs to be contradictory. On
the one hand GR has been confirmed while at the same time, there seems to be
experimental evidence for the existence of extreme gravitomagnetic fields that
cannot be generated by the movement of large masses. If these experiments can
be confirmed, they give a clear indication for the existence of additional
gravitational fields of non-Newtonian nature. As was shown by the GP-B
experiment, measuring gravitomagnetic fields from GR poses extreme
difficulties. Therefore a novel physical mechanism should exist for the
generation of gravity-like fields, which might also provide the key to
gravitational engineering similar to electromagnetic technology.

It is usually used to improve the generalization performance when the number of

regularization of a parametric model can be achieved in different manners some

smoothing that are used to avoid overfitting during the training of the

correspond to imposing certain prior distributions on model parameters (Krogh

the coefficients of the regularization terms induced by the noisy input. In

from a homogenous material, however, generally show considerable light
transmission accompanied by heating due to light absorption, which typically
reduces the mechanical quality and limits quantum opto-mechanical experiments
in particular at low temperatures. In this work, we experimentally analyze a
Michelson-Sagnac interferometer including a translucent silicon nitride (SiN)

provides an operational point being optimally suited for quantum
opto-mechanical experiments with translucent oscillators. In case of a balanced
beam splitter of the interferometer, the membrane can be placed at a node of
the electro-magnetic field, which simultaneously provides lowest absorption and
optimum laser noise rejection at the signal port. We compare the optical and

the SiN membrane can be coupled to a laser power of the order of one Watt at
1064 nm without significantly degrading the membrane's quality factor of the

the Fermi liquid, exists in the phase diagram of the 2D Hubbard model
[Vidhyadhiraja et. al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 206407 (2009)]. Due to the
vanishing of the critical temperature associated with a phase separation
transition, the QCP is characterized by a vanishing quasiparticle weight. Near
the QCP, the pairing is enhanced since the real part of the bare d-wave p-p
susceptibility exhibits algebraic divergence with decreasing temperature,
replacing the logarithmic divergence found in a Fermi liquid [Yang et. al,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 047004 (2011)]. In this paper we explore the
single-particle and transport properties near the QCP. We focus mainly on a van
Hove singularity (vHS) coming from the relatively flat dispersion that crosses
the Fermi level near the quantum critical filling. The flat part of the
dispersion orthogonal to the antinodal direction remains pinned near the Fermi
level for a range of doping that increases when we include a negative
next-near-neighbor hopping t' in the model. For comparison, we calculate the
bare d-wave pairing susceptibility for non-interacting models with the usual
two-dimensional tight binding dispersion and a hypothetical quartic dispersion.
We find that neither model yields a vHS that completely describes the critical
algebraic behavior of the bare d-wave pairing susceptibility. The resistivity,
thermal conductivity, thermopower, and the Wiedemann-Franz Law are examined in
the Fermi liquid, marginal Fermi liquid, and pseudo-gap doping regions. A
negative next-near-neighbor hopping t' increases the doping region with
marginal Fermi liquid character. Both T and negative t' are relevant variables
for the QCP, and both the transport and the motion of the vHS with filling
suggest that they are qualitatively similar in their effect.

coherent light at a beamsplitter it is possible to generate NOON states of
arbitrary N with a fidelity as high as 94%. (Afek I. et al. Science 328, 879

down-converted light and ""classical"" coherent light. However, this requires
optimizing the amplitude ratio of classical to quantum light thereby limiting
the overall count rate for the interferometric super-resolution signal. We
propose using coherent-beam-stimulated non-collinear down converted light as
input to the interferometer. Our scheme is based on stimulation of
non-collinear parametric down conversion by two-mode coherent light. We have
somehow a better flexibility of choosing the amplitude ratio in generating NOON
states. This enables super-resolution intensity exceeding the previous scheme
by many orders of magnitude. Therefore we hope to improve the magnitude of
N-fold super-resolution in quantum interferometry for arbitrary N by using
bright light sources. We give some results for N=4 and 5.

toward the Earth, like a pulsar. We observed CU Vir in April 2010 with the EVLA

in particular with the Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) from Earth, which
originates at few terrestrial radii above the magnetic poles and was only

geometrical cross section of the black hole photon sphere and the contribution
of a sinc function involving the geometrical characteristics (orbital period
and Lyapunov exponent) of the null unstable geodesics lying on this photon
sphere. From a numerical analysis, we show that, beyond the eikonal
description, this absorption cross section presents a simple fine structure. We
then describe it analytically by using Regge pole techniques and interpret it
in geometrical terms. We naturally extend our analysis to arbitrary static
spherically symmetric black holes endowed with a photon sphere and we then
apply our formalism to Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Reissner-Nordstr\""om black
holes. Finally, on the example of the Schwarzschild black hole, we show
numerically that a complicated hyperfine structure lying beyond the fine
structure can also be observed.

on the hidden local symmetry (HLS), which arises from the gauge invariant terms
for intrinsic parity-odd (IP-odd) part of the effective action. Those terms are
given as the homogeneous part of the general solution (having free parameters)
to the Wess-Zumino (WZ) anomaly equation and hence are not determined by the
anomaly, in sharp contrast to the Harvey-Hill-Hill (HHH) action where the
relevant vertex is claimed to be uniquely determined by the anomaly. We show
that, even in the framework that HHH was based on, the omega-Z-gamma vertex is
actually not determined by the anomaly but by the homogeneous (anomaly-free)
part of the general solution to the WZ anomaly equation having free parameters
in the same way as in the HLS formulation: The HHH action is just a particular
choice of the free parameters in the general solution. We further show that the
omega-Z-gamma vertex related to the neutrino (nu) - nucleon (N) scattering
cross section sigma(nu N -> nu N (N')gamma) is determined not by the anomaly
but by the anomaly-free part of the general solution having free parameters.
Nevertheless we find that the cross section sigma(nu N -> nu N(N')gamma) is
related through the Ward-Takahashi identity to Gamma(omega -> pi^0 gamma) which
has the same parameter-dependence as that of sigma(nu N -> nu N(N')gamma) and
hence the ratio sigma(nu N -> nu N(N')gamma)/Gamma(omega -> pi^0 gamma) is
fixed independently of these free parameters. Other set of the free parameters
of the general solution can be fixed to make the best fit of the omega -> pi^0
l^+ l^- process, which substantially differs from the HHH action. This gives a
prediction of the cross section sigma(nu N -> nu N (N')gamma^*(l^+ l^-)) to be
tested at nu-N collision experiments in the future.

Neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes can form evolutionary a compact
self-gravitating subsystem in the galactic center. Collisions and merges of
these stellar remnants during an avalanche contraction and collapse of the
cluster core can produce powerful events in different bands due to several
mechanisms. Collisions of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes can
generate gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) similar to the ordinary models of short GRB
origin. The bright peaks during the first two days may also be a consequence of
multiple matter supply (due to matter release in the collisions) and accretion
onto the forming supermassive black hole. Numerous smaller peaks and later
quasi-steady radiation can arise from gravitational lensing, late accretion of
gas onto the supermassive black hole, and from particle acceleration by shock
waves. Even if this model will not reproduce exactly all the Swift
J164449.3+573451 properties in future observations, such collapses of galactic

other galaxies and the gas in galaxies is extremely sensitive to the
interactions. One method to measure such interactions uses the quantified
morphology of galaxy images. Well-established parameters are Concentration,
Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini, and M20 of a galaxy image. Thus far, the
application of this technique has mostly been restricted to restframe
ultra-violet and optical images. However, with the new radio observatories
being commissioned (MeerKAT, ASKAP, EVLA, WSRT/APERTIF, and ultimately SKA), a
new window on the neutral atomic hydrogen gas (HI) morphology of a large
numbers of galaxies will open up. The quantified morphology of gas disks of
spirals can be an alternative indicator of the level and frequency of
interaction. The HI in galaxies is typically spatially more extended and more
sensitive to low-mass or weak interactions. In this paper, we explore six
morphological parameters calculated over the extent of the stellar (optical)
disk and the extent of the gas disk for a range of wavelengths spanning UV,
Optical, Near- and Far-Infrared and 21 cm (HI) of 28 galaxies from The HI
Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). Though the THINGS sample is small and contains
only a single ongoing interaction, it spans both non-interacting and
post-interacting galaxies with a wealth of multi-wavelength data. We find that
the choice of area for the computation of the morphological parameters is less
of an issue than the wavelength at which they are measured. The signal of
interaction is as good in the HI as in any of the other wavelengths in which
morphology has been used to trace the interaction rate to date, mostly
star-formation dominated ones (near- and far-ultraviolet). The Asymmetry and
M20 parameters are the ones which show the most promise as tracers of
interaction in 21 cm line observations.

disk morphology, profile and kinematics. Simultaneously, the asymmetry of a
galaxy's stellar disk, in combination with other morphological parameters, has
seen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxy
samples. Quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue to
determine the merger rate over much of the age of the Universe. In this paper,
we measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the HI column density
maps from the Westerbork observations of neutral Hydrogen in Irregular and
SPiral galaxies (WHISP). These are Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini,
M20, and one addition of our own, the Gini parameter of the second order moment
(GM). Our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can be
identified with these parameters. Our sample of 141 HI maps have all previous
classifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. We find that the
Asymmetry, M20, and our new GM parameter correlate only weakly with the
previous morphological lopsidedness quantification. These three parameters may
be used to compute a probability that an HI disk is morphologically lopsided
but not unequivocally to determine it. However, we do find that that the
question whether or not an HI disk is interacting can be settled well using
morphological parameters. Parameter cuts from the literature do not translate
from ultraviolet to HI directly but new selection criteria using combinations
of Asymmetry and M20 or Concentration and M20, work very well. We suggest that
future all-sky HI surveys may use these parameters of the column density maps
to determine the merger fraction and hence rate in the local Universe with a
high degree of accuracy.

first component to be disturbed by a gravitational interaction such as a merger
between two galaxies. We use a simple parametrisation of the morphology of HI
column density maps of Westerbork HI Spiral Project (WHISP) to select those
galaxies that are likely undergoing a significant interaction. Merging galaxies
occupy a particular part of parameter space defined by Asymmetry (A), the
relative contribution of the 20% brightest pixels to the second order moment of
the column density map (M20) and the distribution of the second order moment
over all the pixels (GM). Based on their HI morphology, we find that 13% of the
WHISP galaxies are in an interaction (Concentration-M20) and only 7% based on
close companions in the data-cube. This apparent discrepancy can be attributed
to the difference in visibility time scales: mergers are identifiable as close
pairs for 0.5 Gyr but ~1 Gyr by their disturbed HI morphology. Expressed as
volume merger rates, the two estimates agree very well: 7 and 6.8 x 10^-3
mergers Gyr^-1 Mpc^-3 for paired and morphologically disturbed HI disks
respectively. The consistency of our merger fractions to those published for
bigger surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, shows that HI morphology
can be a very viable way to identify mergers in a large HI survey. The
relatively high value for the volume merger rate may be a bias in the selection
or WHISP volume. The expected boon in high-resolution HI data by the planned

of mergers in the local Universe and, with the advent of SKA, over cosmic

Virgo cluster. These galaxies display a wealth of phenomena in their Hi
morphology, e.g., tails, truncation and warps. These morphological disturbances
are related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies
undergo in this dense cluster environment. To quantify the morphological
transformation of the HI disks, we compute the morphological parameters of CAS,
Gini, and M20 and our own GM for 51 galaxies in 48 HI column density maps from
the VIVA project. Some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space
of relatively low resolution HI data. Truncation of the HI disk can be cleanly
identified via the Concentration parameter (C<1) and Concentration can also be
used to identify HI deficient disks (1<C<5). Tidal interaction is typically
identified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to
(optical) images of galaxies. We find that some selection criteria (Gini-M20,
Asymmetry, and a modified Concentration-M20) are still applicable for the
coarse (~15"" FWHM) VIVA HI data. The phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonably
well identified using the Gini-M20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tails
identified but with as many contaminants). Ram-pressure does move HI disks into
and out of most of our interaction criteria: the ram-pressure sequence
identified by Vollmer et al. (2009) tracks into and out of some of these
criteria (Asymmetry based and the Gini-M20 selections, but not the
Concentration-M20 or the GM based ones). Therefore, future searches for
interaction using HI morphologies should take ram-pressure into account as a
mechanism to disturb HI disks enough to make them appear as gravitationally
interacting. One mechanism would be to remove all the HI deficient (C<5) disks
from the sample, as these have undergone more than one HI removal mechanism.

galaxy evolution. To trace the fraction and the rate galaxies are in mergers
over cosmic times, several observational techniques, including morphological
selection criteria, have been developed over the last decade. We apply this
morphological selection of mergers to 21 cm radio emission line (HI) column
density images of spiral galaxies in nearby surveys. In this paper, we
investigate how long a 1:1 merger is visible in HI from N-body simulations. We
evaluate the merger visibility times for selection criteria based on four
parameters: Concentration, Asymmetry, M20, and the Gini parameter of second
order moment of the flux distribution (GM). Of three selection criteria used in
the literature, one based on Concentration and M20 works well for the HI
perspective with a merger time scale of 0.4 Gyr. Of the three selection
criteria defined in our previous paper, the GM performs well and cleanly
selects mergers for 0.69 Gyr. The other two criteria (A-M20 and C-M20), select
isolated disks as well, but perform best for face-on, gas-rich disks (T(merger)
~ 1 Gyr). The different visibility scales can be combined with the selected
fractions of galaxies in any large HI survey to obtain merger rates in the
nearby Universe. All-sky surveys such as WALLABY with ASKAP and the Medium Deep
Survey with the APETIF instrument on Westerbork are set to revolutionize our
perspective on neutral hydrogen and will provide an accurate measure of the
merger fraction and rate of the present epoch.

One problem of characterizing its large-scale structure is that it is hard to
know what to compare it to. All chemical reaction systems are shaped by the
same physics that gives molecules their stability and affinity to react. These
fundamental factors cannot be captured by standard null-models based on
randomization. The unique property of organismal metabolism is that it is
controlled, to some extent, by an enzymatic machinery that is subject to
evolution. In this paper, we explore the possibility that reaction systems of
planetary atmospheres can serve as a null-model against which we can define
metabolic structure and trace the influence of evolution. We find that the two
types of data can be distinguished by their respective degree distributions.
This is especially clear when looking at the degree distribution of the
reaction network (of reaction connected to each other if they involve the same
molecular species). For the Earth's atmospheric network and the human metabolic
network, we look into more detail for an underlying explanation of this
deviation. However, we cannot pinpoint a single cause of the difference, rather
there are several concurrent factors. By examining quantities relating to the
modular-functional organization of the metabolism, we confirm that metabolic
networks have a more complex modular organization than the atmospheric
networks, but not much more. We interpret the more variegated modular
arrangement of metabolism as a trace of evolved functionality. On the other
hand, it is quite remarkable how similar the structures of these two types of
networks are, which emphasizes that the constraints from the chemical
properties of the molecules has a larger influence in shaping the reaction
system than does natural selection.

effects in recombination via different states. We demonstrate that four quantum
paths of electron contribute in the harmonic spectrum. The harmonic conversion
efficiency is directly proportional to the initial-state amplitudes and
depletion of the states (especially excited state), the remained population of
the bound states at the time of recombination and the distinct dipole
strengths. The main contribution to high conversion efficiency is the
transition from the excited to the ground state.
