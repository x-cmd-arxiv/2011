R_{AA}^pi(p_T,s), of high p_T pions produced in Pb+Pb collisions at
sqrt{s}_{NN}=2.76 and 5.5 ATeV based on the WHDG/DGLV
(radiative+elastic+geometric fluctuation) jet energy loss model. The initial
quark gluon plasma (QGP) density at LHC is constrained from a rigorous
statistical analysis of PHENIX/RHIC pi^0 quenching data at sqrt{s}_{NN}=0.2
ATeV and the charged particle multiplicity at ALICE/LHC at 2.76 ATeV. Our
perturbative QCD tomographic theory predicts significant differences between
jet quenching at RHIC and LHC energies, which are qualitatively consistent with
the p_T-dependence and normalization---within the large systematic
uncertainty---of the first charged hadron nuclear modification factor,
R^{ch}_{AA}, data measured by ALICE. However, our constrained prediction of the
central to peripheral pion modification, R^pi_{cp}(p_T), for which large
systematic uncertainties associated with unmeasured p+p reference data cancel,
is found to be over-quenched relative to the charged hadron ALICE R^{ch}_{cp}
data in the range 5<p_T<20 GeV/c. The discrepancy challenges the two most basic
jet tomographic assumptions: (1) that the energy loss scales linearly with the
initial local comoving QGP density, rho_0, and (2) that \rho_0 \propto
dN^{ch}(s,C)/dy is proportional to the observed global charged particle
multiplicity per unit rapidity as a function of sqrt{s} and centrality class,
C. Future LHC identified (h=pi,K,p) hadron R^h_{AA} data (together with precise
p+p, p+Pb, and Z boson and direct photon Pb+Pb control data) are needed to
assess if the QGP produced at LHC is indeed less opaque to jets than predicted
by constrained extrapolations from RHIC.

classical and resonant Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). This is partially motivated
by the observed bimodal inclination distribution and by the putative physical
differences between the low- and high-inclination populations. We find that
some classical KBOs undergo large changes in inclination over gigayear
timescales, which means that a current member of the low-inclination population
may have been in the high-inclination population in the past, and vice versa.
The dynamical mechanisms responsible for the time-variability of inclinations
are predominantly distant encounters with Neptune and chaotic diffusion near
the boundaries of mean motion resonances. We reassess the correlations between
inclination and physical properties including inclination time-variability. We
find that the size-inclination and color-inclination correlations are less
statistically significant than previously reported (mostly due to the increased
size of the data set since previous works with some contribution from
inclination variability). The time-variability of inclinations does not change
the previous finding that binary classical KBOs have lower inclinations than
non-binary objects. Our study of resonant objects in the classical Kuiper belt
region includes objects in the 3:2, 7:4, 2:1, and eight higher-order mean
motion resonances. We find that these objects (some of which were previously
classified as non-resonant) undergo larger changes in inclination compared to
the non-resonant population, indicating that their current inclinations are not
generally representative of their original inclinations. They are also less
stable on gigayear timescales.

analysis shows that, at typical experimental parameters, thermodynamics favors
the formation of van der Waals complexes composed of a helium atom bound to
most open-shell atoms and molecules, and that complex formation occurs quickly
enough to ensure chemical equilibrium. For molecular pairs composed of a He
atom and an S-state atom, the molecular spin is stable during formation,
dissociation, and collisions, and thus these molecules can be magnetically
trapped. Collisional spin relaxations are too slow to affect trap lifetimes.
However, helium-3-containing complexes can change spin due to adiabatic
crossings between trapped and untrapped Zeeman states, mediated by the
anisotropic hyperfine interaction, causing trap loss. We provide a detailed
model for Ag3He molecules, using ab initio calculation of Ag-He interaction
potentials and spin interactions, quantum scattering theory, and direct Monte
Carlo simulations to describe formation and spin relaxation in this system. The
calculated rate of spin-change agrees quantitatively with experimental

similar to the values observed in the nearly-isotropic comets. Given the
predicted strong variation of D/H with heliocentric distance in the solar
nebula, this observation links the primordial source region of the
nearly-isotropic comets with the formation location of Enceladus. That is,
comets from the nearly-isotropic class were most likely fed into their current
reservoir, the Oort cloud, from a source region near the formation location of
Enceladus. Dynamical simulations of the formation of the Oort cloud indicate
that Uranus and Neptune are, primarily, responsible for the delivery of
material into the Oort cloud. In addition, Enceladus formed from material that
condensed from the solar nebula near the location at which Saturn captured its
gas envelope, most likely at or near Saturn's current location in the solar
system. The coupling of these lines of evidence appears to require that Uranus
and Neptune were, during the epoch of the formation of the Oort cloud, much
closer to the current location of Saturn than they are currently. Such a
configuration is consistent with the Nice model of the evolution of the outer
solar system. Further measurements of the D/H enrichment in comets,
particularly in ecliptic comets, will provide an excellent discriminator among
various models of the formation of the outer solar system.

0, we can compute a value v that approximates the value of the OC-SSG
termination game within additive error epsilon, and furthermore we can compute
epsilon-optimal strategies for both players in the game. A key ingredient in
our proofs is a subtle martingale, derived from solving certain LPs that we can
associate with a maximizing OC-MDP. An application of Azuma's inequality on
these martingales yields a computable bound for the ""wealth"" at which a ""rich
person's strategy"" becomes epsilon-optimal for OC-MDPs.

believed to be stable, and it is this longevity that holds the promise of
precision studies of matter-antimatter symmetry. We have recently demonstrated
trapping of antihydrogen atoms by releasing them after a confinement time of
172 ms. A critical question for future studies is: how long can anti-atoms be
trapped? Here we report the observation of anti-atom confinement for 1000 s,
extending our earlier results by nearly four orders of magnitude. Our
calculations indicate that most of the trapped anti-atoms reach the ground
state. Further, we report the first measurement of the energy distribution of
trapped antihydrogen which, coupled with detailed comparisons with simulations,
provides a key tool for the systematic investigation of trapping dynamics.
These advances open up a range of experimental possibilities, including
precision studies of CPT symmetry and cooling to temperatures where

In 2000, Baier, Haverkort, Hermanns and Katoen presented an efficient
polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the sublogic in which only binary
until is allowed. In this paper, we propose such an efficient polynomial-time
approximation algorithm for full CSL. The key to our method is the notion of
stratified CTMCs with respect to the CSL property to be checked. On a
stratified CTMC, the probability to satisfy a CSL path formula can be
approximated by a transient analysis in polynomial time (using uniformization).
We present a measure-preserving, linear-time and -space transformation of any
CTMC into an equivalent, stratified one. This makes the present work the
centerpiece of a broadly applicable full CSL model checker. Recently, the
decision algorithm by Aziz et al. was shown to work only for stratified CTMCs.
As an additional contribution, our measure-preserving transformation can be
used to ensure the decidability for general CTMCs.

towards a more ambitious scope: explaining scale invariant avalanches. In two
decades, phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, granular piles, snow avalanches,
solar flares, superconducting vortices, sub-critical fracture, evolution, and
even stock market crashes have been reported to evolve through scale invariant
avalanches. The theory, based on the key axiom that a critical state is an
attractor of the dynamics, presented an exponent close to -1 (in two
dimensions) for the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes. However, the
majority of real phenomena classified as SOC present smaller exponents, i.e.,
larger absolute values of negative exponents, a situation that has provoked a
lot of confusion in the field of scale invariant avalanches. The main goal of
this chapter is to shed light on this issue. The essential role of the exponent
value of the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes is discussed. The
exponent value controls the ratio of small and large events, the energy balance
--required for stationary systems-- and the critical properties of the
dynamics. A condition of criticality is introduced. As the exponent value
decreases, there is a decrease of the critical properties, and consequently the
system becomes, in principle, predictable. Prediction of scale invariant
avalanches in both experiments and simulations are presented. Other sources of
confusion as the use of logarithmic scales, and the avalanche dynamics in well
established critical systems, are also revised; as well as the influence of
dissipation and disorder in the ""self-organization"" of scale invariant
dynamics.

conformal, rather than (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry. In particular masses
become geometric quantities, namely the weights of tractor fields. Massive

gauge principle usually employed for massless models. From a holographic
viewpoint, these models describe both the bulk and boundary theories in terms

involving the use of a spacecraft moving along a highly eccentric heliocentric
orbit perpendicular to the ecliptic. It aims to accurately measure some
important physical properties of the Sun and to test some post-Newtonian
features of its gravitational field by continuously monitoring the Earth-probe
range. Preliminary sensitivity analyses show that, by assuming a cm-level
accuracy in ranging to the spacecraft, it would be possible to detect, in
principle, the Lense-Thirring effect on it at a 10^-3-10^-4 level over a
timescale of 2 yr, while the larger Schwarzschild component of the solar
gravitational field may be sensed with a relative accuracy of about 10^-8-10^-9
during the same temporal interval. The competing range perturbation due to the
non-sphericity of the Sun would be a source of systematic error, but it turns
out that all the three dynamical features of motion examined affect the
Earth-probe range in different ways, allowing for a separation in data
analyses. The high eccentricity would help in reducing the impact of the
non-gravitational perturbations whose impact would certainly be severe when
LETSGO would approach the Sun at just a few solar radii. Further studies should
be devoted to investigate both the consequences of the non-conservative forces
and the actual measurability of the effects of interest by means of extensive
numerical data simulations, parameter estimations and covariance analyses. Also
an alternative, fly-by configuration is worth of consideration.

late-time (>100 days) infrared (IR) emission from warm dust more than other
types of core-collapse SNe. Mid-IR observations, which span the peak of the
thermal spectral energy distribution, provide useful constraints on the
properties of the dust and, ultimately, the circumstellar environment,
explosion mechanism, and progenitor system. Due to the low SN IIn rate (<10% of
all core-collapse SNe), few IR observations exist for this subclass. The
handful of isolated studies, however, show late-time IR emission from warm dust
that, in some cases, extends for five or six years post-discovery. While
previous Spitzer/IRAC surveys have searched for dust in SNe, none have targeted
the Type IIn subclass. This article presents results from a warm Spitzer/IRAC
survey of the positions of all 68 known SNe IIn within a distance of 250 Mpc
between 1999 and 2008 that have remained unobserved by Spitzer more than 100
days post-discovery. The detection of late-time emission from ten targets
(~15%) nearly doubles the database of existing mid-IR observations of SNe IIn.
Although optical spectra show evidence for new dust formation in some cases,
the data show that in most cases the likely origin of the mid-IR emission is
pre-existing dust, which is continuously heated by optical emission generated
by ongoing circumstellar interaction between the forward shock and
circumstellar medium. Furthermore, an emerging trend suggests that these SNe
decline at ~1000--2000 days post-discovery once the forward shock overruns the
dust shell. The mass-loss rates associated with these dust shells are
consistent with luminous blue variable (LBV) progenitors.

a scenario where the inflaton is the relative position of two 7-branes on

inter-brane potential. The latter is sufficiently flat in the supergravity
regime of large volume moduli. Thus, in contrast to brane-antibrane inflation,
fluxbrane inflation does not require warping. We calculate the inflaton
potential both in the supergravity approximation and via an open-string
one-loop computation on toroidal backgrounds. This leads us to propose a
generalisation to genuine Calabi-Yau manifolds. We also comment on competing
F-term effects. The end of inflation is marked by the condensation of tachyonic
recombination fields between the 7-branes, triggering the formation of a bound
state described as a stable extension along the 7-brane divisor. Hence our
model fits in the framework of hybrid D-term inflation. We work out the main

(2010)] has proposed a remarkable spin model for (CuCl)LaNb2O7, in which dimers
are ferromagnetically coupled to each other on the distorted Shastry-Sutherland
lattice. In this model, the intra-dimer exchange coupling J>0 is
antiferromagnetic, while the inter-dimer exchange couplings are ferromagnetic
and take different values, J_x,J_y<0, in the two bond directions. Anticipating
that the highly frustrated character of this model may lead to a wide range of
behaviors in (CuCl)LaNb2O7 and related compounds, we theoretically investigate
the ground state phase diagram of this model in detail using the following
three approaches: a strong-coupling expansion for small J_x and J_y, exact
diagonalization for finite clusters, and a Schwinger boson mean field theory.
When |J_x|, |J_y| <~ J, the system stays in a dimer singlet phase with a finite
spin gap. This state is adiabatically connected to the decoupled-dimer limit
J_x=J_y=0. We show that the magnetization process of this phase depends
crucially on the spatial anisotropy of the inter-dimer couplings. The
magnetization shows a jump or a smooth increase for weak and strong anisotropy,
respectively, after the spin gap closes at a certain magnetic field. When |J_x|
or |J_y| >~ J, quantum phase transitions to various magnetically ordered phases
(ferromagnetic, collinear stripe, and spiral) occur. The Schwinger boson
analysis demonstrates that quantum fluctuations split the classical degeneracy
of different spiral ground states. Implications for (CuCl)LaNb2O7 and related

Heisenberg model as an example, we use quasiclassical methods to determine the
impurity contributions to the magnetization and susceptibility. Most
importantly, each impurity moment is not quantized, but receives non-universal
screening corrections due to local relief of frustration. At finite
temperatures, where bulk long-range order is absent, this implies an
impurity-induced magnetic response of Curie form, with a prefactor
corresponding to a fractional moment per impurity. We also discuss the behavior
in an applied magnetic field, where we find a singular linear-response limit
for overcompensated impurities, and propose experiments to test our theory.

at z = 1-3. Since each method suffers from selection biases, we have applied
three leading techniques (Lyman break, BX/BM, and BzK selection) simultaneously
in the Subaru Deep Field. This field has reliable ({\Delta}z/(1 + z) =
0.02--0.09) photometric redshifts for ~53,000 galaxies from 20 bands
(1500{\AA}--2.2{\mu}m). The BzK, LBG, and BX/BM samples suffer contamination
from z<1 interlopers of 6%, 8%, and 20%, respectively. Around the redshifts
where it is most sensitive (z~1.9 for star-forming BzK, z~1.8 for z~2 LBGs,
z~1.6 for BM, and z~2.3 for BX), each technique finds 60-80% of the census of
the three methods. In addition, each of the color techniques shares 75-96% of
its galaxies with another method, which is consistent with previous studies
that adopt identical criteria on magnitudes and colors. Combining the three
samples gives a comprehensive census that includes ~90% of z-phot = 1-3
galaxies, using standard magnitude limits similar to previous studies. In fact,
we find that among z = 1-2.5 galaxies in the color selection census, 81-90% of
them can be selected by just combining the BzK selection with one of the UV
techniques (z~2 LBG or BX and BM). The average galaxy stellar mass, reddening
and SFRs all decrease systematically from the sBzK population to the LBGs, and
to the BX/BMs. The combined color selections yield a total cosmic SFR density
of 0.18 $\pm$ 0.03 M_sun yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} for K_AB <= 24. We find that 65% of
the star formation is in galaxies with E(B-V) > 0.25 mag, even though they are
only one-fourth of the census by number.

of the steep-spectrum radio luminosity function, with the aim of quantifying
the high-redshift cut-off suggested by previous work. To achieve this, the
Combined EIS-NVSS Survey of Radio Sources (CENSORS) has been developed; this is
a 1.4 GHz radio survey, containing 135 sources complete to a flux density of
7.2 mJy, selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) over 6 deg^2 of the ESO
Imaging Survey (EIS) Patch D. The sample is currently 73% spectroscopically
complete, with the remaining redshifts estimated via the K-z or I-z
magnitude-redshift relation. CENSORS is combined with additional radio data
from the Parkes All-Sky, Parkes Selected Regions, Hercules and VLA COSMOS
samples to provide comprehensive coverage of the radio power vs. redshift
plane. The redshift distributions of these samples, together with radio source
count determinations, and measurements of the local luminosity function,
provide the input to the fitting process. The modelling reveals clear declines,
at > 3sigma significance, in comoving density at z > 0.7 for lower luminosity
sources (log P = 25-26); these turnovers are still present at log P > 27, but
move to z > 3, suggesting a luminosity-dependent evolution of the redshift
turnover, similar to the `cosmic downsizing' seen for other AGN populations.
These results are shown to be robust to the estimated redshift errors and to
increases in the spectral index for the highest redshift sources. Analytic fits
to the best-fitting steep spectrum grid are provided so that the results
presented here can be easily accessed by the reader, as well as allowing
plausible extrapolations outside of the regions covered by the input datasets

the other Seyfert galaxies. Indeed, they are thought to be accreting at
Eddington rates and to possess low mass black holes. Therefore, they may
represent a key class of objects for understanding the co-evolution of black
holes and their host galaxies. We propose that NLS1s represent a class of AGN
in which the black hole growth is, and has always been, dominated by secular
evolution. Firstly, by looking at the NLS1 host galaxy properties in the
literature, we show that the evolution of NLS1s is presently driven by secular
processes, much more so than for Broad-Line Seyfert 1s (BLS1s). Secondly, we
study the bulges of NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies. Our results demonstrate that NLS1
host bulges are pseudo-bulges and are statistically different from BLS1 bulges.
This difference points to the particular importance of secular processes in the
past evolution of their hosts. We build on this result to understand the
implications on their evolution and the duration of their duty cycle. We show
that NLS1s are not necessarily in a special phase of black hole growth and that
several Gyr are required for their black hole masses to become similar to
BLS1s. Finally, in the light of our results, we discuss the location of NLS1
galaxies on the MBH-\sigma plane and speculate about the connection between the
NLS1 galaxy properties and their black hole spin.

The
multiple edge insertion problem (MEI) asks for a drawing of G+F with the
minimum number of pairwise edge crossings, such that the subdrawing of G is
plane. Finding an exact solution to MEI is NP-hard for general F. We present
the first polynomial time algorithm for MEI that achieves an additive
approximation guarantee -- depending only on the size of F and the maximum
degree of G, in the case of connected G. Our algorithm seems to be the first
directly implementable one in that realm, too, next to the single edge
insertion. It is also known that an (even approximate) solution to the MEI
problem would approximate the crossing number of the F-almost-planar graph G+F,
while computing the crossing number of G+F exactly is NP-hard already when
|F|=1. Hence our algorithm induces new, improved approximation bounds for the
crossing number problem of F-almost-planar graphs, achieving constant-factor
approximation for the large class of such graphs of bounded degrees and bounded
size of F.

We generate initial conditions for the Angus (2009) cosmological model, which
is identical to LCDM except that the cold dark matter is switched for a single
species of thermal sterile neutrinos. We set the initial conditions at z=250
for a (512 Mpc/h)^3 box with 256^3 particles and we evolve them down to z=0. We
clearly demonstrate the necessity of MOND for developing the large scale
structure in a hot dark matter cosmology and contradict the naive expectation
that MOND cannot form galaxy clusters. We find that the correct order of
magnitude of X-ray clusters (with T_X > 4.5 keV) can be formed, but that we
overpredict the number of very rich clusters and seriously underpredict the
number of lower mass clusters. The latter is a shortcoming of the resolution of
our simulations, whereas we suggest that the over production of very rich
clusters might be prevented by incorporating a MOND acceleration constant that
varies with redshift and an expansion history that cannot be described by the
usual Friedmann models. We present evidence that suggests the density profiles
of our simulated clusters are compatible with those of observed X-ray clusters
in MOND. It remains to be seen if the low mass end of the cluster mass function
can be reproduced and if the high densities of dark matter in the central 20
kpc of groups and clusters of galaxies, measured in the MOND framework, can be
achieved. As a last test, we computed the relative velocity between pairs of
halos within 10 Mpc and find that pairs with velocities larger than 3000 km/s
like the bullet cluster, can form without difficulty.

standard cold dark matter model, we examine global trends in the evolution of
galaxies due to gravitational shock heating by collapse of large halos and
large-scale structure. We find two major global trends. (1) The mean specific
star formation rate (sSFR) at a given galaxy mass is a monotonically increasing
function with increasing redshift. (2) The mean sSFR at a given redshift is a
monotonically increasing function of decreasing galaxy mass that steepens with
decreasing redshift. The general dimming trend with time merely reflects the
general decline of gas inflow rate with increasing time. The differential
evolution of galaxies of different masses with redshift is a result of
gravitational shock heating of gas due to formation of large halos (groups and
clusters) and large-scale structure that move a progressively larger fraction
of galaxies and their satellites into environments where gas has too high an
entropy to cool to continue feeding resident galaxies. Overdense regions where
larger halos are preferentially located begin to be heated earlier and have
higher temperatures than lower density regions at any given time, causing sSFR
of larger galaxies to fall below the general dimming trend at higher redshift
than less massive galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR to gradually shift to
lower density environments at lower redshift. We find that several noted cosmic
downsizing phenomena are different manifestations of these general trends. We
also find that the great migration of galaxies from blue cloud to red sequence
as well as color-density relation, among others, may arise naturally in this
picture.

paper, we discuss the sensitivities and outlooks of detection of GWs from
binary massive black holes in these frequency bands with an emphasis on
ASTROD-GW. The GWs generated by the inspirals, merging and subsequent ringdowns

Extreme-Mass-Ratio Black Hole Inspirals (EMRI), and using these observations to

arbitrary two-qubit states, and the necessary conditions for a state achieving
them, are obtained. For the three-qubit system, we study the speed for pure
states, whose entanglement properties can be completely described by five
local-unitary-transformation invariants. An analytical expression of the
relation between the speed and the invariants is derived. The speed is enhanced
by the the three-tangle which is the entanglement among the three qubits, but
reduced by the the two-qubit correlations outside of the concurrence. The decay
of the negativity can be restrained by the other two negativity with the
coequal sense. The unbalance between two qubits can reduce speed of
disentanglement of the remaining qubit in the system, even can retrieve the
entanglement partially. For the k-qubit systems in an arbitrary superposition
of GHZ state and W state, the speed depends almost entirely on the amount of
the negativity when k increases to five or six. An alternative quantitative
definition for the robustness of entanglement is presented based on the speed
of disentanglement, with comparison to the widely studied robustness measured
by the critical amount of noise parameter where the entanglement vanishes. In
the limit of large number of particles, the alternative robustness of the
GHZ-type states is inversely proportional to k, and the one of the W states
approaches 1/\sqrt{k}.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In experimenting with off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods in
hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) systems, we have observed unwanted
on-policy learning under reproducible conditions. Here we present modifications
to several TD methods that prevent unintentional on-policy learning from
occurring. These modifications create a tension between exploration and
learning. Traditional TD methods require commitment to finishing subtasks
without exploration in order to update Q-values for early actions with high
probability. One-step intra-option learning and temporal second difference
traces (TSDT) do not suffer from this limitation. We demonstrate that our HRL
system is efficient without commitment to completion of subtasks in a
cliff-walking domain, contrary to a widespread claim in the literature that it
is critical for efficiency of learning. Furthermore, decreasing commitment as
exploration progresses is shown to improve both online performance and the
resultant policy in the taxicab domain, opening a new avenue for research into
when it is more beneficial to continue with the current subtask or to replan.

ultrafast decay of their magnetic fields from their initial values to their
current surface values. If the electromagnetic energy radiated during this
field decay is converted into kinetic and rotational energies of the neutron
star then the decay time is of the order of 10^(-4) s provided that the initial
magnetic fields lie in the range of 10^(15)-10^(16) G and the initial periods
in the range 1-20 ms. This means that all neutron stars are born with magnetic
fields typical of magnetars and periods typical of millisecond pulsars. More
explicitly, energy considerations and a birth-ultrafast-magnetic-field decay
imply a model that consistently relates birth properties of neutron stars such
as the initial period and the initial magnetic field with current properties
such as the observed period, the surface magnetic field and the transverse
velocity. This model provides a solution to the long-standing problem of
finding a physical explanation for the observed high velocities of neutron
stars. These stars acquire their space velocities during the birth ultrafast
decay of their magnetic fields. The origin of this field decay points to
magnetic instabilities, which are inevitable if neutron stars are born as
magnetars.

adversarial scenario where adversary at every time step picks the worst

neither of these assumptions are reasonable. It is therefore important to study
problems with a range of assumptions on data. Unfortunately, theoretical
results in this area are scarce, possibly due to absence of general tools for
analysis. Focusing on the regret formulation, we define the minimax value of a
game where the adversary is restricted in his moves. The framework captures
stochastic and non-stochastic assumptions on data. Building on the sequential
symmetrization approach, we define a notion of distribution-dependent
Rademacher complexity for the spectrum of problems ranging from i.i.d. to
worst-case. The bounds let us immediately deduce variation-type bounds. We then
consider the i.i.d. adversary and show equivalence of online and batch

complementarity of the two remaining methods (Pad\'{e} and conformal mapping)
to illustrate their respective advantages and limitations. We emphasize the
importance of the existence of solutions with movable singularities for the
efficiency of the methods, particularly for the so-called Pad\'{e}-Hankel
method. (We show that this latter method is equivalent to pushing a movable
pole to infinity.) For each configuration, we determine the singularity
distribution (in the complex plane of the independent variable) of the solution
sought and show how this distribution controls the efficiency of the two
methods. In general the method based on Pad\'{e} approximants is easy to use
and robust but may be awkward in some circumstances whereas the conformal
mapping method is a very fine method which should be used when high accuracy is
required.

hole is a harmful stationary process residing in a node of the network and
destroying destroys all mobile agents visiting that node without leaving any

and initially scattered within the network. Moreover, we solve the problem with
agents that have constant-sized memory and carry a constant number of identical

known solutions for the case of scattered agents searching for a black hole,
use stronger models where the agents have non-constant memory, can write
messages in whiteboards located at nodes or are allowed to mark both the edges

networks containing a single black hole. We are interested in the minimum

topologies and provide matching lower and upper bounds for the number of agents

thickness effects (i.e. non-flatness) can be easily accounted for by
implementing an appropriate ""softening length"" $\lambda$. The solution of this
""softened ODE"" has the following properties: i) it is regular at the edges
(finite radial accelerations), ii) it possesses the correct long-range
properties, iii) it matches the Newtonian potential of a geometrically thin
disk very well, and iv) it tends continuously to the flat disk solution in the
limit $\lambda \rightarrow 0$. As illustrated by many examples, the ODE,
subject to exact Dirichlet conditions, can be solved numerically with
efficiency for any given colatitude at second-order from center to infinity
using radial mapping. This approach is therefore particularly well-suited to
generating grids of gravitational forces in order to study particles moving
under the field of a gravitating disk as found in various contexts (active

yield intermittent polarity flip of the dipole moment. This model can also
describe the synchronization of the spin oscillation. This corresponds to the
case of sun and the model well describes the quasi-regular cycles of the solar

OGLE-2005-BLG-018. The light curve of the event is characterized by 2 adjacent
strong features and a single weak feature separated from the strong features.
The light curve exhibits noticeable deviations from the best-fit model based on
standard binary parameters. To explain the deviation, we test models including
various higher-order effects of the motions of the observer, source, and lens.
From this, we find that it is necessary to account for the orbital motion of
the lens in describing the light curve. From modeling of the light curve
considering the parallax effect and Keplerian orbital motion, we are able to
measure not only the physical parameters but also a complete orbital solution
of the lens system. It is found that the event was produced by a binary lens
located in the Galactic bulge with a distance $6.7\pm 0.3$ kpc from the Earth.
The individual lens components with masses $0.9\pm 0.3\ M_\odot$ and $0.5\pm
0.1\ M_\odot$ are separated with a semi-major axis of $a=2.5 \pm 1.0$ AU and
orbiting each other with a period $P=3.1 \pm 1.3$ yr. The event demonstrates
that it is possible to extract detailed information about binary lens systems
from well-resolved lensing light curves.

monoclinic $P2_{1}$ symmetry, with layered ordering of the Na and La ions and
rocksalt ordering of Mn and W ions. The Mn atoms show an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) collinear spin ordering, and the compound has been reported as a
potential multiferroic. By comparing the low symmetry structure with a parent
phase of $P4/nmm$ symmetry, two distortion modes are found dominant. They
correspond to MnO$_{6}$ and WO$_{6}$ octahedron \textit{tilt} modes, often
found in many simple perovskites. While in the latter these common tilting
instabilities yield non-polar phases, in NaLaMnWO$_{6}$ the additional presence
of the $A$-$A^{'}$ cation ordering is sufficient to make these rigid unit modes
as a source of the ferroelectricity. Through a trilinear coupling with the two
unstable tilting modes, a significant polar distortion is induced, although the
system has no intrinsic polar instability. The calculated electric polarization
resulting from this polar distortion is as large as $\sim$ 16 ${\mu}{\rm
C/cm^{2}}$. Despite its secondary character, this polarization is coupled with
the dominant tilting modes and its switching is bound to produce the switching
of one of two tilts, enhancing in this way a possible interaction with the
magnetic ordering. The transformation of common non-polar purely steric
instabilities into sources of ferroelectricity through a controlled
modification of the parent structure, as done here by the cation ordering, is a
phenomenon to be further explored.

by circumstellar disks which they interact with through accretion of mass. The
accretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed to power
the mass outflows, which may in turn remove the excess angular momentum from
the star-disk system. However, although the process of mass accretion is a
critical aspect of star formation, some of its mechanisms are still to be fully
understood. A point not considered to date and relevant for the accretion
process is the evidence of very energetic and frequent flaring events in these
stars. Flares may easily perturb the stability of the disks, thus influencing
the transport of mass and angular momentum. Here we report on three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic modeling of the evolution of a flare with an idealized
non--equilibrium initial condition occurring near the disk around a rotating
magnetized star. The model takes into account the stellar magnetic field, the
gravitational force, the viscosity of the disk, the magnetic-field-oriented
thermal conduction (including the effects of heat flux saturation), the
radiative losses from optically thin plasma, and the coronal heating. We show
that, during its first stage of evolution, the flare gives rise to a hot
magnetic loop linking the disk to the star. The disk is strongly perturbed by
the flare: disk material evaporates under the effect of the thermal conduction
and an overpressure wave propagates through the disk. When the overpressure
reaches the opposite side of the disk, a funnel flow starts to develop there,
accreting substantial disk material onto the young star from the side of the
disk opposite to the flare.

stochastic, seasonally forced, well-mixed models of infection based on
susceptible-infective-recovered dynamics in a closed population. These models
reflect different assumptions about the immune response of naive hosts, namely
total permanent immunity, immunity waning, immunity waning together with
immunity boosting, reinfection of recovered, and repeat infection after partial
immunity waning. The power spectra of the output prevalence time series
characterize the long term dynamics of the models. For epidemiological
parameters consistent with published data for pertussis, the power spectra show
quantitative and even qualitative differences that can be used to test their
assumptions by comparison with ensembles of several decades long
pre-vaccination data records. We illustrate this strategy on two publicly

simulations of the standard LCDM cosmology. The results presented in this paper
are based on 4 large N-body simulations with about 10 billion particles each:
the Millennium-I and II, Bolshoi, and MultiDark simulations. The MultiDark (or
BigBolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations
with high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with
unprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about
six orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state-of-the-art of our
current knowledge on this basic property of dark matter halos in the LCDM
cosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation
data sets. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high
redshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration
c(M,z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological
parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms
of the linear rms fluctuation of the density field sigma(M,z), the halo
concentration c(sigma) shows a nearly-universal simple U-shaped behaviour with
a minimum at a well defined scale at sigma=0.71. Yet, some small dependences
with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end (sigma < 1) the
median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly
radial orbits. This c-sigma(M,z) relation can be accurately parametrized and
provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass.
When applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are
substantially larger -- by a factor up to 1.5 -- than previous results from
smaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of
observations. (abridged)

traffic offload and in the improvement of both capacity and coverage networks.
The operators are interested in solving their localized coverage and capacity
problems in areas where the macro network signal is not able to serve the

solution at reasonable expanses. The femto cell seems to be the answer to this
problematic. In this work (This work is supported by the COMET project AWARE.
http://www.ftw.at/news/project-start-for-aware-ftw), we focus on the problem of
sharing femto access between a same mobile operator's customers. This problem
can be modeled as a game where service requesters customers (SRCs) and service
providers customers (SPCs) are the players.
  This work addresses the sharing femto access problem considering only one SPC
using game theory tools. We consider that SRCs are static and have some similar
and regular connection behavior. We also note that the SPC and each SRC have a
software embedded respectively on its femto access, user equipment (UE).
  After each connection requested by a SRC, its software will learn the
strategy increasing its gain knowing that no information about the other SRCs
strategies is given. The following article presents a distributed learning
algorithm with incomplete information running in SRCs software. We will then
answer the following questions for a game with $N$ SRCs and one SPC: how many
connections are necessary for each SRC in order to learn the strategy
maximizing its gain? Does this algorithm converge to a stable state? If yes,
does this state a Nash Equilibrium and is there any way to optimize the
learning process duration time triggered by SRCs software?

mission goals and to help lay out a series of constraints on the experiment's
possible progress. In the rotation experiment pairs of images of identical
surface regions taken at different epochs are used to retrieve information on
Mercury's rotation and orientation. The idea is that from observations of the
same patch of Mercury's surface at two different solar longitudes of Mercury
the orientation of Mercury can be determined, and therefore also the obliquity
and rotation variations with respect to the uniform rotation. The estimation of
the libration amplitude and obliquity through pattern matching of observed
surface landmarks is challenging. The main problem arises from the difficulty
to observe the same landmark on the planetary surface repeatedly over the MPO
mission lifetime, due to the combination of Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance,
the absence of a drift of the MPO polar orbital plane and the need to combine
data from different instruments with their own measurement restrictions. By
assuming that Mercury occupies a Cassini state and that the spacecraft operates
nominally we show that under worst case assumptions the annual libration
amplitude and obliquity can be measured with a precision of respectively 1.4
arcseconds (as) and 1.0 as over the nominal BepiColombo MPO lifetime with about
25 landmarks for rather stringent illumination restrictions. The outcome of the

for the case of a 1D extended Hubbard model. We show that block symmetry
provides an intuitive understanding of the spectral double degeneracy of the
Haldane-insulator, revealing as well partial double degeneracy for the
Mott-insulator. Moreover, surprisingly, the partition dependence of the
spectral degeneracy in the Haldane- and Mott-insulator is directly linked to
the, in principle unrelated, density-density correlations, and presents an
intriguing periodic behavior in superfluid and supersolid phases.

number of hard jets, leptons and photons. To obtain an exclusive N-jet sample,
one can measure the event shape ""N-jettiness"" \tau_N and veto additional
undesired jets by requiring \tau_N <<1. However, this leads to large logarithms
of \tau_N in the cross section, that need to be summed for reliable theory
predictions. For N=0 in hadronic collisions, \tau_N reduces to the ""beam
thrust"" eventshape \tau_B. We derive a factorization theorem for pp -> XL,
where a central jet veto \tau_B<<1 is imposed on the hadronic final state X and
L is non-hadronic. This factorization theorem enables us to sum large
logarithms of \tau_B in the cross section. The initial state is described by
""beam functions"", which depend on the momentum fraction x and the (transverse)
virtuality t of the colliding partons. The dependence on t can be calculated in
perturbation theory by matching beam functions onto the parton distribution
functions (PDFs) at the intermediate scale \mu_B^2 ~ t, and we have calculated
all one-loop matching coefficients. Unlike the PDFs, the evolution of the beam
function is in t and does not affect x or the parton type. We show results for
the beam thrust cross section for Drell-Yan and Higgs production through gluon
fusion at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic order. For N>0, we obtain a
factorization formula with inclusive jet and beam functions that allows us to
sum the large logarithms of \tau_N.

approach allows the introduction of the notion of mass as a local deformation
of space regarded as a tessellation lattice of founding elements, topological
balls, whose size is estimated as the Planck one. The interaction of a moving
particle-like deformation with the surrounding lattice of space involves a
fractal decomposition process that supports the existence and properties of
previously postulated inerton clouds as associated to particles. The cloud of
inertons surrounding the particle spreads out to a range \Lambda = \lambda c /
v from the particle where v and c are velocities of the particle and light,
respectively, and \lambda is the de Broglie wavelength of the particle. Thus
the particle's inertons return the real sense to the wave \psi-function as the
field of inertia of the moving particle. Since inertons transfer fragments of
the particle mass, they play also the role of carriers of gravitational
properties of the particle. The submicroscopic concept has been verified
experimentally, though so far in microscopic and intermediate ranges.
