Lambda(1405) resonance is generated by the attractive interaction of the
antikaon and the nucleon, as a quasi-bound state below the threshold decaying
into the pi Sigma channel. Thus, the structure of Lambda(1405) is closely
related to the Kbar N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study
few-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic
properties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical
coupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity
of the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Lambda(1405)
resonance is dominated by the meson-baryon molecule component and is described
as a superposition of two independent states. The meson-baryon nature of
Lambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with
strangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic
interactions. We summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the
Lambda(1405) structure and future perspective of the physics of the

electron gases (2DEG) subject to a magnetic field and a strong dc current. In a
recent work we presented a model to describe the nonlinear transport regime of
this phenomenon. From the analysis of the differential resistivity and the
longitudinal voltage we predicted the formation of negative differential
resistivity states, although these states are known to be unstable. Based on
our model, we derive an analytical approximated expression for the
Voltage-Current characteristics, that captures the main elements of the
problem. The result allow us to construct an energy functional for the system.
In the zero temperature limit, the system presents a quantum phase transition,
with the control parameter given by the magnetic field. It is noted that above
a threshold value ($B>B_{th}$), the symmetry is spontaneously broken. At
sufficiently high magnetic field and low temperature the model predicts a phase
with a non-vanishing permanent current; this is a novel phase that has not been

nucleus formed in a region of the solar nebula that was depleted in CO or too
warm to retain much CO ice, repeated passages through the inner solar system
have substantially depleted the comet's primordial CO reservoir, or any CO

an apparent double helix, extending from HST-1 to knot A. Proper motions within
the jet suggest a decelerating jet flow passing through a slower, accelerating
wave pattern. We use these observations to develop a mass and energy flux
conserving model describing the jet flow and conditions along the jet. We
determine the cocoon conditions required if the twisted filaments are the
result of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) unstable elliptical mode. We find that the
cocoon must be cooler than the jet at HST-1 but must be about as hot as the jet
at knot A. Under these conditions we find that the observed filament wavelength
is near the elliptical mode maximum growth rate and growth is rapid enough for
the filaments to develop and saturate well before HST-1. We generate a
pseudo-synchrotron image of a model jet carrying a combination of normal modes
of the KH instability. The pseudo-synchrotron image of the jet reveals: (1)
that a slow decline in the model jet's surface brightness is still about five
times faster than the real jet; (2) that KH produced dual helically twisted
filaments can appear qualitatively similar to those on the real jet if any
helical perturbation to the jet is very small or nonexistent inside knot A; (3)
that the knots in the real jet cannot be associated with the twisted
filamentary features and are unlikely to be the result of a KH instability. The
existence of the knots in the real jet, the limb brightening of the real jet in
the radio, and the slower decline of the surface brightness of the real jet
indicate that additional processes --- such as unsteady jet flow and internal
particle acceleration --- are occurring within the jet. Disruption of the real
jet beyond knot A by KH instability is consistent with the jet and cocoon
conditions we find at knot A.

K-alpha emission line, generally interpreted to originate very close to the
central black hole which must then have a high spin. The observed X-ray
variability is driven by a powerlaw component, with little variability found in
the iron line energy band. The disconnection of continuum and line variability
may be a consequence of strong gravitational light bending. The X-ray spectrum
of MCG-6-30-15 is however complex, strongly modified at soft X-ray energies by
warm absorbers, which some workers have extended to build an
absorption-dominated model of the whole source behaviour. The absorption model
interprets the whole X-ray spectrum without a relativistic reflection component
and attributes most variability to the warm absorbers. We re-examine the
XMM-Newton, Chandra and Suzaku data taken in 2001, 2004 and 2006, respectively,
and construct a model consisting of several warm absorbers confirmed by
spectral analysis, together with a relativistically blurred reflection
component that explains both the soft and hard excesses as well. The model
works well on data from all epochs, demonstrating that the reflection model
provides a consistent interpretation of the broadband spectrum of MCG-6-30-15.

molecular clouds in the Galactic center (GC). We assume that at present the
total flux of this emission consists of time variable component generated by
primary X-ray photons ejected by Sagittarius A$^\ast$ (Sgr A$^\ast$) in the
past and a relatively weak quasi-stationary component excited by impact of
protons which were generated by star accretion onto the central black hole. The
level of background emission was estimated from a rise of the 6.4 keV line
intensity in the direction of several molecular clouds, that we interpreted as
a stage when the X-ray front ejected by Sgr A$^\ast$ entered into these clouds.
The 6.4 keV emission before this intensity jump we interpreted as emission
generated by subrelativistic cosmic rays there. The cross-section of K$\alpha$
vacancies produced by protons differs from that of electrons or X-rays.
Therefore, we expect that this processes can be distinguished from the analysis
of the equivalent width of the iron line and time variations of the width can
be predicted. The line intensity from the clouds depends on their distance from
Sgr A$^\ast$ and the coefficient of spacial diffusion near the Galactic center.
We expect that in a few years the line intensity for the cloud G\,0.11$-$0.11
which is relatively close to Sgr A$^\ast$ will decreases to the level
$\lesssim$ 10% from its present value. For the cloud Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2)
the situation is more intricate. If the diffusion coefficient $D\gtrsim
10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ then the expected stationary flux should be about 10%
of its level in 2000. In the opposite case the line intensity from Sgr B2
should drop down to zero because the protons do not reach the cloud.

is a constructive algorithm to solve this equation, and is simple to implement
when the solution is a stable fixed point, the only complication being that
Ricci solitons may exist which are not Einstein. Here we extend previous work
to consider the Einstein-DeTurck equation for Riemannian manifolds with
boundaries, and those that continue to static Lorentzian spacetimes which are
asymptotically flat, Kaluza-Klein, locally AdS or have extremal horizons. Using
a maximum principle we prove that Ricci solitons do not exist in these cases
and so any solution is Einstein. We also argue that Ricci-DeTurck flow
preserves these classes of manifolds. As an example we simulate Ricci-DeTurck
flow for a manifold with asymptotics relevant for AdS_5/CFT_4. Our maximum
principle dictates there are no soliton solutions, and we give strong numerical
evidence that there exists a stable fixed point of the flow which continues to
a smooth static Lorentzian Einstein metric. Our asymptotics are such that this

field of the NGC346 cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, using a novel
self-consistent method that allows us to reliably identify pre-main sequence
(PMS) objects actively undergoing mass accretion, regardless of their age. The
method does not require spectroscopy and combines broad-band V and I photometry
with narrow-band Halpha imaging to identify all stars with excess Halpha
emission and derive the accretion luminosity Lacc and mass accretion rate Macc
for all of them. The application of this method to existing HST/ACS photometry
of the NGC346 field has allowed us to identify and study 680 bona-fide PMS
stars with masses from ~0.4 to ~4 Msolar and ages in the range from ~1 to ~30
Myr. This is the first study to reveal that, besides a young population of PMS
stars (~ 1 Myr old), in this field there is also an older population of PMS
objects with a median age of ~20 Myr. We provide for all of them accurate
physical parameters. We study the evolution of the mass accretion rate as a
function of stellar parameters and find that logMacc ~ -0.6 Log t + Log m + c,
where t is the age of the star, m its mass and c a quantity that is higher at
lower metallicity. The high mass accretion rates that we find suggest that a
considerable fraction of the stellar mass is accreted during the PMS phase and
that PMS evolutionary models that do not account for this effect will
systematically underestimate the true age when compared with the observations.

it generates microwaves components at the harmonics of the repetition rate

pulse train) is known to be dependent on the optical energy per pulse. We
present an experimental study of this dependence in InGaAs pin photo-diodes
illuminated with ultra-short pulses generated by an Erbium-doped fiber based
femtosecond laser. The energy to phase dependence is measured over a large
range of impinging pulse energies near and above saturation for two typical
detectors, commonly used in optical frequency metrology with femtosecond laser
based optical frequency combs. When scanning the optical pulse energy, the
coefficient which relates phase variations to energy variations is found to
alternate between positive and negative values, with many (for high harmonics
of the repetition rate) vanishing points. By operating the system near one of
these vanishing points, the typical amplitude noise level of commercial-core
fiber-based femtosecond lasers is sufficiently low to generate state-of-the-art
ultra-low phase noise microwave signals, virtually immune to amplitude to phase

discuss the possibility that the high surface brightnesses observed are not due
to star formation, but due to cosmological gas accretion. We assume that all of
the accretion energy is dissipated as shocks from the accreting gas. We show
that in order to explain the high surface brightnesses both the mass accretion
rate and energy would have to be much higher than expected from simulations or
from equating the star formation with the accretion rate. We also investigate
scaling relations between the surface brightness expected from accretion and
for star formation through mechanical heating and photo-ionization, trying to
identify a regime where such accretion may become evident in galaxies.
Unfortunately, the surface brightness necessary to detect the gas in optical
line emission is about an order of magnitude lower than what has currently been
achieved with near-infrared observations of distant galaxies.

GALEX imaging allows us to detect XUV-disks beyond 100 Mpc. The XUV regions
around XUV-disk galaxies are consistently bluer than the main bodies. We find a
surprisingly high frequency of XUV emission around luminous red (NUV-r > 5) and
green valley (3 < NUV-r < 5) galaxies. The XUV-disk space density in the local

dimensions is that the Birkhoff invariant $\beta$ (the least maximal length of
any sweepout or foliation by circles) of an apparent horizon of energy $E$ and
area $A$ should satisfy $\beta \le 4 \pi E$. This conjecture together with the
Cosmic Censorship or Isoperimetric inequality implies that the length $\ell$ of
the shortest non-trivial closed geodesic satisfies $\ell^2 \le \pi A$. We have
tested these conjectures on the horizons of all four-charged rotating black
hole solutions of ungauged supergravity theories and find that they always
hold. They continue to hold in the the presence of a negative cosmological
constant, and for multi-charged rotating solutions in gauged supergravity.
Surprisingly, they also hold for the Ernst-Wild static black holes immersed in
a magnetic field, which are asymptotic to the Melvin solution. In five
spacetime dimensions we define $\beta$ as the least maximal area of all
sweepouts of the horizon by two-dimensional tori, and find in all cases
examined that $ \beta(g) \le \frac{16 \pi}{3} E$, which we conjecture holds
quiet generally for apparent horizons. In even spacetime dimensions $D=2N+2$,
we find that for sweepouts by the product $S^1 \times S^{D-4}$, $\beta$ is
bounded from above by a certain dimension-dependent multiple of the energy $E$.
We also find that $\ell^{D-2}$ is bounded from above by a certain
dimension-dependent multiple of the horizon area $A$. Finally, we show that
$\ell^{D-3}$ is bounded from above by a certain dimension-dependent multiple of

gene expression patterns. The study of their topology has revealed that certain
subgraphs of interactions or ""motifs"" appear at anomalously high frequencies.
We ask here whether this phenomenon may emerge because of the functions carried
out by these networks. Given a framework for describing regulatory interactions
and dynamics, we consider in the space of all regulatory networks those that
have a prescribed function. Monte Carlo sampling is then used to determine how
these functional networks lead to specific motif statistics in the
interactions. In the case where the regulatory networks are constrained to
exhibit multi-stability, we find a high frequency of gene pairs that are
mutually inhibitory and self-activating. In contrast, networks constrained to
have periodic gene expression patterns (mimicking for instance the cell cycle)
have a high frequency of bifan-like motifs involving four genes with at least
one activating and one inhibitory interaction.

K-means and probabilistic clustering, their clustering results are sensitive to
the presence of outliers in the data. Even a few outliers can compromise the
ability of these algorithms to identify meaningful hidden structures rendering
their outcome unreliable. This paper develops robust clustering algorithms that
not only aim to cluster the data, but also to identify the outliers. The novel
approaches rely on the infrequent presence of outliers in the data which
translates to sparsity in a judiciously chosen domain. Capitalizing on the
sparsity in the outlier domain, outlier-aware robust K-means and probabilistic
clustering approaches are proposed. Their novelty lies on identifying outliers
while effecting sparsity in the outlier domain through carefully chosen
regularization. A block coordinate descent approach is developed to obtain
iterative algorithms with convergence guarantees and small excess computational
complexity with respect to their non-robust counterparts. Kernelized versions
of the robust clustering algorithms are also developed to efficiently handle
high-dimensional data, identify nonlinearly separable clusters, or even cluster
objects that are not represented by vectors. Numerical tests on both synthetic
and real datasets validate the performance and applicability of the novel
algorithms.

upper and lower bounds on each eigenvalue of a sum of random self-adjoint
matrices. This machinery is used to derive eigenvalue analogues of the
classical Chernoff, Bennett, and Bernstein bounds.
  Two examples demonstrate the efficacy of the minimax Laplace transform. The
first concerns the effects of column sparsification on the spectrum of a matrix
with orthonormal rows. Here, the behavior of the singular values can be
described in terms of coherence-like quantities. The second example addresses
the question of relative accuracy in the estimation of eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix of a random process. Standard results on the convergence of
sample covariance matrices provide bounds on the number of samples needed to
obtain relative accuracy in the spectral norm, but these results only guarantee
relative accuracy in the estimate of the maximum eigenvalue. The minimax
Laplace transform argument establishes that if the lowest eigenvalues decay
sufficiently fast, on the order of (K^2*r*log(p))/eps^2 samples, where K is the
condition number of an optimal rank-r approximation to C, are sufficient to
ensure that the dominant r eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a N(0, C)

and outputs as stochastic processes assuming values over finite alphabets
rather than in a Euclidean space. As control over networks becomes increasingly
common, data compression by reducing the size of the input and output alphabets
without losing the fidelity of representation becomes relevant. This requires
us to define a notion of distance between two stochastic processes assuming
values in distinct sets, possibly of different cardinalities. If the two
processes are i.i.d., then the problem becomes one of defining a metric between
two probability distributions over distinct finite sets of possibly different
cardinalities. This is the problem addressed in the present paper. A metric is
defined in terms of a joint distribution on the product of the two sets, which
has the two given distributions as its marginals, and has minimum entropy.
Computing the metric exactly turns out to be NP-hard. Therefore an efficient
greedy algorithm is presented for finding an upper bound on the distance. This
problem also turns out to be NP-hard, so again a greedy algorithm is
constructed for finding a suboptimal reduced order approximation. Taken
together, all the results presented here permit the approximation of an i.i.d.
process over a set of large cardinality by another i.i.d. process over a set of
smaller cardinality. In future work, attempts will be made to extend this work

a detailed parameter scan in a simplified GGMSB model recently employed by the
CMS collaboration to interpret their searches in the di-photon + $\etslash$
channel. Other observables like the effective mass distribution of the
di-photon + X events may also reveal the presence of new heavy particles beyond
the Higgs sector. The contamination of the h mass peak and simple remedies are
also discussed.

(SPD) preconditioners for linear systems with symmetric indefinite matrices.
The strategy, called absolute value preconditioning, is motivated by the
observation that the preconditioned minimal residual method with the inverse of
the absolute value of the matrix as a preconditioner converges to the exact
solution of the system in at most two steps. Neither the exact absolute value
of the matrix nor its exact inverse are computationally feasible to construct
in general. However, we provide a practical example of an SPD preconditioner
that is based on the suggested approach. In this example we consider a model
problem with a shifted discrete negative Laplacian, and suggest a geometric
multigrid (MG) preconditioner, where the inverse of the matrix absolute value
appears only on the coarse grid, while operations on finer grids are based on
the Laplacian. Our numerical tests demonstrate practical effectiveness of the
new MG preconditioner, which leads to a robust iterative scheme with minimalist
memory requirements.

fundamental problem in evolutionary biology and is frequently studied by the
framework of evolutionary game theory. A very powerful mechanism to promote
cooperation is network reciprocity, where the interaction patterns and
opportunities for strategy spread of agents are constrained to limited sets of
permanent interactions partners. Cooperation survives because it is possible
for close-knit communities of cooperation to be shielded from invasion by
defectors. Here we show that parameter ranges in which cooperation can survive
are strongly expanded if game play on networks is skewed towards more frequent
interactions with more successful neighbours. In particular, if agents
exclusively select neighbors for game play that are more successful than
themselves, cooperation can even dominate in situations in which it would die
out if interaction neighbours were chosen without a bias or with a preference
for less successful opponents. We demonstrate that the ""selecting fitter
neighbours"" strategy is evolutionarily stable. Moreover, it will emerge as the
dominant strategy out of an initially random population of agents.

masses, and a derived CMF. The main result is that projected blending of
initial cores causes derived cores to be too few and too massive. The number of
derived cores is fewer than the number of initial cores by a mean factor 1.4 in
sparse groups and 5 in crowded groups. The mass at the peak of the derived CMF
exceeds the mass at the peak of the initial CMF by a mean factor 1.0 in sparse

convection on the mean effective Lorentz force, and especially on the mean
effective magnetic pressure. Earlier studies with isotropically forced
non-stratified and stratified turbulence have shown that the contribution of
the turbulence to the mean magnetic pressure is negative for mean horizontal
magnetic fields that are smaller than the equipartition strength, so that the
effective mean magnetic pressure that takes into account the turbulence
effects, can be negative. Compared with earlier cases of forced turbulence with
an isothermal equation of state, we find that the turbulence effect is similar
to or even stronger in the present case of turbulent convection. This is argued
to be due to the anisotropy of turbulence in the vertical direction. Another
important difference compared with earlier studies is the presence of an
evolution equation for the specific entropy. Mean-field modelling with entropy
evolution indicates that the negative effective magnetic pressure can still
lead to a large-scale instability which forms local flux concentrations, even
though the specific entropy evolution tends to have a stabilizing effect when
applied to a stably stratified (e.g., isothermal) layer. It is argued that this
large-scale instability could be important for the formation of solar
large-scale magnetic structures such as active regions.

freely adjustable coupling constants and mass parameters, depending on the
symmetry algebra of the local gauge group and the representations chosen for
the spinor and scalar fields. There seems to be no physical principle to
determine these parameters as long as they stay within certain domains dictated
by the renormalization group. Here however, reasons are given to demand that,
when gravity is coupled to the system, local conformal invariance should be a
spontaneously broken exact symmetry. The argument has to do with the
requirement that black holes obey a complementarity principle relating ingoing
observers to outside observers, or equivalently, initial states to final
states. This condition fixes all parameters, including masses and the
cosmological constant. We suspect that only examples can be found where these
are all of order one in Planck units, but the values depend on the algebra
chosen. This paper combines findings reported in two previous preprints, and
puts these in a clearer perspective by shifting the emphasis towards the
implications for particle models.

13044. The present properties of the star imply that the star maintained a
substantial envelope mass of 0.3Mo, raising the question of how the planet
survived the common envelope before the envelope itself was lost? If such a
planet enters the envelope of an RGB star, it is expected to spiral-in to the
very inner region within <100yr, and be evaporated or destructed by the core.
We speculate that the planet was engulfed by the star as a result of the core
helium flash that caused this metal poor star to swell by a factor of ~3-4. The
evolution following the core helium flash is very rapid, and some of the
envelope is lost due to the interaction with the planet, and the rest of the
envelope shrinks within about a hundred years. This is about equal to the
spiraling-in time, and the planet survived.

a unique event, and compatible with special relativity and quantum mechanics:
the one in which the present of an observer at a point is identified with the
backward light cone of that point. However, this compatibility is achieved at
the cost of a renouncement to the notion of an objective, observer-independent
reality. We also argue that no non-trivial version of presentism survives in
general relativity, except if some mechanism forbids the existence of closed
timelike curves, in which case precisely one version of possibilism does
survive. We remark that the above physical theories force the
presentist/possibilist's view of reality to shrink and break up, whereas the
eternalist, on the contrary, is forced to grant the status of reality to more
and more entities. Finally, we identify mathematics as the ""deus ex machina""
allowing the eternalist to unify his vision of reality into a coherent whole,
and offer to him an ""idealist deal"": to accept a mathematical ontology in
exchange for the assurance of surviving any physical theory.

(transmission) power grid (2700 nodes and 3504 transmission lines). The cascade
is initiated by a sufficiently severe initial contingency tripping. It
propagates via sequential trippings of many more overheated lines, islanding
loads and generators and eventually arriving at a fixed point with the
surviving part of the system being power-flow-balanced and the rest of the
system being outaged. Utilizing an improved form of the quasi-static model for
cascade propagation introduced in our earlier study (Statistical Classification

severity of the cascade depends on the order of tripping overheated lines. Our
main observation is that the order of tripping has a tremendous effect on the
size of the resulting outage. Finding the ""best"" tripping, defined as causing
the least damage, constitutes a difficult dynamical optimization problem, whose
solution is most likely computationally infeasible. Instead, here we study
performance of a number of natural heuristics, resolving the next switching
decision based on the current state of the grid. Overall, we conclude that
controlled intentional tripping is advantageous in the situation of a fast
developing extreme emergency, as it provides significant mitigation of the
resulting damage.

turbulent motions and the detailed accretion flow pattern. We find that regions
within two scale heights of the midplane have a turbulent Mach number of about
0.1 and a magnetic pressure two to three orders of magnitude less than the gas
pressure, while outside three scale heights the magnetic pressure equals or
exceeds the gas pressure and the turbulence is transonic, leading to large
density fluctuations. The strongest large-scale density disturbances are spiral
density waves, and the strongest of these waves has m=5. No clear meridional
circulation appears in the calculations because fluctuating radial pressure
gradients lead to changes in the orbital frequency, comparable in importance to
the stress gradients that drive the meridional flows in viscous models. The net
mass flow rate is well-reproduced by a viscous model using the mean stress
distribution taken from the MHD calculation. The strength of the mean turbulent
magnetic field is inversely proportional to the radius, so the fields are
approximately force-free on the largest scales. Consequently the accretion
stress falls off as the inverse square of the radius.
