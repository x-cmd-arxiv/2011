symmetrically with respect to the Galactic plane. The bubbles have been
suggested to be in a quasi-steady state, inflated by ongoing star formation
over the age of the Galaxy. Here we propose an alternative picture where the
bubbles are the remnants of a large-scale wide-angle outflow from \sgra, the
SMBH of our Galaxy. Such an outflow would be a natural consequence of a short
but bright accretion event on to \sgra\ if it happened concurrently with the
well known star formation event in the inner 0.5 pc of the Milky Way $\sim 6$
Myr ago. We find that the hypothesised near-spherical outflow is focussed into
a pair of symmetrical lobes by the greater gas pressure along the Galactic
plane. The outflow shocks against the interstellar gas in the Galaxy bulge.
Gamma--ray emission could be powered by cosmic rays created by either \sgra\
directly or accelerated in the shocks with the external medium. The Galaxy disc
remains unaffected, agreeing with recent observational evidence that
supermassive black holes do not correlate with galaxy disc properties. We
estimate that an accreted mass $\sim 2 \times 10^3\msun$ is needed for the
accretion event to power the observed {\it Fermi}--LAT lobes. Within a factor
of a few this agrees with the mass of the young stars born during the star
formation event. This estimate suggests that roughly 50% of the gas was turned
into stars, while the rest accreted onto \sgra. One interpretation of this is a
reduced star formation efficiency inside the \sgra\ accretion disc due to
stellar feedback, and the other a peculiar mass deposition geometry that
resulted in a significant amount of gas falling directly inside the inner $\sim
0.03$ pc of the Galaxy.

cloud cores. The ionization fraction, in turn, controls the coupling of the
magnetic field to the gas and hence the dynamical evolution of the cores. The
purpose of this work is to compute the attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux rate
in a cloud core taking into account magnetic focusing, magnetic mirroring, and
all relevant energy loss processes. We adopt a standard cloud model
characterized by a mass-to-flux ratio supercritical by a factor of about 2 to
describe the density and magnetic field distribution of a low-mass starless
core, and we follow the propagation of cosmic rays through the core along flux
tubes enclosing different amount of mass. We then extend our analysis to cores
with different mass-to-flux ratios. We find that mirroring always dominates
over focusing, implying a reduction of the cosmic-ray ionization rate by a
factor of about 2-3 over most of a solar-mass core with respect to the value in
the intercloud medium outside the core. For flux tubes enclosing larger masses
the reduction factor is smaller, since the field becomes increasingly uniform
at larger radii and lower densities. We also find that the cosmic-ray
ionization rate is further reduced in clouds with stronger magnetic field, e.g.
by a factor of about 4 for a marginally critical cloud. The magnetic field
threading molecular cloud cores affects the penetration of low-energy cosmic
rays and reduces the ionization rate by a factor 3-4 depending on the position
inside the core and the magnetization of the core.

gamma, or even gamma Z, potentially with larger cross sections times branching
ratios than for the Higgs. The discovery of either a Higgs friend or a Higgs
counterfeit, rather than directly pointing towards the origin of the weak
scale, would indicate the presence of new colored fields necessary for the
sizable production cross section (and possibly new colorless but electroweakly
charged states as well, in the case of the diboson decays of a Higgs friend).
These particles could easily be confused for an ordinary Higgs, perhaps with an
additional generation to explain the different cross section, and we emphasize
the importance of vector boson fusion as a channel to distinguish a Higgs
counterfeit from a true Higgs. Such fields would naturally be expected in
scenarios with ""effective Z's,"" where heavy states charged under the SM produce
effective charges for SM fields under a new gauge force. We discuss the
prospects for discovery of Higgs counterfeits, Higgs friends, and associated
charged fields at the LHC.

to guide the chapter and explore the relationship among the various views and
levels of abstraction. We start with the innermost level, namely, the
structural and chemical view. The edge chemistry of patterned graphene
nanoribbons (GNR) lies intermediate between graphene and benzene, and the
corresponding strain lifts the degeneracy that otherwise promotes metallicity
in bulk graphene. At the same time, roughness at the edges washes out chiral
signatures, making the nanoribbon width the principal arbiter of metallicity.
The width-dependent conductivity allows the design of a monolithically
patterned wide-narrow-wide all graphene interconnect-channel heterostructure.
In a three-terminal incarnation, this geometry exhibits superior
electrostatics, a correspondingly benign short-channel effect and a reduction
in the contact Schottky barrier through covalent bonding. However, the small
bandgaps make the devices transparent to band-to-band tunneling. Increasing the
gap with width confinement (or other ways to break the sublattice symmetry) is
projected to reduce the mobility even for very pure samples, through a
fundamental asymptotic constraint on the bandstructure. An analogous trade-off,
ultimately between error rate (reliability) and delay (switching speed) can be
projected to persist for all graphitic derivatives. Proceeding thus to a higher
level, a compact model is presented to capture the complex nanoribbon circuits,
culminating in inverter characteristics, design metrics and layout diagrams.

widely studied. While there is no consensus on whether MCIs actually ""convert""
to AD, the more important question is not whether MCIs convert, but what is the
best such definition. We focus on automatic prognostication, nominally using
only a baseline image brain scan, of whether an MCI individual will convert to
AD within a multi-year period following the initial clinical visit. This is in
fact not a traditional supervised learning problem since, in ADNI, there are no
definitive labeled examples of MCI conversion. Prior works have defined MCI
subclasses based on whether or not clinical/cognitive scores such as CDR
significantly change from baseline. There are concerns with these definitions,
however, since e.g. most MCIs (and ADs) do not change from a baseline CDR=0.5,
even while physiological changes may be occurring. These works ignore rich
phenotypical information in an MCI patient's brain scan and labeled AD and
Control examples, in defining conversion. We propose an innovative conversion
definition, wherein an MCI patient is declared to be a converter if any of the
patient's brain scans (at follow-up visits) are classified ""AD"" by an
(accurately-designed) Control-AD classifier. This novel definition bootstraps
the design of a second classifier, specifically trained to predict whether or
not MCIs will convert. This second classifier thus predicts whether an
AD-Control classifier will predict that a patient has AD. Our results
demonstrate this new definition leads not only to much higher prognostic
accuracy than by-CDR conversion, but also to subpopulations much more
consistent with known AD brain region biomarkers. We also identify key
prognostic region biomarkers, essential for accurately discriminating the
converter and nonconverter groups.

of 0.08 dex. The origin of the dispersion found in the use of diagnostic
diagrams is probably due to differences between the real N/O-O/H relation of
the sample and the one assumed in the models. This is confirmed by the use of
detailed models that do not have a fixed N/O-O/H relation. We found no
correlation between ionization parameter and the metallicity for the objects of

known in quantum optics. The review discusses similar physics that emerges in
open and marginally stable quantum many-body systems. In the presence of open
decay channels, the intrinsic states are coupled through the continuum. At
sufficiently strong continuum coupling, the spectrum of resonances undergoes
the restructuring with segregation of very broad super-radiant states and
trapping of remaining long-lived compound states. The appropriate formalism
describing this phenomenon is based on the Feshbach projection method and
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. A broader generalization is related to the
idea of doorway states connecting quantum states of different structure. The
method is explained in detail and the examples of applications are given to
nuclear, atomic and particle physics. The interrelation of the collective

changes the aspect of a stellar cluster we computed the evolution until the
ignition of the He burning of stars from 0.7 to 3.5 M_sun within halos of DM
with different characteristics. We found that, when a cluster is surrounded by
a dense DM halo, the positions of the cluster' stars in the H-R diagram have a
brighter and hotter turn-off point than in the classical scenario without DM,
therefore giving the cluster a younger appearance. The high DM densities
required to produce these effects are expected only in very specific locations,
such as near the center of our Galaxy. In particular, if DM is formed by the 8
GeV WIMPs recently invoked to reconcile the results from direct detection
experiments, then this signature is predicted for halos of DM with a density
rho_DM = 3 \cdot 10^5 GeV cm^3. A DM density gradient inside the stellar
cluster would result in a broader main sequence, turn-off and red giant branch
regions. Moreover, we found that for very high DM halo densities the bottom of
the isochrones in the H-R diagram rises to higher luminosities, leading to a
characteristic signature on the stellar cluster. We argue that this signature
could be used to indirectly probe the presence of DM particles in the location

large scale lossless data compression. In this view a theory is scientific if
it can be used to build a data compression program, and it is valuable if it
can compress a standard benchmark database to a small size, taking into account
the length of the compressor itself. This methodology therefore includes an
Occam principle as well as a solution to the problem of demarcation. Because of
the fundamental difficulty of lossless compression, this type of research must
be empirical in nature: compression can only be achieved by discovering and
characterizing empirical regularities in the data. Because of this, the
philosophy provides a way to reformulate fields such as computer vision and
computational linguistics as empirical sciences: the former by attempting to
compress databases of natural images, the latter by attempting to compress
large text databases. The book argues that the rigor and objectivity of the
compression principle should set the stage for systematic progress in these
fields. The argument is especially strong in the context of computer vision,
which is plagued by chronic problems of evaluation.
  The book also considers the field of machine learning. Here the traditional
approach requires that the models proposed to solve learning problems be
extremely simple, in order to avoid overfitting. However, the world may contain
intrinsically complex phenomena, which would require complex models to
understand. The compression philosophy can justify complex models because of
the large quantity of data being modeled (if the target database is 100 Gb, it
is easy to justify a 10 Mb model). The complex models and abstractions learned
on the basis of the raw data (images, language, etc) can then be reused to
solve any specific learning problem, such as face recognition or machine
translation.

phases of solar flares, so the nature of that emission is poorly known. Photons
produced by solar flares can resonantly scatter off atoms and ions in the
corona. Based on off-limb measurements by SOHO/UVCS, we derive the O VI
$\lambda$1032 luminosities for 29 flares during the impulsive phase and the
Ly$\alpha$ luminosities of 5 flares, and we compare them with X-ray
luminosities from GOES measurements. The upper transition region and lower
transition region luminosities of the events observed are comparable. They are
also comparable to the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas at the beginning of
the flare, but after 10-15 minutes the X-ray luminosity usually dominates. In
some cases we can use Doppler dimming to estimate flow speeds of the O VI
emitting gas, and 5 events show speeds in the 40 to 80 $\rm km s^{-1}$ range.
The O VI emission could originate in gas evaporating to fill the X-ray flare
loops, in heated chromospheric gas at the footpoints, or in heated prominence
material in the coronal mass ejection. All three sources may contribute in
different events or even in a single event, and the relative timing of UV and
X-ray brightness peaks, the flow speeds, and the total O VI luminosity favor
each source in one or more events.

is an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. We aim to measure
the evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxy
samples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. We use a
sample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zCOSMOS redshift
survey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs for
which the velocity difference and projected separation of both components with
a confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. We
have identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100
h^{-1} kpc. We find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,
being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers a
galaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsic
luminosity but rather on its stellar mass. We find that the pair fraction and
merger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up to
redshift z=1. We find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosity
or mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that the
evolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies is
relatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}
respectively) mergers h^3 Mpc^{-3} Gyr^{-1}. The dependence of the merger rate
with environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger events
as can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. The environment therefore
has a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolution
therefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmic
time.

a large effect on the overall chemical composition of GJ 1214b's atmosphere,
however these changes mostly take place above the height in the atmosphere that
is probed by transmission spectroscopy. The effects of non-equilibrium
chemistry on GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum are therefore minimal, with the
largest effects taking place if the planet's atmosphere has super-solar
metallicity and a low rate of vertical mixing. Interestingly, we find that the
best fit to the observations of GJ 1214b's atmosphere in transmission occur if
the planet's atmosphere is deficient in CH4, and possesses a cloud layer at a
pressure of ~200 mbar. This is consistent with a picture of efficient methane
photolysis, accompanied by formation of organic haze that obscures the lower
atmosphere of GJ 1214b at optical wavelengths. However, for methane to be
absent from GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum, UV photolysis of this molecule

wave function but only a reduced density matrix $\rho_1$. Nevertheless, there
is a precise way of attributing to it a random wave function $\psi_1$, called
its conditional wave function, whose probability distribution $\mu_1$ depends
on the entangled wave function $\psi\in\mathscr{H}_1\otimes\mathscr{H}_2$ in
the Hilbert space of system and environment together. It also depends on a
choice of orthonormal basis of $\mathscr{H}_2$ but in relevant cases, as we
show, not very much. We prove several universality (or typicality) results
about $\mu_1$, e.g., that if the environment is sufficiently large then for
every orthonormal basis of $\mathscr{H}_2$, most entangled states $\psi$ with
given reduced density matrix $\rho_1$ are such that $\mu_1$ is close to one of
the so-called GAP (Gaussian adjusted projected) measures, $GAP(\rho_1)$. We
also show that, for most entangled states $\psi$ from a microcanonical subspace
(spanned by the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian with energies in a narrow
interval $[E,E+\delta E]$) and most orthonormal bases of $\mathscr{H}_2$,
$\mu_1$ is close to $GAP(\mathrm{tr}_2 \rho_{mc})$ with $\rho_{mc}$ the
normalized projection to the microcanonical subspace. In particular, if the
coupling between the system and the environment is weak, then $\mu_1$ is close
to $GAP(\rho_\beta)$ with $\rho_\beta$ the canonical density matrix on
$\mathscr{H}_1$ at inverse temperature $\beta=\beta(E)$. This provides the
mathematical justification of our claim in [J. Statist. Phys. 125:1193 (2006),

Because close pairs are expected to merge, the three-space functions and
dynamical evolution time estimates provide galaxy accretion rates. We find that
the accretion onto massive blue galaxies and onto red galaxies is dominated by
red companions, and that onto small-mass blue galaxies, red and blue galaxies
make comparable contributions. We integrate over all types of companions and
find that at fixed stellar mass, the total fractional accretion rates onto red
galaxies (\sim 1.5 h70 percent per Gyr) is greater than that onto blue galaxies
(\sim 0.5 h70 percent per Gyr). Although these rates are very low, they are

done by making use of the nonstandard Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). Since the
method is quite new, we present in details its motivation and the formalism. To
make the nonstandard method easily understandable, we include its application
to the FRW model. In the nonstandard LQC, we first solve the Hamiltonian
constraint of the theory at the classical level and find elementary
observables. Physical compound observables are defined in terms of elementary
ones. We find that classical Big Bang singularity is replaced by quantum Big
Bounce transition due to modification of classical theory by holonomy around a
loop with finite size. The energy density of matter fields at the Big Bounce
depends on a free parameter {\lambda}, which value is expected to be determined
from future cosmological observations. The phase space is divided into two
distinct regions: Kasner-like and Kasner-unlike. We use the elementary
observables to quantize volume and directional volume operators in both cases.
Spectra of these operators are bounded from below and discrete, and depend on
{\lambda}. The discreteness may imply a foamy structure of spacetime at
semiclassical level. At the quantum level an evolution of the model is
generated by the so-called true Hamiltonian. This enables introducing a time
parameter valued in the set of all real numbers.

We resort to a simple abelian Higgs model, and discuss the case of R_xi gauges.
By comparing with results obtained using a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian

presented and discussed in physical terms. They go beyond the usual Dirac phase
factors and they exhibit nonlocal quantal behavior, with the well-known
Relativistic Causality of classical fields affecting directly the phases of
wavefunctions in the Schroedinger Picture. These nonlocal phase behaviors,
apparently overlooked in path-integral approaches, give a natural account of
the dynamical nonlocality character of the various (even static) Aharonov-Bohm
phenomena, while at the same time they seem to respect Causality. Indeed, for
particles passing through nonvanishing magnetic or electric fields they lead to
cancellations of Aharonov-Bohm phases at the observation point, generalizing
earlier semiclassical experimental observations (of Werner & Brill) to
delocalized (spread-out) quantum states. This leads to a correction of
previously unnoticed sign-errors in the literature, and to a natural
explanation of the deeper reason why certain time-dependent semiclassical
arguments are consistent with static results in purely quantal Aharonov-Bohm
configurations. These nonlocalities also provide a remedy for misleading
results propagating in the literature (concerning an uncritical use of Dirac
phase factors, that persists since the time of Feynman's work on path
integrals). They are shown to conspire in such a way as to exactly cancel the
instantaneous Aharonov-Bohm phase and recover Relativistic Causality in earlier
""paradoxes"" (such as the van Kampen thought-experiment), and to also complete
Peshkin's discussion of the electric Aharonov-Bohm effect in a causal manner.
The present formulation offers a direct way to address time-dependent single-

recently attracted attention, with respect to the inability of current theories

properties of GRBs in the rest-frame of the progenitor and test for possible
intra-parameter correlations to better understand the intrinsic nature of these

observed by GBM until August 2010. 28 of them belong to the long-duration
population and 4 events were classified as short/hard bursts. For all of these
events we derive, where possible, the intrinsic peak energy in the $\nu
F_{\nu}$ spectrum (\eprest), the duration in the rest-frame, defined as the
time in which 90% of the burst fluence was observed (\tninetyrest) and the
isotropic equivalent bolometric energy (\eiso). Results: The distribution of
\eprest has mean and median values of 1.1 MeV and 750 keV, respectively. A
log-normal fit to the sample of long bursts peaks at ~800 keV. No high-\ep
population is found but the distribution is biased against low \ep values. We
find the lowest possible \ep that GBM can recover to be ~ 15 keV. The

\eiso has mean and median values of $8.9\times 10^{52}$ erg and $8.2 \times

and \eiso (Amati relation) and the one between \eprest and the 1-s peak
luminosity ($L_p$) (Yonetoku relation). Additionally, we observe a parameter
reconstruction effect, i.e. the low-energy power law index $\alpha$ gets softer
when \ep is located at the lower end of the detector energy range. Moreover, we
do not find any significant cosmic evolution of neither \eprest nor

The method requires the non-linearity of the potential to be polynomial-like,

the event horizon, the innermost stable circular orbit, and the ergosphere. We

presenting the models we discuss issues of stability, oscillations, and jets.

properties of stars and globular clusters (GCs) in the `ordinary' elliptical

galaxy surface brightness and colour profiles out to large galactocentric
radii. We compare the latter to metallicities derived using the near-infrared
Calcium Triplet. We obtain stellar kinematics out to ~3.5 effective radii. The
latter appear flattened or elongated beyond ~1.8 effective radii in contrast to
the relatively round photometric isophotes. In fact, NGC 4494 may be a
flattened galaxy, possibly even an S0, seen at an inclination of ~45 degrees.
We publish a catalogue of 431 GC candidates brighter than i=24 based on the
photometry, of which 109 are confirmed spectroscopically and 54 have measured
spectroscopic metallicities. We also report the discovery of 3
spectroscopically confirmed ultra-compact dwarfs around NGC 4494 with measured
metallicities of -0.4<[Fe/H]<-0.3. Based on their properties, we conclude that
they are simply bright GCs. The metal-poor globular clusters are found to be
rotating with similar amplitude as the galaxy stars, while the metal-rich
globular clusters show marginal rotation. We supplement our analysis with
available literature data and results. Using model predictions of galaxy
formation, and a suite of merger simulations, we find that many of the
observational properties of NGC 4494 may be explained by formation in a
relatively recent gas-rich major merger. Complete studies of individual
galaxies incorporating a range of observational avenues and methods such as the
one presented here will be an invaluable tool for constraining the fine details

with any other field in Systems Biology, computational tools are required to
deal with this ocean of data. iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute
quantification) is a technique that allows simultaneous quantification of
proteins from multiple samples. Although iTRAQ data gives useful insights to
the biologist, it is more complex to perform analysis and draw biological
conclusions because of its multi-plexed design. One such problem is to find
proteins that behave in a similar way (i.e. change in abundance) among various
time points since the temporal variations in the proteomics data reveal
important biological information. Distance based methods such as Euclidian
distance or Pearson coefficient, and clustering techniques such as k-mean etc,
are not able to take into account the temporal information of the series. In
this paper, we present an linear-time algorithm for clustering similar patterns
among various iTRAQ time course data irrespective of their absolute values. The
algorithm, referred to as Temporal Pattern Mining(TPM), maps the data from a
Cartesian plane to a discrete binary plane. After the mapping a dynamic
programming technique allows mining of similar data elements that are
temporally closer to each other. The proposed algorithm accurately clusters
iTRAQ data that are temporally closer to each other with more than 99%
accuracy. Experimental results for different problem sizes are analyzed in
terms of quality of clusters, execution time and scalability for large data

molecules and proliferate close to the melting transition. Using a theory for
nucleic acid secondary structures that accounts for the logarithmic entropy c
ln m for a loop of length m, we study homopolymeric single-stranded nucleic
acid chains under external force and varying temperature. In the thermodynamic
limit of a long strand, the chain displays a phase transition between a low
temperature / low force compact (folded) structure and a high temperature /
high force molten (unfolded) structure. The influence of c on phase diagrams,
critical exponents, melting, and force extension curves is derived
analytically. For vanishing pulling force, only for the limited range of loop
exponents 2 < c < 2.479 a melting transition is possible; for c <= 2 the chain
is always in the folded phase and for 2.479 < c always in the unfolded phase. A
force induced melting transition with singular behavior is possible for all
loop exponents c < 2.479 and can be observed experimentally by single molecule
force spectroscopy. These findings have implications for the hybridization or
denaturation of double stranded nucleic acids. The Poland-Scheraga model for
nucleic acid duplex melting does not allow base pairing between nucleotides on
the same strand in denatured regions of the double strand. If the sequence
allows these intra-strand base pairs, we show that for a realistic loop
exponent c ~ 2.1 pronounced secondary structures appear inside the single
strands. This leads to a lower melting temperature of the duplex than predicted
by the Poland-Scheraga model. Further, these secondary structures renormalize
the effective loop exponent c^, which characterizes the weight of a denatured
region of the double strand, and thus affect universal aspects of the duplex

physics can explain the discrepancies found between theory and experiment in
the B -> pi K decays, in particular in A_CP(B^- -> pi^0 K^-) - A_CP(\bar{B}^0
-> pi^+ K^-), but the current precision of the theoretical and experimental
results does not allow to draw a firm conclusion. We argue that the \bar{B}_s
-> phi rho^0 and \bar{B}_s -> phi pi^0 decays offer an additional tool to
investigate this possibility. These purely isospin-violating decays are
dominated by electroweak penguins and we show that in presence of a new physics
contribution their branching ratio can be enhanced by about an order of
magnitude, without violating any constraints from other hadronic B decays. This
makes them very interesting modes for LHCb and future B factories. In
arXiv:1011.6319 we have performed both a model-independent analysis and a study
within realistic New Physics models such as a modified-Z^0-penguin scenario, a
model with an additional Z' boson and the MSSM. In this article we summarise
the most important results of our study.

for various complex-oxide thin film growths, because of its good lattice match
with many complex oxide films. Here, we show that a common thin film processing
technique, argon ion-milling, creates highly conducting layer on the surface of
STO, not only at room temperatures but also at cryogenic temperatures at which
thermal diffusion is completely suppressed. Systematic \emph{in situ}
four-point conductance measurements were taken on single-crystal STO substrates
inside vacuum environment. The evolution of metallicity out of insulating STO
follows simple models based on oxygen vacancy doping effect. At cryogenic
temperatures, ion milling created a thin - but much thicker than the
argon-penetration depth - steady-state oxygen-vacant layer, leading to a
highly-concentric metallic state. Near room temperatures, however, significant
thermal diffusion occurred and the metallic state continuously diffused into
the bulk, leaving only low concentraion of electron carriers on the surface.
Analysis of the discrepancy between the experiments and the models also
provided evidence for vacany clustering, which seems to occur during any
vacancy formation process and affects the observed conductance. These
observations suggest that the transport properties of films processed on STO
substrates using energetic methods such as ion milling need to be taken with
caution. On the other hand, if properly controlled, ionic bombardment could be
used as a way to create selective conducting layers on the surface of STO for
device applications.

Surveys, as well as simultaneous Chandra X-ray data. The V ~ 22.6
spectroscopically identified optical counterpart is part of a loose cluster
with an age <~ 20 Myr. Consequently, the mass upper limit on individual stars
in the association is about 20 M_sun. The counterpart is more luminous than the
other stars of the association, suggesting a non-negligible optical
contribution from the accretion disk. An observed UV excess also points to
non-stellar light similar to X-ray active low-mass X-ray binaries. A broad
HeII4686 emission line identified in the optical spectrum of the ULX further
suggests optical light from X-ray reprocessing in the accretion disk. Using
stellar evolutionary tracks, we have constrained the mass of the counterpart to
be >~ 10 M_sun, even if the accretion disk contributes significantly to the
optical luminosity. Comparison of the photometric properties of the counterpart
with binary models show that the donor may be more massive, >~ 25 M_sun, with
the ULX system likely undergoing case AB mass transfer. Finally, the
counterpart exhibits photometric variability of 0.14 mag between two HST
observations separated by 50 days which could be due to ellipsoidal variations
and/or disk reprocessing of variable X-ray emission.

worker nodes compute stochastic gradients based on local information in
parallel, which may give rise to delays due to asynchrony. We take motivation
from statistical problems where the size of the data is so large that it cannot
fit on one computer; with the advent of huge datasets in biology, astronomy,

show that for smooth stochastic problems, the delays are asymptotically
negligible and we can achieve order-optimal convergence results. In application
to distributed optimization, we develop procedures that overcome communication
bottlenecks and synchronization requirements. We show $n$-node architectures
whose optimization error in stochastic problems---in spite of asynchronous
delays---scales asymptotically as $\order(1 / \sqrt{nT})$ after $T$ iterations.
This rate is known to be optimal for a distributed system with $n$ nodes even
in the absence of delays. We additionally complement our theoretical results

current decay of the heavier neutral octet scalar into its lighter charged
partner which decays into the two jets. In the MFV scenario, the production of
the neutral color-octet is dominated by gluon fusion due to the Yukawa
suppression of production via initial state quarks. As a result, no visible
excess is expected in the \gamma+jj channel due to Yukawa and CKM suppression.
Contributions to the Z+jj final state are suppressed for a mass spectrum where
the decay of the heavier color-octet to this final state is mediated by an
off-shell neutral color-octet partner. MFV allows one to control fraction of
bottom quarks in the final state jets by a single ratio of two free parameters.

d-wave superconductivity on the checkerboard Hubbard model on a square lattice
using the Cellular Dynamical Mean Field theory method with an exact
diagonalization solver at zero temperature. The d-wave order parameter is
computed for various inhomogeneity levels over the entire doping range of
interest in both strong and weak coupling regimes. At a given doping, the size
of the d-wave order parameter manifests itself directly in the height of the
coherence peaks and hence is an appropriate measure of the strength of
superconductivity. The weak coupling results reveal a suppression of the order
parameter in the presence of inhomogeneity for small to intermediate hole
dopings, while it is enhanced for large dopings. In contrast, for strong
coupling there is a monotonic decrease in the maximum amplitude of the
superconducting order parameter with inhomogeneity over the entire doping range
of interest. Furthermore, at moderately high inhomogeneity, the system
undergoes a first-order transition from the superconducting to the normal state
in the underdoped regime. In the overdoped regime, the change in the value of
the superconducting order parameter correlates with the height of the lowest
energy peak in the spectral weight of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations,
confirming the connection between antiferromagnetic fluctuations and d-wave

depends only on the graph H. Except for a few special cases, this conjecture
remains wide open. However, it is known that a H-free graph must contain a

that models lack of synchronization. Input bits are deleted independently with
probability d, and when they are not deleted, they are not affected by the
channel. Despite significant effort, little is known about the capacity of this
channel, and even less about optimal coding schemes. In this paper we develop a
new systematic approach to this problem, by demonstrating that capacity can be
computed in a series expansion for small deletion probability. We compute three
leading terms of this expansion, and find an input distribution that achieves
capacity up to this order. This constitutes the first optimal coding result for
the deletion channel.
  The key idea employed is the following: We understand perfectly the deletion
channel with deletion probability d=0. It has capacity 1 and the optimal input
distribution is i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2). It is natural to expect that the channel
with small deletion probabilities has a capacity that varies smoothly with d,
and that the optimal input distribution is obtained by smoothly perturbing the
i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) process. Our results show that this is indeed the case.
We think that this general strategy can be useful in a number of capacity
calculations.

of a coordinated optical and gravitational wave search of neutron star mergers.
Model R-band optical afterglow light curves of these bursts that include a
jet-break are extrapolated for these sources at the sensitivity horizon of an
Advanced LIGO/Virgo network. Using optical sensitivity limits of three
telescopes, namely TAROT (m=18), Zadko (m=21) and an (8-10) meter class
telescope (m=26), we approximate detection rates and cadence times for imaging.
We find a median coincident detection rate of 4 yr^{-1} for the three bursts.
GRB 050724 like bursts, with wide opening jet angles, offer the most optimistic
rate of 13 coincident detections yr^{-1}, and would be detectable by Zadko up
to five days after the trigger. Late time imaging to m=26 could detect off-axis
afterglows for GRB 051221 like bursts several months after the trigger. For a
broad distribution of beaming angles, the optimal strategy for identifying the
optical emissions triggered by gravitational wave detectors is rapid response
searches with robotic telescopes followed by deeper imaging at later times if
an afterglow is not detected within several days of the trigger.

selection-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing network wherein
source nodes are assisted by fixed decode-and-forward relays. The joint problem
of transmission strategy selection, relay assignment, and power allocation is a
combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. To develop effective
solutions to these questions, we approach these problems in two stages. The
first set of problems assume ideal source-relay channels; this simplification
helps illustrate our general methodology and also why our solutions provide
tight bounds. We then formulate the general problem of transmission strategy
selection, relay assignment, and power allocation at the sources and relays
considering all communication channels, i.e., finite power source-relay
channels. In both sets of problems mentioned so far, transmissions over
subcarriers are assumed to be independent. However, given the attendant
problems of synchronization and the implementation using a FFT/IFFT pair,
resource allocation at the subcarrier level appears impractical. We, therefore,
consider resource allocation at the level of an entire OFDM block. While
optimal resource management requires an exhaustive search, we develop tight
bounds with lower complexity. Finally, we propose a decentralized block-based
relaying scheme. Simulation results using the COST-231 channel model show that
this scheme yields close-to-optimal performance while offering many
computational benefits.

overview of recent work on the theory of randomized matrix algorithms as well

ideas that underlie not only recent theoretical advances but also the
usefulness of these tools in large-scale data applications. Crucial in this

concept has long been used in statistical regression diagnostics to identify
outliers; and it has recently proved crucial in the development of improved
worst-case matrix algorithms that are also amenable to high-quality numerical
implementation and that are useful to domain scientists. Randomized methods
solve problems such as the linear least-squares problem and the low-rank matrix
approximation problem by constructing and operating on a randomized sketch of
the input matrix. Depending on the specifics of the situation, when compared
with the best previously-existing deterministic algorithms, the resulting
randomized algorithms have worst-case running time that is asymptotically
faster; their numerical implementations are faster in terms of clock-time; or
they can be implemented in parallel computing environments where existing
numerical algorithms fail to run at all. Numerous examples illustrating these
observations will be described in detail.

fields. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic

interchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that
rapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this
finding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is
that rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in
the presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,
unstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is
developed. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.
Contrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an
equilibrium state after the development of the turbulence. This conclusion
suggests that three-dimensional simulation is indispensable for exploring the
formation of magnetars or prominence activities of magnetars such as giant
flares.

corresponding to the modes of a quantum scalar field propagating in a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with arbitrary coupling to the scalar
curvature, whose exact mode functions can be expanded as an infinite adiabatic
series. While for a massive field this is a good approximation for all modes
when the mass of the field m is larger than the Hubble parameter H, for a
massless field only the subhorizon modes with comoving wave-numbers larger than
some fixed k* obeying k*/a>H can be analyzed in this way. As infinities coming
from adiabatic zero, second and fourth order expressions are removed by
adiabatic regularization, the leading order finite contribution to the
stress-energy tensor is given by the adiabatic order six terms, which we
determine explicitly. For massive and massless modes these have the magnitudes
H^6/m^2 and H^6a^2/k*^2, respectively, and higher order corrections are
suppressed by additional powers of (H/m)^2 and (Ha/k*)^2. When the scale factor
in the conformal time \eta is a simple power a(\eta)=(1/\eta)^n, the
stress-energy tensor obeys P=w\rho with w=(n-2)/n for massive and w=(n-6)/(3n)
for massless modes. In that case, the adiabaticity is eventually lost when
0<n<1 for massive and when 0<n<3/2 for massless fields since in time H/m and
Ha/k* become order one. We discuss the implications of these results for de
Sitter and other cosmologically relevant spaces.

partners is supposed to be dominantly driven by entropy. Recent calorimetric
experiments and computer simulations heavily challenge this established
paradigm by reporting that water's thermodynamic signature in the binding of
small hydrophobic ligands to similar-sized apolar pockets is enthalpy-driven.
Here we show with purely geometric considerations that this controversy can be
resolved if the antagonistic effects of concave and convex bending on water
interface thermodynamics are properly taken into account. A key prediction of
this continuum view is that for fully complementary binding of the convex
ligand to the concave counterpart, water shows a thermodynamic signature very
similar to planar (large-scale) hydrophobic association, that is,
enthalpy-dominated, and hardly depends on the particular pocket/ligand
geometry. A detailed comparison to recent simulation data qualitatively
supports the validity of our perspective down to subnanometer scales. Our
findings have important implications for the interpretation of thermodynamic
signatures found in molecular recognition and association processes.
Furthermore, traditional implicit solvent models may benefit from our view with
respect to their ability to predict binding free energies and entropies.

local processes and structures of turbulent star-forming gas. A volume element
of the interstellar medium is described as a multiphase system, comprising a
cold and a warm gas phase in effective (thermal plus turbulent) pressure
equilibrium, and a stellar component. Since turbulence has a critical impact on
the shape of the gaseous phases, on the production of molecular hydrogen and on
the formation of stars, the consistent treatment of turbulence energy -- the
kinetic energy of unresolved motions -- is an important new feature of our
model. Besides turbulence production by supernovae and by the cooling
instability, we also take into account the forcing by large scale motions.
  We formulate a set of ordinary differential equations, which statistically
describes star formation and the exchange between the different budgets of mass
and energy in a region of the interstellar medium with given mean density,
size, metallicity and external turbulence forcing. By exploring the behaviour
of the solutions, we find equilibrium states, in which the star formation
efficiencies are consistent with observations. Kennicutt-Schmidt-like relations
naturally arise from the equilibrium solutions, while conventional star
formation models in numerical simulations impose such relations with observed
efficiency parameters as phenomenological calibrations.
  Beyond the semi-analytic approach, a potential application is a complete
subgrid scale model of the unresolved multi-phase structure, star formation and
turbulence in simulations of galaxies or in cosmological simulations. The
formulation presented in this article combines various models focusing on
particular processes and yet can be adopted to specific applications, depending
on the range of resolved length scales.

edge weights is introduced. Each vertex is independently equipped with a random
number of half-edges and each half-edge is assigned an integer valued weight
according to a distribution that is allowed to depend on the degree of its
vertex. Half-edges with the same weight are then paired randomly to create
edges. An expression for the threshold for the appearance of a giant component
in the resulting graph is derived using results on multi-type branching
processes. The same technique also gives an expression for the basic
reproduction number for an epidemic on the graph where the probability that a
certain edge is used for transmission is a function of the edge weight. It is
demonstrated that, if vertices with large degree tend to have large (small)
weights on their edges and if the transmission probability increases with the
edge weight, then it is easier (harder) for the epidemic to take off compared
to a randomized epidemic with the same degree and weight distribution. A recipe
for calculating the probability of a large outbreak in the epidemic and the
size of such an outbreak is also given. Finally, the model is fitted to three
empirical weighted networks of importance for the spread of contagious diseases
and it is shown that $R_0$ can be substantially over- or underestimated if the
correlation between degree and weight is not taken into account.

fraction of Lyman-Alpha radiation in galaxies in the redshift range 5<z<7,
based on the MareNostrum High-z Universe, a SPH cosmological simulation with
more than 2 billion particles. We approximate Lyman-Alpha Emitters (LAEs) as
dusty gaseous slabs with Lyman-Alpha radiation sources homogeneously mixed in
the gas. Escape fractions for such a configuration and for different gas and
dust contents are calculated using our newly developed radiative transfer code
CLARA. The results are applied to the MareNostrum High-z Universe numerical
galaxies. The model shows a weak redshift evolution and good agreement with
estimations of the escape fraction as a function of reddening from observations
at z \sim 2.2 and z \sim 3. We extend the slab model by including additional
dust in a clumpy component in order to reproduce the UV con- tinuum luminosity
function and UV colours at redshifts z>~5. The LAE Luminosity Function (LF)
based on the extended clumpy model reproduces broadly the bright end of the LF
derived from observations at z \sim 5 and z \sim 6. At z \sim 7 our model
over-predicts the LF by roughly a factor of four, presumably because the
effects of the neutral intergalactic medium are not taken into account. The
remaining tension between the observed and simulated faint end of the LF, both
in the UV-continuum and Lyman-Alpha at redshifts z \sim 5 and z \sim 6 points
towards an overabundance of simulated LAEs hosted in haloes of masses
1.0x10^10h-1Msol < Mh < 4.0x10^10h-1Msol. Given the difficulties in explaining
the observed overabundance by dust absorption, a probable origin of the
mismatch are the high star formation rates in the simulated haloes around the
quoted mass range. A more efficient supernova feedback should be able to
regulate the star formation process in the shallow potential wells of these
haloes.

weight. Upon doping spectra tend to soften and broaden, with a transfer of
spectral weight towards higher energy. However, the total spectral weight and
average peak position of either response are only weakly affected by doping up
to a concentration of 1/8. Only the two-spin response at $\pi$ changes
strongly, with a large reduction of spectral weight and enhancement of

on a doublet that is comprised of asymmetrically coated self-propelling

cross-layer module residing between CR module and routing. The proposed PCTC
scheme uses cognitive link availability prediction, which is aware of the

CR-MANETs. Based on the link prediction, PCTC constructs an efficient and
reliable topology, which is aimed at mitigating re-routing frequency and
improving end-to-end network performance such as throughput and delay.

redshift GRBs, we show that the correlation parameters only weakly depend on
the cosmological model. Once the parameters of Amati relation have been
determined we use this relation to construct a fiducial GRBs Hubble diagram
that extends up to redshifts ~ 8. Moreover we apply a local regression
technique to estimate, in a model independent way, the distance modulus from
the recently updated Union SNIa sample, containing 557 SNIa spanning the
redshift range of 0.015 < z <1.55. The derived calibration parameters are used
to construct an updated GRBs Hubble diagram, which we call the calibrated GRBs
HD. We also compare the fiducial and calibrated GRBs HDs, which turned out to
be fully statistically consistent, thus indicating that they are not affected
by any systematic bias induced by the different calibration procedures. This
means that the high redshift GRBs can be used to test different models of dark
energy settling the circularity problem. Furthermore, we investigate possible
evolutionary effects that might have important influence on our results. Our
analysis indicates that the presently available GRBs datasets do not show
statistically unambiguous evolutionary effect with the cosmological redshift.
Finally we propose another approach to calibrate the GRB relations, by using an
approximate luminosity distance relation, which holds in any cosmological
model. We use this calibration of the Amati relation to construct an empirical
approximate HD, which we compare with the calibrated GRBs HD. We finally
investigate the implications of this approach for the high redshift

and highly complex environment. To obtain a full census of this interaction,
the Formation and Early evolution of Massive Stars (FEMS) collaboration studies
a well-selected sample of 10 high-mass star-forming regions. Aims. In this
study we examine the stellar content of the high-mass star-forming region
centered on IRAS 06084-0611 in the Monoceros R2 cloud. Methods. Using the
near-infrared H- and K-band spectra from the VLT/SINFONI instrument on the ESO
Very Large Telescope (VLT)and photometric near-infrared NTT/SOFI, 2MASS and
Spitzer/IRAC data, we were able to determine the spectral types for the most
luminous stars in the cluster. Results. Two very young and reddened massive
stars have been detected by SINFONI: a massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) con-
sistent with an early-B spectral type and a Herbig Be star. Furthermore, stars
of spectral type G and K are detected while still in the Pre-Main Sequence
(PMS) phase. We derive additional properties such as temperatures, extinctions,
radii and masses. We present a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and find most
objects having intermediate masses between \sim1.5-2.5 M\odot. For these stars
we derive a median cluster age of \sim4 Myr. Conclusions. Using Spitzer/IRAC
data we confirm earlier studies that the younger class 0/I objects are
centrally located while the class II objects are spread out over a larger area,
with rough scale size radii of \sim0.5 pc and \sim1.25 pc respectively.
Moreover, the presence of a massive YSO, an ultracompact H ii region and highly
reddened objects in the center of the cluster suggest a much younger age of < 1
Myr. A possible scenario for this observation would be sequential star
formation along the line of sight; from a cluster of intermediate-mass to
high-mass stars.

the $k$-space overlap potential are stealthy ({\it i.e.,} completely suppress
single scattering of radiation for a range of wavelengths) and hyperuniform
({\it i.e.,} infinite wavelength density fluctuations vanish). However, we show
via quantitative metrics that the inherent structures exhibit a range of
stealthiness and hyperuniformity depending on the fraction of degrees of
freedom that are constrained. Inherent structures in two dimensions typically
contain five-particle rings, wavy grain boundaries, and vacancy-interstitial
defects. The structural and thermodynamic properties of inherent structures are
relatively insensitive to the temperature from which they are sampled,
signifying that the energy landscape is relatively flat and devoid of deep
wells. Using the nudged-elastic-band algorithm, we construct paths from
ground-state configurations to inherent structures and identify the transition
points between them. In addition, we use point patterns generated from a random
sequential addition (RSA) of hard disks, which are nearly stealthy, and examine
the particle rearrangements necessary to make the configurations absolutely
stealthy. We introduce a configurational proximity metric to show that only
small local, but collective, particle rearrangements are needed to drive
initial RSA configurations to stealthy disordered ground states. These results
lead to a more complete understanding of the unusual behaviors exhibited by the
family of ""collective-coordinate"" potentials to which the $k$-space overlap

Many scientists tried to derive the rank-size scaling relation by
entropy-maximizing methods, but the problem failed to be resolved thoroughly.
By introducing a pivotal constraint condition, I present here a set of new
derivations based on the self-similar hierarchy of cities. First, I derive a
pair of exponent laws by postulating local entropy maximizing. From the two
exponential laws follows a general hierarchical scaling law, which implies
general Zipf's law. Second, I derive a special hierarchical scaling law with
exponent equal to 1 by postulating global entropy maximizing, and this implies
the strong form of Zipf's law. The rank-size scaling law proved to be one of
the special cases of the hierarchical law, and the derivation suggests a
certain scaling range with the first or last data point as an outlier. The
entropy maximization of social systems differs from the notion of entropy
increase in thermodynamics. For urban systems, entropy maximizing suggests the
best equilibrium state of equity for parts/individuals and efficiency for the

effect as it does not necessarily involve passing through a classically
forbidden region via evanescent waves. A crucial role in Klein tunneling is
played by the conservation of (sublattice) pseudo-spin, which is discussed in
detail. A major consequence is the absence of backscattering at normal
incidence, of which we give a new shorten proof. The current experimental
status is also thoroughly reviewed. The appendix contains the discussion of a

\equiv (\lambda_x, \lambda_y, \lambda_z)$, whose magnitude $\lambda$ determines
the gauge coupling strength, generates a generalized Rashba spin-orbit
interaction. For a weak attractive interaction in the singlet channel described
by a small negative scattering length $(\kf |\as| \lesssim 1)$, the ground
state in the absence of the gauge field ($\lambda=0$) is a BCS
(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) superfluid with large overlapping pairs. With
increasing gauge coupling strength, a non-Abelian gauge field engenders a
crossover of this BCS ground state to a BEC (Bose-Einstein condensate) ground
state of bosons even with a weak attractive interaction that fails to produce a
two-body bound state in free vacuum. For large gauge couplings $(\lambda/\kf
\gg 1)$, the BEC attained is a condensate of bosons whose properties are solely
determined by the gauge field (and not by the scattering length so long as it
is non-zero) -- we call these bosons ""rashbons"". In the absence of interactions
($\as = 0^-$), the shape of the Fermi surface of the system undergoes a
topological transition at a critical gauge coupling $\lambda_T$. For high
symmetry gauge field configurations we show that the crossover from the BCS
superfluid to the rashbon BEC occurs in the regime of $\lambda$ near
$\lambda_T$. In the context of cold atomic systems, this work makes an
interesting suggestion of obtaining

NP-completeness of the active interval maximization problem even for
unit-square labels. We then present a constant-factor approximation for this

an explicit formula for the force is available only in a particular gauge
(Lorenz gauge), where the force in other gauges must be found through a
transformation law once the Lorenz gauge force is known. For a class of gauges
satisfying a ``parity condition'' ensuring that the Hamiltonian center of mass
of the particle is well-defined, I show that the gravitational self-force is
always given by the angle-average of the bare gravitational force. To derive
this result I replace the computational strategy of previous work with a new
approach, wherein the form of the force is first fixed up to a gauge-invariant
piece by simple manipulations, and then that piece is determined by working in
a gauge designed specifically to simplify the computation. This offers
significant computational savings over the Lorenz gauge, since the Hadamard
expansion is avoided entirely and the metric perturbation takes a very simple
form. I also show that the rest mass of the particle does not evolve due to
first-order self-force effects. Finally, I consider the ``mode sum
regularization'' scheme for computing the self-force in black hole background
spacetimes, and use the angle-average form of the force to show that the same
mode-by-mode subtraction may be performed in all parity-regular gauges. It
appears plausible that suitably modified versions of the Regge-Wheeler and

of the source space and its relevant subspaces. Unlike persistence of real
valued maps, circle valued maps enjoy a different class of invariants called
Jordan cells in addition to bar codes. We establish a relation between the
homology of the source space and of its relevant subspaces with these
invariants and provide a new algorithm to compute these invariants from an
input matrix that encodes a circle valued map on an input simplicial complex.

such as uranium, cadmium, cobalt, europium and arsenic. Most of the studies,
performed so far, are on a laboratory scale without any attempts to be applied
at larger either pilot or industrial scales. This especially invokes an
analysis addressing what it would be when the scale of application increases
beyond that of the laboratory flask. This point is of primary importance when
fashionable nano-scale magnetite particles are used for sorption. The choice of
magnetite is special because this mineral exhibits strong magnetic properties
easily allowing creation of devices and processes for both upstream

magnetically stabilized beds, magnetic separation, and remote deposition of

Using a recently developed master equation approach we investigate the
influence of two concurrent processes. First, at a nonzero temperature thermal
fluctuations allow an activated breaking of contacts which are still below the
threshold. As a result, the friction force monotonically increases with
velocity. Second, the aging of contacts leads to a decrease of the friction
force with velocity. Aging effects include two aspects: the delay in contact
formation and aging of a contact itself, i.e., the change of its
characteristics with the duration of stationary contact. All these processes
are considered simultaneously with the master equation approach, giving a
complete dependence of the kinetic friction force on the driving velocity and
system temperature, provided the interface parameters are known.

capabilities of the robots (i.e. the larger the initial configuration set, the

are assumed to be anonymous and oblivious, and the execution model is the
non-atomic CORDA model with asynchronous fair scheduling. Our protocol allows
the largest set of initial configurations (with respect to impossibility
results) yet uses the weakest multiplicity detector to date. The time
complexity of our protocol is O(n2), where n denotes the size of the ring.

spiral galaxies provides critical clues to their formation and evolution, but
it is generally difficult to determine. For spiral galaxies that are strong
gravitational lenses, however, the combination of lensing and kinematic
observations can be used to break the disk-halo degeneracy. In turn, such data
constrain fundamental parameters such as i) the mass density profile slope and
axis ratio of the dark matter halo, and by comparison with dark matter-only
numerical simulations the modifications imposed by baryons; ii) the mass in

normalization of the stellar initial mass function. In this first paper of a

lensing spiral galaxies, for which multi-band high-resolution images and
rotation curves were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck-II
Telescope as part of the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS). The
sample includes 8 newly discovered secure systems. [abridged] We find that the
SWELLS sample of secure lenses spans a broad range of morphologies (from
lenticular to late-type spiral), spectral types (quantified by Halpha
emission), and bulge to total stellar mass ratio (0.22-0.85), while being
limited to M_*>10^{10.5} M_sun. The SWELLS sample is thus well-suited for
exploring the relationship between dark and luminous matter in a broad range of
galaxies. We find that the deflector galaxies obey the same size-mass relation
as that of a comparison sample of elongated non-lens galaxies selected from the
SDSS survey. We conclude that the SWELLS sample is consistent with being
representative of the overall population of high-mass high-inclination disky

numerically and analytically. The van Kampen perturbative scheme is
implemented, beyond the second order approximation, so to capture the non
Gaussianity traits as displayed by the simulations. The method is targeted to
the characterization of the third moments of the distribution of fluctuations,
originating from a system of four populations in mutual interaction. The theory
predictions agree well with the simulations, pointing to the validity of the
van Kampen expansion beyond the conventional Gaussian solution.

potassium chloride and gelatin. The first substance has shown flat spectra from
$\sim$100 kHz down to sub-Hz range, while the results on gelatin clearly show
the existence of two distinct low frequency conductive relaxations.

nano-networks reveal that the aerosil-induced disorder significantly alters
both the nematic to Smectic-A and Smectic-A to Smectic-C phase transitions. The
limiting Smectic-A correlation length follows a power-law dependence on the
aerosil density in quantitative agreement with the limiting lengths measured
previously in other Smectic-A liquid crystal gels. The Smectic-A to Smectic-C
liquid crystalline phase transition is altered fundamentally by the presence of
the aerosil gel. The onset of the Smectic-C phase remains relatively sharp but
there is an extended coexistence region where Smectic-A and Smectic-C domains
can exist.

in 190Pt (\epsilon\beta^+ and 2\epsilon) have been established on the level of
10^{14}-10^{16} yr, 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those known
previously. In particular, a possible resonant double electron capture in 190Pt
was restricted on the level of 2.9 \times 10^{16} yr at 90% C.L. In addition,
T_{1/2} limit on 2 beta^- decay of 198Pt (2\nu+0\nu) to the 2^+_1 excited level
of 198Hg has been set at the first time: T_{1/2}>3.5 \times 10^{18} yr. The

infinity and the other being zero is demonstrated to behave as a superlens for

extraordinary transmission of evanescent waves is attributed to the zero mass
effect. Microstructure design for such anisotropic lens is also presented. In
contrast to the anisotropic superlens based on Fabry-P\'erot resonant
mechanism, the proposed lens operates without the limitation on lens thickness,
thus more flexible in practical applications. Numerical modeling is performed
to validate the proposed ideas.

considering both local energy momentum conservation equation as well as
particle number conservation equation. It is also emphasized that we are
considering here a {\em non-singular} fluid governed by purely classical
general relativity. Therefore, we are not considering here any semi-classical
or quantum gravity which apparently suggests thermodynamical properties even
for a (singular) black hole. Having made such a clarification, we formulate a
global first law of thermodynamics for an adiabatically evolving spherical
perfect fluid. It may be verified that such a global first law of
thermodynamics, {\em for a non-singular fluid}, has not been formulated
earlier.

  3, No. 2, April 2011, 39-45",,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi input multi output antenna systems, beamforming is a technique for
guarding against the negative effects of fading. However, this technique
requires the transmitter to have perfect knowledge of the channel which is
often not available a priori. A solution to overcome this problem is to design
the beamforming vector using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the
receiver to the transmitter. In the case of limited feedback, the beamforming
vector is limited to lie in a codebook that is known to both the transmitter
and receiver.When the feedback is strictly limited, important issues are how to
quantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in
associated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback
available.In this paper channel quantization schema using simple approach to
codebook design (random vector quantization)is illustrated. Performance results
show that even with a few bits of feedback, performance can be close to that
with perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter.

high potential in guiding and manipulating sound energy. In this paper, we
further develop the idea by using periodically layered structures for
transformational acoustics. Such a simple scheme periodically inserts
identically bent solid plates in a background fluid. It forms a metamaterial
with high refractive index normal to the curved plates and an index near to one
along the plates. We show that the periodically layered structure, combined
with transformation approach, can be cut into particular device shapes for
acoustic cloaking and illusion.
