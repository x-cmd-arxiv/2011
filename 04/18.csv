monochromatic laser field, and interacting collectively with the vacuum
electromagnetic field. A Born-Markov-secular master equation is used to
describe the dynamics of the two atoms and their steady-state is obtained
analytically for two configurations, one in which the atoms are in equivalent
positions and another in which they are not. The steady-state populations of
the energy levels of the free atoms, entanglement, quantum discord and degree
of mixed-ness are calculated analytically as a function of the laser field
intensity and the distance between the two atoms. It is found that driving both
atoms with the laser field is inefficient for the generation of steady-state
correlations when they are in equivalent positions. On the contrary,
inequivalent positions lead to the possibility of considerable steady-state
entanglement and left/right quantum discord. It is shown that an X-state can be

the comparison of two measures of quantum discord. The behaviour and

coupling parameter for horizontal (spacelike) plaquettes, $\beta_H$, differs
from that for vertical (Euclidean timelike) plaquettes, $\beta_V$. When
$\beta_H \rightarrow \infty$ the system, when in Coulomb Gauge, splits into
multiple independent 3-d O(4) Heisenberg models on spacelike hyperlayers.
Through consideration of the robustness of the Heisenberg model phase
transition to small perturbations, and illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations,
it is shown that the ferromagnetic phase transition in this model persists for
$\beta_H < \infty$. Once it has entered the phase-plane it must continue to
another edge due to its symmetry-breaking nature, and therefore must
necessarily cross the $\beta_V = \beta_H$ line at a finite value. Indeed, a
higher-order SU(2) phase transition is found at $\beta = 3.18 \pm 0.08$, from a
finite-size scaling analysis of the Coulomb gauge magnetization from Monte
Carlo simulations, which also yields critical exponents. An important technical
breakthrough is the use of open boundary conditions, which is shown to reduce
systematic and random errors of the overrelaxation gauge-fixing algorithm by a
factor of several hundred. The string tension and specific heat are also shown
to be consistent with finite-order scaling about this critical point using the
same critical exponents.

perspective of theoretical computer science. This is mainly due to the fact
that these norms provide a method for testing whether the maximum correlation
of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_p^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p$ with polynomials of
degree at most $d \le p$ is non-negligible, while making only a constant number
of queries to the function. This is an instance of {\em correlation testing}.
In this framework, a fixed test is applied to a function, and the acceptance
probability of the test is dependent on the correlation of the function from
the property. This is an analog of {\em proximity oblivious testing}, a notion
coined by Goldreich and Ron, in the high error regime. In this work, we study
general properties which are affine invariant and which are correlation
testable using a constant number of queries. We show that any such property (as
long as the field size is not too small) can in fact be tested by Gowers
uniformity tests, and hence having correlation with the property is equivalent
to having correlation with degree $d$ polynomials for some fixed $d$. We stress
that our result holds also for non-linear properties which are affine
invariant. This completely classifies affine invariant properties which are
correlation testable. The proof is based on higher-order Fourier analysis.
Another ingredient is a nontrivial extension of a graph theoretical theorem of
Erd\""os, Lov\'asz and Spencer to the context of additive number theory.

of the two-dimensional screened potential. In contrast to three-dimensional
systems where the macroscopic screening can be described by a static dielectric
constant in 2D systems the macroscopic screening is non local (q-dependent)
showing a logarithmic divergence for small distances and reaching the
unscreened Coulomb potential for large distances. The cross-over of these two
regimes is dictated by 2D layer polarizability that can be easily computed by
standard first-principles techniques. The present results have strong
implications for describing gap-impurity levels and also exciton binding
energies. The simple model derived here captures the main physical effects and
reproduces well, for the case of graphane, the full many-body GW plus
Bethe-Salpeter calculations. As an additional outcome we show that the impurity
hole-doping in graphane leads to strongly localized states, what hampers
applications in electronic devices. In spite of the inefficient and nonlocal
two-dimensional macroscopic screening we demonstrate that a simple
$\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ approach is capable to describe the electronic and
transport properties of confined 2D systems.

subquadratic symbolic algorithm to compute the almost-sure winning set for MDPs

compared to the previous known algorithm that takes O(n^2) symbolic steps,
where $n$ is the number of states and $m$ is the number of edges of the MDP. In
practice MDPs have constant out-degree, and then our symbolic algorithm takes
O(n \sqrt{n}) symbolic steps, as compared to the previous known $O(n^2)$
symbolic steps algorithm. Second, we present a new algorithm, namely win-lose
algorithm, with the following two properties: (a) the algorithm iteratively
computes subsets of the almost-sure winning set and its complement, as compared
to all previous algorithms that discover the almost-sure winning set upon
termination; and (b) requires O(n \sqrt{K}) symbolic steps, where K is the
maximal number of edges of strongly connected components (scc's) of the MDP.
The win-lose algorithm requires symbolic computation of scc's. Third, we
improve the algorithm for symbolic scc computation; the previous known
algorithm takes linear symbolic steps, and our new algorithm improves the
constants associated with the linear number of steps. In the worst case the
previous known algorithm takes 5n symbolic steps, whereas our new algorithm
takes 4n symbolic steps.

models of rigid and soft two-state motors, the binding/unbinding dynamics of
the motor heads and the dependence of the transition rates on the load exerted

number of detected molecular species of any extragalactic object so far. The
results of our rotation diagram analysis show that the rotation temperatures
are close to the cosmic microwave background temperature of 5.14 K that we

magnitude higher, indicating that the gas is subthermally excited. The
molecular fractional abundances are found to be in-between those in typical
Galactic diffuse and translucent clouds, and clearly deviate from those

massive stars. [...] We also report the discovery of several new absorption
components, with velocities spanning between -300 and +170 km/s. Finally, the
line centroids of several species (e.g., CH3OH, NH3) are found to be
significantly offset from the average velocity. If caused by a variation in the

these transition form factors at the large $Q^2$ region will be able to
distinguish the four models of the pion DA. The rapid growth of the large $Q^2$
data for the pion-photon transition form factor reported by the BaBar
Collaboration is difficult to explain within the current framework of QCD. If
the BaBar data for the meson-photon transition form factor for the $\pi^0$ is
confirmed, it could indicate physics beyond-the-standard model, such as a
weakly-coupled elementary $C=+$ axial vector or pseudoscalar $z^0$ in the few
GeV domain, an elementary field which would provide the coupling $\gamma^*$
$\gamma$ to $z^0$ to $\pi^0$ at leading twist. Our analysis thus indicates the
importance of additional measurements of the pion-photon transition form factor
at large $Q^2$.

high ($\sim 0.95$). In the second scenario, the first optical flare is the low
energy prompt emission and the second one is the reverse shock of the initial
outflow. Within this scenario we can interpret the late afterglow emission
self-consistently. The reverse shock region may be weakly magnetized and the
decline of the second optical flare may be dominated by the high latitude
emission, for which strong polarization evolution accompanying the quick
decline is possible, as suggested by Fan et al. in 2008. Time-resolved

investigated using the particle-number conserving (PNC) formalism for the
cranked shell model, in which the blocking effects are treated exactly. Both
rotational frequency $\omega$-dependence and seniority (number of unpaired
particles) $\nu$-dependence of the pairing gap $\tilde{\Delta}$ are
investigated. For the ground-state bands of even-even nuclei, PNC calculations
show that in general $\tilde{\Delta}$ decreases with increasing $\omega$, but
the $\omega$-dependence is much weaker than that calculated by the
number-projected Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov approach. For the multiquasiparticle
bands (seniority $\nu> 2$), the pairing gaps keep almost $\omega$-independent.
As a function of the seniority $\nu$, the bandhead pairing gaps
$\tilde{\Delta}(\nu,\omega=0)$ decrease slowly with increasing $\nu$. Even for
the highest seniority $\nu$ bands identified so far,
$\tilde{\Delta}(\nu,\omega=0)$ remains greater than 70% of
$\tilde{\Delta}(\nu=0,\omega=0)$.

""Forward-Lasso Adaptive SHrinkage"" (FLASH), which includes the Lasso and
Forward Selection as special cases, and can be used in both the linear
regression and the Generalized Linear Model domains. As with the Lasso and
Forward Selection, FLASH iteratively adds one variable to the model in a
hierarchical fashion but, unlike these methods, at each step adjusts the level
of shrinkage so as to optimize the selection of the next variable. We first
present FLASH in the linear regression setting and show that it can be fitted
using a variant of the computationally efficient LARS algorithm. Then, we
extend FLASH to the GLM domain and demonstrate, through numerous simulations
and real world data sets, as well as some theoretical analysis, that FLASH
generally outperforms many competing approaches.

and behavioral sciences. In general, a feature of random effects logistic
regression models for longitudinal binary data is that the marginal functional
form, when integrated over the distribution of the random effects, is no longer
of logistic form. Recently, Wang and Louis [Biometrika 90 (2003) 765--775]
proposed a random intercept model in the clustered binary data setting where
the marginal model has a logistic form. An acknowledged limitation of their
model is that it allows only a single random effect that varies from cluster to
cluster. In this paper we propose a modification of their model to handle
longitudinal data, allowing separate, but correlated, random intercepts at each
measurement occasion. The proposed model allows for a flexible correlation
structure among the random intercepts, where the correlations can be
interpreted in terms of Kendall's $\tau$. For example, the marginal
correlations among the repeated binary outcomes can decline with increasing
time separation, while the model retains the property of having matching
conditional and marginal logit link functions. Finally, the proposed method is
used to analyze data from a longitudinal study designed to monitor cardiac
abnormalities in children born to HIV-infected women.

introduce the notion of renormalization point $\mu$ to the subtractive

renormalization group equation generally becomes inhomogeneous but it is
transformed to be homogeneous. The renormalized scalar mass consists of two

other which is proportional to the renormalization scale $\mu$. This scheme
interpolates between the theory defined by dimensional regularization and the

variable selection in linear models. The method consists of two major steps. In
step 1, the lasso method is applied to many bootstrap samples, each using a set
of randomly selected covariates. A measure of importance is yielded from this
step for each covariate. In step 2, a similar procedure to the first step is
implemented with the exception that for each bootstrap sample, a subset of
covariates is randomly selected with unequal selection probabilities determined
by the covariates' importance. Adaptive lasso may be used in the second step
with weights determined by the importance measures. The final set of covariates
and their coefficients are determined by averaging bootstrap results obtained
from step 2. The proposed method alleviates some of the limitations of lasso,
elastic-net and related methods noted especially in the context of microarray
data analysis: it tends to remove highly correlated variables altogether or
select them all, and maintains maximal flexibility in estimating their
coefficients, particularly with different signs; the number of selected
variables is no longer limited by the sample size; and the resulting prediction
accuracy is competitive or superior compared to the alternatives. We illustrate
the proposed method by extensive simulation studies. The proposed method is
also applied to a Glioblastoma microarray data analysis.

As a test case we consider the evolution of a single black hole in numerical
general relativity. A natural strategy would be the expansion in tensor
spherical harmonics in spherical coordinates. Instead, we consider the simpler
and potentially more efficient possibility of a double Fourier expansion on the
sphere for tensors in Cartesian coordinates. As usual for the double Fourier
method, we employ a filter to address time-step limitations and certain
stability issues. We find that a tensor filter based on spin-weighted spherical
harmonics is successful, while two simplified, non-spin-weighted filters do not
lead to stable evolutions. The derivatives and the filter are implemented by
matrix multiplication for efficiency. A key technical point is the construction
of a matrix multiplication method for the spin-weighted spherical harmonic
filter. As example for the efficient parallelization of the double Fourier,
spin-weighted filter method we discuss an implementation on a GPU, which
achieves a speed-up of up to a factor of 20 compared to a single core CPU

using Density Functional Theory(DFT). The model gives a semi-quantitatively
accurate description of both the vapor-liquid-solid phase diagram for both
simple fluids (Lennard-Jones interactions) and of the
low-density/high-density/crystal phase diagram for model globular proteins (ten
Wolde-Frenkel interaction). The density profile is characterized by two local
order parameters, the average density and the crystallinity. The bulk free
energy model is supplemented by squared-derivative terms in these order
parameters to account for inhomogeneities thus producing a model similar in
spirit to phase-field theory. It is shown that for both interaction models, the
vapor-crystal part of the phase-diagram can be separated into regions for which
metastable liquid phases are more or less stable than the vapor, but always
less stable than the solid. The former case allows for the possibility of
\emph{double nucleation} whereby liquid droplets nucleate from the vapor
followed by a separate nucleation of the solid phase within the liquid
droplets. Whether or not this actually occurs depends on the relative free
energy barriers for vapor-solid and vapor-liquid nucleation and it is shown
that for simple fluids, double nucleation is indeed favored at sufficiently
large supersaturation. Finally, by studying the minimum free energy path from
the vapor to the solid, the separate possibility of \emph{transient
nucleation}, where the vapor-solid transition involves a single nucleation
event but the sub-critical clusters tend to be liquid-like while small, is
shown to also be possible when the metastable liquid exists, but the
supersaturation is too small for double nucleation.

{\tau} ~ {\tau}0, where {\tau}is liquid relaxation time and {\tau}0 is the

stiffness of a liquid at all available frequencies, and consequently to the
qualitative change of many important liquid properties. We analyze the dynamic
line theoretically as well as in real and model liquids, and show that the
transition corresponds to the disappearance of high-frequency sound,
qualitative changes of diffusion and viscous flow, increase of particle thermal
speed to half of the speed of sound and reduction of the constant volume
specific heat to 2kB per particle. In contrast to the Widom line that exists
near the critical point only, the new dynamic line is universal: it separates
two liquid states at arbitrarily high pressure and temperature, and exists in
systems where liquid - gas transition and the critical point are absent
overall.

The Guruswami-Sudan (GS) list decoder can be considered as state of the art in
algebraic decoding of RS codes. Besides an erasure option, it allows to adjust

which allow to optimally (in terms of residual codeword error probability)

one-component model, but it can be fitted with a thermal component (black body
or disc black body) plus power-law model affected by absorption. Therefore, the
softening of the X-ray spectrum with decreasing X-ray luminosity might be due
to a change in photon index or alternatively it might be due to a change in the
properties of the soft component. Assuming that the system is an X-ray binary,
we estimated a long-term time-averaged mass accretion rate of ~ 7.7E-13

T_f$, $\log T_m \propto -\rho^{2/3}$, where $\rho$ is the number density, which
is consistent with Stillinger's conjecture. Thermodynamic quantities such as
the energy and pressure and the structural functions such as the static
structure factor are also investigated in the fluid phase for a wide range of
temperature above the phase boundary. We compare the numerical results with the
prediction of the liquid theory with the random phase approximation (RPA). At
high temperatures, the results are in almost perfect agreement with RPA for a
wide range of density, as it has been already shown in the previous studies. In
the low temperature regime close to the phase boundary line, although RPA fails
to describe the structure factors and the radial distribution functions at the
length scales of the interparticle distance, it successfully predicts their
behaviors at shorter length scales. RPA also predicts thermodynamic quantities
such as the energy, pressure, and the temperature at which the thermal
expansion coefficient becomes negative, almost perfectly. Striking ability of
RPA to predict thermodynamic quantities even at high densities and low
temperatures is understood in terms of the decoupling of the length scales
which dictate thermodynamic quantities from the interparticle distance which

rotational Doppler beaming during eclipse ingress and egress when only part of

Inclusion of the rotational Doppler beaming in eclipsing systems is a

phenomenon with delay. For the latter case, however, we can not achieve a

interesting synchronization transition with time delay from zigzag fronts of
excitations to dynamic clustering anti-phase synchronization (APS), and further
to clustered chimera states which have spatially distributed anti-phase
coherence separated by incoherence. Furthermore, we also show how these

theories. The poor convergence of quantum field theory at finite temperature
has been the main obstacle in the practical applications of thermal QCD for
decades. In this dissertation I apply hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory,
which is a gauge-invariant reorganization of the conventional perturbative
expansion for quantum gauge theories to the thermodynamics of QED and
Yang-Mills theory to three-loop order. For the Abelian case, I present a
calculation of the free energy of a hot gas of electrons and photons by
expanding in a power series in $m_D/T$, $m_f/T$ and $e^2$, where $m_D$ and
$m_f$ are the photon and electron thermal masses, respectively, and $e$ is the
coupling constant. I demonstrate that the hard-thermal-loop perturbation
reorganization improves the convergence of the successive approximations to the
QED free energy at large coupling, $e \sim 2$. For the non-Abelian case, I
present a calculation of the free energy of a hot gas of gluons by expanding in
a power series in $m_D/T$ and $g^2$, where $m_D$ is the gluon thermal mass and
$g$ is the coupling constant. I show that at three-loop order hard-thermal-loop
perturbation theory is compatible with lattice results for the pressure, energy
density, and entropy down to temperatures $T \sim 2-3\;T_c$. The results
suggest that HTLpt provides a systematic framework that can be used to
calculate static and dynamic quantities for temperatures relevant at LHC.

local phase angle of the complex order parameter is continuously twisted

quantum phase is an interaction-induced admixture of the p-orbital favored by
the graphene-like band structure of the hexagonal optical lattice used in the

accompanied by a symmetry breaking in momentum space. The experimental results

predictor of the effectiveness of ARV treatment, but an appropriate determinant
of adherence rate based on medication event monitoring system (MEMS) data is
critical to predict virologic outcomes. The primary objective of this paper is
to investigate the effects of a number of summary determinants of MEMS
adherence rates on virologic response measured repeatedly over time in

model with consideration of drug adherence, interacted by virus susceptibility
to drug and baseline characteristics, to characterize the long-term virologic
responses after initiation of therapy. This model fully integrates viral load,
MEMS adherence, drug resistance and baseline covariates into the data analysis.
In this study we employed the proposed model and associated Bayesian nonlinear

adherence data for prediction of virologic response, and to evaluate the
predicting power of each summary metric of the MEMS adherence rates.

captured in a single mode, compared to the two modes needed by previous

years due to the ever increasing need for manufacturers to build robust systems

analyst to minimize some cost function while ensuring some minimal performances
cast as admissible failure probabilities for a set of performance functions. In
order to address real-world engineering problems in which the performance is
assessed through computational models (e.g., finite element models in
structural mechanics) metamodeling techniques have been developed in the past
decade. This paper introduces adaptive Kriging surrogate models to solve the
RBDO problem. The latter is cast in an augmented space that ""sums up"" the range
of the design space and the aleatory uncertainty in the design parameters and
the environmental conditions. The surrogate model is used (i) for evaluating
robust estimates of the failure probabilities (and for enhancing the
computational experimental design by adaptive sampling) in order to achieve the
requested accuracy and (ii) for applying a gradient-based optimization
algorithm to get optimal values of the design parameters. The approach is
applied to the optimal design of ring-stiffened cylindrical shells used in
submarine engineering under uncertain geometric imperfections. For this
application the performance of the structure is related to buckling which is
addressed here by means of a finite element solution based on the asymptotic

Cyg, at a distance of 10.5 - 14 kpc, is likely to be a recurrent nova of the U
Sco-class; containing a sub-giant secondary and an accretion disk, rather than
accretion directly onto the poles. We show that there is little evidence, at
quiescence, supporting a ~ 0.1 day periodicity, the variation seen at this
stage is likely caused by flickering of a re-established accretion disk. We
propose that the periodicity seen shortly after outburst is more likely related
to the outburst rather than the - then obscured - binary system. Finally we
address the distance to the system, and show that a significantly lower
distance (~ 2 kpc) would result in a severely under-luminous outburst, and as
such favour the larger distance and the recurrent nova scenario.

with the local softness, which integrates to the softness. It has also been
shown recently that with the conventional formulae, the largest values of local
hardness do not necessarily correspond to the hardest regions of a molecule.
Here, in an attempt to fix these drawbacks, we propose a new approach to define
and evaluate the local hardness. We define a local chemical potential,
utilizing the fact that the chemical potential emerges as the additive constant
term in the number-conserving functional derivative of the energy density
functional. Then, differentiation of this local chemical potential with respect
to the number of electrons leads to a local hardness that integrates to the
hardness, and possesses a favourable property; namely, within any given
electron system, it is in a local inverse relation with the Fukui function,
which is known to be a proper indicator of local softness in the case of soft
systems. Numerical tests for a few selected molecules and a detailed analysis,
comparing the new definition of local hardness with the previous ones, show
promising results.

In this scenario, the primordial singularity, one of the major shortcomings of
inflation, is replaced by a non-singular bounce, prior to which the universe
undergoes a phase of contraction. Our starting point is the bouncing cosmology
investigated in Falciano et al. (2008), which we complete by a detailed study
of the transfer of cosmological perturbations through the bounce and a
discussion of possible observational effects of bouncing cosmologies. We focus
on a symmetric bounce and compute the evolution of cosmological perturbations
during the contracting, bouncing and inflationary phases. We derive an
expression for the Mukhanov-Sasaki perturbation variable at the onset of the
inflationary phase that follows the bounce. Rather than being in the
Bunch-Davies vacuum, it is found to be in an excited state that depends on the
time scale of the bounce. We then show that this induces oscillations
superimposed on the nearly scale-invariant primordial spectra for scalar and
tensor perturbations. We discuss the effects of these oscillations in the
cosmic microwave background and in the matter power spectrum. We propose a new
way to indirectly measure the spatial curvature energy density parameter in the
context of this model.

primary and secondary users can coexist at the same time and frequency bands,
under the constraint that the rate of the primary user (PU) must remain the
same with a single-user decoder. To meet such a coexistence constraint, the
relaying from the secondary user (SU) can help the PU's transmission under the
interference from the SU. However, the relayed signal in the known dirty paper
coding (DPC) based scheme is interfered by the SU's signal, and is not ""clean"".
In this paper, under the half-duplex constraints, we propose two new
transmission schemes aided by the clean relaying from the SU's transmitter and
receiver without interference from the SU. We name them as the clean
transmitter relaying (CT) and clean transmitter-receiver relaying (CTR) aided
cognitive radio, respectively. The rate and multiplexing gain performances of
CT and CTR in fading channels with various availabilities of the channel state
information at the transmitters (CSIT) are studied. Our CT generalizes the
celebrated DPC based scheme proposed previously. With full CSIT, the
multiplexing gain of the CTR is proved to be better (or no less) than that of
the previous DPC based schemes. This is because the silent period for decoding
the PU's messages for the DPC may not be necessary in the CTR. With only the
statistics of CSIT, we further prove that the CTR outperforms the rate
performance of the previous scheme in fast Rayleigh fading channels. The
numerical examples also show that in a large class of channels, the proposed CT
and CTR provide significant rate gains over the previous scheme with small
complexity penalties.

notions of charge: Page, Maxwell, and brane. The orbifolds admit discrete
torsion, and we describe the associated quantum numbers which are consistent
with the geometry in its large radius and small radius limits from both the
type IIA and the M-theory perspectives. The discrete torsion, measured by a
Page charge, is related to the number of fractional branes. We relate the
shifts in the Page charges under large gauge transformations to the
Hanany-Witten brane creation effect.

with a 1:1 stoichiometry, using NbF5 and Si2H6 as precursors. The growth
mechanism at 200oC was examined by in-situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
and quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). This study revealed a self-limiting
reaction with a growth rate of 4.5 {\AA}/cycle. NbSi was found to grow only on
oxide-free films prepared using halogenated precursors. The electronic
properties, growth rate, chemical composition, and structure of the films were
studied over the deposition temperature range 150-400oC. For all temperatures,
the films are found to be stoichiometric NbSi (1:1) with no detectable fluorine
impurities, amorphous with a density of 6.65g/cm3, and metallic with a
resistivity {\rho}=150 {\mu}{\Omega}.cm at 300K for films thicker than 35 nm.
The growth rate was nearly constant for deposition temperatures between
150-275oC, but increases above 300oC suggesting the onset of non-self limiting
growth. The electronic properties of the films were measured down to 1.2K and
revealed a superconducting transition at Tc=3.1K. To our knowledge, a
superconducting niobium silicide film with a 1:1 stoichiometry has never been
grown before by any technique.

view of a possible transistor function as well as spintronics applications in

account the monatomic thickness of graphene, we derive Hermitian wave equations
and infer phonon creation and annihilation operators. We elaborate on two types
of boundary configuration, which we believe can be realized in experiment: (i)
fixed and (ii) free boundaries. The former leads to a gapped phonon dispersion
relation, which is beneficial for high electron mobilites and long spin
lifetimes. The latter exhibits an ungapped dispersion and a finite sound
velocity of out-of-plane modes at the center of the Brillouin zone. In the
limit of negligible boundary effects, bulk-like behavior is restored. We also
discuss the deformation potential, which in some cases gives the dominant
contribution to the spin relaxation rate T_1^{-1}.

presence of a time dependent external magnetic field h(t) at zero and finite
temperatures. We consider different forms of time dependence for the coupling
and magnetic field; exponential, hyperbolic and periodic. We examined the
system size effect on the entanglement asymptotic value. It was found that for
a small system size the entanglement starts to fluctuate within a short period
of time after applying the time dependent coupling. The period of time
increases as the system size increases and disappears completely as the size
goes to infinity. We also found that when J(t) is periodic the entanglement
shows a periodic behavior with the same period, which disappears upon applying
periodic magnetic field with the same frequency. Solving the particular case
where J(t) and h(t) are proportional exactly, we showed that the asymptotic
value of entanglement depends only on the initial conditions regardless of the
form of J(t) and h(t) applied at t > 0.

unfixed. Further, some of the Yukawa couplings needed to generated quark and
lepton masses are forbidden by a residual global symmetry of the model. In this
paper we study the stabilisation of moduli using background fluxes, and show
that the moduli may be stabilised within the Kahler cone. In principle, missing
Yukawa couplings may be restored, albeit with a coupling that is suppressed by
non-perturbative effects, by the use Euclidean D2-branes that are pointlike in
spacetime, i.e. E2-instantons. However, for the models under investigation, we
show that this is not possible.

well-established finite-size scaling techniques and concepts from the scaling

index-of-refraction or permittivity wave variation through a medium. But
adjacent material planes of alternating permittivity should interact due to the
zero-point (ZP) field to produce internal forces, roughly like the Casimir
effect in a stack of regularly spaced discrete conducting plates. The ZP force
in a smoothly varying 1D permittivity wave is modeled and found to consist
mainly of bulk repulsive and double-wavenumber harmonics. It is stronger than
the Casimir ZP attractive force in the corresponding discrete alternating-layer
stack at all physically meaningful repetition scales, extends to larger scales,
falling off universally only as the inverse square of the wavelength, and shows
no temperature sensitivity. Thus, at its extremes, a standing acoustic wave
exhibits a bulk expansive ZP pressure through the material volume, but as it
passes through its null the ZP pressure vanishes, giving a body stress
modulated at twice the acoustic wave frequency. But such repeated tensing in a
piezo material is a usual energy-harvesting scenario, suggesting that ZP energy
transfer may occur naturally with standing acoustic waves in a piezo medium. A
voltage effect is predicted for biphonon lattice vibrations in piezo crystals
with the possibility of 'crystal power', the extraction of electrical ZP energy
across the crystal volume.
