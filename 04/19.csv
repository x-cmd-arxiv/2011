elucidate which object class is the best target for gamma-ray DM searches with
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). We have built a mixed
dwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarf
galaxies (Draco, Ursa Minor, Wilman 1 and Segue 1) and local galaxy clusters
(Perseus, Coma, Ophiuchus, Virgo, Fornax, NGC5813 and NGC5846), and then
compute their DM annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latest
modeling of their DM density profiles. We also include in our calculations the
effect of DM substructure. Willman 1 appears as the best candidate in the
sample. However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other
candidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor
and Segue 1, might be better options. As for galaxy clusters, Virgo represents
the one with the highest flux. However, its large spatial extension can be a
serious handicap for IACT observations and posterior data analysis. Yet, other
local galaxy cluster candidates with more moderate emission regions, such as
Perseus, may represent good alternatives. After comparing dwarfs and clusters,
we found that the former exhibit annihilation flux profiles that, at the
center, are roughly one order of magnitude higher than those of clusters,
although galaxy clusters can yield similar, or even higher, integrated fluxes
for the whole object once substructure is taken into account. Even when any of
these objects are strictly point-like according to the properties of their
annihilation signals, we conclude that dwarf galaxies are best suited for
observational strategies based on the search of point-like sources, while
galaxy clusters represent best targets for analyses that can deal with rather
extended emissions. Finally, we study the detection prospects for IACTs

science run. Energy and spatial distributions agree with those predicted by
component-level Monte Carlo simulations propagating the effects of the
radiological contamination measured for materials employed in the experiment.
Neutron elastic scattering is predicted to yield 3.05$\pm$0.5 nuclear recoils
with energy 5-50 keV per year, which translates to an expectation of 0.4 events

the context of future experiments. These include contamination of scintillation
pulses with Cherenkov light from Compton electrons and from $\beta$ activity
internal to photomultipliers, which can increase the size and lower the
apparent time constant of the scintillation response. Another challenge is
posed by multiple-scatter $\gamma$-rays with one or more vertices in regions
that yield no ionisation. If the discrimination power achieved in the first run

uncertainty, which is one of two sources of velocity errors studied here. The
other source of error is particle acceleration, which has the opposite trend of
diminishing at higher frame rates. Both kinds of errors can propagate into
quantities calculated from velocity, such as the kinetic temperature of
particles or correlation functions. As demonstrated in a dusty plasma
experiment, the kinetic temperature of particles has no unique value when
measured using PTV, but depends on the sampling time interval or frame rate. It
is also shown that an artifact appears in an autocorrelation function computed

extension of the concept of Kan extension to the cones and we prove that
limiting cones create Kan extensions. The latter topic focuses on two
significant families of concrete categories over an arbitrary category. Beck
categories are defined by preservance properties while newly introduced
l-algebraic categories are described by limits of categories of functor
algebras. The latter family is shown to be rather natural.
  The well known Beck's theorem states that the monadic categories are
precisely the Beck categories with free objects. We strengthen this theorem by
weakening the assumptions of the existence of free objects and we replace it by
existence of some Kan extensions, namely the pointwise codensity monads.
Moreover, using the result on Kan extensions of cones we show that for
l-algebraic categories even weaker assumption fits.

Edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies
with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals with
disky isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of
bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are
generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical
galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it
gives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the
kinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to
replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than
using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density
environments [f(SR)<2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR)~4%] of
the total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with
the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR)~20%]. We find a
clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the
local galaxy surface density. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma
relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as
main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in
low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local
effects at the small-group scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo
core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while the
fraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that
a different mechanism is at work there. (Abridged)

density $\rho_c(h_0)$, the system changes its behavior sharply and relaxes

incorporates the growth and feedback of supermassive black holes and the
physics of galaxy formation, we examine the effects of environmental factors
(e.g., local gas density, black hole feedback) on the halo occupation
distribution of low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN). We decompose the
mean occupation function into central and satellite contribution and compute
the conditional luminosity functions (CLF). The CLF of the central AGN follows
a log-normal distribution with the mean increasing and scatter decreasing with
increasing redshifts. We analyze the light curves of individual AGN and show
that the peak luminosity of the AGN has a tighter correlation with halo mass
compared to instantaneous luminosity. We also compute the CLF of satellite AGN
at a given central AGN luminosity. We do not see any significant correlation
between the number of satellites with the luminosity of the central AGN at a
fixed halo mass. We also show that for a sample of AGN with luminosity above
10^42 ergs/s the mean occupation function can be modeled as a softened step
function for central AGN and a power law for the satellite population. The
radial distribution of AGN inside halos follows a power law at all redshifts
with a mean index of -2.33 +/- 0.08. Incorporating the environmental dependence
of supermassive black hole accretion and feedback, our formalism provides a
theoretical tool for interpreting current and future measurements of AGN
clustering.

radio loud quasar PKS 0528+134 in quiescence during the period July to December
2009. Significant flux variability on a time scale of several hours was found
in the optical regime, accompanied by a weak trend of spectral softening with
increasing flux. We suggest that this might be the signature of a contribution
from the accretion disk at the blue end of the optical spectrum. The optical
flux is weakly polarized with rapid variations of the degree and direction of
polarization, while the polarization of the 43 GHz radio core remains steady.
Optical spectropolarimetry suggests a trend of increasing degree of
polarization with increasing wavelength, providing additional evidence for an
accretion disc contribution towards the blue end of the optical spectrum. We
constructed four SEDs indicating that even in the quiescent state, the
bolometric luminosity of PKS 0528+134 is dominated by its gamma-ray emission. A
leptonic single-zone jet model produced acceptable fits to the SEDs with
contributions to the high-energy emission from synchrotron self-Compton
radiation and Comptonization of direct accretion disk emission. Fit parameters
close to equipartition were obtained. The moderate variability on long time
scales implies the existence of on-going particle acceleration, while the
observed optical polarization variability seems to point towards a turbulent
acceleration process. Turbulent particle acceleration at stationary features
along the jet therefore appears to be a viable possibility for the quiescent
state of PKS 0528+134.

basic properties of the electromagnetic field in graphene must be explored.
Here we report on the fields radiated by a nanoemitter lying on a graphene
sheet. Our results show that this field presents a rich dependence on both
frequency, distance to the source and dipole orientation. This behavior is
attributed to distinct peculiarities on the density of electromagnetic states
in the graphene sheet and the interaction between them. The field is mainly
composed of an core region of high-intensity electromagnetic field, dominated
by surface plasmons, and an outer region where the field is practically the
same it would be for an emitter in vacuum. Within the core region, the
intensity of the electric field is several orders of magnitude larger than what
it would be in vacuum. Importantly, the size of this core region can be
controlled thorough external gates, which opens up many interesting
applications in, for instance, surface optics and spectroscopy. Additionally,
the large coupling between nanoemitters and surface plasmons makes graphene
sheets a propitious stage for quantum-optics, in which the interaction between
quantum objects could be externally tailored at will.

biochemical product or phenotypic adaptation. In this paper, it will be shown
that a principle of ""maximum intermediate steps"" may also characterize complex
biological systems, especially those in which extreme historical contingency or
a combination of mutation and recombination are key features. The contribution
to existing literature is two-fold: demonstrating both the potential for
non-optimality in engineered systems with ""lifelike"" attributes, and the
underpinnings of non-optimality in naturalistic contexts.
  This will be demonstrated by using the Rube Goldberg Machine (RGM) analogy.
Mechanical RGMs will be introduced, and their relationship to conceptual
biological RGMs. Exemplars of these biological RGMs and their evolution (e.g.
introduction of mutations and recombination-like inversions) will be
demonstrated using block diagrams and interconnections with complex networks
(called convolution architectures). The conceptual biological RGM will then be
mapped to an artificial vascular system, which can be modeled using
microfluidic-like structures. Theoretical expectations will be presented,
particularly regarding whether or not maximum intermediate steps equates to the
rescue or reuse of traits compromised by previous mutations or inversions.
Considerations for future work and applications will then be discussed,

form. The mesh generating points are free to move with arbitrary velocity, with
the choice of zero velocity resulting in an Eulerian formulation. Moving the
points at the local fluid velocity makes the formulation effectively
Lagrangian. We have written the TESS code to solve the equations of
compressible hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics for both relativistic and

TESS is significantly less diffusive than fixed mesh codes and thus preserves
contact discontinuities to high precision while also accurately capturing
strong shock waves. TESS is written for Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical
coordinates and is modular so that auxilliary physics solvers are readily
integrated into the TESS framework and so that the TESS framework can be
readily adapted to solve general systems of equations. We present results from

coalescing binary BH systems, we estimate the resulting stochastic GW
background signal. Assuming average quantities for the single source energy
emissions, we explore the parameter space of chirp mass and local rate density
required for detection by advanced and third generation interferometric GW
detectors. For an average chirp mass of 8.7$M_{\odot}$, we find that detection
through 3 years of cross-correlation by two advanced detectors will require a
rate density, $r_0 \geq 0.5 \rm{Mpc}^{-3} \rm{Myr}^{-1}$. Combining data from
multiple pairs of detectors can reduce this limit by up to 40%. Investigating
the full parameter space we find that detection could be achieved at rates $r_0

systems with average chirp masses of $\sim 15M_{\odot}$ which are predicted by

high end of theoretical estimates, cross-correlation of data by two Einstein
Telescopes could detect this signal under the condition $r_0 \geq 10^{-3}

describe an infinite parameter family of analytic solutions for closed Wilson
loops. The solutions are given in terms of Riemann theta functions and the
validity of the equations of motion is proven based on the trisecant identity.
The world-sheet has the topology of a disk and the renormalized area is written
as a finite, one-dimensional contour integral over the world-sheet boundary. An
example is discussed in detail with plots of the corresponding surfaces.
Further, for each Wilson loops we explicitly construct a one parameter family
of deformations that preserve the area. The parameter is the so called spectral

Energy Assessment (SEA), identifies the natural boundaries of businesses as
self-managing net-energy systems, of controlled and self-managing parts. The
method is demonstrated using a model Wind Farm case study, and applied to
defining a true physical measure of its energy productivity for society
(EROI-S), the global ratio of energy produced to energy cost. The traceable
needs of business technology are combined with assignable energy needs for all
other operating services. That serves to correct a large natural gap in energy
use information. Current methods count traceable energy receipts for technology
use. Self-managing services employed by businesses outsource their own energy
needs to operate, and leave no records to trace. Those uncounted energy demands
are often 80% of the total embodied energy of business end products. The scale
of this ""dark energy"" was discovered from differing global accounts, and
corrected so the average energy cost per dollar for businesses would equal the
world average energy use per dollar of GDP. Presently the energy needs of paid
services that outsource their own energy needs are counted for lack of
information to be ""0"". Our default assumption is to treat them as ""average"".
The result is to assign total energy use and impacts to the demand for energy
services, for a ""Scope 4"" GHG assessment level. Counting only the energy uses
of technology understates the energy needs of business services, as if services
were more energy efficient than technology. The result confirms a similar
finding by Hall et. al. in 1981 [9]. We use exhaustive search for what a
business needs to operate as a whole, locating a natural physical boundary for
its working parts, to define businesses as physical rather than statistical

Similar control is difficult to achieve with radio frequency or microwave

protoplanetary disks and Solar System bodies can shed light on the progress of
planet formation. The significant fraction of crystalline material in comets,
chondritic meteorites and interplanetary dust particles indicates a
modification of the almost completely amorphous ISM dust from which they
formed. The production of crystalline silicates thus must happen in
protoplanetary disks, where dust evolves to build planets and planetesimals.
Different scenarios have been proposed, but it is still unclear how and when
this happens. This paper presents dust grain mineralogy of a complete sample of
protoplanetary disks in the young Serpens cluster. These results are compared
to those in the young Taurus region and to sources that have retained their
protoplanetary disks in the older Upper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis stellar
clusters, using the same analysis technique for all samples. This comparison
allows an investigation of the grain mineralogy evolution with time for a total
sample of 139 disks. The mean cluster age and disk fraction are used as
indicators of the evolutionary stage of the different populations. Our results
show that the disks in the different regions have similar distributions of mean
grain sizes and crystallinity fractions (~10-20%) despite the spread in mean
ages. Furthermore, there is no evidence of preferential grain sizes for any
given disk geometry, nor for the mean cluster crystallinity fraction to
increase with mean age in the 1-8 Myr range. The main implication is that a
modest level of crystallinity is established in the disk surface early on (< 1
Myr), reaching a equilibrium that is independent of what may be happening in
the disk midplane. These results are discussed in the context of planet
formation, in comparison with mineralogical results from small bodies in our
Solar System. [Abridged]

between emission line properties, radio luminosity, radio spectral slopes and
X-ray luminosity, as well as more complex multi-variate relations involving
black hole mass, such as the fundamental plane of black hole activity. We find
that 15 out of 17 sources of our sample can be classified as Low-Excitation

to originate from the jet basis. We also find that X-ray emission does not

jet-power estimator. More generally, X-ray, radio and optical emission appear
to be related, although no tight correlation is found. In accordance with a

explained by a lack of cold (molecular) gaseous structures in the innermost

it can be ultraviolet-completed in the context of Horava gravity. We discuss
the observational predictions of the model. Even in the absence of a

essentially indistinguishable from that of Lambda-CDM. The difference between
the two theories appears at the level of cosmological perturbations. We find
that in Theta-CDM the matter power spectrum is enhanced at subhorizon scales

donors is essential for identifying hydrogen storage materials for vehicular
applications that can be regenerated by off-board methods; however, almost no
thermodynamic data are available to make this assessment. To fill this gap, we
employed the G4(MP2) method to determine heats of formation, entropies, and
Gibbs free energies of formation for thirty-eight alane complexes with NH3-nRn
(R = Me, Et; n = 0-3), pyridine, pyrazine, triethylenediamine (TEDA),
quinuclidine, OH2-nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0-2), dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran
(THF). Monomer, bis, and selected dimer complex geometries were considered.
Using these data, we computed the thermodynamics of the key formation and
dehydrogenation reactions that would occur during hydrogen delivery and alane
regeneration, from which trends in complex stability were identified. These
predictions were tested by synthesizing six amine-alane complexes involving
trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylethylamine, TEDA, quinuclidine, and
hexamine, and obtaining upper limits of delta G for their formation from
metallic aluminum. Combining these computational and experimental results, we
establish a criterion for complex stability relevant to hydrogen storage that
can be used to assess potential ligands prior to attempting synthesis of the
alane complex. Based on this, we conclude that only a subset of the tertiary
amine complexes considered and none of the ether complexes can be successfully
formed by direct reaction with aluminum and regenerated in an alane-based

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201116841",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The UV escape fraction from high-redshift galaxies plays a key role in models
of cosmic reionisation. Because it is currently not possible to deduce the
escape fractions during the epoch of reionisation from observations, we have to
rely on numerical simulations. Our aim is to better constrain the escape
fraction from high-redshift dwarf galaxies, as these are the most likely
sources responsible for reionising the Universe. We employ a N-body/SPH method
that includes realistic prescriptions for the physical processes that are
important for the evolution of dwarf galaxies. These models are post-processed
with radiative transfer to determine the escape fraction of ionising radiation.
We perform a parameter study to assess the influence of the spin parameter, gas
fraction and formation redshift of the galaxy and study the importance of
numerical parameters as resolution, source distribution and local gas clearing.
We find that the UV escape fraction from high-redshift dwarf galaxies that have
formed a rotationally supported disc lie between 1e-5 and 0.1. The mass and
angular momentum of the galaxy are the most important parameters that determine
the escape fraction. We compare our results to previous work and discuss the
uncertainties of our models. The low escape fraction we find for high-redshift
dwarf galaxies is balanced by their high stellar content, resulting in an
efficiency parameter for stars that is only marginally lower than the values
found by semi-analytic models of reionisation. We therefore conclude that dwarf
galaxies play an important role in cosmic reionisation also after the initial
starburst phase, when the gas has settled into a disc.

clouds (MCs) we model the magnetic and topological properties of four large
eruptive solar flares and relate them to observations. We use the
three-dimensional Minimum Current Corona model \cite{Longcope1996d} and
observations of pre-flare photospheric magnetic field and flare ribbons to
derive values of reconnected magnetic flux, flare energy, flux rope helicity
and orientation of the flux rope poloidal field. We compare model predictions
of those quantities to flare and MC observations and within the estimated
uncertainties of the methods used find the following. The predicted model
reconnection fluxes are equal to or lower than the reconnection fluxes inferred
from the observed ribbon motions. Both observed and model reconnection fluxes
match the MC poloidal fluxes. The predicted flux rope helicities match the MC
helicities. The predicted free energies lie between the observed energies and
the estimated total flare luminosities. The direction of the leading edge of
the MC's poloidal field is aligned with the poloidal field of the flux rope in
the AR rather than the global dipole field. These findings compel us to believe
that magnetic clouds associated with these four solar flares are formed by
low-corona magnetic reconnection during the eruption, rather than eruption of
pre-existing structures in the corona or formation in the upper corona with
participation of the global magnetic field. We also note that since all four
flares occurred in active regions without significant pre-flare flux emergence
and cancellation, the energy and helicity we find are stored by shearing and
rotating motions, which are sufficient to account for the observed radiative
flare energy and MC helicity.

momentum transport become anisotropic with respect to the local magnetic field
direction. Anisotropic heat conduction causes the slow magnetosonic wave to
become buoyantly unstable to the magnetothermal instability (MTI) when the
temperature increases in the direction of gravity and to the heat-flux--driven
buoyancy instability (HBI) when the temperature decreases in the direction of
gravity. The local changes in magnetic field strength that attend these
instabilities cause pressure anisotropies that viscously damp motions parallel
to the magnetic field. In this paper we employ a linear stability analysis to
elucidate the effects of anisotropic viscosity (i.e. Braginskii pressure
anisotropy) on the MTI and HBI. By stifling the convergence/divergence of
magnetic field lines, pressure anisotropy significantly affects how the ICM
interacts with the temperature gradient. Instabilities which depend upon the
convergence/divergence of magnetic field lines to generate unstable buoyant
motions (the HBI) are suppressed over much of the wavenumber space, whereas
those which are otherwise impeded by field-line convergence/divergence (the
MTI) are strengthened. As a result, the wavenumbers at which the HBI survives
largely unsuppressed in the ICM have parallel components too small to
rigorously be considered local. This is particularly true as the magnetic field
becomes more and more orthogonal to the temperature gradient. In contrast, the
fastest-growing MTI modes are unaffected by anisotropic viscosity. However, we
find that anisotropic viscosity couples slow and Alfven waves in such a way as
to buoyantly destabilise Alfvenic fluctuations when the temperature increases
in the direction of gravity. Consequently, many wavenumbers previously
considered MTI-stable or slow-growing are in fact maximally unstable.

optically-thick LyA line. To define gas motions relative to the systemic
velocity of the blob, the LyA line must be compared with an optically-thin line
like Halpha, which is not much altered by radiative transfer effects. We obtain
optical and NIR spectra of the two brightest LyA blobs from Yang et al. sample
using the Magellan/MagE and VLT/SINFONI. Both the LyA and Halpha lines confirm
that these blobs lie at the survey redshift, z~2.3. Within each blob, we detect
several Halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in HST
images. The Halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internal
velocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (LAB01), their
velocity difference is ~440 km/s. The presence of multiple galaxies within the
blobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relative
motion, is consistent with our previous finding that LyA blobs inhabit massive
dark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.
To determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantly
infalling or outflowing, we compare the LyA and Halpha line centers, finding
that LyA is not offset (Delta LyA = +0km/s) in LAB01 and redshifted by only
+230 km/s in LAB02. These offsets are small compared to those of Lyman break
galaxies, which average +450 km/s and extend to about +700 km/s. We test and
rule out the simplest infall models and those outflow models with
super/hyper-winds, which require large outflow velocities. Because of the
unknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiple
sources of LyA emission embedded in the blobs, a larger sample and more
sophisticated models are required to test more complex or a wider range of
infall and outflow scenarios.

invariance of (joint) k- hyponormality under the action (h,\ell) ->
W_{(\alpha,\beta)}^{(h,\ell)}(T_1, T_2):=(T_1^k,T_2^{\ell}) (h,\ell >=1). We
show that for every k >= 1 there exists W_{(\alpha,\beta)}(T_1, T_2) such that
W_{(\alpha,\beta)}^{(h,\ell)}(T_1, T_2) is k-hyponormal (all h>=2,\ell>=1) but
W_{(\alpha,\beta)}(T_1, T_2) is not k-hyponormal. On the positive side, for a
class of 2-variable weighted shifts with tensor core we find a computable
necessary condition for invariance. Next, we exhibit a large nontrivial class
for which hyponormality is indeed invariant under all powers; moreover, for
this class 2-hyponormality automatically implies subnormality. Our results
partially depend on new formulas for the determinant of generalized Hilbert
matrices and on criteria for their positive semi-definiteness.

(2QZ cluster), a powerful, high-redshift radio galaxy (HzRG), and a
concentration of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) and optically faint radio
galaxies (OFRGs). In total, we detect 137 narrow-band emitter candidates down
to emission-line fluxes of 0.5-1 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2, across a total area
of 0.56 sq. degrees (2.1 x 10^5 comoving Mpc at z=2.23) in these fields. The
BzK colours of the emitters suggest that at least 80% of our sample are likely
to be H-alpha emitters (HAEs) at z=2.23. This is one of the largest HAE samples
known at z>2. We find modest (~3-sigma) local over-densities of emitters
associated with all the three targets. In the 2QZ cluster field, the emitters
show a striking filamentary structure connecting four of the z=2.23 QSOs
extending over 30Mpc (comoving). In the HzRG and SMG/OFRG fields, the
structures appear to be smaller and seen only in the vicinities of the targets.
The K-band magnitudes and the H-alpha equivalent widths of the emitters are
weakly correlated with the over-density of the emitters: emitters in over-dense
region are more evolved systems compared to those in under-dense regions at
z=2.23. We find several examples of extended HAEs in our target fields,
including a striking example with a spatial extent of 7.5 arcsec (60 kpc at
z=2.23) in the 2QZ field, suggesting that these are relatively common in
high-density regions. We conclude that narrow-band H-alpha surveys are
efficient routes to map over-dense regions at high-z and thus to understand the
relation between the growth of galaxies and their surrounding large-scale
structures.

and practice during the last years. Although many approaches address BPC, they
mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified base of process constraints
and focus on their verification over the business processes. However, it
remains unclear how such an inte- grated process constraint base can be built
up, even though this con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further
compliance checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
the success- ful IT support of BPC will not be possible. In this technical
report we introduce a unified representation framework that enables the
identifica- tion of process constraints from domain rules and their later
unification within a process constraint base. Separating process constraints
from domain rules can lead to significant reduction of compliance checking
effort. Unification enables consistency checks and optimizations as well as
maintenance and evolution of the constraint base on the other side.

terminations begin is approximately 90 +/- 90 degrees before the maxima in all

interactions between the three cycles and ice volume. Unlike previous ice
volume models, this model produces an orbitally driven increase in 100-kyr
power during the mid-Pleistocene transition without any change in model
parameters. This supports the hypothesis that Pleistocene variations in the
100-kyr power of glacial cycles could be caused, at least in part, by changes

Instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds that are hundreds of times higher
than the signal were carefully characterized and removed. We examine both
intracluster light plumes as well as the outer halo of the giant elliptical
M87. For two intracluster light plumes, we use optical colors to constrain
their ages to be greater than 3 & 5 Gyr, respectively. Upper limits on the IRAC
fluxes constrain the upper limits to the masses, and optical detections
constrain the lower limits to the masses. In this first measurement of mass of
intracluster light plumes we find masses in the range of 5.5 x 10^8 - 4.5 x
10^9 and 2.1 x 10^8 - 1.5 x 10^9 solar masses for the two plumes for which we
have coverage. Given their expected short lifetimes, and a constant production
rate for these types of streams, integrated over Virgo's lifetime, they can
account for the total ICL content of the cluster implying that we do not need
to invoke ICL formation mechanisms other than gravitational mechanisms leading
to bright plumes. We also examined the outer halo of the giant elliptical M87.
The color profile from the inner to outer halo of M87 (160 Kpc) is consistent
with either a flat or optically blue gradient, where a blue gradient could be
due to younger or lower metallicity stars at larger radii. The similarity of
the age predicted by both the infrared and optical colors (> few Gyr) indicates
that the optical measurements are not strongly affected by dust extinction.

colloquial terms, spatial frequencies are gradient histogram bins. Since the

numerical simulations to constrain a tidal event with an LMC like galaxy to
some dynamical times in the past or to a current very low mass, gas rich

charge, charge radius and electric dipole moment. Such connections can
constitute the paraleptons of axial-vector currents, for example, at the
interactions with field of spinless nuclei of true neutrality. We derive the
united equations which relate the structural parts of mass to anapole, charge
radius and electric dipole of any truly neutral lepton in the framework of
flavour symmetry. Thereby, they establish the C-odd nature of leptons and
fields at the level of constancy law of the size implied from the
multiplication of a weak mass of C-antisymmetrical lepton by its electric mass.
Therefore, all leptons of C-antisymmetricality regardless of the difference in
masses of an axial-vector character, have the same anapole with his radius as
well as an equal electric dipole. Their analysis together with measured value
of an electric dipole moment of lepton gives the right to interpret not only
the existence of truly neutral types of leptons and fields but also the
availability of mass structure in them as the one of earlier laboratory facts.

International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment is investigated. Such a light
gravitino is generally predicted in the low-scale gauge mediation scenario of
the supersymmetry breaking. We particularly focus on the case that the next
lightest supersymmetric particle is stau, which eventually decays into a
gravitino and a $\tau$-lepton. With such a small gravitino mass, the lifetime
of the stau is $10^{-15}$--$10^{-11}$sec, and the produced stau decays before
reaching the first layer of the inner detector of the ILC. It is shown,
however, that the lifetime can be determined from the distribution of the
impact parameter, which is obtained by observing charged tracks caused by decay
products of the $\tau$-lepton. This measurement also enables us to estimate the
mass of the gravitino and determine the scale of the supersymmetry breaking.
Based on a simulation study, we found that the lifetime can be measured when it
is longer than $\sim 10^{-14}$sec and the stau mass is about 100GeV.

Self-interactions of non-Abelian fields make the field perturbation

evolution of fields outside the horizon. In view of this we show that the
dominant contribution can be obtained from the homogeneous classical equation
of motion. Then we calculate the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation.
The anisotropy in spectrum is suppressed by the number of fields. This makes it
possible for vector fields to be responsible for the total curvature
perturbation in the Universe without violating observational bounds on
statistical anisotropy. The bispectrum of the curvature perturbation is also
anisotropic. Finally we give an example of the end-of-inflation scenario in
which the curvature perturbation is generated by vector gauge fields through
varying gauge coupling constant(s), which in covariant derivatives couples the
Higgs field to the vector fields. We find that reasonably large gauge groups

Unfortunately, the natural optimization problem to consider is concave but not

reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems that remains applicable
when the performance models are expensive to evaluate. Starting with the
premise that simulation-based approaches are not affordable for such problems,
and that the most-probable-failure-point-based approaches do not permit to
quantify the error on the estimation of the failure probability, an approach
based on both metamodels and advanced simulation techniques is explored. The
kriging metamodeling technique is chosen in order to surrogate the performance
functions because it allows one to genuinely quantify the surrogate error. The
surrogate error onto the limit-state surfaces is propagated to the failure
probabilities estimates in order to provide an empirical error measure. This
error is then sequentially reduced by means of a population-based adaptive
refinement technique until the kriging surrogates are accurate enough for
reliability analysis. This original refinement strategy makes it possible to
add several observations in the design of experiments at the same time.
Reliability and reliability sensitivity analyses are performed by means of the
subset simulation technique for the sake of numerical efficiency. The adaptive
surrogate-based strategy for reliability estimation is finally involved into a
classical gradient-based optimization algorithm in order to solve the RBDO
problem. The kriging surrogates are built in a so-called augmented reliability
space thus making them reusable from one nested RBDO iteration to the other.
The strategy is compared to other approaches available in the literature on

collide elastically in a finite volume. The dynamics consists of a sequence of
instantaneous binary collisions. We study how the numbers of collisions of
different pairs of particles grow as functions of time. We observe that these
numbers can be represented as a time-integral of a function on the phase space.
Assuming the results of the ergodic theory apply, we describe the evolution of
the numbers by an effective Langevin dynamics. We use the facts that hold for
these dynamics with probability one, in order to establish properties of a
single trajectory of the system. We find that for any triplet of particles
there will be an infinite sequence of moments of time, when the numbers of
collisions of all three different pairs of the triplet will be equal. Moreover,
any value of difference of collision numbers of pairs in the triplet will
repeat indefinitely. On the other hand, for larger number of pairs there is but
a finite number of repetitions. Thus the ergodic theory produces a limitation
on the dynamics.

(including several tens of OB stars). The HII LFs with L < 10^{37.1} erg/s are
found to have different slopes for different parts in M51: the HII LF for the

observed difference in HII LFs can be explained by evolutionary effects that
HII regions in the interarm region are relatively older than those in the other

1's, 29 Seyfert 1.5's, 78 Seyfert 2's, and 14 Narrow Line Seyfert 1's. We
derived the average hard X-ray spectrum of each subsample in the 17-250keV
energy range. All classes of Seyfert galaxies show on average the same nuclear
continuum, as foreseen by the zeroth order unified model, with a cut-off energy
of Ec>200keV, and a photon index of Gamma ~1.8. Compton-thin Seyfert 2's show a
reflection component stronger than Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 1.5's. Most of this
reflection is due to mildly obscured (10^23 cm^-2 < NH < 10^24 cm^-2) Seyfert
2's, which have a significantly stronger reflection component
(R=2.2^{+4.5}_{-1.1}) than Seyfert 1's (R<=0.4), Seyfert 1.5's (R<= 0.4) and
lightly obscured (NH < 10^23 cm^-2) Seyfert 2's (R<=0.5). This cannot be
explained easily by the unified model. The absorber/reflector in mildly
obscured Seyfert 2's might cover a large fraction of the X-ray source, and have
clumps of Compton-thick material. The large reflection found in the spectrum of
mildly obscured Seyfert 2's reduces the amount of Compton-thick objects needed
to explain the peak of the cosmic X-ray background. Our results are consistent
with the fraction of Compton-thick sources being ~10%. The spectra of Seyfert
2's with and without polarized broad lines do not show significant differences,
the only difference between the two samples being the higher hard X-ray and
bolometric luminosity of Seyfert 2's with polarized broad lines. The average
hard X-ray spectrum of Narrow line Seyfert 1's is steeper than those of Seyfert
1's and Seyfert 1.5's, probably due to a lower energy of the cutoff.

Parameterized Complexity. Examples include classical problems like Feedback
Vertex Set, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Chordal Deletion. Interestingly, the
study of edge contraction problems of this type from a parameterized
perspective has so far been left largely unexplored. We consider two basic edge
contraction problems, which we call Path-Contractibility and
Tree-Contractibility. Both problems take an undirected graph $G$ and an integer
$k$ as input, and the task is to determine whether we can obtain a path or an
acyclic graph, respectively, by contracting at most $k$ edges of $G$. Our main
contribution is an algorithm with running time $4^{k+O(\log^2 k)} + n^{O(1)}$
for Path-Contractibility and an algorithm with running time $4.88^k n^{O(1)}$
for Tree-Contractibility, based on a novel application of the color coding
technique of Alon, Yuster and Zwick. Furthermore, we show that
Path-Contractibility has a kernel with at most $5k+3$ vertices, while
Tree-Contractibility does not have a polynomial kernel unless coNP $\subseteq$
NP/poly. We find the latter result surprising, because of the strong connection
between Tree-Contractibility and Feedback Vertex Set, which is known to have a
vertex kernel with size $O(k^2)$.

between the discrete part of the spectrum of negative energies and the

regarded as a limiting case of a bound state with vanishing binding energy,
emerging for a particular set of critical potential parameters. In this work we
study the properties of these critical parameters for short range central
potentials. To this end we develop two exact methods and also utilize the first
and second order WKB approximations. Using these methods we have calculated the
critical parameters for several widely used central potentials.
  The general analytic expressions for the asymptotic representations of the
critical parameters were derived for cases where either the orbital quantum
number $l$ or the number $n$ of bound states approaches infinity.
  The above mathematical models enable us to answer the following physical
(quantum mechanical) questions: i) what is the number of bound states for a
given central potential and given orbital quantum number $l$; ii) what is the
maximum value of $l$ which can provide a bound state for the given central
potential; iii) what is the order of energy levels for the given form of the
central potential.

the shocked gas within the flow time at any radius. Outflows are therefore

velocity-integrated CO intensity (W), is determined by the physical properties
of gas in model molecular clouds (MCs). We perform radiative transfer
calculations on chemical-MHD models to compute X. Using integrated NH2 and W
reproduces the limited range in X found in observations, resulting in a mean
value X=2\times10^20 s/cm^2/K^1/km^1 from the Galactic MC model. However, in
limited velocity intervals, X can take on a much larger range due to CO line
saturation. Thus, X strongly depends on both the range in gas velocities and
volume densities. The temperature (T) variations within individual MCs do not
strongly affect X, as dense gas contributes most to setting X. For fixed
velocity and density structure, gas with higher T has higher W, yielding X ~
T^-1/2 for T~20-100 K. We demonstrate that the linewidth-size scaling relation
does not influence the X factor - only the range in velocities is important.
Clouds with larger linewidths, regardless of the linewidth-size relation, have
a higher W, corresponding to a lower value of X, scaling roughly as X ~
sigma^-1/2. The ""mist"" model, consisting of optically thick cloudlets with
well-separated velocities, does not accurately reflect the conditions in a
turbulent MC. We propose that the observed cloud-average values of X ~ XGal is
simply a result of the limited range in NH2, temperatures, and velocities found
in Galactic MCs - a ~constant value of X therefore does not require any
linewidth-size relation, or that MCs are virialized objects. Since gas
properties likely differ (slightly) between clouds, masses derived through a
standard X should only be considered as a rough first estimate. For
temperatures T~10-20 K, velocity dispersions ~1-6 km/s, and NH2~2-20\times10^21
cm^-2, we find cloud-averaged X ~ 2-4\times10^20 s/cm^2/K^1/km^1 for
Solar-metallicity models.

of stiff evolutionary PDEs that guarantees an effective error control of the
simulation, independent of the fastest physical time scale for highly unsteady

order embedded splitting scheme that takes into account potential loss of order
due to the stiffness featured by time-space multi-scale phenomena. The scheme
is then built upon a precise numerical analysis of the method and a
complementary numerical procedure, conceived to overcome classical restrictions
of adaptive time stepping schemes based on lower order embedded methods,
whenever asymptotic estimates fail to predict the dynamics of the problem. The
performance of the method in terms of control of integration errors is
evaluated by numerical simulations of stiff propagating waves coming from
nonlinear chemical dynamics models as well as highly multi-scale nanosecond
repetitively pulsed gas discharges, which allow to illustrate the method
capabilities to consistently describe a broad spectrum of time scales and
different physical scenarios for consecutive discharge/post-discharge phases.

infrared observations, only the superb image quality (FWHM ~0.5"") of our VLT /
HAWK-I data could reveal, for the first time, its peculiar morphology. It
consists of a very red point-like central source that is surrounded by a
roughly spherical nebula, which is intersected by a remarkable dark lane
through the center. We construct the spectral energy distribution of the object
from 1 to 870 microns and perform a detailed radiative transfer modeling of the
spectral energy distribution and the source morphology. The observed object
morphology in the near-IR images clearly suggests a young stellar object that
is embedded in an extended, roughly spherical envelope and surrounded by a
large circumstellar disk with a diameter of ~5500 AU that is seen nearly
edge-on. The radiative transfer modeling shows that the central object is a
massive (10-15 Msun) young stellar object. The circumstellar disk has a mass of
about 2 Msun. The disk object in Carina is one of the most massive young
stellar objects for which a circumstellar disk has been detected so far, and
the size and mass of the disk are very large compared to the corresponding
values found for most other similar objects.

still lacking. Comparison of different populations of weighted networks is hard
because topology is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined
as the number of edges in an unweighted graph. In this paper, we evaluate the
benefits and limitations associated with using cost-integrated topological
metrics. Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted undirected graphs
using global efficiency. We evaluate different approaches to the comparison of
weighted networks that differ in mean association weight. Our key result shows
that integrating over cost is equivalent to controlling for any monotonic
transformation of the weight set of a weighted graph. That is, when integrating
over cost, we eliminate the differences in topology that may be due to a
monotonic transformation of the weight set. Our result holds for any unweighted
topological measure. Cost-integration is therefore helpful in disentangling
differences in cost from differences in topology. By contrast, we show that the
use of the weighted version of a topological metric does not constitute a valid
approach to this problem. Indeed, we prove that, under mild conditions, the use
of the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing
weighted costs. Thus, we recommend the reporting of (i) differences in weighted
costs and (ii) differences in cost-integrated topological measures. We
demonstrate the application of these techniques in a re-analysis of an fMRI
working memory task. Finally, we discuss the limitations of integrating
topology over cost, which may pose problems when some weights are zero, when
multiplicities exist in the ranks of the weights, and when one expects subtle
cost-dependent topological differences, which could be masked by
cost-integration.

densities (for instance the electric charge, energy or momentum) evolve as a
function of time and eventually relax back to their equilibrium values. Here
the transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma are reviewed from a
theoretical perspective. The latter play a key role in the description of
heavy-ion collisions, and are an important ingredient in constraining particle
production processes in the early universe. We place particular emphasis on
lattice QCD calculations of conserved current correlators. These Euclidean
correlators are related by an integral transform to spectral functions, whose
small-frequency form determines the transport properties via Kubo formulae. The
universal hydrodynamic predictions for the small-frequency pole structure of
spectral functions are summarized. The viability of a quasiparticle description
implies the presence of additional characteristic features in the spectral
functions. These features are in stark contrast with the functional form that
is found in strongly coupled plasmas via the gauge/gravity duality. A central
goal is therefore to determine which of these dynamical regimes the quark-gluon
plasma is qualitatively closer to as a function of temperature. We review the
analysis of lattice correlators in relation to transport properties, and
tentatively estimate what computational effort is required to make decisive
progress in this field.

entangling surface is the black hole horizon. I review a variety of aspects of
this calculation: the useful mathematical tools such as the geometry of spaces
with conical singularities and the heat kernel method, the UV divergences in
the entropy and their renormalization, the logarithmic terms in the
entanglement entropy in 4 and 6 dimensions and their relation to the conformal
anomalies. The focus in the review is on the systematic use of the conical

differences between different mass eigenstates of neutrinos. The absolute mass
scale is however not determined, with at present the strongest upper limits
coming from astronomical observations rather than terrestrial experiments. The
presence of massive neutrinos suppresses the growth of perturbations below a
characteristic mass scale, thereby leading to a decreased abundance of
collapsed dark matter halos. Here we show that this effect can significantly
alter the predicted luminosity function (LF) of high redshift galaxies. In
particular we demonstrate that a stringent constraint on the neutrino mass can
be obtained using the well measured galaxy LF and our semi-analytic structure
formation models. Combining the constraints from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe 7 year (WMAP7) data with the LF data at z = 4, we get a limit
on the sum of the masses of 3 degenerate neutrinos \Sigma m_\nu < 0.52 eV at
the 95 % CL. The additional constraints using the prior on Hubble constant
strengthens this limit to \Sigma m_\nu < 0.29 eV at the 95 % CL. This neutrino
mass limit is a factor of order 4 improvement compared to the constraint based
on the WMAP7 data alone, and as stringent as known limits based on other
astronomical observations. As different astronomical measurements may suffer
from different set of biases, the method presented here provides a
complementary probe of \Sigma m_\nu . We suggest that repeating this exercise
on well measured luminosity functions over different redshift ranges can
provide independent and tighter constraints on \Sigma m_\nu .

spiral, barred and flocculent galaxies, the Milky Way, halos and relics of
galaxy clusters, and for the intergalactic medium. Polarization observations
with the forthcoming large radio telescopes will open a new era in the
observation of cosmic magnetic fields and will help to understand their origin.
At low frequencies, LOFAR (10-250 MHz) will allow us to map the structure of
weak magnetic fields in the outer regions and halos of galaxies and galaxy
clusters. Polarization at higher frequencies (1-10 GHz), as observed with the
EVLA, ASKAP, MeerKAT, APERTIF and the SKA, will trace magnetic fields in the
disks and central regions of nearby galaxies in unprecedented detail. Surveys
of Faraday rotation measures of pulsars will map the Milky Way's magnetic field
with high precision. All-sky surveys of Faraday rotation measures towards a
dense grid of polarized background sources with the SKA and its precursor
telescope ASKAP are dedicated to measure magnetic fields in distant intervening
galaxies, galaxy clusters and intergalactic filaments, and will be used to
model the overall structure and strength of the magnetic field in the Milky
Way.

state of this model thanks to a combinatorial algorithm, which was subsequently
interpreted as a matrix product representation by Evans et al. (2009). This
`matrix ansatz' shows that the stationary state of the multi-species TASEP with
N classes of particles (N-TASEP) can be constructed algebraically by the action
of an operator on the (N-1)-TASEP stationary state. Besides, Arita et al.
(2009) analyzed the spectral structure of the Markov matrix: they showed that
the set of eigenvalues of the N-TASEP contains those of the (N-1)-TASEP and
that the various spectral inclusions can be encoded in a hierarchical
set-theoretic structure known as the Hasse diagram. Inspired by these works, we
define nontrivial operators that allow us to construct eigenvectors of the
N-TASEP by lifting the eigenvectors of the (N-1)-TASEP. This goal is achieved
by generalizing the matrix product representation and the Ferrari-Martin

convenient tool to write the stationary state but in fact intertwines Markov
matrices of different values of N.

luminosity and angular diameter distances. This combination enables us to probe
galaxy cluster physics or even to test the validity of the distance-duality
relation itself. We explore these possibilities based on two different, but
complementary approaches. Firstly, in order to constrain the possible galaxy
cluster morphologies, the validity of the distance-duality relation (DD
relation) is assumed in the $\Lambda$CDM framework (WMAP7). Secondly, by
adopting a cosmological-model-independent test, we directly confront the
angular diameters from galaxy clusters with two supernovae Ia (SNe Ia)
subsamples (carefully chosen to coincide with the cluster positions). The
influence of the different SNe Ia light-curve fitters in the previous analysis
are also discussed. We assumed that $\eta$ is a function of the redshift
parametrized by two different relations: $\eta(z) = 1 + \eta_{0}z$, and
$\eta(z)=1 + \eta_{0}z/(1+z)$, where $\eta_0$ is a constant parameter
quantifying the possible departure from the strict validity of the DD relation.
The statistical analysis presented here provides new evidence that the true
geometry of clusters is elliptical. We find that the two-light curve fitters
(SALT2 and MLCS2K2) present a statistically significant conflict, and a joint
analysis involving the different approaches suggests that clusters are endowed
with an elliptical geometry as previously assumed.

candidate in the habitable zone, i.e. GL 581 d. Orbital simulations have shown
that additional planets inside the habitable zone of GL 581 would be
dynamically stable. Recently, two further planet candidates have been claimed,
one of them in the habitable zone.
  In view of the ongoing search for planets around M stars which is expected to
result in numerous detections of potentially habitable Super-Earths, we take
the GL 581 system as an example to investigate such planets. In contrast to
previous studies of habitability in the GL 581 system, we use a consistent
atmospheric model to assess surface conditions and habitability. Furthermore,
we perform detailed atmospheric simulations for a much larger subset of
potential planetary and atmospheric scenarios than previously considered.
  A 1D radiative-convective atmosphere model is used to calculate temperature
and pressure profiles of model atmospheres, which we assumed to be composed of
molecular nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. In these calculations, key
parameters such as surface pressure and CO2 concentration as well as orbital
distance and planetary mass are varied.
  Results imply that surface temperatures above freezing could be obtained,
independent of the here considered atmospheric scenarios, at an orbital
distance of 0.117 AU. For an orbital distance of 0.146 AU, CO2 concentrations
as low as 10 times the present Earth's value are sufficient to warm the surface
above the freezing point of water. At 0.175 AU, only scenarios with CO2
concentrations of 5% and 95% were found to be habitable. Hence, an additional
Super-Earth planet in the GL 581 system in the previously determined dynamical
stability range would be considered a potentially habitable planet.

finding an $\eps$-approximate Nash equilibrium with near-optimal value in a
two-player game is as hard as finding a hidden clique of size $O(\log n)$ in
the random graph $G(n,1/2)$. This raises the question of whether a similar
intractability holds for approximate Nash equilibrium without such constraints.
We give evidence that the constraint of near-optimal value makes the problem
distinctly harder: a simple algorithm finds an optimal 1/2-approximate
equilibrium, while finding strictly better than 1/2-approximate equilibria is
as hard as the Hidden Clique problem. This is in contrast to the unconstrained
problem where more sophisticated algorithms, achieving better approximations,
are known.
  Unlike general Nash equilibrium, which is in PPAD, optimal (maximum value)
Nash equilibrium is NP-hard. We proceed to show that optimal Nash equilibrium
is just one of several known NP-hard problems related to Nash equilibrium, all
of which have approximate variants which are as hard as finding a planted
clique. In particular, we show this for approximate variants of the following
problems: finding a Nash equilibrium with value greater than $\eta$ (for any
$\eta>0$, even when the best Nash equilibrium has value $1-\eta$), finding a
second Nash equilibrium, and finding a Nash equilibrium with small support.
  Finally, we consider the complexity of approximate pure Bayes Nash equilibria
in two-player games. Here we show that for general Bayesian games the problem
is NP-hard. For the special case where the distribution over types is uniform,
we give a quasi-polynomial time algorithm matched by a hardness result based on
the Hidden Clique problem.

in two stages: first it applies orthogonal similarity transformations to reduce
A to upper Hessenberg form H, and second it computes the characteristic
polynomial of H from characteristic polynomials of leading principal
submatrices of H. If A is symmetric, then H is symmetric tridiagonal, and La
Budde's method simplifies to the Sturm sequence method. If A is diagonal then
La Budde's method reduces to the Summation Algorithm, a Horner-like scheme used
by the MATLAB function POLY to compute characteristic polynomials from
eigenvalues. We present recursions to compute the individual coefficients of
the characteristic polynomial in the second stage of La Budde's method, and
derive running error bounds for symmetric and nonsymmetric matrices. We also
show that La Budde's method can be more accurate than POLY, especially for
indefinite and nonsymmetric matrices A. Unlike POLY, La Budde's method is not
affected by illconditioning of eigenvalues, requires only real arithmetic, and
allows the computation of individual coefficients.

the deceleration q(x) and the Hubble t0H(x), we get a differential equation
(where x = t/t0 is the age of the universe relative to its present value t0).
First integration gives the function H(x). The present values of the Hubble
parameter H(1) [approximately t0H(1) \approx 1], and the deceleration parameter
[approximately q(1)\approx - 0.5], determine the function H(x). A second
integration gives the cosmological scale factor a(x). Differentiation of a(x)
gives the speed of expansion of the universe. The evolution of the universe
that results from our approach is: an initial extremely fast exponential
expansion (inflation), followed by an almost linear expansion (first
decelerated, and later accelerated). For the future, at approximately t \approx
3t0 there is a final exponential expansion, a second inflation that produces a
disaggregation of the universe to infinity. We find the necessary and
sufficient conditions for this disaggregation to occur. The precise value of
the final age is given only with one parameter: the present value of the
deceleration parameter q(1) \approx - 0.5]. This emerging picture of the

the immediate research on the Universe. These conclusions have been elaborated
