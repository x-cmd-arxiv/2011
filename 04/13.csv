limited sample of Galactic post-AGB stars is so large that there is no
consensus yet on how the different objects are linked by evolutionary channels.
The evaluation is complicated by the fact that their distances and hence
luminosities remain largely unknown. Via cross-correlation of the Spitzer SAGE
catalogue with optical catalogues we selected a sample of LMC post-AGB
candidates based on their [8]-[24] colour index and estimated luminosity. We
determined the fundamental properties of the central stars of 105 of these
objects using low-resolution, optical spectra that we obtained at Siding Spring
Observatory and SAAO, and constructed a catalogue of 70 high probability and
1337 candidate post-AGB stars that is available at the CDS. The sample forms an
ideal testbed for stellar evolution theory predictions of the final phase of
low- and intermediate-mass stars, because the distance and hence luminosity and
also the current and initial mass of these objects is well constrained. About
half of the objects in our sample of post-AGB candidates show a spectral energy
distribution (SED) that is indicative of a disc rather than an expanding and
cooling AGB remnant. Like in the Galaxy, the disc sources are likely associated
with binary evolution. Important side products of this research are catalogues
of candidate young stellar objects, candidate supergiants with circumstellar
dust, and discarded objects for which a spectrum was obtained. These too are
available at the CDS.

integrated systems. With the rise of cloud computing and systems-of-systems
(including cyber-physical systems) we are entering an era where mission
critical services and applications will be dependent upon
'coalitions-of-systems'. Coalitions-of-systems (CoS) are a class of system
similar to systems-of-systems but they differ in that they interact to further
overlapping self-interests rather than an overarching mission. Assessing the
sociotechnical risks associated with CoS is an open research question of
societal importance as existing risk analysis techniques typically focus on the
technical aspects of systems and ignore risks associated with coalition
partners reneging on responsibilities or leaving the coalition. We demonstrate
that a responsibility modeling based risk analysis approach enables the
identification of sociotechnical risks associated with CoS. The approach
identifies hazards and associated risks that may arise when relying upon a
coalition of human/organizational/technical agents to provision a service or
application. Through a case study of a proposed cloud IT infrastructure
migration we show how the technique identifies vulnerabilities that may arise
because of human, organizational or technical agents failing to discharge
responsibilities.

context of orthogonal and symplectic Clifford algebras, first for particles,
and then for fields. It is shown that the generators of Clifford algebras have
the role of quantum mechanical operators that satisfy the Heisenberg equations
of motion. For quadratic Hamiltonians, the latter equations are obtained from
the classical equations of motion, rewritten in terms of the phase space
coordinates and the corresponding basis vectors. Then, assuming that such
equations hold for arbitrary path, i.e., that coordinates and momenta are
undetermined, we arrive at the equations that contains basis vectors and their
time derivatives only. According to this approach, quantization of a classical
theory, formulated in phase space, is replacement of the phase space variables
with the corresponding basis vectors (operators). The basis vectors,
transformed into the Witt basis, satisfy the bosonic or fermionic
(anti)commutation relations, and can create spinor states of all minimal left
ideals of the corresponding Clifford algebra. We consider some specific actions
for point particles and fields, formulated in terms of commuting and/or
anticommuting phase space variables, together with the corresponding symplectic
or orthogonal basis vectors. Finally we discuss why such approach could be
useful for grand unification and quantum gravity.

occur near the periastron passage of two massive stars in a very eccentric
orbit. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the variations of
different spectral features, such as an eclipse by the wind-wind collision
boundary, a shell ejection from the primary star or accretion of its wind onto
the secondary. All of them have problems explaining all the observed phenomena.
To better understand the nature of the cyclic events, we performed a dense
monitoring of eta Carinae with 5 Southern telescopes during the 2009 low
excitation event, resulting in a set of data of unprecedented quality and
sampling. The intrinsic luminosity of the He II 4686 emission line (L~310 Lsun)

It consists of a GaN cavity embedded between two GaN/AlGaN Distributed Bragg
Reflectors designed for a reference mode coincident with a second harmonic
field generated in the near UV region (~ 400 nm). Critical issues for this
target are the crystalline quality of the material, together with sharp and

Most cases of cervical cancer can be prevented through screening programs aimed
at detecting precancerous lesions. During Digital Colposcopy, Specular
Reflections (SR) appear as bright spots heavily saturated with white light.
These occur due to the presence of moisture on the uneven cervix surface, which
act like mirrors reflecting light from the illumination source. Apart from
camouflaging the actual features, the SR also affects subsequent segmentation
routines and hence must be removed. Our novel technique eliminates the SR and
makes the colposcopic images (cervigram) ready for segmentation algorithms. The
cervix region occupies about half of the cervigram image. Other parts of the
image contain irrelevant information, such as equipment, frames, text and
non-cervix tissues. This irrelevant information can confuse automatic
identification of the tissues within the cervix. The first step is, therefore,
focusing on the cervical borders, so that we have a geometric boundary on the
relevant image area. We have proposed a type of modified kmeans clustering
algorithm to evaluate the region of interest.

objects in dynamic applications, where programs need to react efficiently to
changes of their environment. Researchers have long investigated how to take
advantage of dataflow constraints by embedding them into procedural languages.
Previous mixed imperative/dataflow systems, however, require syntactic
extensions or libraries of ad hoc data types for binding the imperative program
to the dataflow solver. In this paper we propose a novel approach that smoothly
combines the two paradigms without placing undue burden on the programmer. In
our framework, programmers can define ordinary commands of the host imperative
language that enforce constraints between objects stored in ""reactive"" memory
locations. Reactive objects can be of any legal type in the host language,
including primitive data types, pointers, arrays, and structures. Constraints
are automatically re-executed every time their input memory locations change,
letting a program behave like a spreadsheet where the values of some variables
depend upon the values of other variables. The constraint solving mechanism is
handled transparently by altering the semantics of elementary operations of the
host language for reading and modifying objects. We provide a formal semantics
and describe a concrete embodiment of our technique into C/C++, showing how to
implement it efficiently in conventional platforms using off-the-shelf
compilers. We discuss relevant applications to reactive scenarios, including
incremental computation, observer design pattern, and data structure repair.
The performance of our implementation is compared to ad hoc problem-specific
change propagation algorithms and to language-centric approaches such as
self-adjusting computation and subject/observer communication mechanisms,
showing that the proposed approach is efficient in practice.

interactions are calculated with leading order perturbative QCD, but feature a
more precise Debye screening derived within the hard thermal loop approximation
and obey the running of the coupling. Within this framework the elliptic flow
and the nuclear modification factor of heavy quarks are computed for RHIC and
LHC energies and compared to available experimental data. It is found that
binary scatterings alone cannot reproduce the data and, therefore, radiative
corrections have to be taken into account.

requirements during a fast partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on
2000 June 28 by the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) aboard the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). We use two methods to derive
densities from the UVCS measurements, including a density sensitive O V line
ratio at 1213.85 and 1218.35 Angstroms, and radiative pumping of the O VI
1032,1038 doublet by chromospheric emission lines. The most strongly
constrained feature shows cumulative plasma heating comparable to or greater
than the kinetic energy, while features observed earlier during the event show
cumulative plasma heating of order or less than the kinetic energy. SOHO
Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) observations are used to estimate the active
region magnetic energy. We consider candidate plasma heating mechanisms and
provide constraints when possible. Because this CME was associated with a
relatively weak flare, the contribution by flare energy (e.g., through thermal
conduction or energetic particles) is probably small; however, the flare may
have been partially behind the limb. Wave heating by photospheric motions
requires heating rates significantly larger than those previously inferred for
coronal holes, but the eruption itself could drive waves which heat the plasma.
Heating by small-scale reconnection in the flux rope or by the CME current
sheet is not significantly constrained. UVCS line widths suggest that
turbulence must be replenished continually and dissipated on time scales
shorter than the propagation time in order to be an intermediate step in CME
heating.

star IRC+10216 was announced. This detection challenged the current
understanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to be
absent in carbon-rich stars. Several explanations for the occurrence of water
vapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets or
dwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, and
photochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. However, the only water
line detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, by
itself, between the different mechanisms proposed. Here we report on the
detection by the Herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in the
far-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of IRC+10216, including some
high-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 K. The emission of
these high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour is
present in the warm inner region of the envelope. A plausible explanation for
the formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet
(UV) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. This mechanism triggers
also the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observed
abundances are much higher than hitherto predicted.

which is directly related to a generalized uncertainty principle the
implementation of the gauge principle becomes much more intricated. It has been
shown in another paper how gauge theories have to be extended in general, if
there is assumed the existence of a minimal length. In this paper this
generalization of the description of gauge theories is applied to the case of
Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N) to consider especially the
application to the electroweak theory as it appears in the standard model. The
modifications of the lepton-, Higgs- and gauge field sector of the extended
Lagrangian of the electroweak theory maintaining local gauge invariance under
$SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y$ transformations are investigated. There appear
additional interaction terms between the leptons or the Higgs particle
respectively with the photon and the W- and Z-bosons as well as additional
self-interaction terms of these gauge bosons themselves. It is remarkable that
in the quark sector where the full gauge group of the standard model, $SU(3)_c
\otimes SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y$, has to be considered there arise coupling terms
between the gluons und the W- and Z-bosons which means that the electroweak
theory is not separated from quantum chromodynamics anymore.

Disk surface layers ionized by stellar X-rays are susceptible to charge
neutralization by small condensates, ranging from ~0.01-micron-sized grains to
angstrom-sized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Ion densities in
X-ray-irradiated surfaces are so low that ambipolar diffusion weakens the MRI.
Here we show that ionization by stellar far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation enables
full-blown MRI turbulence in disk surface layers. Far-UV ionization of atomic
carbon and sulfur produces a plasma so dense that it is immune to ion
recombination on grains and PAHs. The FUV-ionized layer, of thickness 0.01--0.1
g/cm^2, behaves in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit and can accrete at
observationally significant rates at radii > 1--10 AU. Surface layer accretion
driven by FUV ionization can reproduce the trend of increasing accretion rate
with increasing hole size seen in transitional disks. At radii < 1--10 AU,
FUV-ionized surface layers cannot sustain the accretion rates generated at
larger distance, and unless turbulent mixing of plasma can thicken the
MRI-active layer, an additional means of transport is needed. In the case of
transitional disks, it could be provided by planets.

a scale-dependent correction to the bias of large-scale structure tracers such
as galaxies or clusters, whose amplitude depends on the bias of the tracers
itself. The dominant source of noise in the power spectrum of the tracers is
caused by sampling variance on large scales (where the non-Gaussian signal is
strongest) and shot noise arising from their discrete nature. Recent work has
argued that one can avoid sampling variance by comparing multiple tracers of
different bias, and suppress shot noise by optimally weighting halos of
different mass. Here we combine these ideas and investigate how well the
signatures of non-Gaussian fluctuations in the primordial potential can be
extracted from the two-point correlations of halos and dark matter. On the
basis of large $N$-body simulations with local non-Gaussian initial conditions
and their halo catalogs we perform a Fisher matrix analysis of the two-point
statistics. Compared to the standard analysis, optimal weighting- and
multiple-tracer techniques applied to halos can yield up to one order of
magnitude improvements in $\fnl$-constraints, even if the underlying dark
matter density field is not known. We compare our numerical results to the halo
model and find satisfactory agreement. Forecasting the optimal
$\fnl$-constraints that can be achieved with our methods when applied to
existing and future survey data, we find that a survey of
$50h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ volume resolving all halos down to $10^{11}\hMsun$ at
$z=1$ will be able to obtain $\sigma_{\fnl}\sim1$ (68% cl), a factor of
$\sim20$ improvement over the current limits. Decreasing the minimum mass of
resolved halos, increasing the survey volume or obtaining the dark matter maps
can further improve these limits, potentially reaching the level of
$\sigma_{\fnl}\sim0.1$. (abridged)

secondary CO clears a gap. We show that the gap refills during the late
GW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden EM brightening of the
source. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular
momentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due
to accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an
analytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body
approach. We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant
perturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto
the CO and hydrodynamic drag. Depending on whether a gap is present, the
perturbation of the GW phase is between 10 and 1000 radians per year,
detectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) at high
significance. The Fourier transform of the disk-modified GW in the stationary
phase approximation is sensitive to disk parameters with a frequency trend
different from post-Newtonian vacuum corrections. Our results suggest that
observations of EMRIs may place new sensitive constraints on the physics of
accretion disks.

Overall, pressures are well correlated with local starlight intensities and
extreme kinematics. Approximately 23% of the gas is at a pressure that is below

dispersion of thermal pressures in the cold, neutral ISM is predominantly
governed by microscopic turbulence driven by star forming regions, with some
additional effects from macroscopic events (e.g., SN explosions), and these

the highest reddening is found in the star-forming wing of the SMC. In general
the regions with higher reddening are in good spatial agreement with infrared

properly described. Interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-
concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 Msuns and a molecular
outflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 Msuns. The molecular gas close to the
systemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about
4.1x108 Msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. This compact molecular
nucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 Msuns/pc^2, more than
two orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the disk
of the Milky Way, and it appears to sit on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
despite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. We interpret this
nucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. A mass outflow rate of 13
Msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 Myr. The star formation in
NGC 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven by
the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The concentration of the majority of the
molecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angular
momentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enable
the transfer. NGC 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that does

determine the Ly-alpha and rest-UV luminosity functions (LFs). The
substantially improved evaluation of the Ly-alpha LF at z=6.5 shows an apparent
deficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even at
the faint end, though small uncertainties remain. The rest-UV LFs at z=6.5 and
5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to the
differences seen in the Ly-alpha LF. These results imply an increase in the
neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. The rest-frame
equivalent width (EW_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematically
smaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger EW_0. The
bright end of the rest-UV LF can be reproduced from the observed Ly-alpha LF
and a reasonable EW_0-UV luminosity relation. Integrating this rest-UV LF
provides the first measurement of the contribution of LAEs to the photon budget

contribution of LAEs to the photon budget among Lyman break galaxies
significantly increases towards faint magnitudes. Low-luminosity LAEs could
dominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly on
the uncertain faint-end slope of the Ly-alpha LF.

Constraints from current data combination of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) are almost entirely due to the
impact of the neutrinos on the expansion rate, and how those changes to the
expansion rate alter the ratio of the photon diffusion scale to the sound
horizon scale at recombination. We demonstrate that very little of the
constraining power comes from the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect,
and also provide a first determination of the amplitude of the early ISW
effect. Varying the fraction of baryonic mass in Helium, Yp, also changes the
ratio of damping to sound-horizon scales. We discuss the physical effects that
prevent the resulting near-degeneracy between Neff and Yp from being a complete
one. Examining light element abundance measurements, we see no significant
evidence for evolution of Neff and the baryon-to-photon ratio from the epoch of
big bang nucleosynthesis to decoupling. Finally, we consider measurements of
the distance-redshift relation at low to intermediate redshifts and their
implications for the value of Neff.

system unaltered. The validity of this latter assumption is accurately checked
by comparing analytical predictions on such a growth with the results of
numerical simulation. We show that the spherically averaged density profile of
virialised objects can be inferred with no need to specify their shape. The
{\it typical} spherically averaged halo density profile is inferred, down to
arbitrarily small radii, from the power-spectrum of density perturbations. The
predicted profile in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is approximately described by
an Einasto profile, meaning that it does not have a cusp but rather a core,
where the inner slope slowly converges to zero. Down to one hundredth the total
radius, the profile has the right NFW and Einasto forms, being close to the
latter down to a radius of about four orders of magnitude less. The inner
consistency of the model implies that the density profiles of haloes harbour no
information on their past aggregation history. This would explain why major
mergers do not alter the typical density profile of virialised objects formed
by SI and do not invalidate the peak formalism based on such a formation.

Domains, like graphite as a whole, possess the property of transverse isotropy,

detector system is being designed. It consists of a large array of non-imaging
Cherenkov detectors with a light sensitive area of 0.5 square metres each. The
total effective area of the detector will be 100 square kilometres. A large
inter-station distance of 150 metres and a simple and inexpensive station
design will make the instrumentation of such a large area feasible. A detailed
detector simulation and event reconstruction system has been developed and used
in conjunction with the CORSIKA air-shower simulation to estimate the
sensitivity of the detector to gamma-ray point sources. The threshold for
gamma-rays is 44 TeV (50% trigger efficiency) in the standard configuration,
and the minimal detectable flux from a point source is below 10^(-13) erg / (s
cm^2) above 100 TeV. Several options to lower the energy threshold of the

station spacing of 100 metres, and is further decreased to 24 TeV if the
detector is set up at an altitude of 2000 metres above sea level. At a spacing
of 150 metres, however, a higher altitude has no positive effect on the energy
threshold. The threshold can also be reduced if the detector stations consist
of small, independent 2 x 2 sub-arrays. In this case, the station spacing is
not significant for the threshold, but again a higher altitude decreases the

of hundreds of millions of stars by comparing the parallactic displacements in
the two fields of view of the optical instrument. The requirements on the
stability of the 'basic angle' between the two fields are correspondingly
strict, and possible variations (on the microarcsec level) are therefore
monitored by an on-board metrology system. Nevertheless, since even very small
periodic variations of the basic angle might cause a global offset of the
measured parallaxes, it is important to find independent verification methods.
Aims. We investigate the potential use of Galactic Cepheids as standard candles
for verifying the Gaia parallax zero point. Methods. We simulate the complete
population of Galactic Cepheids and their observations by Gaia. Using the
simulated data, simultaneous fits are made of the parameters of the
period-luminosity relation and a global parallax zero point. Results. The total
number of Galactic Cepheids is estimated at about 20 000, of which nearly half
could be observed by Gaia. In the most favourable circumstances, including
negligible intrinsic scatter and extinction errors, the determined parallax
zero point has an uncertainty of 0.2 microarcsec. With more realistic
assumptions the uncertainty is several times larger, and the result is very
sensitive to errors in the applied extinction corrections. Conclusions. The use
of Galactic Cepheids alone will not be sufficient to determine a possible
parallax zero-point error to the full potential systematic accuracy of Gaia.
The global verification of Gaia parallaxes will most likely depend on a
combination of many different methods, including this one.

interaction. The vector order parameter of this system lies on the vertices of
a cubic lattice, which is embedded in a system with a film geometry. The
orientations of the vectors are fixed at the two opposite sides of the film.
The angle between the vectors at the two boundaries is $\alpha$ where $0 \le
\alpha \le \pi$. We make use of the mean field approximation to study the mean
length and orientation of the vector order parameter throughout the film---and
the Casimir force it generates---as a function of the temperature $T$, the
angle $\alpha$, and the thickness $L$ of the system. Among the results of that
calculation are a Casimir force that depends in a continuous way on both the
parameter $\alpha$ and the temperature and that can be attractive or repulsive.
In particular, by varying $\alpha$ and/or $T$ one controls \underline{both} the
sign \underline{and} the magnitude of the Casimir force in a reversible way.
Furthermore, for the case $\alpha=\pi$, we discover an additional phase
transition occurring only in the finite system associated with the variation of
the orientations of the vectors.

of one-dimensional spin-1/2 fermions with strong repulsion in an external
magnetic field via the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method. The exact
thermodynamics of the model in a weak magnetic field is derived with the help
of Wiener-Hopf techniques. It turns out that the low energy physics can be
described by spin-charge separated conformal field theories of an effective
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an antiferromagnetic SU(2) Heisenberg spin chain.
However, these two types of conformally invariant low-lying excitations may
break down as excitations take place far away from the Fermi points. The long
distance asymptotics of the correlation functions and the critical exponents
for the model in the presence of a magnetic field at zero temperature are
derived in detail by solving dressed charge equations and by conformal mapping.
Furthermore, we calculate the conformal dimensions for particular cases of
correlation functions. The leading terms of these correlation functions are
given explicitly for a weak magnetic field $H\ll 1$ and for a magnetic field
close to the critical field $H\rightarrow H_{c}$. Our analytical results
provide insights into universal thermodynamics and criticality in
one-dimensional many-body physics.

properties of quasar accretion disks and properties of the lens galaxy such as
its dark matter fraction and mean stellar mass. Unfortunately the number of
lensed quasars ($\sim 90$) exceeds our monitoring capabilities. Thus,
estimating their microlensing properties is important for identifying good
microlensing candidates as well as for the expectations of future surveys. In
this work we estimate the microlensing properties of a sample of 87 lensed
quasars. While the median Einstein radius crossing time scale is 20.6 years,
the median source crossing time scale is 7.3 months. Broadly speaking, this
means that on $\sim 10$ year timescales roughly half the lenses will be
quiescent, with the source in a broad demagnified valley, and roughly half will
be active with the source lying in the caustic ridges. We also found that the
location of the lens system relative to the CMB dipole has a modest effect on
microlensing timescales, and in theory microlensing could be used to confirm
the kinematic origin of the dipole. As a corollary of our study we analyzed the
accretion rate parameters in a sub-sample of 32 lensed quasars. At fixed black
hole mass, it is possible to sample a broad range of luminosities (i.e.,
Eddington factors) if it becomes feasible to monitor fainter lenses.

optimization problem involving a sum over a potentially large number of

sampling a subset of the terms in the sum. These methods can make great
progress initially, but often slow as they approach a solution. In contrast,
full-gradient methods achieve steady convergence at the expense of evaluating
the full objective and gradient on each iteration. We explore hybrid methods
that exhibit the benefits of both approaches. Rate-of-convergence analysis
shows that by controlling the sample size in an incremental gradient algorithm,
it is possible to maintain the steady convergence rates of full-gradient
methods. We detail a practical quasi-Newton implementation based on this
approach. Numerical experiments illustrate its potential benefits.

promising candidate for the long standing mystery of the hidden order phase in

rationale of the selected multipole and the consequences of the antiferro
hexadecapole order of $xy(x^{2}-y^{2})$ symmetry. The mean-field solutions and
the collective excitations from them explain reasonably significant
experimental observations: the strong anisotropy in the magnetic
susceptibility, characteristic behavior of pressure versus magnetic field or
temperature phase diagrams, disappearance of inelastic neutron-scattering
intensity out of the hidden order phase, and insensitiveness of the NQR
frequency at Ru-sites upon ordering. A consistency with the strong anisotropy
in the magnetic responses excludes all the multipoles in two-dimensional
representations, such as $(O_{yz},O_{zx})$. The expected azimuthal angle
dependences of the resonant X-ray scattering amplitude are given. The
$(x^{2}-y^{2})$-type antiferro quadrupole should be induced by an in-plane
magnetic field along $[110]$, which is reflected in the thermal expansion and
the elastic constant of the transverse $(c_{11}-c_{12})/2$ mode. The
$(x^{2}-y^{2})$-type [$(xy)$-type] antiferro quadrupole is also induced by
applying the uniaxial stress along $[110]$ direction [$[100]$ direction]. A
detection of these induced antiferro quadrupoles under the in-plane magnetic
field or the uniaxial stress using the resonant X-ray scattering provides a
direct redundant test for the proposed order parameter.

strong IMF-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows that
highly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they have

is required that at each time instance a set of non-interfering nodes
(corresponding to an independent set in G) access the wireless medium. To
utilize wireless resources efficiently, it is required to arbitrate the access
of medium among interfering nodes properly. Moreover, to be of practical use,
such a mechanism is required to be totally distributed as well as simple. As
the main result of this paper, we provide such a medium access algorithm. It is
randomized, totally distributed and simple: each node attempts to access medium
at each time with probability that is a function of its local information. We
establish efficiency of the algorithm by showing that the corresponding network
Markov chain is positive recurrent as long as the demand imposed on the network
can be supported by the wireless network (using any algorithm). In that sense,
the proposed algorithm is optimal in terms of utilizing wireless resources. The
algorithm is oblivious to the network graph structure, in contrast with the
so-called `polynomial back-off' algorithm by Hastad-Leighton-Rogoff (STOC '87,

emission from the massive WR+O star binary WR~22 on the acceleration of the
stellar winds, radiative cooling, and orbital motion. Simulations were
performed with instantaneously accelerated and radiatively driven stellar
winds. Radiative transfer calculations were performed on the simulation output
to generate synthetic X-ray data, which are used to conduct a detailed
comparison against observations. When instantaneously accelerated stellar winds
are adopted in the simulation, a stable wind-wind collision region (WCR) is
established at all orbital phases. In contrast, when the stellar winds are
radiatively driven, and thus the acceleration regions of the winds are
accounted for, the WCR is far more unstable. As the stars approach periastron,
the ram pressure of the WR's wind overwhelms the O star's and, following a
significant disruption of the shocks by non-linear thin-shell instabilities
(NTSIs), the WCR collapses onto the O star. X-ray calculations reveal that when
a stable WCR exists the models over-predict the observed X-ray flux by more
than two orders of magnitude. The collapse of the WCR onto the O star
substantially reduces the discrepancy in the $2-10\;$keV flux to a factor of
$\simeq 6$ at $\phi=0.994$. However, the observed spectrum is not well matched
by the models. We conclude that the agreement between the models and
observations could be improved by increasing the ratio of the mass-loss rates
in favour of the WR star to the extent that a normal wind ram pressure balance
does not occur at any orbital phase, potentially leading to a sustained
collapse of the WCR onto the O star. Radiative braking may then play a
significant r\^{o}le for the WCR dynamics and resulting X-ray emission.

for semiconductor nanostructure based single-electron transistors (SETs), we
demonstrate that the image charge interaction breaks the molecular symmetries

gives rise to negative differential resistance (NDR). We show that the
appearance of NDR and its magnitude in the symmetry-broken benzene SET depends
in a complicated way on the interplay between the many-body matrix elements,
the lead tunnel coupling asymmetry, and the bias polarity. In particular, the
current reducing property of the blocking state causing the NDR, is shown to
vanish under strongly asymmetric tunnel couplings, when the molecule is coupled
stronger to the drain electrode. The calculated IV characteristic may serve as
an indicator for image charge broken molecular symmetries in experimental

parameters of such model are derived rigorously on the basis of
first-principles electronic structure calculations. In order to solve this
model we employ the optimized effective potential method and treat the
correlation interactions in the random phase approximation. Although
correlation interactions considerably reduce the intraatomic exchange splitting
in comparison with the Hartree-Fock method, this splitting still substantially
exceeds the typical values obtained in the local-spin-density approximation
(LSDA), which alters many predictions based on the LSDA. Our main results are
summarized as follows: (i) all ferromagnetic states are expected to be
half-metallic. However, their energies are generally higher than those of the
ferrimagnetic ordering between V- and Mo/Tc-sites (except Sr2VMoO6); (ii) all
ferrimagnetic states are metallic (except fully insulating Y2VTcO6) and no
half-metallic antiferromagnetism has been found; (iii) moreover, many of the
ferrimagnetic structures appear to be unstable with respect to the spin-spiral
alignment. Thus, the true magnetic ground state of the most of these systems is
expected to be more complex. In addition, we discuss several methodological
issues related to the nonuniqueness of the effective potential for the magnetic
half-metallic and insulating states.

a subclass of block-sequential models we call block-conditional MAR (BCMAR)

typically yields consistent estimates by selectively discarding some data.
Alternatively, full ML estimation can often be achieved via the EM algorithm.

pioneered novel optical methods of detecting extensive air showers (EAS) in the
Earth's atmosphere with the prime objective of searching for point sources of
energetic cosmic gamma-rays. Throughout that decade, progress was extremely
slow. Attempts to use the emission of optical Cherenkov radiation from showers
as a basis for TeV gamma-ray astronomy proved difficult and problematical,
given the rather primitive light-collecting systems in use at the time, coupled
with a practical inability to reject the overwhelming background arising from
hadronic showers. Simultaneously, a number of groups experimented with passive
detection of radio emission from EAS as a possible cheap, simple, stand-alone
method to detect and characterise showers of energy greater than 10^16 eV. By
the end of the decade, it was shown that the radio emission was quite highly
beamed and hence the effective collection area for detection of high energy
showers was quite limited, diminishing the effectiveness of the radio signature
as a stand-alone shower detection channel. By the early 1970s much of the early
optimism for both the optical and radio techniques was beginning to dissipate,
greatly reducing research activity. However, following a long hiatus both
avenues were in time revived, the optical in the early 1980s and the radio in
the early 2000s. With the advent of digital logic hardware, powerful low-cost
computing, the ability to perform Monte Carlo simulations and above all,
greatly improved funding, rapid progress became possible. In time this work
proved to be fundamental to both High Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy and Neutrino
Astrophysics. Here, that first decade of experimental investigation in both
fields is reviewed.

the ecliptic there is mounting evidence that in extrasolar systems the
inclination can be very high, at least for close-in planets. One process to
alter the inclination of a planet is through planet-disc interactions. Recent
simulations considering radiative transport have shown that the evolution of
migration and eccentricity can strongly depend on the thermodynamic state of
the disc. We extend previous studies to investigate the planet-disc
interactions of fixed and moving planets on inclined and eccentric orbits. We
also analyse the effect of the disc's thermodynamic properties on the orbital
evolution of embedded planets in detail. The protoplanetary disc is modelled as
a viscous gas where the internally produced dissipation is transported by
radiation. For locally isothermal discs, we confirm previous results and find
inclination damping and inward migration for planetary cores. For low
inclinations i < 2 H/r, the damping is exponential, while di/dt is proportional
to i^-2 for larger i. For radiative discs, the planetary migration is very
limited, as long as their inclination exceeds a certain threshold. If the
inclination is damped below this threshold, planetary cores with a mass up to
approximately 33 Earth masses start to migrate outwards, while larger cores
migrate inwards right from the start. The inclination is damped for all
analysed planet masses. In a viscous disc an initial inclination of embedded
planets will be damped for all planet masses. This damping occurs on timescales
that are shorter than the migration time. If the inclination lies beneath a
certain threshold, the outward migration in radiative discs is not handicapped.
Outward migration is strongest for circular and non-inclined orbits.

sigma_Lrad=0.63 and an intrinsic scatter of sigma_i,Lrad=0.59. A similar
relation is found for 235 MHz power, but a slightly flatter relation with
greater scatter is found for 1.4 GHz power, suggesting that low-frequency or
broad band radio measurements are superior jet power indicators. We find our
low-frequency relations to be in good agreement with previous observational
results. Comparison with jet models shows reasonable agreement, which may be
improved if radio sources have a significant low-energy electron population. We
consider possible factors which could bias our results or render them more
uncertain, and find that correcting for such factors in those groups we are
able to study in detail leads to a flattening of the Pjet:Lradio relation.

coagulation theory and its generalization to the diffusion-limited reaction
rate theory is presented. The traditional diffusion approach of the
Smoluchowski theory for coagulation of colloids is critically analyzed and
shown to be valid only in the particular case of coalescence of small particles
with large ones. It is shown that, owing to rapid diffusion mixing, coalescence
of comparable size particles occurs in the kinetic regime, realized under
condition of homogeneous spatial distribution of particles, in the two modes,
continuum and free molecular. Transition from the continuum to the free
molecular mode can be described by the interpolation expression derived within
the new analytical approach with fitting parameters that can be specified
numerically, avoiding semi-empirical assumptions of the traditional models. A
similar restriction arises in the traditional approach to the diffusion-limited
reaction rate theory, based on generalization of the Smoluchowski theory for
coagulation of colloids. In particular, it is shown that the traditional
approach is applicable only to the special case of reactions with a large
reaction radius, and becomes inappropriate to calculation of the reaction rate
in the case of a relatively small reaction radius. In the latter, more general
case particles collisions occur mainly in the kinetic regime (rather than in
the diffusion one) characterized by homogeneous (at random) spatial
distribution of particles. The calculated reaction rate for a small reaction
radius in 3-d formally coincides with the expression derived in the traditional
approach for reactions with a large reaction radius, however, notably deviates
at large times from the traditional result in the plane (2-d) geometry, that
has wide applications also in the membrane biology as well as in some other
important areas.

the shear stress tensor in a strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma is not
described by relaxation-type, fluid dynamical equations: at long times the
equations of motion should contain a \textit{second-order} comoving derivative
of the shear stress tensor. This occurs because in this strongly-coupled system
the lowest ""non-hydrodynamical"" quasinormal modes associated with shear stress
possess a nonzero real part at zero wavenumber. We use Weyl invariance to
obtain the most general equations of motion containing 2 comoving derivatives
of the shear stress tensor in the transient regime that are compatible with the
symmetries. We show that the asymptotic solution of this theory valid at times
much larger than the timescale associated with the ""non-hydrodynamical"" modes
reproduces the well-known results previously obtained directly from the AdS/CFT
correspondence. If the QGP formed in heavy ion collisions can be at least
qualitatively understood in terms of strongly-coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM
theory, the second time derivative present in the equations of motion of the
fluid may lead to an unexpected dependence on the initial conditions for the
shear stress tensor needed in numerical hydrodynamic simulations.

In such a Rydberg chain, similar to molecular aggregates, an electronic
excitation is delocalised due to long range dipole-dipole interactions among
the atoms. The transport of an exciton that is initially trapped by a chain
dislocation is strongly coupled to nuclear dynamics, forming a localised pulse
of combined excitation and displacement. This pulse transfers entanglement
between dislocated atoms adiabatically along the chain. Details about the
interaction and the preparation of the initial state are discussed. We also

normalized by that of randomly distributed particles is used to quantify the

results are consistent with previous investigations employing other approaches

Voronoi volumes and their Lagrangian autocorrelations. The small Voronoi

  Second problem is the exact controllability. This was studied for Burgers

satisfy some necessary conditions. In this paper we prove that it is also

the one-loop perturbative scattering amplitude computation and an analogy with
simpler reduced AdS_n x S^n theories with n=2,3. The n=2 theory is equivalent
to the N=2 2-d supersymmetric sine-Gordon model for which the exact quantum
S-matrix is known. In the n=3 case the one-loop perturbative S-matrix, improved
by a contribution of a local counterterm, satisfies the group factorization
property and the Yang-Baxter equation, and reveals the existence of a novel
quantum-deformed 2-d supersymmetry which is not manifest in the action. The
one-loop perturbative S-matrix of the reduced AdS_5 x S^5 theory has the group

some subtlety with the realisation of quantum integrability. As a possible
resolution, we propose that the S-matrix of this theory may be identified with

the strongly variable, accreting young sun-like star [KOS94] HA11, associated
with the dark cloud Lynds 1340, that exhibited large amplitude (5-6 magnitudes
in the I_C band) brightness variations on 2-3 years timescales, flat spectral
energy distribution (SED), and extremely strong (300 < EW/Angstrom < 900) H
alpha emission. In this Letter we describe the basic properties of the star,
derived from our observations between 1999 and 2011, and put into context the
observed phenomena. The observed variations in the emission spectra,
near-infrared colors, and SED suggest that [KOS94] HA11 (spectral type: K7--M0)
is an eruptive young star, possibly similar in nature to V1647 Ori: its
large-scale photometric variations are governed by variable accretion rate,
associated with variations in the inner disk structure. The star recently has
undergone strong and rapid brightness variations, thus its further observations
may offer a rare opportunity for studying structural and chemical
rearrangements of the inner disk, induced by variable central luminosity.

1+1-integrable field theories that are classically equivalent to superstrings
on symmetric space spacetimes F/G. They are formulated in terms of a
semi-symmetric space as a gauged WZW model with fermions and a potential term
to deform it away from the conformal fixed point. We consider in particular the
case of PSU(2,2|4)/Sp(2,2)xSp(4) which corresponds to AdS(5)xS(5). We argue
that the infinite tower of conserved charges of these theories includes an
exotic N=(8,8) supersymmetry that is realized in a mildy non-local way at the
Lagrangian level. The supersymmetry is associated to a double central extension
of the superalgebra psu(2|2)+psu(2|2) and includes a non-trivial R symmetry
algebra corresponding to global gauge transformations, as well as 2-dimensional
spacetime translations. We then explicitly construct soliton solutions and show
that they carry an internal moduli superspace CP(2|1)xCP(2|1) with both bosonic
and Grassmann collective coordinates. We show how to semi-classical quantize
the solitons by writing an effective quantum mechanical system on the moduli
space which takes the form of a co-adjoint orbit of SU(2|2)xSU(2|2). The
spectrum consists of a tower of massive states in the short, or atypical,
symmetric representations, just as the giant magnon states of the string world
sheet theory, although here the tower is truncated.

expected to give proof of sources near the Earth (e.g. supernova remnants such
as Vela: age < ~10^5 years located within <~1kpc). The idea itself is rather
old; a high energy electron emits synchrotron X-rays successively in the
geomagnetic field and thus gives several X-rays aligned on a meter scale. This
feature is a clue to overcome the background problem encountered in other
traditional observation methods. We critically examine the feasibility of this
approach assuming a satellite altitudes observation, and find that it is
difficult to derive a precise energy spectrum of electrons but is possible to
get a clear signal of the existence of several TeV electrons if the flux is
comparable to the level predicted by a class of plausible models. For such
observations, an exposure >1 m^2year would be needed. It would be attractive to
incorporate the present scheme in the gamma-ray burst observations.

contraction of a molecular cloud core. Since the inflow pattern changes
drastically before and after the first core formation, it is regarded as a
milestone in the star formation process. In order to identify the first core
from a mapping observation, the features expected for the first core are
studied for CS rotation transitions at radio wavelengths. The non-LTE radiation
transfer is calculated for the results of radiation magnetohydrodynamical
simulations of the contraction of the magnetized molecular cloud core in
rotation (Tomida et al. 2010a). We use the Monte-Carlo method to solve the
non-LTE radiation transfer in a nested grid hierarchy. In the first core phase,
an outflow arises from the vicinity of the first core due to the twisted
magnetic field amplified by the rotation motion of the contracting gas disk.
The disk and outflow system has several characteristic observational features:
(i) in the pole-on view, relatively opaque lines indicate asymmetry in the
emission lines in which the blue side is stronger than the red side (an infall
signature of the envelope); (ii) in the edge-on view, the disk has a signature
of simultaneous rotation and infall, i.e., the integrated intensity of the
reaching side is brighter than that of the receding side and the gradient in
the intensity-weighted velocity is larger in the reaching side; (iii) the
observed outflow indicates rotation around the rotation axis. The size of the
outflow gives the approximate age after the first core is formed, since the
outflow is not expected for the earlier runaway isothermal collapse phase.

to model statistically significant ensembles of galaxies. The underlying
physical prescriptions inherent to each SAM are, in many cases, different from
one another. Several SAMs have been applied to the dark matter merger trees
extracted from the Millennium Run, including those associated with the
well-known Munich and Durham lineages. We compare the predicted luminosity
distributions of galaxy groups using four publicly available SAMs (De Lucia et
al. 2006; Bower et al. 2006; Bertone et al. 2007; Font et al. 2008), in order
to explore a galactic environment in which the models have not been explored to
the same degree as they have in the field or in rich clusters. We identify a
characteristic ""wiggle"" in the group galaxy luminosity function generated using
the De Lucia et al. (2006) SAM, that is not present in the Durham-based models,
consistent to some degree with observations. However, a comparison between
conditional luminosity functions of groups between the models and observations
of Yang et al. (2007) suggest that neither model is a particularly good match.
The luminosity function wiggle is interpreted as the result of the two-mode AGN
feedback implementation used in the Munich models, which itself results in
flattened magnitude gap distribution. An associated analysis of the magnitude
gap distribution between first- and second-ranked group galaxies shows that
while the Durham models yield distributions with approximately equal luminosity
first- and second-ranked galaxies, in agreement with observations, the De Lucia
et al. models favours the scenario in which the second-ranked galaxy is
approximately one magnitude fainter than the primary,especially when the
dynamic range of the mock data is limited to 3 magnitudes.

are studied within the frame of the bubble model, where the bubble is described
by prescribed electromagnetic fields and has a perfectly spherical shape. The
author affirms that any elliptical trajectory of the form x'^2/{\gamma}_p^2 +
y'^2 = R^2 is solution of the equations of motion (in the bubble frame), within
the approximation p'_y^2/p'_x^2 \ll 1. In addition, he highlights that his

Kostyukov-Nerush-Pukhov-Seredov (KNPS). In this comment, we show that
numerically integrated trajectories, based on the same equations than the
analytical work of Thomas, lead to a completely different result for the
self-injection threshold, the result published by KNPS [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,

provide a discussion based on numerical simulations which show exactly where
the difference arises. We also show that the arguments of Thomas concerning the
error of KNPS do not hold, and that their analysis is mathematically correct.
Finally, we emphasize that if the KNPS threshold is found not to be verified in

power-law disks to derive a general expression linking the mass of the black
hole in active galactic nuclei (AGN), the mass of the surrounding disk, its
surface density profile (through the power index s), and the differential
rotation law. We find that the global rotation curve v(R) of the disk in
centrifugal balance does not obey a power law of the cylindrical radius R
(except in the confusing case s = -2 that mimics a Keplerian motion), and
discuss the local velocity index. This formula can help to understand how, from
position-velocity diagrams, mass is shared between the disk and the black hole.
To this purpose, we have checked the idea by generating a sample of synthetic
data with different levels of Gaussian noise, added in radius. It turns out
that, when observations are spread over a large radial domain and exhibit low
dispersion (standard deviation less than 10% typically), the disk properties
(mass and s-parameter) and black hole mass can be deduced from a non linear fit
of kinematic data plotted on a (R, Rv 2)-diagram. For a deviation higher than
10%, masses are estimated fairly well from a linear regression (corresponding
to the zeroth-order treatment of the formula), but the power index s is no
longer accessible. We have applied the model to 7 AGN disks whose rotation has
already been probed through water maser emission. For NGC3393 and UGC3789, the
masses seem well constrained through the linear approach. For IC1481, the
power-law exponent s can even be deduced. Because the model is scale-free, it
applies to any kind of star/disk system. Extension to disks around young stars
showing deviation from Keplerian motion is thus straightforward.

equilibrium with the Hawking temperature while in the second case there is an
energy flow between the black hole and the heat bath. Applying the fluctuation
theorems to these cases, we derive the generalized second law of black hole
thermodynamics. In the present paper, we treat the black hole as a constant

to which n can be calculated in these models depends on how precisely the
reheating temperature can be determined. The number of Einstein frame
e-foldings N is similar in both models, with N = 58-61 for singlet inflation
compared with N = 57-60 for Higgs inflation. This allows the spectral index to
be calculated to an accuracy \Delta n = 0.001. Provided the Higgs mass is above
~ 135 GeV, a combination of a Higgs mass measurement and a precise
determination of n will enable Higgs Inflation and S-inflation to be
distinguished.

be described by a classical, dissipative, non-abelian gauge theory. In fact,
such a theory has a hidden quantum nature due to its non-abelian character,
which is revealed through dissipation, when the theory reduces to a quantum
vacuum, where temperatures are of the order of absolute zero, and coherence of
quantum states is preserved. We consider in particular the case of pure SU(2)
gauge theory with a special anzatz for the gauge field, which breaks Lorentz
invariance. In the ansatz, a contraction mapping plays the role of dissipation.
In the limit of maximal dissipation, which corresponds to the attractive fixed
point of the contraction mapping, the gauge fields reduce, up to constant
factors, to the Pauli quantum gates for one-qubit states. Then tubuline-qubits
can be processed in the quantum vacuum of the classical field theory of the
brain, where decoherence is avoided due to the extremely low temperature.
Finally, we interpret the classical SU(2) dissipative gauge theory as the
quantum metalanguage (relative to the quantum logic of qubits), which holds the
non-algorithmic aspect of the mind.

general conditions to observe this phenomenon and study its implications for

algorithms for surface-embedded graphs on n vertices and branchwidth at most k.
Our technique applies to general families of problems where standard dynamic
programming runs in 2^{O(k log k)} n steps. Our approach combines tools from
topological graph theory and analytic combinatorics. In particular, we
introduce a new type of branch decomposition called ""surface cut
decomposition"", generalizing sphere cut decompositions of planar graphs
introduced by Seymour and Thomas, which has nice combinatorial properties.
Namely, the number of partial solutions that can be arranged on a surface cut
decomposition can be upper-bounded by the number of non-crossing partitions on
surfaces with boundary. It follows that partial solutions can be represented by
a single-exponential (in the branchwidth k) number of configurations. This
proves that, when applied on surface cut decompositions, dynamic programming
runs in 2^{O(k)} n steps. That way, we considerably extend the class of
problems that can be solved in running times with a single-exponential
dependence on branchwidth and unify/improve most previous results in this
direction.

sparse background populations in which intrinsic clustering is negligible with
respect to shot noise. We derive the optimal weighting function for general
case including scale independent and scale dependent weights. The optimal

molecular), and interstellar dust in the complex star forming region NGC6357
with the goal of studying the interplay between the massive stars in the open
cluster Pis24 and the surrounding interstellar matter. Our study of the
distribution of the ionized gas is based on narrow-band Hhalfa, [SII], and
[OIII] images obtained with the Curtis-Schmidt Camera at CTIO, Chile, and on
radio continuum observations at 1465 MHz taken with the VLA with a synthesized
beam of 40 arcsec. The distribution of the molecular gas is analyzed using
12CO(1-0) data obtained with the Nanten radiotelescope, Chile (angular
resolution = 2.7 arcmin). The interstellar dust distribution was studied using
mid-infrared data from the GLIMPSE survey and far-infrared observations from
IRAS. NGC6357 consists of a large ionized shell and a number of smaller optical
nebulosities. The optical, radio continuum, and near- and mid-IR images
delineate the distributions of the ionized gas and interstellar dust in the HII
regions and in previously unknown wind blown bubbles linked to the massive
stars in Pis24 revealing surrounding photodissociation regions. The CO line
observations allowed us to identify the molecular counterparts of the ionized
structures in the complex and to confirm the presence of photodissociation
regions. The action of the WR star HD157504 on the surrounding gas was also
investigated. The molecular mass in the complex is estimated to be (4+/-2)X10^5
Mo. Mean electron densities derived from the radio data suggest electron
densities > 200 cm^-3, indicating that NGC6357 is a complex formed in a region
of high ambient density. The known massive stars in Pis24 and a number of newly
inferred massive stars are mainly responsible for the excitation and
photodissociation of the parental molecular cloud.

the formation of novel aggregates. First, using transmission electron

lamella-forming PEO-PCL copolymers, and show that increasing the molecular
weight of the lamella-former at a constant ratio of its hydrophilic and
hydrophobic components leads to the formation of highly-curved structures even
at low sphere-former concentrations. This result is explained using a simple
argument based on the effective volumes of the two sections of the diblock and
is reproduced in a coarse-grained mean-field model: self-consistent field
theory (SCFT). Using further SCFT calculations, we study the distribution of
the two copolymer species within the individual aggregates and discuss how this
affects the self-assembled structures. We also investigate a binary mixture of
lamella-formers of different molecular weights, and find that this system forms
vesicles with a wall thickness intermediate to those of the vesicles formed by
the two copolymers individually. This result is also reproduced using SCFT.
Finally, a mixture of sphere-former and a copolymer with a large hydrophobic
block is shown to form a range of structures, including novel elongated
vesicles.

zigzag chains with an effective intrachain coupling J ~ -90 K and interchain

halo into at least two distinct components, an inner halo and an outer halo.
This result has been criticized by Schoenrich et al., who claim that the

faulty distances. We refute this claim, and demonstrate that the Schoenrich et
al. photometric distances are themselves flawed because they adopted an
incorrect main-sequence absolute magnitude relationship from the work of
Ivezi\'c et al. When compared to the recommended relation from Ivezi\'c et al.,
which is tied to a Milky Way globular cluster distance scale and accounts for
age and metallicity effects, the relation adopted by Schoenrich et al. yields
up to 18% shorter distances for stars near the main-sequence turnoff (TO). Use
of the correct relationship yields agreement between the distances assigned by
Carollo et al. and Ivezi\'{c} et al. for low-metallicity dwarfs to within
6-10%. Schoenrich et al. also point out that intermediate-gravity stars (3.5 <=
log g <= 4.0) with colors redder than the TO region are likely misclassified,
with which we concur. We implement a new procedure to reassign luminosity
classifications for the TO stars that require it. New derivations of the
rotational behavior demonstrate that the retrograde signature and high velocity
dispersion of the outer-halo population remains. We summarize additional lines
of evidence for a dual halo, including a test of the retrograde signature based
on proper motions alone, and conclude that the preponderance of evidence

represent a major issue in current public health, requiring notable efforts for
its prevention. Understanding the dynamics of infection transmission in a
hospital setting is essential for tailoring interventions and predicting the
spread among individuals. Mathematical models need to be informed with accurate
data on contacts among individuals. We used wearable active Radio-Frequency
Identification Devices to detect face-to-face contacts among individuals with a
spatial resolution of about 1.5 meters, and a time resolution of 20 seconds.
The study was conducted in a general pediatrics hospital ward, during a
one-week period, and included 119 participants. Nearly 16,000 contacts were
recorded during the study, with a median of approximately 20 contacts per
participants per day. Overall, 25% of the contacts involved a ward assistant,
23% a nurse, 22% a patient, 22% a caregiver, and 8% a physician. The majority
of contacts were of brief duration, but long and frequent contacts especially
between patients and caregivers were also found. In the setting under study,
caregivers do not represent a significant potential for infection spread to a
large number of individuals, as their interactions mainly involve the
corresponding patient. Nurses would deserve priority in prevention strategies
due to their central role in the potential propagation paths of infections. Our
study shows the feasibility of accurate and reproducible measures of the
pattern of contacts in a hospital setting. The results are particularly useful
for the study of the spread of respiratory infections, for monitoring critical
patterns, and for setting up tailored prevention strategies. Proximity-sensing
technology should be considered as a valuable tool for measuring such patterns
and evaluating nosocomial prevention strategies in specific settings.

studies, based on deep photometry with ESO/VLT HAWK-I and FORS2 (zYJH and
Ks-band images, AB(3 sigma)~26-27) on a sample of lensing clusters extracted
from our multi-wavelength combined surveys with SPITZER, HST, and Herschel. In
this paper we focus on the complete Y and J-dropout sample, as well as the
bright z-dropouts fulfilling the selection criteria by Capak et al. (2011). 10
candidates are selected within the common field of ~33 arcmin2 (effective area
once corrected for contamination and lensing dilution). All of them are
detected in H and Ks bands in addition to J and/or IRAC 3.6/4.5, with
H(AB)~23.4 to 25.2, and have modest magnification factors. Although best-fit
photometric redshifts place all these candidates at high-z, the contamination
by low-z interlopers is estimated at 50-75% level based on previous studies,
and the comparison with the blank-field WIRCAM Ultra-Deep Survey (WUDS). The
same result is obtained when photometric redshifts include a luminosity prior,
allowing us to remove half of the original sample as likely z~1.7-3 interlopers
with young stellar pulations and strong extinction. Two additional sources
among the remaining sample could be identified at low-z based on a detection at
24 microns and on the HST z_850 band. These low-z interlopers are not well
described by current templates given the large break, and cannot be easily
identified based solely on optical and near-IR photometry. Given the estimated
dust extinction and high SFRs, some of them could be also detected in the IR or
sub-mm bands. After correction for likely contaminants, the observed counts at
z>7.5 seem to be in agreement with an evolving LF. (abridged)

microquasars. Here, we present the evidence that traces of past occurrences of
this kind of phenomena can be found in normal but once active galaxies. Based
on the properties of a few such ""post-active"" galaxies that are representative
for a much wider group, it has been argued that they have reached the
evolutionary stages when their nuclei, which were radio-loud in the past, now,
mimicking the behaviour of XRBs, remain in the intermediate state on their way
towards quiescence or even have already entered the quiescent state. It follows
that the full evolutionary track of XRBs can be mapped onto the evolution of
galaxies. The above findings are in line with those reported recently for IC
2497, a galaxy that 70,000 years ago or less hosted a quasar but now appears as
a normal one. This scenario stems from the presence of Hanny's Voorwerp, a
nebulous object in its vicinity excited by that QSO in the epoch when IC 2497
was active. The post-active galaxies we deal with here are accompanied by
extremely weak and diffuse relic radio lobes that were inflated during their
former active period. These relics can be regarded as radio analogues of
Hanny's Voorwerp.

parameters. By counting this number, one could quest for the candidate of Dirac
systems without solving the secular equation. The constraints can be provided
by any kinds of symmetry present in the system. The theory also enables the
analytical determination of k-point having accidental contact by selectively
picking up only the degenerate solution of the secular equation. By using these
frameworks, we demonstrate that the Dirac points are feasible in various
two-dimensional lattices, e.g. the anisotropic Kagome lattice under inversion
symmetry is found to have contacts over the whole lattice parameter space.
Spin-dependent cases, such as the spin-density-wave state in LaOFeAs with
reflection symmetry, are also dealt with in the present scheme.

dynamic network model of Kuhn, Lynch and Oshman [STOC '10]. In this model an
adversary adaptively chooses a new network topology in every round, making even
basic distributed computations challenging.
  Kuhn et al. show that n nodes, each starting with a d-bit token, can
broadcast them to all nodes in time O(n^2) using b-bit messages, where b > d +
log n. Their algorithms take the natural approach of {token forwarding}: in
every round each node broadcasts some particular token it knows. They prove
matching Omega(n^2) lower bounds for a natural class of token forwarding
algorithms and an Omega(n log n) lower bound that applies to all
token-forwarding algorithms.
  We use network coding, transmitting random linear combinations of tokens, to
break both lower bounds. Our algorithm's performance is quadratic in the
message size b, broadcasting the n tokens in roughly d/b^2 * n^2 rounds. For b
= d = O(log n) our algorithms use O(n^2/log n) rounds, breaking the first lower
bound, while for larger message sizes we obtain linear-time algorithms. We also
consider networks that change only every T rounds, and achieve an additional
factor T^2 speedup. This contrasts with related lower and upper bounds of Kuhn
et al. implying that for natural token-forwarding algorithms a speedup of T,
but not more, can be obtained. Lastly, we give a general way to derandomize
random linear network coding, that also leads to new deterministic information
