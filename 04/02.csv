demonstrated that they can be extended to a class of polynomially bounded
smooth functions allowing a realization of the full Hopf algebra structure on

emission due to Comptonization of the optical radiation of the companion star

B1259-63/LS 2883 revealed radiation properties of the companion star which
differ significantly from previous measurements. In this paper we study the
implications of these observations for the interaction rate of the unshocked

of the wind is smaller than $10^3$ or larger that $10^5$. The higher luminosity
of the optical star also has two important implications: (i) attenuation of
gamma rays due to photon-photon pair production, and (ii) Compton drag of the
unshocked wind. While the first effect has an impact on the lightcurve of VHE
gamma rays, the second effect may significantly decrease the energy available
for particle acceleration after termination of the wind.

extant for novae in M31 through the end of 2009 and bring to 91 the number of

are confirmed or likely members of the Fe II spectroscopic class, with the
remaining 16 novae (18%) belonging to the He/N (and related) classes. These
numbers are consistent with those found for Galactic novae. We find no
compelling evidence that spectroscopic class depends sensitively on spatial
position or population within M31 (i.e., bulge vs. disk), although the
distribution for He/N systems appears slightly more extended than that for the
Fe II class. We confirm the existence of a correlation between speed class and
ejection velocity (based on line width), as in the case of Galactic novae.
Follow-up photometry allowed us to determine light-curve parameters for a total
of 47 of the 91 novae with known spectroscopic class. We confirm that more
luminous novae generally fade the fastest, and that He/N novae are typically
faster and brighter than their Fe II counterparts. In addition, we find a weak

  in Compressive Sensing","70 Pages, Submitted to Trans. IT",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a new approach for the analysis of iterative
node-based verification-based (NB-VB) recovery algorithms in the context of
compressive sensing. These algorithms are particularly interesting due to their
low complexity (linear in the signal dimension $n$). The asymptotic analysis
predicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\ell$ in
the asymptotic regime where $n \rightarrow \infty$. The analysis is similar in
nature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze
iterative decoding algorithms. To perform the analysis, a message-passing
interpretation of NB-VB algorithms is provided. This interpretation lacks the
extrinsic nature of standard message-passing algorithms to which density
evolution is usually applied. This requires a number of non-trivial
modifications in the analysis. The analysis tracks the average performance of
the recovery algorithms over the ensembles of input signals and sensing
matrices as a function of $\ell$. Concentration results are devised to
demonstrate that the performance of the recovery algorithms applied to any
choice of the input signal over any realization of the sensing matrix follows
the deterministic results of the analysis closely. Simulation results are also
provided which demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic analysis matches the
performance of recovery algorithms for large but finite values of $n$. Compared
to the existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based
on numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the
proposed method is much simpler and more accurate.

that they are correct to leading order for all states in the TCSA system. We
check these results using the TCSA applied to the tri-critical Ising model and
the Yang-Lee model. We also study the TCSA of an irrelevant

coupling constant and energy scales are problematic, the renormalised and
rescaled spectrum remain a very good fit to the exact result, and we find a
numerical relationship between the IR and UV couplings describing a particular

detailed phenomenological probe of No-Scale F-SU(5), a model representing the
intersection of the F-lipped SU(5) X U(1)_X Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with
extra TeV-Scale vector-like multiplets derived out of F-theory, and the
dynamics of No-Scale Supergravity. We present a highly constrained ""Golden""

and M_V = 691 - 1020 GeV, which simultaneously satisfies all known experimental

top-down theoretical analysis of the one-loop effective Higgs potential,
achieving a striking consonance via the dynamic determination of tan(beta) and
M_1/2 at the local secondary minimization of the spontaneously broken
electroweak Higgs vacuum V_min. We present the distinctive signatures of
No-Scale F-SU(5) at the LHC, where a light stop and gluino are expected to
generate a surplus of ultra-high multiplicity (>= 9) hadronic jet events. We
propose modest alterations to the canonical background selection cut strategy
which would enhance resolution of these events, while readily suppressing the
contribution of all Standard Model processes, and allowing a clear
differentiation from competing models of new physics. Detection by the LHC of
the ultra-high jet signal would constitute a suggestive evocation of the
intimately linked stringy origins of F-SU(5), and could provide a glimpse into
the fundamental string moduli, and possibly even the workings of the No-Scale

Specifically, the goal of the learning is to train a classifier using training
data, in such a way that it will be capable of classifying new unseen data
correctly. In order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design
the learner, so it will not overfit the training data. The later can is done
usually by adding a regularization term. The statistical learning theory
explains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the
complexity of the learned model. This explanation, however, is rather abstract
and does not have a geometric intuition. The generalization error of a
classifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations
of the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize
well. Indeed, Xu et al. [2009] have shown that the SVM formulation is
equivalent to a robust optimization (RO) formulation, in which an adversary
displaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined
radius. In this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing
each data point with a Gaussian cloud centered at the sample. Loss is evaluated
as the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. This setup fits
the fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. We
develop an RO framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the
noise. In our algorithm named GURU, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on
the noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative
considerations. Our experiments show that this framework performs as well as
SVM and even slightly better in some cases. Generalizations for Mercer kernels
and for the multiclass case are presented as well. We also show that our
framework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective
functions.

enhanced bispectrum in the local limit. We numerically calculate the local-type
fNL signal in the CMB that would be measured for such models (including the
full transfer function and 2D projection). The nature of the result depends on
several parameters, including the occupation number N_k, the phase angle
\theta_k between the Bogoliubov parameters, and the slow-roll parameter
\epsilon. In the most conservative case, where one takes \theta_k \approx
\eta_0 k (justified by physical reasons discussed within) and \epsilon\lesssim
0.01, we find that 0 < fNL < 1.52 (\epsilon/0.01), which is likely too small to
be detected in the CMB. However, if one is willing to allow a constant value
for the phase angle \theta_k and N_k=O(1), fNL can be much larger and/or
negative (depending on the choice of \theta_k), e.g. fNL \approx 28
(\epsilon/0.01) or -6.4 (\epsilon/0.01); depending on \epsilon, these scenarios
could be detected by Planck or a future satellite. While we show that these

they do produce a value for fNL that is considerably larger than that usually

spiral galaxies are comprised of five different components: dark matter halo,
stellar disc, stellar bulge, gaseous disc and gaseous halo. While the first
four components have been extensively considered in numerical simulations of
binary galaxy mergers, the effect of a hot gaseous halo has usually been
neglected even though it can contain up to 80% of the total gas within the
galaxy virial radius. We present a series of hydrodynamic simulations of major
mergers of disc galaxies, that for the first time include a diffuse, rotating,
hot gaseous halo. Through cooling and accretion, the hot halo can dissipate and
refuel the cold gas disc before and after a merger. This cold gas can
subsequently form stars, thus impacting the morphology and kinematics of the
remnant. Simulations of isolated systems with total mass M~10^12Msun show a
nearly constant star formation rate of ~5Msun/yr if the hot gaseous halo is
included, while the star formation rate declines exponentially if it is
neglected. We conduct a detailed study of the star formation efficiency during
mergers and find that the presence of a hot gaseous halo reduces the starburst
efficiency (e=0.5) compared to simulations without a hot halo (e=0.68).
Moreover we find cases where the stellar mass of the merger remnant is lower
than the sum of the stellar mass of the two progenitor galaxies when evolved in
isolation. This suggests a revision to semi-analytic galaxy formation models
which assume that a merger always leads to enhanced star formation. We show
that adding the hot gas component has a significant effect on the kinematics
and internal structure of the merger remnants, like an increased abundance of
fast rotators and an r^(1/4) surface brightness profile at small scales.

Individual clumps contribute ~0.5%-15% of the galaxy-integrated rest-frame
~5000A emission, with median of about 2%; the total contribution of clump light
ranges from 10%-25%. The median intrinsic clump size and stellar mass are ~1kpc
and log(Mstar[Msun])~9, in the ranges for clumps identified in rest-UV or line
emission in other studies. The clump sizes and masses in the subset of disks
are broadly consistent with expectations for clump formation via gravitational
instabilities in gas-rich, turbulent disks given the host galaxies' global
properties. By combining the NIC2 data with ACS/F814W imaging available for one
source, and AO-assisted SINFONI Halpha data for another, we infer modest color,
M/L, and stellar age variations within each galaxy. In these two objects, sets
of clumps identified at different wavelengths do not fully overlap;
NIC2-identified clumps tend to be redder/older than ACS- or Halpha-identified
clumps without rest-frame optical counterparts. There is evidence for a
systematic trend of older ages at smaller galactocentric radii among the
clumps, consistent with scenarios where inward migration of clumps transports
material towards the central regions. From constraints on a bulge-like
component at radii <1-3kpc, none of the five disks in our sample appears to
contain a compact massive stellar core, and we do not discern a trend of bulge
stellar mass fraction with stellar age of the galaxy. Further observations are
necessary to probe the build-up of stellar bulges and the role of clumps in
this process.

in HCN emission strength seen in the high resolution data can be recovered in
low resolution data. In examining the factors that influence the HCN emission
strength, we find that the low resolution HCN flux is modestly correlated with
stellar accretion rate and X-ray luminosity. Correlations of this kind are
perhaps expected based on recent observational and theoretical studies of inner
disk atmospheres. Our results demonstrate the potential of using the large
number of low resolution disk spectra that reside in the Spitzer archive to
study the factors that influence the strength of molecular emission from disks.
Such studies would complement results for the much smaller number of

of massive stars. Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods
(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the
infalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high
accretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is
commonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion
causes the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and
produce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a
black hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low
accretion rates, the magnetar is in the ""propeller regime"" and avoids becoming
a black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the
magnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial
protoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it
accretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these
types of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically
associated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}
ergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,
which shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s. For
a small ~5 solar mass hydrogen-poor envelope, this energy creates a brighter,
faster evolving supernova with high ejecta velocities ~(1-3)*10^4 km/s and may
appear as a broad-lined Type Ib/c supernova. For a large >10 solar mass
hydrogen-rich envelope, the result is a bright Type IIP supernova with a

at rate $m...N^{-1}$, selection is at rate $s>0$. The system starts in the

$^\ast\CW e^{-\alpha |t|}$ for a positive random variable $^\ast \CW$. The
formation of small droplets of type-2 dominated sites in times $o(\log N)$, or
$\gamma...\log N, \gamma \in (0,\alpha^{-1})$ is described in the limit $N \to

Poissonian type noise which we identify explicitly. The total mass of this
limiting $(N \to \infty)$ droplet process grows like $\CW^\ast e^{\alpha t}$ as

Hamiltonian to determine the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) ground states and
the residual interaction for QRPA, guarantees an excellent decoupling of
spurious strength, without the need for empirical corrections. While work is
under way to include SRG-evolved 3N interactions, we presently account for some
3N effects by means of a linearly density-dependent interaction, whose strength
is adjusted to reproduce the charge radii of closed-shell nuclei across the
whole nuclear chart. As a first application, we perform a survey of the
monopole, dipole, and quadrupole response of the calcium isotopic chain and of
the underlying single-particle spectra, focusing on how their properties depend
on the SRG parameter $\lambda$. Unrealistic spin-orbit splittings suggest that
spin-orbit terms from the 3N interaction are called for. Nevertheless, our
general findings are comparable to results from phenomenological QRPA
calculations using Skyrme or Gogny energy density functionals. Potentially

The only theoretical models which have addressed this puzzle are surface
transport models and flux-transport dynamo models. Comparing polar fields
obtained from numerical simulations using surface flux transport models and
flux-transport dynamo models, we show that both classes of models can explain
the polar field features within the scope of the physics included in the
respective models. In both models, how polar fields change as a result of
changes in meridional circulation depends on the details of meridional
circulation profile used. Using physical reasoning and schematics as well as
numerical solutions from a flux-transport dynamo model, we demonstrate that
polar fields are determined mostly by the strength of surface poloidal source
provided by the decay of tilted, bipolar active regions. Profile of meridional
flow with latitude and its changes with time have much less effect in
flux-transport dynamo models than in surface transport models.

Multiscale: they are based on flow averaging and have a computational cost
determined by mesoscopic steps in space and time instead of microscopic steps
in space and time; (ii) Versatile: the method is based on averaging the flows
of the given PDEs (which may have hidden slow and fast processes). This
bypasses the need for identifying explicitly (or numerically) the slow
variables or reduced effective PDEs; (iii) Nonintrusive: A pre-existing

have discovered a large miscibility gap in the system Ba(Mn_xFe_{1-x})2As2.
Rietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on samples
slow-cooled from 1000 C to room temperature (RT) reveal a two-phase mixture of
BaMn2As2 and Ba(Mn_{0.12}Fe_{0.88})2As2 phases together with impurity phases
for x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8. We infer that there exists a miscibility
gap in this system at 300 K with composition limits 0.12 < x < 1. For samples
quenched from 1000 C to 77 K, the refinements of RT XRD data indicate that the
miscibility gap at RT narrows at 1000 C to 0.2 < x < 0.8. Samples with x=0.4,
0.5 and 0.6 quenched from 1100-1400 C to 77 K contain a single 122-type phase
together with significant amounts of Fe_{1-x}Mn_xAs and FeAs2 impurity phases.
These results indicate that the system is not a pseudo-binary system over the

homogeneity range at these temperatures. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical
resistivity and heat capacity measurements versus temperature of the

here that in a weakly small group, subgroups which are definable with

descending chain conditions for their traces in any finitely generated

find that, while quantum fluctuations decrease the order parameter and critical

conclude from this that DMFT is a good approximation for the antiferromagnetic

two forms of short-term plasticity, namely, short-term depression (STD) and
short-term facilitation (STF). They have time constants residing between fast
neural signaling and rapid learning, and may serve as substrates for neural
systems manipulating temporal information on relevant time scales. The present
study investigates the impact of STD and STF on the dynamics of continuous
attractor neural networks (CANNs) and their potential roles in neural
information processing. We find that STD endows the network with slow-decaying
plateau behaviors-the network that is initially being stimulated to an active
state decays to a silent state very slowly on the time scale of STD rather than
on the time scale of neural signaling. This provides a mechanism for neural
systems to hold sensory memory easily and shut off persistent activities
gracefully. With STF, we find that the network can hold a memory trace of
external inputs in the facilitated neuronal interactions, which provides a way
to stabilize the network response to noisy inputs, leading to improved accuracy
in population decoding. Furthermore, we find that STD increases the mobility of
the network states. The increased mobility enhances the tracking performance of
the network in response to time-varying stimuli, leading to anticipative neural
responses. In general, we find that STD and STP tend to have opposite effects
on network dynamics and complementary computational advantages, suggesting that
the brain may employ a strategy of weighting them differentially depending on
the computational purpose.

spectroscopy (ARPES) study of the tri-layer high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor
(HTSC) Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223), and have shown that
the \textquotedblleft effective\textquotedblright superconducting (SC) gap
$\Delta_{\rm{sc}}$ defined at the end point of the Fermi arc and the $T_c$ (=
110 K) approximately satisfies the weak-coupling BCS-relationship
2$\Delta_{\rm{sc}}$ = 4.3$k_{\rm{B}}T_c$. Combining this result with previous
ARPES results on single- and double-layer cuprates, we show that the
relationship between 2$\Delta_{\rm{sc}}$ = 4.3$k_{\rm{B}}T_c$ holds for various
HTSCs. Furthermore, at $T$ $\sim$ $T_c$, the quasi-patricle width at the end
point of the Fermi arc is found to coincide with $\Delta_{\rm{sc}}$, consistent
with the context of Planckian dissipation.

graphene (semi)metallic or opens up a small gap yet only beyond the mechanical
breaking point of the graphene, contrary to claims in the literature based on
tight-binding (TB) calculations. It is possible, however, to open up a global
gap by a sine-like one-dimensional inhomogeneous deformation applied along any
direction but the armchair one, with the largest gap for the corrugation along
the zigzag direction (~0.5 eV) without any electrostatic gating. The gap
opening has a threshold character with very sharp rise when the ratio of the
amplitude A and the period of the sine wave deformation lambda exceeds
(A/lambda)_c ~0.1 and the inversion symmetry is preserved, while it is
threshold-less when the symmetry is broken, in contrast with TB-derived
pseudo-magnetic field models.

  Conference on Weblogs and Social Media. 9 pages, 4 Figures",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much of the past work in network analysis has focused on analyzing discrete
graphs, where binary edges represent the ""presence"" or ""absence"" of a
relationship. Since traditional network measures (e.g., betweenness centrality)
utilize a discrete link structure, complex systems must be transformed to this
representation in order to investigate network properties. However, in many
domains there may be uncertainty about the relationship structure and any
uncertainty information would be lost in translation to a discrete
representation. Uncertainty may arise in domains where there is moderating link
information that cannot be easily observed, i.e., links become inactive over
time but may not be dropped or observed links may not always corresponds to a
valid relationship. In order to represent and reason with these types of
uncertainty, we move beyond the discrete graph framework and develop social
network measures based on a probabilistic graph representation. More
specifically, we develop measures of path length, betweenness centrality, and
clustering coefficient---one set based on sampling and one based on
probabilistic paths. We evaluate our methods on three real-world networks from
Enron, Facebook, and DBLP, showing that our proposed methods more accurately
capture salient effects without being susceptible to local noise, and that the
resulting analysis produces a better understanding of the graph structure and
the uncertainty resulting from its change over time.

terminal measure in discrete time. Such models are used in financial practice
as parametric versions of the Markov functional model, or as approximations to
the log-normal Libor market model. We show that the model has two distinct
regimes, at high and low volatilities, with different qualitative behavior. The
two regimes are separated by a sharp transition, which is similar to a phase
transition in condensed matter physics. We study the behavior of the model in
the large volatility phase, and discuss the implications of the phase
transition for the pricing of interest rate derivatives. In the large
volatility phase, certain expectation values and convexity adjustments have an
explosive behavior. For sufficiently low volatilities the caplet smile is
log-normal to a very good approximation, while in the large volatility phase
the model develops a non-trivial caplet skew. The phenomenon discussed here
imposes thus an upper limit on the volatilities for which the model behaves as
intended.

phases of slow motion, allowing the searcher to detect the target, and phases
of fast motion during which targets cannot be detected. We first show that
intermittent search strategies are actually widely observed at various scales.
At the macroscopic scale, this is for example the case of animals looking for
food ; at the microscopic scale, intermittent transport patterns are involved
in reaction pathway of DNA binding proteins as well as in intracellular
transport. Second, we introduce generic stochastic models, which show that
intermittent strategies are efficient strategies, which enable to minimize the
search time. This suggests that the intrinsic efficiency of intermittent search
strategies could justify their frequent observation in nature. Last, beyond
these modeling aspects, we propose that intermittent strategies could be used
also in a broader context to design and accelerate search processes.

become topological Kondo insulators, which are Kondo insulators in the bulk,
but have robust Dirac surface states on the boundary. This new family of
topological insulators has two advantages compared to previous ones. First,
they can have good proximity effect with other superconducting FS compounds to
realize Majarona fermions. Second, the antiferromagnetism of CeOs4Sb12 at low
temperature provides a way to realize the massive Dirac fermion with novel
topological phenomena.
