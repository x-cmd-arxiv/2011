structural rule introduced by Gentzen for his sequent formulation of classical
logic. As singular (single-conclusion) cuts yield trees, which underlie
ordinary natural deduction derivations, so plural cuts yield graphs of a more
complicated kind, related to trees, which this paper defines. Besides the
inductive definition of these oriented graphs, which is based on sequent
systems, a non-inductive, graph-theoretical, combinatorial, definition is
given, and to reach that other definition is the main goal of the paper. As
trees underlie multicategories, so the graphs of plural cuts underlie
polycategories. The graphs of plural cuts are interesting in particular when
the plural cuts are appropriate for sequent systems without the structural rule
of permutation, and the main body of the paper deals with that matter. It gives
a combinatorial characterization of the planarity of the graphs involved.

Owing to

spatial resolution is sufficiently high to clearly resolve it, enabling
observations in different regions within the flux concentration. The
possibility to probe various lines of sight around the flux concentration bears
the potential to reveal different modes of the magnetohydrodynamic waves and

in a rotating cylindrical annulus with conical caps is considered with the aim
to establish whether a small fraction of compositional buoyancy added to the
thermal buoyancy (or vice versa) can significantly reduce the critical Rayleigh
number and amplify convection in planetary cores. It is shown that the neutral
surface describing the onset of convection in the double-buoyancy case is
essentially different from that of the well-studied purely thermal case, and
does indeed allow the possibility of low-Rayleigh number convection. In
particular, isolated islands of instability are formed by an additional
""double-diffusive"" eigenmode in certain regions of the parameter space.
However, the amplitude of such low-Rayleigh number convection is relatively
weak. At similar flow amplitudes purely compositional and double-diffusive
cases are characterized by a stronger time dependence compared to purely
thermal cases, and by a prograde mean zonal flow near the inner cylindrical
surface. Implications of the results for planetary core convection are briefly
discussed.

photoemission spectroscopy with synchrotron photons. With increasing Na dose,
the $\pi$ band appears to be quickly diffused into background at 85 K whereas
it becomes significantly enhanced its spectral intensity at room temperature

Fermi energy with Na at 85 K while no such a band observed at RT. Such changes

based on our first principles calculations suggests that the changes of the

at low temperature where the potential becomes periodic due to the crystallized
Na overlayer. The new parabolic band turns to be the $\pi$ band of the

motions is encoded in the travel times of solar waves. The inverse problem
consists of inferring 3-D vector flows from a set of travel-time measurements.
Here we investigate the potential of time-distance helioseismology to infer 3-D
convective velocities in the near-surface layers of the Sun. We developed a new
Subtractive Optimally Localised Averaging (SOLA) code suitable for pipeline
pseudo-automatic processing. Compared to its predecessor, the code was improved
by accounting for additional constraints in order to get the right answer
within a given noise level. The main aim of this study is to validate results
obtained by our inversion code. We simulate travel-time maps using a snapshot
from a numerical simulation of solar convective flows, realistic Born
travel-time sensitivity kernels, and a realistic model of travel-time noise.
These synthetic travel times are inverted for flows and the results compared
with the known input flow field. Additional constraints are implemented in the
inversion: cross-talk minimization between flow components and spatial
localization of inversion coefficients. Using modes f, p1 through p4, we show
that horizontal convective flow velocities can be inferred without bias, at a
signal-to-noise ratio greater than one in the top 3.5 Mm, provided that
observations span at least four days. The vertical component of velocity (v_z),
if it were to be weak, is more difficult to infer and is seriously affected by
cross-talk from horizontal velocity components. We emphasise that this
cross-talk must be explicitly minimised in order to retrieve v_z in the top 1
Mm. We also show that statistical averaging over many different areas of the
Sun allows for reliably measuring of average properties of all three flow
components in the top 5.5 Mm of the convection zone.

O is partially covalent and the covalent nature of the bond decreases as the
concentration of Sr increases from 0 to 100%. It is found that Cd1-xSrxO is an
indirect bandgap compound for the entire range of x and the bandgap of the
alloy increases from 0.85 to 6.00 eV with the increase in Sr concentration.
Frequency dependent dielectric functions {\epsilon}1({\omega}),
{\epsilon}2({\omega}), refractive index n({\omega}) and absorption coefficient
{\alpha}({\omega}) are also calculated and discussed in details. The peak value
of refractive indices shifts to higher energy regions with the increase in Sr.
The striking feature of these alloys is that Cd0.5Sr0.5O is an anisotropic
material. The larger value of the extraordinary refractive index confirms that
the material is positive birefringence crystal. The present comprehensive
theoretical study of the optoelectronic properties of the material predicts
that it can be effectively used in optoelectronic applications in the wide
range of spectrum; IR, visible and UV.

a given smooth manifold. In the 1980s, R. Hamilton proposed an approach to this
question based on parabolic partial differential equations. The goal is to
start from a given initial metric and deform it to a canonical metric by means
of an evolution equation. There are various natural evolution equations for
Riemannian metrics, including the Ricci flow and the conformal Yamabe flow. In
this survey, we discuss the global behavior of the solutions to these
equations. In particular, we describe how these techniques can be used to prove
the Differentiable Sphere Theorem.

grows more slowly than the volume of an observation window, implying that the
local density is effectively homogeneous beyond a few characteristic length
scales. Previous work on maximally random strictly jammed sphere packings in
three dimensions has shown that these systems are hyperuniform and possess
unusual quasi-long-range pair correlations, resulting in anomalous logarithmic
growth in the number variance. However, recent work on maximally random jammed
sphere packings with a size distribution has suggested that such
quasi-long-range correlations and hyperuniformity are not universal among
jammed hard-particle systems. In this paper we show that such systems are
indeed hyperuniform with signature quasi-long-range correlations by
characterizing the more general local-volume-fraction fluctuations. We argue
that the regularity of the void space induced by the constraints of saturation
and strict jamming overcomes the local inhomogeneity of the disk centers to
induce hyperuniformity in the medium with a linear small-wavenumber nonanalytic
behavior in the spectral density, resulting in quasi-long-range spatial
correlations. A numerical and analytical analysis of the pore-size distribution
for a binary MRJ system in addition to a local characterization of the
n-particle loops governing the void space surrounding the inclusions is
presented in support of our argument. This paper is the first part of a series
of two papers considering the relationships among hyperuniformity, jamming, and
regularity of the void space in hard-particle packings.

in a class of adaptive sensory networks. We find that the high frequency noise
is filtered by the output degradation process through time-averaging; while the
low frequency noise is damped by adaptation through negative feedback. Both
filtering processes themselves introduce intrinsic noises, which are found to
be unfiltered and can thus amount to a significant internal noise floor even
without signaling. These results are applied to E. coli chemotaxis. We show
unambiguously that the molecular mechanism for the Berg-Purcell time-averaging
scheme is the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY-P, not the
receptor adaptation process as previously suggested. The high frequency noise
due to the stochastic ligand binding-unbinding events and the random ligand
molecule diffusion is averaged by the CheY-P dephosphorylation process to a
negligible level in E.coli. We identify a previously unstudied noise source
caused by the random motion of the cell in a ligand gradient. We show that this
random walk induced signal noise has a divergent low frequency component, which
is only rendered finite by the receptor adaptation process. For gradients
within the E. coli sensing range, this dominant external noise can be
comparable to the significant intrinsic noise in the system. The dependence of
the response and its fluctuations on the key time scales of the system are
studied systematically. We show that the chemotaxis pathway may have evolved to
optimize gradient sensing, strong response, and noise control in different time
scales

quasi-long-range pair correlations. Our results suggest a strong generalization
of a conjecture by Torquato and Stillinger [Phys. Rev. E. 68, 041113 (2003)],
namely that all strictly jammed saturated packings of hard particles, including
those with size- and shape-distributions, are hyperuniform with signature
quasi-long-range correlations. We show that our arguments concerning the
constrained distribution of the void space in MRJ packings directly extend to
hard ellipse and superdisk packings, thereby providing a direct structural
explanation for the appearance of hyperuniformity and quasi-long-range

media with anisotropic inclusions and show for the first time that one can
decorate a periodic point pattern to obtain a hard-particle system that is not
hyperuniform with respect to local-volume-fraction fluctuations. This apparent
discrepancy can also be rationalized by appealing to the irregular distribution
of the void space arising from the anisotropic shapes of the particles. Our
work suggests the intriguing possibility that the MRJ states of hard particles
share certain universal features independent of the local properties of the
packings, including the packing fraction and average contact number per

stellar tidal disruptions and predict the snapshot rate of these events. For a
small angle between the observer and the jet, our model reproduces the observed
radio flux of the tidal flare candidate GRB 110328A. We find that future radio
surveys will be able to test whether the majority of tidal disruptions are
accompanied by a jet.

remains one of the most compelling and elusive challenges in astronomy.
Coronagraphy, nulling interferometry and free-flying occulters have been
advanced as potential techniques to accomplish this gaol. In this paper, a
complementary approach, coherent interferometry in the far infrared is
considered. For an interferometer operating close to the quantum noise limit, a
collecting area of $\sim$ 1000 m$^{2}$ and baselines of 200 m are sufficient to
detect an earth-like planet. The high spectral resolution achievable with
coherent detection further enables unambiguous molecular inventory of an
atmosphere and retrieval of atmospheric temperature-pressure-composition
profiles. The far-infrared is rich in molecular features, particularly
transitions of the key biosignature molecules H$_2$O and O$_3$. The level of
detail that can be obtained on atmospheres is such that the goals of detection
and detailed characterization of biosignatures can be accomplished by the same
mission. Hitherto, however, the majority of modeling efforts concerning the
extrasolar planet atmospheres has been limited to the visible and thermal
infrared regimes considered for coronagraphs and nulling interferometry. It is
therefore worth seriously investigating the feasibility of such an architecture
for a possible mission, and considering biosignatures that might be available

of larger asteroids (D > 60 km) exhibits an evident excess of prograde
rotators, probably of primordial origin.

the galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.
The resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structure
observed in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. Major mergers are commonly
observed in SMGs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intense
starbursts at high gas consumption rates. This study demonstrates the level of
detail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing the
increase in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by
gravitational lensing.

underlying H2 column density is a long-standing problem in astrophysics. While
the Galactic CO-H2 conversion factor (Xco) appears to be reasonably constant,
observations indicate that Xco may be depressed in high-surface density
starburst environments. Using a multi-scale approach, we investigate the
dependence of Xco on the galactic environment in numerical simulations of disc
galaxies and galaxy mergers. Xco is proportional to the GMC surface density
divided by the integrated CO intensity, Wco, and Wco is related to the kinetic
temperature and velocity dispersion in the cloud. In disc galaxies (except
within the central ~ kpc), the galactic environment is largely unimportant in
setting the physical properties of GMCs provided they are gravitationally
bound. The temperatures are roughly constant at ~10 K due to the balance of CO
cooling and cosmic ray heating, giving a nearly constant CO-H2 conversion
factor in discs. In mergers, the velocity dispersion of the gas rises
dramatically during coalescence. The gas temperature also rises as it couples
well to the warm (~50 K) dust at high densities (n > 10^4 cm^-3). The rise in
velocity dispersion and temperature combine to offset the rise in surface
density in mergers, causing Xco to drop by a factor of ~2-10 compared to the
disc simulation. This model predicts that high-resolution ALMA observations of
nearby ULIRGs should show velocity dispersions of ~10-100 km/s, and brightness
temperatures comparable to the dust temperatures.

$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG), HERMES J105751.1+573027 found in {\it
Herschel}/SPIRE Science Demonstration Phase data from the Herschel Multi-tiered
Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) project. The high resolution imaging available in
optical and Near-IR channels, along with CO emission obtained with the Plateau
de Bure Interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic source
extension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm
0.7$. We measure the half-light radius $R_{\rm eff}$ of the source in the
rest-frame Near-UV and $V$ bands that characterize the unobscured light coming
from stars and find $R_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement with
recent studies on the Submillimeter Galaxy population. This lens model is also
used to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($R_{\rm eff,gas}=
[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the CO (J=5-4) transition
line emission. The lens modeling yields a relatively large Einstein radius
$R_{\rm Ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocity
dispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. This shows that HERMES J105751.1+573027 is
lensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.
The projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget within
the Einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(<R_{\rm Ein})\sim 80%$. This fraction
reduces to $f_{\rm dm}(<R_{\rm eff,G1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within the
effective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $M_{\rm
*,G1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. At this smaller scale the dark matter
fraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensing
ellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the SLACS survey.

SINGS H$\alpha$, 24$\mu$m, THINGS H I and GALEX FUV data for both galaxies, we
investigate the empirical scaling law that connects the surface density of SFR
and cold gas (the Schmidt-Kennicutt law) on a spatially-resolved basis. We
argue that plausibly deriving SFR maps of nearby galaxies requires the diffuse
stellar/dust background emission to be carefully subtracted. An approach to
complete this task is presented and applied in our pixel-by-pixel analysis on
both galaxies, showing that the controversial results whether the molecular S-K
law is super-linear or basically linear is a result of removing or preserving
the local background. In both galaxies, the power index of the molecular S-K
law is 1.5-1.9 at the highest available resolution (230 pc), and decreases
monotonically for decreasing resolution; while the scatter (mainly intrinsic)
increases as the resolution becomes higher, indicating a trend for which the
S-K law breaks down below some scale. Both quantities are systematically larger
in M51a than in NGC 3521, but when plotted against the de-projected scale
(\delta_{dp}), they become highly consistent between the two galaxies,
tentatively suggesting that the sub-kpc molecular S-K law in spiral galaxies
depends only on the considered scale, without varying amongst spiral galaxies.
A logarithmic function \gamma_{H_2}=-1.1 log[\delta_{dp}/kpc]+1.4 and a linear
relation \sigma_{H_2}=-0.2 [\delta_{dp}/kpc]+0.7 are obtained through fitting
to the M51a data, which describes both galaxies impressively well on sub-kpc
scales. A larger sample of galaxies with better quality data are required to
test the general applicability of these relations.

the radion field. We consider the viability of the KK-radion as a DM candidate
in the context of thermal and non-thermal production in the early universe. In
the thermal case, the KK-radion can account for the observed DM density when
the radion decay constant is in the natural multi-TeV range. We also explore
the effects of coannihilations with the first KK excitation of the RH top, as
well as the effects of radion-Higgs mixing, which imply mixing between the
KK-radion and a KK-Higgs (both being KK-parity odd). The non-thermal scenario,
with a high radion decay constant, can also lead to a viable scenario provided
the reheat temperature and the radion decay constant take appropriate values,
although the reheat temperature should not be much higher than the TeV scale.
Direct detection is found to be feasible if the DM has a small (KK-parity odd)
Higgs admixture. Indirect detection via a photon signal from the galactic
center is an interesting possibility, while the positron and neutrino fluxes
from KK-radion annihilations are expected to be rather small. Colliders can
probe characteristic aspects of the DM sector of warped scenarios with
KK-parity, such as the degeneracy between the radion and the KK-radion (DM)

suppression of the dynamics, known as the Zeno effect. Alternatively,
generalized nonprojective, so-called ""weak"" measurements can be carried out.
Such a measurement is parameterized by its strength parameter that can
interpolate continuously between the ideal strong measurement with no
dynamics-the strict Zeno effect, and a weak measurement characterized by almost
free dynamics but blurry observations. Here we analyze the stochastic
properties of this uncertainty component in the resulting observation
trajectory. The observation uncertainty results from intrinsic quantum
uncertainty, the effect of measurement on the system (backaction) and detector
noise. It is convenient to separate the latter, system-independent contribution
from the system-dependent uncertainty, and this paper shows how to accomplish
this separation. The system-dependent uncertainty is found in terms of a
quasi-probability, which, despite its weaker properties, is shown to satisfy a
weak positivity condition. We discuss the basic properties of this
quasi-probability with special emphasis on its time correlation functions as
well as their relationship to the full correlation functions along the
observation trajectory, and illustrate our general results with simple
examples.We demonstrate a violation of classical macrorealism using the
fourth-order time correlation functions with respect to the quasi-probability
in the twolevel system.

partition function that neglects pseudoknots, we calculate folding free
energies and minimum free energy configurations based on the experimentally
derived base pairing free energies. The configurational entropy of loop
formation is modeled by the asymptotic expression -c ln m, where m is the
length of the loop and c the loop exponent, which is an adjustable constant.
Salt effects enter in two ways: first, we derive salt induced modifications of
the free energy parameters for describing base pairing and, second, we include
the electrostatic free energy for loop formation. Both effects are modeled on
the Debye-Hueckel level including counterion condensation. We validate our
theory for two different RNA sequences: For tRNA-phe, the resultant heat
capacity curves for thermal denaturation at various salt concentrations
accurately reproduce experimental results. For the P5ab RNA hairpin, we derive
the global phase diagram in the three-dimensional space spanned by temperature,

the goal is for point guards in fixed positions to rotate searchlights to catch
an evasive intruder. Here the problem is extended to 3D polyhedra, with the
guards now boundary segments who rotate half-planes of illumination. After
carefully detailing the 3D model, several results are established. The first is
a nearly direct extension of the planar one-way sweep strategy using what we
call exhaustive guards, a generalization that succeeds despite there being no
well-defined notion in 3D of planar ""clockwise rotation"". Next follow two
results: every polyhedron with r>0 reflex edges can be searched by at most r^2
suitably placed guards, whereas just r guards suffice if the polyhedron is
orthogonal. (Minimizing the number of guards to search a given polyhedron is

the fluctuations measured with the \SiI\ $\lambda$ 10827 \AA\ line. The results
of the simulations are compared with the oscillations observed simultaneously
at different heights from the \HeI\ $\lambda$ 10830 \AA\ line, the \CaIIH\ core
and the \FeI\ blends in the wings of the \CaIIH\ line. The simulations show a
remarkable agreement with the observations. They reproduce the velocity maps
and power spectra at the formation heights of the observed lines, as well as
the phase and amplification spectra between several pair of lines. We find that
the stronger shocks at the chromosphere are accompanied with a delay between
the observed signal and the simulated one at the corresponding height,
indicating that shocks shift the formation height of the chromospheric lines to
higher layers. Since the simulated wave propagation matches very well the
properties of the observed one, we are able to use the numerical calculations
to quantify the energy contribution of the magneto-acoustic waves to the
chromospheric heating in sunspots. Our findings indicate that the energy
supplied by these waves is too low to balance the chromospheric radiative
losses. The energy contained at the formation height of the lowermost \SiI\
$\lambda$ 10827 \AA\ line in the form of slow magneto-acoustic waves is already
insufficient to heat the higher layers, and the acoustic energy which reaches
the chromosphere is around 3-9 times lower than the required amount of energy.
The contribution of the magnetic energy is even lower.

shapes implicitly using distance transforms, and registration error is defined
based on the shape contours' mutual distances. In addition, we model global
shape deformation as an approximation blended from local deformation fields
using partition-of-unity. The global deformation field is regularized by
penalizing inconsistencies between local fields. The representation can be made
adaptive to shape's contour, leading to registration that is both flexible and
efficient. Finally, registration is achieved by minimizing a variational
chamfer-energy functional combined with the consistency regularizer. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of experiments.

and its reflection from a ferrofluid, which we regard as a magnetically tunable
system of dense random dielectric scatterers with weak dissipation. Partial
spatial ordering is introduced by the application of a transverse magnetic
field that superimposes a periodic modulation on the dielectric randomess. This
introduces Bragg scattering which effectively enhances the scattering due to
disorder alone, and thus reduces the elastic mean free path towards Anderson
localization. Our theoretical treatment, based on invariant imbedding, gives a
simultaneous decrease of transmission and reflection without change of incident
linear polarisation as the spatial order is tuned magnetically to the Bragg
condition, namely the light wave vector being equal to half the Bragg vector
(Q). Our experimental observations are in qualitative agreement with these
results. We have also given expressions for the transit (sojourn) time of light
and for the light energy stored in the random medium under steady illumination.
The ferrofluid thus provides an interesting physical realization of effectively
a ""Lossy Anderson-Bragg"" (LAB) cavity with which to study the effect of the
interplay of spatial disorder, partial order and weak dissipation on light
transport. Given the current interest in propagation, optical limiting and
storage of light in ferrofluids, the present work seems topical.

and for steeper emissivity (index beta of the radial profile). We compare the
expected level of variability for the viewing angle 81.6 deg, as inferred for
NGC 4258, with the case of moderate viewing angles about 30 deg, typical for
Seyfert type-1 galaxies. Highly inclined sources such as this one are
particularly suitable to test the flare model because the effects of orbital
motion, Doppler boosting and light bending are all expected to have maximum
when the accretion disk is seen almost edge-on. The model is consistent with
the NGC 4258 variability, where the obscuring material is thought to be
localized mainly towards the equatorial plane rather than forming a
geometrically thick torus. Once the intrinsic time-scales of the flare duration
are determined to better precision, this kind of highly inclined objects with a
precisely known mass of the black hole can be used to set independent
constraints on the spin parameter.

redshift galaxy-absorber pair detected to-date, supporting the idea that
galaxy-wide outflows were already in place at the end of the epoch of

metals, consistent with models of outflows at lower redshift where significant
observational evidence relates metal absorption systems with galaxies hosting
outflows.
  In a typical outflow scenario, a wind of 200 km/s, active since the universe
was only 0.6 Gyr old (z ~8.4), could eject metals out to 79 kpc at z=5.719.
Although the origin of metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) is still under
debate, our results are consistent with predictions from cosmological
simulations which reproduce the evolution of the cosmic density of Civ, from z
~ 6 to the present day based on outflow-driven enrichment of the IGM.

manganite system $La_{1.2}Sr_{1.8}Mn_{2}O_{7}$ as an approximate minimal model,
is studied both below and above the bulk magnetic transition temperature using
the semi-classical Monte Carlo-molecular dynamics technique. The quantities
studied are:- (i) the static spin configurations, (ii) the spin
auto-correlation function (SAF) $C(t)$ and (iii) the dynamical structure
function (DSF) $S(\bf q, \omega)$. The major aim is to probe the nature of
collective modes and in particular to ascertain whether the propagating modes
can exist above the ordering temperature. We find that the typical spin
configurations contain a high degree of mis-aligned spins, particularly in the
high temperature phase. Nevertheless, in the low temperature phase a long range
ferromagnetic ordering can be seen. The shape of the curves corresponding to
$S(\bf q, \omega)$ vs. $\omega$ in the constant $\bf q$-scan are found in
general to be quite complex viz. containing peaks, cusps and broad plateau.
Moreover, in a large regime of $(\bf q, \omega)$ space, $S(\bf q ,\omega)$ is
found to be negative, signalling a total breakdown of the semi-classical
approximation in the presence of the enormous thermodynamic and quantum
fluctuations. Considering the physically allowed regime only, we can
theoretically extract an effective $\omega$ vs. $q$ dispersion curve for the
collective excitations, which exhibits a slope opposite to that expected for a
full three-dimensional system and disagrees with the results of inelastic
neutron scattering experiments in the nature of the dispersion curve along the
$<100>$ direction in the ordered phase. The theoretical results also exhibit
the existence of propagating modes even in the high temperature (disordered)
phase from our calculations based on a minimal single bi-layer ferromagnetic
model.

directions while in the time-radial section fourth order finite differencing,
along with the method of lines, is applied. The evolution of various types of
stationary and non-stationary pure multipole initial states are investigated.
The asymptotic decay rates are determined not only in the domain of outer
communication but along the event horizon and at future null infinity as well.
The decay rates are found to be different for stationary and non-stationary
initial data, and they also depend on the fall off properties of the initial
data toward future null infinity. The energy and angular momentum transfers are
found to show significantly different behavior in the initial phase of the time
evolution. The quasinormal ringing phase and the tail phase are also
investigated. In the tail phase, the decay exponents for the energy and angular
momentum losses at future null infinity are found to be smaller than at the
horizon which is in accordance with the behavior of the field itself and it
means that at late times the energy and angular momentum falling into the black
hole become negligible in comparison with the energy and angular momentum
radiated toward future null infinity. The energy and angular momentum balances
are used as additional verifications of the reliability of our numerical

thin hydrogen envelopes. In order to form an sdB, the progenitor has to lose
almost all of its hydrogen envelope right at the tip of the red giant branch.
In binary systems, mass transfer to the companion provides the extraordinary
mass loss required for their formation. However, apparently single sdBs exist
as well and their formation is unclear since decades. The merger of helium
white dwarfs leading to an ignition of core helium-burning or the merger of a
helium core and a low mass star during the common envelope phase have been
proposed. Here we report the discovery of EC 22081-1916 as a fast rotating,
single sdB star of low gravity. Its atmospheric parameters indicate, that the
hydrogen envelope must be unusually thick, which is at variance with the He-WD

real-life applications. This paper is concerned with a natural modification of
the classical pattern matching problem inspired by the popularity of such
compression methods: given an uncompressed pattern s[1..m] and a Lempel-Ziv
representation of a string t[1..N], does s occur in t? Farach and Thorup gave a
randomized O(nlog^2(N/n)+m) time solution for this problem, where n is the size
of the compressed representation of t. We improve their result by developing a
faster and fully deterministic O(nlog(N/n)+m) time algorithm with the same
space complexity. Note that for highly compressible texts, log(N/n) might be of
order n, so for such inputs the improvement is very significant. A (tiny)
fragment of our method can be used to give an asymptotically optimal solution
for the substring hashing problem considered by Farach and Muthukrishnan.

the concomitant non-adiabatic energy losses nevertheless never exceed about 5%

adiabatic description of the predominant heat dissipation into the phononic

the O2 spin transition during the dissociation process.

studies of graph problems. It has been recognized that, especially in practical

apply an array of preprocessing rules that simplify and shrink it. This work
seeks to prove rigorous performance guarantees for such preprocessing rules,
both known and new ones, by studying them in the framework of kernelization
from parameterized complexity.
  It is known that the NP-complete problem of determining whether a given graph
G has treewidth at most k admits no polynomial-time preprocessing algorithm
that reduces any input instance to size polynomial in k, unless NP is in
coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level. In this
paper we therefore consider structural graph measures larger than treewidth,
and determine whether efficient preprocessing can shrink the instance size to a
polynomial in such a parameter value.
  We prove that given an instance (G,k) of treewidth we can efficiently reduce
its size to O(fvs(G)^4) vertices, where fvs(G) is the size of a minimum
feedback vertex set in G. We can also prove a size reduction to O(vc(G)^3)
vertices, where vc(G) is the size of a minimum vertex cover. Phrased in the
language of parameterized complexity, we show that Treewidth has a polynomial
kernel when parameterized by the size of a given feedback vertex set, and also
by the size of a vertex cover. In contrast we show that Treewidth parameterized
by the vertex-deletion distance to a single clique, and Weighted Treewidth
parameterized by the size of a vertex cover, do not admit polynomial
kernelizations unless NP is in coNP/poly.

Beta generated distribution (Jones (2004)). In this work we pay attention to
three other generalizations of the SN distribution: the Balakrishnan
skew-normal (SNB) (Balakrishnan (2002), as a discussant of Arnold and Beaver
(2002), Gupta and Gupta (2004), Sharafi and Behboodian (2008)), the generalized
Balakrishnan skew-normal (GBSN) (Yadegari et al. (2008)) and a two parameter
generalization of the Balakrishnan skew-normal (TBSN) (Bahrami et al. (2009)).
The above three extensions are related to the Beta skew-normal distribution for
particular values of the parameters. The paper is organized as follows: after
describing briefly, in Section 2, the skew-normal distribution, its
generalizations and listing their most important properties, in Section 3 we
present some generalizations of the Beta distribution. In the last Section we
define the Beta skew-normal distribution, we present its properties and some
special cases. In particular the BSN contains the Beta half-normal distribution
(Pescim et al. (2010)) as limiting case. Besides, we investigate its shape
properties. We derive its moment generating function and we also compute
numerically the first moment, the variance, the skewness and the kurtosis. We
present two different methods which allow to simulate a BSN distribution. We
explore its relationships with the other generalizations of the SN. We give
some results concerning the SNB distribution. In particular we derive the exact
distributions of the largest order statistic from SNB with parameters m and 1

the number k of vertex-deletions needed to make the graph chordal. We obtain
various upper and lower bounds for kernels of such parameterizations of

molecular noise. Here we investigate the effect of varying noise in a model

this noise-induced stabilization effect. Our results show that an optimal noise
level enhances the regularity (coherence) of the cycles, in a form of coherence

MIMO links, which aim at minimizing the BS usages and reducing the interfering
range, while satisfying diverse statistical delay-QoS constraints characterized
by the delay-bound violation probability and the effective capacity technique.
In particular, based on the channel state information (CSI) and QoS
requirements, a subset of BS with variable cardinality for the distributed MIMO
transmission is dynamically selected, where the selections are controlled by a
central server. For the single-user scenario, we develop two optimization
frameworks, respectively, to derive the efficient BS-selection schemes and the
corresponding resource allocation algorithms. One framework uses the
incremental BS-selection and time-sharing (IBS-TS) strategies, and the other
employs the ordered-gain based BS-selection and probabilistic transmissions
(OGBS-PT). The IBS-TS framework can yield better performance, while the scheme
developed under the OGBS-PT framework is easier to implement. For the
multi-user scenario, we propose the optimization framework applying the
priority BS-selection, block-diagonalization precoding, and probabilistic
transmission (PBS-BD-PT) techniques. We also propose the optimization framework
applying the priority BS-selection, time-division-multiple-access, and
probabilistic transmission (PBS-TDMA-PT) techniques. We derive the optimal

conducted is a set of simulation evaluations which compare our proposed schemes
with several baseline schemes and show the impact of the delay-QoS
requirements, transmit power, and traffic loads on the performances of BS

financial distress through the network. Preliminary simulations indicate that
default by a single relatively small country like Greece can be absorbed by the

range. This raises the question about the dominant emission mechanisms in the
high-energy domain. Spectral analysis allows us to put constraints on the
possible emission processes. Here we study the hard X-ray emission as measured
by INTEGRAL in the 3-1000 keV energy range, in order to distinguish between a
thermal and non-thermal inverse Compton process. The hard X-ray spectrum of Cen
A shows a significant cut-off at energies Ec = 434 (+106 -73) keV with an
underlying power law of photon index 1.73 +- 0.02. A more physical model of
thermal Comptonisation (compPS) gives a plasma temperature of kT = 206+-62 keV
within the optically thin corona with Compton parameter y = 0.42 (+0.09 -0.06).
The reflection component is significant at the 1.9 sigma level with R = 0.12
(+0.09 -0.10), and a reflection strength R>0.3 can be excluded on a 3 sigma
level. Time resolved spectral studies show that the flux, absorption, and
spectral slope varied in the range f(3-30 keV) = (1.2 - 9.2)e-10 erg/cm**2/s,
NH = (7 - 16)e22 1/cm**2, and photon index 1.75 - 1.87. Extending the cut-off
power law or the Comptonisation model to the gamma-ray range shows that they
cannot account for the high-energy emission. On the other hand, also a broken
or curved power law model can represent the data, therefore a non-thermal
origin of the X-ray to GeV emission cannot be ruled out. The analysis of the
SPI data provides no sign of significant emission from the radio lobes and
gives a 3 sigma upper limit of f(40-1000 keV) < 0.0011 ph/cm**2/s. While
gamma-rays, as detected by CGRO and Fermi, are caused by non-thermal (jet)
processes, the main process in the hard X-ray emission of Cen A is still not
unambiguously determined, being either dominated by thermal inverse Compton
emission, or by non-thermal emission from the base of the jet.

measurement of the charge distribution induced on its cathodes. In practical
applications of this read-out method, the algorithm to relate the measured
charge distribution to the avalanche position is an important factor for the
achievable position resolution and for the track reconstruction efficiency. An
algorithm was developed for operating two large-sized MWPCs in a strong

is a viable alternative to local methods in free-space scattering problems.
However, it often suffers from the extremely slow convergence of iterative
methods, especially in the transverse electric (TE) case with large or negative
permittivity. We identify the nontrivial essential spectrum of the pertaining
integral operator as partly responsible for this behavior, and the main reason
why a normally efficient deflating preconditioner does not work. We solve this
problem by applying an explicit multiplicative regularizing operator, which
transforms the system to the form `identity plus compact', yet allows the
resulting matrix-vector products to be carried out at the FFT speed. Such a
regularized system is then further preconditioned by deflating an apparently
stable set of eigenvalues with largest magnitudes, which results in a robust
acceleration of the restarted GMRES under constraint memory conditions.

intervals were covered by INTEGRAL, during which the source showed strong
spectral evolution. We studied the broad-band X-ray spectra in detail by
fitting several models in the different sections of the hardness-intensity
diagram. The soft states are characterised by prominent blackbody emission plus
a contribution from a Comptonized emission. The hard states are characterised
by the presence of an excess flux with respect to the Comptonization model
above 50 keV while the soft component is fainter. To obtain an acceptable fit
to the data this excess is modeled either with a power law with photon index
Gamma ~ 2 or a Comptonization (CompPS) spectrum implying the presence of hybrid
thermal and non-thermal electrons in a corona. This makes 4U 1728-34 one of the
few LMXBs of atoll type showing non-thermal emission at high energy. From our
analysis, it is also apparent that the presence of the hard tail is more
prominent as the overall spectrum becames harder. We discuss also alternative
models which can discribe these hard states.

at unimolecular reactions in gas phase where they are crucial for
equilibration. As equilibration means an increase of entropy, the mechanism can
also be considered responsible for entropy production. Theoretical treatments
show a remarkable agreement with experiments. They rest upon the assumption of
stochastic quantum transitions. Under this premise, master equations have been
used that are known to deliver equilibria and entropy production.
  Here we examine the hypothesis that the ubiquitous inelastic interactions in
gas and liquid phase may represent a source of entropy beyond chemical
reactions, rotational activation/deactivation being the prevailing mechanism in
gas dynamics at room temperature. For a quantum mechanical two-state model the
master equations are formulated which yield entropy production and
equilibration in translational degrees of freedom until, at conserved energy, a
stationary Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is reached.
  The relaxation rates show features that can be checked by monitoring thermal
relaxation in gas phase. Depending on the composition, first or second order
processes are predicted. The temperature dependence is determined by the
activation energy of the lowest transition. Thus, experimental verification
will allow to decide to which extent this hypothesis describes thermal
relaxation. It would support a connection between the macroscopic second law of
thermodynamics and the microscopic stochastic collapse in quantum mechanics,
both experimentally secured facts which in theory emerge as special elements
beyond Hamiltonian dynamics.
  It is also shown that inelastic collisions are connected with
velocity-dependent forces and result in a new analog of the Fokker-Planck
equation where they replace Langevin dynamics as a non-Hamiltonian dissipative
mechanism.

prefixies (resp. suffixies) of length k-1 are equal as well. The size of the

materials acting as topological insulators have attracted wide attention.
Shortly after the theoretical proposal for a mercury telluride (HgTe)-based
two-dimensional topological insulator, the observation of the quantum spin Hall
effect and non-local edge transport brought compelling experimental evidence
for quantized conductance due to edges states. The spin orientation and
propagation direction of such helical edge states are inherently connected,
providing protection against backscattering. However, these features conversely
render controlled spin operations such as spin switching difficult. Here we
therefore propose constrictions as connectors between opposite edge (and spin)
states in HgTe. We demonstrate how the coupling between edge states, which
overlap in the constriction, can be employed both for steering the charge flow
into different edge modes and for controlled spin switching. This gives rise to
a three-state charge and spin transistor function. Unlike in a conventional
spin transistor, the switching does not rely on a tunable Rashba spin-orbit
interaction, but on the energy dependence of the edge state wavefunctions.
Based on this mechanism, and supported by numerical transport calculations, we
present two different ways to control spin- and charge-currents depending on
the gating of the constriction.

introduced by Dung (Artificial Intelligence 177, 1995) has become one of the

main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable
sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (J.
Logic Comput. 13, 2003), extends Dung's framework. It takes into account the
relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an
audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect
to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to
all audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively
accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the
problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main
computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In
this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems
for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes
are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying
graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the
acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that
where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007).

for the single particle Green's function of ballistic graphene structures in
terms of multiple reflections from the system boundary, that allows for a
natural treatment of edge effects. We first apply this formalism to calculate
the average density of states of graphene billiards. While the leading term in
the corresponding Weyl expansion is proportional to the billiard area, we find
that the contribution that usually scales with the total length of the system
boundary differs significantly from what one finds in semiconductor-based,
Schr\""odinger type billiards: The latter term vanishes for armchair and
infinite mass edges and is proportional to the zigzag edge length, highlighting
the prominent role of zigzag edges in graphene. We then compute analytical
expressions for the density of states oscillations and energy levels within a
trajectory based semiclassical approach. We derive a Dirac version of
Gutzwiller's trace formula for classically chaotic graphene billiards and
further obtain semiclassical trace formulae for the density of states
oscillations in regular graphene cavities. We find that edge dependent
interference of pseudospins in graphene crucially affects the quantum spectrum.

These curved Gabor filters enable the choice of filter parameters which
increase the smoothing power without creating artifacts in the enhanced image.
In this paper, curved Gabor filters are applied to the curved ridge and valley
structure of low-quality fingerprint images. First, we combine two orientation
field estimation methods in order to obtain a more robust estimation for very
noisy images. Next, curved regions are constructed by following the respective
local orientation and they are used for estimating the local ridge frequency.
Lastly, curved Gabor filters are defined based on curved regions and they are
applied for the enhancement of low-quality fingerprint images. Experimental
results on the FVC2004 databases show improvements of this approach in
comparison to state-of-the-art enhancement methods.
