field low-rank matrix given random linear measurements of it. These linear
measurements are obtained by taking inner products of the low-rank matrix with
random sensing matrices. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of
measurements required are provided. It is shown that these conditions are sharp
and the minimum-rank decoder is asymptotically optimal. The reliability
function of this decoder is also derived by appealing to de Caen's lower bound
on the probability of a union. The sufficient condition also holds when the
sensing matrices are sparse - a scenario that may be amenable to efficient
decoding. More precisely, it is shown that if the n\times n-sensing matrices
contain, on average, \Omega(nlog n) entries, the number of measurements
required is the same as that when the sensing matrices are dense and contain
entries drawn uniformly at random from the field. Analogies are drawn between
the above results and rank-metric codes in the coding theory literature. In
fact, we are also strongly motivated by understanding when minimum rank
distance decoding of random rank-metric codes succeeds. To this end, we derive
distance properties of equiprobable and sparse rank-metric codes. These
distance properties provide a precise geometric interpretation of the fact that
the sparse ensemble requires as few measurements as the dense one. Finally, we
provide a non-exhaustive procedure to search for the unknown low-rank matrix.

as osteoporosis and multiple myeloma.
  Computational and mathematical modeling can aid in therapy and treatment as
well as understanding fundamental biology. Different approaches to modeling
give insight into different aspects of a phenomena so it is useful to have an
arsenal of various computational and mathematical models.
  Here we develop a mathematical representation of bone remodeling that can
effectively describe many aspects of the complicated geometries and spatial
behavior observed.
  There is a sharp interface between bone and marrow regions. Also the surface
of bone moves in and out, i.e. in the normal direction, due to remodeling.
Based on these observations we employ the use of a level-set function to
represent the spatial behavior of remodeling. We elaborate on a temporal model
for osteoclast and osteoblast population dynamics to determine the change in
bone mass which influences how the interface between bone and marrow changes.
  We exhibit simulations based on our computational model that show the motion
of the interface between bone and marrow as a consequence of bone remodeling.
The simulations show that it is possible to capture spatial behavior of bone
remodeling in complicated geometries as they occur \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in
vivo}.
  By employing the level set approach it is possible to develop computational
and mathematical representations of the spatial behavior of bone remodeling. By
including in this formalism further details, such as more complex cytokine
interactions and accurate parameter values, it is possible to obtain
simulations of phenomena related to bone remodeling with spatial behavior much
as \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo}. This makes it possible to perform
\emph{in silica} experiments more closely resembling experimental observations.

of the downward-traveling wave energy flux from reaching the deep solar

vertical propagation is restricted by successive reflections at the upper and
lower boundaries. The presence of both upward- and downward-traveling
disturbances inside the duct leads to the existence of a set of horizontally
propagating modes that have significantly enhanced amplitudes. We point out
that the helical structure of these waves makes them capable of generating an
alpha-effect, and briefly consider the possibility that propagation in a shear

long times are dictated by quantum mechanics. Non-exponential decay is known to
arise due to the possibility of reconstructing the initial state from the
decaying products. We discuss the quantum decay dynamics by tunneling of a
many-particle system, characterizing the long-time non-exponential behavior of
the non-escape and survival probabilities. The effects of contact interactions
and quantum statistics are described. It is found that whereas for
non-interacting bosons the long-time decay follows a power-law with an exponent
linear in the number of particles $\N$, the exponent becomes quadratic in $\N$
in the fermionic case. The same results apply to strongly interacting many-body
systems related by the generalized Bose-Fermi duality. The faster fermionic
decay can be traced back to the effective hard-core interactions between
particles, which are as well the decaying products, and exhibit spatial
anti-bunching which hinders the reconstruction of the initial unstable state.
The results are illustrated with a paradigmatic model of quantum decay from a
trap allowing leaks by tunneling, whose dynamics is described exactly by means
of an expansion in resonant states.

  Compounds","13 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chinese characters can be compared to a molecular structure: a character is
analogous to a molecule, radicals are like atoms, calligraphic strokes
correspond to elementary particles, and when characters form compounds, they
are like molecular structures. In chemistry the conjunction of all of these
structural levels produces what we perceive as matter. In language, the
conjunction of strokes, radicals, characters, and compounds produces meaning.
But when does meaning arise? We all know that radicals are, in some sense, the
basic semantic components of Chinese script, but what about strokes?
Considering the fact that many characters are made by adding individual strokes
to (combinations of) radicals, we can legitimately ask the question whether
strokes carry meaning, or not. In this talk I will present my project of
extending traditional NLP techniques to radicals and strokes, aiming to obtain
a deeper understanding of the way ideographic languages model the world.

poorly understood, due to the low image cadence and sensitivity of previous EUV

the trajectory and morphology of CBFs was determined in order to investigate
the varying properties of a sample of CBFs, including their kinematics and
pulse shape, dispersion, and dissipation. We have developed a semi-automatic
intensity profiling technique to extract the morphology and accurate positions
of CBFs in 2.5-10 min cadence images from STEREO/EUVI. The technique was
applied to sequences of 171A and 195A images from STEREO/EUVI in order to
measure the wave properties of four separate CBF events. Following launch at
velocities of ~240-450kms^{-1} each of the four events studied showed
significant negative acceleration ranging from ~ -290 to -60ms^{-2}. The CBF
spatial and temporal widths were found to increase from ~50 Mm to ~200 Mm and
~100 s to ~1500 s respectively, suggesting that they are dispersive in nature.
The variation in position-angle averaged pulse-integrated intensity with
propagation shows no clear trend across the four events studied. These results
are most consistent with CBFs being dispersive magnetoacoustic waves.

kinetics. In particular, the slow rate and poor automation of available
analysis tools have bottlenecked a new generation of studies involving hundreds
of CE profiles per experiment.
  Results: We propose a computational method called high-throughput robust
analysis for capillary electrophoresis (HiTRACE) to automate the key tasks in
large-scale nucleic acid CE analysis, including the profile alignment that has
heretofore been a rate-limiting step in the highest throughput experiments. We
illustrate the application of HiTRACE on thirteen data sets representing 4
different RNAs, three chemical modification strategies, and up to 480 single
mutant variants; the largest data sets each include 87,360 bands. By applying a
series of robust dynamic programming algorithms, HiTRACE outperforms prior
tools in terms of alignment and fitting quality, as assessed by measures
including the correlation between quantified band intensities between replicate
data sets. Furthermore, while the smallest of these data sets required 7 to 10
hours of manual intervention using prior approaches, HiTRACE quantitation of
even the largest data sets herein was achieved in 3 to 12 minutes. The HiTRACE
method therefore resolves a critical barrier to the efficient and accurate
analysis of nucleic acid structure in experiments involving tens of thousands
of electrophoretic bands.

the flow allows us to follow the hydrodynamical/magnetohydrodynamical evolution
of an astrophysical plasma system in which ionization and radiative cooling
play significant roles. Cooling zones behind the shocks are resolved, so it is
possible to identify which way material flows through a given shock wave. The
images show that heterogeneity is paramount in these jets, with clumps
dominating the morphologies of both bow shocks and their Mach disks. This
clumpiness exists on scales smaller than the jet widths and determines the
behavior of many of the features in the jets. Evidence also exists for
considerable shear as jets interact with their surrounding molecular clouds,
and in several cases we observe shock waves as they form and fade where
material emerges from the source and as it proceeds along the beam of the jet.
Fine-structure within two extended bow shocks may result from Mach stems that
form at the intersection points of oblique shocks within these clumpy objects.
Taken together, these observations represent the most significant foray thus
far into the time domain for stellar jets, and comprise one of the richest data
sets in existence for comparing the behavior of a complex astrophysical plasma
flows with numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.

superconductivity is the presence of a ""pseudogap"" in the density of states,
whose origin has been debated since its discovery [1]. Some believe the
pseudogap is a broken symmetry state distinct from superconductivity [2-4],
while others believe it arises from short-range correlations without symmetry
breaking [5,6]. A number of broken symmetries have been imaged and identified
with the pseudogap state [7,8], but it remains crucial to disentangle any
electronic symmetry breaking from pre-existing structural symmetry of the
crystal. We use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to observe an orthorhombic
structural distortion across the cuprate superconducting Bi2Sr2Can-1CunO2n+4+x
(BSCCO) family tree, which breaks two-dimensional inversion symmetry in the
surface BiO layer. Although this inversion symmetry breaking structure can
impact electronic measurements, we show from its insensitivity to temperature,

late-time behavior of correlators in time-dependent interacting massive scalar

Krotov and Polyakov in which the coupling $g$ turns on smoothly at finite time,
starting from $g=0$ in the far past where the state is taken to be the (free)
Bunch-Davies vacuum. Our main result is that the resulting correlators (which
we compute at the one-loop level) approach those of the interacting
Hartle-Hawking state at late times. We argue that similar results should hold
for other physically-motivated choices of initial conditions. This behavior is
to be expected from recent quantum ""no hair"" theorems for interacting massive
scalar field theory in de Sitter space which established similar results to all
orders in perturbation theory for a dense set of states in the Hilbert space.
Our current work i) indicates that physically motivated initial conditions lie
in this dense set, ii) provides a Lorentz-signature counter-part to the
Euclidean techniques used to prove such theorems, and iii) provides an explicit
example of the relevant renormalization techniques.

is spatially resolved into two CO(1-0) components (north-east and south-west;
previously identified in CO 3-2 emission) with gas masses of 4.3 and 3.5 x
10^10 (alpha_CO/0.8) Msun. We thus find that the optically invisible north-east
component slightly dominates the gas mass in this system. The total molecular
gas mass derived from the CO(1-0) observations is ~2.5 times larger than
estimated from CO(3-2). The two components are at approximately the same
redshift, but separated by ~20 kpc in projection. The morphology is consistent
with that of an early-stage merger. The total amount of molecular gas is
sufficient to maintain the intense 500 Msun/yr starburst in this system for at
least ~160 Myr. We derive line brightness temperature ratios of
r_31=0.39+/-0.09 and 0.37+/-0.10, and r_51=0.26+/-0.07 and 0.25+/-0.08 in the
two components, respectively, suggesting that the J>=3 lines are substantially
subthermally excited. This also suggests comparable conditions for star
formation in both components. Given the similar gas masses of both components,
this is consistent with the comparable starburst strengths observed in the
radio continuum emission. Our findings are consistent with other recent studies
that find evidence for lower CO excitation in SMGs than in high-z quasar host
galaxies with comparable gas masses. This may provide supporting evidence that
both populations correspond to different evolutionary stages in the formation

effect of the shaking is to renormalize the nearest-neighbor hopping

for higher-order hopping terms, which are renormalized differently by the

this activity will finally cease. Here we present new observations with the ESO
2.2m telescope at La Silla to check the activity of Hale--Bopp at 30.7 AU solar
distance. On 2010-12-04, 26 CCD images were taken with 180 s exposure times for
photometry and morphology. The comet was detected in R and had a total
brightness of 23.3+-0.2 mag, referring to an absolute brightness of
R(1,1,0)=8.3. The profile of the coma was star-like at a seeing of 1.9"",
without any evidence of a coma or tail extending farther than 2.5"" (=55,000 km
in projection) and exceeding 26.5 mag/arcs^2 surface brightness. The measured
total brightness corresponds to a relative total reflecting surface, a_RC, of
485 km^2, nine times less than three years before. The calculated a_RC value
would imply a nucleus with 60--65 km radius assuming 4% albedo. This size
estimate is in significant contradiction with the previous results scattering
around 35 km. Therefore we suggest that the comet may still be in a low-level
activity, despite the lack of a prominent coma. Alternatively, if the nucleus
is already dormant, the albedo should be as high as 13%, assuming a radius of
35 km. With this observation, Hale--Bopp has been the most distant comet ever

predator-prey models. Two of the parameters in the models are crucial for the
paradox. These two parameters are the prey's carrying capacity and prey's
half-saturation for predation. Intuitively, increasing the carrying capacity
due to enrichment of the prey's environment should lead to a more stable
predator-prey system. Analytically, it turns out that increasing the carrying
capacity always leads to an unstable predator-prey system that is susceptible
to extinction from environmental random perturbations. This is the so-called
paradox of enrichment. Our resolution here rests upon a closer investigation on
a dimensionless number $H$ formed from the carrying capacity and the prey's
half-saturation. By recasting the models into dimensionless forms, the models
are in fact governed by a few dimensionless numbers including $H$. The effects
of the two parameters: carrying capacity and half-saturation are incorporated
into the number $H$. In fact, increasing the carrying capacity is equivalent
(i.e. has the same effect on $H$) to decreasing the half-saturation which
implies more aggressive predation. Since there is no paradox between more
aggressive predation and instability of the predator-prey system, the paradox
of enrichment is resolved.
  We also further explore spatially dependent models for which the phase space
is infinite dimensional. The spatially independent limit cycle which is
generated by a Hopf bifurcation from an unstable steady state, is linearly
stable in the infinite dimensional phase space. Numerical simulations indicate
that the basin of attraction of the limit cycle is riddled. This shows that
spatial perturbations can sometimes (neither always nor never) remove the
paradox of enrichment near the limit cycle!

molecules, the chemical network is supplied with an extended set of surface
reactions and photo-processes in ice mantles. Our disk model covers a wide
range of radii, 10-800 AU (from a Jovian planet-forming zone to the outer disk
edge). Turbulent transport of gases and ices is implicitly modeled in full 2D
along with the time-dependent chemistry. Two regimes are considered, with high
and low efficiency of turbulent mixing. The results of the chemical model with
suppressed turbulent diffusion are close to those from the laminar model, but
not completely. A simple analysis for the laminar chemical model to highlight
potential sensitivity of a molecule to transport processes is performed. It is
shown that the higher the ratio of the characteristic chemical timescale to the
turbulent transport timescale for a given molecule, the higher the probability
that its column density will be affected by diffusion. We find that turbulent
transport enhances abundances and column densities of many gas-phase species
and ices, particularly, complex ones. For such species a chemical steady-state
is not reached due to long timescales associated with evaporation and surface
photoprocessing and recombination. In contrast, simple radicals and molecular
ions, which chemical evolution is fast and proceeds solely in the gas phase,
are not much affected by dynamics. All molecules are divided into three groups

the jet from the inner edge of the accretion disk. It is magnetically
accelerated along field lines extending up from the disk and simultaneously
collimated by the magnetic pinch force. In the reference run which we use for
analysis, the matter in the jet crosses the Alfv\'en surface a few R_* above
the disk and the fast magnetosonic surface ~13 R_* above the disk. At larger
distances, the magnetic pressure is a few times smaller than the total matter
pressure but the magnetic force continues to accelerate and collimate the jet.
In steady state, we observe a matter ejection-to-accretion ratio of ~0.2.

is the array independent physical channel that can be individually modeled in
an analytical manner. Based on the framework, we firstly extend the

uniform linear arrays (ULAs) so far, to a general version applicable to
arbitrary array configurations. Then, we present two array independent
stochastic MIMO channel models based on the proposed new VCR as well as the

characteristics on channel capacity is separately investigated by studying the

countries with edge weights reflecting the value of imports and/or exports
between countries. In this paper we introduce to this macroeconomic system the
notion of extinction analysis, a technique often used in the analysis of
ecosystems, for the purposes of investigating the robustness of this network.
In particular, we subject the WTW to a principled set of in silico ""knockout
experiments,"" akin to those carried out in the investigation of food webs, but
suitably adapted to this macroeconomic network. Broadly, our experiments show
that over time the WTW moves to a ""robust yet fragile"" configuration where it
is robust to random failures but fragile under targeted attack. This change in
stability is highly correlated with the connectance (edge density) of the
network. Moreover, there is evidence of a sharp change in the structure of the
network in the 1960s and 1970s, where most measures of robustness rapidly
increase before resuming a declining trend. We interpret these results in the
context in the post-World War II move towards globalization. Globalization
coincides with the sharp increase in robustness but also with a rise in those
measures (e.g., connectance and trade imbalances) which correlate with
decreases in robustness. The peak of robustness is reached after the onset of
globalization policy but before the negative impacts are substantial. These
analyses depend on a simple model of dynamics that rebalances the trade flow
upon network perturbation, the most dramatic of which is node deletion. More
subtle and textured forms of perturbation lead to the definition of other
measures of node importance as well as vulnerability. We anticipate that
experiments and measures like these can play an important role in the
evaluation of the stability of economic systems.

laws with a negative exponent 1 such as the rank-size rule. The rank-size rule
is a very simple scaling law followed by many observations of the ubiquitous
empirical patterns in physical and social systems. Where there is a rank-size
distribution, there will be a hierarchy with cascade structure. However, the
equivalence relation between the rank-size rule and the hierarchical scaling
law remains to be mathematically demonstrated and empirically testified. In
this paper, theoretical derivation, mathematical experiments, and empirical
analysis are employed to show that the rank-size rule is equivalent in theory
to the hierarchical scaling law (the Nn principle). Abstracting an ordered set
of quantities in the form {1, 1/2,..., 1/k,...} from the rank-size rule, I
prove a geometric subdivision theorem of the harmonic sequence (k=1, 2, 3,...).
By the theorem, the rank-size distribution can be transformed into a
self-similar hierarchy, thus a power law can be decomposed as a pair of
exponential laws, and further the rank-size power law can be reconstructed as a
hierarchical scaling law. A number of ubiquitous empirical observations and
rules, including Zipf's law, Pareto's distribution, fractals, allometric
scaling, 1/f noise, can be unified into the hierarchical framework. The
self-similar hierarchy can provide us with a new perspective of looking at the
inverse power law of nature or even how nature works.

connected by links induced by foreign key and other relationships. The size of
the database graph that BANKS uses is proportional to the sum of the number of

presence of a sensing or observation matrix produces a linear mixing of the
simple Markovian dependency structure. This leads to reconstruction problems
that are non-convex optimizations. Past work has dealt with this issue by
resorting to greedy or suboptimal iterative reconstruction methods. In this
paper, we propose new modeling approaches based on group-sparsity penalties
that leads to convex optimizations that can be solved exactly and efficiently.
We show that the methods we develop perform significantly better in
deconvolution and compressed sensing applications, while being as
computationally efficient as standard coefficient-wise approaches such as
lasso.

changes to relative cohomology, which we use to give a general formulation of

first overtone radial modes, a nonradial \ell = 2 quintuplet, stellar rotation
and combinations of all of these. Two low-frequency peaks are found: f=0.160
c/d and a 2f peak. We show from a variety of arguments that the low-frequency
peak, f, (rather than the 2f peak) is the rotational frequency. The
corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrum from which
v sin i = 19 \pm 1 km/s is obtained. During rotation, the brightness changes by
0.5 ppt (parts-per-thousand, peak-to-peak). The rotation also modulates the
amplitudes of the two radial modes, leading to a small (but definite) variation
in amplitude of 0.5% of their average values. Both the rotational brightness
variations and the pulsation amplitudes form a double wave during rotation. The
variations are in phase. The maximum pulsation amplitude occurs at the
rotational phase with minimum brightness. Consequently, the 'normal' star KIC
9700322 behaves such as an extremely weak chemically peculiar star. Since such
variations are also seen in some other A stars studied by Kepler, normal stars
with a symmetric surface may not exist. The significance of this star is that
even a simple, slowly rotating, radial pulsator already shows rotational
brightness variations and modulation of the pulsation amplitude.

effective temperatures are derived from 2MASS colours. The observational
results are compared with BaSTI evolution models. Results: We find that the
mass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities delta_nu vs.
nu_max relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under the
assumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation / damping of the
oscillations. The positions of the stars in the H-R diagram depend on both mass

metallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the H-R

solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819. For the young cluster NGC 6811, the
explanation of the position of the stars in the H-R diagram challenges the

lower metallicity [Fe/H] in the range -0.3 to -0.7 dex. Also, nearly all the

resistance. Superconductivity and magnetism are known to be antagonistic
phenomena: superconductors expel weak external magnetic field (the Meissner
effect) while a sufficiently strong magnetic field, in general, destroys
superconductivity. In a seemingly contradictory statement, we show that a very
strong magnetic field can turn an empty space into a superconductor. The
external magnetic field required for this effect should be about 10^{16} Tesla
(eB ~ 1 GeV^2). The physical mechanism of the exotic vacuum superconductivity
is as follows: in strong magnetic field the dynamics of virtual quarks and
antiquarks is effectively one-dimensional because these electrically charged
particles tend to move along the lines of the magnetic field. In one spatial
dimension a gluon-mediated attraction between a quark and an antiquark of
different flavors inevitably leads to formation of a colorless spin-triplet
bound state (a vector analogue of the Cooper pair) with quantum numbers of an
electrically charged rho meson. Such quark-antiquark pairs condense to form an
anisotropic inhomogeneous superconducting state similar to the Abrikosov vortex
lattice in a type-II superconductor. The onset of the superconductivity of the
charged rho mesons should also induce an inhomogeneous superfluidity of the
neutral rho mesons. The vacuum superconductivity should survive at very high
temperatures of typical Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) scale of 10^{12} K (T ~
100 MeV). We propose the phase diagram of QCD in the plane ""magnetic field -

evolve into a diagonal state as a result of the natural evolution of the total
composite system. We explore the conditions under which the pointer states of
the system become independent of time; so that a preferred basis of measurement
can be realized. As we show, these conditions include the so-called quantum
limit of decoherence and the so-called quantum measurement limit; as well as
some other specific conditions which are discussed in the paper. We relate the
mathematical conditions for having time-independent pointer states to some
classes of possible symmetries in the Hamiltonian of the total composite
system. Indeed, our theory would serve as a generalization of the existing
theory for determination of the preferred basis of measurement. By exploiting
this new theory we can obtain those regimes of the parameter space for a given
total Hamiltonian defining our system-environment model for which a preferred
basis of measurement can be realized. Moreover, we can predict the
corresponding preferred basis of measurement for each regime. We can also
obtain the time-dependent pointer states of the system and the environment in
most of the other regimes where the pointer states of the system are
time-dependent and a preferred basis of measurement cannot be realized at all.
This ability to obtain time-dependent pointer states is specifically important
in decoherence studies; as pointer states correspond to those initial
conditions for the state of the system and the environment for which we can
have longer decoherence times.

Since that time, the mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces has been a lively
area of study. Although Huisken's seminal paper is now just over twenty-five
years old, the study of the mean curvature flow of submanifolds of higher
codimension has only recently started to receive attention. The mean curvature
flow of submanifolds is the main object of investigation in this thesis, and
indeed, the central results we obtain can be considered as high codimension
analogues of some early hypersurface theorems. The result of Huisken's 1984
paper roughly says that convex hypersurfaces evolve under the mean curvature
flow to round points in finite time. Here we obtain the result that if the
ratio of the length of the second fundamental form to the length of the mean
curvature vector is bounded (by some explicit constant depending on dimension
but not codimension), then the submanifold will evolve under the mean curvature
flow to a round point in finite time. We investigate evolutions in flat and
curved backgrounds, and explore the singular behaviour of the flows as the
first singular time is approached.

involves challenging combinatorial optimization problems. Typically, a network
designer has to select among several alternatives which links to establish so
that the resulting network satisfies a given set of connectivity requirements
and the cost of establishing the network links is as low as possible. The
Minimum Spanning Tree problem, which is well-understood, is a nice example.
  In this paper, we consider the natural scenario in which the connectivity
requirements are posed by selfish users who have agreed to share the cost of
the network to be established according to a well-defined rule. The design
proposed by the network designer should now be consistent not only with the
connectivity requirements but also with the selfishness of the users.
Essentially, the users are players in a so-called network design game and the
network designer has to propose a design that is an equilibrium for this game.
As it is usually the case when selfishness comes into play, such equilibria may
be suboptimal. In this paper, we consider the following question: can the
network designer enforce particular designs as equilibria or guarantee that
efficient designs are consistent with users' selfishness by appropriately
subsidizing some of the network links? In an attempt to understand this
question, we formulate corresponding optimization problems and present positive
and negative results.

lexical differences seems to have its roots in the work of the French explorer
Dumont D'Urville. He collected comparative words lists of various languages
during his voyages aboard the Astrolabe from 1826 to 1829 and, in his work
about the geographical division of the Pacific, he proposed a method to measure
the degree of relation between languages.
  The method used by the modern lexicostatistics, developed by Morris Swadesh
in the 1950s, measures distances from the percentage of shared cognates, which
are words with a common historical origin. The weak point of this method is
that subjective judgment plays a relevant role.
  Recently, we have proposed a new automated method which is motivated by the
analogy with genetics. The new approach avoids any subjectivity and results can
be easily replicated by other scholars. The distance between two languages is
defined by considering a renormalized Levenshtein distance between pair of
words with the same meaning and averaging on the words contained in a list. The
renormalization, which takes into account the length of the words, plays a
crucial role, and no sensible results can be found without it.
  In this paper we give a short review of our automated method and we
illustrate it by considering the cluster of Malagasy dialects. We show that it
sheds new light on their kinship relation and also that it furnishes a lot of
new information concerning the modalities of the settlement of Madagascar.

primitive words over some alphabet $\zi $ has received special interest. With
this survey article we give an overview about relevant research to this topic
during the last twenty years including own investigations and some new results.
In Section 1 after recalling the most important notions from formal language
theory we illustrate the connection between coding theory and primitive words
by some facts. We define primitive words as words having only a trivial
representation as the power of another word. Nonprimitive words (without the
empty word) are exactly the periodic words. Every nonempty word is a power of
an uniquely determined primitive word which is called the root of the former
one. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of
the language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties
which we consider in Section 2. In Section 3 we investigate the relationship
between the set $Q$ of all primitive words over some fixed alphabet and the
language classes of the Chomsky Hierarchy and the contextual languages over the
same alphabet. The computational complexity of the set $Q$ and of the roots of
languages are considered in Section 4. The set of all powers of the same degree
of all words from a language is the power of this language. We examine the
powers of languages for different sets of exponents, and especially their
regularity and context-freeness, in Section 5, and the decidability of
appropriate questions in Section 6. Section 7 is dedicated to several
generalizations of the notions of periodicity and primitivity of words.

planetary companion with long-period and low-amplitude radial velocity (RV)
variations in oscillating K2 III star {\alpha} Ari (HD 12929). We do not find
the correlation between RV variations and chromospheric activity indicators (Ca
II H & K region, H{\alpha} line). The bisector analysis also shows that the
bisector velocity span (BVS) does not show any obvious correlation with RV
variation but has periodic component that may be attributed to the rotation of
the star. If the RV variation is indeed caused by a planetary companion, an
orbital solution with a period of P = 381 days, a semi-amplitude of K = 41 m/s,
and an eccentricity of e = 0.25 fits the data best. Assuming a possible stellar
mass of M_star = 1.5 M_sun, we estimate the minimum mass for the planetary

spectrum of several candidate molecules. It is shown that the thiourea
functional group, associated with various carbonaceous structures (mainly
compact and linear aromatic clusters), is able to mimic the 21-$\mu$m band
emitted by a number of proto-planetary nebulae. The combination of nitrogen and
sulphur in thiourea is the essential source of emission in this model: the band
disappears if these species are replaced by carbon.
  The astronomical 21-$\mu$m feature extends redward to merge with another
prominent band peaking between 25 and 30 $\mu$m, also known as the 30-$\mu$m
band. It is found that the latter can be modelled by the combined spectra of
aliphatic chains, made of CH$_{2}$ groups, oxygen bridges and OH groups, which
provide the 30-$\mu$m emission. The absence of oxygen all but extinguishes the
30-$\mu$m emission. The emission between the 21- and 30-$\mu$m bands is
provided mainly by thiourea attached to linear aromatic clusters.
  The chemical software reveals that the essential role of the heteroatoms N, S
and O stems from their large electronic charge. It also allows to determine the
type of atomic vibration responsible for the different lines of each structure,
which helps selecting the most relevant structures.
  A total of 22 structures have been selected here, but their list is far from
being exhaustive; they are only intended as examples of 3 generic classes. When
background dust emission is added, model spectra are obtained, which are able
to satisfactorily reproduce recent observations of proto-planetary nebulae.

phenomenon which takes place during start-up shear flows in a simple yield
stress fluid, namely a carbopol microgel. A combination of classical
rheological measurements and ultrasonic velocimetry makes it possible to get
physical insights on the transient dynamics of both the stress $\sigma(t)$ and
the velocity field across the gap of a rough cylindrical Couette cell during
the start-up of shear under an applied shear rate $\dot\gamma$. (i) At small
strains ($\gamma <1$), $\sigma(t)$ increases linearly and the microgel
undergoes homogeneous deformation. (ii) At a time $t_m$, the stress reaches a
maximum value $\sigma_m$ which corresponds to the failure of the microgel and
to the nucleation of a thin lubrication layer at the moving wall. (iii) The
microgel then experiences a strong elastic recoil and enters a regime of total
wall slip while the stress slowly decreases. (iv) Total wall slip gives way to
a transient shear-banding phenomenon, which occurs on timescales much longer
than that of the stress overshoot and has been described elsewhere [Divoux
\textit{et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.}, 2010, \textbf{104}, 208301]. This whole
sequence is very robust to concentration changes in the explored range ($0.5
\le C \le 3%$ w/w). We further demonstrate that the maximum stress $\sigma_m$
and the corresponding strain $\gamma_m=\dot\gamma t_m$ both depend on the
applied shear rate $\dot \gamma$ and on the waiting time $t_w$ between preshear
and shear start-up: they remain roughly constant as long as $\dot\gamma$ is
smaller than some critical shear rate $\dot\gamma_w\sim 1/t_w$ and they
increase as weak power laws of $\dot \gamma$ for $\dot\gamma> \dot\gamma_w$

for spherically-symmetric systems; this approach was first discussed by Lasenby
et al. in the language of geometric algebra. The method is used to derive
metrics describing a point mass in a spatially-flat, open and closed expanding
universe respectively. In the spatially-flat case, a simple coordinate
transformation relates the metric to the corresponding one derived by McVittie.
Nonetheless, our use of non-comoving (`physical') coordinates greatly
facilitates physical interpretation. For the open and closed universes, our
metrics describe different spacetimes to the corresponding McVittie metrics and
we believe the latter to be incorrect. In the closed case, our metric possesses
an image mass at the antipodal point of the universe. We calculate the geodesic
equations for the spatially-flat metric and interpret them. For radial motion
in the Newtonian limit, the force acting on a test particle consists of the
usual $1/r^2$ inwards component due to the central mass and a cosmological
component proportional to $r$ that is directed outwards (inwards) when the
expansion of the universe is accelerating (decelerating). For the standard
$\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, the cosmological force reverses direction
at about $z\approx 0.67$. We also derive an invariant fully
general-relativistic expression, valid for arbitrary spherically-symmetric
systems, for the force required to hold a test particle at rest relative to the
central point mass.

Ramsey-like cardinals are defined by generalizing the characterization of
Ramsey cardinals via the existence of elementary embeddings. Ultrafilters
derived from such embeddings are fully iterable and so it is natural to ask
about large cardinal notions asserting the existence of ultrafilters allowing
only $\alpha$-many iterations for some countable ordinal $\alpha$. Here we
study such $\alpha$-iterable cardinals. We show that the $\alpha$-iterable
cardinals form a strict hierarchy for $\alpha\leq\omega_1$, that they are
downward absolute to $L$ for $\alpha<\omega_1^L$, and that the consistency
strength of Schindler's remarkable cardinals is strictly between 1-iterable and

an expanding universe derived in Nandra, Lasenby & Hobson, and of the
associated invariant expression for the force required to keep a test particle
at rest relative to the central mass. We focus on the effect of an expanding
universe on massive objects on the scale of galaxies and clusters. Using
Newtonian and general-relativistic approaches, we identify two important
time-dependent physical radii for such objects when the cosmological expansion
is accelerating. The first radius, $r_F$, is that at which the total radial
force on a test particle is zero, which is also the radius of the largest
possible circular orbit about the central mass $m$ and where the gas pressure
and its gradient vanish. The second radius, $r_S$, which is \approx r_F/1.6$,
is that of the largest possible stable circular orbit, which we interpret as
the theoretical maximum size for an object of mass $m$. In contrast, for a
decelerating cosmological expansion, no such finite radii exist. Assuming a
cosmological expansion consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM concordance model, at the
present epoch we find that these radii put a sensible constraint on the typical
sizes of both galaxies and clusters at low redshift. For galaxies, we also find
that these radii agree closely with zeroes in the radial velocity field in the
neighbourhood of nearby galaxies, as inferred by Peirani & Pacheco from recent
observations of stellar velocities. We then consider the future effect on
massive objects of an accelerating cosmological expansion driven by phantom
energy, for which the universe is predicted to end in a `Big Rip' at a finite
time in the future at which the scale factor becomes singular. In particular,
we present a novel calculation of the time prior to the Big Rip that an object
of a given mass and size will become gravitationally unbound.

statistically hyperbolic, then give some results for products, for

metrics asymptotically approach norms induced by convex polytopes, causing the
study of sprawl to reduce to a problem in convex geometry. We present an

of flavor violation in the soft supersymmetry breaking sector. We focus on
flavor violation in the sleptonic sector and study the implications for the
co-annihilation regions. Flavor violation is introduced by a single
$\tilde{\mu}_R-\tilde{\tau}_R$ insertion in the slepton mass matrix. Limits on
this insertion from BR($\tau \to \mu + \gamma$) are weak in some regions of the
parameter space where cancellations happen within the amplitudes. We look for
overlaps in parameter space where both the co-annihilation condition as well as
the cancellations within the amplitudes occur. In mSUGRA, such overlap regions
are not existent, whereas they are present in models with non-universal Higgs
boundary conditions (NUHM). The effect of flavor violation is two fold: (a) it
shifts the co-annihilation regions towards lighter neutralino masses (b) the
co-annihilation cross sections would be modified with the inclusion of flavor
violating diagrams which can contribute significantly. Even if flavor violation
is within the presently allowed limits, this is sufficient to modify the
thermally averaged cross-sections by about (10-15)% in mSUGRA and (20-30)% in
NUHM, depending on the parameter space. In the overlap regions, the flavor
violating cross sections become comparable and in some cases even dominant to
the flavor conserving ones. A comparative study of the channels is presented
for mSUGRA and NUHM cases.

TiC alloyed on the Ti sublattice with 3d transition metals ranging from Sc to
Zn. The theory is accompanied with experimental investigations, both as regards
materials synthesis as well as characterization. Our results show that by
dissolving a metal with a weak ability to form carbides, the stability of the
alloy is lowered and a driving force for the release of carbon from the carbide
is created. During thin film growth of a metal carbide this effect will favor
the formation of a nanocomposite with carbide grains in a carbon matrix. The
choice of alloying elements as well as their concentrations will affect the
relative amount of carbon in the carbide and in the carbon matrix. This can be
used to design the structure of nanocomposites and their physical and chemical
properties. One example of applications is as low-friction coatings. Of the
materials studied, we suggest the late 3d transition metals as the most
promising elements for this phenomenon, at least when alloying with TiC.

With this interpretation, the ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal index can be realized
as the partition function on a Scherk-Schwarz deformed background. We apply the
localization method in TQFT to compute the deformed partition function since
the deformed action can be written as a $\delta_\epsilon$-exact form. The
critical points of the deformed action turn out to be the space of flat
connections which are, in fact, zero modes of the gauge field. The one-loop
evaluation over the space of flat connections reduces to the matrix integral by
which the ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal index is expressed.

given set of rooted input trees can be formalized in different ways, to cope
with contradictory information in the input. We consider the Minimum Flip
Supertree problem, where the input trees are transformed into a 0/1/?-matrix,
such that each row represents a taxon, and each column represents an inner node
of one of the input trees. Our goal is to find a perfect phylogeny for the
input matrix requiring a minimum number of 0/1-flips, that is, corrections of
0/1-entries in the matrix. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Here, we
present a parameterized data reduction with polynomial running time. The data
reduction guarantees that the reduced instance has a solution if and only if
the original instance has a solution. We then make our data reduction
parameter-independent by using upper bounds. This allows us to preprocess an
instance, and to solve the reduced instance with an arbitrary method. Different
from an existing data reduction for the consensus tree problem, our reduction
allows us to draw conclusions about certain entries in the matrix. We have
implemented and evaluated our data reduction. Unfortunately, we find that the
Minimum Flip Supertree problem is also hard in practice: The amount of
information that can be derived during data reduction diminishes as instances
get more ""complicated"", and running times for ""complicated"" instances quickly
become prohibitive. Still, our method offers another route of attack for this
relevant phylogenetic problem.

single linear multiblock copolymer chain under poor solvent conditions varying
the block length $N$, the number of blocks $n$, and the solvent quality by
variation of the temperature $T$. We study the most symmetrical case, where the
number of blocks of monomers of type A, $n_{A}$, equals that of monomers B,
$n_{B}$ ($n_{A}=n_{B}=n/2$), the length of all blocks is the same irrespective
of their type, and potential parameters are also chosen symmetrically, as for a
standard Lennard-Jones fluid. Under poor solvent conditions the chains collapse
and blocks with monomers of the same type form clusters, which are phase
separated from the clusters with monomers of the other type. We study the
dependence of the size of the formed clusters on $n$, $N$ and $T$. Furthermore,
we discuss our results with respect to recent simulation data on the phase
behaviour of such macromolecules, providing a complete picture for the cluster
formations in single multiblock copolymer chains under poor solvent conditions.
