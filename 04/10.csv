article we analyze the adjoint equations that arise in the context of
compressible flows governed by the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. We show
that the continuous adjoints and the discrete adjoints computed by automatic
differentiation agree numerically; in particular the adjoint is found to be

elastic properties of composites consisting of randomly distributed stiff
fibers embedded in an elastic matrix in two and three dimensions. Recent
experiments published in Physical Review Letters [102, 188303 (2009)] have
suggested that the inclusion of stiff microtubules in a softer, nearly
incompressible biopolymer matrix can lead to emergent compressibility. This can
be understood in terms of the enhancement of the compressibility of the
composite relative to its shear compliance as a result of the addition of stiff
rod-like inclusions. We show that the Poisson's ratio $\nu$ of such a composite
evolves with increasing rod density towards a particular value, or {\em fixed
point}, independent of the material properties of the matrix, so long as it has
a finite initial compressibility. This fixed point is $\nu=1/4$ in three
dimensions and $\nu=1/3$ in two dimensions. Our results suggest an important
role for stiff filaments such as microtubules and stress fibers in cell
mechanics. At the same time, our work has a wider elasticity context, with
potential applications to composite elastic media with a wide separation of
scales in stiffness of its constituents such as carbon nanotube-polymer
composites, which have been shown to have highly tunable mechanics.

supersymmetric (SUSY) models can generate the $\mu \to e \gamma$ decay rate

in comparison with the known results of spin-boson-bath model, the

supersymmetric model), assuming all the relevant soft mass parameters to be
below TeV scale. We find that in the parameter space allowed by current
experiments the neutralino dark matter can be as light as a few GeV and its
scattering rate off the nucleon can reach the sensitivity of XENON100 and
CoGeNT. As a result, a sizable parameter space is excluded by the current
XENON100 and CoGeNT data (the plausible CoGeNT dark matter signal can also be
explained). The future 6000 kg-days exposure of XENON100 will further explore
(but cannot completely cover) the remained parameter space. Moreover, we find
that in such a light dark matter scenario a light CP-even or CP-odd Higgs boson
must be present to satisfy the measured dark matter relic density.
Consequently, the SM-like Higgs boson $h_{SM}$ may decay predominantly into a
pair of light Higgs bosons or a pair of neutralinos so that the conventional

from the electroweak data, if we leave out the jet asymmetry data that do not

that enjoys many desirable properties. However, it requires a trusted mediator,
which is a major drawback in many practical applications. A computational
solution to this problem was proposed by Dodis, Halevi and Rabin. They extended
the original game by adding an initial communication stage and showed that any
correlated strategy for 2-player games can be achieved, provided that the
players are computationally bounded.
  In this paper, we show that if the players can communicate via a quantum
channel before the game, then any correlated equilibrium for 2-player games can
be achieved, without a trusted mediator and unconditionally. This provides
another example of a major advantage of quantum information processing. More
precisely, we prove that for any correlated equilibrium p of a strategic game
G, there exists an extended game (with a quantum communication initial stage) Q
with an efficiently computable approximate Nash equilibrium q, such that the
expected payoff for both players in q is at least as high as in p. The main
cryptographic tool used in the construction is the quantum weak coin flipping
protocol of Mochon.

Geometrical properties of the landscape, e.g. the local density of states
describing the distribution in energy of the states belonging to a single
valley, are key to understand the dynamical properties of such systems. In this
paper we combine the lid algorithm, a tool for landscape exploration previously
applied to a range of models, with the Wang-Swendsen algorithm. To test this
improved exploration tool, we consider a paradigmatic complex system, the
Edwards-Andersom model in two and three spatial dimension. We find a striking
difference between the energy dependence of the local density of states in the
two cases: nearly flat in the first case, and nearly exponential in the second.
The lid dependence of the data is analyzed to estimate the form of the global
density of states.
