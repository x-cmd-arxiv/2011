system formed on the liquid helium surface in the presence of resonant
microwave irradiation is described, and a new mechanism of the negative linear
response conductivity is studied using the self-consistent Born approximation.
Two kinds of scatterers (vapor atoms and capillary wave quanta) are considered.
Besides a conductivity modulation expected near the points, where the
excitation frequency for inter-subband transitions is commensurate with the
cyclotron frequency, a sign-changing correction to the linear conductivity is
shown to appear for usual quasi-elastic inter-subband scattering, if the
collision broadening of Landau levels is much smaller than thermal energy. The
decay heating of the electron system near the commensurability points leads to
magnetooscillations of electron temperature, which are shown to increase the
importance of the sign-changing correction. The line shape of
magnetoconductivity oscillations calculated for wide ranges of temperature and
magnetic field is in a good accordance with experimental observations.

backbone carbons and proximal waters of hydration in mechanically strained
elastin by nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The experimental data indicate a
decrease in the correlation times of the carbonyl carbons as the strain on the
biopolymer is increased. These observations are in good agreement with short
4ns molecular dynamics simulations of (VPGVG)3, a well studied mimetic peptide
of elastin. The experimental results also indicate a reduction in the
correlation time of proximal waters of hydration with increasing strain applied
to the elastomer. A simple model is suggested that correlates the increase in
the motion of proximal waters of hydration to the increase in frequency of
libration of the protein backbone that develops with increasing strain.
Together, the reduction in the protein entropy accompanied with the increase in
entropy of the proximal waters of hydration with increasing strain, support the
notion that the source of elasticity is driven by an entropic mechanism arising
from the change in entropy of the protein backbone.

particles in a magnetized classical plasma due to the electric field
fluctuations are reported. The energy loss for a test particle is calculated
through the linear-response theory. At vanishing magnetic field the electric
field fluctuations lead to an energy gain of the charged particle for all
velocities. It has been shown that in the presence of strong magnetic field
this effect occurs only at low-velocities. In the opposite case of
high-velocities the test particle systematically loses its energy due to the
interaction with a stochastic electric field. The net effect of the
fluctuations is the systematic reduction of the total energy loss (i.e. the sum
of the polarization and stochastic energy losses) at vanishing magnetic field
and reduction or enhancement at strong field depending on the velocity of the
particle. It is found that the energy loss of the slow heavy ion contains an
anomalous term which depends logarithmically on the projectile mass. The
physical origin of this anomalous term is the coupling between the cyclotron
motion of the plasma electrons and the long-wavelength, low-frequency
fluctuations produced by the projectile ion. This effect may strongly enhance
the stochastic energy gain of the particle.

able to give guarantees on degree and stretch, while at the same time
preserving the expansion and spectral properties of the network. These repairs
preserve the invariants in the following sense. At any point in the algorithm,
the expansion of the graph will be either `better' than the expansion of the
graph formed by considering only the adversarial insertions (not the
adversarial deletions) or the expansion will be, at least, a constant. Also,
the stretch i.e. the distance between any pair of nodes in the healed graph is
no more than a $O(\log n)$ factor. Similarly, at any point, a node $v$ whose
degree would have been $d$ in the graph with adversarial insertions only, will
have degree at most $O(\kappa d)$ in the actual graph, for a small parameter
$\kappa$. We also provide bounds on the second smallest eigenvalue of the
Laplacian which captures key properties such as mixing time, conductance,
congestion in routing etc. Our distributed data structure has low amortized

measurements from the SORCE satellite, both for total solar irradiance and
broken down into spectral regions on timescales of several years. Methods: We
use the SATIRE model and compare modeled total solar irradiance (TSI) with TSI
measurements between 2003 and 2009. Spectral solar irradiance over 200-1630nm
is compared with the SIM instrument on SORCE between 2004 and 2009 during a
period of decline from moderate activity to the recent solar minimum in 10 nm
bands and for three spectral regions of significant interest: the UV integrated
over 200-300nm, the visible over 400-691nm and the IR between 972-1630 nm.
Results: The model captures 97% of observed TSI variation. In the spectral
comparison, rotational variability is well reproduced, especially between 400
and 1200 nm. The magnitude of change in the long-term trends is many times
larger in SIM at almost all wavelengths while trends in SIM oppose SATIRE in
the visible between 500 and 700nm and between 1000 and 1200nm. We discuss the
remaining issues with both SIM data and the identified limits of the model,
particularly with the way facular contributions are dealt with, the limit of
flux identification in MDI magnetograms during solar minimum and the model
atmospheres in the IR employed by SATIRE. It is unlikely that improvements in
these areas will significantly enhance the agreement in the long-term trends.
This disagreement implies that some mechanism other than surface magnetism is
causing SSI variations, in particular between 2004 and 2006, if the SIM data
are correct. Since SATIRE was able to reproduce UV irradiance between 1991 and
2002 from UARS, either the solar mechanism for SSI variation fundamentally
changed around the peak of cycle 23, or there is an inconsistency between UARS
and SORCE UV measurements. We favour the second explanation.

molecular data has provided unprecedented insights into biological pathways and
signalling mechanisms. Graphical models and networks have especially proven to
be useful abstractions in this regard. Ad-hoc thresholds are often used in
conjunction with structure learning algorithms to determine significant
associations. The present study overcomes this limitation by proposing a
statistically-motivated approach for identifying significant associations in a
network.
  Methods and Materials: A new method that identifies significant associations
in graphical models by estimating the threshold minimising the $L_{\mathrm{1}}$
norm between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the observed edge
confidences and those of its asymptotic counterpart is proposed. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on popular synthetic data
sets as well as publicly available experimental molecular data corresponding to
gene and protein expression profiles.
  Results: The improved performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated
across the synthetic data sets using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as
performance metrics. The results are also demonstrated across varying sample
sizes and three different structure learning algorithms with widely varying
assumptions. In all cases, the proposed approach has specificity and accuracy
close to 1, while sensitivity increases linearly in the logarithm of the sample
size. The estimated threshold systematically outperforms common ad-hoc ones in
terms of sensitivity while maintaining comparable levels of specificity and
accuracy. Networks from experimental data sets are reconstructed accurately
with respect to the results from the original papers.

the closest and strongest dwarf starburst galaxies in the local universe, to
characterize their stellar density and populations, and obtain new insights
into the structure, formation, and evolution of starburst galaxies and galaxy
halos. Methods. We obtained HST/WFPC2 images between 5 and 8 scale radii from
the center, along the intermediate and minor axes. We performed point-source
photometry to determine color magnitude diagrams of I vs. V-I. We compared the
results at different radii, including also our prior HST/ACS results for more
centrally located fields. Results. We detect stars in the RGB and TP-AGB
(carbon star) phases in all outer fields, but not younger stars such as those
present at smaller radii. The RGB star density profile is well fit by either a
de Vaucouleurs profile or a power-law profile, but has more stars at large
radii than a single exponential. To within the uncertainties, there are no
radial gradients in the RGB color or carbon-to-RGB-star ratio at large radii.
Conclusions. The galaxies have faint outer stellar envelopes that are not
tidally truncated within the range of radii addressed by our study. The density
profiles suggest that these are not outward extensions of the inner disks, but
are instead distinct stellar halos. This agrees with other work on galaxies of
similar morphology. The presence of such halos is consistent with predictions
of hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios. The halos consist of
intermediate-age/old stars, confirming the results of other studies that have
shown the starburst phenomenon to be very centrally concentrated. There is no
evidence for stellar-population age/metallicity gradients within the halos
themselves.

dipole is that all of it is produced by local peculiar motions. Alternative
explanations requiring part of the dipole to be primordial have received
support from measurements of large-scale bulk flows. A test of the two
hypothesis is whether other cosmic dipoles produced by collapsed structures
later than last scattering coincide with the CMB dipole. One background is the
cosmic infrared background (CIB) whose absolute spectrum was measured to ~30%
by the COBE satellite. Over the 100 to 500 {\mu}m wavelength range its spectral
energy distribution can provide a probe of its alignment with CMB. This is
tested with the COBE FIRAS dataset which is available for such a measurement
because of its low noise and frequency resolution important for Galaxy
subtraction. Although the FIRAS instrument noise is in principle low enough to
determine the CIB dipole, the Galactic foreground is sufficiently close
spectrally to keep the CIB dipole hidden. A similar analysis is performed with
DIRBE, which - because of the limited frequency coverage - provides a poorer a
dataset. We discuss strategies for measuring the CIB dipole with future
instruments to probe the tilt and apply it to the Planck, Herschel and the
proposed Pixie missions. We demonstrate that a future FIRAS-like instrument
with instrument noise a factor of ~10 lower than FIRAS would make a
statistically significant measurement of the CIB dipole. We find that the
Planck and Herschel data sets will not allow a robust CIB dipole measurement.
The Pixie instrument promises a determination of the CIB dipole and its
alignment with either the CMB dipole or the dipole galaxy acceleration vector.

dimension reduction to the 1-dim space as a singular limiting case.
  Here the non-static models of space geometry with axial symmetry are under
consideration. To make these models closer to physical reality, we define a set
of ""admissible"" shape functions $\rho(t,z)$ as the $(2+1)$-dim Einstein
equations solutions in the vacuum space-time, in the presence of the
$\Lambda$-term, and for the space-time filled with the standard ""dust"". It is
curious that in the last case the Einstein equations reduce to the well-known
Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation, thus enabling one to obtain the general solution of
the Cauchy problem, as well as a set of other specific solutions involving one
arbitrary function. A few explicit solutions of the Klein-Fock-Gordon equation
in this set are given.
  An interesting qualitative feature of these solutions relates to the
dimension reduction points, their classification, and time behavior. In
particular, these new entities could provide us with novel insight into the

toward understanding planet formation. Of particular interest is the case of HD
100546, a Herbig Be star that presents a gap within the first 13 AU of its
protoplanetary disk, that may originate in the dynamical interactions of a
forming planet. We gathered a large amount of new interferometric data using
the AMBER/VLTI instrument in the H- and K-bands to spatially resolve the warm
inner disk and constrain its structure. Then, combining these measurements with
photometric observations, we analyze the circumstellar environment of HD 100546
in the light of a passive disk model based on 3D Monte-Carlo radiative
transfer. Finally, we use hydrodynamical simulations of gap formation by
planets to predict the radial surface density profile of the disk and test the
hypothesis of ongoing planet formation. The SED and the NIR interferometric
data are adequately reproduced by our model. We show that the H- and K-band
emissions are coming mostly from the inner edge of the internal dust disk,
located near 0.24 AU from the star, i.e., at the dust sublimation radius in our
model. We directly measure an inclination of $33^{\circ} \pm 11^{\circ}$ and a
position angle of $140^{\circ} \pm 16^{\circ}$ for the inner disk. This is
similar to the values found for the outer disk ($i \simeq 42^{\circ}$, $PA
\simeq 145^{\circ}$), suggesting that both disks may be coplanar. We finally
show that 1 to 8 Jupiter mass planets located at $\sim 8$ AU from the star
would have enough time to create the gap and the required surface density jump
of three orders of magnitude between the inner and outer disk. However, no
information on the amount of matter left in the gap is available, which
precludes us from setting precise limits on the planet mass, for now.

channels by relating them to the outage probability, under mild assumptions.
The analysis is based on the Tauberian theorem for Laplace-Stieltjes transforms
which is grounded on the notion of regular variation, and applies to a wider
range of channel distributions than existing approaches. The theory of regular
variation is argued to be the proper mathematical framework for finding
sufficient and necessary conditions for outage events to dominate high-SNR
error rate performance. It is proved that the diversity order being $d$ and the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the channel power gain having
variation exponent $d$ at 0 imply each other, provided that the instantaneous
error rate is upper-bounded by an exponential function of the instantaneous
SNR. High-SNR asymptotic average error rates are derived for specific
instantaneous error rates. Compared to existing approaches in the literature,
the asymptotic expressions are related to the channel distribution in a much
simpler manner herein, and related with outage more intuitively. The high-SNR
asymptotic error rate is also characterized under diversity combining schemes
with the channel power gain of each branch having a regularly varying CDF.
Numerical results are shown to corroborate our theoretical analysis.

illustrate the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, because
of/despite its simple appearance, there is much confusion surrounding its
essence. Theorists have been asking questions for years: Is there a mechanism
to explain this term? Is it really a constant or a variable? Moreover, it seems
that we have created a huge gulf separating the theories of inflation and
accelerating expansion. Can we eliminate such an uncomfortable discontinuity?
  Abstract In this paper, we will journey to see the growth of the universe
from the very beginning of inflation. To simplify our discussion, we will
briefly ""turn off"" the effects of real and dark matter and shall use inflaton
(a classical scalar field) dynamics with a time-varying inflaton potential
V(phi,t) as the screen to watch this process. Relying on these conditions, we
propose a non-traditional method of obtaining the solution of scale factor
R(t), which is only dependent on phi'(t)^2, and discover that the term
R""(t)/R(t) will be a constant after kinetic inflaton phi'(t) is at rest. This
result can be regarded as the effective cosmological constant phenomenally.
Moreover, we will also ""rebuild"" V(phi,t), realize its evolutionary process and
then, according to the relationship between V(phi,t) and phi'(t)^2, it will be
possible to smoothly describe the whole evolution of the universe from the
epoch of inflation. Therefore, the implications of our findings will mean that
the gulf between theories will disappear. Lastly, we will also see how the
formula could provide a framework for solving the old and new cosmological
constant problems as well as much more besides.

loss indicates the current binary separation has increased by a factor of 1.6
from its primordial state when the current primary was forming its planet(s),
implying a0 > 150 AU and constraining stable planets to within 15-20 AU for a
binary eccentricity of e=0.5. Almost 80 years have passed since the first
detection of the stellar companion, and marginal orbital motion may be apparent
in the binary, suggesting a near edge-on configuration with i > 70 deg, albeit
with substantial uncertainty. If correct, and all known bodies are coplanar,
the mass of the planet HD 27442b is bound between 1.66 and 1.77 Mjup. A search
for photospheric metals in the DA white dwarf yields no detections, and hence
there is no clear signature of an extant planetary system orbiting the
previously more massive secondary. However, if the white dwarf mass derived via
spectral fitting is correct, its evolution could have been influenced by
interactions with inner planets during the asymptotic giant branch. Based on
the frequency of giant planets and circumstellar debris as a function of
stellar mass, it is unlikely that the primordial primary would be void of
planets, given at least one orbiting its less massive sibling.

projection effects. This is a consequence of the central limit theorem, which
suppresses departures from Gaussianity when the projection reaches over several
correlation lengths of the density field, L_P~55 [Mpc/h]. Furthermore, the
typical scales that contribute to projected bispectra are generally smaller
than those that contribute to projected power spectra. Both of these effects
are not specific to lensing, and thus affect the statistics of non-linear
tracers (e.g., peaks) of any projected density field. Thus, the clustering of
biased tracers of the three-dimensional density field is generically more
sensitive to non-Gaussianity than observables constructed from projected

from z~6-10 show a steep decline in abundance with increasing redshift.
However, the LF is a convolution of the mass function of dark matter halos
(HMF)--which also declines sharply over this redshift range--and the
galaxy-formation physics that maps halo mass to galaxy luminosity. We consider
the strong observed evolution in the LF from z~6-10 in this context and
determine whether it can be explained solely by the behavior of the HMF. From
z~6-8, we find a residual change in the physics of galaxy formation
corresponding to a ~0.5 dex increase in the average luminosity of a halo of
fixed mass. On the other hand, our analysis of recent LF measurements at z~10
shows that the paucity of detected galaxies is consistent with almost no change
in the average luminosity at fixed halo mass from z~8. The LF slope also
constrains the variation about this mean such that the luminosity of galaxies
hosted by halos of the same mass are all within about an order-of-magnitude of
each other. We show that these results are well-described by a simple model of
galaxy formation in which cold-flow accretion is balanced by star formation and
momentum-driven outflows. If galaxy formation proceeds in halos with masses
down to 10^8 Msun, then such a model predicts that LBGs at z~10 should be able
to maintain an ionized intergalactic medium as long as the ratio of the
clumping factor to the ionizing escape fraction is C/f_esc < 10.

galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number
densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between
stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a
novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong
constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass
relation (SHMR) from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass
scales as Mh M*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with
redshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh/M*, varies from low
to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh/M*~27 at M*=4.5x10^10 Msun and
Mh=1.2x10^12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation
because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the
central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this
minimum in terms of the ""pivot stellar mass"", M*piv, the ""pivot halo mass"",
Mhpiv, and the ""pivot ratio"", (Mh/M*)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a
single data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for
both Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from
M*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 Msun at z=0.37.
Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot
ratio constant with redshift at (Mh/M*)piv~27. We use simple arguments to show
how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may
ultimately depend on Mh/M* and not simply Mh, as is commonly assumed. We show
that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the
sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in
the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and AGN
feedback.

constraints on the slope of the luminosity function at the extreme faint end

generate from our data the SFR distribution function for the local Universe. We
find that it has a Schechter form, that the faint-end slope has a constant
value (to the limits of our data) of {\alpha} = -1.51 \pm 0.08, and the
'characteristic' SFR is 9.2 M_sun/yr. We also show the distribution function of
the SFR volume density; we then use this to calculate a value for the total SFR
volume density at z ~ 0 of 0.025 \pm 0.0016 M_sun/yr/Mpc^-3, of which ~ 20% is

luminosity, it can be seen that 9 \pm 1% is due to LIRGs, and 0.7 \pm 0.2% is

we also calculate the fraction of star formation occurring in dust obscured

very shallow slope at the highly extincted end, which may be attributable to
line of sight orientation effects as well as conventional internal extinction.

measurement of the parameter fnl that quantifies the departure from Gaussianity

fnl are composed of a sum of products of the temperatures in three different
pixels in the CMB map. Since the number ~Npix^2 of terms in this sum exceeds
the number Npix of measurements, these ~Npix^2 terms cannot be statistically
independent. Therefore, the central-limit theorem does not necessarily apply,
and the probability distribution function (PDF) for the fnl estimator does not
necessarily approach a Gaussian distribution for N_pix >> 1. Although the
variance of the estimators is known, the significance of a measurement of fnl
depends on knowledge of the full shape of its PDF. Here we use Monte Carlo
realizations of CMB maps to determine the PDF for two minimum-variance
estimators: the standard estimator, constructed under the null hypothesis
(fnl=0), and an improved estimator with a smaller variance for |fnl| > 0. While
the PDF for the null-hypothesis estimator is very nearly Gaussian when the true
value of fnl is zero, the PDF becomes significantly non-Gaussian when |fnl| >
0. In this case we find that the PDF for the null-hypothesis estimator fnl_hat
is skewed, with a long non-Gaussian tail at fnl_hat > |fnl| and less
probability at fnl_hat < |fnl| than in the Gaussian case. We provide an
analytic fit to these PDFs. On the other hand, we find that the PDF for the
improved estimator is nearly Gaussian for observationally allowed values of
fnl. We discuss briefly the implications for trispectrum (and other
higher-order correlation) estimators.

Nine of the
systems are new detections and only one of the candidates is a known lens
system. For the most promising five systems including the known lens system, we
present results from preliminary lens mass modelling, which tests if the
candidates are plausible lens systems. Photometric redshifts of the candidate
lens galaxies are obtained from the COMBO-17 galaxy catalog. Stellar masses of
the candidate lens galaxies within the Einstein radius are obtained by using
the $z$-band luminosity and the $V-z$ color-based stellar mass-to-light ratios.
As expected, the lensing masses are found to be larger than the stellar masses
of the candidate lens galaxies. These candidates have similar dark matter
fractions as compared to lenses in SLACS and COSMOS. They also roughly follow
the halo mass-stellar mass relation predicted by the subhalo abundance matching
technique. One of the candidate lens galaxies qualifies as a LIRG and may not
be a true lens because the arc-like feature in the system is likely to be an
active region of star formation in the candidate lens galaxy. Amongst the five
best candidates, one is a confirmed lens system, one is a likely lens system,
two are less likely to be lenses and the status of one of the candidates is
ambiguous. Spectroscopic follow-up of these systems is still required to
confirm lensing and/or for more accurate determination of the lens masses and
mass density profiles.

An isolated, collisionless stellar disk with a MW-like scale-height shows only
the radial ""blurring"" expected from epicyclic orbits. Reducing the disk
thickness or adding gas to the disk substantially increases the level of radial
migration, induced by interaction with transient spiral arms and/or a central
bar. We also examine collisionless disks subjected to gravitational
perturbations from a cosmologically motivated satellite accretion history. In
the perturbed disk that best reproduces the observed properties of the MW, 20%
of stars that end up in the solar annulus 7 kpc < R < 9 kpc started at R < 6
kpc, and 7% started at R > 10 kpc. This level of migration would add
considerable dispersion to the age-metallicity relation of solar neighborhood
stars. In the isolated disk models, the probability of migration traces the
disk's radial mass profile, but in perturbed disks migration occurs
preferentially at large radii, where the disk is more weakly bound. The orbital
dynamics of migrating particles are also different in isolated and perturbed
disks: satellite perturbations drive particles to lower angular momentum for a
given change in radius. Thus, satellite perturbations appear to be a distinct
mechanism for inducing radial migration, which can operate in concert with
migration induced by bars and spiral structure. We investigate correlations
between changes in radius and changes in orbital circularity or vertical
energy, identifying signatures that might be used to test models and
distinguish radial migration mechanisms in chemo-dynamical surveys of the MW
disk.

a precision of sigma_z/(1+z)=1% for galaxies with z<23.3 AB mag. We utilized a

our main analysis. With three different SFR indicators, (1) Spitzer MIPS
24-micron imaging, (2) SED fitting, and (3) [OII]3727 emission, we find the
median specific SFR (SSFR) and SFR to decline from the low-density field to the
cores of groups and a rich cluster. For the SED and [OII] based SFRs, the
decline in SSFR is roughly an order of magnitude while for the MIPS based SFRs,
the decline is a factor of ~4. We find approximately the same magnitude of
decline in SSFR even after removing the sample of galaxies near the cluster.
Galaxies in groups and a cluster at these redshifts therefore have lower star
formation (SF) activity than galaxies in the field, as is the case at z~0. We
investigated whether the decline in SFR with increasing density is caused by a
change in the proportion of quiescent and star forming galaxies (SFGs) or by a
decline in the SFRs of SFGs. Using the rest-frame U-V and V-J colors to
distinguish quiescent galaxies from SFGs we find the fraction of quiescent
galaxies increases from ~32% to 79% from low to high density. In addition, we
find the SSFRs of SFGs, selected based on U-V and V-J colors, to decline with
increasing density by factors of ~5-6 for the SED and [OII] based SFRs. The
MIPS based SSFRs for SFGs decline with a shallower slope. The order of
magnitude decline in the SSFR-density relation at 0.6<z<0.9 is therefore driven
by both a combination of declining SFRs of SFGs as well as a changing mix of
SFGs and quiescent galaxies [ABRIDGED].

mass similar to that of the Milky Way (MW) halo at redshift z=0 (log M/(Msol/h)
= 12.0 to 12.5) and consider flips in the spin of the whole halo or just its
inner parts. We find that a greater fraction of major mergers are associated
with large spin flips than minor mergers. However, since major mergers are
rare, the vast majority (93%) of large whole-halo spin flips (angle change >=
45 degrees) coincide with small mass changes, not major mergers. The spin
vector of the inner halo experiences much more frequent flips than the halo as
a whole. Over their entire lifetimes (i.e. after a halo acquires half of its
final mass), over 10% of halos experience a flip of at least 45 degrees in the
spin of the entire halo and nearly 60 percent experience a flip this large in
the inner halo. These numbers are reduced to 9 percent for the whole halo and
47 percent for the inner halo when we consider only haloes with no major
mergers after formation. Our analysis suggests that spin flips (whose effects

factor in the morphological transformation of disc galaxies.

  Our main tool relaxes the conditions for an EL-labeling, allowing multiple
ascending chains as long as they are lexicographically before non-ascending
chains. We extend results from the theory of EL-shellable posets to such

that a poset with such a labeling is homotopy equivalent (by discrete Morse

impossible for significant levels of disorder due to the ambiguity of the

be obeyed by every proper measure of quantum entanglement. However, this is not
the only aspect of entanglement theory where local unitaries play a relevant
role. In the present work we show that the application of suitable local
unitary operations defines a family of bipartite entanglement monotones,
collectively referred to as ""mirror entanglement"". They are constructed by
first considering the (squared) Hilbert-Schmidt distance of the state from the
set of states obtained by applying to it a given local unitary. To the action
of each different local unitary there corresponds a different distance. We then
minimize these distances over the sets of local unitaries with different
spectra, obtaining an entire family of different entanglement monotones. We
show that these mirror entanglement monotones are organized in a hierarchical
structure, and we establish the conditions that need to be imposed on the
spectrum of a local unitary for the associated mirror entanglement to be
faithful, i.e. to vanish on and only on separable pure states. We analyze in
detail the properties of one particularly relevant member of the family, the
""stellar mirror entanglement"" associated to traceless local unitaries with
nondegenerate spectrum and equispaced eigenvalues in the complex plane. This
particular measure generalizes the original analysis of [Giampaolo and

proportional to the linear entropy and from above by the linear entropy itself,
coinciding with it in two- and three-dimensional spaces.

and strengths of most mid-IR molecular emission features are correlated with
each other, suggesting a common origin and similar excitation conditions. We
note that the line detection efficiency is anti-correlated with the 13/30 um
SED spectral slope, which is a measure of the degree of grain settling in the
disk atmosphere. We also note a correlation between detection efficiency and
H-alpha equivalent width, and tentatively with accretion rate, suggesting that
accretional heating contributes to line excitation. If detected, H2O line
fluxes are correlated with the mid-IR continuum flux, and other co-varying
system parameters, such as L_star. However, significant sample variation,
especially in molecular line ratios, remains. LTE models of the H2O emission
show that line strength is primarily related to the best-fit emitting area, and
this accounts for most source-to-source variation in H2O emitted flux. Best-fit
temperatures and column densities cover only a small range of parameter space,
near 10^{18} cm-2 and 450 K for all sources, suggesting a high abundance of H2O
in many planet-forming regions. Other molecules have a range of excitation
temperatures from ~500-1500 K, also consistent with an origin in planet-forming
regions. We find molecular ratios relative to water of ~10^{-3} for all
molecules, with the exception of CO, for which n(CO)/n(H2O)~1. However, LTE
fitting caveats and differences in the way thermo-chemical modeling results are
reported make comparisons with such models difficult, and highlight the need
for additional observations coupled with the use of line-generating radiative
transfer codes.

based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located
close to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the mass
recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space
could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in
accurately recovering its properties. Via a resolution study we found that most
of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than
30-40 particles. However, also here the phase space finders excelled by
resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders

well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass,
position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).

of AGN pairs with projected separations r_p < 100 kpc and velocity offsets <

address the BH accretion and recent star formation properties in their host
galaxies. AGN pairs experience stronger BH accretion, as measured by their [O
III]5007 luminosities (corrected for contribution from star formation) and
Eddington ratios, than do control samples of single AGNs matched in redshift
and host stellar mass. Their host galaxies have stronger post-starburst
activity and younger mean stellar ages, as indicated by stronger H-delta
absorption and smaller 4000 A break in their spectra. The BH accretion and
recent star formation in the host galaxies both increase with decreasing
projected separation in AGN pairs, for r_p ~< 10-30 kpc. The intensity of BH
accretion, the post-starburst strength, and the mean stellar ages are
correlated between the two AGNs in a pair. The luminosities and Eddington
ratios of AGN pairs are correlated with recent star formation in their host
galaxies, with a scaling relation consistent with that observed in single AGNs.
Our results suggest that galaxy tidal interactions enhance both BH accretion
and star formation in AGN pairs, even though the majority of low redshift AGNs
is not coincident with on-going interactions.

pairs of galaxies, UGC12914/5 and UGC 813/6 deviate from this correlation and
show an excess of radio emission which in both cases originates to a large
extent in a gas bridge connecting the two galactic disks. The radio synchrotron
emission expected from the bridge region is calculated, assuming that the
kinetic energy liberated in the predominantly gas dynamic interaction of the
respective interstellar media (ISM) has produced shock waves that efficiently
accelerate nuclei and electrons to relativistic energies. A simple model for
the acceleration of relativistic particles in these shocks is presented
together with a calculation of the resulting radio emission, its spectral index
and the expected high-energy gamma-ray emission. This process is not related to
star formation. It is found that the nonthermal energy produced in the
collision is large enough to explain the radio emission from the bridge between
the two galaxies. The calculated spectral index at the present time also agrees
with the observed value. The expected gamma-ray emission, on the other hand, is
too low by a factor of several to be detectable even with foreseeable

projection images in the blue wing and line center show a pronounced,
asymmetrically extended component up to ~1.3 stellar radii, while those in the
red wing do not show such a component. The observed 1-D projection images in
the lines can be reasonably explained by a model in which the CO gas within a
region more than half as large as the stellar size is moving slightly outward
with 0--5 km s^-1, while the gas in the remaining region is infalling fast with
20--30 km s^-1. A comparison between the CO line AMBER data taken in 2008 and
2009 shows a significant time variation in the dynamics of the CO line-forming
region in the photosphere and the outer atmosphere. In contrast to the line
data, the reconstructed 1-D projection images in the continuum show only a
slight deviation from a uniform disk or limb-darkened disk. We derive a
uniform-disk diameter of 42.05 +/- 0.05 mas and a power-law-type limb-darkened
disk diameter of 42.49 +/- 0.06 mas and a limb-darkening parameter of (9.7 +/-

an accurate approximation for the GSs in all cases, including the situation
with weak transverse confinement, when the soliton's shape includes a
considerable contribution from higher-order transverse modes, in addition to
the usual ground-state wave function of the respective harmonic oscillator.
Both fundamental GSs and their multipeak bound states are considered. The

circularized and a pair of final circular orbits is obtained. A curve in the
space of eccentricities can be constructed through the computation of
stationary solutions of mean equations including dissipation. The application
to CoRoT-7 system shows that the stationary curve agrees with the result of
numerical simulations of exact equations. A similar investigation performed in
a super-Earth-Jupiter two-planet system shows that the doubly circular state is
accelerated when there is a significant orbital migration of the inner planet,
in comparison with previous results were migration is neglected.

404, which is known to host a nuclear star cluster and potentially an
intermediate-mass black hole (on the order of a few times $10^5$ \Msun). We
find two distinct X-ray sources: a hard, central point source coincident with
the optical and radio centers of the galaxy, and a soft extended region that is
coincident with areas of high H$\alpha$ emission and likely recent star
formation. When we fit the 0.3-8 keV spectra of each region separately, we find
the hard nuclear point source to be dominated by a power law (\PL = 1.88),
while the soft off-nuclear region is best fit by a thermal plasma model ($kT$ =
0.67 keV). We therefore find evidence for both a power law component and hot
gas in the nuclear region of NGC 404. We estimate the 2-10 keV luminosity to be
1.3$^{+0.8}_{-0.5}\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. A low-level of diffuse X-ray
emission is detected out to $\sim$15\as ($\sim$0.2 kpc) from the nucleus. We
compare our results to the observed relationships between power law photon
index and Eddington ratio for both X-ray binaries and low luminosity active
galaxies and find NGC 404 to be consistent with other low luminosity active
galaxies. We therefore favor the conclusion that NGC 404 harbors an

an important challenge in many areas of physics and astronomy. Reversible-jump
Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is an extremely powerful technique for
performing Bayesian model selection, but it suffers from a fundamental
difficulty: it requires jumps between model parameter spaces, but cannot
efficiently explore both parameter spaces at once. Thus, a naive jump between
parameter spaces is unlikely to be accepted in the MCMC algorithm and
convergence is correspondingly slow. Here we demonstrate an interpolation
technique that uses samples from single-model MCMCs to propose inter-model
jumps from an approximation to the single-model posterior of the target
parameter space. The interpolation technique, based on a kD-tree data
structure, is adaptive and efficient in modest dimensionality. We show that our
technique leads to improved convergence over naive jumps in an RJMCMC, and
compare it to other proposals in the literature to improve the convergence of
RJMCMCs. We also demonstrate the use of the same interpolation technique as a
way to construct efficient ""global"" proposal distributions for single-model
MCMCs without prior knowledge of the structure of the posterior distribution,
and discuss improvements that permit the method to be used in
higher-dimensional spaces efficiently.

Hexabundles will allow us to address fundamental questions in astronomy without
the biases introduced by a fixed entrance aperture. We have begun to consider
instrument concepts that exploit hundreds of hexabundles over the widest
possible field of view. To this end, we have compared the performance of a
61-core fully-fused hexabundle and 5 lightly-fused bundles with 7 cores each.
All fibres in the bundles have 100 micron cores. In the fully-fused bundle, the
cores are distorted from a circular shape in order to achieve a higher fill
fraction. The lightly-fused bundles have circular cores and five different
cladding thicknesses which affect the fill fraction. We compare the optical
performance of all 6 bundles and find that the advantage of smaller
interstitial holes (higher fill fraction) is outweighed by the increase in
modal coupling, cross-talk and the poor optical performance caused by the
deformation of the fibre cores. Uniformly high throughput and low cross-talk
are essential for imaging faint astronomical targets with sufficient resolution
to disentangle the dynamical structure. Devices already under development will
have between 100 and 200 lightly-fused cores, although larger formats are
feasible. The light-weight packaging of hexabundles is sufficiently flexible to

with an electrically neutral polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) and doped with
the salt NaCl. PEG causes the isotropic SSY solutions to condense into a
liquid-crystalline region with a high concentration of SSY aggregates,
coexisting with a PEG-rich isotropic (I) region. PEG added to the homogeneous
nematic (N) phase causes separation into the coexisting N and I domains; the
SSY concentration in the N domains is higher than the original concentration of
PEG-free N phase. Finally, addition of PEG to the highly concentrated
homogeneous N phase causes separation into the coexisting columnar hexagonal
(C) phase and I phase. This behavior can be qualitatively explained by the
depletion (excluded volume) effects that act at two different levels: at the
level of aggregate assembly from monomers and short aggregates and at the level
of inter-aggregate packing. We also show a strong effect of a monovalent salt
NaCl on phase diagrams that is different for high and low concentrations of
SSY. Upon the addition of salt, dilute I solutions of SSY show appearance of
the condensed N domains, but the highly concentrated C phase transforms into a
coexisting I and N domains. We suggest that the salt-induced screening of
electric charges at the surface of chromonic aggregates leads to two different
effects: (a) increase of the scission energy and the contour length of
aggregates, and (b) decrease of the persistence length of SSY aggregates.

the way this is done in the classical theory of stochastic processes. Since
quantally mu is generally not of bounded variation, a new method is required.
We propose a method that defines the measure of an event by means of a sequence
of simpler events which in a suitable sense converges to the event whose
measure one is seeking to define. To this end, we introduce canonical sequences
approximating certain events, and we propose a measure-based criterion for the

Despite the impracticality of Gaussian sources, the compact closed-form
expression of mutual information between linear channel Gaussian input and
corresponding output has led to broad application of Gaussian input assumption
in physical secrecy analysis. For practical considerations, we study the effect
of finite discrete-constellation on the achievable secrecy rate of
multiple-antenna wire-tap channels. Our proposed precoding scheme converts the
multi-antenna system into a bank of parallel channels. Based on this precoding
strategy, we propose a decentralized power allocation algorithm based on dual

analyze the achievable secrecy rate for finite-alphabet inputs in low and high

significantly from those of non-recycled pulsars. In particular, the position
angle (PA) swings of many MSPs deviate from the S-shape predicted by the
rotating vector model, even after relativistic aberration is accounted for,
indicating that they have non-dipolar magnetic geometries, likely due to a
history of accretion. Stokes tomography uses phase portraits of the Stokes
parameters as a diagnostic tool to infer a pulsar's magnetic geometry and
orientation. This paper applies Stokes tomography to MSPs, generalizing the
technique to handle interpulse emission. We present an atlas of look-up tables
for the Stokes phase portraits and PA swings of MSPs with current-modified
dipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams, and two empirical linear
polarization models. We compare our look-up tables to data from 15 MSPs and
find that the Stokes phase portraits for a current-modified dipole
approximately match several MSPs whose PA swings are flat or irregular and
cannot be reconciled with the standard axisymmetric rotating vector model. PSR
J1939+2134 and PSR J0437$-$4715 are modelled in detail. The data from PSR
J1939+2134 at 0.61\,GHz can be fitted well with a current-modified dipole at

bioreactors lack information on shear stress and flow distributions within the

stress on cell function. Such knowledge would enable researchers to improve
upon cell culture protocols. Recent work has focused on optimizing the

yield shear stress distributions that are optimized for uniformity centered on
a target value. A topology optimization algorithm coupled to computational

enhances the basic modal language by an operator =(). For propositional
variables p_1,...,p_n the atomic formula =(p_1,...,p_(n-1),p_n) intuitively
states that the value of p_n is determined solely by those of p_1,...,p_(n-1).
We show that model checking for MDL formulae over Kripke structures is
NP-complete and further consider fragments of MDL obtained by restricting the
set of allowed propositional and modal connectives. It turns out that several
fragments, e.g., the one without modalities or the one without propositional
connectives, remain NP-complete. We also consider the restriction of MDL where
the length of each single dependence atom is bounded by a number that is fixed
for the whole logic. We show that the model checking problem for this bounded
MDL is still NP-complete. We additionally extend MDL by allowing classical
disjunction - introduced by Sevenster - besides dependence disjunction and show
that classical disjunction is always at least as computationally bad as bounded
arity dependence atoms and in some cases even worse, e.g., the fragment with
nothing but the two disjunctions is NP-complete. Furthermore we almost
completely classifiy the computational complexity of the model checking problem
for all restrictions of propositional and modal operators for both unbounded as
well as bounded MDL.

response and those determined by plastic instabilities. The minimal observed
frequency is determined by one or the other, crossing at a typical length-scale

more radio loud than `power-law' galaxies ({\gamma}>0.5). This connection,
which indicates possible links between radio-loudness and galaxy formation
history (e.g. through black hole spin) has so far only been confirmed for a
radio-selected sample of galaxies. Furthermore, it has since been shown that
the Nuker law, which was used to parameterise the brightness profiles in these
studies, gives a poor description of the brightness profile. Here, we present
an analysis of the central surface brightness profiles of the active galaxies
of Hubble Type T<3, that were identified by the optically-selected Palomar
spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies. We fit the brightness profiles using
Sersic, Core-Sersic and, where necessary, Double-Sersic models, which we fit to
the semi-major axis brightness profiles extracted from high resolution images
of the galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We use these fits to
classify the galaxies as `Core', `Sersic' or `Double-Sersic' and compare this
classification with the properties of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We
find that AGN hosted in Core galaxies are generally more radio-loud than those
hosted in Sersic galaxies, although there is a large overlap between the two
subsamples. The correlation between radio-loudness and brightness profile can
partly be explained by a correlation between radio-loudness and black hole
mass. Additionally, there is a significant (99 per cent confidence) partial
correlation between radio-loudness and the Core/Sersic classification of the

ultrafilter, where the definition of a tight filter is obtained by combining
work of both Exel and Lenz. A simple necessary condition for a semigroup to be

shown to satisfy it. Thus the polycyclic inverse monoids, and certain Rees
matrix semigroups over the polycyclics, are pre-Boolean and it is proved that
the groups of units of their completions are precisely the Thompson-Higman

August 28. XMM-Newton observed the source on 2010 September 9-10, for 22ks.
INTEGRAL observations were part of the publicly available Galactic Bulge
program, and overlapped with the times covered by XMM-Newton. The broad-band
spectroscopy resulted in a best-fit with an absorbed power law displaying a
photon index of 1.61+/-0.01, an absorbing column density of (5.10+/-0.05)E21
cm-2, and a flux of 2.4E-10 erg/cm2/s (1-100 keV), corrected for the
absorption. The data did not require either a spectral cut-off (E>50 keV) or an
additional soft component. The slopes of the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL separate
spectra were compatible, within the uncertainties. The timing analysis does not
show evidence either for X-ray pulsations or for type I X-ray bursts. The broad
band X-ray spectrum as well as the power density spectrum are indicative of a
low hard state in a low mass X-ray binary, although nothing conclusive can be
said about the nature of the compact object (neutron star or black hole). The
results we are reporting here allow us to conclude that IGRJ17285-2922 is a low
mass X-ray binary, located at a distance greater than 4 kpc.

interchange between in-states and out-states. I explain a methodology to
perform model-indepedent separate measurements of the three CP, T and CPT
symmetry violations for transitions involving the decay of the neutral meson
systems in B- and {\Phi}-factories. It makes use of the quantum-mechanical
entanglement only, for which the individual state of each neutral meson is not
defined before the decay of its orthogonal partner. The final proof of the
independence of the three asymmetries is that no other theoretical ingredient
is involved and that the event sample corresponding to each case is different
from the other two. The experimental analysis for the measurements of these
three asymmetries as function of the time interval {\Delta}t > 0 between the
first and second decays is discussed, as well as the significance of the
expected results. In particular, one may advance a first observation of true,
direct, evidence of Time-Reserval-Violation in B-factories by many standard
deviations from zero, without any reference to, and independent of,
CP-Violation. In some quantum gravity framework the CPT-transformation is
ill-defined, so there is a resulting loss of particle-antiparticle identity.
This mechanism induces a breaking of the EPR correlation in the entanglement
imposed by Bose statistics to the neutral meson system, the so-called
{\omega}-effect. I present results and prospects for the {\omega}-parameter in
the correlated neutral meson-antimeson states.

state available non-causally at only the source. Such a model may be of
interest for node cooperation in the framework of cognition, i.e.,
collaborative signal transmission involving cognitive and non-cognitive radios.
We study the capacity of this communication model. One principal problem is
caused by the relay's not knowing the channel state. For the discrete
memoryless (DM) model, we establish two lower bounds and an upper bound on
channel capacity. The first lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme in which
the source describes the state of the channel to the relay and destination,
which then exploit the gained description for a better communication of the
source's information message. The coding scheme for the second lower bound
remedies the relay's not knowing the states of the channel by first computing,
at the source, the appropriate input that the relay would send had the relay
known the states of the channel, and then transmitting this appropriate input
to the relay. The relay simply guesses the sent input and sends it in the next
block. The upper bound is non trivial and it accounts for not knowing the state
at the relay and destination. For the general Gaussian model, we derive lower
bounds on the channel capacity by exploiting ideas in the spirit of those we
use for the DM model; and we show that these bounds are optimal for small and
large noise at the relay irrespective to the strength of the interference.
Furthermore, we also consider a special case model in which the source input
has two components one of which is independent of the state. We establish a
better upper bound for both DM and Gaussian cases and we also characterize the
capacity in a number of special cases.

For a simulation in which an initially uniform magnetic field of strength

field is swept into alignment with the pillar during its dynamical evolution,
in agreement with observations of the ""Pillars of Creation"" in M16, and of some
cometary globules. This effect is significantly enhanced when the simulation is
re-run with a weaker field of 18 uG. A stronger field with |B|=160 uG is
sufficient to prevent this evolution completely, also significantly affecting
the photoionisation process. Using a larger simulation domain it is seen that

timelike and null curves; these are essential to model physical observers and
the propagation of light. We prove that the timelike directions form an open

merger, as a prompt emission during the collapse of a NS and at the spin-down
stage of the resulting BH. We demonstrate that the time evolution of the
axisymmetric force-free magnetic fields can be expressed in terms of the
hyperbolic Grad-Shafranov equation. We find exact non-linear time-dependent
split-monopole structure of magnetosphere driven by spinning and collapsing NS
in Schwarzschild geometry. Based on this solution, we argue that the collapse
of a NS into the BH happens smoothly, without natural formation of current
sheets or other dissipative structures on the open field lines and, thus, does
not allow the magnetic field to become disconnected from the star and escape to
infinity. Thus, as long as an isolated Kerr BH can produce plasma and currents,
it does not lose its open magnetic field lines, its magnetospheric structure
evolved towards a split monopole and the BH spins down electromagnetically. The
""no hair theorem"", which assumes that the outside medium is a vacuum, is not
applicable in this case: highly conducting plasma introduces a topological
constraint forbidding the disconnection of the magnetic field lines from the
BH. Eventually, a single random large scale spontaneous reconnection event will
lead to magnetic field release, shutting down the electromagnetic BH engine
forever. We also discuss the nature of short Gamma Ray Bursts and suggest that
the similarity of the early afterglows properties of long and short GRBs can be
related to the fact that in both cases a spinning BH can retains magnetic field
for sufficiently long time to extract a large fraction of its rotation energy

investigate the dispersion of small inertial particles in turbulent flows is
the accuracy with which particle statistics and concentration can be
reproduced. The motion of particles in LES fields may differ significantly from
that observed in experiments or direct numerical simulation (DNS) because the
force acting on the particles is not accurately estimated, due to the
availability of the only filtered fluid velocity, and because errors accumulate
in time leading to a progressive divergence of the trajectories. This may lead
to different degrees of inaccuracy in the prediction of statistics and
concentration. We identify herein an ideal subgrid correction of the a-priori
LES fluid velocity seen by the particles in turbulent channel flow. This
correction is computed by imposing that the trajectories of individual
particles moving in filtered DNS fields exactly coincide with the particle
trajectories in a DNS. In this way the errors introduced by filtering into the
particle motion equations can be singled out and analyzed separately from those
due to the progressive divergence of the trajectories. The subgrid correction
term, and therefore the filtering error, is characterized in the present paper
in terms of statistical moments. The effects of the particle inertia and of the
filter type and width on the properties of the correction term are

formation rate and local density, confirming the results based on Spitzer 24 um

formation rate also for AGN hosts, we identify in this class of objects the
cause for the reversal of the density-SFR relation. Indeed, AGN hosts favor
high stellar masses, dense regions and high star formation rates. Without the
AGN contribution the relation flattens consistently with respect to the local
analog in the same range of star formation rates. As in the local universe, the
specific star formation rate anti-correlates with the density. This is due to
mass segregation both at high and low redshift. The contribution of AGN hosts
does not affect this anti-correlation, since AGN hosts exhibit the same
specific star formation rate as star forming galaxies at the same mass. The
same global trends and AGN contribution is observed once the relations are
studied per morphological type. We study the specific star formation rate vs
stellar mass relation in three density regimes. Our data provides an indication
that at M/M_{\odot} > 10^{11} the mean specific star formation rate tends to be
higher at higher density, while the opposite trend is observed in the local

Spitzer SAGE (Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution) data with the
ATCA/Parkes HI 21-cm data, the NANTEN 12CO (J=1-0) data, and both the SHASSA
H{\alpha} and the Parkes 6-cm data, we investigate the physical properties of
dust associated with the different phases of the gas (atomic, molecular and
ionized). In particular, we study the presence and nature of dust from 3.6 to
160 {\mu}m and for various regimes of the ionized gas, spanning emission
measures (EM) from \sim 1 pc cm-6 (diffuse component) to \sim 10^3 pc cm-6 (HII
regions). Using a dust emission model, and testing our results with several
radiation field spectra, we show that dust in the ionized gas is warmer than
dust associated with other phases (atomic and molecular). We also find a
decrease of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) relative abundance with
respect to big grains (BGs), as well as an increase of the near infrared (NIR)
continuum. These three results (e.g. warmer temperature, decrease of PAH
abundance and increase of the NIR continuum) are found consistently for all
regimes of the ionized gas. On the contrary, the molecular phase appears to
provide favorable conditions for the survival of PAHs. Furthermore, the very
small grain (VSG) relative abundance tends to increase in the ionized phase,
especially in bright HII regions. Last but not least, our analysis shows that
the emissivity of dust associated with the ionized gas is lower in the LMC than
in our Galaxy, and that this difference is not accounted for by the lower
metallicity of the LMC.

Einstein's formula is recovered as a first-order asymptotic expansion of the

the normalisation of the power law which fits the X-ray/radio and
X-ray/infrared luminosity correlations L_(radio/IR) proportional to
L_(X)^(Gamma) (using infrared data for which there is evidence for jet
emission). We find a possible relation between spin frequency and jet power
(Spearman rank 97%), when fitting the X-ray/radio luminosity correlation using
a power law with slope 1.4; Gamma=1.4 is observed in 4U 1728-34 and is
predicted for a radiatively efficient disc and a total jet power proportional
to the mass accretion rate. If we use a slope of 0.6, as observed in Aql X-1,
no significant relation is found. An indication for a similar positive
correlation is also found for accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (Spearman
rank 92%), if we fit the X-ray/infrared luminosity correlation using a power
law with slope 1.4. While our use of the normalisation of the luminosity
correlations as a measure of the ranking jet power is subject to large
uncertainties, no better proxy for the jet power is available. However, we urge
caution in over-interpreting the spin-jet power correlations, particularly
given the strong dependence of our result on the (highly uncertain) assumed

empty void. I also discuss another extreme case: Andromeda IV, a dwarf
considered here for the first time in light of MOND, with a very large mass
discrepancy, Gamma =12, also conforming accurately to the MOND prediction. In
both cases, MOND predicts Gamma, or the total dynamical mass at the last
observed radius, from only the knowledge of the small mass of baryons. If MOND
is accepted as the root of the mass discrepancy, these are just two more
expected, albeit reassuring, conformities. However, in the framework of the
dark-matter paradigm--where the mass discrepancy is strongly dependent on the
buildup history of a galaxy--every new such conformity with a tight law is
another difficult-to-understand surprise, and does carry a new import: What, in
the LCDM paradigm, would prevent such galactic baryons from residing in a halo
of half, or twice, the observed rotational velocities, instead of selecting
exactly the velocities predicted by MOND? This conundrum is especially poignant
for KK246, whose great isolation points to a relatively unique buildup history.

the inflection point $T_k$ of the first derivative of ac-susceptibility, where
$\kappa \approx k$. The temperature crossovers to the highly chiral fluctuating
state is associated with the enhancing influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moria
interaction close to $T_c$.

Epitaxy) technique requires precise control of each source flux. However, when
the component elements have significantly different oxygen affinities,
maintaining stable fluxes for easily oxidizing elements is challenging because
of a source oxidation problem. Here, using Sr as a test source, we show that a
crucible aperture insert scheme significantly reduces the source oxidation in
an oxide-MBE environment. The crucible aperture insert was shaped like a disk
with a hole at the center and was mounted inside the crucible; it blocks most
of the oxygen species coming to the source, thus reducing the source oxidation.
However, the depth of the aperture disk was critical for its performance; an
ill-positioned aperture could make the flux stability even worse. With an
optimally positioned aperture insert, the crucible exhibited more than four
times improvement in Sr flux stability, compared to a conventional,
non-apertured crucible.

heteroepitaxial thin films is studied via a continuum elasticity model and the
development of a nonlinear dynamic equation governing the film morphological
profile. All three regimes of island array evolution are identified and
examined, including a film instability regime at early stage, a nonlinear
coarsening regime at intermediate times, and the crossover to a saturated
asymptotic state, with detailed behavior depending on film-substrate misfit
strains but not qualitatively on finite system sizes. The phenomenon of island
stabilization and saturation, which corresponds to the formation of steady but
non-ordered arrays of strained quantum dots, occurs at later time for smaller
misfit strain. It is found to be controlled by the strength of film-substrate
wetting interaction which would constrain the valley-to-peak mass transport and
hence the growth of island height, and also determined by the effect of elastic
interaction between surface islands and the high-order strain energy of
individual islands at late evolution stage. The results are compared to
previous experimental and theoretical studies on quantum dots coarsening and
saturation.

that the HXR emission (14-23 keV) is present for tens of minutes after flare
maximum. Hence, some heating process is expected to exist during that time. The
better energy resolution of RHESSI compared to HXT allow us to analyse LDEs in
more comprehensive way.
  Aims: We selected three LDEs observed by RHESSI to answer the questions how
long HXR emission can be present, where it is emitted, what is its nature and
how much energy should be released to sustain the emission.
  Methods: We used RHESSI data to reconstruct images of the selected flares
with an energy resolution as good as 1 keV. Next we estimated physical
parameters of HXR sources through imaging spectroscopy. The physical parameters
obtained were then used to calculate the energy balance of the observed
sources.
  Results: We found that HXR thermal emission can be present for many hours
after LDE flare maximum. The emission comes from large and hot loop-top
sources. The total energy that must be released to sustain the emission of the
sources is as high as 10^31 erg.

consequence of spatial shaping of the laser shock generation pulse into a ring

slip line rectifier. This transition is characterized by a strong increase in
