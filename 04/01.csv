Classical Cepheids. We derive an empirical calibration of the apparent
luminosities of Cepheids as measured from the optical through the mid-infrared
(0.45-8.0um) as a function of spectroscopic [Fe/H] abundances of individual
Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud from Romaniello et al. (2008). The
cumulative trend over the entire wavelength range shows a nearly monotonic
behavior. The sense of the trend is consistent with differential
line-blanketing in the optical, leading to stars of high metallicity being
fainter in the optical. This is followed by a reversal in the trend at longer
wavelengths, with the cross-over occurring near the K band at about 2.2um,
consistent with a subsequent redistribution of energy resulting in a mild
brightening of Cepheids (with increased metallicity) at mid-infrared
wavelengths. This conclusion agrees with that of Romaniello et al. based on a
differential comparison of the mean V- and K-band Leavitt Laws for the Galaxy,
SMC and LMC, but is opposite in sign to most other empirical tests of the
sensitivity of Cepheid distances to mean [O/H] HII region abundances. We also
search for a correlation of Cepheid host-galaxy metallicity with deviations of
the galaxy's Cepheid distance from that predicted from a pure Hubble flow.
Based on Cepheid distances to 26 nearby galaxies in the local flow, only a very
weak signal is detected giving Dmu_o = -0.17 (+/- 0.31) ([O/H] - 8.80) - 0.21
(+/-0.10). This is in agreement with previous determinations, but statistically
inconclusive.

radon in a MAC-E filter generates background events, based on measurements
performed at the KATRIN pre-spectrometer test setup. Radon (Rn) atoms, which
emanate from materials inside the vacuum region of the KATRIN spectrometers,
are able to penetrate deep into the magnetic flux tube so that the alpha-decay
of Rn contributes to the background. Of particular importance are electrons
emitted in processes accompanying the Rn alpha-decay, such as shake-off,
internal conversion of excited levels in the Rn daughter atoms and Auger
electrons. While low-energy electrons (< 100 eV) directly contribute to the
background in the signal region, higher energy electrons can be stored
magnetically inside the volume of the spectrometer. Depending on their initial
energy, they are able to create thousands of secondary electrons via subsequent
ionization processes with residual gas molecules and, since the detector is not
able to distinguish these secondary electrons from the signal electrons, an
increased background rate over an extended period of time is generated.

spatial and temporal ergodicity. All transmitters in the network form a
homogeneous Poisson point process and all channels are modeled by a finite

these results, we show that the ETC can be characterized by the inner product
of the channel-state related vector and the invariant probability vector of the
Markov chain. This indicates that channel-aware opportunistic transmission does
not always increase ETC. Finally, we look at outage probability with
interference management from a stochastic geometry point of view. The improved

the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model obtained by the
ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the lHC with $\sqrt s=7$ TeV and 36 pb$^{-1}$
of data. The main production and detection channel that is relevant in these
analyses is the gluon--gluon and bottom quark fusion mechanisms leading to
neutral Higgs bosons which subsequently decay into tau lepton pairs, $gg, b\bar
b \to Higgs \to \tau^+\tau^-$. In this note, we show that: i) the exclusion
limits are in fact more general than indicated by the ATLAS and CMS analyses
and are essentially independent of the scenario for the supersymmetric particle
spectrum; ii) when the exclusion limits are applied to the lowest theory
prediction for the Higgs production cross section times branching ratio, when
all theoretical uncertainties are taken into account, the bounds are somewhat
less stringent; iii) the exclusion limits from the $pp \to Higgs \to \tau^+
\tau^-$ process are so strong that only a modest improvement would be possible
when other MSSM Higgs detection channels are considered, even with femtobarn
level accumulated data. Finally and most important, we point out that the
prospects for the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the inclusive
$gg \to H \to \tau^+\tau^-$ channel, that is not currently considered by the
ATLAS and CMS collaborations, turn out to be very promising and with a few
inverse femtobarn data it might provide a convincing discovery signal in the
difficult 115--135 GeV mass range for the standard Higgs boson.

multi-particle final states. To apply them to the simulation of medium-modified
jets in heavy ion collisions, a probabilistic implementation of medium-induced
quantum interference effects is needed. Here, we analyze in detail how the
quantum interference effects included in the BDMPS-Z formalism of
medium-induced gluon radiation can be implemented in a quantitatively
controlled, local probabilistic parton cascade. The resulting MC algorithm is
formulated in terms of elastic and inelastic mean free paths, and it is by
construction insensitive to the IR and UV divergences of the total elastic and
inelastic cross sections that serve as its basic building blocks in the
incoherent limit. Interference effects are implemented by reweighting gluon
production histories as a function of the number of scattering centers that act
within the gluon formation time. Unlike existing implementations based on gluon
formation time, we find generic arguments for why a quantitative implementation
of quantum interference cannot amount to a mere dead-time requirement for
subsequent gluon production. We validate the proposed MC algorithm by comparing
MC simulations with parametric dependencies and analytical results of the
BDMPS-Z formalism. In particular, we show that the MC algorithm interpolates
correctly between analytically known limiting cases for totally coherent and
incoherent gluon production, and that it accounts quantitatively for the
medium-induced gluon energy distribution and the resulting average parton
energy loss. We also verify that the MC algorithm implements the transverse
momentum broadening of the BDMPS-Z formalism. We finally discuss why the
proposed MC algorithm provides a suitable starting point for going beyond the
approximations of the BDMPS-Z formalism.

algorithm to address the issue of field size in random network coding. ARCNC
operates as a convolutional code, with the coefficients of local encoding
kernels chosen randomly over a small finite field. The lengths of local
encoding kernels increase with time until the global encoding kernel matrices
at related sink nodes all have full rank. Instead of estimating the necessary
field size a priori, ARCNC operates in a small finite field. It adapts to
unknown network topologies without prior knowledge, by locally incrementing the
dimensionality of the convolutional code. Because convolutional codes of
different constraint lengths can coexist in different portions of the network,
reductions in decoding delay and memory overheads can be achieved with ARCNC.
We show through analysis that this method performs no worse than random linear
network codes in general networks, and can provide significant gains in terms
of average decoding delay in combination networks.

features due to OVII, OVIII, NVI, NVII and CVI. We also detected signatures of
weak emission lines of He-like triplets from OVII and NVI ions. The emission
lines are well described by two warm emitting, photoionised media with
different densities but comparable xi, suggesting discrete clouds of warm
emission. The high density phase (n_e ~ 10^{13} per cc) responsible for the
resonance lines appears to outflow at high velocity ~ 5000 km/s. The low
velocity, low density phase is likely similar to the X-ray line emitting
regions found in Seyfert 2 galaxies. The physical conditions of warm emitters

absorption along our line of sight and in emission at other lines of sight. The
unique line of sight passing close to the torus opening angle is likely
responsible for the neutral partial covering absorption and our view of
emission lines due to the suppressed continuum in this polar scattered Seyfert

collisions relative to their production in p+p collisions scaled by the number
of binary collisions. In order to determine if this suppression is related to
color screening of these states in the produced medium, one needs to account
for other nuclear modifications including those in cold nuclear matter. In this
paper, we present new measurements from the PHENIX 2007 data set of J/psi
yields at forward rapidity (1.2<|y|<2.2) in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200
GeV. The data confirm the earlier finding that the suppression of J/psi at
forward rapidity is stronger than at midrapidity, while also extending the
measurement to finer bins in collision centrality and higher transverse
momentum (pT). We compare the experimental data to the most recent theoretical
calculations that incorporate a variety of physics mechanisms including gluon
saturation, gluon shadowing, initial-state parton energy loss, cold nuclear
matter breakup, color screening, and charm recombination. We find J/psi
suppression beyond cold-nuclear-matter effects. However, the current level of
disagreement between models and d+Au data precludes using these models to
quantify the hot-nuclear-matter suppression.

as an approximation to a fundamentally discrete substructure, the causal set,
which is a locally finite partially ordered set. The causal set paradigm was
elucidated in a classic paper by Bombelli, Lee, Meyer and Sorkin in 1987. While
early kinematical results already showed promise, the program received a
substantial impetus about a decade ago with the work of Rideout and Sorkin on a
classical stochastic growth dynamics for causal sets. Considerable progress has
been made ever since in our understanding of causal set theory while leaving
undisturbed the basic paradigm. Recent highlights include a causal set
expression for the Einstein-Hilbert action and the construction of a scalar
field Feynman propagator on a fixed causal set. The aim of the present article
is to give a broad overview of the results in causal set theory while pointing
out directions for future investigations.

$D$-meson interactions with thermal pions are approximated by $D^*$ resonances,
while scattering off other hadrons ($K$, $\eta$, $\rho$, $\omega$, $K^*$, $N$,
$\Delta$) is evaluated using vacuum scattering amplitudes as available in the
literature based on effective Lagrangians and constrained by realistic

found to be around 25-50\,fm/$c$ for temperatures $T$=150-180\,MeV, which
reduces to 10-25\,fm/$c$ in a hadron-resonance gas. The latter values, argued
to be conservative estimates, imply significant modifications of $D$-meson
spectra in heavy-ion collisions. Close to the critical temperature ($T_c$), the
spatial diffusion coefficient ($D_s$) is surprisingly similar to recent
calculations for charm quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma using non-perturbative

This is explained by assuming that the Hii clouds are recently formed out of

within the framework of quantum Hall ferromagnetism. We perform a systematic
analysis of the pseudospin anisotropies, which arise from the valley and
sublattice asymmetric short-range electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon
(e-ph) interactions. The phase diagram, obtained in the presence of generic
pseudospin anisotropy and the Zeeman effect, consists of four phases
characterized by the following orders: spin-polarized ferromagnetic, canted
antiferromagnetic, charge density wave, and Kekul\'{e} distortion. We take into
account the Landau level mixing effects and show that they result in the key
renormalizations of parameters. First, the absolute values of the anisotropy
energies become greatly enhanced and can significantly exceed the Zeeman
energy. Second, the signs of the anisotropy energies due to e-e interactions
can change upon renormalization. A crucial consequence of the latter is that
the short-range e-e interactions alone could favor any state on the phase
diagram, depending on the details of interactions at the lattice scale. On the
other hand, the leading e-ph interactions always favor the Kekul\'{e}
distortion order. The possibility of inducing phase transitions by tilting the
magnetic field is discussed.

with metals from supernovae and stars. It is well established that the
enrichment of the gas with elements from oxygen to iron is mainly caused by
supernova explosions. The origins of nitrogen and carbon are still being
debated. Possible candidates include massive, metal-rich stars, early
generations of massive stars, intermediate or low mass stars and Asymptotic
Giant Branch (AGB) stars. In this paper we accurately determine the metal
abundances of the gas in the groups of galaxies NGC 5044 and NGC 5813, and
discuss the nature of the objects that create these metals.
  We mainly focus on carbon and nitrogen. We use spatially-resolved
high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy from XMM-Newton. For the spectral fitting,
multi-temperature hot gas models are used. The abundance ratios of carbon over
oxygen and nitrogen over oxygen that we find are high compared to the ratios in
the stars in the disk of our Galaxy. The oxygen and nitrogen abundances we
derive are similar to what was found in earlier work on other giant ellipticals
in comparable environments. We show that the iron abundances in both our
sources have a gradient along the cross-dispersion direction of the Reflection
Grating Spectrometer (RGS). We conclude that it is unlikely that the creation
of nitrogen and carbon takes place in massive stars, which end their lives as
core-collapse supernovae, enriching the medium with oxygen because oxygen
should then also be enhanced. Therefore we favour low-and intermediate mass
stars as sources of these elements. The abundances in the hot gas can best be
explained by a 30-40% contribution of type Ia supernovae based on the measured
oxygen and iron abundances and under the assumption of a Salpeter Initial Mass
Function (IMF).

ionized by stellar X-rays, well-coupled to magnetic fields, and sustains a
turbulent accretion flow driven by magneto-rotational instability, while the
interior is resistive and magnetically dead.
  The turbulent layers heat by absorbing the light from the central star and by
dissipating the magnetic fields. They are optically-thin to their own radiation
and cool inefficiently. The optically-thick interior in contrast is heated only
weakly, by re-emission from the atmosphere. The interior is colder than a
classical viscous model, and isothermal.
  The magnetic fields support an extended atmosphere that absorbs the starlight
1.5 times higher than the hydrostatic viscous model. The disk thickness thus
measures not the internal temperature, but the magnetic field strength.
Fluctuations in the fields move the starlight-absorbing surface up and down.
The height ranges between 13% and 24% of the radius over timescales of several
orbits, with implications for infrared variability.
  The fields are buoyant, so the accretion heating occurs higher in the
atmosphere than the stresses. The heating is localized around current sheets,
caused by magneto-rotational instability at lower elevations and by Parker
instability at higher elevations. Gas in the sheets is heated above the stellar
irradiation temperature, even though accretion is much less than irradiation
power when volume-averaged. The hot optically-thin current sheets might be
detectable through their line emission.

can be thought as one of the most efficient engines of Nature, perhaps even
more efficient than accretion. We are starting to disclose these features
through a detailed study of their properties, made possible by the analysis of
the energy band where they emit most of their electromagnetic output, namely
the gamma-ray band. That is why the observations by the Fermi satellite and by
the ground based Cherenkov telescopes are crucial to understand extragalactic
jets. At the start, we believe they are magnetically dominated. And yet, on the
scale where they emit most of their luminosity, their power is already in the
form of kinetic energy of particles. The spectral properties of bright sources
show a trend, controlled mainly by the bolometric apparent luminosity. With
improved sensitivity, and the detection of weaker sources, we can explore the
idea that the spectral trends are a result of the same physical quantities
controlling the emission of non-jetted sources: the black hole mass and the
accretion rate. This is based on recent results on sources showing a thermal
component in their spectrum, besides a non-thermal continuum. That the jet
power should be linked to accretion is intriguing. Most of the apparent
diversity of extragalactic radio sources can then be understood on the basis of
the viewing angle, controlling the relativistic Doppler boosting of the

systems are survivors of violent dynamical instabilities. Here we explore how
giant planet instabilities affect the formation and survival of terrestrial
planets. We simulate planetary system evolution around Sun-like stars from
initial conditions that comprise: an inner disk of planetesimals and planetary
embryos, three giant planets at Jupiter-Saturn distances, and a massive outer
planetesimal disk. We then calculate dust production rates and debris disk SEDs
assuming that each planetesimal particle represents an ensemble of smaller
bodies in collisional equilibrium. We predict a strong correlation between the
presence of terrestrial planets and debris disks, mediated by the giant
planets. Strong giant planet instabilities destroy all rocky material -
including fully-formed terrestrial planets if the instabilities occur late -
along with the icy planetesimals. Stable or weakly unstable systems allow
terrestrial planets to accrete and significant dust to be produced in their
outer regions. Stars older than ~100 Myr with bright cold dust emission (at ~70
microns) signpost the dynamically calm environments conducive to efficient
terrestrial accretion. We predict that while the typical eccentricities of
terrestrial planets are small, there should exist a novel class of terrestrial
planet system whose single planet undergoes large amplitude oscillations in
eccentricity and inclination. By scaling to the observed semimajor axis
distribution of giant exoplanets, we estimate that terrestrial exoplanets in
the same systems should be a few times more abundant at 0.5 AU than giant or
terrestrial exoplanets at 1 AU. Finally, we discuss the Solar System, which
appears to be unusual in combining a rich terrestrial planet system with a low

account both galaxy evolution and the perturbing effects of large scale

jointly estimating both the luminosity function (LF) and the overdensity as a
function of redshift. The random catalogue algorithm then works by cloning each
galaxy in the original catalogue, with the number of clones determined by the
ML solution. Each of these cloned galaxies is then assigned a random redshift
uniformly distributed over the accessible survey volume, taking account of the
survey magnitude limit(s) and, optionally, both luminosity and number density
evolution. The resulting random catalogues, which can be employed in
traditional estimates of galaxy clustering, make fuller use of the information
available in the original catalogue and hence are superior to simply fitting a
functional form to the observed redshift distribution. They are particularly
well suited to studies of the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy
properties as each galaxy in the random catalogue has the same list of
attributes as measured for the galaxies in the genuine catalogue. The
derivation of the joint overdensity and LF estimator reveals the limit in which
the ML estimate reduces to the standard 1/Vmax LF estimate, namely when one
makes the prior assumption that the are no fluctuations in the radial
overdensity. The new ML estimator can be viewed as a generalization of the
1/Vmax estimate in which Vmax is replaced by a density corrected Vdc,max.

spectral features and transit depths consistent with those obtained by
Charbonneau and collaborators. The most likely atmospheric composition for GJ

haze layer that is obscuring transit depth differences at shorter wavelengths,

producing the large-scale, bipolar jets commonly seen in protostellar systems.
I present a detailed formulation of a global, radially self-similar model for a
non-ideal disk that launches a magnetocentrifugal wind. This formulation
generalizes the conductivity tensor formalism previously used in radially
localized disk models. The model involves matching a solution of the equations
of non-ideal MHD describing matter in the disk to a solution of the equations
of ideal MHD describing a ""cold"" wind. The disk solution must pass smoothly
through the sonic point, the wind solution must pass smoothly through the
Alfv\'en point, and the two solutions must match at the disk/wind interface.
This model includes for the first time a self-consistent treatment of the
evolution of magnetic flux threading the disk, which can change on the disk
accretion timescale. The formulation presented here also allows a realistic
conductivity profile for the disk to be used in a global disk/wind model for
the first time. The physical constraints on the model solutions fix the
distribution of the magnetic field threading the disk, the midplane accretion
speed, and the midplane migration speed of flux surfaces. I present a
representative solution that corresponds to a disk in the ambipolar
conductivity regime with a nominal neutral-matter--magnetic-field coupling
parameter that is constant along field lines, matched to a wind solution. I
conclude with a brief discussion of the importance of self-similar disk/wind
models in studying global processes such as dust evolution in protostellar

can only break the symmetry in ways in which it was broken by the initial
state, and its measure of asymmetry can be no greater than that of the initial
state. It follows that for the purpose of understanding the consequences of
symmetries of dynamics, in particular, complicated and open-system dynamics, it
is useful to introduce the notion of a state's asymmetry properties, which
includes the type and measure of its asymmetry. We demonstrate and exploit the
fact that the asymmetry properties of a state can also be understood in terms
of information-theoretic concepts, for instance in terms of the state's ability
to encode information about an element of the symmetry group. We show that the
asymmetry properties of a pure state psi relative to the symmetry group G are
completely specified by the characteristic function of the state, defined as
chi_psi(g)=<psi|U(g)|psi> where g\in G and U is the unitary representation of
interest. For a symmetry described by a compact Lie group G, we show that two
pure states can be reversibly interconverted one to the other by symmetric
operations if and only if their characteristic functions are equal up to a
1-dimensional representation of the group. Characteristic functions also allow
us to easily identify the conditions for one pure state to be converted to
another by symmetric operations (in general irreversibly) for the various
paradigms of single-copy transformations: deterministic, state-to-ensemble,
stochastic and catalyzed.

at redshifts 0.025<z<0.05 and have stellar masses in the range
10.0<log(M*/Msun)<11.5. The IRAM measurements are complemented by deep Arecibo
HI observations and homogeneous SDSS and GALEX photometry. A reference sample
that includes both UV and far-IR data is used to calibrate our estimates of
star formation rates from the seven optical/UV bands. The mean molecular gas
depletion timescale, tdep(H2), for all the galaxies in our sample is 1 Gyr,
however tdep(H2) increases by a factor of 6 from a value of ~0.5 Gyr for
galaxies with stellar masses of 10^10 Msun to ~3 Gyr for galaxies with masses
of a few times 10^11 Msun. In contrast, the atomic gas depletion timescale
remains contant at a value of around 3 Gyr. This implies that in high mass
galaxies, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales are comparable, but in
low mass galaxies, molecular gas is being consumed much more quickly than
atomic gas. The strongest dependences of tdep(H2) are on the stellar mass of
the galaxy (parameterized as log tdep(H2)= (0.36+/-0.07)(log M* -
10.70)+(9.03+/-0.99)), and on the specific star formation rate. A single

displaced with respect to the local galaxy population in the tdep(H2) versus

reason these patterns of direct connections are critical is that they establish
the pathways through which elements influence each other indirectly. Here, we
tested a hypothesized consequence of connectivity in ecosystems: the
homogenization of resource distributions in flow networks. Specifically, we
tested the generality of the systems ecology hypothesis of resource
homogenization in 50 empirically derived trophic ecosystem models representing
35 distinct ecosystems. We applied Ecological Network Analysis to calculate
resource homogenization for these models. We further evaluated the robustness
of our results in two ways. First, we verified the close correspondence between
the input- and output-oriented homogenization values to ensure that our results
were not biased by our decision to focus on the output orientation. Second, we
conducted a Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis to determine the robustness
of our results to +/-5% error introduced into the original flow matrices for
each model. Our results show that resource homogenization occurs universally in
the 50 ecosystem models tested. We confirm that our results are not biased by
using the output-oriented homogenization values because there is a significant
linear regression between the input and output oriented homogenization (r^2 =
0.38, p < 0.001). Finally, we found that our results are robust to +/-5% error

these prosaic concerns is to encode and process the information using
topological manipulations of so-called anyons, particles in two dimensions with

that the relative frequency with which these motifs appear in the network can
be used to define the information content of the network. This information is
defined in such a way that a network with random coloration (but keeping the
relative number of nodes with different colors the same) has zero color
information content. Thus, colored motif information captures the
exceptionality of coloring in the motifs that is maintained via selection. We
study the motif information content of the C. elegans brain as well as the
evolution of colored motif information in networks that reflect the interaction
between instructions in genomes of digital life organisms. While we find that
colored motif information appears to capture essential functionality in the C.
elegans brain (where the color assignment of nodes is straightforward) it is
not obvious whether the colored motif information content always increases
during evolution, as would be expected from a measure that captures network
complexity. For a single choice of color assignment of instructions in the
digital life form Avida, we find rather that colored motif information content
increases or decreases during evolution, depending on how the genomes are
organized, and therefore could be an interesting tool to dissect genomic
rearrangements.

data provide a detailed example of how covering such a broad range in
wavelength provides a powerful tool for constraining the physical properties of
stellar populations. The deepest data reach the ancient red clump at M_F814W
-0.2. All of the optical data reach the main sequence turnoff for stars younger
than ~300 Myr, and the blue He burning sequence for stars younger than 500 Myr.
The full CMD-fitting analysis shows that all three fields in our data set are
consistent with ~75% of the stellar mass being older than 8 Gyr, in spite of
showing a wide range in star formation rates at the present day. Thus, our
results suggest that the scale length of NGC 4214 has remained relatively
constant for many Gyr. As previously noted by others, we also find the galaxy
has recently ramped up production, consistent with its bright UV luminosity and
its population of UV-bright massive stars. In the central field we find UV
point sources with F336W magnitudes as bright as -9.9. These are as bright as
stars with masses of at least 52-56 M_sun and ages near 4 Myr in stellar
evolution models. Assuming a standard IMF, our CMD is well-fitted by an
increase in star formation rate beginning 100 Myr ago. The stellar populations
of this late-type dwarf are compared with those of NGC 404, an early-type dwarf

collective modes of the electron fluid in the metal are excited when light
strikes the surface of the nanostructure. These excitations, known as plasmons,
can have evanescent electromagnetic fields that are orders of magnitude larger
than the incident electromagnetic field. The largest field enhancements often
occur in nanogaps between plasmonically active nanostructures[3, 4], but it is
extremely challenging to measure the fields in such gaps directly. These
enhanced fields have applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopies[5-7],
nonlinear optics[1, 8-10], and nanophotonics[11-15]. Here we show that
nonlinear tunnelling conduction between gold electrodes separated by a
subnanometre gap leads to optical rectification, producing a DC photocurrent
when the gap is illuminated. Comparing this photocurrent with low frequency
conduction measurements, we determine the optical frequency voltage across the
tunnelling region of the nanogap, and also the enhancement of the electric
field in the tunnelling region, as a function of gap size. The measured field
enhancements exceed 1000, consistent with estimates from surface-enhanced Raman
measurements[16-18]. Our results highlight the need for more realistic
theoretical approaches that are able to model the electromagnetic response of
metal nanostructures on scales ranging from the free space wavelength,

It is widely believed that hard-scattered partons lose energy when propagating
through a medium before hadronizing. Partons losing enough energy may not even
make it out of the medium as identifiable jets (although the momentum will be
shared among whatever particles are emitted). ""Full"" jet reconstruction
attempts to determine the partonic energy loss as well as possible changes in
jet shape. Heavy ion collisions typically produce many unrelated particles

significant uncertainties. A variety of techniques using high-$p_t$ particles,
assumed to be leading particles from jet fragmentation, look for disappearance
of jets and attenuation of jets relative to the reaction plane, as well as
medium modifications such as Mach cones. Those techniques have considerable
uncertainty due to subtraction of $v_2$. In this paper we discuss minimum-bias
jets observed at RHIC using two-particle correlations. We find that jets
produced in p-p collisions have interesting properties. Peripheral A-A
collisions look like p-p collision. As we select more central collisions the
number of jets increases following binary collision scaling until at a
system-dependent centrality the number of particles associated with jets
increases substantially above this scaling. Near this transition centrality the
jet aspect ratio---elongated transverse to the beam direction for low-energy
jets produced in p-p collisions---becomes highly elongated along the beam

off, together with the observed variability on timescale of ~10 min challenges
standard emission models. If the emission originates in a portion of the
relativistic jet located inside the BLR, severe absorption of gamma rays above
few tens of GeV is expected due to the pair production process. These
observations imply the existence of a very compact (R_b ~5 x 10^{14} cm) and
very fast blob located far beyond the BLR radius, responsible for the rapidly
varying high energy flux. However the long term (days-weeks) coherent evolution
of the GeV flux recorded by LAT indicates that there could be also the
substantial contribution from another larger emission region. We model the
spectral energy distribution of PKS 1222+216 during the epoch of the MAGIC
detection assuming three different scenarios,: (1) a one-zone model considering
only the emission from a compact blob outside the BLR; (2) a two-zone model
considering the compact blob plus an emitting region filling the whole jet
cross-section located outside the BLR and (3) a two zone model with the jet
emitting region inside the BLR. We find that in all cases the high-energy
emission from the compact blob is dominated by the inverse Compton scattering
of the IR thermal radiation of the dusty torus. Both regions are matter
dominated, with a negligible Poynting flux. These results disfavor models in
which the compact blob is the result of reconnection events inside the jet or
""needles"" of high-energy electrons. Instead, the observational framework and
our radiative models could be compatible with scenarios in which the jet is

research has shown that externalities lead to serious problems for market
stability and for developing efficient algorithms to find stable matchings. In
this paper we make the observation that peer effects are often the result of
underlying social connections, and we explore a formulation of the many-to-one
matching market where peer effects are derived from an underlying social
network. The key feature of our model is that it captures peer effects and
complementarities using utility functions, rather than traditional preference
ordering. With this model and considering a weaker notion of stability, namely
two-sided exchange stability, we prove that stable matchings always exist and
characterize the set of stable matchings in terms of social welfare. We also
give distributed algorithms that are guaranteed to converge to a two-sided
exchange stable matching. To assess the competitive ratio of these algorithms
and to more generally characterize the efficiency of matching markets with
externalities, we provide general bounds on how far the welfare of the
worst-case stable matching can be from the welfare of the optimal matching, and
find that the structure of the social network (e.g. how well clustered the
network is) plays a large role.

upconverters fabricated with ionic liquids (ILs), which are novel fluids that
are recently drawing attention due to their unique properties, such as
negligible vapor pressures and high thermal stabilities. The upconverters in
this study are based on triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) between excited
polycyclic aromatic molecules, and TTA requires a fluidic media to allow for
the molecules to collide with each other for energy transfer. This process,
TTA-based photon upconversion (TTA-UC), was therefore mainly accomplished with
organic solvents previously. It is found that the molecules used for TTA-UC,
which are non-polar or weakly polar, are stably solvated in a certain class of
ILs. The mechanism of the observed solvation is proposed and discussed. The
upconversion quantum yields (UC-QYs) measured by continuous wave (CW) light
excitation reach as high as 10 % with moderate excitation intensity (~ 6
W/cm2), which is considerably higher than those in previous TTA-UC studies
performed with organic solvents (up to ~ 4 % with CW light excitations). It is
found that the value of UC-QY starts to saturate as the excitation power
increases for all the cases, even within the moderate CW excitation power range
in this study. An analytical model that describes the UC-QY vs. excitation
power relationship is derived and compared with the experimental results. The
agreement between them suggests that the donor-acceptor energy transfer in this
system is highly efficient. Based on these experimental and analytical
findings, it is found that efficient energy transfer between the molecules is
possible in ILs and therefore ILs are not actually viscous media for the
purpose of TTA-UC.

robust constraints for the model parameters. The work is presented in 2
sections. In the first, we test PiMC^2 using simulated SEDs to not only confirm
the recovery of the known inputs but to assess the limitations of the method
and identify potential hazards of SED fitting when applied specifically to high
redshift (z>4) galaxies. Our tests reveal five critical results: 1) the ability
to confidently constrain metallicity, population ages, and Av all require
photometric accuracy better than what is currently achievable (i.e. less than a
few percent); 2) the ability to confidently constrain stellar masses (within a
factor of two) can be achieved without the need for high-precision photometry;
3) the addition of IRAC photometry does not guarantee that tighter constraints
of the stellar masses and ages can be defined; 4) different assumptions about
the star formation history can lead to significant biases in mass and age
estimates; and 5) we are able to constrain stellar age and Av of objects that
are both young and relatively dust free. In the second part of the paper we
apply PiMC^2 to 17 4<z<8 objects, including the GRAPES Ly alpha sample (4<z<6),
supplemented by HST/WFC3 near-IR observations, and several broad band selected
z>6 galaxies. Using PiMC^2, we are able to constrain the stellar mass of these
objects and in some cases their stellar age and find no evidence that any of
these sources formed at a redshift much larger than z_f=8, a time when the

the phase of weak conditional probabilities directly with the action of a
unitary transform that maximizes the overlap of initial and final states. This

($\zeta=70-90^{\circ}$) have been preferentially detected by the $Fermi$
$\gamma$-ray telescope, and hence the observed pulse profiles of the

the simulation, most $\gamma$-ray millisecond pulsars are categorized as the
radio-quiet $\gamma$-ray pulsars, because its radio fluxes are under the
sensitivities of the major radio surveys. Even we drastically increase the
radio sensitivity by a factor of ten, the number of radio-selected millisecond
pulsars detected by the $Fermi$ ten years observations is still much less than
the expected $\gamma$-ray-selected millisecond pulsars, indicating the
radio-quiet millisecond pulsars must contribute to the $Fermi$ unidentified
sources and/or the $\gamma$-ray background radiations. The Unique radiation
properties of the low-efficient $\gamma$-ray pulsar, PSR J0659+1414, can be
explained by the present our gap model with a viewing geometry of $\alpha\sim

increase in luminosity as they evolve. In addition to this, evidence for an
increase in velocity range with evolution is presented. This implies that it is
not only the luminosity, but also the volume of gas conducive to the different
maser transitions, that increases as the sources evolve. Comparison with
GLIMPSE mid-infrared sources has revealed a coincidence rate between the
locations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers and GLIMPSE point sources similar to
that achieved in previous studies. Overall, the properties of the GLIMPSE
sources with and without 12.2 GHz counterparts are similar. There is a higher

IceCube neutrino telescope. For the first time, a search is performed over the
entire parameter space of energy, direction and time looking for neutrino
flares of 20 microseconds to a year duration from astrophysical sources among
the atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds. Searches which integrate over
time are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a larger
background of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the time
constraint. Flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei,
soft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrino
emitters. We used mainly data taken between April 5, 2008 and May 20, 2009 by a
partially completed configuration of IceCube with 40 strings. For the presented
searches an unbinned maximum likelihood method is used with a time-dependent
prior to test several different source hypotheses. An ""untriggered"" search
covers any possible time-dependent emission from sources not correlated to any
other observation using other astrophysical messengers such as photons.
Moreover, a similar time scan is performed for a predefined catalogue of
sources that exhibit intense photon flares. Searches triggered by
multi-wavelength information on flares from blazars and soft gamma-ray
repeaters are performed using the 40 string data and also the data taken by the
previous configuration of 22 strings in operation between May 31, 2007 and
April 5, 2008. Flares for which extensive and continuous monitoring is
available from Fermi-LAT and SWIFT and flares detected by imaging Cherenkov
telescopes with shorter time-scale monitoring are considered. The results from
all searches are compatible with a fluctuation of the background.

has difficulties in explaining the large rapidity dependent asymmetry and mass
dependent asymmetry simultaneously and the parameter space relevant to
$A^t_{FB}$ is ruled out by the latest dijet search at ATLAS. In contrast to
Ref. \cite{cp}, we demonstrate that the large parameter space in this model
with a $U(1)_d$ flavor symemtry is not ruled out by flavor physics. The
$t$-channel flavor-violating $Z^{\prime}$ \cite{hitoshi},
$W^{\prime}$\cite{waiyee} and diquark \cite{tim} models all have parameter
regions that satisfy different $A_{FB}$ measurements within 1 $\sigma$.
However, the heavy $Z^{\prime}$ model which can be marginally consistent with
the total cross section is severely constrained by the Tevatron direct search
of same-sign top quark pair. The diquark model suffers from too large total
cross section and is difficult to fit the $t \bar{t}$ invariant mass
distribution. The electroweak precision constraints on the $W'$ model based on
$Z'$-$Z$ mixings is estimated and the result is rather weak ($m_{Z'} > 450$
GeV). Therefore, the heavy $W^{\prime}$ model seems to give the best fit for
all the measurements. The $W^{\prime}$ model predicts the $t\bar{t}+j$ signal
from $tW^{\prime}$ production and is 10%-50% of SM $t\bar{t}$ at the 7 TeV LHC.
Such $t+j$ resonance can serve as the direct test of the $W^{\prime}$ model.

for digital information hiding and copyright protection. Many DWT-based
algorithms for this aim are proposed. The performance of these algorithms is in
term of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) which are used to
measure the quality and the robustness of an embedded audio. However, there is
a tradeoff relationship between the embedded-audio quality and robustness. The
tradeoff relationship is a signal processing problem in the wavelet domain. To
solve this problem, this study presents an optimization-based scaling scheme
using optimal multi-coefficients quantization in the wavelet domain. Firstly,
the multi-coefficients quantization technique is rewritten as an equation with
arbitrary scaling on DWT coefficients and set SNR to be a performance index.
Then, a functional connecting the equation and the performance index is
derived. Secondly, Lagrange Principle is used to obtain the optimal solution.
Thirdly, the scaling factors of the DWT coefficients are also optimized.
Moreover, the invariant feature of these optimized scaling factors is used to
resist the amplitude scaling. Experimental results show that the embedded audio

objects in X-ray binaries, there is as yet no standard model for their
underlying physics. The origin of the observed disk-jet coupling also remains
largely unknown. X-ray variability studies have revealed complex variability in
the accretion flow onto stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, on
timescales as short as milliseconds. The detection of correlated broad-band
rapid time variability in the jet emission would provide valuable information
on how the variability is transferred along the jet and on the timescales of
physical processes operating in these jets, ultimately helping to constrain
internal jet physics, probe disk-jet coupling and infer accretion geometry. In
recent years there have been indirect evidences for optical fast variability
arising from a powerful jet. However, in optical light the emission from the
outer disk can strongly contaminate the jet signal, resulting in an ambiguous
identification of the source of the variability. On the other hand, at much
longer wavelengths the variability, coming from far out in the jet, will be
smeared out in time. Infrared variability studies are thus ideal for looking at
jet variability on the fastest possible timescales. Thanks to newly available
detectors and fast-readout modes, fast infrared and mid-infrared photometry is
now possible. This is opening a new exciting window to study the geometry and
the Physics of relativistic jets and their connection with the accretion flow.
Here we present the first results from a large ongoing fast-timing
multi-wavelength project, showing the first unambiguous evidence for sub-second
jet variable emission. We show how this type of data already allows us to put
quantitative constraints to the jet speed, geometry and physics, and discuss
the great potential of new observations in the near future.

dipoles being polarized along the z axis to a series of ground states
characterized by distinct mean total angular momentum, and finally to an
anisotropic integer quantum Hall state. During the transition from the
fractional regime to the integer regime, we find that the density profile of

doubly-occupied site (doublon, D) and an empty site (holon, H), like a
long-range type as well as a conventional nearest-neighbor type, and add
independent long-range D-D (H-H) factors. It is found that a wide choice of D-H
binding factor leads to Mott transitions at critical values near the band
width. We renew the D-H binding picture of Mott transitions by introducing two
characteristic length scales, the D-H binding length l_{DH} and the minimum D-D
distance l_{DD}, which we appropriately estimate. A Mott transition takes place
at l_{DH}=l_{DD}. In the metallic regime (l_{DH}>l_{DD}), the domains of D-H
pairs overlap with one another, thereby doublons and holons can move
independently by exchanging the partners one after another. In contrast, the
D-D factors give only a minor contribution to the Mott transition.

  Access",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NI math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental problem of multiple secondary users contending for
opportunistic spectrum access over multiple channels in cognitive radio
networks has been formulated recently as a decentralized multi-armed bandit
(D-MAB) problem. In a D-MAB problem there are $M$ users and $N$ arms (channels)
that each offer i.i.d. stochastic rewards with unknown means so long as they
are accessed without collision. The goal is to design a decentralized online
learning policy that incurs minimal regret, defined as the difference between
the total expected rewards accumulated by a model-aware genie, and that
obtained by all users applying the policy. We make two contributions in this
paper. First, we consider the setting where the users have a prioritized
ranking, such that it is desired for the $K$-th-ranked user to learn to access
the arm offering the $K$-th highest mean reward. For this problem, we present
the first distributed policy that yields regret that is uniformly logarithmic
over time without requiring any prior assumption about the mean rewards.
Second, we consider the case when a fair access policy is required, i.e., it is
desired for all users to experience the same mean reward. For this problem, we
present a distributed policy that yields order-optimal regret scaling with
respect to the number of users and arms, better than previously proposed
policies in the literature. Both of our distributed policies make use of an
innovative modification of the well known UCB1 policy for the classic
multi-armed bandit problem that allows a single user to learn how to play the
arm that yields the $K$-th largest mean reward.

to be considered and individually give rise to truncated Levy random walks as
shown in the paper. The nonlinear Langevin equation governing the particle
motion was solved numerically using an order 1.5 strong stochastic Runge-Kutta
method and the obtained numerical data were employed to calculate the geometric
mean of the particle displacement during a certain time interval and to
construct its distribution function. It is demonstrated that the time
dependence of the geometric mean comprises three fragments following one
another as the time scale increases that can be categorized as the ballistic
regime, the Levy type regime (superballistic, quasiballistic, or superdiffusive
one), and the standard motion of Brownian particles. For the intermediate Levy
type part the distribution of the particle displacement is found to be of the
generalized Cauchy form with cutoff. Besides, the properties of the random
walks at hand are shown to be determined mainly by a certain ratio of the
friction coefficient and the noise intensity rather then their characteristics

promising avenue. However, it is crucial to understand what type of relaying
schemes should be used for achieving different performance objectives under
realistic fading conditions. In this paper, we present a general framework for
modelling and evaluating the performance of relaying schemes based on the
decode-and-forward (DF) protocol over independent and not necessarily
identically distributed (INID) Nakagami-m fading channels. In particular, we
present closed-form expressions for the statistics of the instantaneous output
signal-to-noise ratio of four significant relaying schemes with DF; two based
on repetitive transmission and the other two based on relay selection (RS).
These expressions are then used to obtain closed-form expressions for the
outage probability and the average symbol error probability for several
modulations of all considered relaying schemes over INID Nakagami-m fading.
Importantly, it is shown that when the channel state information for RS is
perfect, RS-based transmission schemes always outperform repetitive ones.
Furthermore, when the direct link between the source and the destination nodes
is sufficiently strong, relaying may not result in any gains and in this case
it should be switched-off.

class projection kernels given by spectral projections of selfadjoint
Sturm-Liouville operators. Instead of studying the convergence of the kernels
as functions, the method directly addresses the strong convergence of the
induced integral operators. We show that, for this notion of convergence, the
Dyson, Airy, and Bessel kernels are universal in the bulk, soft-edge, and
hard-edge scaling limits. This result allows us to give a short and unified
derivation of the known formulae for the scaling limits of the classical random
matrix ensembles with unitary invariance, that is, the Gaussian unitary
ensemble (GUE), the Wishart or Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE), and the MANOVA

TeV) gamma-rays in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy in 2006 by
the HESS collaboration, the correlation of this emission with the integrated
intensity of the CS(1-0) molecular line emission has inferred a hadronic origin
for the gamma-rays. Here we describe the beginning of our investigation into
the strength of this correlation utilising new multi-line millimeter data from
the Mopra CMZ and HOP surveys and multi-wavelength GBT radio continuum
observations towards the CMZ and compare these in detail with the diffuse TeV
gamma-ray emission from HESS. The benefit of these new data is that they allow
us to simultaneously observe and analyse correlations using a large number
(>10) of molecular species, some of which contain their isotopologue pairs. The
use of isotopologue pairs is especially powerful, since it allows one to
analyse the optical depth of a number of different molecular species, thus
investigating the nature of the correlation over a range of different physical
conditions. Here we begin by comparing the integrated line emission and
continuum radio emission with the diffuse gamma-ray emission, and, by using
isotopologue pairs such as HCN/H$^{13}$CN, obtain optical depths throughout the
CMZ corresponding to regions of both strong and weak gamma-ray emission. We
find that the radio continuum better matches the peak of the gamma-ray
emission, which corresponds to the more compact -- compared to the relatively
coarse resolution of the gamma-ray images -- sources in the CMZ. Using the
isotopologue pairs, we find that the optical depth at all positions and
velocities within the CMZ are about 2--4. This is similar to that found for the
CS(1--0) line and would underestimate the mass of the CMZ, potentially
explaining why molecular line emission peaks appear offset from the gamma-ray
peaks.

clusters characterized by an isothermal temperature profile and a central
entropy floor, and cool-core clusters where temperature and entropy in the
central region are increasing with radius. Using cosmological resimulations of
a galaxy cluster, we study the evolution of its intracluster medium (ICM) gas
properties, and through them we assess the effect of different (sub-grid)
modelling of the physical processes at play, namely gas cooling, star
formation, feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN). More
specifically we show that AGN feedback plays a major role in the pre-heating of
the proto-cluster as it prevents a high concentration of mass from collecting
in the center of the future galaxy cluster at early times. However, AGN
activity during the cluster's later evolution is also required to regulate the
mass flow into its core and prevent runaway star formation in the central
galaxy. Whereas the energy deposited by supernovae alone is insufficient to
prevent an overcooling catastrophe, supernovae are responsible for spreading a
large amount of metals at high redshift, enhancing the cooling efficiency of
the ICM gas. As the AGN energy release depends on the accretion rate of gas
onto its central black hole engine, the AGN responds to this supernova enhanced
gas accretion by injecting more energy into the surrounding gas, and as a
result increases the amount of early pre-heating. We demonstrate that the
interaction between an AGN jet and the ICM gas that regulates the growth of the
AGN's BH, can naturally produce cool core clusters if we neglect metals.
However, as soon as metals are allowed to contribute to the radiative cooling,
only the non cool core solution is produced.

perturbation theory taking into account ion motion. At given density the crust
is modelled as a body-centered cubic Coulomb crystal of fully ionized atomic
nuclei of one type with the uniform charge-compensating electron background.
Classic and quantum regimes of ion motion are considered. The calculations in
the classic temperature range agree well with previous Monte Carlo simulations.
At these temperatures the shear modulus is given by the sum of a positive
contribution due to the static lattice and a negative $\propto T$ contribution
due to the ion motion. The quantum calculations are performed for the first
time. The main result is that at low temperatures the contribution to the shear
modulus due to the ion motion saturates at a constant value, associated with
zero-point ion vibrations. Such behavior is qualitatively similar to the
zero-point ion motion contribution to the crystal energy. The quantum effects
may be important for lighter elements at higher densities, where the ion plasma
temperature is not entirely negligible compared to the typical Coulomb ion
interaction energy. The results of numerical calculations are approximated by
convenient fitting formulae. They should be used for precise neutron star
oscillation modelling, a rapidly developing branch of stellar seismology.

respectively. For the SP it was 2.5. times more likely that a region was not a
breeding ground after a renourishment event. Through a maximum entropy
principle model we observed small differences in the habitat use of the SP
during the breeding and the wintering season. However the habitats where RK was
observed ap- peared quite different. Maintaining and creating optimal suitable
habitats for SP characterized by sparse low vegetation in the foredunes areas,
and uneven/low-slope beach surfaces, is the proposed conservation scenario to
convert anthropic beach restorations and SP populations into a positive
feedback without impacting other threatened shorebird species.

$\cE_n$-tangent complex and $\cE_n$-Hochschild cohomology of an $\cE_n$-ring
$A$. We give two proofs: The first is direct, reducing the problem to certain
stable splittings of configuration spaces of punctured Euclidean spaces; the
second is more conceptual, where we identify the sequence as the Lie algebras
of a fiber sequence of derived algebraic groups, $B^{n-1}A^\times\ra \Aut_A\ra
\Aut_{\fB^nA}$. Here $\fB^nA$ is an enriched $(\oo,n)$-category constructed
from $A$, and $\cE_n$-Hochschild cohomology is realized as the infinitesimal
automorphisms of $\fB^nA$. These groups are associated to moduli problems in
$\cE_{n+1}$-geometry, a {\it less} commutative form of derived algebraic
geometry, in the sense of To\""en-Vezzosi and Lurie. Applying techniques of
Koszul duality, this sequence consequently attains a nonunital
$\cE_{n+1}$-algebra structure; in particular, the shifted tangent complex
$T_A[-n]$ is a nonunital $\cE_{n+1}$-algebra. The $\cE_{n+1}$-algebra structure
of this sequence extends the previously known $\cE_{n+1}$-algebra structure on
$\hh^*_{\cE_{n}}(A)$, given in the higher Deligne conjecture. In order to
establish this moduli-theoretic interpretation, we make extensive use of
factorization homology, a homology theory for framed $n$-manifolds with
coefficients given by $\cE_n$-algebras, constructed as a topological analogue
of Beilinson-Drinfeld's chiral homology. We give a separate exposition of this
theory, developing the necessary results used in our proofs. This work is an

controlled by suitably tuning the strength of laser and cavity coupling, the
angle between laser and cavity axis, and the array periodicity. We characterize
the coherence properties of the light when the system can either operate as
degenerate parametric amplifier or as a source of antibunched-light. Our study
permits us to identify the individual multi-photon components of the nonlinear

classical T Tauri stars. Molecular emission from rotational transitions of H2O
and OH and ro-vibrational bands of simple organic molecules (CO2, HCN, C2H2) is
common among the sources in the sample. The gas temperatures (200-800 K) and
emitting areas we derive are consistent with the emission originating in a warm
disk atmosphere in the inner planet formation region at radii < 2 AU. The H2O
emission appears to form under a limited range of excitation conditions, as
shown by the similarity in relative strengths of H2O features from star to star
and the narrow range in derived temperature and column density. Emission from
highly excited rotational levels of OH is present in all stars; the OH emission
flux increases with the stellar accretion rate, and the OH/H2O flux ratio shows
a relatively small scatter. We interpret these results as evidence for OH
production via FUV photo-dissociation of H2O in the disk surface layers. No
obvious explanation is found for the observed range in the relative emission
strengths of different organic molecules or in their strength with respect to
water. We put forward the possibility that these variations reflect a diversity
in organic abundances due to star-to-star differences in the C/O ratio of the
inner disk gas. Stars with the largest HCN/H2O flux ratios in our sample have
the largest disk masses. We speculate that such a trend could result if higher
mass disks are more efficient at planetesimal formation and sequestration of
water in the outer disk, leading to enhanced C/O ratios and abundances of
organic molecules in the inner disk. A comparison of our derived HCN to H2O
column density ratio to comets, hot cores, and outer T Tauri star disks
suggests that the inner disks are chemically active.

mathematical objects, but are also of great importance in an applied
computational context. Indeed, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), a wide
class of algorithmic problems that occur in many different areas of computer
science such as artificial intelligence or database theory, may be viewed as
asking for homomorphisms between two relational structures [FedVar98]. In a
logical setting, homomorphisms may be viewed as witnesses for positive
primitive formulas in a relational language. As we shall see, homomorphisms, or
more precisely the numbers of homomorphisms between two structures, are also
related to a fundamental computational problem of statistical physics.
  In this article, we are concerned with the complexity of counting
homomorphisms from a given structure A to a fixed structure B. Actually, we are
mainly interested in a generalization of this problem to weighted homomorphisms
(or partition functions). We almost exclusively focus on graphs. The first part

over short timescales can systematically reduce cultural heterogeneity in the
long run, and whether offline and online human interactions contribute
differently to the process. Theoretical models suggest that short-term
collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity are mutually excluding,
since they require very different levels of social influence. The latter
jointly depends on two factors: the topology of the underlying social network
and the overlap between individuals in multidimensional cultural space.
However, while the empirical properties of social networks are well understood,
little is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in
cultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used in
models. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional analysis of
the scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find that inter-opinion
correlations determine a nontrivial ultrametric hierarchy of individuals in
cultural space, a result unaccessible to one-dimensional analyses and in
striking contrast with random assumptions. When empirical data are used as
inputs in models, we find that ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive
effects, especially in the extreme case of long-range online-like interactions
bypassing social ties. On short time-scales, it strongly facilitates a
symmetry-breaking phase transition triggering coordinated social behavior. On
long time-scales, it severely suppresses cultural convergence by restricting it
within disjoint groups. We therefore find that, remarkably, the empirical
distribution of individuals in cultural space appears to optimize the
coexistence of short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity,
which can be realized simultaneously for the same moderate level of mutual
influence.

Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, the Korn-Sobolev inequality and
Hodge-Sobolev estimates for differential forms due to J. Bourgain and H.
Brezis. In the proof, the class of cocanceling homogeneous linear differential
operator (L(D)) of order (k) on (\mathbb{R}^n) from a vector space (E) to a
vector space (F) is introduced. It is proved that (L(D)) is cocanceling if and
only if for every (f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n; E)) such that (L(D)f=0), one has (f
\in \dot{W}^{-1, n/(n-1)}(\mathbb{R}^n; E)). The results extend to fractional
and Lorentz spaces and can be strengthened using some tools of J. Bourgain and
H. Brezis.

The relative performance of two different automatically generated

$\Delta C/T = \gamma_0 - T^{1/2}$ with $\gamma_0$ of order 700 mJ/mole-K$^2$.
The resistivity behaves as $\rho = \rho_0 + AT^{3/2}$ for temperatures below 2

with the SCR theory of Moriya and Takimoto\cite{Moriya}. The inelastic neutron

independent of $Q$; we interpret this as Kondo scattering with $T_K =$ 17 K. In
addition, the scattering is enhanced near $Q$=(1/2, 1/2, 0) with maximum
scattering at $\Delta E$ = 0.45 meV; we interpret this as scattering from
antiferromagnetic fluctuations near the antiferromagnetic QCP.

supernova remnant IC443 and accurately established its radio continuum spectral
properties. We used the VLA in multiple configurations to produce high
resolution radio images of IC443 at 74 and 330 MHz. The changes with position
in the radio spectral index were correlated with data in near infrared from
2MASS, in gamma-rays from VERITAS, and with the molecular 12^CO line emission.
The new image at 74 MHz has HPBW=35"", rms=30 mJy/beam and at 330 MHz HPBW= 17""
and rms=1.7 mJy/beam. The integrated flux densities for the whole SNR are
S_74MHz=470+/-51 Jy and S_330MHz=248+/-15 Jy. For the pulsar wind nebula
associated with the compact source CXOUJ061705.3+222127, we calculated
S_330MHz=0.23+/-0.05 Jy, S_1420MHz=0.20+/-0.04 Jy, and alpha~0.0. Substantial
variations are observed in spectral index between 74 and 330 MHz across IC443.
The flattest spectral components (-0.25< alpha<-0.05) coincide with the
brightest parts of the SNR along the eastern border, with an impressive
agreement with ionic lines as observed in the 2MASS J and H bands. This result
strongly suggests that the passage of a fast dissociating J-type shock across
the interacting molecular cloud dissociated the molecules and ionized the gas.
We therefore conclude that thermal absorption at 74 MHz is responsible for the
localized spectral index flattening observed along the eastern border of IC443.
The diffuse interior of IC443 has a spectrum steeper than found anywhere in the
SNR (-0.85<alpha<-0.6), while the southern ridge again has a flatter spectrum
(alpha -0.4), consequence in this case of the strong shock/molecular cloud
interaction. At the available statistics the VERITAS gamma-ray emission
strikingly matches the CO distribution, but no clear evidence is found for a
morphological correlation between the TeV distribution and radio emission.

within a periodic computational box and concentrate on flows that are
sub-Alfvenic on the cylindrical jet's axis. Displacement of the initial
force-free helical magnetic field leads to the growth of CD kink instability.
We find that helically distorted density structure propagates along the jet
with speed and flow structure dependent on the radius of the velocity shear
surface relative to the characteristic radius of the helically twisted
force-free magnetic field. At small velocity shear surface radius the plasma
flows through the kink with minimal kink propagation speed. The kink
propagation speed increases as the velocity shear radius increases and the kink
becomes more embedded in the plasma flow. A decreasing magnetic pitch profile
and faster flow enhance the influence of velocity shear. Simulations show
continuous transverse growth in the nonlinear phase of the instability. The
growth rate of the CD kink instability and the nonlinear behavior also depend
on the velocity shear surface radius and flow speed, and the magnetic pitch
radial profile. Larger velocity shear radius leads to slower linear growth,
makes a later transition to the nonlinear stage, and with larger maximum
amplitude than occur for a static plasma column. However, when the velocity
shear radius is much greater than the characteristic radius of the helical
magnetic field, linear and non-linear development can be similar to the
development of a static plasma column.
