dynamics simulations. Dependence of the barrier height on the polymer length,
the driving field strength, and the channel entrance geometry is investigated.
Squeezing effect of the electric field on the polymer before its entry to the

polymer prior to its entry changes the polymer length dependence of the barrier
height noticeably. Our theory and simulation results are in good agreement and
reasonably describe related experimental data.

photonic crystals (PhCs) built as arrays of alternating linear and nonlinear
stripes, in the case when maxima of the effective refractive index coincide
with minima of the self-focusing coefficient, and vice versa, i.e.,the
corresponding linear and nonlinear periodic potentials are in competition. This
setting may be induced, as a virtual PhC, by means of the EIT
(electromagnetically-induced-transparency) technique, in a uniform optical
medium. It may also be realized as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to
the action of combined periodic optical potential and periodically modulated
Feshbach resonance. The first SSB happens at the center of a linear stripe,
pushing a broad low-power soliton into an adjacent nonlinear stripe and
gradually suppressing side peaks in the soliton's shape. Then, the soliton
restores its symmetry, being pinned to the midpoint of the nonlinear stripe.
The second SSB occurs at higher powers, pushing the narrow soliton off the
center of the nonlinear channel,while the soliton keeps its internal symmetry.
The results are obtained by means of numerical and analytical methods. They may
be employed to control switching of light beams by means of the varying power.

bulge of this galaxy is a disk-like pseudobulge, which has the S{\'e}rsic index
close to the exponential law, rich gas, and a young circumnuclear ring

radial age and metallicity gradients. The inner region is older and has a much
steeper age gradient than the outer region of the disk. Both these two regions
and the central young structure can be seen in the radial profile of the
optical color. Based on the age and reddening distributions, we consider that
the pseudobulge and disk are likely to have grown via the secular evolution,
which is the redistribution of mass and energy through the angular momentum
transport caused by the non-axisymmetric potential of the spirals. However,
possible gas accretion events could affect the outer region of the disk, due to
abundant H{\sc i} gas accumulating in the outer disk.

unfolding reveal details about a few degrees of freedom of a complex system.
Molecular dynamics simulations can provide complementary information, but
exploration of the space of possible configurations is often hindered by large
barriers in phase space that separate metastable regions. To solve this
problem, enhanced sampling methods have been developed that divide a phase
space into regions and integrate trajectory segments in each region. These
methods boost the probability of passage over barriers, and facilitate
parallelization since integration of the trajectory segments does not require
communication, aside from their initialization and termination. Here we present
a parallel version of an enhanced sampling method suitable for systems driven
far from equilibrium: nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS). We apply this
method to a coarse-grained model of a 262-nucleotide RNA molecule that unfolds
and refolds in an explicit flow field modeled with stochastic rotation
dynamics. Using NEUS we are able to observe extremely rare unfolding events
that have mean first passage times as long as 1.4 s (3.4 E13 dynamics steps).
We examine the unfolding process for a range of flow rates of the medium, and
we describe two competing pathways in which different intramolecular contacts
are broken.

with occasional broadband (Johnson V) photometry. The acquired spectroscopy
allowed a detailed study of spectral variability on timescales from \sim 5
minutes to months. Results. We find that all observed spectral lines of a given
chemical element tend to show similar variations and that there is a good
correlation between the lines of different elements, without any significant
time delays, save the strong absorption components of the Hei lines, which tend
to vary differently from the emission parts. We find a single sustained
periodicity, P \sim 9.8 h, which is likely related to the relatively stable
pulsations found in MOST photometry obtained one year later. In addition,
seemingly stochastic, large-amplitude variations are also seen in all spectral
lines on timescales of several hours to several days.

""densely connected clusters"" as imperfect cliques, where imperfections
correspond missing edges, which are relatively sparse. We analyze the problem

astrophysical neutrinos with IceCube is the search for a diffuse flux of
high-energy neutrinos from unresolved sources. A hard energy spectrum of
neutrinos from isotropically distributed astrophysical sources could manifest
itself as a detectable signal that may be differentiated from the atmospheric
neutrino background by spectral measurement. This analysis uses data from the
IceCube detector collected in its half completed configuration which operated
between April 2008 and May 2009 to search for a diffuse flux of astrophysical
muon neutrinos. A total of 12,877 upward going candidate neutrino events have
been selected for this analysis. No evidence for a diffuse flux of
astrophysical muon neutrinos was found in the data set leading to a 90 percent
C.L. upper limit on the normalization of an $E^{-2}$ astrophysical $\nu_{\mu}$
flux of $8.9 \times 10^{-9} \ \mathrm{GeV \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1} \ sr^{-1}}$. The
analysis is sensitive in the energy range between $35 \ \mathrm{TeV} - 7 \

atmospheric muon neutrinos measured from 332 GeV to 84 TeV and no evidence for
a prompt component to the atmospheric neutrino spectrum is found.

mediates a non-linear competition between the preference for bundle twist and
the size-dependent mechanical cost of filament bending, which in turn gives
rise to feedback between the global twist of self-assembled bundles and their
lateral size. Finally, we demonstrate that above a critical density of bound

modeling. Previously methods based on the modified rate equation, the master
equation, the moment equation, and Monte Carlo simulations have been used.
[Aims] We attempt to develop a systematic and efficient way to model the
gas-grain chemistry with a large reaction network as accurately as possible.
[Methods] We present a hybrid moment equation approach which is a general and
automatic method where the generating function is used to generate the moment
equations. For large reaction networks, the moment equation is cut off at the
second order, and a switch scheme is used when the average population of
certain species reaches 1. For small networks, the third order moments can also
be utilized to achieve a higher accuracy. [Results] For physical conditions in
which the surface reactions are important, our method provides a major
improvement over the rate equation approach, when benchmarked against the
rigorous Monte Carlo results. For either very low or very high temperatures, or
large grain radii, results from the rate equation are similar to those from our
new approach. Our method is faster than the Monte Carlo approach, but slower
than the rate equation approach. [Conclusions] The hybrid moment equation
approach with a cutoff and switch scheme is applicable to large gas-grain
networks, and is accurate enough to be used for astrochemistry studies. The
layered structure of the grain mantle could also be incorporated into this
approach, although a full implementation of the grain micro-physics appears to
be difficult.

measurement of the dephasing rate at different bias points provides a way to
extract both the amplitude and the sign of the noise correlations. We find that

voting, applicable in the case of the Council of Ministers of the European
Union (EU), is investigated. Various arguments in favour of the square root
voting system, where the voting weights of member states are proportional to
the square root of their population are discussed and a link between this
solution and the random walk in the one-dimensional lattice is established. It
is known that the voting power of every member state is approximately equal to
its voting weight, if the threshold q for the qualified majority in the voting
body is optimally chosen. We analyze the square root voting system for a
generic 'union' of M states and derive in this case an explicit approximate
formula for the level of the optimal threshold: q \simeq 1/2+1/\sqrt{{\pi} M}.
The prefactor 1/\sqrt{{\pi}} appears here as a result of averaging over the
ensemble of unions with random populations.

supports approximate point-to-point shortest-path-distance queries. The most
relevant measures for a distance-oracle construction are: space, query time,
and preprocessing time. There are strong distance-oracle constructions known
for planar graphs (Thorup, JACM'04) and, subsequently, minor-excluded graphs
(Abraham and Gavoille, PODC'06). However, these require Omega(eps^{-1} n lg n)
space for n-node graphs. We argue that a very low space requirement is
essential. Since modern computer architectures involve hierarchical memory
(caches, primary memory, secondary memory), a high memory requirement in effect
may greatly increase the actual running time. Moreover, we would like data
structures that can be deployed on small mobile devices, such as handhelds,
which have relatively small primary memory. In this paper, for planar graphs,
bounded-genus graphs, and minor-excluded graphs we give distance-oracle
constructions that require only O(n) space. The big O hides only a fixed
constant, independent of \epsilon and independent of genus or size of an
excluded minor. The preprocessing times for our distance oracle are also faster
than those for the previously known constructions. For planar graphs, the
preprocessing time is O(n lg^2 n). However, our constructions have slower query
times. For planar graphs, the query time is O(eps^{-2} lg^2 n). For our
linear-space results, we can in fact ensure, for any delta > 0, that the space
required is only 1 + delta times the space required just to represent the graph
itself.

were used to graph length-weight curves for six different species: channel

Bister et al. 2000). Parameters noted as doubtful by FishBase were excluded.
For each species, variations in curves were noted, and the minimum and maximum

were made between the parameters and study details reported in FishBase.org for
6 of 8 length-weight relationships and those reported in the reference
(Carlander 1969) for those 6 relationships. In all species studied, minimum and
maximum curves produced with the length-weight parameters at FishBase.org are
notably different from each other, and in many cases predict weights that are
clearly absurd. For example, one set of parameters predicts a 30 cm rainbow
trout weighing 44 g. For 30 cm length, the range of weights (relative to the

computed the algebra structure of the loop homology of spheres and complex

abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), a model of molecular algorithmic
self-assembly. In the ""hierarchical"" aTAM, two assemblies, both consisting of
multiple tiles, are allowed to aggregate together, whereas in the ""seeded""
aTAM, tiles attach one at a time to a growing assembly. Adleman, Cheng, Goel,
and Huang (""Running Time and Program Size for Self-Assembled Squares"", STOC
2001) showed how to assemble an n x n square in O(n) time in the seeded aTAM
using O(log n / log log n) unique tile types, where both of these parameters
are optimal. They asked whether the hierarchical aTAM could allow a tile system
to use the ability to form large assemblies in parallel before they attach to
break the Omega(n) lower bound for assembly time. We show that there is a tile
system with the optimal O(log n / log log n) tile types that assembles an n x n
square using O(log^2 n) parallel ""stages"", which is close to the optimal
Omega(log n) stages, forming the final n x n square from four n/2 x n/2
squares, which are themselves recursively formed from n/4 x n/4 squares, etc.
However, despite this nearly maximal parallelism, the system requires
superlinear time to assemble the square. We extend the definition of *partial
order tile systems* studied by Adleman et al. in a natural way to hierarchical
assembly and show that no hierarchical partial order tile system can build any
shape with diameter N in less than time Omega(N), demonstrating that in this
case the hierarchical model affords no speedup whatsoever over the seeded
model. We strengthen the Omega(N) time lower bound for deterministic seeded
systems of Adleman et al. to nondeterministic seeded systems. Finally, we show
that for infinitely many n, a tile system can assemble an n x n' rectangle,
with n > n', in time O(n^{4/5} log n), breaking the linear-time lower bound.

Thermal State, signified by an increasingly dominant thermal component
associated with the accretion disk, although this state change did not complete
before Swift observations ended. We observe an anti-correlation between the
increasing temperature and decreasing radius of the inner edge of the accretion
disk, suggesting that the inner edge of the accretion disk in-falls towards the
black-hole as the disk temperature increases. We observed significant evolution
in the absorption column during the initial rise of the outburst, with the
absorption almost doubling, suggestive of the presence of an evolving wind from
the accretion disk. We detect quasi- periodic oscillations that evolve with the

very nearby, very cold cloud in the interstellar medium. Through stellar
absorption studies we find that the LLCC is between 11.3 pc and 24.3 pc away,
making it the closest known cold neutral medium cloud and well within the
boundaries of the local cavity. Observations of the cloud in the 21-cm HI line
reveal that the LLCC is very cold, with temperatures ranging from 15 K to 30 K,
and is best fit with a model composed of two colliding components. The cloud
has associated 100 micron thermal dust emission, pointing to a somewhat low
dust-to-gas ratio of 48 x 10^-22 MJy sr^-1 cm^2. We find that the LLCC is too
far away to be generated by the collision among the nearby complex of local
interstellar clouds, but that the small relative velocities indicate that the
LLCC is somehow related to these clouds. We use the LLCC to conduct a shadowing
experiment in 1/4 keV X-rays, allowing us to differentiate between different
possible origins for the observed soft X-ray background. We find that a local
hot bubble model alone cannot account for the low-latitude soft X-ray
background, but that isotropic emission from solar wind charge exchange does
reproduce our data. In a combined local hot bubble and solar wind charge
exchange scenario, we rule out emission from a local hot bubble with an 1/4 keV
emissivity greater than 1.1 Snowdens / pc at 3 sigma, 4 times lower than
previous estimates. This result dramatically changes our perspective on our
local interstellar medium.

correlation function of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the photometric catalog

sample compromise ~ 1.5 x 10^6 LRGs distributed in 0.45 < z < 0.65, with a
characteristic photometric error of ~ 0.05. Our measured correlation centered
at z=0.55 is in very good agreement with predictions from standard LCDM in a
broad range of angular scales, $0.5^\circ < \theta < 6^\circ$. We find that the
growth of structure can indeed be robustly measured, with errors matching
expectations. The velocity growth rate is recovered as $f \sigma_8 = 0.53 \pm
0.42$ when no prior is imposed on the growth factor and the background geometry
follows a LCDM model with WMAP7+SNIa priors. This is compatible with the
corresponding General Relativity (GR) prediction $f \sigma_8 = 0.45$ for our
fiducial cosmology. If we adopt a parametrization such that $f=\Omega
^\gamma_m(z)$, with $\gamma \approx 0.55$ in GR, and combine our $f\sigma_8$
measurement with the corresponding ones from spectroscopic LRGs at lower

the presence of the baryon acoustic feature matching the amplitude, location

spectrum. Our analysis is based on the exact Veneziano--Yankielowicz-type
superpotential and on the strong-coupling spectrum of the theory found from the
mirror representation at small masses, |m_l| << \Lambda . We show that at weak
coupling the spectrum, with necessity, must include N-1 BPS towers of states,
instead of just one, as was thought before. Only one of the towers is seen in
the quasiclassical limit. We find the corresponding CMS for these towers, and
argue that in the large-N limit they become circles, filling out a band on the

The angle-averaged correlation function of transmitted flux (F = exp(-tau)) is

of flux correlations across widely separated sightlines. A quadrupole
distortion of the redshift-space correlation function by peculiar velocities,
the signature of the gravitational instability origin of structure in the

to the data assuming linear theory redshift-space distortion and linear bias of
the transmitted flux, relative to the matter fluctuations of a standard LCDM
cosmological model (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological
constant). At 95% confidence, we find a linear bias parameter 0.16<b<0.24 and
redshift-distortion parameter 0.44<beta<1.20, at central redshift z=2.25, with
a well constrained combination b(1+\beta)=0.336 +/- 0.012. The errors on beta
are asymmetric, with beta=0 excluded at over 5 sigma confidence level. The

community detection that combines network structure with processes that support
creation and/or evolution of communities. The algorithm does not embrace the
universal approach but instead tries to focus on social networks and model
dynamic social interactions that occur on those networks. It identifies
leaders, and communities that form around those leaders. It naturally supports
overlapping communities by associating each node with a membership vector that
describes node's involvement in each community. This way, in addition to
overlapping communities, we can identify nodes that are good followers to their
leader, and also nodes with no clear community involvement that serve as a
proxy between several communities and are equally as important. We run the
algorithm for several real social networks which we believe represent a good

the GeV {\gamma}-ray regime, via the satellites Fermi and AGILE. The addition
of this new band to the observational toolbox holds promise for building a more
detailed understanding of the relativistic jets of this and other systems. We
present a rich dataset of radio, hard and soft X-ray, and {\gamma}-ray
observations of Cyg X-3 made during a flaring episode in 2010 May. We detect a
~3-d softening and recovery of the X-ray emission, followed almost immediately
by a ~1-Jy radio flare at 15 GHz, followed by a 4.3{\sigma} {\gamma}-ray flare
(E > 100 MeV) ~1.5 d later. The radio sampling is sparse, but we use archival
data to argue that it is unlikely the {\gamma}-ray flare was followed by any
significant unobserved radio flares. In this case, the sequencing of the
observed events is difficult to explain in a model in which the {\gamma}-ray
emission is due to inverse Compton scattering of the companion star's radiation
field. Our observations suggest that other mechanisms may also be responsible
for {\gamma}-ray emission from Cyg X-3.

accelerators. Nonlinear outcome of the interaction of accelerated particles
that run ahead of the shock, the so-called ""precursor"", with the unperturbed
plasma of the shock upstream, is thought to facilitate additional acceleration
of these particles and to possibly modify the hydrodynamic structure of the
shock. We explore here the linear growth of kinetic modes appearing in the
precursor-upstream interaction in relativistic shocks propagating in non and
weakly magnetized plasmas: electrostatic two-stream parallel mode and
electrostatic oblique modes. These modes are of particular interest because
they are the fastest growing modes known in this type of system. Using a
simplified distribution function for a dilute ultra-relativistic beam that is
relativistically hot in its own rest frame, yet has momenta that are narrowly
collimated in the frame of the cold upstream plasma into which it propagates,
we identify the fastest growing mode in the full $k$-space and calculate its
growth rate. We consider all types of plasma (pairs and ions-electrons) and
beam (charged and charge-neutral). We find that unstable electrostatic modes
are present in any type of plasma and for any shock parameters. We further find
that two modes, one parallel ($k_\perp=0$) and the other one oblique ($k_\perp
\sim k_\|$), are competing for dominance and that either one may dominate the
growth rate in different regions of the phase space. The dominant mode is
determined mostly by the perpendicular spread of the accelerated particle
momenta in the upstream frame, which reflects the shock Lorentz factor. The
parallel mode becomes more dominant in shocks with lower Lorentz factors (i.e.,
with larger momentum spreads). We briefly discuss possible implications of our
results for external shocks in gamma-ray burst sources.

functions that relate the predictive variables (features) to the responses
given the structure are two topics that have been widely investigated in
machine learning and statistics. Learning graphical models in two stages will
have problems because graph structure may change after considering the
features. The main contribution of this paper is the proposed method that
learns the graph structure and functions on the graph at the same time. General
graphical models with binary outcomes conditioned on predictive variables are
proved to be equivalent to multivariate Bernoulli model. The reparameterization
of the potential functions in graphical model by conditional log odds ratios in
multivariate Bernoulli model offers advantage in the representation of the
conditional independence structure in the model. Additionally, we impose a
structure penalty on groups of conditional log odds ratios to learn the graph
structure. These groups of functions are designed with overlaps to enforce
hierarchical function selection. In this way, we are able to shrink higher
order interactions to obtain a sparse graph structure. Simulation studies show
that the method is able to recover the graph structure. The analysis of county
data from Census Bureau gives interesting relations between unemployment rate,
crime and others discovered by the model.

systems and we present a consistent version of the collisionless Boltzmann
equation in the 1PN approximation. We argue that the equation presented by
Rezania and Sobouti in A&A 354 1110 (2000) is not the correct expression to
describe the evolution of a collisionless self-gravitating gas. One of the
reasons that account for the previous statement is that the energy of a
free-falling test particle, obeying the 1PN equations of motion for static
gravitational fields, is not a static solution of the mentioned equation. The
same statement holds for the angular momentum, in the case of spherical
systems. We provide the necessary corrections and obtain an equation that is
consistent with the corresponding equations of motion and the 1PN conserved
quantities. We suggest some potential relevance for the study of high density
astrophysical systems and as an application we construct the corrected version
of the post-Newtonian polytropes.

color-deconfined plasma that expands explosively and rapidly reverts to the
color-confined (hadronic) state. In non-central collisions, the zone of hot
matter is transversely anisotropic and may be ""tilted"" relative to the
direction of the incoming beams. As the matter cools and expands into the
vacuum, the evolution of the system shape depends sensitively on the dynamical
response of the plasma under extreme conditions. Two-pion intensity
interferometry performed relative to the impact parameter can be used to
measure the approximate final shape of the system, when pions decouple from the
system. We use several transport models to illustrate the dependence of the
final shape on the QCD equation of state and late-stage hadronic rescattering.
The dependence of the final shape on collision energy may reveal non-trivial
structures in the QCD phase diagram. Indeed, the few measurements published to
date show a tantalizing behaviour in an energy region under intense
experimental and theoretical scrutiny, as signatures of a first-order phase
transition may appear there. We discuss strong parallels between shape studies
in heavy ion collisions and those in two other strongly-coupled systems.

constructing well-packed atomic-detail models in small steps, enumerating
several million conformations for each monomer and covering all build-up paths.
By implementing the strategy in Rosetta and making use of high-performance

RNA loop modeling problems drawn from riboswitches, ribozymes, and the
ribosome, including ten cases that were not solvable by prior knowledge based
modeling approaches. For each loop problem, this deterministic stepwise
assembly (SWA) method either reaches atomic accuracy or exposes flaws in
Rosetta's all-atom energy function, indicating the resolution of the
conformational sampling bottleneck. To our knowledge, SWA is the first
enumerative, ab initio build-up method to systematically outperform existing
Monte Carlo and knowledge-based methods for 3D structure prediction. As a
rigorous experimental test, we have applied SWA to a small RNA motif of

of the wavevector. The effect of additional nonresonant continuous illumination
on the emission originating from the bottom of the lower polariton branch is
investigated. The additional illumination leads to a substantial increase in
the emission intensity (considerably larger than the intensity of the
photoluminescence excited by this illumination alone). This fact is explained
in terms of acceleration of the polariton relaxation to the radiative states
due to scattering by charge carriers created by the additional illumination.
The results obtained show, that at large negative detunings between the photon
and exciton modes, polariton-polariton and polariton-free carrier scattering
are the main processes responsible for the filling of states near the bottom of
the lower polariton branch.

handled through auxiliary unknown variables that are jointly estimated along
with the state based on the least-squares criterion that is regularized with

resultant iterative estimators rely on coordinate descent and the alternating

robust smoother include: i) ability to handle both types of outliers; ii)
universality to unknown nominal noise and outlier distributions; iii)
flexibility to encompass maximum a posteriori optimal estimators with reliable
performance under nominal conditions; and iv) improved performance relative to
competing alternatives at comparable complexity, as corroborated via simulated

relevant to the fact that the former are gravitationally bound while the latter
self-confined unless their masses approach the maximum mass. This difference
results in the possibility that quark stars could be very low massive whereas
neutron stars cannot. Mountains could also be build on quark stars if realistic
cold quark matter is in a solid state, and an alternative estimation of the
mountain building is present. As spinning compact objects with non-axisymmetric
mass distribution will radiate gravitational waves, the equations of states of
pulsars could be constraint by the amplitude of gravitational waves being
dependent on the heights of mountains. We then estimate the maximum mountains

measurement equation, and the difficulty in fast and accurate data association.
To overcome these challenges, the present paper introduces a grid-based model
in which the state captures target signal strengths on a known spatial grid
(TSSG). This model leads to \emph{linear} state and measurement equations,
which bypass data association and can afford state estimation via
sparsity-aware Kalman filtering (KF). Leveraging the grid-induced sparsity of
the novel model, two types of sparsity-cognizant TSSG-KF trackers are
developed: one effects sparsity through $\ell_1$-norm regularization, and the
other invokes sparsity as an extra measurement. Iterative extended KF and
Gauss-Newton algorithms are developed for reduced-complexity tracking, along
with accurate error covariance updates for assessing performance of the
resultant sparsity-aware state estimators. Based on TSSG state estimates, more
informative target position and track estimates can be obtained in a follow-up
step, ensuring that track association and position estimation errors do not
propagate back into TSSG state estimates. The novel TSSG trackers do not
require knowing the number of targets or their signal strengths, and exhibit
considerably lower complexity than the benchmark hidden Markov model filter,
especially for a large number of targets. Numerical simulations demonstrate
that sparsity-cognizant trackers enjoy improved root mean-square error
performance at reduced complexity when compared to their sparsity-agnostic
counterparts.

of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction is thus needed, but it is often
performed using a univariate feature selection procedure, that handles neither
the spatial structure of the images, nor the multivariate nature of the signal.
By introducing a hierarchical clustering of the brain volume that incorporates
connectivity constraints, we reduce the span of the possible spatial
configurations to a single tree of nested regions tailored to the signal. We
then prune the tree in a supervised setting, hence the name supervised
clustering, in order to extract a parcellation (division of the volume) such
that parcel-based signal averages best predict the target information.
Dimensionality reduction is thus achieved by feature agglomeration, and the
constructed features now provide a multi-scale representation of the signal.
Comparisons with reference methods on both simulated and real data show that

more the case when a nonstationary signal is also present. As a consequence,
the uncertainties on the power spectrum cannot be calculated based on the
chi2(2) properties, as assumed by tools such as XRONOS powspec. We generalise
the result in the case of a nonstationary signal affected by uncorrelated white
noise and show that the new distribution is a non-central chi2(2,lambda), whose
non-central value lambda is the power spectrum of the deterministic function
describing the nonstationary signal. Finally, we test these results in the case
of synthetic curves of gamma-ray bursts. We end up with a new formula for
calculating the power spectrum uncertainties. This is crucial in the case of
nonstationary short-lived processes affected by uncorrelated statistical noise,
for which ensemble averaging does not make any physical sense.

amplitude always appear essentially softer than for the nonphysical one.
Froissart's paper explicitly assumed the hypothesis of power behavior and
obtained asymptotic bound for total cross sections $\sim \log^2{(s/s_0)}$ with
some constant $s_0$. Our bounds are slightly stronger than original Froissart
ones. They show that the scale $s_0$ should itself slowly grow with $s$. Under

  VI, formula (60) corrected",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.84.046312",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A simple scheme of forcing turbulence away from decay was introduced by
Lundgren some time ago, the `linear forcing', which amounts to a force term
linear in the velocity field with a constant coefficient. The evolution of
linearly forced turbulence towards a stationary final state, as indicated by
direct numerical simulations (DNS), is examined from a theoretical point of
view based on symmetry arguments. In order to follow closely the DNS the flow
is assumed to live in a cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions. The
simplicity of the linear forcing scheme allows one to re-write the problem as
one of decaying turbulence with a decreasing viscosity. Scaling symmetry
considerations suggest that the system evolves to a stationary state, evolution
that may be understood as the gradual breaking of a larger approximate symmetry
to a smaller exact symmetry. The same arguments show that the finiteness of the
domain is intimately related to the evolution of the system to a stationary
state at late times, as well as the consistency of this state with a high
degree of isotropy imposed by the symmetries of the domain itself. The
fluctuations observed in the DNS for all quantities in the stationary state can
be associated with deviations from isotropy. Indeed, self-preserving isotropic
turbulence models are used to study evolution from a direct dynamical point of
view, emphasizing the naturalness of the Taylor microscale as a self-similarity
scale in this system. In this context the stationary state emerges as a stable
fixed point. Self-preservation seems to be the reason behind a noted similarity
of the third order structure function between the linearly forced and freely
decaying turbulence, where again the finiteness of the domain plays an
significant role.

necessary in order to handle correctly the numerical behaviour of the solution.
This reflects on a specific (spherical) geometry of the computational domain.
The numerical tests, performed under several different regimes for the
equation, prove the robustness of the scheme: their performances also point out
to the suitability of such an approach to large scale computations involving
transport physics for mass less radiative particles.

theoretic method to the spatiotemporal data of cell-phone locations, [C. Song

remarkably predictable. Inspired by their work, we address a similar
predictability question in a different kind of human social activity:
conversation events. The predictability in the sequence of one's conversation
partners is defined as the degree to which one's next conversation partner can
be predicted given the current partner. We quantify this predictability by
using the mutual information. We examine the predictability of conversation
events for each individual using the longitudinal data of face-to-face
interactions collected from two company offices in Japan. Each subject wears a
name tag equipped with an infrared sensor node, and conversation events are
marked when signals are exchanged between sensor nodes in close proximity. We
find that the conversation events are predictable to some extent; knowing the
current partner decreases the uncertainty about the next partner by 28.4% on
average. Much of the predictability is explained by long-tailed distributions
of interevent intervals. However, a predictability also exists in the data,
apart from the contribution of their long-tailed nature. In addition, an
individual's predictability is correlated with the position in the static
social network derived from the data. Individuals confined in a community - in
the sense of an abundance of surrounding triangles - tend to have low
predictability, and those bridging different communities tend to have high
predictability.

due to electron scattering in axially-symmetric Type II supernovae (SNe) which
we calculate using a Monte Carlo and a long-characteristic radiative-transfer
code. Aspherical ejecta are produced by prescribing a latitudinal scaling or
stretching of SN ejecta inputs obtained from 1-D non-LTE time-dependent
calculations. We study polarisation signatures as a function of inclination,
shape factor, wavelength, line identity, post-explosion time. At early times,
cancellation and optical-depth effects make the polarisation intrinsically low,
causing complicated sign reversals with inclination or continuum wavelength,
and across line profiles. While the line polarisation is positive (negative)
for an oblate (prolate) morphology at the peak and in the red wing, the
continuum polarisation may be of any sign. These complex polarisation
variations are produced not just by the asymmetric distribution of scatterers
but also of the flux. Our early-time signatures are in contradiction with
predictions for a centrally illuminated aspherical nebula, although this
becomes a better approximation at nebular times. For a fixed asymmetry, our
synthetic continuum polarisation is generally low, may evolve non-monotonically
during the plateau phase, but it systematically rises as the ejecta become
optically thin. Changes in polarization over time do not necessarily imply a
change in the asymmetry of the ejecta. The SN structure (e.g.,
density/ionization) critically influences the level of polarisation.
Importantly, a low polarisation (<0.5%) at early times does not necessarily
imply a low degree of asymmetry as usually assumed. Asphericity influences
line-profile morphology and the luminosity, which may compromise the accuracy
of SN characteristics inferred from these.

and physical measurements has almost universally been presented in very
classical terms following the Lifshitz-Kosevich formulation for Fermi-Landau
quasiparticles, quantized into vortices and Landau levels under the high
applied magnetic fields. The Fermi surface always emerges as a very small
fraction of the large parent Fermi surface detected at higher doping. This then
calls for some Fermi surface reconstruction to have occurred, as from a charged
density wave, etc.. The paper refutes this reciprocal space approach, and shows
that many of the more recent detailed works taking this line are not consistent
with the data. The present author developed an alternative real-space
interpretation of these matters a couple of years ago. This was in terms of
interaction of the vortex array with the stripe array, using a 2D modelling for
the latter. This approach has here been revised slightly and copes well with
addressing the wide variety of new data. The paper pursues and justifies the
BEC/BCS, negative-U based, two-subsystem modelling advocated earlier, along
with the strength and geometry of the striping acquired in a strong magnetic
field. A wide variety of recent experiments are expounded to produce an overall
appreciation of a situation far from being appropriately treated within a
Fermi-Landau quasiparticle framework. Indeed it is demonstrated that the
universality of the 'QO' observations ensues from the fractional quantum Hall
effect. The data all point to FQHE state with filling factor nu = 2/5. This
state in its genesis and expression finds a much greater alignment with the
BEC/BCS crossover condition and the proximity of the HTSC materials to
Mott-Anderson localization than does any model for this highly correlated
material appealing to well-metallized Fermi-Landau quasiparticle physics.

even at strong gravitational coupling. In particular, we find that
asymptotically safe quantum gravity where the gravitational couplings approach
a non-Gaussian fixed point generically admits universes with light fermions.
Our results thus further support quantum gravity theories built on fluctuations
of the metric field such as the asymptotic-safety scenario. A study of chiral
symmetry breaking through gravitational quantum effects may serve as a
significant benchmark test also for other quantum gravity scenarios, since a
completely broken chiral symmetry at the Planck scale would not be in
accordance with the observation of light fermions in our universe. We
demonstrate that this elementary observation already imposes constraints on a
generic UV completion of gravity.

that derivative-free optimization methods were relatively recently proven to
converge not only on smooth objective functions but also on most non-smooth and
discontinuous objective functions. This opens an avenue of posibilities for
solving problems unyielding to classical optimization techniques.
  Original abstract:
  This paper investigates the performance of using a direct search method to
design optimal Static Output Feedback (SOF) controllers for Linear Time
Invariant (LTI) systems. Considering the old age of both SOF problems and
direct search methods, surprisingly good performances will be obtained compared
to a state-of-the-art method. The motivation is to emphasize the fact that
direct search methods are too much neglected by the control community. These
methods are very rich for practical purposes on a lot of complex problems
unyielding to classical optimization techniques, like linear matrix
inequalities, thanks to their ability to explore even non-smooth functions on
non-convex feasible sets.
  Again, the key element here are the relatively new strong theoretical
convergence guarantees of derivatie-free methods. Thanks to these, using such
optimization methods is superior to other methods without convergence
guarantees (like most iterative LMI schemes).

were found from exact solution to Weibull/normal/exponential distribution, and
then to power law distribution. Intermediate asymptotic size distributions were
found to be functions of exponent $\alpha$ and vary from normal ($\alpha=0$)

better run-time performance compared to a controller with the sample-based

also study the ratio of dijet mass spectra at small and large scattering

approximate to any non-trivial factor. Thus the optimality is very difficult to
obtain due to its high complexity. A natural method is to obtain the greedy
policy considering its stability and simplicity. However, the greedy policy
will result in the optimality loss for its intrinsic myopic behavior generally.
In this paper, by analyzing one class of so-called standard reward function, we
establish the closed-form condition about the discounted factor \beta such that
the optimality of the greedy policy is guaranteed under the discounted expected
reward criterion, especially, the condition \beta = 1 indicating the optimality
of the greedy policy under the average accumulative reward criterion. Thus, the
standard form of reward function can easily be used to judge the optimality of
the greedy policy without any complicated calculation. Some examples in
cognitive radio networks are presented to verify the effectiveness of the
mathematical result in judging the optimality of the greedy policy.

describe SAVER (qoS-Aware workflows oVER the Cloud), a QoS-aware algorithm for

allows execution of arbitrary workflows subject to response time constraints.
SAVER uses a passive monitor to identify workload fluctuations based on the

by a planner component to identify the minimum number of instances of each Web
Service which should be allocated in order to satisfy the response time
constraint. SAVER uses a simple Queueing Network (QN) model to identify the
optimal resource allocation. Specifically, the QN model is used to identify
bottlenecks, and predict the system performance as Cloud resources are
allocated or released. The parameters used to evaluate the model are those
collected by the monitor, which means that SAVER does not require any
particular knowledge of the Web Services and workflows being executed. Our
approach has been validated through numerical simulations, whose results are

length, i.e., longer bars inhabit redder disk galaxies and the bars themselves
are redder, and that the bluest galaxies host the smallest galactic bars (< 5
kpc/h). We also find that bar and disk colors are clearly correlated, and for
galaxies with small bars, the disk is, on average, redder than the bar colors,
while for longer bars the bar then itself is redder, on average, than the disk.
We further find that galaxies with a prominent bulge are more likely to host
longer bars than those without bulges. We categorise our galaxy populations by
how the bar and/or ring are connected to the spiral arms. We find that galaxies
whose bars are directly connected to the spiral arms are preferentially bluer

find that stronger bars are found in galaxies which host a ring (and only a
ring). The bar length and width measurements used herein are made publicly

instability (technically an overstability), which is present in, and
potentially important for, dusty protoplanetary disks (Youdin & Goodman 2005).
The goal is a better understanding of the physical origin of such
instabilities, which are notoriously subtle. Rotational dynamics seem to be
essential to this type of instability, which cannot be captured by
one-dimensional Cartesian models. Dust `pileups' in moving pressure maxima are
an important triggering mechanism of the instability, and drag feedback of dust
upon the gas allows these maxima to be strengthened. Coriolis forces and the
background drift counteract the effects of the pressure force.

  time",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cuckoo hashing [4] is a multiple choice hashing scheme in which each item can
be placed in multiple locations, and collisions are resolved by moving items to
their alternative locations. In the classical implementation of two-way cuckoo
hashing, the memory is partitioned into contiguous disjoint fixed-size buckets.
Each item is hashed to two buckets, and may be stored in any of the positions
within those buckets. Ref. [2] analyzed a variation in which the buckets are
contiguous and overlap. However, many systems retrieve data from secondary
storage in same-size blocks called pages. Fetching a page is a relatively
expensive process; but once a page is fetched, its contents can be accessed
orders of magnitude faster. We utilize this property of memory retrieval,
presenting a variant of cuckoo hashing incorporating the following constraint:
each bucket must be fully contained in a single page, but buckets are not
necessarily contiguous. Empirical results show that this modification increases
memory utilization and decreases the number of iterations required to insert an
item. If each item is hashed to two buckets of capacity two, the page size is
8, and each bucket is fully contained in a single page, the memory utilization
equals 89.71% in the classical contiguous disjoint bucket variant, 93.78% in
the contiguous overlapping bucket variant, and increases to 97.46% in our new
non-contiguous bucket variant. When the memory utilization is 92% and we use
breadth first search to look for a vacant position, the number of iterations
required to insert a new item is dramatically reduced from 545 in the
contiguous overlapping buckets variant to 52 in our new non-contiguous bucket
variant. In addition to the empirical results, we present a theoretical lower
bound on the memory utilization of our variation as a function of the page
size.

and spin angular momentum has attracted considerable attention. It was
suggested that such interactions can lead to the realization of exotic states
of highly correlated matter. Here, we report on a theoretical study of the
competing anisotropic dispersion, magnetic dipole-dipole, and electric
quadrupole-quadrupole forces between two dysprosium atoms. Each dysprosium atom
has an orbital angular momentum L=6 and magnetic moment $\mu=10\mu_B$. We show
that the dispersion coefficients of the ground state adiabatic potentials lie
between 1865 a.u. and 1890 a.u., creating a non-negligible anisotropy with a
spread of 25 a.u. and that the electric quadrupole-quadrupole interaction is
weak compared to the other interactions. We also find that for interatomic
separations $R< 50\,a_0$ both the anisotropic dispersion and magnetic
dipole-dipole potential are larger than the atomic Zeeman splittings for
external magnetic fields of order 10 G to 100 G. At these separations spin
exchange can occur. We finish by describing two scattering models for inelastic
spin exchange. A universal scattering theory is used to model loss due to the
anisotropy in the dispersion and a distorted-wave-Born theory is used to model
losses from the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction for the $^{164}$Dy isotope.
These models find loss rates that are the same order of magnitude as the
experimental value.

minimum distance of such codes. This bound is related to the classical
Weierstrass semigroup of the curve $X$ at $P$. Further we focus our attention
on the question to recognize the Weierstrass semigroups over fields of
characteristic 0. After surveying the main tools (deformations and
smoothability of monomial curves) we prove that the semigroups of embedding
dimension four generated by an arithmetic sequence are Weierstrass.

The
system under investigation consists of an impenetrable wall and of two
hard-core particles with very different masses. The lighter particle bounces
between the heavier one and the wall. Both particles are initially represented
by narrow Gaussian wave packets. A complete analytical solution of this problem
is presented on the basis of a new method. The idea of the method is to
decompose the two-particle wave function into a continuous superposition of
terms (channels), such that the multiple collisions within each channel do not
lead to subsequent entanglement between the two particles. For each channel,
the time evolution of the two-particle wave function is completely determined
by the motion of the corresponding classical point-like particles; therefore
the whole quantum problem is reduced to a classical calculation. The
calculation based on the above method reveals the following unexpected result:
The entanglement between the two particles first increases with time due to the
collisions, but then it begins to decrease, disappearing completely when the
light particle becomes too slow to catch up with the heavy one.

evolve invariantly on a zero-gradient-sum manifold and converge asymptotically

obtain lower and upper bounds on their convergence rates in terms of the

presence of noise at the level of individual cells. In order to study these
phenomena in large-scale assemblies of neurons, we consider networks of
firing-rate neurons with linear intrinsic dynamics and nonlinear coupling,
belonging to a few types of cell populations and receiving noisy currents.
Asymptotic equations as the number of neurons tends to infinity (mean field
equations) are rigorously derived based on a probabilistic approach. These
equations are implicit on the probability distribution of the solutions which
generally makes their direct analysis difficult. However, in our case, the
solutions are Gaussian, and their moments satisfy a closed system of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are much easier to study than the
original stochastic network equations, and the statistics of the empirical
process uniformly converge towards the solutions of these ODEs. Based on this
description, we analytically and numerically study the influence of noise on
the collective behaviors, and compare these asymptotic regimes to simulations
of the network. We observe that the mean field equations provide an accurate
description of the solutions of the network equations for network sizes as
small as a few hundreds of neurons. In particular, we observe that the level of
noise in the system qualitatively modifies its collective behavior, producing
for instance synchronized oscillations of the whole network, desynchronization
of oscillating regimes, and stabilization or destabilization of stationary
solutions. These results shed a new light on the role of noise in shaping
collective dynamics of neurons, and gives us clues for understanding similar
phenomena observed in biological networks.

confidence level, with a value of theta_{BAO} (z=0.55) = (3.90 \pm 0.38)
degrees, including systematic errors. To our understanding, this is the first
direct measurement of the angular BAO scale in the galaxy distribution, and it
is in agreement with previous BAO measurements. We also show how radial
determinations of the BAO scale can break the degeneracy in the measurement of
cosmological parameters when they are combined with BAO angular measurements.
