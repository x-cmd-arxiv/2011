unrelated phenomena? Here it is argued that the reason is that they can all be
described as outcomes of a ubiquitous random group division: the elements can
be citizens of a country and the groups family names, or the elements can be
all the words making up a novel and the groups the unique words, or the
elements could be inhabitants and the groups the cities in a country, and so
on. A Random Group Formation (RGF) is presented from which a Bayesian estimate
is obtained based on minimal information: it provides the best prediction for
the number of groups with $k$ elements, given the total number of elements,
groups, and the number of elements in the largest group. For each specification
of these three values, the RGF predicts a unique group distribution
$N(k)\propto \exp(-bk)/k^{\gamma}$, where the power-law index $\gamma$ is a
unique function of the same three values. The universality of the result is
made possible by the fact that no system specific assumptions are made about
the mechanism responsible for the group division. The direct relation between
$\gamma$ and the total number of elements, groups, and the number of elements
in the largest group, is calculated. The predictive power of the RGF model is
demonstrated by direct comparison with data from a variety of systems. It is
shown that $\gamma$ usually takes values in the interval $1\leq\gamma\leq 2$
and that the value for a given phenomena depends in a systematic way on the
total size of the data set. The results are put in the context of earlier
discussions on Zipf's and Gibrat's laws, $N(k)\propto k^{-2}$ and the
connection between growth models and RGF is elucidated.

(MHD) kink waves in the solar atmosphere. Waves and flows are often observed
simultaneously. Due to plasma inhomogeneity in the perpendicular direction to
the magnetic field, kink waves are spatially damped by resonant absorption. The
presence of flow may affect the wave spatial damping. Here, we investigate the
effect of longitudinal background flow on the propagation and spatial damping
of resonant kink waves in transversely nonuniform magnetic flux tubes. We
combine approximate analytical theory with numerical investigation. The
analytical theory uses the thin tube (TT) and thin boundary (TB) approximations
to obtain expressions for the wavelength and the damping length. Numerically,
we verify the previously obtained analytical expressions by means of the full
solution of the resistive MHD eigenvalue problem beyond the TT and TB
approximations. We find that the backward and forward propagating waves have
different wavelengths and are damped on length scales that are inversely
proportional to the frequency as in the static case. However, the factor of
proportionality depends on the characteristics of the flow, so that the damping
length differs from its static analogue. For slow, sub-Alfvenic flows the
backward propagating wave gets damped on a shorter length scale than in the
absence of flow, while for the forward propagating wave the damping length is
longer. The different properties of the waves depending on their direction of
propagation with respect to the background flow may be detected by the
observations and may be relevant for seismological applications.

transition belonging to the 2D Ising universality class. According to Prakash

fourfold-symmetric ground states which suggests a similarity to the four-state
clock model. Provided that this type of symmetry connection holds true, the
magnetic dipoles on a honeycomb lattice, which possess sixfold-symmetric ground
states, should exhibit a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in accordance with the
six-state clock model. This is verified through numerical simulations in the
present investigation. However, it is pointed out that this symmetry argument
does not always apply, which suggests that factors other than symmetry can be

relativistic profile consistent with emission from an accretion disk at tens of
gravitational radii from the central black hole. The XIS data indicate emission
from highly ionized iron and allow us to set tight, albeit model-dependent,
constraints on the inner and outer radii of the disk reflecting region,
r_in~10r_g and r_out~20r_g, respectively, and on the disk inclination, i~30deg.
Two ionized reflection components are possibly observed, with similar
contributions of ~10% to the total continuum. A highly ionized one, with
log_xi~3, which successfully models the relativistic line and a mildly ionized
one, with log_xi~1.5, which models the narrow Fe K line and high energy hump.
When both these components are included, there is no further requirement for an
additional black body soft excess below 2keV. The Suzaku data confirm the
presence of a warm absorber previously known from grating studies. After
accounting for all the spectral features, the intrinsic photon index of the
X-ray continuum is ~1.8 with a cutoff energy at ~200keV, consistent with
Comptonization models and excluding jet-related emission up to these energies.
Comparison of the X-ray properties of 3C 382 and other BLRGs to Seyferts

at X-rays is blurred.

deviations from the classical, Einstein dilation of the decay evolution of
moving or Lorentz boosted unstable particles. While the general claim is
correct, the discussions have been incomplete and, sometimes, misleading. The
discussions have been of three kinds. Type 1 examines the time dependence of
the survival probability for 3-momentum eigenstates of the unstable quanton
(Khalfin). Type 2 does the same for velocity eigenstates, obtaining an
outrageous result which then discredits velocity eigenstates (Shirokov /
Hegerfeldt). Type 3 examines arbitrary boosts of 3-momentum eigenstates
(Stefanovich). Type 1 is incomplete since the momentum eigenstates are not the
boosts of one another. Type 2 is misleading since the outrageous result is due
to misinterpreting the initial conditions of the velocity eigenstates (as I
have previously argued). Type 3 is the most satisfactory, but has failed to
recognize and implement the unification of all three types of discussion that
can be achieved. In this paper I will provide that unified treatment, beginning
with a recapitulation of Type 1 and offering further clarification of Type 2 in
the process. The unified treatment fully reinstates velocity eigenstates as
essential contributors to unstable quanton states. Besides discussing the time
evolution of survival probabilities I also focus on the concept of lifetime
defined as the average time of decay. This quantity is helpful in order to
display the inequivalent dependence of dilation on momentum and boosts most
sharply and the deviation from Einstein dilation most cleanly.

Shparlinski ({\it International Journal of Quantum Information} 5 (2007),
417--430) proved that $|F(\tau)_{aa}|=1$ for some $a\in V(G)$ and $\tau\in
\R^+$ if and only if all eigenvalues of $G$ are integer (that is, the graph is
integral). The integral circulant graph $\ICG_n (D)$ has the vertex set $Z_n =
\{0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1\}$ and vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent if
$\gcd(a-b,n)\in D$, where $D \subseteq \{d : d \mid n,\ 1\leq d<n\}$. These
graphs are highly symmetric and have important applications in chemical graph
theory. We show that $\ICG_n (D)$ has PST if and only if $n\in 4\N$ and
$D=\widetilde{D_3}\cup D_2\cup 2D_2\cup 4D_2\cup \{n/2^a\}$, where
$\widetilde{D_3}=\{d\in D\ |\ n/d\in 8\N\}$, $D_2= \{d\in D\ |\ n/d\in
8\N+4\}\setminus \{n/4\}$ and $a\in\{1,2\}$. We have thus answered the question
of complete characterization of perfect state transfer in integral circulant
graphs raised in {\it Quantum Information and Computation}, Vol. 10, No. 3&4
(2010) 0325--0342 by Angeles-Canul {\it et al.} Furthermore, we also calculate
perfect quantum communication distance (distance between vertices where PST
occurs) and describe the spectra of integral circulant graphs having PST. We
conclude by giving a closed form expression calculating the number of integral
circulant graphs of a given order having PST.

rest-frame UV spectra available in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release
Three. This estimation is possible due to the existence of an empirical
correlation between the radius of the broad line region and the continuum
luminosity at 3000 Angstroms. We regenerate this correlation by applying our
measurement method to UV spectra of low-redshift quasars in the HST/IUE
databases which have corresponding reverberation mapping estimates of the Hbeta
broad line region's radius. Our mass estimation method uses the line dispersion
rather than the full width at half maximum of the low-ionization MgII emission
line. We measure MgII line dispersions for quasars whose spectra have been
reconstructed using the most significant eigenspectra produced through
Principal Component Analysis. We have tested the reliability of using
reconstructed spectra in black hole mass estimation using a Monte Carlo
simulation and by comparing the results from original and reconstructed Data
Release Three spectra. We show that using reconstructed spectra not only makes
bias-free mass estimation possible for quasars with low spectroscopic
signal-to-noise ratio, but also reduces the intrinsic scatter of the
distribution of the black hole masses to lower than 0.15 dex.

namely the total area, although one find three apparently different conserved
integrals which effectively the total area. We show that one of the conserved
quantity of the WPSL obtained either by setting $n=1$ or $n=4$ can be used to
perform multifractal analysis. For instance, we show that if the $i$th block is
populated with either $p_i\sim x_i^3$ or $p_i\sim y_i^3$ then the resulting
distribution in the WPSL exhibits multifractality. Furthermore, we show that
the dual of the WPSL, obtained by replacing each block with a node at its
center and common border between blocks with an edge joining the two vertices,
emerges as a scale-free network since its degree distribution exhibits
power-law $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$ with exponent $\gamma=5.66$. It implies that
the coordination number distribution of the WPSL is scale-free in character as
we find that $P(k)$ also describes the fraction of blocks having $k$

realized among local bistable variables (spins) in systems where the elastic
interaction causes ordering of the spins. In such systems, generally we expect
both long-range and short-range interactions to exist. In the short-range Ising
model, the correlation length diverges at the critical point. In contrast, in
the long-range interacting model the spin configuration is always uniform and
the correlation length is zero. As long as a system has non-zero long-range
interactions, it shows criticality in the mean-field universality class, and
the spin configuration is uniform beyond a certain scale. Here we study the
crossover from the pure short-range interacting model to the long-range
interacting model. We investigate the infinite-range model (Husimi-Temperley
model) as a prototype of this competition, and we study how the critical
temperature changes as a function of the strength of the long-range
interaction. This model can also be interpreted as an approximation for the
Ising model on a small-world network. We derive a formula for the critical
temperature as a function of the strength of the long-range interaction. We
also propose a scaling form for the spin correlation length at the critical
point, which is finite as long as the long-range interaction is included,
though it diverges in the limit of the pure short-range model. These properties
are confirmed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

(IC) luminosity from the quasi-simultaneous broadband spectrum energy

quantitatively to the observation data from the previous work and it shows

exchanges to the edge coloring of simple graphs. Vizing's theorem states that
the edge coloring of a simple graph $G$ requires either $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$
colors, where $\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree of $G$. Holyer proved that
it is {\bf NP}-complete to decide whether $G$ is $\Delta$-edge-colorable even
for cubic graphs. By introducing the concept of complex colors, we show that
the color-exchange operation follows the same multiplication rules as
quaternion. An initially $\Delta$-edge-colored graph $G$ allows
variable-colored edges, which can be eliminated by color exchanges in a manner
similar to variable eliminations in solving systems of linear equations. The
problem is solved if all variables are eliminated and a properly
$\Delta$-edge-colored graph is reached. For a randomly generated graph $G$, we
prove that our algorithm returns a proper $\Delta$-edge-coloring with a
probability of at least 1/2 in $O(\Delta|V||E|^5)$ time if $G$ is
$\Delta$-edge-colorable. Otherwise, the algorithm halts in polynomial time and
signals the impossibility of a solution, meaning that the chromatic index of
$G$ probably equals $\Delta+1$. Animations of the edge-coloring algorithms

Nd2O3 (where M and M' are respectively an alkali and alkaline earth cation) is
currently under study as potential nuclear waste form. In this work, we were
interested in the structure of this glass in relation with the modifier cation
type. Two different glass series were elaborated by changing separately the
nature of the alkaline (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and the alkaline-earth (M'=Mg, Ca,
Sr, Ba) ions and different structural studies were intended to elucidate the
local environment of the rare-earth and the network arrangement. Only slight
effect was put in evidence on the covalency degree and the length of Nd-O
linkage with a change of M or M', by optical spectroscopy and EXAFS
measurements. Raman and MAS NMR (29Si, 27Al, 11B) spectroscopies showed a
variation of the polymerization degree of the network with the size of the
modifier cation. Finally, the most important feature of this glass composition
is related to the AlO4- charge compensation which was proved to be uniquely
assured by alkali cations.

nucleates within a metastable vapor phase when an intermediate metastable

of a solid core and a liquid wetting layer as well as pure liquid and pure
solid critical nuclei can exist depending not only on the supersaturation of
the liquid phase relative to that of the vapor phase but also on the wetting
behavior of the liquid surrounding the solid. The existence of liquid critical
nucleus indicates that the phase transformation from metastable vapor to stable
solid occurs via the intermediate metastable liquid phase, which is quite
similar to the scenario of nucleation observed in proteins and colloidal
systems. By studying the minimum-free-energy path on the free-energy landscape,
we can study the evolution of the composition of solid and liquid within nuclei

range by means of a monochromator constituted by a cell filled with a

narrow-bandwidth absorbing resonances following the Fano profile. In
particular, within the photon energy range 60 eV - 65 eV, the correlation index
of the Fano profiles for the photo-ionization spectra in Helium is equal to
unity, meaning that the minimum of the cross-section is exactly zero. For
sufficiently large column density in the gas cell, the spectrum of the incoming
radiation will be attenuated by the background cross-section of many orders of
magnitude, except for those wavelengths close to the point where the
cross-section is zero. Remarkable advantages of a gas monochromator based on
this principle are simplicity, efficiency and narrow-bandwidth. A gas
monochromator installed in the experimental hall of a VUV SASE FEL facility
would enable the delivery of a single-mode VUV laser beam. The design is
identical to that of already existing gas attenuator systems for VUV or X-ray
FELs. We present feasibility study and exemplifications for the FLASH facility

monopole are explicitly given in terms of a degree N rational map. Within this
approximation, it is shown that the minimal energy monopole of charge N has the
same symmetry as the minimal energy Skyrmion with baryon number N in Minkowski
spacetime. Beyond charge two the minimal energy monopole has only a discrete
symmetry, which is often Platonic. The rational map approximation provides an
upper bound on the monopole energy and may be viewed as a smooth non-abelian
refinement of the magnetic bag approximation, to which it reverts under some
additional approximations. The analytic results are supported by numerical
solutions obtained from simulations of the non-abelian field theory. A similar
analysis is performed on the monopole wall that emerges in the large N limit,

singular spectral shift functions, where it was in particular proved that the
singular part of the spectral shift function is an a.e. integer-valued
function. It was also shown that the singular spectral shift function is a
locally constant function of the coupling constant $r,$ with possible jumps
only at resonance points. Main result of this paper asserts that the jump of
the singular spectral shift function at a resonance point is equal to the
so-called resonance index, --- a new (to the best of my knowledge) notion
introduced in this paper.
  Resonance index can be described as follows. For a fixed $\lambda$ the
resonance points $r_0$ of a path $H_r$ of self-adjoint operators are real poles
of a certain meromorphic function associated with the triple $(\lambda+i0;
H_0,V).$ When $\lambda+i0$ is shifted to $\lambda+iy$ with small $y>0,$ that
pole get off the real axis in the coupling constant complex plane and, in
general, splits into some $N_+$ poles in the upper half-plane and some $N_-$
poles in the lower half-plane (counting multiplicities). Resonance index of the
triple $(\lambda; H_{r_0},V)$ is the difference $N_+-N_-.$
  Based on the theorem just described, a non-trivial example of singular
spectral shift function is given.

that moved-the Neolithic Package-consisting of domesticated plants and animals

cultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and
partly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists,
paleontologists and geneticists a final resolution of the debate has not yet
been reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global
Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES), a mathematical model
for regional sociocultural development embedded in the western Eurasian
geoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is
able to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous
space-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in Europe. GLUES, in
contrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, also
describes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. In the
model analysis, we uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information
exchange. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well
have arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes, but not in Northern and
Central Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material, (2) both
demic diffusion by migration or cultural diffusion by trade may explain the

hypermutation has been found experimentally. Evolved evolvability is a
prominent explanation. We investigate a more generally applicable explanation
by a physical constraint. Methods and Results: A generic thermodynamical
analysis of genetic information storage obviates physical constraints on the
integrity of genetic information. The capability to employ metabolic resources
is found as a major determinant of mutation probability in stored genetic
information. Incorporation into a non-recombinant, asexual adaptation toy model
predicts cases of markedly accelerated adaptation, driven by a transient
increase of mutation rate. No change in the mutation rate as a genetic trait is
required. The mutation rate of one and the same genotype varies dependent on
stress level. Implications: Stress-dependent mutation rates are physically
necessary and challenge a condition-independent genotype to mutation rate
mapping. This holds implications for evolutionary theory and pathogen and
cancer evolution.

With the arrival of the next generation of ground-based imaging
interferometers combining from 4 to possibly 6 telescopes simultaneously, there
is also a strong need for a new generation of fringe trackers able to cophase
such arrays. These instruments have to be very sensitive and to provide robust
operations in quickly varying observational conditions.
  Aims. We aim at defining the optimal characteristics of fringe sensor
concepts operating with 4 or 6 telescopes. The current detector limitations
impose us to consider solutions based on co-axial pairwise combination schemes.
  Methods. We independently study several aspects of the fringe sensing
process: 1) how to measure the phase and the group delay, and 2) how to combine
the telescopes in order to ensure a precise and robust fringe tracking in real
conditions. Thanks to analytical developments and numerical simulations, we
define the optimal fringe-sensor concepts and compute the expected performance
of the 4-telescope one with our dedicated end-to-end simulation tool sim2GFT.
  Results. We first show that measuring the phase and the group delay by
obtaining the data in several steps (i.e. by temporally modulating the optical
path difference) is extremely sensitive to atmospheric turbulence and therefore
conclude that it is better to obtain the fringe position with a set of data
obtained simultaneously. Subsequently, we show that among all co-axial pairwise
schemes, moderately redundant concepts increase the sensitivity as well as the
robustness in various atmospheric or observing conditions. Merging all these
results, end-to-end simulations show that our 4-telescope fringe sensor concept
is able to track fringes at least 90% of the time up to limiting magnitudes of
7.5 and 9.5 for the 1.8- and 8.2-meter VLTI telescopes respectively.

theory in which wavepacket reduction is treated as a genuine physical process.
Here it is shown that the mathematical formalism of GRW can be given an
interpretation in terms of an evolving distribution of particles on
configuration space similar to Bohmian mechanics (BM). The GRW wavefunction
acts as a pilot wave for the set of particles. In addition, a continuous stream
of noisy information concerning the precise whereabouts of the particles must
be specified. Nonlinear filtering techniques are used to determine the dynamics
of the distribution of particles conditional on this noisy information and
consistency with the GRW wavefunction dynamics is demonstrated. Viewing this
development as a hybrid BM-GRW theory, it is argued that, besides helping to
clarify the relationship between the GRW theory and BM, its merits make it
worth considering in its own right.

representation of visual space, with a roughly repetitive aperiodic map of
orientation preferences superimposed. It was recently found that orientation
preference maps (OPMs) obey statistical laws which are apparently invariant
among species widely separated in eutherian evolution. Here, we examine whether
one of the most prominent models for the optimization of cortical maps, the
elastic net (EN) model, can reproduce this common design. The EN model
generates representations which optimally trade of stimulus space coverage and
map continuity. While this model has been used in numerous studies, no
analytical results about the precise layout of the predicted OPMs have been
obtained so far. We present a mathematical approach to analytically calculate
the cortical representations predicted by the EN model for the joint mapping of
stimulus position and orientation. We find that in all previously studied
regimes, predicted OPM layouts are perfectly periodic. An unbiased search
through the EN parameter space identifies a novel regime of aperiodic OPMs with
pinwheel densities lower than found in experiments. In an extreme limit,
aperiodic OPMs quantitatively resembling experimental observations emerge.
Stabilization of these layouts results from strong nonlocal interactions rather
than from a coverage-continuity-compromise. Our results demonstrate that
optimization models for stimulus representations dominated by nonlocal
suppressive interactions are in principle capable of correctly predicting the
common OPM design. They question that visual cortical feature representations
can be explained by a coverage-continuity-compromise.

phenomena by the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) method, we have computed
grids of hydrodynamic models for binary systems based on which we have
constructed the light curves as a function of the orbital phase.The main
emphasis is on investigating the properties of the brightness oscillations.
Therefore, the model parameters were varied within the following ranges: the
component mass ratio q = M2 : M1 = 0.2 - 0.5 and the eccentricity e = 0 - 0.7.
The parameter that defined the binary viscosity was also varied. We adopted
optical grain characteristics typical of circumstellar dust. Our computations
have shown that bimodal oscillations are excited in binaries with eccentric
orbits, provided that the binary components do not differ too much in mass. In
this case, the ratios of the periods and amplitudes of the bimodal oscillations

adaptive noise cancellation is to acquire an estimation of the unwanted

cancellation operation is controlled adaptively with the target of achieving
improved signal to noise ratio. This paper concentrates upon the analysis of
adaptive noise canceller using Recursive Least Square (RLS), Fast Transversal
Recursive Least Square (FTRLS) and Gradient Adaptive Lattice (GAL) algorithms.
The performance analysis of the algorithms is done based on convergence
behavior, convergence time, correlation coefficients and signal to noise ratio.
After comparing all the simulated results we observed that GAL performs the
best in noise cancellation in terms of Correlation Coefficient, SNR and

the first time may decide which alternative nature actually prefers on the
fundamental, quantum level. If each microscopic event is truly random (e.g. as
assumed in orthodox quantum mechanics) objective reality is not valid, whereas
if each event is described by an unknown but deterministic mechanism (""hidden

well-known reconstruction method of Ruelle and Takens; in the former case no
structure should be discerned, in the latter a reconstructed structure should
be visible. This could in principle be tested by comparing individual ""hits"" in
a double slit experiment, but in practice a single fluorescent atom, and its

exploiting either lensing statistics of strongly lensed sources or time delay
measurements of lensed gravitational wave signals. These lensing methods do not
need the measurement of the redshifts of the sources and the identification of
their electromagnetic counterparts. They would extend cosmological probes to
redshift z <= 10 and are then complementary to other lower or higher redshift
tests, such as type Ia supernovae or cosmic microwave background. The accuracy
of lensing tests strongly depends on the formation history of the merging
binaries, and the related number of total detectable multiple images. Lensing
amplification might also help to find the host galaxies. Any measurement of the
source redshifts would allow to exploit the distance-redshift test in
combination with lensing methods. Time-delay analyses might measure the Hubble
parameter H_0 with accuracy of >= 10 km s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}. With prior knowledge of

frequencies. Optical absorption in the visible range has been enhanced by 4 to
5%. This composition has exhibited large scope of tailoring room temperature
ferromagnetic moment and optical band gap by varying grain size and non-ambient
(vacuum) heat treatment of the as prepared samples by mechanical alloying.

disks in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) allow important tests of accretion
theory. In recent years it has been possible to use the Fe K line and
reflection continuum to parametrize the ionization state of the irradiated
inner accretion disk. Here, we collect 10 measurements of xi, the disk
ionization parameter, from 8 AGNs with strong evidence for reflection from the
inner accretion disk and good black hole mass estimates. We find strong
statistical evidence (98.56% confidence) for a nearly linear correlation
between xi and the AGN Eddington ratio. Moreover, such a correlation is
predicted by a simple application of alpha-disk accretion theory, albeit with a
stronger dependence on the Eddington ratio. The theory shows that there will be
intrinsic scatter to any correlation as a result of different black hole spins
and radii of reflection. There are several possibilities to soften the
predicted dependence on the Eddington ratio to allow a closer agreement with
the observed correlation, but the current data does not allow for an unique
explanation. The correlation can be used to estimate that MCG-6-30-15 should
have a highly ionized inner accretion disk, which would imply a black hole spin
of ~0.8. Additional measurements of xi from a larger sample of AGNs are needed
to confirm the existence of this correlation, and will allow investigation of
the accretion disk/corona interaction in the inner regions of accretion disks.
