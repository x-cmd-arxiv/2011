is governed by a simulation-based projection, which allows the agent to project
itself into future situations before it takes real action. Projective
simulation is based on a random walk through a network of clips, which are
elementary patches of episodic memory. The network of clips changes
dynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional
principles of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened
for specific features which trigger factual action of the agent. The scheme is
different from other, computational, notions of simulation, and it provides a
new element in an embodied cognitive science approach to intelligent action and
learning. Our model provides a natural route for generalization to
quantum-mechanical operation and connects the fields of reinforcement learning
and quantum computation.

especially in recent compressed sensing theory. This paper studies the solution
path of the $\ell$-1 norm penalized least-square problem, whose constrained
form is known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). A
solution path is the set of all the optimizers with respect to the evolution of
the hyperparameter (Lagrange multiplier). The study of the solution path is of
great significance in viewing and understanding the profile of the tradeoff
between the approximation and regularization terms. If the solution path of a
given problem is known, it can help us to find the optimal hyperparameter under
a given criterion such as the Akaike Information Criterion. In this paper we
present a sufficient condition on $\ell$-1 norm penalized least-square problem.
Under this sufficient condition, the number of nonzero entries in the optimizer
or solution vector increases monotonically when the hyperparameter decreases.
We also generalize the result to the often used total variation case, where the
$\ell$-1 norm is taken over the first order derivative of the solution vector.
We prove that the proposed condition has intrinsic connections with the
condition given by Donoho, et al \cite{Donoho08} and the positive cone
condition by Efron {\it el al} \cite{Efron04}. However, the proposed condition
does not need to assume the sparsity level of the signal as required by Donoho
et al's condition, and is easier to verify than Efron, et al's positive cone
condition when being used for practical applications.

$\rho_{DE}(t)=\rho_X(t)+\rho_Z(t)$, where $\rho_X$ is the component that
accelerates the Hubble expansion at late times and $\rho_Z(t)$ is an extra
contribution proportional to $H^2(t)$. This form of $\rho_Z(t)$ follows from
the recent proposal that the contribution of zero-point fluctuations of quantum
fields to the total energy density should be computed by subtracting the
Minkowski-space result from that computed in the FRW space-time. We discuss
theoretical arguments that support this subtraction. By definition, this
eliminates the quartic divergence in the vacuum energy density responsible for
the cosmological constant problem. We show that the remaining quadratic
divergence can be reabsorbed into a redefinition of Newton's constant only
under the assumption that the energy-momentum tensor of vacuum fluctuations is
conserved in isolation. However, in the presence of an ultra-light scalar field
$X$ with $m_X<H_0$, as typical of some dark energy models, the gravity
effective action depends both on the gravitational field and on the $X$ field.
In this case general covariance only requires the conservation of the total
energy-momentum tensor, including both the classical term $T^X_{\mu\nu}$ and
the vacuum expectation value of T_{\mu\nu}. If there is an exchange of energy
between these two terms, there are potentially observable consequences. We
construct an explicit model with an interaction between $\rho_X$ and $\rho_Z$
and we show that the total dark energy density
$\rho_{DE}(t)=\rho_X(t)+\rho_Z(t)$ always remains a finite fraction of the
critical density at any time, providing a specific model of early dark energy.
We discuss the implication of this result for the coincidence problem and we
estimate the model parameters by means of a full likelihood analysis using
current CMB, SNe Ia and BAO data.

propose an extension of the force density method (FDM)(H.J. Schek, 1974), a
form-finding method for prestressed cable-net structures. The second one is to
present a review of various form-finding methods for tension structures, in the
relation with the extended FDM. In the first part, it is pointed out that the
original FDM become useless when it is applied to the prestressed structures
that consist of combinations of both tension and compression members, while the
FDM is usually advantageous in form-finding analysis of cable-nets. To
eliminate the limitation, a functional whose stationary problem simply
represents the FDM is firstly proposed. Additionally, the existence of a
variational principle in the FDM is also indicated. Then, the FDM is
extensively redefined by generalizing the formulation of the functional. As the
result, the generalized functionals enable us to find the forms of tension
structures that consist of combinations of both tension and compression
members, such as tensegrities and suspended membranes with compression struts.
In the second part, it is indicated the important role of three expressions
used by the description of the extended FDM, such as stationary problems of
functionals, the principle of virtual work and stationary conditions using
Nabla symbol. They can be commonly found in general problems of statics,
whereas the original FDM only provides a particular form of equilibrium
equation. Then, to demonstrate the advantage of such expressions, various
form-finding methods are reviewed and compared. As the result, the common
features and the differences over various form-finding methods are examined.
Finally, to give an overview of the reviewed methods, the corresponding
expressions are shown in the form of three tables.

according to a fixed rate. With the advancement of Smart Grid technologies,
large-scale implementation of variable-rate metering becomes more practical. As
a result, consumers will be able to control their electricity consumption in an
automated fashion, where one possible scheme is to have each individual
maximize its own utility as a noncooperative game. In this paper,
noncooperative games are formulated among the electricity consumers in Smart
Grid with two real-time pricing schemes, where the Nash equilibrium operation
points are investigated for their uniqueness and load balancing properties. The
first pricing scheme charges a price according to the average cost of
electricity borne by the retailer and the second one charges according to a
time-variant increasing-block price, where for each scheme, a zero-revenue
model and a constant-rate revenue model are considered. In addition, the
relationship between the studied games and certain competitive routing games
from the computer networking community, known as atomic flow games, is
established, for which it is shown that the proposed noncooperative game
formulation falls under the class of atomic splittable flow games. The Nash
equilibrium is shown to exist for four different combined cases corresponding
to the two pricing schemes and the two revenue models, and is unique for three
of the cases under certain conditions. It is further shown that both pricing
schemes lead to similar electricity loading patterns when consumers are only
interested in minimizing the electricity costs without any other profit
considerations. Finally, the conditions under which the increasing-block
pricing scheme is preferred over the average-cost based pricing scheme are
discussed.

require that the average degree of the graph is Omega(log k). To this end, we
consider a new non-standard SDP program for Unique Games, which is not a
relaxation for the problem, and show how to analyze it. We present a new
rounding scheme that simultaneously uses SDP and LP solutions, which we believe
is of independent interest.
  Our result holds only for epsilon less than some absolute constant. We prove
that if epsilon > 1/2, then the problem is hard in one of the models, the
result assumes the 2-to-2 conjecture.
  Finally, we study semi-random instances of Unique Games that are at most
(1-epsilon) satisfiable. We present an algorithm that with high probability,
distinguishes between the case when the instance is a semi-random instance and
the case when the instance is an (arbitrary) (1-delta) satisfiable instance if
epsilon > c delta.

classification of classes of directed graphs which is diametric to existing

all classes of directed graphs whose underlying undirected class is nowhere
dense, such as planar, bounded-genus, and $H$-minor-free graphs; and on the

crownful classes of directed graphs. This is of particular interest as these
problems are not tractable on any existing digraph measure for sparse classes.
  The algorithmic results are established via proving a structural equivalence
of nowhere crownful classes and classes of graphs which are directed uniformly

  Let k be a field and B=k<x,y>(y^2). We consider B as the homogeneous

""quasi-coherent sheaves"" on it is, by fiat, the quotient category
QGr(B):=Gr(B)/Fdim(B) and the category of coherent sheaves on it is
qgr(B):=gr(B)/fdim(B), where gr(B) is the category of finitely presented graded
modules and fdim(B) is the full subcategory of finite dimensional graded

finite dimensional semisimple algebras S_n=M_{f_n}(k) + M_{f_{n-1}}(k) where
f_{n-1} and f_n$ are adjacent Fibonacci numbers and the maps S_n \to S_{n+1}
are (a,b)--->(diag(a,b),a). When k is the complex numbers, the norm closure of
S is the C^*-algebra Connes uses to view the space of Penrose tilings as a
non-commutative space. Objects in QGr B have projective resolutions of length
at most one so the non-commutative scheme is, in a certain sense, a smooth
non-commutative curve. Penrose tilings of the plane are in bijection with
infinite sequences z=z_0z_1 ... of 0s and 1s with no consecutive 1s. We
associate to each such sequence a graded B-module, a ""point module"", that
becomes a simple object O_z in QGr B that we think of as a ""skyscraper sheaf""
at a ""point"" on this non-commutative curve.
  Tilings T_z and T_{z'} determined by two such sequences are equivalent, i.e.,
the same up to a translation on R^2, if and only if O_z is isomorphic to
O_{z'}. A result of Herbera shows that Ext^1(O_z,O_{z'}) is non-zero for all z

identify what additional measurements need to be made to answer the fundamental
questions about how solar wind streams are produced, and CPI's next-generation
capabilities were designed specifically to make those measurements. Compared to
previous instruments, CPI provides unprecedented sensitivity, a wavelength
range extending from 25.7 to 126 nm, higher temporal resolution, and the
capability to measure line profiles of He II, N V, Ne VII, Ne VIII, Si VIII, S
IX, Ar VIII, Ca IX, and Fe X, never before seen in coronal holes above 1.3
solar radii. CPI will constrain the properties and effects of coronal MHD waves
by (1) observing many ions over a large range of charge and mass, (2) providing
simultaneous measurements of proton and electron temperatures to probe
turbulent dissipation mechanisms, and (3) measuring amplitudes of low-frequency
compressive fluctuations. CPI is an internally occulted ultraviolet coronagraph
that provides the required high sensitivity without the need for a deployable

Nicolson approximation at low Bond numbers for far greater particle sizes than
previously assumed. We find that viscous hydrodynamics interactions between the
spheres needs to be included to describe the dynamics close to contact. We then
consider the aggregates formed when a third sphere is added after the initial
two spheres are already in contact. In this case, we find that linear
superposition of capillary forces describes the observed approach qualitatively
but not quantitatively. Further, we observe an angular dependence of the
structure due to a rapid decrease of capillary force with distance of
separation which has a tendency to align the particles before contact. When the
three particles come in contact, they may preserve their shape or rearrange to
form an equilateral triangle cluster - the lowest energy state - depending on
the competition between attraction between particles and friction. Using these
observations, we demonstrate that a linear particle chain can be built from
frictional particles with capillary attraction.

accompanied by electroweak radiative corrections, in which a $W$ or $Z$ boson

helicity suppressed annihilation rate to fermions, bremsstrahlung process can
remove this helicity suppression such that the branching ratios Br($\ell \nu W

important phenomenological consequences both for the magnitude of the total

simulations addressing the crystallization of monodisperse hard-sphere glasses
at constant volume (as in a colloid experiment). Multiple crystalline patches
appear without particles having to diffuse more than one diameter. As these

it allows for a suitable optimization of a ""reference"" system to the

with a vector like multiplet which mixes with the third generation in an
extension of the MSSM. Such mixings allow for new CP violating phases.
Including these new CP phases, the chromoelectric dipole moment that generates
an electric dipole of the top in this class of models is computed. The top
chromoelectric dipole moment operator arises from loops involving the exchange
of the W, the Z as well as from the exchange involving the charginos, the
neutralinos, the gluino, and the vector like multiplet and their superpartners.
The analysis of the chromoelectric dipole moment operator of the top is more
complicated than for the light quarks because the mass of the external fermion,
in this case the top quark mass, cannot be ignored relative to the masses
inside the loops. A numerical analysis is presented and it is shown that the
contribution to the top EDM could lie in the range ($10^{-19}-10^{-18})$ ecm
consistent with the current limits on the EDM of the electron, the neutron and
on atomic EDMs. A top EDM of size $(10^{-19}-10^{-18})$ ecm could be accessible
in collider experiments such as at the LHC and at the ILC.

formation of massive black hole seeds is dictated directly by the local gas
density, temperature, and metallicity, and motivated by physical models of
massive black hole formation. We explore seed black hole populations as a
function of halo mass and redshift, and examine how varying the efficiency of
massive black hole seed formation affects the relationship between black holes
and their hosts. Seed black holes tend to form in halos with mass between 10^7

diffusion of metals throughout the intergalactic medium. We find that the time
of massive black hole formation and the occupation fraction of black holes are
a function of the host halo mass. By z = 5, halos with mass M_halo > 3 x 10^9
Msun host massive black holes regardless of the efficiency of seed formation,
while the occupation fraction for smaller halos increases with black hole
formation efficiency. Our simulations explain why massive black holes are found

that finding by deriving the dynamical mass of such a compact quiescent galaxy
at z=1.8. We have obtained a high-quality spectrum with full UV-NIR wavelength
coverage of galaxy NMBS-C7447 using X-Shooter on the VLT. We determined a
velocity dispersion of 294 +- 51 km/s. Given this velocity dispersion and the
effective radius of 1.64 +- 0.15 kpc (as determined from HST-WFC3 F160W
observations) we derive a dynamical mass of 1.7 +- 0.5 x 10^11 Msun. Comparison
of the full spectrum with stellar population synthesis models indicates that
NMBS-C774 has a relatively young stellar population (0.40 Gyr) with little or
no star formation and a stellar mass of ~1.5 x 10^11 Msun. The dynamical and
photometric stellar mass are in good agreement. Thus, our study supports the
conclusion that the mass densities of quiescent galaxies were indeed higher at
earlier times, and this earlier result is not caused by systematic measurement
errors. By combining available spectroscopic measurements at different
redshifts, we find that the velocity dispersion at fixed dynamical mass was a
factor of ~1.8 higher at z=1.8 compared to z=0. Finally, we show that the
apparent discrepancies between the few available velocity dispersion
measurements at z>1.5 are consistent with the intrinsic scatter of the

broad absorption lines and have blue UV/optical continua, suggesting they are

intrinsic X-ray absorption. Our radio-quiet PHL 1811 analogs support a
connection between an X-ray weak spectral energy distribution and PHL 1811-like
UV emission lines; this connection provides an economical way to identify X-ray
weak type 1 quasars. The fraction of radio-quiet PHL 1811 analogs in the

correlations between relative X-ray brightness and UV emission-line properties

radio-quiet PHL 1811 analogs appear to be a subset (~30%) of radio-quiet
weak-line quasars. The existence of a subset of quasars in which

bias-modulation method of McDonald & Seljak allows one to distinguish the
real-space galaxy clustering from the peculiar velocity signal in each Fourier
mode. The ratio of lensing signal to galaxy clustering in transverse modes
yields the bias factor b of each galaxy subset (as per Pen 2004), hence
calibrating the conversion from galaxy real-space density to matter density in
every mode. In combination these techniques permit measure of the growth rate f
in each Fourier mode. This yields a measure of the growth rate free of sample
variance, i.e. the uncertainty in f can be reduced without bound by increasing
the number of redshifts within a finite volume. In practice, the gain from the
absence of sample variance is bounded by the limited range of bias modulation
among dark-matter halos. Nonetheless, the addition of background weak lensing
data to a redshift survey increases information on G and f by an amount
equivalent to a 10-fold increase in the volume of a standard redshift-space
distortion measurement---if the lensing signal can be measured to sub-percent
accuracy. This argues that a combined lensing and redshift survey over a common
low-redshift volume is a more powerful test of general relativity than an
isolated redshift survey over larger volume at high redshift. An example case
is that a survey of ~10^6 redshifts over half the sky in the redshift range
$z=0.5\pm 0.05$ can determine the growth exponent \gamma for the model
$f=\Omega_m^\gamma$ to an accuracy of $\pm 0.015$, using only modes with

Taking the general properties of rings around the gas giants in the Solar
System, we infer the likely properties of rings around exoplanets that reside
inside the ice line. Due to their proximity to their host star, rings around
such exoplanets must primarily consist of rocky materials. However, we find
that despite the higher densities of rock compared to ice, most of the observed
extrasolar planets with reliable radii measurements have sufficiently large
Roche radii to support rings. For the currently known transiting extrasolar
planets, Poynting-Robertson drag is not effective in significantly altering the
dynamics of individual ring particles over a time span of $10^8$ years provided
that they exceed about 1 m in size. In addition, we show that significantly
smaller ring particles can exist in optically thick rings, for which we find
typical ring lifetimes ranging from a few times $10^6$ to a few times $10^9$
years. Most interestingly, we find that many of the rings could have nontrivial
Laplacian planes due to the increased effects of the orbital quadrupole caused
by the exoplanets' proximity to their host star, allowing a constraint on the
$J_2$ of extrasolar planets from ring observations. This is particular
exciting, since a planet's $J_2$ reveals information about its interior
structure. Furthermore, measurements of an exoplanet's oblateness and of its
$J_2$, from warped rings, would together place limits on its spin period. Based
on the constraints that we have derived for extrasolar rings, we anticipate
that the best candidates for ring detections will come from transit
observations by the Kepler spacecraft of extrasolar planets with semi-major
axes $\sim 0.1$ AU and larger.

detected in the power density spectra of the microquasar XTE J1859+226 obtained
with RXTE. This type of QPO manifests as two peaks with similar amplitudes and
harmonically related centroid frequencies (~3 and ~6 Hz). The amplitude of the
~3 Hz feature varies in anticorrelation with the count rate, by about ~50. The
~6 Hz feature shows a slight increase (~7%) of its amplitude with count rate.
The RMS-spectra of the two peaks are quite different. The ~3 Hz feature is
softer than the other one, and shows a cut-off at an energy of ~6 keV while the
RMS of the 6 Hz increases up to at least 20 keV. We also study the bicoherence,
$b^2(\mu,\nu)$. The values b^2(~3,~3) and b^2(~6,~6) are rather high and
similar to the type C QPOs of GRS 1915+105. By comparison with the latter
source the fact that the bicoherence of the ~3 Hz feature is higher than that
of the other peak, would tend to indicate that the ~3 Hz is the fundamental
QPO. The value of b^2(~3,~6)$ is, however, low and therefore indicates a
behavior that is different than that seen in GRS 1915+105. We suggest that,

would be pair produced at the LHC. We show that if such a quark with a mass in
the phenomenologically interesting range of 400 GeV--600 GeV decays to a light
quark and a W-boson, it will produce a signal in a number of channels which can
be seen above the background from the three generation Standard Model
processes. In particular, such quarks could be seen in channels where multiple
jets are present with large missing momentum and either a single hard lepton,
an opposite sign hard lepton pair or a same sign lepton pair.
  In the same sign dilepton channel there is little background and so an excess
of such pairs at large invariant mass will indicate the presence of heavy down
type quarks. More generally, in our study, the main tool we use to determine
the mass of the heavy quark in each of the channels we consider is to use the
kinematics of the decay of such quarks to resolve the momenta of the unobserved
neutrinos. We show how this can be carried out, even in cases where the
kinematics is under-determined by use of the approximation, which holds quite
well, that the two heavy quarks are nearly at rest in the center of mass frame.
  Since it is very likely that at least the lightest heavy quark decays in the
mode we consider, this means that it should be observed at the LHC. Indeed, it
is expected that the mass splitting between the quarks is less than $m_W$ so
that if the Cabbibo-Kobayshi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element between the fourth
and lower generations are not too small, both members of the fourth generation
quark doublet will decay in this way. If this is so, the combined signal of
these two quarks will make the signal for the fourth generation somewhat more
prominent.

an explosion of interest in understanding the rich interplay between

does exist, it is purely incidental and seems to plays no essential role for
the transport efficiency. We emphasize that our paper is not a proof that
entanglement does not exist in light-harvesting complexes - this would require
a knowledge of the system and its parameters well beyond the state of the art.

with n_eff, especially where the lines are optically thick as the linewidths

  The global symmetric function can be interpreted as the generating function

Simple chemical models accounting for the sub-solar N/O ratio suggest that

requires high extinction (A_V > 4), low metallicity may yield reduced dust
shielding and thus a high CO/HCN ratio. The turbulence and structure of GMCs in
M33 are comparable to those found in other systems, so the differences are
unlikely to result from different GMC properties. Since lower CO-to-HCN ratios

constrained search method [M. Levy, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 76, 6062 (1979)].
From the Gibbs inequality one first derives a variational principle for the
grand potential as a functional of a trial many-body distribution. This
functional is minimized in two stages. The first step consists of a constrained
search of all many-body distributions that generate a given one-body density.
The result can be split into internal and external contributions to the total
grand potential. In contrast to the original approach by Mermin and Evans, here
the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional is defined by an explicit
expression that does not refer to an external potential in order to generate
the given one-body density. The second step consists of minimizing with respect
to the one-body density. We show that this framework can be applied in a
straightforward way to the canonical ensemble.

paranematic-nematic and nematic-nematic phase coexistence in binary mixtures of
circular platelets with vanishing thicknesses. An external magnetic field
induces uniaxial alignment and acts on the platelets with a strength that is
taken to scale with the platelet area. At particle diameter ratio lambda=1.5
the system displays paranematic-nematic coexistence. For lambda=2, demixing
into two nematic states with different compositions also occurs, between an
upper critical point and a paranematic-nematic-nematic triple point. Increasing
the field strength leads to shrinking of the coexistence regions. At high
enough field strength a closed loop of immiscibility is induced and phase
coexistence vanishes at a double critical point above which the system is
homogeneously nematic. For lambda=2.5, besides paranematic-nematic coexistence,
there is nematic-nematic coexistence which persists and hence does not end in a
critical point. The partial orientational order parameters along the binodals
vary strongly with composition and connect smoothly for each species when
closed loops of immiscibility are present in the corresponding phase diagram.

physics experiment at the end of this decade. It has an ambitious far-reaching
physics program that spans the most fascinating topics that are emerging in
contemporary hadron physics. The universality of the antiproton annihilation
process, with either protons or nuclei as targets, allows physicists to address
questions like the structure of glueballs and hybrids; to clarify the nature of
the X, Y and Z states; to investigate electromagnetic channels in order to
measure form factors of the nucleon; and to provide theory with input with
respect to non-perturbative aspects of QCD. The possibility to use different
nuclear targets opens the window for charm physics with nuclei or for color
transparency studies, as well as for an intensive hypernuclear physics program.
Previous experimental experience has clearly demonstrated that the key to
success lies in high levels of precision complemented with sophisticated
analysis methods, only possible with high statistics in the data set. However,
since this puts many critical demands on the detector, PANDA's design has
incorporated cutting-edge detector technologies that in some cases have

transport properties in a device consisting of two linear chain leads and a
time-dependent interleads coupling that is switched on non-adiabatically. We
derive a numerically exact expression for the particle current and examine its
characteristics as it evolves in time from the transient regime to the
long-time steady-state regime. We find that just after switch-on the current
initially overshoots the expected long-time steady-state value, oscillates and
decays as a power law, and eventually settles to a steady-state value
consistent with the value calculated using the Landauer formula. The power-law
parameters depend on the values of the applied bias voltage, the strength of
the couplings, and the speed of the switch-on. In particular, the oscillating
transient current decays away longer for lower bias voltages. Furthermore, the
power-law decay nature of the current suggests an equivalent series
resistor-inductor-capacitor circuit wherein all of the components have
time-dependent properties. Such dynamical resistive, inductive, and capacitive
influences are generic in nano-circuites where dynamical switches are
incorporated. We also examine the characteristics of the dynamical current in a
nano-oscillator modeled by introducing a sinusoidally modulated interleads
coupling between the two leads. We find that the current does not strictly
follow the sinusoidal form of the coupling. In particular, the maximum current
does not occur during times when the leads are exactly aligned. Instead, the
times when the maximum current occurs depend on the values of the bias
potential, nearest-neighbor coupling, and the interleads coupling.

turbulence via the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Recent work has shown
that a planetesimal swarm embedded in a fully turbulent disc is subject to
strong excitation of the velocity dispersion, leading to collisional
destruction of bodies with radii R_p < 100 km. Significant diffusion of
planetesimal semimajor axes also arises, leading to large-scale spreading of
the planetesimal population throughout the inner regions of the protoplanetary
disc, in apparent contradiction of constraints provided by the distribution of
asteroids within the asteroid belt. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of
planetesimals embedded in vertically stratified turbulent discs, with and
without dead zones. Our main aims are to examine the turbulent excitation of
the velocity dispersion, and the radial diffusion, of planetesimals in these
discs. We employ three dimensional MHD simulations [...], along with an
equilibrium chemistry model [...] We find that planetesimals in fully turbulent
discs develop large random velocities that will lead to collisional
destruction/erosion for bodies with sizes below 100 km, and undergo radial
diffusion on a scale \sim 2.5 au over a 5 Myr disc life time. But planetesimals
in a dead zone experience a much reduced excitation of their random velocities,
and equilibrium velocity dispersions lie between the disruption thresholds for
weak and strong aggregates for sizes R_p < 100 km. We also find that radial
diffusion occurs over a much reduced length scale \sim 0.25 au over the disc
life time, this being consistent with solar system constraints. We conclude
that planetesimal growth via mutual collisions between smaller bodies cannot
occur in a fully turbulent disc. By contrast, a dead zone may provide a safe
haven in which km-sized planetesimals can avoid mutual destruction through
collisions.

  The first criterion is graph-theoretic and uses Stallings core graphs: given
subgroups of finite rank H \le J \le F_k we present a simple procedure to
determine whether H is a free factor of J. This yields, in particular, a
procedure to determine whether a given element in F_k is primitive.

G, w induces uniform measure on G (for every finite G). This is the second
criterion we investigate: it is not hard to see that primitivity implies
measure preservation and it was conjectured that the two properties are
equivalent. Our combinatorial approach to primitivity allows us to make
progress on this problem and in particular prove the conjecture for k=2.

plasma science to explore a variety of kinetic effects. One major problem is
the long run-time of such simulations. Even on modern computer systems, PIC
codes take a considerable amount of time for convergence. Most of the
computations can be massively parallelized, since particles behave
independently of each other within one time step. Current graphics processing
units (GPUs) offer an attractive means for execution of the parallelized code.
In this contribution we show a one-dimensional PIC code running on Nvidia GPUs
using the CUDA environment. A distinctive feature of the code is that size of
the cells that the code uses to sort the particles with respect to their
coordinates is comparable to size of the grid cells used for discretization of
the electric field. Hence, we call the corresponding algorithm ""fine-sorting"".
Implementation details and optimization of the code are discussed and the
speed-up compared to classical CPU approaches is computed.

around the largest asteroid (153) Hilda. Using N-body numerical simulations we
prove that the Yarkovsky effect (infrared thermal emission from the surface of
asteroids) causes a systematic drift in eccentricity for resonant asteroids,
while their semimajor axis is almost fixed due to the strong coupling with
Jupiter. This is a different mechanism from main belt families, where the
Yarkovsky drift affects basically the semimajor axis. We use the eccentricity
evolution to determine the following ages: (1.7+-0.7) Gyr for the Schubart
family and >~4 Gyr for the Hilda family. We also find that collisionally-born
clusters in the J2/1 resonance would efficiently dynamically disperse. The
steep size distribution of the stable population inside this resonance could
thus make sense if most of these bodies are fragments from an event older than
~1 Gyr. Finally, we test stability of resonant populations during Jupiter's and

whereas the low-temperature beta <--> gamma+gamma' transition around 250 K is
of the first order and leads to a phase separation toward the polymorphs with

structural changes, the magnetic behavior of Na1.5VOPO4F0.5 probed by magnetic
susceptibility, heat capacity, and electron spin resonance measurements is well
described by the regular frustrated square lattice model of the

Nuclear magnetic resonance further reveals the long-range ordering below TN =

suggest that the ordering of Na atoms introduces a large number of inequivalent
exchange couplings that split the square lattice into plaquettes. Additionally,
the direct connection between the vanadium polyhedra induces an unusually
strong interlayer coupling having effect on the transition entropy and the

we define a derived invariant A_Q(L,P)=sup a_X(L,P,z).
  If P_M is such that |P_M|=k, we show that A_Q(L,P_M) is a lower bound for
t(L), where t(L) is the tunnel number of L. If P is a ""boundary partition"" of L
and g(L,P) denotes the infimum among the sums of the genera of a system of
disjoint Seifert surfaces for the L_j's, then we show that A_Q(L,P) is at most
2g(L,P)+2k-|P|-1. We set A_Q(L):=A_Q(L,P_m), where |P_m|=1. By elaborating on a
suitable version of a result by Inoue, we show that when L=K is a knot then
A_Q(K) is bounded above by A(K), where A(K) is the breadth of the Alexander
polynomial of K. However, for every g we exhibit examples of genus-g knots
having the same Alexander polynomial but different quandle invariants A_Q.
Moreover, in such examples A_Q provides sharp lower bounds for the genera of
the knots. On the other hand, A_Q(L) can give better lower bounds on the genus
than A(L), when L has at least two components.
  We show that in order to compute A_Q(L) it is enough to consider only
colorings with respect to the constant labelling z=1. In the case when L=K is a
knot, if either A_Q(K)=A(K) or A_Q(K) provides a sharp lower bound for the knot
genus, or if A_Q(K)=1, then A_Q(K) can be realized by means of the proper
subfamily of quandles X=(F_p,*), where p varies among the odd prime numbers.

reactions at 5.5 MeV/nucleon. Charged products were measured by means of the
$4\pi$ INDRA array. Kinetic-energy spectra and angular distributions of
fragments with atomic number 3 $\le Z \le$ 28 indicate a high degree of
relaxation and are compatible with a fission-like phenomenon. Persistence of
structure effects is evidenced from elemental cross-sections ($\sigma_{Z}$) as
well as a strong odd-even-staggering (o-e-s) of the light-fragment yields. The
magnitude of the staggering does not significantly depend on the neutron
content of the emitting system. Fragment-particle coincidences suggest that the
light partners in very asymmetric fission are emitted either cold or at
excitation energies below the particle emission thresholds. The evaporation
residue cross-section of the $^{78}$Kr + $^{40}$Ca reaction is slightly higher
than the one measured in $^{82}$Kr + $^{40}$Ca reaction. The fission-like
component is larger by $\sim$ 25% for the reaction having the lowest
neutron-to-proton ratio. These experimental features are confronted to the
predictions of theoretical models. The Hauser-Feshbach approach including the
emission of fragments up to $Z$ = 14 in their ground states as well as excited
states does not account for the main features of $\sigma_{Z}$. For both
reactions, the transition-state formalism reasonably reproduces the
$Z$-distribution of the fragments with charge 12 $\le Z \le$ 28. However, this
model strongly overestimates the light-fragment cross-sections and does not
explain the o-e-s of the yields for 6 $\le Z \le$ 10. The shape of the whole
$Z$-distribution and the o-e-s of the light-fragment yields are satisfactorily
reproduced within the dinuclear system framework which treats the competition
between evaporation, fusion-fission and quasifission processes. The model
suggests that heavy fragments come mainly from quasifission while light
fragments are predominantly populated by fusion. An underestimation of the
cross sections for 16 $\le Z \le$ 22 could signal a mechanism in addition to
the capture process.

The lowest order action corresponds to Einstein-Cartan plus a parity-odd term,

the parity-odd term can be identified with the Immirzi parameter of loop
quantum gravity. We compute the quantum effective action in the one-loop
expansion. As in the metric second-order formulation, we find that in the case
of pure gravity the theory is on-shell finite, and the running of Newton's
constant and the Immirzi parameter is inessential. In the presence of fermions,
the situation changes in two fundamental aspects. First, non-renormalizable
logarithmic divergences appear, as usual. Second, the Immirzi parameter becomes
a priori observable, and we find that it is renormalized by a four-fermion
interaction generated by radiative corrections. We compute its beta function
and discuss possible implications. The sign of the beta function depends on
whether the Immirzi parameter is larger or smaller than one in absolute value,
and the values plus or minus one are UV fixed-points (we work in Euclidean
signature). Finally, we find that the Holst action is stable with respect to
radiative corrections in the case of minimal coupling, up to higher order
non-renormalizable interactions.

related to the high matter densities during the accretion phase in
core-collapse SNe of massive iron-core progenitors. The matter suppression
implies that neutrino oscillations will start outside the neutrino transport
region and therefore will have a negligible impact on the neutrino heating and
the explosion dynamics. Furthermore, the possible detection of the next

Mikheyev- Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect in the SN mantle and Earth matter effects,
can reveal the neutrino mass hierarchy in the case that the mixing angle

the MIMO switch controls which stations are connected to which stations. Each

established. In this paper, we focus on ""fair switching"" in which equal amounts
of traffic are to be delivered for all $N(N-1)$ ordered pairs of stations. In
particular, we investigate how the system throughput can be maximized. In
general, for large $N$ the number of possible switch matrices (i.e.,
permutations) is huge, making the scheduling problem combinatorially
challenging. We show that for N=4 and 5, only a subset of $N-1$ switch matrices

conjecture that this will be the case for large $N$ as well. This conjecture,

properties, thus supporting the idea that for most networks, synchronism only
shortcuts asynchronous trajectories. We end with a discussion on the close
relation that apparently exists between sensitivity to synchronism and
non-monotony.

nebulae (PWNe) that give information on the strength and orientation of
magnetic fields. Radio polarimetry gives the degree of order of magnetic
fields, and the orientation of the ordered component. Many young shell
supernova remnants show evidence for synchrotron X-ray emission. The spatial
analysis of this emission suggests that magnetic fields are amplified by one to
two orders of magnitude in strong shocks. Detection of several remnants in TeV
gamma rays implies a lower limit on the magnetic-field strength (or a
measurement, if the emission process is inverse-Compton upscattering of cosmic
microwave background photons). Upper limits to GeV emission similarly provide
lower limits on magnetic-field strengths. In the historical shell remnants,
lower limits on B range from 25 to 1000 microGauss. Two remnants show
variability of synchrotron X-ray emission with a timescale of years. If this
timescale is the electron-acceleration or radiative loss timescale, magnetic
fields of order 1 mG are also implied. In pulsar-wind nebulae, equipartition
arguments and dynamical modeling can be used to infer magnetic-field strengths
anywhere from about 5 microGauss to 1 mG. Polarized fractions are considerably
higher than in SNRs, ranging to 50 or 60% in some cases; magnetic-field
geometries often suggest a toroidal structure around the pulsar, but this is
not universal. Viewing-angle effects undoubtedly play a role. MHD models of
radio emission in shell SNRs show that different orientations of upstream
magnetic field, and different assumptions about electron acceleration, predict
different radio morphology. In the remnant of SN 1006, such comparisons imply a
magnetic-field orientation connecting the bright limbs, with a non-negligible
gradient of its strength across the remnant.

semi-streaming model. The maximum matching problem in the semi-streaming model
has received a significant amount of attention lately. While the problem has
been somewhat well solved for bipartite graphs, the known algorithms for
non-bipartite graphs use $2^{\frac1\epsilon}$ passes or $n^{\frac1\epsilon}$
time to compute a $(1-\epsilon)$ approximation. In this paper we provide the
first FPTAS (polynomial in $n,\frac1\epsilon$) for the problem which is
efficient in both the running time and the number of passes. We also show that
we can estimate the size of the matching in $O(\frac1\epsilon)$ passes using
slightly superlinear space.
  To achieve both results, we use the structural properties of the matching
polytope such as the laminarity of the tight sets and total dual integrality.
The algorithms are iterative, and are based on the fractional packing and
covering framework. However the formulations herein require exponentially many
variables or constraints. We use laminarity, metric embeddings and graph
sparsification to reduce the space required by the algorithms in between and
across the iterations. This is the first use of these ideas in the
semi-streaming model to solve a combinatorial optimization problem.

visible and hidden sectors in generic heterotic string models, generalizing
previous work on orbifold constructions to smooth Calabi-Yau compactifications.
In these theories, genuine sequestering is spoiled by interactions mixing
chiral multiplets of the two sectors in the effective Kahler potential. These
effective interactions however have a specific current-current-like structure
and can be interpreted from an M-theory viewpoint as coming from the exchange
of heavy vector multiplets. One may then attempt to inhibit the emergence of
generic soft scalar masses in the visible sector by postulating a suitable
global symmetry in the dynamics of the hidden sector. This mechanism is however
not straightforward to implement, because the structure of the effective
contact terms and the possible global symmetries is a priori model dependent.
To assess whether there is any robust and generic option, we study the full
dependence of the Kahler potential on the moduli and the matter fields. This is
well known for orbifold models, where it always leads to a symmetric scalar
manifold, but much less understood for Calabi-Yau models, where it generically
leads to a non-symmetric scalar manifold. We then examine the possibility of an
effective sequestering by global symmetries, and argue that whereas for
orbifold models this can be put at work rather naturally, for Calabi-Yau models
it can only be implemented in rather peculiar circumstances.

originally expressed for the sole gravitational interaction in a single fluid
are here generalized to the case of a three quantum fermion fluid duly taking
into account the strong, electromagnetic, weak and gravitational interactions.
The set of constitutive equations including the Einstein-Maxwell-Thomas-Fermi
equations as well as the ones corresponding to the strong interaction
description are here presented in the most general relativistic isothermal
case. This treatment represents an essential step to correctly formulate a
self-consistent relativistic field theoretical approach of neutron stars.

computational complexity, contrasted with the standard quadratic time
agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. We apply the Baire distance to
spectrometric and photometric redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
using, in this work, about half a million astronomical objects. We want to know
how well the (more cos\ tly to determine) spectrometric redshifts can predict
the (more easily obtained) photometric redshifts, i.e. we seek to regress the
spectrometric on the photometric redshifts, and we develop a clusterwise
nearest neighbor regression procedure for this.

forcing and both linear and nonlinear dissipation. Quintic nonlinearity results
in multiple collapse events randomly distributed in space and time forming
forced turbulence. Without dissipation each of these collapses produces finite
time singularity but dissipative terms prevents actual formation of
singularity. In statistical steady state of the developed turbulence the
spatial correlation function has a universal form with the correlation length
determined by the modulational instability scale. The amplitude fluctuations at
that scale are nearly-Gaussian while the large amplitude tail of probability
density function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian with power-like behavior. The
small amplitude nearly-Gaussian fluctuations seed formation of large collapse
events. The universal spatio-temporal form of these events together with the
PDF for their maximum amplitudes define the power-like tail of PDF for large
amplitude fluctuations, i.e., the intermittency of strong turbulence.
