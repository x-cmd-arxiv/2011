ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In
addition to the Bogoliubov mode, this superfluid phase has two spin
excitations, namely, the gapless transverse spin wave and the quadrupolar mode
with a finite excitation gap. In the mean-field theory at T=0, we examine how
these collective modes tunnel through a barrier potential that couples to the
local density of particles. In the presence of supercurrent with a finite
momentum $q$, while the Bogoliubov mode shows the so-called anomalous tunneling
behavior (which is characterized by perfect transmission) in the low energy
limit, the transverse spin-wave transmits perfectly only when the momentum $k$
of this mode coincides with $\pm q$. At $k=\pm q$, the wave function of this
spin wave has the same form as the condensate wave function in the current
carrying state, so that the mechanism of this perfect transmission is found to
be the same as tunneling of supercurrent. Using this fact, the perfect
transmission of the spin wave is proved for a generic barrier potential. We
show that such perfect transmission does not occur in the quadrupolar mode.
Further, we consider the effects of potentials breaking U(1) and spin rotation
symmetries on the transmission properties of excitations. Our results would be
useful for understanding excitation properties of spinor BECs, as well as the
anomalous tunneling phenomenon in Bose superfluids.

achieve a scalable machine. Typically, photons are utilized to generate remote
entanglement between optically active matter qubits. In this paper, we consider
another possibility for achieving entanglement between nodes: using mobile
electron spins as mediators of the interaction between static qubits at each
node. A strong interaction between electrons makes it feasible to couple the
flying electron with the static electron. However, since the electrons easily
interact with the environment, error accumulation during the entanglement

that a high fidelity entanglement operation can be constructed even under the

cooperation (CIFC-UDC) is a cognitive interference channel (CIFC) where the
cognitive (secondary) destination not only decodes the information sent from
its sending dual but also helps enhance the communication of the primary user.
This channel model is an extension of the original CIFC to achieve a win-win
solution under the coexistence condition. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the CIFC-UDC comprises a broadcast channel (BC), a relay channel
(RC) and a partially cooperative relay broadcast channel (PCRBC), and can be
degraded to any one of them. Our main result is the establishment of a new
unified achieva-ble rate region for the CIFC-UDC which is the largest known to
date and can be explicitly shown to include the previous result proposed by Chu
and the largest known rate regions for the BC, the RC and the PCRBC. In
addition, an interesting viewpoint on the unidirectional destination
cooperation in the CIFC-UDC is discussed: to enable the decoder of the primary
user to perform interference mitigation can be considered as a complementary
idea to the interference mitigation via Gel'fand-Pinsker precod-ing in the CIFC
proposed by Devroye et al. Henceforth, by com-bing these two ideas, the
interferences caused at both the desti-nations can be alleviated. Lastly, an
outer bound is presented and proved to be tight for a class of the CIFC-UDC,

sweeping $\nu_6$ secular resonance during the epoch of planetesimal-driven
giant planet migration in the early history of the solar system. We derive
analytical expressions for the magnitude of the eccentricity change and its
dependence on the sweep rate and on planetary parameters; the $\nu_6$ sweeping
leads to either an increase or a decrease of eccentricity depending on an
asteroid's initial orbit. Based on the slowest rate of $\nu_6$ sweeping that
allows a remnant asteroid belt to survive, we derive a lower limit on Saturn's
migration speed of $\sim0.15\AU\My^{-1}$ during the era that the $\nu_6$
resonance swept through the inner asteroid belt (semimajor axis range
2.1--$2.8\AU$). This rate limit is for Saturn's current eccentricity, and
scales with the square of Saturn's eccentricity; the limit on Saturn's
migration rate could be lower if Saturn's eccentricity were lower during its
migration. Applied to an ensemble of fictitious asteroids, our calculations
show that a prior single-peaked distribution of asteroid eccentricities would
be transformed into a double-peaked distribution due to the sweeping of the
$\nu_6$. Examination of the orbital data of main belt asteroids reveals that
the proper eccentricities of the known bright ($H \leq10.8$) asteroids may be
consistent with a double-peaked distribution. If so, our theoretical analysis
then yields two possible solutions for the migration rate of Saturn and for the
dynamical states of the pre-migration asteroid belt: a dynamically cold state
(single-peaked eccentricity distribution with mean of $\sim0.05$) linked with
Saturn's migration speed $\sim 4\AU\My^{-1}$, or a dynamically hot state
(single-peaked eccentricity distribution with mean of $\sim0.3$) linked with

The decay of the average energy of the particles, which is observed for a large

described using scaling arguments. Since this system exhibits unlimited energy
growth in the absence of dissipation, our results for the dissipative case give
support to the principle that Fermi acceleration seem not to be a structurally

reviewed with the ambition of dispelling myths of such charges being affected

purposes, the net charge at such interfaces is defined by the counting of
discrete electrons and core ion charges, and by the definition of the reference
polarisation of the separate, unperturbed bulk materials. The arguments are
illustrated for the case of a thin film of LaAlO$_3$ over SrTiO$_3$ in the
absence of free carriers, for which the net charge is exactly 0.5$e$ per
interface formula unit, if the polarisation response in both materials is
referred to zero bulk values. Further consequences of the argument are
extracted for structural and chemical alterations of such interfaces, in which
internal rearrangements are distinguished from extrinsic alterations (changes
of stoichiometry, redox processes), only the latter affecting the interfacial
net charge. The arguments are reviewed alongside the proposal of Stengel and
Vanderbilt [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 80}, 241103 (2009)] of using formal polarisation
values instead of net interfacial charges, based on the interface theorem of
Vanderbilt and King-Smith [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 48}, 4442 (1993)]. Implications
for non-centrosymmetric materials are discussed, as well as for interfaces for

they are intrinsically connected. For the diffusion process, we can derive the

than a dozen of metal-rich white dwarfs (WDs) suggest that pollution of these
stars with metals may be caused by accretion of high-Z material from the disk.
But the mechanism responsible for efficient transfer of mass from a particulate
disk to the WD atmosphere has not yet been identified. Here we demonstrate that
radiation of the WD can effectively drive accretion of matter through the disk
towards the sublimation radius (located at several tens of WD radii), where
particles evaporate, feeding a disk of metal gas accreting onto the WD. We show
that, contrary to some previous claims, Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag on the
debris disk is effective at providing metal accretion rate $\dot M_{PR}\sim
10^8$ g/s and higher, scaling quadratically with WD effective temperature. We
compare our results with observations and show that, as expected, no WD hosting
a particulate debris disk shows evidence of metal accretion rate below that
produced by the PR drag. Existence of WDs accreting metals at rates
significantly higher than $\dot M_{PR}$ suggests that another mechanism in
addition to PR drag drives accretion of high-Z elements in these systems.

The Lyman Alpha (Lya) emission line is robustly predicted to be the most
prominent intrinsic spectral feature of these galaxies, making it an ideal
target to search for and study high-redshift galaxies. I briefly discuss why
Lya emitting galaxies (LAEs) provide a good probe of the intergalactic medium
(IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). I argue that if we wish to fully
exploit LAEs as a probe of the EoR, it is important to understand what drives
their observed redshift evolution after reionization is completed. One
important uncertainty in interpreting existing LAE observations relates to the
impact of the ionized IGM on Lya photons emitted by galaxies, which is strongly
connected to the effects of scattering through HI in galactic outflows.
Scattering through galactic outflows can also modify the Lya spectral line
shape such that > 5% of the emitted Lya radiation is transmitted directly to
the observer, even through a fully neutral IGM. Finally, I discuss what is
required --observationally and theoretically-- to resolve the uncertainties
that affect existing interpretations of data on LAEs.

of chiral symmetry in a self-consistent manner: One obtains either all these

cryptographic secrecy. Toward that end, we present the secrecy metric of
degrees of freedom in an attacker's knowledge of the cryptogram, which is
similar to equivocation. Using this notion of secrecy, we show how a specific
practical channel coding system can be used to hide information about the
ciphertext, thus increasing the difficulty of cryptographic attacks. The system
setup is the wiretap channel model where transmitted data traverse through
independent packet erasure channels with public feedback for authenticated ARQ
(Automatic Repeat reQuest). The code design relies on puncturing nonsystematic
low-density parity-check codes with the intent of inflicting an eavesdropper
with stopping sets in the decoder. Furthermore, the design amplifies errors
when stopping sets occur such that a receiver must guess all the channel-erased
bits correctly to avoid an expected error rate of one half in the ciphertext.
We extend previous results on the coding scheme by giving design criteria that
reduces the effectiveness of a maximum-likelihood attack to that of a
message-passing attack. We further extend security analysis to models with
multiple receivers and collaborative attackers. Cryptographic security is
enhanced in all these cases by exploiting properties of the physical-layer. The
enhancement is accurately presented as a function of the degrees of freedom in
the eavesdropper's knowledge of the ciphertext, and is even shown to be present
when eavesdroppers have better channel quality than legitimate receivers.

found to be greatly reduced by relativistic precession, which limits the

momenta. Penetration of this ""Schwarzschild barrier"" does occasionally occur,
resulting in capture of stars onto orbits that gradually inspiral due to
gravitational wave emission; we discuss two mechanisms for barrier penetration

these white dwarfs must be currently accreting material containing heavy
elements. Here, we consider whether the scattering of comets or asteroids from
an outer planetary system, following stellar mass loss on the asymptotic giant
branch, can reproduce these observations. We use N-body simulations to
investigate the effects of stellar mass loss on a simple system consisting of a
planetesimal belt whose inner edge is truncated by a planet. Our simulations
find that, starting with a planetesimal belt population fitted to the observed
main sequence evolution, sufficient mass is scattered into the inner planetary
system to explain the inferred heavy element accretion rates. This assumes that
some fraction of the mass scattered into the inner planetary system ends up on
star-grazing orbits, is tidally disrupted and accreted onto the white dwarf.
The simulations also reproduce the observed decrease in accretion rate with
cooling age and predict accretion rates in old (>1Gyr) white dwarfs, in line
with observations. The efficiency we assumed for material scattered into the
inner planetary system to end up on star-grazing orbits is based on a
Solar-like planetary system, since the simulations show that a single planet is
not sufficient. Although the correct level of accretion is reproduced, the
simulations predict a higher fraction of accreting white dwarfs than observed.
This could indicate that evolved planetary systems are less efficient at
scattering bodies onto star-grazing orbits or that dynamical instabilities
post-stellar mass loss cause rapid planetesimal belt depletion for a
significant fraction of systems.

galaxy and halo mass for central galaxies, and the richer merger history of
more massive systems naturally give rise to a strong correlation between galaxy
mass and morphology, and between halo mass and morphological type of central
galaxies. Large fractions of the bulge mass are acquired through major and
minor mergers, but disc instability plays an important role, particularly for
intermediate mass galaxies. We find that the modelling of disc instability
events, as well as of the galaxy merger times, can affect significantly the
timing of bulge formation, and the relative importance of different channels.
Bulge dominated galaxies acquire their morphology through major mergers, but
this can be modified by cooling of gas from the surrounding hot halo. We find
that disc regrowth is a non negligible component of the evolution of bulge
dominated galaxies, particularly for low to intermediate masses, and at high
redshifts.

important and dissipation efficiencies ranging over four orders of magnitude

close to their stars has made it clear that the estimates of the tidal quality
factor, Q, of the stars based on Jupiter and its satellite system and on main
sequence binary star observations are too low, resulting in lifetimes for the

spin periods much longer than the extrasolar planets' orbital period. We
address the problem by applying our own values for the dissipation efficiency

stellar-like convection. The range of dissipation we find for main-sequence
stars corresponds to stellar $Q_*$ of $10^8$ to $3{\times}10^9$. The derived
orbit lifetimes are comparable to, or much longer than the ages of the observed

focus on the relative contribution of various physical mechanisms responsible
for bulge assembly in a Lambda-CDM cosmology. We find that the fraction of
bulgeless galaxies is a strong decreasing function of stellar mass: they
represent a negligible fraction of the galaxy population with M* > 10^12 Msun,
but dominate at M* < 10^10 Msun. We find a clear dichotomy in this galaxy
population, between central galaxies of low-mass dark matter haloes, and
satellite galaxies in massive groups/clusters. We show that bulgeless galaxies
are relatively young systems, that assemble most of their mass at low-redshift,
but they can also host very old stellar populations. Since galaxy-galaxy
mergers are assumed to lead to the formation of a spheroidal component, in our
models these galaxies form preferentially in low-mass haloes that host a small
number of satellites galaxies. We show that the adopted modelling for galaxy
mergers represents a key ingredient in determining the actual number of
bulgeless galaxies. Our results show that these galaxies are not a rare

catalogue is used to measure the luminosity functions for disk and spheroid
white dwarfs, using strict velocity cuts to isolate subsamples belonging to
each population. Disk luminosity functions measured in this manner are really a
conglomerate of thin and thick disk objects, due to the significant velocity
overlap between these populations. We introduce a new statistical approach to
the stellar luminosity function for nearby objects that succesfully untangles
the contributions from the different kinematic populations, without the need
for stringent velocity cuts. This improves the statistical power by allowing
all stars to contribute to the luminosity function, even at tangential
velocities where the populations are indistinguishable. This method is
particularly suited to white dwarfs, for which population discrimination by
chemical tagging is not possible. We use this technique to obtain the first
measurement of the thick disk white dwarf luminosity function, while also
improving constraint on both the thin disk and spheroid luminosity functions.
We find that the thin disk, thick disk and spheroid populations contribute to

winning buyer in turn develops this resource to generate profit. Two forms of
payment are considered: charging the winning buyer a one-time payment, or an
initial payment plus a profit sharing contract (PSC). We consider a symmetric
interdependent values model with risk averse or risk neutral buyers and a risk
neutral seller. For the second price auction and the English auction, we show
that the seller's expected total revenue from the auction where he also takes a
fraction of the positive profit is higher than the expected revenue from the
auction with only a one-time payment. Moreover, the seller can generate an even
higher expected total revenue if, in addition to taking a fraction of the
positive profit, he also takes the same fraction of any loss incurred from
developing the resource. Moving beyond simple PSCs, we show that the auction
with a PSC from a very general class generates higher expected total revenue
than the auction with only a one-time payment. Finally, we show that suitable
PSCs provide higher expected total revenue than a one-time payment even when
the incentives of the winning buyer to develop the resource must be addressed
by the seller.

We
consider the problem of predicting the signal in the interval $T<t\leq T+t_{f}$
from a knowledge of its history and nothing more. We ask the following
question: what is the largest value of $t_{f}$ for which a prediction can be
made? We show that the answer to this question is contained in a fundamental
result of information theory due to Wyner, Ziv, Ornstein, and Weiss. In
particular, for the class of chaotic signals, the upper bound is
$t_{f}\leq\log_{2}T/H$ in the limit $T\rightarrow\infty$, with $H$ being
entropy in a sense that is explained in the text.
  If $\bigl|x(T-s)-x(t^{\ast}-s)\bigr|$ is small for $0\leq s\leq\tau$, where
$\tau$ is of the order of a characteristic time scale, the pattern of events
leading up to $t=T$ is similar to the pattern of events leading up to
$t=t^{\ast}$. It is reasonable to expect $x(t^{\ast}+t_{f})$ to be a good
predictor of $x(T+t_{f}).$ All existing methods for prediction use this idea in
some way or the other. Unfortunately, this intuitively reasonable idea is
fundamentally deficient and all existing methods fall well short of the
Wyner-Ziv entropy bound on $t_{f}$. An optimal predictor should decompose the
distance between the pattern of events leading up to $t=T$ and the pattern
leading up to $t=t^{\ast}$ into stable and unstable components. A good match
should have suitably small unstable components but will in general allow stable
components which are as large as the tolerance for correct prediction. For the
special case of hyperbolic toral automorphisms, we derive an optimal predictor
using Pade approximation.

difference formula approximates the $m$-th derivative $f^{(m)}(0)$ as $\sum
w_{k}f(z_{k})$, with $w_{k}$ being the weights. We derive an algorithm for
finding the weights $w_{k}$ which is an improvement of an algorithm of Fornberg
(\emph{Mathematics of Computation}, vol. 51 (1988), p. 699-706). This algorithm
uses fewer arithmetic operations than that of Fornberg by a factor of
$4/(5m+5)$ while being equally accurate. The algorithm that we derive computes
finite difference weights accurately even when $m$, the order of the
derivative, is as high as 16. In addition, the algorithm generalizes easily to
the efficient computation of spectral differentiation matrices.
  The order of accuracy of the finite difference formula for $f^{(m)}(0)$ with
grid points $hz_{k}$, $1\leq k\leq N$, is typically $\mathcal{O}(h^{N-m})$.
However, the most commonly used finite difference formulas have an order of
accuracy that is higher than the typical. For instance, the centered difference
approximation $(f(h)-2f(0)+f(-h))/h^{2}$ to $f""(0)$ has an order of accuracy
equal to 2 not 1. Even unsymmetric finite difference formulas can exhibit such
superconvergence or boosted order of accuracy, as shown by the explicit
algebraic condition that we derive. If the grid points are real, we prove a
basic result stating that the order of accuracy can never be boosted by more
than 1.

high-throughput multicast. Projection analysis - a recently introduced
technique - shows that the distributed packetized RLNC protocol achieves
(order) optimal and perfectly pipelined information dissemination in many
settings. In the original approach to RNLC intermediate nodes code together all
available information. This requires intermediate nodes to keep considerable
data available for coding. Moreover, it results in a coding complexity that
grows linearly with the size of this data. While this has been identified as a
problem, approaches that combine queuing theory and network coding have
heretofore not provided a succinct representation of the memory needs of
network coding at intermediates nodes.
  This paper shows the surprising result that, in all settings with a
continuous stream of data, network coding continues to perform optimally even
if only one packet per node is kept in active memory and used for computations.
This leads to an extremely simple RLNC protocol variant with drastically
reduced requirements on computational and memory resources. By extending the
projection analysis, we show that in all settings in which the RLNC protocol
was proven to be optimal its finite memory variant performs equally well. In
the same way as the original projection analysis, our technique applies in a
wide variety of network models, including highly dynamic topologies that can
change completely at any time in an adversarial fashion.

Sun Paradox (FYSP). Lower solar luminosity in the past means that less energy
was absorbed on Earth (a forcing of -50 Wm-2 during the late Archean), but
geological evidence points to the Earth being at least as warm as it is today,
with only very occasional glaciations. We perform radiative calculations on a
single global mean atmospheric column. We select a nominal set of three
layered, randomly overlapping clouds, which are both consistent with observed
cloud climatologies and reproduce the observed global mean energy budget of
Earth. By varying the fraction, thickness, height and particle size of these
clouds we conduct a wide exploration of how changed clouds could affect
climate, thus constraining how clouds could contribute to resolving the FYSP.
Low clouds reflect sunlight but have little greenhouse effect. Removing them
entirely gives a~forcing of +25 Wm-2 whilst more modest reduction in their
efficacy gives a forcing of +10 to +15 Wm-2. For high clouds, the greenhouse
effect dominates. It is possible to generate +50 Wm-2 forcing from enhancing
these, but this requires making them 3.5 times thicker and 14 K colder than the
standard high cloud in our nominal set and expanding their coverage to 100% of
the sky. Such changes are not credible. More plausible changes would generate
no more that +15 Wm-2 forcing. Thus neither fewer low clouds nor more high
clouds can provide enough forcing to resolve the FYSP. Decreased surface albedo
can contribute no more than +5 Wm-2 forcing. Some models which have been
applied to the FYSP do not include clouds at all. These overestimate the
forcing due to increased CO2 by 20 to 25% when CO2 is 0.01 to 0.1 bar.

analytically using a continuum model and a Green's function approach. We show
that the temperatures reached in nanowires can be much lower than that
predicted by bulk models of Joule heating, due to heat loss at the nanowire
surface that is important at nanoscopic dimensions, even when the thermal
conductivity of the environment is relatively low. In addition, we find that
the maximum temperature in the nanowire scales weakly with length, in contrast
to the bulk system. A simple criterion is presented to assess the importance of
these effects. The results have implications for the experimental measurements
of nanowire thermal properties, for thermoelectric applications, and for
controlling thermal effects in nanowire electronic devices.

broadcast channel with feedback is presented and analyzed using tools from the
theory of linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control. It is shown that the
performance of this code depends on the noise correlation at the receivers and
it is related to the solution of a discrete algebraic Riccati equation. For the
case of independent noises, the sum rate achieved by the proposed code,
satisfying average power constraint P, is characterized as 1/2 log (1+P*phi),
where the coefficient ""phi"" in the interval [1,k] quantifies the power gain due
to the presence of feedback. When specialized to the case of two receivers,
this includes a previous result by Elia and strictly improves upon the code of
Ozarow and Leung. When the noises are correlated, the pre-log of the
sum-capacity of the broadcast channel with feedback can be strictly greater
than one. It is established that for all noise covariance matrices of rank r
the pre-log of the sum capacity is at most k-r+1 and, conversely, there exists
a noise covariance matrix of rank r for which the proposed code achieves this
upper bound. This generalizes a previous result by Gastpar and Wigger for the
two-receiver broadcast channel.

Ionization instability is well established as a mechanism of X-ray novae
eruptions in black hole binary systems but its applicability to AGN is still
problematic. Radiation pressure theory has still very weak observational
background in any of these sources. In the present paper we attempt to confront
the parameter space of these instabilities with the observational data. At the
basis of this simple survey of sources properties we argue that the radiation
pressure instability is likely to be present in several Galactic sources with
the Eddington ratios above 0.15, and in AGN with the Eddington ratio above
0.025. Our results favor the parameterization of the viscosity through the
geometrical mean of the radiation and gas pressure both in Galactic sources and
AGN. More examples of the quasi-regular outbursts in the timescales of 100
seconds in Galactic sources, and hundreds of years in AGN are needed to
formulate firm conclusions. We also show that the disk sizes in the X-ray novae
are consistent with the ionization instability. This instability may also
considerably influence the lifetime cycle and overall complexity in the

coupling on the phase diagram within a two-plus-one-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) model under the charge-neutrality and $\beta$-equilibrium constraints. We
find that when such constraints are imposed, the new anomaly term plays a quite
similar role as the vector interaction does on the phase diagram, which the
present authors clarified in a previous work. Thus, there appear several types
of phase structures with multiple critical points at low temperature $T$,
although the phase diagrams with intermediate-$T$ critical point(s) are never
realized without these constraints even within the same model Lagrangian. This
drastic change is attributed to an enhanced interplay between the chiral and
diquark condensates due to the anomaly term at finite temperature; the u-d
diquark coupling is strengthened by the relatively large chiral condensate of
the strange quark through the anomaly term, which in turn definitely leads to
the abnormal behavior of the diquark condensate at finite $T$, inherent to the
asymmetric quark matter. We note that the critical point from which the
crossover region extends to zero temperature appears only when the strength of
the vector interaction is larger than a critical value. We also show that the
chromomagnetic instability of the neutral asymmetric homogenous two-flavor
color superconducting(2CSC) phase is suppressed and can be even completely
cured by the enhanced diquark coupling due to the anomaly term and/or by the
vector interaction.

continuous spectrum and is unstable. Physical interpretation of this
instability is that a supermembrane can have a long thin tube without cost of
energy and consequently it becomes a spiky configuration in which multiple
membranes are connected by thin tubes. On the other hand, the ABJM model was
proposed as a low-energy description of multiple M2-branes in the static gauge.
It is natural that an M2-brane is also unstable in this gauge if we believe the
physical picture in the light-cone gauge. In order to examine this, we
construct a BPS solution explicitly both in the Nambu-Goto action of a
supermembrane in the static gauge and in the U(1){\times}U(1) ABJM model, which
represents intersecting M2-branes. Since this configuration is regarded as a
single M2-brane emitting another one, we study the instability of an M2-brane
by analyzing fluctuations around it. We show that a zero mode exists which can
deform the configuration. For comparison, we also examine a similar
configuration on the D2-brane and check that it does not have such zero modes
under a fixed string charge. Furthermore we confirm that the novel Higgs
mechanism translates our BPS solution in the ABJM model into that in the
D2-brane world volume theory, where the winding number of the former around the
fixed point of the orbifold becomes the number of strings ending on the
D2-brane in the latter.

~6x10^33 erg/s), indeed the lowest among non-recycled gamma-ray pulsars. A deep
X-ray observation with Chandra (0.5-10 keV), coupled with sensitive
optical/infrared ground-based images of the field, allowed us to identify PSR
J0357+3205 as a faint source with a soft spectrum, consistent with a purely
non-thermal emission (photon index Gamma=2.53+/-0.25). The absorbing column
(NH=8+/-4x10^20 cm^-2) is consistent with a distance of a few hundred parsecs.
Moreover, the Chandra data unveiled a huge (9 arcmin long) extended feature
apparently protruding from the pulsar. Its non-thermal X-ray spectrum points to
synchrotron emission from energetic particles from the pulsar wind, possibly
similar to other elongated X-ray tails associated with rotation-powered pulsars
and explained as bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). However, energetic
arguments, as well as the peculiar morphology of the diffuse feature associated
with PSR J0357+3205 make the bow-shock PWN interpretation rather challenging.

diffusion that satisfies the semigroup property at a discrete set of time
points $M:=\{\tau_m\,|\,m\in\N_0\}$ and that is in contrast to the classical
diffusion model not smooth. More precisely, if $v$ denotes the concentration of
a substance diffusing with constant speed, then $v$ is continuous but its time
derivative is discontinuous at the discrete set $M$ of time points. It is this
property of diffusion that forbids the classical limit procedure that leads to
the noncausal diffusion model in Stochastics. Furthermore, we show that
diffusion with constant speed satisfies an inhomogeneous wave equation with a
time dependent coefficient.

Pauli group of a qubit-qu$d$it, where $d = 2^{k}$ and an integer $k \geq 2$, is
recast in the language of a finite geometry. A point of such geometry is
represented by the maximum set of mutually commuting elements of the group and
two distinct points are regarded as collinear if the corresponding sets have
exactly $2^{k} - 1$ elements in common. The geometry comprises $2^{k} - 1$
copies of the generalized quadrangle of order two (""the doily"") that form
$2^{k-1} - 1$ pencils arranged into a remarkable nested configuration. This
nested structure reflects the fact that maximum sets of mutually commuting
elements are of two different kinds (ordinary and exceptional) and exhibits an
intriguing alternating pattern: the subgeometry of the exceptional points of
the $(k+2)$-case is found to be isomorphic to the full geometry of the
$k$-case. It should be stressed, however, that these generic properties of the
qubit-qudit geometry were inferred from purely computer-handled cases of $k =
2, 3, 4$ and 5 only and, therefore, their rigorous, computer-free proof for $k
\geq 6$ still remains a mathematical challenge.

compressive MUSIC (CS-MUSIC) or subspace-augumented MUSIC (SA-MUSIC) optimally
combines the compressive sensing (CS) and array signal processing such that
$k-r$ supports are first found by CS and the remaining $r$ supports are
determined by generalized MUSIC criterion, where $k$ and $r$ denote the

heavily depends on the correct identification of $k-r$ partial support by

conditions are relevant to phenomena observed in the solar corona and were
studied earlier by Aulanier et al., A&A 444, 961 (2005). In extension to that
work, we use the technique of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to significantly
enhance the local spatial resolution of the current sheet during its formation,
which enables us to follow the evolution into a later stage. Our simulations
are in good agreement with the results of Aulanier et al. up to the calculated
time in that work. In a later phase, we observe a basically unarrested collapse
of the sheet to length scales that are more than one order of magnitude smaller
than those reported earlier. The current density attains correspondingly larger
maximum values within the sheet. During this thinning process, which is finally
limited by lack of resolution even in the AMR studies, the current sheet moves
upward, following a global expansion of the magnetic structure during the
quasi-static evolution. The sheet is locally one-dimensional and the plasma
flow in its vicinity, when transformed into a co-moving frame, qualitatively
resembles a stagnation point flow. In conclusion, our simulations support the
idea that extremely high current densities are generated in the vicinities of
QSLs as a response to external perturbations, with no sign of saturation.

formulation of general relativity. In the latter theory the local degrees of
freedom of general relativity arise by breaking the gauge invariance of a

the infinite number of degrees of freedom with higher spins similarly arise by
the breaking of a topological theory with an infinite dimensional gauge
symmetry extending $sp(4)$ to the Lorentz algebra.

strong CP problem. To stabilize the Peccei-Quinn scale, we consider mixing
between the messenger fields that communicate the supersymmetry and
Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking to the visible sector. Such mixing leads to the
radiative stabilization of the Peccei-Quinn scale. In the model, a Higgs
coupling to the axion superfield generates the B parameter at the soft mass
scale while a small mu term is induced after the Peccei-Quinn symmetry
breaking. We also explore the phenomenological and cosmological aspects of the
model, which crucially depend on the saxion and axino interactions with the
ordinary particles induced by the Higgs coupling to the axion superfield.

a survey area of 155 arcmin^2. The photometric data include U,B,F606W,F814W,J,K
bands. Morphologies are based on a by eye classification and we distinguish
between 3 basic classes: compact objects, targets with a disc and/or a bulge
component and irregular or merger candidates. The majority of our targets has
either a very compact morphology (33+-6%), or show more or less distinct disc
components (41+-6%). 14+-4% are merger or irregulars and 7 objects could not be
classified. We also study the dependence of structural parameters on
morphological appearance. EROs that are either compact or show a distinct bulge
component have smaller median effective radii (1.22+-0.14 kpc and 3.31+-0.53
kpc) than disc dominated (5.50+-0.51 kpc) or possible irregular galaxies or
merger candidates (4.92+-0.14 kpc). The Sersic index changes from 2.30+-0.34
and 3.24+-0.55, to 1.03+-0.24 and 1.54+-0.40 respectively.
  Most the EROs in our sample have redshifts between z=1 and z=2; however,
compact EROs in our sample are found at redshifts as low as z=0.4 and as high
as z=2.8; the latter qualify as well as DRGs. Disc-like EROs are also found up
to z=2.8; however those with a bulge-disc structure are only seen at z<1.5. For
each of these EROs we determined the stellar mass and mean population age by
fitting synthetic Bruzual (2007) spectra to the SED. Mass estimates were
obtained by assuming an exponentially declining star formation rate. Total
stellar masses are in the range 9.1<log(M/M_sun)<11.6. We cannot detect
significant differences between the stellar mass distribution of the
morphological classes. EROs with masses of log(M/M_sun)>11.0 dominantly show
compact morphologies, but also include a significant number of sources with a
disc morphology.

has undergone a recent outburst in all observed bands, including the optical.
  Aims. In this work we explore the short-term optical variability of 3C 454.3
during its outburst by searching for time delays between different optical
bands. Finding one would be important for understanding the evolution of the
spectrum of the relativistic electrons, which generate the synchrotron jet
emission.
  Methods. We performed photometric monitoring of the object by repeating
exposures in different optical bands (BVRI). Occasionally, different telescopes
were used to monitor the object in the same band to verify the reliability of
the smallest variations we observed.
  Results. Except on one occasion, where we found indications of a lag of the
blue wavelengths behind the red ones, the results are inconclusive for most of
the other cases. There were either no structures in the light curves to be able
to search for patterns, or else different approaches led to different
conclusions.

properties in between those of a viscoplastic solid and those of a viscoelastic

latex particles which are dispersed in water and contain long-chain acrylic

believed to be dominated by the interface regions between the original latex

bulk rheology of a pressure-sensitive adhesive by means of a mesoscale
simulation model. To reach experimental time and length scales, each latex
particle is represented by just one simulated particle. The model is subjected
to oscillatory shear flow and extensional flow. Simple order of magnitude

uncover in both compounds a distinct rearrangement of the antiferromagnetically
ordered Sm-moments near $35-40$~T. This is seen in both, static and pulsed
magnetic fields, as a sharp change in the sign of the magnetic torque, which is
sensitive to the magnetic anisotropy and hence to the magnetic moment in the
$ab$-plane, ({\it i.e.} the FeAs-layers), and as a jump in the magnetization
for magnetic fields perpendicular to the conducting planes. This rearrangement
of magnetic ordering in $35-40$~T is essentially temperature independent and
points towards a canted or a partially polarized magnetic state in high
magnetic fields. However, the observed value for the saturation moment above
this rearrangement, suggests that the complete suppression of the
antiferromagnetism related to the Sm-moments would require fields in excess of
60~T. Such a large field value is particularly remarkable when compared to the
relatively small N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}\simeq5$~K, suggesting very
anisotropic magnetic exchange couplings. At the transition, magnetoresistivity
measurements show a crossover from positive to negative field-dependence,
indicating that the charge carriers in the FeAs planes are sensitive to the
magnetic configuration of the rare-earth elements. This is indicates a finite
magnetic/electronic coupling between the SmO and the FeAs layers which are
likely to mediate the exchange interactions leading to the long range
antiferromagnetic order of the Sm ions.

Bayesian tools instead of the common periodogram analyses. We analyse the

spectrographs using posterior sampling techniques and computation of the

We do not fix the orbital eccentricities and stellar jitter to certain values

take the uncertainties of these parameters into account when assessing the

that based on the Bayesian model probabilities and the nature of the posterior
densities of the different models, there is evidence in favour of four planets
orbiting GJ 581. The HARPS and HIRES data do not imply the conclusion that
there are two additional companions orbiting GJ 581. We also revise the orbital

terms of the order parameter are included to account for inhomogeneities. This
approach incorporates the state-of-the-art knowledge of the homogeneous mixture
with a population imbalance exactly and gives good agreement with the

allows us to calculate the universal surface tension of the interface between
the equal-density superfluid and the partially polarized normal state of the

larger tubular hydrophobic structures appear which, at higher concentration,

due to a debris disk. The disk has been recently imaged from ground and space,

suggest the presence of planetary companions around the star, that remain
undetected in deep adaptive optics imaging. For a better understanding of the
system we aim to refine the determination of the stellar parameters, with
emphasis on the stellar age and system orientation. We used ASAS and Hipparcos
photometry and FEROS spectra to determine the rotation period, radial and
rotational velocity, chromospheric emission, effective temperature, and
chemical composition. We find no indication of any misalignment between the
star rotation axis and the disk. The standard age calibrations applied to
several indicators yield an age close to that of the Pleiades (120 Myr);
however the kinematic properties strongly support its membership in the younger
(40 Myr) Argus association, which also includes the IC 2391 open cluster.
Detailed comparison of the properties of HD 61005 and IC 2391 members shows
that the characteristics of HD 61005 are compatible with membership to the
Argus association, once its rather slow rotation is taken into account, because
lithium and other age indicators are somewhat correlated with stellar rotation
at a fixed age. We also identify systematic differences between the field and
cluster population of the Argus association, which are probably selection
effects, so we suggest that additional members with slower rotation and lower
activity level are waiting to be identified.

thermodynamic system that continuously moves away from equilibrium, driven by
maximum entropy production which materializes in hierarchically coupled
mechanisms of energetic flows via dissipation and physical work. I relate this
view with Kauffman's 'Fourth Law of Thermodynamics', which I interprete as a
proposition about the accumulation of information in evolutionary processes.
The concept of physical work is expanded to including work directed at the
capacity to work: I offer a twofold specification of Kauffman's concept of an
'autonomous agent', one as a 'self-referential heat engine', and the other in
terms of physiosemeiosis, which is a naturalized application of Peirce's theory
of signs. The conjunction of these three theoretical sources, Maximum Entropy,
Kauffman's Fourth Law, and physiosemeiosis, shows that the Kleidon restatement
of the Gaia hypothesis is equivalent to the proposition that the biosphere is
generating, processing and storing information, thus directly treating
information as a physical phenomenon. There is a fundamental ontological
continuity between the biological processes and the human economy, as both are
seen as information processing and entropy producing systems. Knowledge and
energy are not substitutes, with energy and information being two aspects of
the same underlying physical process.

trivial. This contrasts the case of spin-less fermions where standard
localization arguments apply and an Anderson-localized phase pervades the whole
phase diagram. A compressible Bose-glass phase always intrudes between the Mott
insulator with zero (or one) bosons per site and the superfluid that is
stabilized for weak disorder. At half filling, there is a direct transition
between a (gapped) rung-Mott insulator and a Bose glass, which is driven by
exponentially rare regions where disorder is suppressed. Finally, by doping the
rung-Mott insulator, a direct transition to the superfluid is possible only in
the clean system, whereas the Mott phase is always surrounded by the a Bose
glass when disorder is present. The phase diagram based on our numerical

which are expected to yield stretching induced force-peaks in the range of 1
nN. Such high force peaks should be due to forcing of a slip-loop through a
cystine ring, i.e. by generating a cystine slipknot. The survey has been
performed in a simple coarse grained model. Here, we perform all-atom steered
molecular dynamics simulations on 15 cystine knot proteins and determine their
resistance to stretching. In agreement with previous studies within a coarse
grained structure based model, the level of resistance is found to be
substantially higher than in proteins in which the mechanical clamp operates
through shear. The large stretching forces arise through formation of the
cystine slipknot mechanical clamp and the resulting steric jamming. We
elucidate the workings of such a clamp in an atomic detail. We also study the
behavior of five top strength proteins with the shear-based mechanostability in
which no jamming is involved. We show that in the atomic model, the jamming
state is relieved by moving one amino acid at a time and there is a choice in
the selection of the amino acid that advances the first. In contrast, the
coarse grained model also allows for a simultaneous passage of two amino acids.

quantum cluster approaches to lattice models of strongly correlated electrons
with local interactions. By treating the inter-cluster potential, in addition
to the interactions, as a perturbation, it is shown that the CPT can be
reformulated as an all-order re-summation of diagrams within standard
weak-coupling perturbation theory where vertex corrections are neglected. This
reformulation is shown to allow for a straightforward generalization of the CPT
to the general non-equilibrium case using contour-ordered Green's functions.
Solving the resulting generalized CPT equation on the discretized
Keldysh-Matsubara time contour, the transient dynamics of an essentially
arbitrary initial pure or mixed state can be traced. In this way, the
time-dependent expectation values of one-particle observables can be obtained
within an approximation that neglects spatial correlations beyond the extension
of the reference cluster. The necessary computational effort is very moderate.
A detailed discussion and simple test calculations are presented to demonstrate
the strengths and the shortcomings of the proposed approach. The
non-equilibrium CPT is systematic and is controlled in principle by the inverse
cluster size. It interpolates between the non-interacting and the atomic or
decoupled-cluster limit which are recovered exactly and is found to predict the
correct dynamics at very short times in a general non-trivial case. The effects
of initial-state correlations on the subsequent dynamics and the necessity to
extend the Keldysh contour by the imaginary Matsubara branch are analyzed
carefully and demonstrated numerically. It is furthermore shown that the
approach can describe the dissipation of spin and charge to an uncorrelated
bath with an essentially arbitrary number of degrees of freedom.

the available data sets (P, W, alpha and IP), different models of pulsar radio

period and the inclination angles. The best suited parent period distribution
function is the log-normal distribution, although the gamma function
distribution cannot be excluded. The strongest constraint on derived model
distribution functions was the requirement that the numbers of interpulses were
exactly (within 1sigma errors) at the observed level of occurrences. We found
that a suitable model distribution function for the inclination angle is the
complicated trigonometric function which has two local maxima, one near 0 deg

IP occurrence. It is very unlikely that the pulsar beam deviates significantly

that the production of turbulence has a different redshift dependence in the

that turbulence in the ICM is produced chiefly by merger-induced shear flows,
whereas the production in the WHIM is dominated by shock interactions.
Secondly, the effect of dynamical pressure support on the gravitational
contraction has been studied. This turbulent support is stronger in the WHIM
gas at baryon overdensities 1 < delta < 100, and less relevant for the ICM.
Although the relative mass fraction of the gas with large vorticity is
considerable (52% in the ICM), we find that for only about 10% in mass this is
dynamically relevant, namely not associated to an equally large thermal
pressure support. According to this result, a significant non-thermal pressure
support counteracting the gravitational contraction is a localised
characteristic in the cosmic flow, rather than a widespread feature.

tubes created by the strong radial shear at the tachocline. In this scenario,
the magnetic field has to exceed a threshold value before it becomes buoyant
and emerges through the whole convection zone. We follow the evolution of a
random seed magnetic field with the aim of study under what conditions it is
possible to excite the dynamo instability and whether the dynamo generated
magnetic field becomes buoyantly unstable and emerges to the surface as
expected in the flux-tube context. We perform numerical simulations of
compressible turbulent convection that include a vertical shear layer. Like the
solar tachocline, the shear is located at the interface between convective and
stable layers. We find that shear and convection are able to amplify the
initial magnetic field and form large-scale elongated magnetic structures. The
magnetic field strength depends on several parameters such as the shear
amplitude, the thickness and location of the shear layer, and the magnetic
Reynolds number ($\Rm$). Whenever the toroidal magnetic field reaches
amplitudes greater a threshold value which is close to the equipartition value,
it becomes buoyant and rises into the convection zone where it expands and
forms mushroom shape structures. Some events of emergence, i.e. those with the
largest amplitudes of the initial field, are able to reach the very uppermost
layers of the domain. These episodes are able to modify the convective pattern
