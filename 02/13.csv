in single-hadron spectra in heavy-ion collisions. Its angular structure,
leading e.g. to intra-jet correlations, is only known for the one-gluon
inclusive case. In the vacuum, properties such as angular ordering appear when
considering less inclusive distributions due to destructive interference
effects. We present a calculation which takes into account interference effects
in a medium for a setup in which we consider gluon radiation off a
quark-antiquark pair with a given opening angle. Surprisingly, computing the
spectrum at leading-log accuracy we find that an ordering exists which is
exactly opposite from that in the vacuum. We estimate the magnitude of the

the rare population of local galaxies that have properties that are very
similar to distant Lyman Break Galaxies. Our six targets were specifically
selected because they have optical emission-line properties that are
intermediate between starbursts and Type 2 (obscured) AGN. Our new X-ray data
provide an important diagnostic of the presence of an AGN. We find X-ray
luminosities of order 10^{42} erg/s and ratios of X-ray to far-IR luminosities
that are higher than values in pure starburst galaxies by factors ranging from
~ 3 to 30. This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN in at least some of
the galaxies. The ratios of the luminosities of the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray to [O
III]\lambda 5007 emission-line are low by about an order-of-magnitude compared
to Type 1 AGN, but are consistent with the broad range seen in Type 2 AGN.
Either the AGN hard X-rays are significantly obscured or the [O III] emission
is dominated by the starburst. We searched for an iron emission line at ~ 6.4
keV, which is a key feature of obscured AGN, but only detected emission at the
~ 2\sigma level. Finally, we find that the ratios of the mid-infrared (24\mu m)
continuum to [O III]\lambda 5007 luminosities in these LBAs are higher than the
values for Type 2 AGN by an average of 0.8 dex. Combining all these clues, we
conclude that an AGN is likely to be present, but that the bolometric
luminosity is produced primarily by an intense starburst. If these black holes
are radiating at the Eddington limit, their masses would lie in the range of
10^5 to 10^6 M_{sun}. These objects may offer ideal local laboratories to
investigate the processes by which black holes grew in the early universe.

higher clustering strength at higher redshifts. We further estimate the average
total masses of the dark matter haloes hosting these stellar-mass selected
galaxies. For all galaxies in our sample the stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio
is always lower than the universal baryonic mass fraction and the
stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is strongly correlated with the halo masses
for central galaxies, such that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of
their mass in the form of stars. The remaining baryonic mass is included
partially in stars within satellite galaxies in these haloes, and as diffuse
hot and warm gas. We also find that, at a fixed stellar mass, the
stellar-to-total-mass ratio increases at lower redshifts. This suggests that
galaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter haloes,

consequences are immediately relevant to early discovery prospects of
supersymmetry at the LHC. ATLAS and CMS have released their analysis with
35~pb$^{-1}$ of data and the model class we discuss is consistent with this
data. It is shown that with an increase in luminosity the LSP dark matter mass
and the gluino mass can be inferred from simple observables such as kinematic
edges in leptonic channels and peak values in effective mass distributions.
Specifically, we consider cases in which the neutralino is of low mass and
where the relic density consistent with WMAP observations arises via the
exchange of Higgs bosons in unified supergravity models. The magnitudes of the
gaugino masses are sharply limited to focused regions of the parameter space,
and in particular the dark matter mass lies in the range $\sim (50-65) ~\rm
GeV$ with an upper bound on the gluino mass of $575~{\rm GeV}$, with a typical
mass of $450~{\rm GeV}$. We find that all model points in this paradigm are
discoverable at the LHC at $\sqrt s = 7 \rm ~TeV$. We determine lower bounds on
the entire sparticle spectrum in this model based on existing experimental
constraints. In addition, we find the spin-independent cross section for
neutralino scattering on nucleons to be generally in the range of $\sigma^{\rm
SI}_{\na p} = 10^{-46 \pm 1}~\rm cm^2$ with much higher cross sections also
possible. Thus direct detection experiments such as CDMS and XENON already
constrain some of the allowed parameter space of the low mass gaugino models

in the near future.

advertising slots, publishers face new challenges in choosing between the
allocation of contract-based reservation ads and spot market ads. In this
setting, the publisher should take into account the tradeoff between short-term
revenue from an Ad Exchange and quality of allocating reservation ads. In this
paper, we formalize this combined optimization problem as a stochastic control
problem and derive an efficient policy for online ad allocation in settings
with general joint distribution over placement quality and exchange bids. We
prove asymptotic optimality of this policy in terms of any trade-off between
quality of delivered reservation ads and revenue from the exchange, and provide
a rigorous bound for its convergence rate to the optimal policy. We also give
experimental results on data derived from real publisher inventory, showing
that our policy can achieve any pareto-optimal point on the quality vs. revenue
curve. Finally, we study a parametric training-based algorithm in which instead
of learning the dual variables from a sample data (as is done in non-parametric
training-based algorithms), we learn the parameters of the distribution and
construct those dual variables from the learned parameter values. We compare
parametric and non-parametric ways to estimate from data both analytically and
experimentally in the special case without the ad exchange, and show that
though both methods converge to the optimal policy as the sample size grows,
our parametric method converges faster, and thus performs better on smaller
samples.

H and K bands at a resolving power of ~5000 using the near-infrared integral
field spectrometer (NIFS) on the Gemini North 8m telescope. Using recent data
from the Cassini/Huygens mission on the atmospheric composition and surface and
aerosol properties, we develop a multiple-scattering radiative transfer model
for the Titan atmosphere. The Titan spectrum at these wavelengths is dominated
by absorption due to methane with a series of strong absorption band systems
separated by window regions where the surface of Titan can be seen. We use a
line-by-line approach to derive the methane absorption coefficients. The
methane spectrum is only accurately represented in standard line lists down to
~2.1 {\mu}m. However, by making use of recent laboratory data and modeling of
the methane spectrum we are able to construct a new line list that can be used
down to 1.3 {\mu}m. The new line list allows us to generate spectra that are a
good match to the observations at all wavelengths longer than 1.3 {\mu}m and
allow us to model regions, such as the 1.55 {\mu}m window that could not be
studied usefully with previous line lists such as HITRAN 2008. We point out the
importance of the far-wing line shape of strong methane lines in determining
the shape of the methane windows. Line shapes with Lorentzian, and
sub-Lorentzian regions are needed to match the shape of the windows, but
different shape parameters are needed for the 1.55 {\mu}m and 2 {\mu}m windows.
After the methane lines are modelled our observations are sensitive to
additional absorptions, and we use the data in the 1.55 {\mu}m region to
determine a D/H ratio of 1.77 \pm 0.20 x 10-4, and a CO mixing ratio of 50 \pm
11 ppmv. In the 2 {\mu}m window we detect absorption features that can be

populations of CRs accelerated in the test-particle regime. We then compare
them with the results from kinetic DSA simulations for shock waves that are
expected to form in intracluster media and cluster outskirts in the course of
large-scale structure formation. We show that the test-particle solutions
provide a good approximation for the pressure and spectrum of CRs accelerated
at these weak shocks. Since the injection is extremely inefficient at weak
shocks, the pre-existing CR population dominates over the injected population.
If the pressure due to pre-existing CR protons is about 5 % of the gas thermal
pressure in the upstream flow, the downstream CR pressure can absorb typically
a few to 10 % of the shock ram pressure at shocks with the Mach number $M \la
3$. Yet, the re-acceleration of CR electrons can result in a substantial
synchrotron emission behind the shock. The enhancement in synchrotron radiation
across the shock is estimated to be about a few to several for $M \sim 1.5$ and
$10^2-10^3$ for $M \sim 3$, depending on the detail model parameters. The

on three-eighths filling and using the density-matrix renormalization-group

intermediate phase where the Fermi surface is not well defined. The

polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $d$ on $[-1,1]$ through the maximum of its absolute
value on any subset $Z$ of positive measure in $[-1,1]$. It was shown in
\cite{Yom3} that the Lebesgue measure in the Remez inequality can be replaced
by a certain geometric invariant $\omega_d(Z)$ which can be effectively
estimated in terms of the metric entropy of $Z$ and which may be nonzero for
discrete and even finite sets $Z$.
  In the present paper we first obtain an essentially sharp Remez-type
inequality in the spirit of \cite{Yom3} for complex polynomials of one
variable, introducing metric invariants $c_d(Z)$ and $\o_{cd}(Z)$ for an
arbitrary subset $Z\subset D_1\subset {\mathbb C}$. These invariants translate
into the the metric language the classical Cartan lemma (see \cite{Gor} and
references therein).
  Next we introduce $(s,p)$-valent functions, which provide a natural
generalization of $p$-valent ones (see \cite{Hay} and references therein). We
prove a ""distortion theorem"" for such functions, comparing them with
polynomials sharing their zeroes. On this base we extend to $(s,p)$-valent
functions our polynomial Remez-type inequality.
  As the main example we consider restrictions $g$ of polynomials of a growing
degree to a fixed algebraic curve, for which we obtain an essentially sharp
""local"" Remez-type inequality, stressing the role of the geometry of
singularities of $g$.
  Finally, we obtain for such functions $g$ a ""global"" Remez-type inequality
which is valid for all the branches of $g$ and involves both the geometry of
singularities of $g$ and its monodromy.

bounds on the sizes of constant dimension codes which contain a lifted MRD

via Network Utility Maximization (NUM) formulation. Due to stringent QoS
requirements of video streams and specific characterization of utility
experienced by end-users, one has to solve nonconvex and even nonsmooth NUM
formulation for such streams, where dual methods often prove incompetent.
Convexification plays an important role in this work as it permits the use of
existing dual methods to solve an approximate to the NUM problem iteratively
and distributively. Hence, to tackle the nonsmoothness and nonconvexity, we aim
at reformulating the NUM problem through approximation and transformation of
the ideal discretely adaptive utility function for scalable video streams. The
reformulated problem is shown to be a D.C. (Difference of Convex) problem. We
leveraged Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach to replace the nonconvex
D.C. problem by a sequence of convex problems that aim to approximate the
original D.C. problem. We then solve each convex problem produced by SCP
approach using existing dual methods. This procedure is the essence of two
distributed iterative rate control algorithms proposed in this paper, for which
one can show the convergence to a locally optimal point of the nonconvex D.C.
problem and equivalently to a locally optimal point of an approximate to the
original nonconvex problem. Our experimental results show that the proposed
rate control algorithms converge with tractable convergence behavior.

collaboration, in the presence of a social network. Each node in the social
network may be an expert in one or more skills. Edge weights specify affinity
or collaborative compatibility between respective nodes. Given a project that
requires a set of specified number of skilled individuals in each area of
expertise, the goal is to identify a team that maximizes the collaborative
compatibility. For example, the requirement may be to form a team that has at
least three databases experts and at least two theory experts. We explore team
formation where the collaborative compatibility objective is measured as the
density of the induced subgraph on selected nodes. The problem of maximizing
density is NP-hard even when the team requires individuals of only one skill.
We present a 3-approximation algorithm that improves upon a naive extension of
the previously known algorithm for densest at least $k$ subgraph problem. We
further show how the same approximation can be extended to a special case of
multiple skills. Our problem generalizes the formulation studied by Lappas et
al. [KDD '09] who measure team compatibility in terms of diameter or spanning
tree costs. Experiments are performed on a crawl of the DBLP graph where
individuals can be skilled in at most four areas - theory, databases, data
mining, and artificial intelligence. In addition to our main algorithm, we also
present heuristic extensions to trade off between the size of the solution and
its induced density. These density-based algorithms outperform the
diameter-based objective on several metrics for assessing the collaborative
compatibility of teams. The solutions suggested are also intuitively meaningful
and scale well with the increase in the number of skilled individuals required.

inhomogeneity, either of microresistor or of microresonator type. The system
can be modelled by a sine-Gordon equation with a piecewise-constant function to
represent the varying Josephson tunneling critical current. The existence of
pinned fluxons depends on the length of the inhomogeneity, the variation in the
Josephson tunneling critical current and the applied bias current. We establish
that a system may either not be able to sustain a pinned fluxon, or - for
instance by varying the length of the inhomogeneity - may exhibit various
different types of pinned fluxons. Our stability analysis shows that changes of
stability can only occur at critical points of the length of the inhomogeneity
as a function of the (Hamiltonian) energy density inside the inhomogeneity - a
relation we determine explicitly. In combination with continuation arguments
and Sturm-Liouville theory, we determine the stability of all constructed
pinned fluxons. It follows that if a given system is able to sustain at least
one pinned fluxon, there is exactly one stable pinned fluxon, i.e. the system
selects one unique stable pinned configuration. Moreover, it is shown that both
for microresistors and microresonators this stable pinned configuration may be
non-monotonic - something which is not possible in the homogeneous case.
Finally, it is shown that results in the literature on localised
inhomogeneities can be recovered as limits of our results on microresonators.
