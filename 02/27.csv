likely to rapidly decorrelate the network's microstate. The mechanisms involved
in this extreme sensitivity of cortical networks are currently not well

long-term sum of utilities across the video terminals in a decentralized
fashion, by jointly optimizing the packet scheduling, the resource allocation,
and the cooperation decisions, under the assumption that some nodes are willing
to act as cooperative relays. A pricing-based distributed resource allocation
framework is adopted, where the price reflects the expected future congestion
in the network. Specifically, we formulate the wireless video transmission
problem as an MU Markov decision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the
cooperation at the physical layer and the medium access control sublayer, the
video users' heterogeneous traffic characteristics, the dynamically varying
network conditions, and the coupling among the users' transmission strategies
across time due to the shared wireless resource. Although MDPs notoriously
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, our study shows that, with appropriate
simplications and approximations, the complexity of the MU-MDP can be
significantly mitigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that integrating
cooperative decisions into the MU-MDP optimization can increase the resource
price in networks that only support low transmission rates and can decrease the
price in networks that support high transmission rates. Additionally, our
results show that cooperation allows users with feeble direct signals to
achieve improvements in video quality on the order of 5-10 dB peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), with less than 0.8 dB quality loss by users with
strong direct signals, and with a moderate increase in total network energy
consumption that is significantly less than the energy that a distant node
would require to achieve an equivalent PSNR without exploiting cooperative
diversity.

we design a blind adaptive SIC with new multiple access interference
suppression capability implemented within despreading process to improve both
detection and cancellation processes. Furthermore, dynamic scaling factors
derived from the despreader weights are used for interference cancellation
process. This method applied on each subcarrier is followed by maximum ratio or
equal gain combining to fully exploit the frequency diversity inherent in the
multicarrier CDMA systems. It is shown that this way of MAI estimation on

This model takes into account both global effects of H atom perturbations at
the heliospheric boundaries and local (i.e. within 10-20 AU from the Sun)
effects of the solar ionization, charge exchange, solar gravitation and
radiation pressure. Backscattered solar Ly-alpha profiles and their zero, first
and second moments were computed at 1 AU for the anti-solar directions of
line-of-sight. Then the moments are compared with the moments calculated by
using more simplified one-component and two-component hot models. The
comparison shows that the Ly-alpha intensities calculated in the frame of new
model are somewhat smaller than those calculated by means of the simplified
models. Small differences in the first moment (i.e. line-shift) are also
observed in the downwind direction. The largest difference between new model
and hot models is seen in the second moment of the backscattered Ly-alpha
profile. This moment is also called as line-of-sight temperature or line-width
of the backscattered spectra. The spectral width depends on the width of the H
atom velocity distribution function within few AU from the Sun. We show that
the line-widths calculated on the basis of the our model is qualitatively
different from those of simplified models.

to be different, namely a vacuum spark discharge instead of a low pressure
discharge with cascade gas ionization. Also outdated is the theoretical model
developed in Ch. 1 on the ""acceleration of Cooper pairs through the
superconductor"" as a possible basis for the anomalous emission. This naive
representation, however, is useful to show that such an acceleration does not
make sense in a superconductor like YBCO and that the correct picture is that
of (low-voltage) tunnelling of pairs through intrinsic Josephson junctions. The
present paper should therefore be regarded as an ""historical summary"", mainly
valuable as a reference for further developments.

tightly relax any metric interaction potential, while the other one only covers
Euclidean metrics but requires less computational effort. For solving the

Douglas-Rachford scheme, and show that a sequence of dual iterates can be
recovered in order to provide a posteriori optimality bounds. In a quantitative
comparison to two other first-order methods, the approach shows competitive

an improved binarization technique for nonstandard potentials, we were able to
routinely recover discrete solutions within 1%--5% of the global optimum for

the concept of a bisimulation with the recently introduced concept of a uniform

which relate states of two possibly different nondeterministic automata, and
bisimulations ensure compatibility with the transitions, initial and terminal

bisimulations. For each od these three types of bisimulations we provide a
procedure which decides whether there is a bisimulation of this type between
two automata, and when it exists, the same procedure computes the greatest one.
We also show that there is a uniform forward bisimulation between two automata
if and only if the factor automata with respect to the greatest forward
bisimulation equivalences on these automata are isomorphic. We prove a similar
theorem for weak forward bisimulations, using the concept of a weak forward
isomorphism instead of an isomorphism. We also give examples that explain the

model equivalence between various systems, and to reduce the number of states
of these systems, whereas uniform fuzzy relations have recently been introduced
as a means to model the fuzzy equivalence between elements of two possible
different sets. Here we use the conjunction of these two concepts as a powerful
tool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata. We prove that a
uniform fuzzy relation between fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ is a
forward bisimulation if and only if its kernel and co-kernel are forward
bisimulation fuzzy equivalences on $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ and there is a special
isomorphism between factor fuzzy automata with respect to these fuzzy
equivalences. As a consequence we get that fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$
are UFB-equivalent, i.e., there is a uniform forward bisimulation between them,
if and only if there is a special isomorphism between the factor fuzzy automata
of $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ with respect to their greatest forward bisimulation
fuzzy equivalences. This result reduces the problem of testing UFB-equivalence
to the problem of testing isomorphism of fuzzy automata, which is closely
related to the well-known graph isomorphism problem. We prove some similar
results for backward-forward bisimulations, and we point to fundamental
differences. Because of the duality with the studied concepts, backward and
forward-backward bisimulations are not considered separately. Finally, we give
a comprehensive overview of various concepts on deterministic,
nondeterministic, fuzzy, and weighted automata, which are related to
bisimulations.

call metaorders because they are typically split into small pieces and executed
incrementally. Market impact is empirically observed to be a concave function
of metaorder size, i.e., the impact per share of large metaorders is smaller
than that of small metaorders. We formulate a stylized model of an algorithmic
execution service and derive a fair pricing condition, which says that the
average transaction price of the metaorder is equal to the price after trading
is completed. We show that at equilibrium the distribution of trading volume
adjusts to reflect information, and dictates the shape of the impact function.
The resulting theory makes empirically testable predictions for the functional
form of both the temporary and permanent components of market impact. Based on
the commonly observed asymptotic distribution for the volume of large trades,
it says that market impact should increase asymptotically roughly as the square
root of metaorder size, with average permanent impact relaxing to about two
thirds of peak impact.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple concept-driven probabilistic
model for improving text-based rich-media search. While our approach is similar
to existing topic-based retrieval and cluster-based language modeling work,
there are two important differences: (1) our proposed model considers not only
the query-generation likelihood from cluster, but explicitly accounts for the
overall ""popularity"" of the cluster or underlying concept, and (2) we explore
the possibility of inferring the likely concept relevant to a rich-media
content through the user-created communities that the content belongs to.
  We implement two methods of concept extraction: a traditional cluster based
approach, and the proposed community based approach. We evaluate these two
techniques for how effectively they capture the intended meaning of a term from
the content creator and searcher, and their overall value in improving image
search. Our results show that concept-driven search, though simple, clearly
outperforms plain search. Among the two techniques for concept-driven search,
community-based approach is more successful, as the concepts generated from
user communities are found to be more intuitive and appealing.

wireless relaying is investigated. A relay network with multiple
source-destination pairs and multiple relays is considered. All the source
nodes contend through a random access procedure. A winner source node may give
up its transmission opportunity if its link quality is poor. In this research,
we apply the optimal stopping theory to analyze when a winner node should give
up its transmission opportunity. By assuming the winner node has information of
channel gains of links from itself to relays and from relays to its
destination, the existence and uniqueness of an optimal stopping rule are
rigorously proved. It is also found that the optimal stopping rule is a
pure-threshold strategy. The case when the winner node does not have
information of channel gains of links from relays to its destination is also
studied. Two stopping problems exist, one in the main layer (for channel access
of source nodes), and the other in the sub-layer (for channel access of relay
nodes). An intuitive stopping rule, where the sub-layer and the main layer
maximize their throughput respectively, is shown to be a semi-pure-threshold
strategy. The intuitive stopping rule turns out to be non-optimal. An optimal
stopping rule is then derived theoretically. Our research reveals that
multi-user (including multi-source and multi-relay) diversity and time
diversity can be fully utilized in a relay network by our proposed strategies.

faint optical light curve at late time. However, with the inclusion of mid

approximations for the probability of detection of such beams. We conclude that
detection is marginally probable with current telescopes, but that telescopes
that will be operating in the near future, with an appropriate multiyear
observational program, will have a good chance of detecting a beam deflected by

that the magnetic ordering is formed by local moments. The magnetic state is
featured with a huge magnetoresistance and a distinguished Hall resistivity,
\rho_xy(H), which shows a pronounced parabolic field dependence, while the

  Classification -a Non-Probabilistic Approach",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the central problems in the classification of individual test
sequences (e.g. genetic analysis), is that of checking for the similarity of
sample test sequences as compared with a set of much longer training sequences.
This is done by a set of classifiers for test sequences of length N, where each
of the classifiers is trained by the training sequences so as to minimize the
classification error rate when fed with each of the training sequences.
  It should be noted that the storage of long training sequences is considered
to be a serious bottleneck in the next generation sequencing for Genome
analysis
  Some popular classification algorithms adopt a probabilistic approach, by
assuming that the sequences are realizations of some variable-length Markov
process or a hidden Markov process (HMM), thus enabling the imbeding of the
training data onto a variable-length Suffix-tree, the size of which is usually
linear in $N$, the length of the test sequence.
  Despite of the fact that it is not assumed here that the sequences are
realizations of probabilistic processes (an assumption that does not seem to be
fully justified when dealing with biological data), it is demonstrated that
""feature-based"" classifiers, where particular substrings (called ""features"" or
markers) are sought in a set of ""big data"" training sequences may be based on a
universal compaction of the training data that is contained in a set of $t$
(long) individual training sequences, onto a suffix-tree with no more than O(N)
leaves, regardless of how long the training sequence is, at only a vanishing
increase in the classification error rate.

classical field dynamics and the conservation laws for the new gauge theory are
developed. Finally, the theory's Hamiltonian in the axial gauge is expressed by
two times six unconstrained independent canonical variables obeying the usual
Poisson brackets and the positivity of the Hamiltonian is related to a

an algorithm, which we term Isotonic Recursive Partitioning (IRP), for isotonic

solution of progressively smaller ""best cut"" subproblems. This creates a
regularized sequence of isotonic models of increasing model complexity that
converges to the global isotonic regression solution. The models along the
sequence are often more accurate than the unregularized isotonic regression
model because of the complexity control they offer. We quantify this complexity
control through estimation of degrees of freedom along the path. Success of the
regularized models in prediction and IRPs favorable computational properties

  Accepted for publication in TPLP (CUP)",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide an overall description of the Ciao multiparadigm programming
system emphasizing some of the novel aspects and motivations behind its design
and implementation. An important aspect of Ciao is that, in addition to
supporting logic programming (and, in particular, Prolog), it provides the
programmer with a large number of useful features from different programming
paradigms and styles, and that the use of each of these features (including
those of Prolog) can be turned on and off at will for each program module.
Thus, a given module may be using, e.g., higher order functions and
constraints, while another module may be using assignment, predicates, Prolog
meta-programming, and concurrency. Furthermore, the language is designed to be
extensible in a simple and modular way. Another important aspect of Ciao is its
programming environment, which provides a powerful preprocessor (with an
associated assertion language) capable of statically finding non-trivial bugs,
verifying that programs comply with specifications, and performing many types
of optimizations (including automatic parallelization). Such optimizations
produce code that is highly competitive with other dynamic languages or, with
the (experimental) optimizing compiler, even that of static languages, all
while retaining the flexibility and interactive development of a dynamic
language. This compilation architecture supports modularity and separate
compilation throughout. The environment also includes a powerful
auto-documenter and a unit testing framework, both closely integrated with the
assertion system. The paper provides an informal overview of the language and
program development environment. It aims at illustrating the design philosophy
rather than at being exhaustive, which would be impossible in a single journal
paper, pointing instead to previous Ciao literature.

challenge in modern biology. Following the initial publication of the human
genome sequence in 2001, advances in high-throughput measurement technologies
and efficient sharing of research material through community databases have
opened up new views to the study of living organisms and the structure of life.
In this thesis, novel computational strategies have been developed to
investigate a key functional layer of genetic information, the human
transcriptome, which regulates the function of living cells through protein
synthesis. The key contributions of the thesis are general exploratory tools
for high-throughput data analysis that have provided new insights to
cell-biological networks, cancer mechanisms and other aspects of genome
function.
  A central challenge in functional genomics is that high-dimensional genomic
observations are associated with high levels of complex and largely unknown
sources of variation. By combining statistical evidence across multiple
measurement sources and the wealth of background information in genomic data
repositories it has been possible to solve some the uncertainties associated
with individual observations and to identify functional mechanisms that could
not be detected based on individual measurement sources. Statistical learning
and probabilistic models provide a natural framework for such modeling tasks.
Open source implementations of the key methodological contributions have been
released to facilitate further adoption of the developed methods by the
research community.

their rates of occurrence. A case study of Type Ia supernovae illustrates how
to use lightcurves in the cross-identification process. Constraints from

  Atmospheric Layer Thickness","10 pages, 5 PostScript figures, RevTeX4",,,,"astro-ph.IM physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The phase structure function accumulated by two parallel rays after
transmission through a layer of turbulent air is best known by a
proportionality to the 5/3rd power of the lateral distance in the aperture,
derived from an isotropic Kolmogorov spectrum of the refractive index. For a
von-Karman spectrum of the refractive index, a dependence involving a modified
Bessel function of the ratio of the distance over the outer scale is also
known.
  A further standard proposition is a proportionality to the path length
through the atmospheric layer. The manuscript modifies this factor through a
refined calculation of an integral representation of the structure function.
The correction establishes a sub-linearity as the lateral distance grows in
proportion to the layer thickness; it is more important for large than for
small outer scales.

"1103.1651","Xiaolei Zhang","Xiaolei Zhang","The Emergence of Consciousness in the Quantum Universe","12 pages, submitted to the special issue of Journal of Cosmology on
  ""Consciousness in the Universe"", eds. R. Penrose and S. Hameroff",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is argued that human consciousness is likely to have emerged during the
self-consistent evolution of the physical universe, through the gradual
accumulation of biological entities' ability to tap into the intrinsic
non-deterministic potentiality in the global nonequilibrium phase transitions
occurring continually in the quantum universe. Due to the fact that the matter
and energy content participating in these global phase transitions is a
continuum, there are in effect infinite degrees-of-freedom in the substratum,
which invalidate the usual deterministic laws of the mechanical evolution, and
allow chance factors to appear in the emergent properties of resonantly-formed
quantum particles, especially in the acquired phases of their wavefunctions.
Such chance factors, though occurring mostly randomly during the early cosmic
evolution phase, can be harnessed more ""purposefully"" by the biological
entities co-evolving with the physical universe, due in part to the
globally-entangled nature of quantum interactions. Over time, this ability to
deliberately manipulate the chance factor in the fundamental level of quantum
interactions gradually evolves into the free will and self-awareness of higher
biological beings. The emergence of higher-level consciousness in turn greatly
enhances the entropy-production ability of the biological entities, making them
a powerful new form of the ""dissipative structures"" that nature constructs to
accelerate the entropy evolution of the universe. It is further shown that
complex, nonequilibrium systems (including the universe as a whole) have the
innate ability to spontaneously generate ever-renewable, highly-complex
structural features in response to a changing and evolving environment;
therefore natural selection is not the only driving mechanism for the
irreversible evolution of the internal characteristics of biological species.
