identified in an acid residue of the Krymka LL3.1 ordinary chondrite. Isotopic
measurements by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) verified a presolar
circumstellar origin for the grains. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
examination of the crystal structure and chemistry of the grains was enabled by
in situ sectioning and lift-out with a focused-ion-beam scanning-electron
microscope. Comparisons of isotopic compositions with models indicate that four
of the five grains formed in low-mass stars that evolved through the
red-giant/asymptotic-giant branches, whereas one grain formed in the ejecta of
a Type II supernova. Selected-area electron-diffraction patterns show that all
grains are single crystals of hibonite. Some grains contain stacking faults and
small spreads in orientation that can be attributed to a combination of growth
defects and mechanical processing by grain-grain collisions. The similar
structure of the supernova grain to those from RGB/AGB stars indicates a
similarity in the formation conditions. Radiation damage, if present, occurs
below our detection limit. Of the five grains we studied, only one has the pure
hibonite composition of CaAl12O19. All others contain minor amounts of Mg, Si,
Ti, and Fe. The microstructural data are generally consistent with theoretical
predictions, which constrain the circumstellar condensation temperature to a
range of 1480 K to 1743 K, assuming a corresponding total gas pressure between
1 x 10-3 and 1 x 10-6 atm. The TEM data were used to develop a calibration for
SIMS determination of Ti contents in oxide grains. Grains with extreme 18O
depletions, indicating deep mixing has occurred in their parent AGB stars, are
slightly Ti-enriched compared to grains from stars without deep mixing, most
likely reflecting differences in grain condensation conditions.

evolution of FUV radiation fields with a sample of 56 accreting and

emission decreases on timescales consistent with the decline of accretion in
classical T Tauri stars until reaching the chromospheric level in weak T Tauri
stars and debris disks. Overall, we find that the observed strength of high
energy radiation is consistent with that required by photoevaporation models to
dissipate the disks in timescales of approximately 10 Myr. Finally, we find
that the high energy fields that affect gas evolution are not similarly
affecting dust evolution; in particular, we find that disks with inner
clearings, the transitional disks, have similar levels of FUV emission as full

FUV-NUV colours with the integrated Mgb and Hbeta absorption linestrength
indices, strongest for FUV-NUV. Correlations with the NUV-V colour, Fe5015
index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. These correlations put
stringent constraints on the origin of the UV-upturn phenomenon in early-type
galaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. In particular,
despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between FUV-V colour
and Mg linestrength originally publicised by Burstein et al. (1988), which we
refer to as the ""Burstein relation"", suggesting a positive dependence of the
UV-upturn on metallicity. We argue that the scatter in the correlations is
real, and present mild evidence that a strong UV excess is preferentially
present in slow-rotating galaxies. We also demonstrate that most outliers in
the correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some at
very low levels. We believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,
afforded by the deep and varied data available for the SAURON sample, explains
why our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallower
surveys. This is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sample
of more distant early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

derive a precise formula for computing the exact Lipschitzian bound of the

this exact bound agrees with the coderivative norm of the aforementioned

sunspots. The nature of these formation processes is largely unknown. In this
contribution we elaborate on the formation of sunspots and particularly on the
formation of penumbrae. We report on observations that we obtained at the
German VTT on July 4, 2009 on the formation of the spot in AR 11024. This data
set is accomplished with data from SOHO/MDI which offers an entire time
coverage. Moreover, the evolution of AR 11024 is compared with a particular
event of penumbra formation in AR 11124 around November 13, 2010, using
intensity images from SDO/HMI. We conclude that two processes contribute to the
increase of the magnetic flux of a sunspot: (1) merging pores, and (2) emerging
bipoles of which the spot polarity migrates towards and merges with the spot.
As the penumbra forms the area, magnetic flux, and maximum field strength in
the umbra stay constant or increase slightly, i.e. the formation of the
penumbra is associated with flux emergence and an flux increase of the
proto-spot. If two pores merge or if a pore merges with a proto-spot a light
bridge is created. This initial light bridge dissolves in the further
evolution.

of a significant non-thermal component that is 32% of the total X-ray emission.
Point source emission makes up at most 14% of the non-thermal emission from the

modularity function, it is necessary to study its value on sparse graphs and

keeps the graphene single-crystalline during cutting, even thought the electron
beam induces considerable damage. Self-repair is mediated by mobile carbon
ad-atoms constantly repairing the defects caused by the electron beam. Our
technique allows reproducible fabrication and simultaneous imaging of
single-crystalline free-standing nanoribbons, nanotubes, nanopores, and single
carbon chains.

value of $n$, the non-dimensional equation of the static equilibrium has a
family of solutions, instead of the unique solution of the Lane-Emden equation

$\rho_0$ larger than the critical value $\rho_c$. There are no static solutions

reduced to the problem of the braking of a hypersonic flow with a velocity that
is 0.4-0.5 of the speed of light above the base of the spreading layer -- a
dense atmosphere made up of previously fallen matter. We show that turbulent
braking in the Prandtl-Karman model with universally accepted coefficients for
terrestrial conditions and laboratory experiments and a ladder of interacting
gravity waves in a stratified quasi-exponential atmosphere at standard
Richardson numbers lead to a spin-up of the massive zone that extends to the
ocean made up of a plasma with degenerate electrons. Turbulent braking in the
ocean at the boundary with the outer solid crust reduces the rotation velocity
to the solid-body rotation velocity of the star. This situation should lead to
strong heating of deep atmospheric layers and to the switch-off of the
explosive helium burning mechanism. Obviously, a more efficient mechanism for
the dissipation of a fast azimuthal flow in the atmosphere should operate in
X-ray bursters. We show that a giant solitary gravity wave in the atmosphere
can lead to energy dissipation and to a sharp decrease in azimuthal velocity in
fairly rarefied atmospheric layers above the zone of explosive helium burning
nuclear reactions. We discuss the reasons why this wave, that has no direct
analog in the Earth's atmosphere or ocean, appears and its stability. We pose
the question as to whether neutron stars with massive atmospheres, spun up to
high velocities by accreting matter from a disk, can exist among the observed
Galactic X-ray sources.

Though quasi-long range order is no longer possible and the usual
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition no longer exists, there are remnants of it. As
an application, we calculate the $I-V$ curves for Andreev reflexion when a
normal metal is placed in contact with the chain. Formally, there is always an
offset voltage $V_0$ below which no current can flow, however, in some regimes
$V_0$ can be negligible. Contrary to what happens without long-range

faster than any power law. Signatures of long range interactions and phase

the other hand, measurements of cosmic-ray secondary-to-primary ratios like the

our model, we assume that cosmic-rays after acceleration by supernova remnant
shock waves, escape downstream of the shock and remain confined within the
remnant until the shock slows down. During this time, the high-energy electrons
suffer from radiative energy losses and the cosmic-ray nuclei undergo nuclear
fragmentations due to their interactions with the matter. Once the cosmic-rays
are released from the supernova remnants, they follow diffusive propagation in
the Galaxy where they further suffer from radiative or fragmentation losses.

characterized; and (iii) to point out that with just a slightly modified
definition of semilocal simple connectivity which is sometimes also used in

condition ""semilocally simply connected"" plays a crucial role in classical
covering theory, in generalized covering theory one needs to consider the
condition ""homotopically Hausdorff"" instead. The paper also discusses which
implications hold between all of the abovementioned conditions and, via the
modified Spanier groups, it also unveils the weakest so far known algebraic
characterization for the existence of generalized covering spaces as introduced
by Fischer and Zastrow. For most of the implications, the paper also proves the

mining and sparse boolean matrix multiplication. It is well-known that large
speed gains can, for some computational problems, be obtained by using a
graphics processing unit (GPU) as a massively parallel computing device.
However, GPUs require highly regular control flow and memory access patterns,
and for this reason previous GPU methods for intersecting sets have used a
simple bitmap representation. This representation requires excessive space on
sparse data sets. In this paper we present a novel data layout, ""BatMap"", that
is particularly well suited for parallel processing, and is compact even for
sparse data.
  Frequent itemset mining is one of the most important applications of set
intersection. As a case-study on the potential of BatMaps we focus on frequent
pair mining, which is a core special case of frequent itemset mining. The main
finding is that our method is able to achieve speedups over both Apriori and
FP-growth when the number of distinct items is large, and the density of the
problem instance is above 1%. Previous implementations of frequent itemset
mining on GPU have not been able to show speedups over the best single-threaded
implementations.

related to the galactic environment. Cluster formation is governed by processes
acting on galactic scales, and star cluster disruption is driven by the tidal
field. In this paper, we present a self-consistent model for the formation and
evolution of star cluster populations, for which we combine an N-body/SPH
galaxy evolution code with semi-analytic models for star cluster evolution. The
model includes star formation, feedback, stellar evolution, and star cluster
disruption by two-body relaxation and tidal shocks. We apply the model by
simulating a suite of 9 isolated disc galaxies and 24 galaxy mergers. The
evolutionary histories of individual clusters in these simulations are
discussed to illustrate how the environment of clusters changes in time and
space. The resulting variability of the disruption rate with time and space
affects the properties of star cluster populations. The combined effect of
clusters escaping their dense formation sites (`cluster migration') and the
preferential disruption of clusters residing in dense environments (`natural
selection') implies that the mean disruption rate of the population decreases
with cluster age. This affects the slope of the cluster age distribution, which
becomes a function of the star formation rate density. The evolutionary
histories of clusters in a galaxy merger vary widely and determine which
clusters survive the merger. This impacts the age distributions and the
locations of the surviving clusters at all times during a merger. We conclude
that accounting for the interplay between the formation, disruption, and
orbital histories of clusters enables a more sophisticated interpretation of
observed properties of cluster populations, thereby extending the role of
cluster populations as tracers of galaxy evolution.

the tests by introducing inaccurate simplifying assumptions. We study the
impact of the sample geometry, non-linear processes, and biases induced by our
lack of understanding of the radial galaxy distribution on RSD measurements.
Using LasDamas simulations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II)
Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data, these effects are shown to be important at the
level of 20 per cent. Including them, we can accurately model the recovered
clustering in these mock catalogues on scales 30 -- 200 Mpc/h. Applying this
analysis to robustly measure parameters describing the growth history of the
Universe from the SDSS-II data, gives
$f(z=0.25)\sigma_8(z=0.25)=0.3512\pm0.0583$ and
$f(z=0.37)\sigma_8(z=0.37)=0.4602\pm0.0378$ when no prior is imposed on the
growth-rate, and the background geometry is assumed to follow a $\Lambda$CDM
model with the WMAP + SNIa priors. The standard WMAP constrained $\Lambda$CDM
model with General Relativity predicts
$f(z=0.25)\sigma_8(z=0.25)=0.4260\pm0.0141$ and
$f(z=0.37)\sigma_8(z=0.37)=0.4367\pm0.0136$, which is fully consistent with
these measurements.

the effect of large-scale nonlinear inhomogeneities. In the present paper we
discuss how observations constrain cosmological models featuring large voids.
We start by considering Copernican models, in which the observer is not
occupying a special position and homogeneity is preserved on a very large
scale. We show how these models, at least in their current realizations, are
constrained to give small, but perhaps not negligible in certain contexts,
corrections to the cosmological observables. We then examine non-Copernican
models, in which the observer is close to the center of a very large void.
These models can give large corrections to the observables which mimic an
accelerated FLRW model. We carefully discuss the main observables and tests
able to exclude them.

compact binary merger?"" is an intriguing one with crucial consequences to the
quest for gravitational waves (GW). Compact binary mergers are prime sources of
GW, targeted by current and next generation detectors. Numerical simulations
have demonstrated that these mergers eject energetic sub-relativistic (or even
relativistic) outflows. This is certainly the case if the mergers produce short
GRBs, but even if not, significant outflows are expected. The interaction of
such outflows with the surround matter inevitably leads to a long lasting radio
signal. We calculate the expected signal from these outflows (our calculations
are also applicable to short GRB orphan afterglows) and we discuss their
detectability. We show that the optimal search for such signal should,
conveniently, take place around 1.4 GHz. Realistic estimates of the outflow
parameters yield signals of a few hundred $\mu$Jy, lasting a few weeks, from
sources at the detection horizon of advanced GW detectors. Followup radio
observations, triggered by GW detection, could reveal the radio remnant even
under unfavorable conditions. Upcoming all sky surveys can detect a few dozen,
and possibly even thousands, merger remnants at any give time, thereby
providing robust merger rate estimates even before the advanced GW detectors
become operational. In fact, the radio transient RT 19870422 fits well the
overall properties predicted by our model and we suggest that its most probable
origin is a compact binary merger radio remnant.

Aquila X-1, 4U 1608-52, and many black holes to `C'-shaped for many atoll
sources. Furthermore, the regular pulsations, a diagonal transition between
soft and hard states, and the large scale hysteresis observed from IGR
J17480-2446 argue against some of the previous suggestions involving magnetic
field about atolls and millisecond pulsars. Our results also suggest that the
nature of spectral evolution throughout an outburst does not, at least
entirely, depend on the peak luminosity of the outburst. Besides, the source
took at least a month to trace the softer banana state, as opposed to a few
hours to a day, which is typical for an atoll source. In addition, while the
soft colour usually increases with intensity in the softer portion of an atoll
source, IGR J17480-2446 showed an opposite behaviour. From the detailed
spectral fitting we conclude that a blackbody+powerlaw model is the simplest
one, which describes the source continuum spectra well throughout the outburst.
We find that these two spectral components were plausibly connected with each
other, and they worked together to cause the source state evolution.

small-scale magnetic fields have been reported that appear to have enough
stored to heat the chromosphere. While significant progress has been made in
understanding small-scale phenomena, many specifics remain elusive. We present
here a detailed study of a single event of disappearance of a magnetic dipole
and associated chromospheric activity. Based on New Solar Telescope H$\alpha$
data and {\it Hinode} photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms and Ca II H
images we report the following. 1) Our analysis indicates that even very small
dipoles (elements separated by about 0\arcsec.5 or less) may reach the
chromosphere and trigger non-negligible chromospheric activity. 2) Careful
consideration of the magnetic environment where the new flux is deposited may
shed light on the details of magnetic flux removal from the solar surface. We
argue that the apparent collision and disappearance of two opposite polarity
elements may not necessarily indicate their cancellation (i.e., reconnection,
emergence of a ""U"" tube or submergence of $ \Omega $ loops). In our case, the
magnetic dipole disappeared by reconnecting with overlying large-scale inclined
plage fields. 3) Bright points seen in off-band H$\alpha$ images are very
well-correlated with the Ca II H bright points, which in turn are co-spatial
with G-band bright points. We further speculate that, in general, H$\alpha$
bright points are expected be co-spatial with photospheric BPs, however, a
direct comparison is needed to refine their relationship.

many the exact nature of the evolutionary channel(s) by which they form remains
uncertain. The canonical explanation calls for the progenitor binary system to
undergo two subsequent mass-transfer events, both of which are unstable and
lead to a common envelope (CE). However, it has been shown that if both CE
events obey the standard alpha-prescription (parametrizing energy loss), it is
not possible to reproduce all of the observed systems. The gamma-prescription
was proposed as an alternative to this description, instead parametrizing the
fraction of angular momentum carried away in dynamical-timescale mass loss. In
this paper, we analyze simultaneous energy and angular-momentum conservation,
and show that the gamma-prescription cannot adequately describe a CE event for
an arbitrary binary, nor can the first phase of mass loss always be understood
in general as a dynamical-timescale event. We consider in detail the first
episode of mass transfer in binary systems with initially low companion masses,
with a primary mass in the range 1.0--1.3 solar masses and an initial mass
ratio between the secondary and primary stars of 0.83--0.92. In these systems,
the first episode of dramatic mass loss may be stable, non-conservative mass
transfer. This strips the donor's envelope and dramatically raises the mass
ratio; the considered progenitor binary systems can then evolve into DWDs after
passing through a single CE during the second episode of mass loss. We find
that such a mechanism reproduces the properties of the observed DWD systems
which have an older component with less than approximately 0.46 solar masses
and mass ratios between the younger and older WDs greater than 1.

pulses. The scenario considered corresponds to a pump-probe scheme, in which
the first (pump) pulse excites the molecular ion to the first excited
dissociative state and the second (probe) pulse ionizes the electron as the ion
dissociates. The results of our numerical simulations for the ionization yield
as a function of the time delay between the two pulses exhibit characteristic
oscillations due to interferences between the partial electron waves emerging
from the two protons in the dissociating hydrogen molecular ion. We show that
the photon energy of the pump pulse should be in resonance with the $\sigma_g -
\sigma_u$ transition and the pump pulse duration should not exceed 5 fs in
order to generate a well confined nuclear wavepacket. The spreading of the
nuclear wavepacket during the dissociation is found to cause a decrease of the
amplitudes of the oscillations as the time delay increases. We develop an
analytical model to fit the oscillations and show how dynamic information about
the nuclear wavepacket, namely velocity, mean internuclear distance and
spreading, can be retrieved from the oscillations. The predictions of the
analytical model are tested well against the results of our numerical

scrutinize underlying dynamics in and/or beyond the standard model (BSM). As
one of the possible BSM physics which might be discovered early at the LHC,
extra neutral gauge bosons $Z^\prime$s are theoretical well motivated. Once
$Z^\prime$s are discovered at the LHC, it is crucial to discriminate different
$Z^\prime$s in various BSM. In principle such task can be accomplished by
measuring the angular distribution of the final states which are produced via
$Z^\prime$-mediated processes. In the real data analysis, asymmetry is always
adopted. In literature several asymmetries have been proposed at the LHC. Based
on these works, we stepped further on to study how to optimize the asymmetries
in the left-right model and the sequential standard model, as the examples of
BSM. In this paper, we examined four kinds of asymmetries, namely
rapidity-dependent forward-backward asymmetry, one-side forward-backward
asymmetry, central charge asymmetry and edge charge asymmetry (see text for
details), with $\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e,\mu$), $b\bar b$ and $t\bar t$ as the
final states. In the calculations with $b\bar b$ and $t\bar t$ final states,
the QCD-induced higher order contributions to the asymmetric cross section were
also included. For each kind of final states, we estimated the four kinds of
asymmetries and especially the optimal cut usually associated with the
definition of the asymmetry. Our numerical results indicated that the capacity
to discriminate $Z^\prime$ models can be improved by imposing the optimal cuts.

being called big bang. Recent developments in loop quantum cosmology avoid the
singularity and the big bang is replaced by a big bounce. A classical theory of
gravitation in flat space-time also avoids the singularity under natural
conditions on the density parameters. The universe contracts to a positive
minimum and then it expands during all times. It is not symmetric with regard
to its minimum implying a finite age measured with proper time of the universe.
The space of the universe is flat and the total energy is conserved. Under the
assumption that the sum of the density parameters is a little bit bigger than
one the universe is very hot in early times. Later on, the cosmological model
agrees with the one of general relativity. A new interpretation of a

the 14th International Conference on Representations of Algebras (ICRA XIV),
held in August 2010 in Tokyo. We first provide an introduction to quantum loop
algebras and their finite-dimensional representations. We explain in particular
Nakajima's geometric description of the irreducible q-characters in terms of
graded quiver varieties. We then present a recent attempt to understand the
tensor structure of the category of finite- dimensional representations by
means of cluster algebras.

type II cosmological models representing massive string. The energy-momentum
tensor for such string as formulated by Letelier (1983) is used to construct
massive string cosmological models for which we assume that the expansion
($\theta$) in the models is proportional to the shear ($\sigma$). This
condition leads to $A = B^{m}$, where A and B are the metric coefficients and m
is constant. We have derived two types of models depending on different values
of m i.e. for $m\neq \sqrt{2}$ and $m = \sqrt{2}$ respectively. For suitable
choice of constant m (i.e. for $m = 1/2$), it is observed that in early stage
of the evolution of the universe, the universe is dominated by strings in both
cases. Our models are in accelerating phase which is consistent to the recent
observations of type Is supernovae. Some physical and geometric behaviour of
the models are also discussed.

subgroup, $\pi_1^{sg}(X,x)$, of the quasitopological fundamental group of a
based space $(X,x)$, $\pt$, its topological properties as a subgroup of the
topological fundamental group $\pi_1^{\tau}(X,x)$ and its influence on the
existence of universal covering of $X$. First, we introduce small generated
spaces which have indiscrete topological fundamental groups and also small
generated coverings which are universal coverings in the categorical sense.
Second, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the
small generated coverings.
  Finally, by introducing the notion of semi-locally small generatedness we
show that the quasitopological fundamental groups of semi-locally small
generated spaces are topological groups.
