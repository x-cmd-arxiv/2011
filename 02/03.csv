but the encoded proteome is not being explored to its fullest. Our bibliometric
analysis of several large protein families, including those known to be
""druggable"", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were
known prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical
research system severely limits the exploration of the proteins in the 'dark
matter' of the proteome, despite unbiased genetic approaches that have pointed
to their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few
genome-derived targets have led to approved drugs.

prior distribution for the regression coefficients is the g-prior of Zellner
(1986). However, there are two standard cases in which the associated
covariance matrix does not exist, and the conventional prior of Zellner can not
be used: if the number of observations is lower than the number of variables
(large p and small n paradigm), or if some variables are linear combinations of
others. In such situations a prior distribution derived from the prior of
Zellner can be used, by introducing a ridge parameter. This prior introduced by
Gupta and Ibrahim (2007) is a flexible and simple adaptation of the g-prior. In
this paper we study the influence of the ridge parameter on the selection of
variables. A simple way to choose the associated hyper-parameters is proposed.
The method is valid for any generalized linear mixed model and we focus on the
case of probit mixed models when some variables are linear combinations of
others. The method is applied to both simulated and real datasets obtained from
Affymetrix microarray experiments. Results are compared to those obtained with
the Bayesian Lasso.

permittivity in each layer only varies orthogonal to the polarization. Based on
obtained reflectance data covering a suitable frequency interval,
time-localized pulse data are synthesized and applied to reconstruct the
refractive index profile in the leftmost layer by identifying the local,
time-domain Fresnel reflection at each point. Once the first layer is known,
its impact on the reflectance data is stripped off, and the procedure repeated

the line in stellar spectra is 1318.94 (+,- 0.01) A. Observations of giant
stars provide further evidence that this line is not due to N I. It is proposed
that this line is a decay from a previously unknown level in S I, which lies
above the first ionization limit. This is identified with the 3d singlet D (odd

1309.3 A then needs to be revised. The 1309.3 A line has been identified here
for the first time in an astrophysical source. The singlet D (odd parity) level
could, in principle, be populated by collisions from nearby autoionizing levels
that have large number-densities, through population by di-electronic capture.
Spin-orbit interaction with the autoionizing triplet D (odd parity) term might
also lead to di-electronic capture into the singlet D (odd parity) level. A

largest benefit in combating losses due to fading. However, symbol level
cooperation poses significant implementation challenges, especially in
synchronizing the behaviors and carrier frequencies of distributed nodes. We
present the implementation and characterization of a complete, real-time

physical layer cooperation without a central synchronization source, and are

density of electromagnetic waves in linear media in electromagnetic and
material parts. In this division, the electromagnetic part of these quantities
have the same form as in vacuum when written in terms of the macroscopic
electric and magnetic fields, the material momentum is calculated directly from
the Lorentz force that acts on the charges of the medium, the material energy
is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the charges of the medium
and the material energy flux results from the interaction of the electric field
with the magnetized medium. We present reasonable models for linear dispersive
non-absorptive dielectric and magnetic media that agree with this division. We
also argue that the electromagnetic momentum of our division can be associated
with the electromagnetic relativistic momentum, inspired on the recent work of
Barnett [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 070401 (2010)] that showed that the Abraham
momentum is associated with the kinetic momentum and the Minkowski momentum is
associated with the canonical momentum.

the emission spectrum from the Galactic Center Region. Hooper and Goodenough
suggest that the claimed excess can be well explained by 7-10 GeV annihilating
dark matter with a power law density profile if the dark matter annihilates
predominantly to tau pairs. In this paper we present such a dark matter model
by extending the MSSM to include four Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet. A
Z2 symmetry is imposed that enforces a Yukawa structure so that the up quarks,
down quarks, and leptons each receive mass from a distinct doublet. This leads
to an enhanced coupling of scalars to leptons and allows the model to naturally
achieve the required phenomenology in order to explain the gamma ray excess.
Our model yields the correct dark matter thermal relic density and avoids
collider bounds from measurements of the Z width as well as direct production
at LEP.

In a recent

source that is likely relevant to all accretion disk systems. Lift is generated
by slightly different supersonic gas stream speeds flowing over and under the
disk at the bright spot. In this conference proceeding, we focus on whether a
brown dwarf donor star accreting onto a white dwarf primary has enough mass to
contribute to disk tilt. We also would like to obtain whether a white dwarf -
brown dwarf close binary system has enough mass to induce and maintain a disk
tilt of four degrees. We adopt SDSS 103533.03+055158.4 as our model system
which has a mass transfer rate of (10 \pm 2) x 10-12 M* yr-1. We find that the
brown dwarf in SDSS 1035 does not have enough mass to contribute to disk tilt.
We find a gross magnitude of the minimum mass transfer rate to be - 10-10 M*
yr-1 . We conclude that SDSS 1035 does not seem to have a high enough mass
transfer rate to induce and maintain an observable disk tilt. Hence one reason
why brown dwarf donor systems may be so difficult to find could be due to their
low mass transfer rates which do not induce observable dynamical effects that
is typical in white dwarf-red dwarf CVs.

paradigmatic model to study quantum chaos and specially the dynamical
transition from integrability to chaos. By means of exact diagonalizations we
analyze the relevance of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as
the influence of other factors, like the energy and structure of the initial
state, or the dimension of the Hilbert space. We also obtain analytical
expressions linking the degree of thermalization for a given observable with
the so-called number of principal components for transition strengths
originated at a given energy, with the dimensions of the whole Hilbert space
and microcanonical energy shell, and with the correlations generated by the
observable. As the strength of the residual interaction is increased an
order-to-chaos transition takes place, and we show that the onset of Wigner
spectral fluctuations, which is the standard signature of chaos, is not
sufficient to guarantee thermalization in finite systems. When all the
signatures of chaos are fulfilled, including the quasi complete delocalization
of eigenfunctions, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is the mechanism
responsible for the thermalization of certain types of observables, such as
(linear combinations of) occupancies and strength function operators. Our
results also suggest that fully chaotic systems will thermalize relative to

electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime. In each
of the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing
radiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In
the near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force
that prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background
spacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because
of its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But
it is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no
force on the particle. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is
fully responsible for the self-force. The mathematical tools required to derive
the equations of motion of a point scalar charge, a point electric charge, and
a point mass in a specified background spacetime are developed here from
scratch. The review begins with a discussion of the basic theory of bitensors.
It then applies the theory to the construction of convenient coordinate systems
to chart a neighbourhood of the particle's word line. It continues with a
thorough discussion of Green's functions in curved spacetime. The review
presents a detailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion.
Because the notion of a point mass is problematic in general relativity, the
review concludes with an alternative derivation of the equations of motion that
applies to a small body of arbitrary internal structure.

volume of the manifold of interest. The present paper explores the ways to
optimise the above routine by varying the shapes of the manifolds enclosing the
energy-constrained manifold. The resulting improvement in the sampling
efficiency is about a factor of five for a 14-dimensional Hilbert space. The
advantage of the above algorithm is that it does not compromise on the rigorous
statistical nature of the sampling outcome and hence can be used to test other
more sophisticated Monte-Carlo routines. The present attempts to optimise the
enclosing manifolds also bring insights into the geometrical properties of the
energy constrained manifold itself.

systems in the Galactic field. For the present study we select a homogeneous
sample covering about 675 square degrees in the direction of the NGP. It
contains nearly 670,000 MS stars with apparent magnitudes between 15 and 20.5
mag and spectral classes later than G5. The data were taken from the SDSS. We
construct the two-point correlation function (2PCF) for angular separations
between 2 and 30 arcsecs. The resulting clustering signal is modeled by means
of the Wasserman-Weinberg technique. We show that the distribution of
semi-major axis is consistent with the canonical Oepik law and infer that about
10% of all stars in the solar neighbourhood belong to a WB system. To reduce
the noise from optical pairs and to increase the sensitivity of the analysis at
larger separations, we include distance information from photometric
parallaxes. Introducing a novel weighting procedure based on the binding
probability of a double star, we infer the distribution of colours and mass
ratios, which were carefully corrected for observational selection effects.
About 4,000 WBs were taken into account statistically, whose components have
masses between 0.2 and 0.85 solar masses. We find that the WB colour
distribution is in accord with the colour distribution of single field stars.
However, pairs with a mass difference exceeding 0.5 solar masses seem to be
systematically underrepresented as compared to a random pairing of field stars.
Our results are broadly in agreement with prior studies but a direct comparison
is difficult and often impossible. The novel procedure presented in this thesis
can be regarded as complementary to common proper motion studies, and
constitutes a viable approach to study the statistical properties of WBs in the
Galactic field.

By comparing the spectrum and the equivalent widths of several atomic and
molecular features with those for stars in the IRTF near-infrared library, we
revise the spectral type to M2.5V, which is later than usually adopted (K7V).
This implies a substantially cooler stellar temperature than previously
assumed. Comparison with various pre-main sequence models suggests that TW Hya
is only ~3 Myr old; much younger than the usually adopted 8 - 10 Myr. Analysis
of the relative strengths of the H lines seen in the spectrum yields estimates
for the temperature and density of the emitting region of T_e > 7500 K and n_e
~ 10^{12} - 10^{13} cm^{-3}. The thickness of the emitting region is 10^2 -
10^4 km and the covering fraction is f_\ast ~ 0.04. Our derived physical
parameter values agree with the predictions of the magnetospheric accretion
scenario. The highest signal-to-noise H lines have profiles that indicate
multiple emission components. We derive an excess spectrum (above that of the
M2.5V template) that peaks in the H band. Although our derived veiling values,
~ 0.1, agree with previous estimates, the excess spectrum does not match that
of current models in which this flux is generated by an inner optically thin
disk. We suggest that the excess flux spectrum instead reflects the differences
in atmospheric opacity, gravity, and age between TW Hya and older, higher
gravity field M2.5 dwarfs.

information retrieval using a large array of N nano-mechanical probes, N ~

positioning of the array, thus all signals retrieved by the probes of the array
at a given sampling moment are affected by the same amount of random position
jitter. Therefore a massively parallel probe storage device is an example of a
noisy communication channel with long range correlations between channel
outputs due to the global positioning errors. We find that these correlations
have a profound effect on the channel's properties. For example, it turns out
that the channel's information capacity does approach 1 bit per probe in the
limit of high signal-to-noise ratio, but the rate of the approach is only
polynomial in the channel noise strength. Moreover, any error correction code
with block size N >> 1 such that codewords correspond to the instantaneous
outputs of the all probes in the array exhibits an error floor independently of
the code rate. We illustrate this phenomenon explicitly using Reed-Solomon
codes the performance of which is easy to simulate numerically. We also discuss
capacity-achieving error correction codes for the global jitter channel and
their complexity.

signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars.

into five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (radius < 1.25

662 Neptune-size (2 Earth radii < radius < 6 Earth radii), 165 Jupiter-size (6

appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging
from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Five are less than twice the
size of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than
Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates

neither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are
small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in
resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly

stable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius
relationship. Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of
these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed
multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systems
that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of

population of systems with multiple super-Earth-size and Neptune-size planets

on models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation of

1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit
timing variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary
systems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit
timing analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of
planet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive
of TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span
of observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet
masses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple
transiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We
find that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does
not vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per
star, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a
single transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We
anticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with
multiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a
powerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital
dynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least
six years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the
dynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive
to planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type
stars.

a wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planet
formation. The discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by NASA's Kepler
mission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution of
small exoplanets. Measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is only
practical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques
(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).
Yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to study
the distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transit
durations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). We
analyze the transit duration distribution of Kepler planet candidates. We find
that for host stars with T_eff > 5100 K we cannot invert this to infer the
eccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possible
systematics in the host star densities. With this limitation in mind, we
compare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule out
extreme distributions. If we assume a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution for
Kepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of
0.1-0.25 for host stars with T_eff < 5100 K. We compare the transit duration
distribution for different subsets of Kepler planet candidates and discuss
tentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. High-precision
spectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will be
required to confirm which trends are real and which are the results of
systematic errors in stellar radii. Finally, we identify planet candidates that
must be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

scattering problem. The Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the problem is
reformulated in the form of a set of inhomogeneous equations with a
finite-range driving term. The boundary conditions at infinity for this set of
equations have been proven to be purely outgoing waves. The formulation
{presented here} is based on splitting the interaction potential into a finite
range core part and a long range tail part. The conventional matching procedure
coupled with the integral Lippmann-Schwinger equations technique are used in
the formal theoretical basis of this approach. The reformulated scattering
problem is suitable for application in the exterior complex scaling technique:
the practical advantage is that after the complex scaling the problem is
reduced to a boundary problem with zero boundary conditions. The Coulomb wave
functions are used only at a single point: if this point is chosen to be at a
sufficiently large distance, on using the asymptotic expansion of Coulomb
functions, one may completely avoid the Coulomb functions in the calculations.
The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical calculations for two
models.

primordial gravitational waves through their imprint on the polarization of the
CMB if the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, is greater than 0.03. To achieve this
goal, instrumental systematic errors must be controlled with unprecedented
accuracy. Here, we build on previous work to use simulations of Spider
observations to examine the impact of several systematic effects that have been
characterized through testing and modeling of various instrument components. In
particular, we investigate the impact of the non-ideal spectral response of the
half-wave plates, coupling between focal plane components and the Earth's

diffuse polarized foreground emission based on a three-dimensional model of the
Galactic magnetic field and dust, and study the interaction of this foreground
emission with our observation strategy and instrumental effects. We find that
the expected level of foreground and systematic contamination is sufficiently

challenging because fixed-order perturbation theory breaks down near the peak
region, and because multiple scales complicate the resummation. To avoid using
a jet veto, one can consider inclusive observables, in which every particle is
in a jet. We demonstrate that calculating the mass of the hardest jet in
multijet events can be problematic, and we give an example of an inclusive
observable, asymmetric thrust, which can be resummed to next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. Exclusive observables with out-of-jet regions are more
complicated. Even for e+e- dijet events at energy Q, to calculate the mass m of
jets of size R, one must impose a veto on the energy omega of extra jets to
force dijet kinematics; then there are both log m/Q and log m/omega
singularities. To proceed, we suggest a refactorization of the soft function in
the small R limit. To justify this refactorization, we show that the expansion
of the resummed distribution is in excellent agreement with fixed order. This
motivates considering the expansion around small R as a useful handle on
producing phenomenologically useful resummed jet mass distributions. The strong
evidence we give for refactorization at small R is independent of non-global
logarithms, which are not the subject of this paper.

formally solve the coupled Schrodinger equations for the zero modes of these

We show how these zero modes can be used to construct a solution matrix, whose

mass modes exist. These facts are crucial in determining stability of the
corresponding background configuration. We provide examples of the general
analysis for domain-wall models of an infinite extra dimension and domain-wall

dependence and intrinsic task difficulty of human contour detection? To answer
this question, we created a synthetic image set that prevents sole reliance on
either low-level visual features or high-level context for the detection of
target objects. Rendered images consist of smoothly varying, globally aligned
contour fragments (amoebas) distributed among groups of randomly rotated
fragments (clutter). The time course and accuracy of amoeba detection by humans
was measured using a two-alternative forced choice protocol with self-reported
confidence and variable image presentation time (20-200 ms), followed by an
image mask optimized so as to interrupt visual processing. Measured
psychometric functions were well fit by sigmoidal functions with exponential
time constants of 30-91 ms, depending on amoeba complexity. Key aspects of the
psychophysical experiments were accounted for by a computational network model,
in which simulated responses across retinotopic arrays of orientation-selective
elements were modulated by cortical association fields, represented as
multiplicative kernels computed from the differences in pairwise edge
statistics between target and distractor images. Comparing the experimental and
the computational results suggests that each iteration of the lateral
interactions takes at least 37.5 ms of cortical processing time. Our results
provide evidence that cortical association fields between orientation selective
elements in early visual areas can account for important temporal and
task-dependent aspects of the psychometric curves characterizing human contour
perception, with the remaining discrepancies postulated to arise from the
influence of higher cortical areas.

parameters. We combine models for magnetic flux generation, buoyancy
instability, and transport, which encompass the entire convection zone. The
model components are: (1) a thin-layer alpha-Omega dynamo at the base of the
convection zone; (2) buoyancy instabilities and the rise of flux tubes through
the convection zone in 3D, which provides a physically consistent determination
of emergence latitudes and tilt angles; and (3) horizontal flux transport at
the surface. For solar-type stars and rotation periods longer than about 10
days, the latitudinal dynamo waves generated by the deep-seated alpha-Omega
dynamo are faithfully reflected by the surface distribution of magnetic flux.
For rotation periods of the order of two days, however, Coriolis acceleration
of rising flux loops leads to surface flux emergence at much higher latitudes
than the dynamo waves at the bottom of the convection zone reach. A similar
result is found for a K0V star with a rotation period of two days. In the case
of a rapidly rotating K1 subgiant, overlapping dynamo waves lead to noisy
activity cycles and mixed-polarity fields at high latitudes.

(2009, MNRAS, 397, 1661) suggested the net stellar dust production of the
quasar host galaxy SDSS J1148+5251 may be sufficient to explain the large dust
mass detected in this galaxy, albeit under some very special assumptions (e.g.,
'closed box' evolution and a rather high gas mass). Here it is shown that since
accretion of essentially pristine material may lower the efficiency of dust
formation significantly, and the observationally derived dust-to-gas ratios for
these high-redshift galaxies are remarkably high, stellar dust production is
likely insufficient. A model including metallicity-dependent, non-stellar dust
formation ('secondary dust') is presented. The required contribution from this
non-stellar dust component appears too large, however. If all observational
constraints are to be met, the resultant dust-to-metals ratio is close to
unity, which means that almost all interstellar metals exist in the form dust.
This is a very unlikely situation and suggests the large dust-to-gas ratios at
high-redshifts may be due to observational uncertainties and/or or incorrect
calibration of conversion factors for gas and dust tracers.

J.J. Erpenbeck in [Er1]. Working with the Zeldovitch-von Neumann-D\""oring (ZND)
model, which assumes a finite reaction rate but ignores effects like viscosity
corresponding to second order derivatives, he used a normal mode analysis to
define a stability function $V(\tau,\eps)$ whose zeros in $\Re \tau>0$
correspond to multidimensional perturbations of a steady detonation profile
that grow exponentially in time. Later in a remarkable paper [Er3] he provided
strong evidence, by a combination of formal and rigorous arguments, that for
certain classes of steady ZND profiles, unstable zeros of $V$ exist for
perturbations of sufficiently large transverse wavenumber $\eps$, even when the
von Neumann shock, regarded as a gas dynamical shock, is uniformly stable in
the sense defined (nearly twenty years later) by Majda. In spite of a great
deal of later numerical work devoted to computing the zeros of $V(\tau,\eps)$,
the paper \cite{Er3} remains the only work we know of that presents a detailed
and convincing theoretical argument for detecting them.
  The analysis in [Er3] points the way toward, but does not constitute, a
mathematical proof that such unstable zeros exist. In this paper we identify
the mathematical issues left unresolved in [Er3] and provide proofs, together
with certain simplifications and extensions, of the main conclusions about
stability and instability of detonations contained in that paper.

We find a majority of methanol maser morphologies to be complex with some
sources previously determined to have regular morphologies in fact being
embedded within larger structures. This suggests that some maser spots do not
have a compact core, which leads them being resolved in high angular resolution
observations. This also casts doubt on interpretations of the origin of
methanol maser emission solely based on source morphologies. We also
investigate the association of methanol masers with mid-infrared emission and
find very close correspondence between methanol masers and 24 micron point

that Class II methanol masers are unambiguous tracers of embedded high-mass

and transport properties of fermion systems with charge frustration. We
consider an extended Falicov-Kimball model in which itinerant spinless fermions
interact repulsively by U with localized particles whose distribution satisfies
a local constraint under geometrical frustration, the so-called ice rule. We
numerically calculate the density of states, optical conductivity, and inverse
participation ratio for the models on the pyrochlore, checkerboard, and kagome
lattices, and discuss the nature of metal-insulator transitions at commensurate
fillings. As a result, we show that the ice-rule local constraint leads to
several universal features in the electronic structure; a charge gap opens at a
considerably small U compared to the bandwidth, and the energy spectrum
approaches a characteristic form in the large U limit, that is, the
noninteracting tight-binding form in one dimension or the $\delta$-functional
peak. In the large U region, the itinerant fermions are confined in the
macroscopically-degenerate ice-rule configurations, which consist of a bunch of
one-dimensional loops: We call this insulating state the charge ice. On the
other hand, transport properties are much affected by the geometry and
dimensionality of lattices; e.g., the pyrochlore lattice model exhibits a
transition from a metallic to the charge-ice insulating state by increasing U,
while the checkerboard lattice model appears to show Anderson localization
before opening a gap. Meanwhile, in the kagome lattice case, we do not obtain
clear evidence of Anderson localization. Our results elucidate the universality
and diversity of phase transitions to the charge-ice insulator in fully

from the perspective that their basic distribution and associated generating
functions obey the statistical-mechanical structure of systems with interacting
degrees of freedom. Based on this fact we look briefly into the less known case
of processes that display phase transitions along time. When the density
distribution \psi_{n}(t) for the occurrence of the n-th event at time t is
considered to be a partition function, of a 'microcanonical' type for n
'degrees of freedom' at fixed 'energy' t, one obtains a set of four partition
functions of which that for the generating function variable z and Laplace
transform variable \epsilon, conjugate to n and t, respectively, plays a
central role. These partition functions relate to each other in the customary
way and in accordance to the precepts of large deviations theory, while the
entropy, or Massieu potential, derived from \psi_{n}(t) satisfies an Euler
relation. We illustrate this scheme first for an ordinary renewal process of
events generated by a simple exponential waiting time distribution \psi (t).
Then we examine a process modelled after the so-called Hamiltonian Mean Field
(HMF) model that is representative of agents that perform a repeated task with
an associated outcome, such as an opinion poll. When a sequence of (many)
events takes place in a sufficiently short time the process exhibits clustering
of the outcome, but for larger times the process resembles that of independent
events. The two regimes are separated by a sharp transition, technically of the
second order. Finally we point out the existence of a similar scheme for random
walk processes.

information within a scale comparable to the cell size where interactions
between cell membrane and other organelle structures occur, micron size spatial
resolution is required. Due to the large wavelength, however, the joint
capability of THz near-field imaging with real-time acquisition, which is a
highly desirable ability for observing real-time changes of in vivo sample,

prevent the field from growing unbounded at any location. We consider the space
of speed controllers that can be parametrized by a finite set of basis

to compute a speed controller in this space to keep the field bounded, if such

presents a basic conundrum: modules ought to be sufficiently independent to
guarantee functional specialization and sufficiently connected to bind multiple
processors for efficient information transfer. It is commonly accepted that
small-world architecture of short lengths and large local clustering may solve
this problem. However, there is intrinsic tension between shortcuts generating
small-worlds and the persistence of modularity; a global property unrelated to
local clustering. Here, we present a possible solution to this puzzle. We first
show that a modified percolation theory can define a set of hierarchically
organized modules made of strong links in functional brain networks. These
modules are ""large-world"" self-similar structures and, therefore, are far from
being small-world. However, incorporating weaker ties to the network converts
it into a small-world preserving an underlying backbone of well-defined
modules. Remarkably, weak ties are precisely organized as predicted by theory
maximizing information transfer with minimal wiring cost. This trade-off
architecture is reminiscent of the ""strength of weak ties"" crucial concept of
social networks. Such a design suggests a natural solution to the paradox of
efficient information flow in the highly modular structure of the brain.

reached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rocky
planet, Kepler-10b. Two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152

T[BJD]=2454964.57375+N*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting
6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris T[BJD]=2454971.6761+N*45.29485 days.
Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the
viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up
observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that
the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star
is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at
1-minute cadence for >4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation
frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the
fundamental stellar properties. Kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5
Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like Main Sequence star with Teff=5627 +/- 44 K,
Mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 Msun, and Rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 Rsun. Physical models
simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler

fermions is found under the conditions that the ordinary four-dimensional
massless gluon is not condensed and that color-triplet scalar bound states are
not formed. For bulk fermions with zero modes for the left- and right-handed
components, the mass parameters are required to be at least $c\simg 1/2$ and

from weak-doublet scalar bound states which trigger electroweak symmetry

significantly more complex than those for small molecules. Small molecules
cross the permeabilized membrane by diffusion whereas plasmid DNA first
interacts with the electropermeabilized part of the cell surface, forming
localized aggregates. The dynamics of this process is still poorly understood
because direct observations have been limited to scales of the order of
seconds. Here, cells are electropermeabilized in the presence of plasmid DNA
and monitored with a temporal resolution of 2 ms. This allows us to show that
during the first pulse application, plasmid complexes, or aggregates, start to
form at distinct sites on the cell membrane. FRAP measurements show that the
positions of these sites are remarkably immobile during the application of
further pluses. A theoretical model is proposed to explain the appearance of
distinct interaction sites, the quantitative increase in DNA and also their

resulted that such a magnetic component becomes particularly important in the
high frequency portion of the frequency range of ground based interferometers
for GWs which arises from standard General Theory of Relativity (GTR).
Recently, such a magnetic component has been extended to GWs arising from
Scalar-Tensor Gravity (STG) too. After a review of some important issues on GWs
in STG, in this paper we re-analyse the magnetic component in the framework of
STG from a different point of view, by correcting an error in a previous paper
and by releasing a more precise response function. In this way, we also show
that if one neglects the magnetic contribution considering only the
low-frequency approximation of the electric contribution, an important part of
the signal could be, in principle, lost. The determination of a more precise
response function for the magnetic contribution is important also in the
framework of the possibility to distinguish other gravitational theories from
GTR. At the end of the paper an expansion of the main results is also shown in
order to recall the presence of the magnetic component in GRT too.

analysis fail to capture their dynamics. Typical systems exhibit different
scales of dynamics, ranging from the fine-grain dynamics of interactions (which
recently led researchers to consider temporal versions of distance,
connectivity, and related indicators), to the evolution of network properties
over longer periods of time. This paper proposes a general approach to study
that evolution for both atemporal and temporal indicators, based respectively
on sequences of static graphs and sequences of time-varying graphs that cover
successive time-windows. All the concepts and indicators, some of which are
new, are expressed using a time-varying graph formalism.

$f(x,y)$ on the unit disc $D=\{(x,y):x^2+y^2\leq1\}$ is proposed, given that
noisy data of $f(x,y)$ are observed on a discrete grid of edge width $\Delta$.
Our estimation procedure is based on minimizing over $\beta\in[0,\pi)$ the
$L_2$ distance between empirical versions of $f$ and $\tau_{\beta}f$, the image
of $f$ after reflection at the axis along $(\cos\beta,\sin\beta)$. Here, $f$
and $\tau_{\beta}f$ are estimated using truncated radial series of the Zernike
type. The inherent symmetry properties of the Zernike functions result in a
particularly simple estimation procedure for $\beta$. It is shown that the
estimate $\hat{\beta}$ converges at the parametric rate $\Delta^{-1}$ for
images $f$ of bounded variation. Further, we establish asymptotic normality of
$\hat{\beta}$ if $f$ is Lipschitz continuous. The method is applied to
calibrating the point spread function (PSF) for the deconvolution of images
from confocal microscopy. For various reasons the PSF characterizing the
problem may not be rotationally invariant but rather only reflection symmetric
with respect to two orthogonal axes. For an image of a bead acquired by a
confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS), these axes are estimated and
corresponding confidence intervals are constructed. They turn out to be close
to the coordinate axes of the imaging device. As cause for deviation from
rotational invariance, this indicates some slight misalignment of the optical
system or anisotropy of the immersion medium rather than some irregular shape
of the bead. In an extensive simulation study, we show that using a symmetrized
version of the observed PSF significantly improves the subsequent
reconstruction process of the target image.

matter-density bispectrum (and power spectrum) from very large to small scales
and that are at the same time consistent with perturbation theory at low $k$
and with halo models at high $k$. We use a Lagrangian framework to decompose
the bispectrum into ""3-halo"", ""2-halo"", and ""1-halo"" contributions, related to
""perturbative"" and ""non-perturbative"" terms. We describe a simple
implementation of this approach and present a detailed comparison with
numerical simulations. We show that the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions contain
counterterms that ensure their decay at low $k$, as required by physical
constraints, and allow a better match to simulations. Contrary to the power
spectrum, the standard 1-loop perturbation theory can be used for the
perturbative 3-halo contribution because it does not grow too fast at high $k$.
Moreover, it is much simpler and more accurate than two resummation schemes
investigated in this paper. We obtain a good agreement with numerical
simulations on both large and small scales, but the transition scales are
poorly described by the simplest implementation. This cannot be amended by
simple modifications to the halo parameters, but we show how it can be
corrected for the power spectrum and the bispectrum through a simple
interpolation scheme that is restricted to this intermediate regime. Then, we
reach an accuracy on the order of 10% on mildly and highly nonlinear scales,
while an accuracy on the order of 1% is obtained on larger weakly nonlinear
scales. This also holds for the real-space two-point correlation function.

Gamma Ray Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs). We show a model
based on canonical physics and astrophysics for SGRs and AXPs powered by
massive highly magnetized rotating white dwarfs (WDs), in total analogy with
pulsars powered by rotating neutron stars (NSs). We predict for SGR 0418+5729 a
lower limit for its spin-down rate, $\dot{P} \geq L_X P^3/(4\pi^2 I)=1.18\times
10^{-16}$ where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the WD. We show for SGRs and
AXPs that, the occurrence of the glitch and the gain of rotational energy, is
due to the release of gravitational energy associated to the contraction and
decrease of the moment of inertia of the WDs. The steady emission and the
outburst following the glitch are explained by the loss of rotational energy of
the Wds, in view of the much larger moment of inertia of the WDs, as compared
to the one of NSs and/or quark stars. There is no need here to invoke the
unorthodox concept of magnetic energy release due to decay of overcritical
magnetic fields, as assumed in the magnetar model. A new astrophysical scenario
for the SGRs and AXPs associated to Supernova remnants is presented. The
observational campaigns of the X-ray Japanese satellite Suzaku on AE Aquarii
and the corresponding theoretical works by Japanese groups and recent results
of the Hubble Space Telescope, give crucial information for our theoretical
model. Follow-on missions of Hubble Telescope and VLT are highly recommended to
give further observational evidence of this most fundamental issue of
relativistic astrophysics: the identification of the true SGRs/AXPs energy
source.

brighter than its quiescence level and the ellipsoidal modulation diluted by
strong flaring activity. Spectroscopic data obtained with the 10.4-m GTC in
2010 reveals radial velocity variations of ~500 km/s over 3 h. A simultaneous
fit to the photometry and spectroscopy using sinusoids to represent the

explicit Euler scheme fails to converge strongly to the exact solution.
Recently, an explicit strongly convergent numerical scheme, called the tamed
Euler method, is proposed in [Hutzenthaler, Jentzen & Kloeden, Ann. Appl.
Probab., 22 (2012), pp. 1611-1641.] for such SDEs. Motivated by their work, we
here introduce a tamed version of the Milstein scheme for SDEs with commutative
noise. The proposed method is also explicit and easily implementable, but
achieves higher strong convergence order than the tamed Euler method does. In
recovering the strong convergence order one of the new method, new difficulties
arise and kind of a bootstrap argument is developed to overcome them. Finally,
an illustrative example confirms the computational efficiency of the tamed
Milstein method compared to the tamed Euler method.

discrete-time model of the CM system was established some time ago arising as a
pole-reduction of a semi-discrete version of the KP equation, and was shown to
lead to an exactly integrable correspondence (multivalued map). In this paper
we present the full KP solution based on the commutativity of the discrete-time
flows in the two discrete KP variables. The compatibility of the corresponding
Lax matrices is shown to lead directly to the relevant closure relation on the
level of the Lagrangians. Performing successive continuum limits on both the
level of the KP equation as well as of the CM system, we establish the proper
Lagrange 1-form structure for the continuum case of the CM model. We use the
example of the three-particle case to elucidate the implementation of the novel
least-action principle, which was presented in [19], for the simpler case of
Lagrange 1-forms.

chemistry of CO in three-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent
molecular clouds. We compare the different models both by looking at the
behaviour of integrated quantities such as the mean CO fraction or the
cloud-averaged CO-to-H2 conversion factor, and also by studying the detailed
distribution of CO as a function of gas density and visual extinction. In
addition, we examine the extent to which the density and temperature
distributions depend on our choice of chemical model.
  We find that all of the models predict the same density PDF and also agree
very well on the form of the temperature PDF for temperatures T > 30 K,
although at lower temperatures, some differences become apparent. All of the
models also predict the same CO-to-H2 conversion factor, to within a factor of
a few. However, when we look more closely at the details of the CO
distribution, we find larger differences. The more complex models tend to
produce less CO and more atomic carbon than the simpler models, suggesting that
the C/CO ratio may be a useful observational tool for determining which model
best fits the observational data. Nevertheless, the fact that these chemical
differences do not appear to have a strong effect on the density or temperature
distributions of the gas suggests that the dynamical behaviour of the molecular
clouds on large scales is not particularly sensitive to how accurately the
small-scale chemistry is modelled.

  to Astronomy and Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201016068",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on the viscous disk theory, a number of recent studies have suggested
there is large scale meridional circulation in protoplanetary disks. Such a
flow could account for the presence of crystalline silicates, including
calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), at large distances from the sun.
This paper aims at examining whether such large-scale flows exist in turbulent
protoplanetary disks. High-resolution global hydrodynamical and
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of turbulent protoplanetary
disks were used to infer the properties of the flow in such disks. By
performing hydrodynamic simulations using explicit viscosity, we demonstrate
that our numerical setup does not suffer from any numerical artifact. The
aforementioned meridional circulation is easily recovered in viscous and
laminar disks and is quickly established. In MHD simulations, the
magnetorotational instability drives turbulence in the disks. Averaging out the
turbulent fluctuations on a long timescale, the results fail to show any
large-scale meridional circulation. A detailed analysis of the simulations show
that this lack of meridional circulation is due to the turbulent stress tensor
having a vertical profile different from the viscous stress tensor. A simple
model is provided that successfully accounts for the structure of the flow in
the bulk of the disk. In addition to those results, possible deviations from
standard vertically averaged alpha disk models are suggested by the simulations
and should be the focus of future work. Global MHD numerical simulations of
fully ionized and turbulent protoplanetary disks are not consistent with the
existence of a large-scale meridional flow. As a consequence, the presence of
crystalline silicates at large distance for the central star cannot be
accounted for by that process as suggested by recent models based on viscous
disk theory.

Two choices of the measure $M$ and polynomials are considered: 1) a $(N\times
N)$ matrix non-negative Borel measure on $\mathbb{R}$ and vector-valued
polynomials $p(x) = (p_0(x),p_1(x),...,p_{N-1}(x))$, $p_j(x)$ are complex
polynomials, $N\in \mathbb{N}$; 2) a scalar non-negative Borel measure in a
strip $\Pi = \{(x,\phi):\ x\in \mathbb{R}, \phi\in [-\pi,\pi) \} $, and
power-trigonometric polynomials: $p(x,\phi) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty
\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \alpha_{m,n} x^m e^{in\phi}$, $\alpha_{m,n}\in
\mathbb{C}$, where all but finite number of $\alpha_{m,n}$ are zeros. We prove
that polynomials are dense in $L^2(M)$ if and only if $M$ is a canonical
solution of the corresponding moment problem. Using descriptions of canonical
solutions, we get conditions for the density of polynomials in $L^2(M)$. For
this purpose, we derive a model for commuting self-adjoint and unitary
operators with a spectrum of a finite multiplicity.

and interesting applications, including ubiquitous healthcare and Consumer
Electronics (CE) applications. Since WBAN nodes are used to collect sensitive

require strict security mechanisms to prevent malicious interaction with the
system. In this paper, we first highlight major security requirements and
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in WBAN at Physical, Medium Access Control
(MAC), Network, and Transport layers. Then we discuss the IEEE 802.15.4
security framework and identify the security vulnerabilities and major attacks
in the context of WBAN. Different types of attacks on the Contention Access
Period (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP) parts of the superframe are
analyzed and discussed. It is observed that a smart attacker can successfully
corrupt an increasing number of GTS slots in the CFP period and can
considerably affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in WBAN (since most of the
data is carried in CFP period). As we increase the number of smart attackers
the corrupted GTS slots are eventually increased, which prevents the legitimate
nodes to utilize the bandwidth efficiently. This means that the direct
adaptation of IEEE 802.15.4 security framework for WBAN is not totally secure
for certain WBAN applications. New solutions are required to integrate high
level security in WBAN.

the dispersion relation and wave packet simulations of the Klein-Gordon
equation. We point out an apparent paradox between two (in principle
equivalent) pictures of black hole evaporation through Hawking radiation. In
the picture in which the evaporation is due to the emission of positive-energy
modes, one immediately obtains a threshold for the emission of massive
particles. In the picture in which the evaporation is due to the absorption of
negative-energy modes, such a threshold apparently does not exist. We resolve
this paradox by tracing the evolution of the positive-energy massive modes with
an energy below the threshold. These are seen to be emitted and move away from
the black hole horizon, but they bounce back at a ""red horizon"" and are
re-absorbed by the black hole, thus compensating exactly for the difference
between the two pictures. For astrophysical black holes, the consequences are
curious but do not affect the terrestrial constraints on observing Hawking
radiation. For analogue gravity systems with massive modes, however, the
consequences are crucial and rather surprising.

reconnected flux tubes may present elongated regions relatively devoid of
plasma, as well as long lasting, dense central hot regions. Reconnection is
assumed to happen in a small patch across a Syrovatski\'i (non-uniform) current
sheet (CS) with skewed magnetic fields. The background magnetic pressure has
its maximum at the center of the CS plane, and decreases toward the edges of
the plane. The reconnection patch creates two V-shaped reconnected tubes that
shorten as they retract in opposite directions, due to magnetic tension. One of
them moves upward toward the top edge of the CS, and the other one moves
downward toward the top of the underlying arcade. Rotational discontinuities
(RDs) propagate along the legs of the tubes and generate parallel super-sonic
flows that collide at the center of the tube. There, gas dynamics shocks that
compress and heat the plasma are launched outwardly. The descending tube moves
through the bottom part of the CS where it expands laterally in response to the
background magnetic pressure. This effect may decrease plasma density by 30 %
to 50 % of background levels. This tube will arrive at the top of the arcade
that will slow it down to a stop. Here, the perpendicular dynamics is halted,
but the parallel dynamics continues along its legs; the RDs are shut down, and
the gas is rarified to even lower densities. The hot postshock regions continue
evolving, determining a long lasting hot region on top of the arcade. We
provide an observational method based on total emission measure and mean
temperature, that indicates where in the CS the tube has been reconnected.

determining the input behavior, and specifically, a prior distribution which is
used to randomly generate the codebook. We pose the problem of setting the
prior as a sequential universal prediction problem, that attempts to approach a
given target rate, which depends on the unknown channel sequence. The main
result is that, for a channel comprised of an unknown, arbitrary sequence of
memoryless channels, there is a system using feedback and common randomness
that asymptotically attains, with high probability, the capacity of the
time-averaged channel, universally for every sequence of channels. While no
prior knowledge of the channel sequence is assumed, the rate achieved meets or
exceeds the traditional arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) capacity for every
memoryless AVC defined over the same alphabets, and therefore the system
universally attains the random code AVC capacity, without knowledge of the AVC
parameters. The system we present combines rateless coding with a universal
prediction scheme for the prior. We present rough upper bounds on the rates
that can be achieved in this setting and lower bounds for the redundancies.

overcome this lack of correlation decay by introducing a perturbative parameter

agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This
means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were
created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer
to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide
whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its
intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way.
The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the
execution of several environments, including those which are generated
randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once
the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter
will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and
rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a
result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible
environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to
determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests,
the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really
useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated
environment will serve that purpose.
