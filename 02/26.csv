macroscopic disordered systems. However, progress is hampered by the lack of
controlled experiments. Here we consider a model experiment for the isotropic
two-dimensional confinement of a rod by a central force. We seek to measure how
ordered is a folded configuration and we identify two key quantities. A
geometrical characterization is given by the number of superposed layers in the
configuration. Using temporal modulations of the confining force, we probe the
mechanical properties of the configuration and we define and measure its
effective compressibility. These two quantities may be used to build a
statistical framework for packed elastic systems.

charged particle passing through an external periodic field in a dispersive
medium. In the optical range of spectrum we will consider two cases: first, the
source has not eigenfrequency, and second, the source has eigenfrequency. In
the first case, when the Cherenkov radiation occurs, the non-zero
eigenfrequency produces a paradox for Doppler effect. It is shown that the
absence of the eigenfrequency solves the paradox known in the literature. The
question whether the process is normal (i.e. hard photons are being radiated
under the small angles) or anomalous depends on the law of the medium
dispersion. When the source has an eigenfrequency the Doppler effects can be
either normal or anomalous. In the X-ray range of the oscillator radiation
spectrum we have two photons radiated under the same angle- soft and hard. In
this case the radiation obeys to so-called complicated Doppler effect, i.e. in
the soft photon region we have anomalous Doppler effect and in the hard photon
region we have normal Doppler effect.

directly from line of sight magnetogram observations is presented. The
technique uses sequences of magnetograms directly as lower boundary conditions
to drive the evolution of coronal magnetic fields between successive force-free
equilibria over long periods of time. It is illustrated by applying it to MDI
observations of a decaying active region, NOAA AR 8005. The active region is
modeled during a 4 day period around its central meridian passage. Over this
time, the dispersal of the active region is dominated by random motions due to
small scale convective cells. Through studying the build up of magnetic energy
in the model, it is found that such small scale motions may inject anywhere
from $2.5-3 \times 10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of free magnetic energy into the
coronal field. Most of this energy is stored within the center of the active
region in the low corona, below 30 Mm. After 4 days the build-up of free energy
is 10% that of the corresponding potential field. This energy buildup, is
sufficient to explain the radiative losses at coronal temperatures within the
active region. Small scale convective motions therefore play an integral part
in the energy balance of the corona. This new technique has wide ranging
applications with the new high resolution, high cadence observations from the
SDO:HMI and SDO:AIA instruments.

highly constrained polynomial fits to be used in the extrapolation of hadron
masses to their physical values. Numerical results for the 2+1 flavour case
confirm the usefulness of this expansion and an extrapolation to the physical
pion mass gives hadron mass values to within a few percent of their
experimental values. Singlet quantities remain constant which allows the
lattice spacing to be determined from hadron masses (without necessarily being

from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our global luminosity function (down to
M_r<= -16) does not show the presence of an upturn at faint magnitudes, while
we do observe a strong dependence of its shape on both richness and
cluster-centric radius, with a brightening of M^* and an increase of the dwarf
to giant ratio with richness, indicating that more massive systems are more
efficient in creating/retaining a population of dwarf satellites. This is
observed both within physical (0.5 R_200) and fixed (0.5 Mpc) apertures,
suggesting that the trend is either due to a global effect, operating at all
scales, or to a local one but operating on even smaller scales. We further
observe a decrease of the relative number of dwarf galaxies towards the cluster
center; this is most probably due to tidal collisions or collisional disruption
of the dwarfs since merging processes are inhibited by the high velocity
dispersions in cluster cores and, furthermore, we do not observe a strong
dependence of the bright end on the environment. We find indication that the
dwarf to giant ratio decreases with increasing redshift, within 0.07<z<0.2. We
also measure a trend for stronger suppression of faint galaxies (below M^*+2)
with increasing redshift in poor systems, with respect to more massive ones,
indicating that the evolutionary stage of less massive galaxies depends more
critically on the environment. Finally we point out that the luminosity
function is far from universal; hence the uncertainties introduced by the
different methods used to build a composite function may partially explain the
variety of faint-end slopes reported in the literature as well as, in some
cases, the presence of a faint-end upturn.

splitting experimentally and theoretically in a range of confinement regimes.
We report measurements of the VO splitting in silicon quantum dot and donor

stellar evolution, supernovae, and galactic chemical evolution. We present the
evolution of the isotope ratios of elemental abundances (from C to Zn) in the
solar neighbourhood, bulge, halo, and thick disk, using chemical evolution
models with updated yields of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and
core-collapse supernovae. The evolutionary history of each element is different
owing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element
production. In the bulge and thick disk the star formation timescale is shorter
than in the solar neighbourhood, leading to higher [alpha/Fe] ratios. Likewise,
the smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to
lower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K,
Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element
production from core-collapse supernovae. According to our predictions, it is
possible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]>-1) that formed in the early Universe
as a result of rapid star formation. The chemical enrichment timescale of the
halo is longer than in the solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of
[(C, F)/Fe] and 12C/13C are higher owing to a significant contribution from
low-mass AGB stars. While the [alpha/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] ratios are the same as in
the solar neighbourhood, the [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K, Sc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] ratios are
predicted to be lower. Furthermore, we predict that isotope ratios such as
24Mg/25,26Mg are larger because of the contribution from low-metallicity
supernovae. Using isotopic ratios it is possible to select stars that formed in
a system with a low chemical enrichment efficiency such as the satellite
galaxies that were accreted onto our own Milky Way Galaxy.

the Rubakov-Shaposhnikov field-theoretical model, in which massless fermions
can be localized in a domain wall through the interaction of a scalar field, we
show that particle confinement may also take place if we endow the

the kind of interaction considered in the Rubakov-Shaposhnikov model is
replaced by the interaction of fermions with a geometric field, namely a Weyl

Although the pre- and post-annealed samples are usually well characterized, a
detailed investigation during annealing is necessary to reveal the role of
intermediate processes to produce a desirable composite. We present an
alternative method using in situ XANES to investigate the thermal evolution of
oleic acid and oleylamine coated Pt-rich FePt/Fe3O4 heterodimers. As the
temperature increases, a progressive reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO occurs helped by
the thermolysis of the surfactants; while above 550 K Fe3Pt starts to be
formed. At 840 K an abrupt increase of FeO further drives the phase
transformation to stabilize the iron platinum soft phase. Thus, the Fe3O4
reduction acts as catalyst that promotes the Fe and Pt interdiffusion between
the Pt-rich FePt and Fe3O4/FeO to form Fe3Pt instead of exchange coupled
FePt/Fe3O4 with hard magnetic properties. In addition, the role of the
interface of the heterodimer ends is discussed. The pre- and post-annealed

determine the boundaries of several magnetically ordered phases in the region
J2,J3\in [0,1], and find a sizable magnetically disordered region in between.
We characterize part of this magnetically disordered phase as a plaquette
valence bond crystal phase. At larger J2, we locate a sizable region in which
staggered valence bond crystal correlations are found to be important, either
due to genuine valence bond crystal ordering or as a consequence of
magnetically ordered phases which break lattice rotational symmetry.
Furthermore we find that a particular parameter-free Gutzwiller projected
tight-binding wave function has remarkably accurate energies compared to
finite-size extrapolated ED energies along the transition line from
conventional N\'eel to plaquette VBC phases, a fact that points to possibly
interesting critical behavior - such as a deconfined critical point - across

emission lines in a large number of planetary nebulae. Se is a potentially
useful tracer of neutron-capture nucleosynthesis, but accurate determinations
of its abundance in photoionized nebulae have been hindered by the lack of
atomic data governing its ionization balance. Our calculations were carried out
in intermediate coupling with semi-relativistic radial wavefunctions. PI and
recombination data were determined for levels within the ground configuration
of each ion, and experimental PI cross-section measurements were used to
benchmark our results. For DR, we allowed dn=0 core excitations, which are
important at photoionized plasma temperatures. DR is the dominant recombination
process for each of these Se ions at temperatures representative of
photoionized nebulae (~10^4 K). To estimate the uncertainties of these data, we
compared results from three different configuration-interaction expansions for
each ion, and tested the sensitivity of the results to the radial scaling
factors in the structure calculations. We find that the internal uncertainties
are typically 30-50% for the direct PI cross sections and ~10% for the computed
RR rate coefficients, while those for low-temperature DR can be considerably
larger (from 15-30% up to two orders of magnitude) due to the unknown energies
of near-threshold autoionization resonances. The results are suitable for
incorporation into photoionization codes used to numerically simulate
astrophysical nebulae, and will enable robust determinations of nebular Se

modeled by expanding the exchange interactions up to second order in powers of

lightcurves measured by RHESSI's X-ray detectors in the 6-12 keV and 12-25 keV
energy range during the decay phase of the flares of 2004 November 4 and 6.
Methods: The various motions of the RHESSI spacecraft which may contribute to
the manifestation of oscillations are studied. The response of each detector in
turn is also investigated. Results: We find that on 2004 November 6 the
observed oscillations correspond to the nutation period of the RHESSI
instrument. These oscillations are also of greatest amplitude for detector 5,
while in the lightcurves of many other detectors the oscillations are small or
undetectable. We also find that the variation in detector pointing is much
larger during this flare than the counterexample of 2004 November 4.
Conclusions: Sufficiently large nutation motions of the RHESSI spacecraft lead
to clearly observable oscillations in count rates, posing a significant hazard
for data analysis. This issue is particularly problematic for detector 5 due to
its design characteristics. Dynamic correction of the RHESSI counts, accounting
for the livetime, data gaps, and the transmission of the bi-grid collimator of
each detector, is required to overcome this issue. These corrections should be
applied to all future oscillation studies.

from a long-range potential due to neutrons in the Earth and the Sun that
distinguishes nu_mu and nu_tau on Earth, with a potential difference of ~
6*10^-14 eV, and changes sign for anti-neutrinos. We show that existing solar,
reactor, accelerator, and atmospheric neutrino oscillation constraints can be
largely accommodated for values of parameters that help explain the possible

atmospheric constraints. A long-range interaction, consistent with current
bounds, could have very pronounced effects on atmospheric neutrino

future high-precision long-baseline oscillation experiments that aim for +- 1%

experiments can extend the reach for new long-distance effects well beyond
current bounds and test their relevance to the aforementioned MINOS anomaly. We
also point out that long-range potentials originating from the Sun could lead
to annual modulations of neutrino data at the percent level, due to the

cryptochrome, has been suggested to endow birds with magnetoreceptive abilities

light-driven reaction cycle in cryptochrome that lets a magnetic field
influence the signaling state of the photoreceptor. The reaction cycle ties
together transient absorption and electron-spin-resonance observations with
known facts on avian magnetoreception. Our analysis establishes the feasibility
of cryptochrome to act as a geomagnetic compass in birds, gives insight into

are derived, which reveal a number of insights, including the impact of
correlation, of the number of antennas, of relay noise and of relaying
protocol. The effect of correlation is shown to be negligible, unless the
channel becomes almost fully correlated. The SNR loss of relay fading channels

is shown to depend not on a particular fading distribution, but rather on its
polynomial behavior near zero, and is the same for the simple

between the SNR-asymptotic DMT and the finite-SNR outage performance: while the
former is not improved by using an extra antenna on either side, the latter can
be significantly improved and, in particular, an extra antenna can be
traded-off for a full processing capability at the relay. The results are
extended to the multi-relay channels with selection relaying and typical outage

provides strong constraints on the luminosities of OB stars, assuming that
their association with the Carina Nebula, and hence their distance, is
confirmed. We fit model stellar atmospheres to the optical (UBV) and IR
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 182 OB stars with known spectral types
and measure the bolometric luminosity and extinction for each star. We find
that the extinction law measured toward the OB stars has two components:
Av=1--1.5 mag produced by foreground dust with a ratio of total-to-selective
absorption Rv=3.1 plus a contribution from local dust with Rv>4.0 in the Carina
molecular clouds that increases as Av increases. Using X-ray emission as a
strong indicator of association with Carina, we identify 94 candidate OB stars
with Lbol\geq10^4 Lsun by fitting their IR SEDs. If the candidate OB stars are
eventually confirmed by follow-up spectroscopic observations, the number of

removes the massless quark states but the resulting axion is visible. In order
to become realistic the model must be extended to account for massive quarks

a simple computational approximation to mitigate the numerical difficulties of
radiative transfer with PRD, and show that it reproduces the exact radiative
transfer solution to better than 10%. The lines predicted by our radiative
transfer model with PRD, including the H_2 density and temperature distribution
as a function of height in the atmosphere, are in agreement with the line
profiles observed by FUSE. We discuss the observational consequences of PRD,
and show that this computational method also allows us to include PRD in
modeling the continuum pumped H_2 fluorescence, treating about 4000 lines
simultaneously.

magnetic fields, is a powerful analytical tool for the determination of
molecular identity, structure, and function. With the advent of prepolarization
methods and alternative detection schemes using atomic magnetometers or
superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), NMR in very low-
(~earth's field), and even zero-field, has recently attracted considerable
attention. Despite the use of SQUIDs or atomic magnetometers, low-field NMR
typically suffers from low sensitivity compared to conventional high-field NMR.
Here we demonstrate direct detection of zero-field NMR signals generated via
parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP), enabling high-resolution NMR without
the use of any magnets. The sensitivity is sufficient to observe spectra
exhibiting 13C-1H J-couplings in compounds with 13C in natural abundance in a
single transient. The resulting spectra display distinct features that have
straightforward interpretation and can be used for chemical fingerprinting.

where a powerful AGN outburst created a large-scale cocoon shock. We
investigated possible azimuthal variations in shock strength and shape, finding
indications for a weak shock with a Mach number in the range ~1.2-1.3. We
measured the temperature change across the shock front. However, the detection
of a temperature rise in the regions immediately inside of the front is
complicated by the underlying temperature profile of the cluster atmosphere. We
measured the global temperature profile of the cluster up to 700 kpc, which
represents the farthest measurement obtained with Chandra for this cluster. A
""plateau"" in the temperature profile in the range ~70-150 kpc indicates the
presence of cool gas, which is likely the result of uplift of material by the
AGN outburst. After masking the cool filaments visible in the hardness ratio
map, the plateau disappears and the temperature profile recovers a typical
shape with a peak around 190 kpc, just inside the shock front. However, it is
unlikely that such a temperature feature is produced by the shock as it is
consistent with the general shape of the temperature profiles observed for
relaxed galaxy clusters. We studied the spectral properties of the cool
filaments finding evidence that ~10^11 M_sun of low-entropy material has been
dredged up by the rising lobes from the central 30 kpc to the observed current
position of 75-150 kpc. The energy required to lift the cool gas is >~2.2 x
10^60 erg, which is comparable to the work required to inflate the cavities and
is ~25% of the total energy of the large-scale shock. Our results show that the
AGN feedback in Hydra A is acting not only by directly heating the gas, but
also by removing a substantial amount of potential fuel for the SMBH.

(CRs) indicate great flexibility to improve the spectrum efficiency by
opportunistically accessing the authorized frequency bands. One of the critical
challenges for operating such radios in a network is how to efficiently
allocate transmission powers and frequency resource among the secondary users

users (PUs). In this paper, we focus on the non-cooperative power allocation
problem in cognitive wireless mesh networks (CogMesh) formed by a number of
clusters with the consideration of energy efficiency. Due to the SUs' selfish
and spontaneous properties, the problem is modeled as a stochastic learning
process. We first extend the single-agent Q-learning to a multi-user context,
and then propose a conjecture based multi-agent Qlearning algorithm to achieve
the optimal transmission strategies with only private and incomplete
information. An intelligent SU performs Q-function updates based on the
conjecture over the other SUs' stochastic behaviors. This learning algorithm
provably converges given certain restrictions that arise during learning
procedure. Simulation experiments are used to verify the performance of our
algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness of improving the energy efficiency.

adversary, Dodis and Wichs introduced the notion of a non-malleable extractor.
A non-malleable extractor dramatically strengthens the notion of a strong
extractor. A strong extractor takes two inputs, a weakly-random x and a
uniformly random seed y, and outputs a string which appears uniform, even given
y. For a non-malleable extractor nmExt, the output nmExt(x,y) should appear
uniform given y as well as nmExt(x,A(y)), where A is an arbitrary function with
A(y) not equal to y.
  We show that an extractor introduced by Chor and Goldreich is non-malleable
when the entropy rate is above half. It outputs a linear number of bits when
the entropy rate is 1/2 + alpha, for any alpha>0. Previously, no nontrivial
parameters were known for any non-malleable extractor. To achieve a polynomial
running time when outputting many bits, we rely on a widely-believed conjecture
about the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. Our
analysis involves a character sum estimate, which may be of independent
interest.
  Using our non-malleable extractor, we obtain protocols for ""privacy
amplification"": key agreement between two parties who share a weakly-random
secret. Our protocols work in the presence of an active adversary with
unlimited computational power, and have asymptotically optimal entropy loss.
When the secret has entropy rate greater than 1/2, the protocol follows from a
result of Dodis and Wichs, and takes two rounds. When the secret has entropy
rate delta for any constant delta>0, our new protocol takes a constant
(polynomial in 1/delta) number of rounds. Our protocols run in polynomial time
under the above well-known conjecture about primes.

show that there is a universal probability distribution function (pdf) for
detected SNR values, which implies that the most likely SNR value of the first
detected event will be 1.26 times the search threshold. For binary systems, I
also derive the universal pdf for detected values of the orbital inclination,
taking into account the Malmquist bias; this implies that the number of
gamma-ray bursts associated with detected binary coalescences should be 3.4
times larger than expected from just the beaming fraction of the gamma burst.
Using network antenna patterns, I propose three figures of merit that
characterize the relative performance of different networks... Adding {\em any}
new site to the planned LIGO-VIRGO network can dramatically increase, by
factors of 2 to 4, the detected event rate by allowing coherent data analysis
to reduce the spurious instrumental coincident background. Moving one of the
LIGO detectors to Australia additionally improves direction-finding by a factor
of 4 or more. Adding LCGT to the original LIGO-VIRGO network not only improves
direction-finding but will further increase the detection rate over the

Extended abstract will be published at STOC'11",,,"TIK report number 324","cs.CC cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore the fundamental limits of distributed balls-into-bins algorithms.
We present an adaptive symmetric algorithm that achieves a bin load of two in
log* n+O(1) communication rounds using O(n) messages in total. Larger bin loads
can be traded in for smaller time complexities. We prove a matching lower bound
of (1-o(1))log* n on the time complexity of symmetric algorithms that guarantee
small bin loads at an asymptotically optimal message complexity of O(n). For
each assumption of the lower bound, we provide an algorithm violating it, in
turn achieving a constant maximum bin load in constant time.
  As an application, we consider the following problem. Given a fully connected
graph of n nodes, where each node needs to send and receive up to n messages,
and in each round each node may send one message over each link, deliver all
messages as quickly as possible to their destinations. We give a simple and
robust algorithm of time complexity O(log* n) for this task and provide a
generalization to the case where all nodes initially hold arbitrary sets of
messages. A less practical algorithm terminates within asymptotically optimal
O(1) rounds. All these bounds hold with high probability.

l\nu$ have been extensively studied. In these references, the form factors and
differential decay rate are explicitly stated. However, we would like to stress
that in these papers the final state interactions are often overlooked, i.e.
rescattering effect of the pseudoscalars produced by $D_{l4}$ decay may be very
important, at least on the side of phase of form factors due to Watson's
theorem. In this short paper, we will display this rescattering effect in the
framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory, it thus must be a very
useful and indispensable supplement of the previous papers on $D_{l4}$ study.

thermodynamic approach based on existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states
or a saturation approach based on some version of the specification property. A
general framework incorporating the most important multifractal spectra was
introduced by Barreira and Saussol, who used the thermodynamic approach to
establish the multifractal formalism in the uniformly hyperbolic setting,
unifying many existing results. We extend this framework to apply to a broad
class of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, including examples with phase
transitions. In the process, we compare this thermodynamic approach with the
saturation approach and give a survey of many of the multifractal results in
the literature.

concerned with various processes changing the thermodynamic state of flow of a
real fluid and with reduction of these processes to processes having a given
temperature and pressure of a given real mixture at the inlet. It is shown that
all parameters of the process can be converted under condition of full
similarity of flow that is formulated in the paper. An operating point of a
compressor represents such process. It is to emphasize that parameters of the
reduced point include not only volume flow, speed and polytropic head, for
which a requirement of similarity of flow at inlet is sufficient, but also
polytropic exponent, polytropic efficiency, outlet pressure and outlet
temperature. This allows a conversion of all compressor characteristics. A
method for that is described.
