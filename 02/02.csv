block copolymers in aqueous solutions leads to the formation of colloidal
superstructures also termed 'colloidal complexes'. Their primary interest
relies in their monodispersity in size, and in their increased domain of
stability. In this review, the structural characterization by dynamic light
scattering, cryo-TEM, and small angle neutron scattering is presented. Small
angle neutron scattering results have been analyzed using numerical simulations
- Monte Carlo or reverse Monte Carlo (RMC). Such simulations are useful to show
the compatibility between different models of colloidal superstructures, and
experiment. Our results have allowed us to propose a generic structure of
complex colloids, made of a dense core of interacting colloids, bridged by
polyelectrolyte blocks, and a hydrated corona. We have shown that such
superstructures are formed systematically in these systems, with either
micelles or nanoparticles, for different copolymers, and different charges. The

present an n-partite inequality that is satisfied by all correlations produced

n-partite entangled states, such as GHZ states. In contrast to traditional
entanglement witnesses, the violation of this inequality implies that the state
is not biseparable independently of the Hilbert space dimension and of the

genuine multipartite non-locality. We show more generically how the problem of

is to study the properties of the strongly-interacting matter in the conditions
of high energy density (>10 GeV/fm3) and high temperature (> 0.3 GeV) expected
to be reached in central Pb\^aPb collisions. Charm and beauty quarks are a
powerful tool to investigate this high density and strongly interacting state
of matter as they are produced in initial hard scatterings, and due to their
long life time, they probe all the stages of the system evolution. The detector
design was optimized for heavy ions but is also well suited for pp studies.
ALICE recorded pp data at s= 7 TeV since march 2010 and the first run with
heavy ion collisions took place in November 2010. The measurement of charm
production cross section in pp collisions provides interesting insight into QCD
processes and is important as a reference for heavy ion studies. The
measurement of the D- meson yield in pp collisions can be used to extract the
charm cross section. In this contribution, the ongoing study of reconstruction
of D-mesons through hadronic decay channels and the first preliminary results
obtained with \sqrt{s}= 7 TeV pp data will be presented.

usually refers to subdivision problems. Such a method is only valid based on
dense sample points. The manifold usually needs to be triangulated into meshes
(or patches) and each node on the mesh will have an initial value. While the
mesh is refined the algorithm will provide a smooth function on the redefined
manifolds. However, when data points are not dense and the original mesh is not
allowed to be changed, how is the ""continuous and/or smooth"" reconstruction
possible? This paper will present a new method using harmonic functions to
solve the problem. Our method contains the following steps: (1) Partition the
boundary surfaces of the 3D manifold based on sample points so that each sample
point is on the edge of the partition. (2) Use gradually varied interpolation
on the edges so that each point on edge will be assigned a value. In addition,
all values on the edge are gradually varied. (3) Use discrete harmonic function
to fit the unknown points, i.e. the points inside each partition patch.
  The fitted function will be a harmonic or a local harmonic function in each
partitioned area. The function on edge will be ""near"" continuous (or ""near""
gradually varied). If we need a smoothed surface on the manifold, we can apply
subdivision algorithms. This paper has also a philosophical advantage over
triangulation meshes. People usually use triangulation for data reconstruction.
This paper employs harmonic functions, a generalization of triangulation
because linearity is a form of harmonic. Therefore, local harmonic
initialization is more sophisticated then triangulation. This paper is a
conceptual and methodological paper. This paper does not focus on detailed
mathematical analysis nor fine algorithm design.

background radiation (CMB), the relative abundances of primordial hydrogen,
deuterium and helium isotopes, and the large-scale structure of the universe
all indicate that 4.5% of the current mass density of the universe consists of
baryons. However, only a small fraction of these baryons can be accounted for
in stars and gas inside galaxies, galaxy groups and galaxy clusters, and in
spectral-line absorbing gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Too hot to show
up in Lyman-absorption, too cool to cause detectable spectral distortions of
the cosmic microwave background radiation, and too diffused to emit detectable
X-rays, about 90% of the cosmic baryons remain missing in the local universe
(redshift z~0). Here, we report on prevalent, isotropic, source independent,
and fairly uniform soft X-ray absorption along the lines of sight to high-z
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and quasars. It has the magnitude, redshift and energy
dependence that are expected from a hot IGM that contains the missing
cosmological baryons and has a mean metallicity similar to that in the
intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters.

of multiple devices, and (ii) adaptive regenerating codes which allow adapting
the parameters at each repair. Similarly to regenerating codes by Dimakis et
al., these codes achieve the optimal tradeoff between storage and the repair
bandwidth. Based on these extended regenerating codes, we study the impact of
lazy repairs applied to regenerating codes and conclude that lazy repairs
cannot reduce the costs in term of network bandwidth but allow reducing the
disk-related costs (disk bandwidth and disk I/O).

revealed an anomalous increase of the eccentricity of the lunar orbit amounting
to de/dt_meas = (9 +/- 3) 10^-12 yr^-1. The present-day models of the
dissipative phenomena occurring in the interiors of both the Earth and the Moon
are not able to explain it. We examine several dynamical effects, not modeled
in the data analysis, in the framework of long-range modified models of gravity
and of the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm. It turns out that none of
them can accommodate de/dt_meas. Many of them do not even induce long-term
changes in e; other models do, instead, yield such an effect, but the resulting
magnitudes are in disagreement with de/dt_meas. In particular, the general
relativistic gravitomagnetic acceleration of the Moon due to the Earth's
angular momentum has the right order of magnitude, but the resulting
Lense-Thirring secular effect for the eccentricity vanishes. A potentially
viable Newtonian candidate would be a trans-Plutonian massive object (Planet
X/Nemesis/Tyche) since it, actually, would affect e with a non-vanishing
long-term variation. On the other hand, the values for the physical and orbital
parameters of such a hypothetical body required to obtain the right order of
magnitude for de/dt are completely unrealistic. Moreover, they are in neat
disagreement with both the most recent theoretical scenarios envisaging the
existence of a distant, planetary-sized body and with the model-independent
constraints on them dynamically inferred from planetary motions. Thus, the
issue of finding a satisfactorily explanation for the anomalous behavior of the
Moon's eccentricity remains open.

and virialization shocks, during which the gas is shock-heated to temperatures
of $\sim10^4$ K, leading to potentially strong fluxes in the Lyman alpha line.
Indeed, a number of Lyman alpha blobs has been detected at high redshift. In
this letter, we explore the origin of such Lyman alpha emission using
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a detailed model of atomic
hydrogen as a multi-level atom and the effects of line trapping with the
adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH. We see that baryons fall into the center
of a halo through cold streams of gas, giving rise to a Lyman alpha luminosity
of at least $\rm 10^{44} erg s^{-1}$ at $\rm z=4.7$, similar to observed Lyman
alpha blobs. We find that a Lyman alpha flux of $\rm 5.0\times 10^{-17} erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ emerges from the envelope of the halo rather than its center,
where the photons are efficiently trapped. Such emission can be probed in
detail with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and will constitute
an important probe of gas infall and accretion.

dimension 3, this does not give us any information about the horizon of

introduce spaces of functions with surfaces of upper box dimension at most
\alpha, for \alpha $\in$ [2,3). In this setting the behaviour of the horizon is
more subtle. We construct a prevalent subset of these spaces where the lower
box dimension of the horizon lies between the dimension of the surface minus
one and 2. We show that in the sense of prevalence these bounds are as tight as
possible if the spaces are defined purely in terms of dimension. However, if we
work in Lipschitz spaces, the horizon property does indeed hold for prevalent
functions. Along the way, we obtain a range of properties of box dimensions of

images reach an emission line flux limit (5 sigma) of 1.5 x 10^-17 erg cm^-2

In this paper we identify a sample of [OII]3727 emission line objects at
redshift z~1.85 in a co-moving volume of ~4100 Mpc^3. Objects are selected
using an observed equivalent width (EW_obs) threshold of EW_obs = 50 angstroms.
The sample is used to derive the space density and constrain the luminosity
function of [OII] emitters at z=1.85. We find that the space density of objects
with observed [OII] luminosities in the range log(L_[OII]) > 41.74 erg s^-1 is
log(rho)=-2.45+/-0.14 Mpc^-3, a factor of 2 greater than the observed space
density of [OII] emitters reported at z~1.4. After accounting for completeness
and assuming an internal extinction correction of A_Halpha=1 mag (equivalent to
A_[OII]=1.87), we report a star formation rate density of rho* ~0.38+/-0.06
Msun yr^-1 Mpc^-3. We independently derive the dust extinction of the sample
using 24 micron fluxes and find a mean extinction of A_[OII]=0.98+/-0.11
magnitudes (A_Halpha=0.52). This is significantly lower than the A_Halpha=1
(A[OII]=1.86) mag value widely used in the literature. Finally we incorporate
this improved extinction correction into the star formation rate density
measurement and report rho*~0.24+/-0.06 Msun yr^-1 Mpc^-3.

symmetry breaking predicates (SBPs) it is possible to break symmetries in
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). The SBPs cut down the search space to the
nonsymmetric regions of the space without affecting the satisfiability of the
CNF formula. The symmetry breaking predicates are created by representing the
formula as a graph, finding the graph symmetries and using some symmetry
extraction mechanism (Crawford et al.). Here in this paper we take one
non-trivial CNF and explore its symmetries. Finally, we generate the SBPs and
adding it to CNF we show how it helps to prune the search tree, so that SAT
solver would take short time. Here we present the pruning procedure of the
search tree from scratch, starting from the CNF and its graph representation.
As we explore the whole mechanism by a non-trivial example, it would be easily
comprehendible. Also we have given a new idea of generating symmetry breaking
predicates for breaking symmetry in CNF, not derived from Crawford's
conditions. At last we propose a backtrack SAT solver with inbuilt SBP

compute the energy density radiated by a heavy quark undergoing some arbitrary

of that, the energy distribution shows the same space-time localization as the
classical radiation that would be produced by the heavy quark at weak coupling.
We believe that this and some other unnatural features of our result (like its
anisotropy and the presence of regions with negative energy density) are
artifacts of the supergravity approximation, which will be corrected after
including string fluctuations. For the case where the quark trajectory is
bounded, we also compute the radiated power, by integrating the energy density
over the surface of a sphere at infinity. For sufficiently large times, we find

formation of the misaligned bubbles. Also, X-ray spectra reveal that typically
these systems are also able to supress cooling flows, predicted theoretically.
The absence of cooling flows in galaxy clusters has been a mistery for many
years since numerical simulations and analytical studies suggest that AGN jets
are highly energetic, but are unable to redistribute it at all directions. We
performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a precessing
AGN jet and the warm intracluster medium plasma, which dynamics is coupled to a
NFW dark matter gravitational potential. Radiative cooling has been taken into
account and the cooling flow problem was studied. We found that precession is
responsible for multiple pairs of bubbles, as observed. The misaligned bubbles
rise up to scales of tens of kiloparsecs, where the thermal energy released by
the jets are redistributed. After $\sim 150$ Myrs, the temperature of the gas
within the cavities is kept of order of $\sim 10^7$ K, while the denser plasma
of the intracluster medium at the central regions reaches $T \sim 10^5$ K. The
existence of multiple bubbles, at diferent directions, result in an integrated
temperature along the line of sight much larger than the simulations of
non-precessing jets. This result is in agreement with the observations. The
simulations reveal that the cooling flows cessed $\sim 50 - 70$ Myr after the
AGN jets are started.

numerically obtain the surface electric potential and the counterions

the large importance of such corrections for moderate to high particle charges

During TNSA of protons from one area of the sphere surface, laterally spreading
hot electrons form a charge wave. Due to the spherical geometry, this wave
refocuses on the opposite side of the sphere, where an opening has been laser
micromachined. This leads to a strong transient charge separation field being
set up there, which can post-accelerate those TNSA protons passing through the
hole at the right time. Experimentally, the feasibility of using such targets
is demonstrated. A redistribution is encountered in the experimental proton
energy spectra, as predicted by particle-in-cell simulations and attributed to
transient fields set up by oscillating currents on the sphere surface.

social networks. We present a recently introduced formalism called TVG (for
time-varying graphs), which was initially developed to model and analyze
highly-dynamic and infrastructure-less communication networks such as mobile
ad-hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, or vehicular networks. We discuss
its applicability to complex networks in general, and social networks in
particular, by showing how it enables the specification and analysis of complex
dynamic phenomena in terms of temporal interactions, and allows to easily
switch the perspective between local and global dynamics. As an example, we
chose the case of scientific communities by analyzing portion of the ArXiv
repository (ten years of publications in physics) focusing on the social
determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions among individuals) behind
the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that
scientific communities are at the same time communities of practice (through
co-authorship) and that they exist also as representations in the scientists'
mind, since references to other scientists' works is not merely an objective
link to a relevant work, but it reveals social objects that one manipulates,

that for any observable that we wish to look at (including dynamical properties
or observables dependent on excited states) there is a corresponding functional
of the ground-state density. Yet the unavailability of such magic functionals
in many cases (the theorem is a non-constructive existence result) demands the
development and use of the alternative exact reformulation of quantum mechanics
provided by TDDFT. This theory defines a convenient route to electronic
excitations and to the dynamics of a many-electron system subject to an
arbitrary time-dependent perturbation. This is, in fact, the main purpose of
inscribing TDDFT in a MD framework -the inclusion of the effect of electronic
excited states in the dynamics. However, as we will show in this review, it may
not be the only use of TDDFT in this context. In this manuscript, we review two
recent proposals: In Section 1.2, we show how TDDFT can be used to design
efficient gsBOMD algorithms -even if the electronic excited states are in this

is presented that is physically based. The evolutionary track starts with an
event that triggers a significant starburst in the central region of a galaxy.
In this model, the main SMBH growth takes place in post-starburst phase fueled
by recycled gas from inner bulge stars in a self-regulated fashion on a time
scale that is substantially longer than 100Myrs and at a diminishing Eddington
ratio with time. We argue that the SMBH cannot gorge itself during the
starburst phase, despite the abundant supply of cold gas, because star
formation is a preferred mode of gas consumption in such an environment than
accretion to the central SMBH. We also show that feedback from star formation
is at least as strong as that from AGN and thus, if star formation is in need
of being quenched, AGN feedback generally does not play the primary role. The
predicted relation between SMBH mass and bulge mass/velocity dispersion is
consistent with observations. A clear prediction is that early-type galaxy
hosts of high Eddingtion rate AGNs are expected to be light-blue to green in
optical color, gradually evolving to the red sequences with decreasing AGN
luminosity. A suite of falsifiable predictions and implications with respect to
relationships between various types of galaxies and AGN, and others, are made.
For those where comparisons to extant observations are possible, the model
appears to be in good standing.

of non-locality and contextuality, in a setting which generalizes the familiar
probability tables used in non-locality theory to arbitrary measurement covers;
this includes Kochen-Specker configurations and more. We show that
contextuality, and non-locality as a special case, correspond exactly to
obstructions to the existence of global sections. We describe a linear
algebraic approach to computing these obstructions, which allows a systematic
treatment of arguments for non-locality and contextuality. We distinguish a
proper hierarchy of strengths of no-go theorems, and show that three leading
examples --- due to Bell, Hardy, and Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger,
respectively --- occupy successively higher levels of this hierarchy. A general
correspondence is shown between the existence of local hidden-variable
realizations using negative probabilities, and no-signalling; this is based on
a result showing that the linear subspaces generated by the non-contextual and
no-signalling models, over an arbitrary measurement cover, coincide. Maximal
non-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in
purely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the
support. A general setting is developed for Kochen-Specker type results, as
generic, model-independent proofs of maximal contextuality, and a new
combinatorial condition is given, which generalizes the `parity proofs'
commonly found in the literature. We also show how our abstract setting can be
represented in quantum mechanics. This leads to a strengthening of the usual
no-signalling theorem, which shows that quantum mechanics obeys no-signalling

gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The processes by which gravitational
energy is converted into turbulent and magnetic energies, however, remain
poorly understood. Here, we show with high-resolution, adaptive-mesh
simulations that MHD turbulence is efficiently driven by extracting energy from
the gravitational potential during the collapse of a dense gas cloud.
Compressible motions generated during the contraction are converted into
solenoidal, turbulent motions, leading to a natural energy ratio of E_sol/E_tot
of approximately 2/3. We find that the energy injection scale of gravity-driven
turbulence is close to the local Jeans scale. If small seeds of the magnetic
field are present, they are amplified exponentially fast via the small-scale
dynamo process. The magnetic field grows most efficiently on the smallest
scales, for which the stretching, twisting, and folding of field lines, and the
turbulent vortices are sufficiently resolved. We find that this scale
corresponds to about 30 grid cells in the simulations. We thus suggest a new
minimum resolution criterion of 30 cells per Jeans length in
(magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating gas, in order to
resolve turbulence on the Jeans scale, and to capture minimum dynamo
amplification of the magnetic field. Due to numerical diffusion, however, any
existing simulation today can at best provide lower limits on the physical
growth rates. We conclude that a small, initial magnetic field can grow to
dynamically important strength on time scales significantly shorter than the
free-fall time of the cloud.

fixed point is characterized by a lack of oscillations in the eccentricities

point is dictated by mutual interactions among the planets as well as
non-Keplerian effects. We show that if a roughly coplanar system hosts a hot,

interactions and non-Keplerian effects in the equations of motion leads to a
direct determination of the true masses of the planets. Consequently, a

highlight unusual possibilities that emerge in even the simplest models. In one
example with a pure SU(N) hidden sector, stable hidden gluinos freeze out with
the correct relic density, but have an extremely low, but natural, confinement
scale, providing a framework for self-interacting dark matter. In another
simple scenario, hidden gluinos freeze out and decay to visible Winos with the
correct relic density, and hidden glueballs may either be stable, providing a
natural framework for mixed cold-hot dark matter, or may decay, yielding
astrophysical signals. Last, we present a model with light hidden pions that

parameters, are consistent with gauge coupling unification, preserve the
beautiful connection between the weak scale and the observed dark matter relic
density, and are natural, with relatively light visible superpartners. We
conclude with comments on interesting future directions.

compare it with observations from six galaxy catalogues (NVSS, HEAO, 2MASS, and
SDSS main galaxies, luminous red galaxies, and quasars). We sample the value of
the speed of sound and perform a likelihood analysis, finding that the UDM
model is as likely as the LambdaCDM, and is compatible with observations for a
range of values of c_\infinity (the value of the sound speed at late times) on
which structure formation depends. In particular, we obtain an upper bound of
c_\infinity^2 \leq 0.009 at 95% confidence level, meaning that the LambdaCDM
model, for which c_\infinity^2 = 0, is a good fit to the data, while the
posterior probability distribution peaks at the value c_\infinity^2=10^(-4) .
Finally, we study the time dependence of the deviation from LambdaCDM via a
tomographic analysis using a mock redshift distribution and we find that the
largest deviation is for low-redshift sources, suggesting that future low-z
surveys will be best suited to constrain UDM models.

Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission at z~3 in the SSA22a field. We employ a custom
narrowband filter centered at 3640A (NB3640), which probes the LyC region for
galaxies at z>3.06. We also analyze new and archival NB4980 imaging tuned to
the wavelength of the Lya emission line at z=3.09, and archival broadband B, V,
and R images of the non-ionizing UV continuum. Our NB3640 images contain 26
z>3.06 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) as well as a set of 130 Lya emitters (LAEs),
identified by their excess NB4980 flux relative to the BV continuum. Six LBGs
and 28 LAEs are detected in the NB3640 image. LBGs appear to span a range of
NB3640-R colors, while LAEs appear bimodal in their NB3640-R properties. We
estimate average UV to LyC flux density ratios, corrected for foreground
contamination and intergalactic medium absorption, finding
<F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LBG} = 11.3^{+10.3}_{-5.4}, which implies a LBG LyC escape
fraction f_{esc}^{LyC} ~ 0.1, and <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LAE} = 2.2^{+0.9}_{-0.6}.
The strikingly blue LAE flux density ratios defy interpretation in terms of
standard stellar population models. Assuming <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LBG} applies
down to L=0.1L*, we estimate a galaxy contribution to the intergalactic
hydrogen ionization rate that is consistent with independent estimates based on
the Lya forest opacity at z~3. If we assume that <F_{UV}/F_{LyC}>^{LAE} holds
at the faintest luminosities, the galaxy contribution significantly exceeds
that inferred from the Lya forest. Further follow-up study of these faint LAEs
is crucial, given the potentially important contribution similar objects make
to the process of reionization. (Abridged)

studied using CO observations. We identified 142 dense clumps within our sample
and found that our sources are divided into two categories: those with clumps
that show a power law size-line width relation (Type I) and those which do not
show any relation (Type II). The clumps in the Type I sources have larger power
law indices than found in previous studies. The clumps in the Type II sources
have larger line widths and show evidence (such as outflows) of current active
star formation within the clump. We suggest that the lack of a size-line width
relation is a sign of current active star formation. Massive clumps seem to
have similar masses calculated by different methods but lower mass clumps have
larger virial masses compared to velocity integrated and LTE mass. We found no
relation between mass distribution of the clumps and distance from the H~II
region ionization front, but a weak decrease of the excitation temperature with
increasing distance from the ionized gas. The clumps in collected shells around
the H~II regions have slightly larger line widths but no relation was found
between line width and distance from the H~II region, which probably indicates
that the internal dynamics of the clumps are not affected by the ionized gas.
Internal sources of turbulence, such as outflows and stellar winds from young
proto-stars may have a more important role on the molecular gas dynamics. We
suggest that large line width and larger size-line width power law indices are
therefore the initial characteristics of clumps in massive star forming clouds
and that some may evolve into objects similar to our Type II sources, where
local ""second generation"" stars are forming and eliminating the size-line-width
relation.

facto standard for the combination of images taken by the Hubble Space Tele-
scope. However, the drizzle algorithm was developed with small, faint,
partially resolved sources in mind, and is not the best possible algorithm for
high signal-to-noise unresolved objects. Here, a new method for creating
band-limited images from undersampled data is presented. The method uses a
drizzled image as a first order approximation and then rapidly converges toward
a band-limited image which fits the data given the statistical weighting
provided by the drizzled image. The method, named iDrizzle, for iterative
Drizzle, effectively eliminates both the small high-frequency artifacts and
convolution with an interpolant kernel that can be introduced by drizzling. The
method works well in the presence of geometric distortion, and can easily
handle cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other missing data. It can combine images
taken with random dithers, though the number of dithers required to obtain a
good final image depends in part on the quality of the dither placements.
iDrizzle may prove most beneficial for producing high-fidelity point spread
functions from undersampled images, and could be particularly valuable for
future Dark Energy missions such as WFIRST and EUCLID, which will likely
attempt to do high precision supernova photometry and lensing experiments with
undersampled detectors.

of probing regions of SUSY parameter space exhibiting qualitatively new
collider phenomenology. Here we investigate one such region in which first
generation squarks are very heavy compared to the other superpartners. We find
that the production of these squarks, which is dominantly associative, only
becomes rate-limited at mSquark > 4(5) TeV for L~10(100) fb-1. However,
discovery of this scenario is complicated because heavy squarks decay primarily
into a jet and boosted gluino, yielding a dijet-like topology with missing
energy (MET) pointing along the direction of the second hardest jet. The result
is that many signal events are removed by standard jet/MET anti-alignment cuts
designed to guard against jet mismeasurement errors. We suggest replacing these
anti-alignment cuts with a measurement of jet substructure that can
significantly extend the reach of this channel while still removing much of the
background. We study a selection of benchmark points in detail, demonstrating
that mSquark= 4(5) TeV first generation squarks can be discovered at the LHC

observations and analysis presented provide a tantalizing look at solar
activity in the absence of large-scale flux emergence, offering insight into
times of ""extreme"" solar minimum and general behavior such as the phasing and
cross-dependence of different components of the spectral irradiance. Given that
the modulation of the supergranular scale imprints itself in variations of the
Sun's spectral irradiance, as well as in the mass and energy transport into the

understanding the impact of the quiet sun on the heliospheric system.

superconductors in detail. The Hall coefficient (RH) of FeTe and Fe(Se1-xTex)
exhibits a similar positive value around 300 K, indicating that the
high-temperature normal state is dominated by hole-channel transport. FeTe
exhibits a sign reversal from positive to negative across the transition to the
low-temperature antiferromagnetic state, indicating the occurrence of drastic
reconstruction in the band structure. The mobility analysis using the carrier
density theoretically calculated reveals that the mobility of holes is strongly
suppressed to zero, and hence the electric transport looks to be dominated by
electrons. The Se substitution to Te suppresses the antiferromagnetic
long-range order and induces superconductivity instead. The similar mobility
analysis for Fe(Se0.4Te0.6) and Fe(Se0.5Te0.5) thin films shows that the
mobility of electrons increases with decreasing temperature even in the
paramagnetic state, and keeps sufficiently high values down to the
superconducting transition temperature. From the comparison between FeTe and
Fe(Se1-xTex), it is suggested that the coexistence of 'itinerant' carriers both
in electron and hole channels is indispensable for the occurrence of
superconductivity.

by two shells at 43"" and 50"" from the central star detected in optical

data, we obtain the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of the thermal
emission from the detached shell of U Ant in a wide infrared spectral range of
15- 160 {\mu}m. Thermal emission of amorphous carbon grains with a single
temperature cannot account for the observed SED from 15 to 160 {\mu}m: it
underestimates the emission at 15 {\mu}m. Alternatively, the observed SED is
fitted by the model that amorphous carbon grains in the two shells have
different temperatures of 60 and 104 K, which allocates most dust mass in the
shell at 50"". This supports previous suggestion that the 43"" shell is gas-rich
and the 50"" one is dust-rich. We suggest a possibility that the segregation of
the gas and dust resulting from the drift motion of submicron-sized dust grains
relative to the gas and that the hot dust component associated with the

extremely small value at around the nucleosynthesis epoch, remains in that

temperature anisotropy to form, and then starts to grow in magnitude at the
redshift $z$ of $\sim 1$, followed by a damping oscillation which is required

realize such behavior of the scalar field, we have found it necessary to

in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), in log (Z)$, and in height above the
galactic plane. Comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means
indicate that in most regions of the CMD, our classifications are reliable
within about +/- 200 K and +/- 0.4 dex in log (g). It is difficult to assess
the reliability of our log(Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it
is poor, particularly at extreme Teff. Of great importance for the Kepler
Mission, for Teff <= 5400 K, the distinction between main-sequence stars and
giants has proved to be reliable with better than 98% confidence. The KIC is
available through the MAST data archive.

$d=2$ conformal field theory. Recently an explanation of this representation
inside the CFT framework was given through the assumption about the existence
of the special orthogonal basis in the module of algebra
$\mathcal{A}=Vir\otimes\mathcal{H}$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of
the infinite set of commuting integrals of motion. It was also proven that some
of these vectors take form of Jack polynomials. In this note we conjecture and
verify by explicit computations that in the case of the Virasoro central charge
$c=1$ all basis vectors are just the products of two Jack polynomials. Each of
the commuting integrals of motion becomes the sum of two integrals of motion of
two noninteracting Calogero models. We also show that in the case $c\neq1$ it
is necessary to use two different Feigin-Fuks bosonizations of the Virasoro
algebra for the construction of all basis vectors which take form of one Jack
polynomial.

Formally this occurs because the in-plane magnetic field appears as a vector

removed by a gauge transformation of the surface electron wavefunctions. Here
we show that when the top and bottom surfaces of a thin film of TI are
hybridized and the Fermi level is in the hybridization gap, a nonzero

An application of the second law of thermodynamics involving two subsystems in

average and fluctuation of the transition time, and the peak value of the
second moment of the mass flux exhibit power-law divergences at the critical
point and these variables satisfy scaling relationships near the critical
point. Dependences of the critical width and exponents on peristaltic velocity

then there exist either a positive (negative) potential solitary wave or a
positive (negative) potential double layer at M= Mc. Result-2: If the system

there does not exist positive (negative) potential solitary wave at M= Mc.

potential solitary structures (including double layers) at M= Mc. Apart from
the conditions of Result-1, the double layer solution at M= Mc is possible only

suggested, according to which each sensor transmits only one-bit messages at
stopping times of its local filtration. The proposed estimator is shown to be
consistent and, for a large class of processes, asymptotically optimal, in the
sense that its asymptotic distribution is the same as the exact distribution of
the optimal estimator that has full access to the sensor observations. These
properties are established under an asymptotically low rate of communication

is a desirable property in many applications. Finally, the case of discrete

about a signal. The range of applications includes communication-systems to
DNA-sequencing. If there is interference present on a transmitted signal, it
could be due to a natural cause or superimposed forcefully. In the latter case,
its early detection and analysis becomes important. In such situations having a
small observation window, a quick look at power-spectrum can reveal a great
deal of information, including frequency and source of interference. In this
paper, we present our design of a FPGA based reconfigurable platform for high
performance power-spectrum analysis. This allows for the real-time
data-acquisition and processing of samples of the incoming signal in a small
time frame. The processing consists of computation of power, its average and
peak, over a set of input values. This platform sustains simultaneous data
streams on each of the four input channels.

supports general quantum operators, together with its pushdown, counter, and
finite automaton variants, and examine the computational power of classical and
quantum machines using small space bounds in many different cases. The main
contributions are summarized below.
  Firstly, we consider QTMs in the unbounded error setting: (i) in some cases
of sublogarithmic space bounds, the class of languages recognized by QTMs is
shown to be strictly larger than that of classical ones; (ii) in constant space
bounds, the same result can still be obtained for restricted QTMs; (iii) the
complete characterization of the class of languages recognized by realtime
constant space nondeterministic QTMs is given.
  Secondly, we consider constant space-bounded QTMs in the bounded error
setting: (i) we introduce a new type of quantum and probabilistic finite
automata (QFAs and PFAs, respectively,) with a special two-way input head which
is not allowed to be stationary or move to the left but has the capability to
reset itself to its starting position; (ii) the computational power of this
type of quantum machine is shown to be superior to that of the probabilistic
machine; (iii) based on these models, two-way PFAs and two-way classical-head
QFAs are shown to be more succinct than two-way nondeterministic finite
automata and their one-way variants; (iv) we also introduce PFAs and QFAs with
postselection with their bounded error language classes, and give many
characterizations of them.
  Thirdly, the computational power of realtime QFAs augmented with a write-only
memory is investigated by showing many simulation results for different kinds
of counter automata.
  Finally, some lower bounds of realtime classical Turing machines in order to
recognize a nonregular language are shown to be tight.

stellar models using both a perturbative and a two-dimensional approach. A
comparison between the two yields validity domains which are similar to those
previously obtained in Reese, Lignieres and Rieutord (2006) for polytropic
models. One can also construct validity domains based on polynomial fits to the
frequencies from the two-dimensional approach, and these also turn out to be
similar, thus further confirming the agreement between the perturbative and
two-dimensional approach at low rotation rates. Furthermore, as was previously
shown in Espinosa, Perez Hernandez and Roca Cortes (2004), adjacent frequencies
in multiplets come close together, thus forming pairs. This phenomena,
exclusive to two-dimensional calculations, is shown to be an unlikely
explanation of the close frequency pairs observed in delta Scuti stars. A
systematic search for all close frequency pairs in the calculated spectrum is
also carried out. The number of close frequency pairs is shown to agree with
what is expected based on a Poisson distribution, but does not match the number
or distribution of close pairs in stars like FG Vir. Furthermore, a lack of
close frequency pairs appears at low rotation rates, where frequency multiplets
do not overlap. Delta Scuti stars currently reported as having close frequency
pairs do not fall in this interval.

evolution. I will concentrate on the thermal and non-thermal continuum emission
from early-type stars. The thermal radio emission is due to free-free
interactions in the ionized stellar wind material. Early ideas that this would
lead to an easy and straightforward way of measuring the mass-loss rates were
thwarted by the presence of clumping in the stellar wind. Multi-wavelength
observations provide important constraints on this clumping, but do not allow
its full determination. Non-thermal radio emission is associated with binarity.
This conclusion was already known for some time for Wolf-Rayet stars and in
recent years it has become clear that it is also true for O-type stars. In a
massive-star binary, the two stellar winds collide and around the shocks a
fraction of the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds. Spiralling in
the magnetic field these electrons emit synchrotron radiation, which we detect
as non-thermal radio emission. The many parameters that influence the resulting
non-thermal radio fluxes make the modelling of these systems particularly
challenging, but their study will provide interesting new insight into massive
stars.

production by solar wind capture is very small today it may have been
significant during the first billion years after planetary formation because
solar wind was much stronger at that time and Earth magnetospheric
configuration may have been different. We estimate that the contribution of
solar wind hydrogen to the Earth water reserves can be up to 10% when we assume

elements are reported. The investigated resonant elements include plain slotted
cylinders as well as various their combinations, in particular, Russian doll or
Matryoshka configurations. The acoustic band structure and transmission
characteristics of such systems have been computed with the use of finite
element methods. The general concept of a locally resonant sonic crystal is
proposed, which utilises acoustic resonances to form additional band gaps that
are decoupled from Bragg gaps. An existence of a separate attenuation mechanism
associated with the resonant elements, which increases performance in the lower
frequency regime has been identified. The results show a formation of broad
band gaps positioned significantly below the first Bragg frequency. For low
frequency broadband attenuation a most optimal configuration is the Matryoshka
sonic crystal, where each scattering unit is composed of multiple concentric
slotted cylinders. This system forms numerous gaps in the lower frequency
regime, below Bragg bands, whilst maintaining a reduced crystal size viable for
noise barrier technology. The finding opens new perspectives for construction
of sound barriers in the low frequency range usually inaccessible by
traditional means including conventional sonic crystals.

One of our most significant findings is evidence for a flattening in the radial
GC number density profile in the outer halo. Intriguingly, this occurs at a
galactocentric radius of ~2 degrees (~30 kpc) which is the radius at which the
underlying stellar halo surface density has also been shown to flatten. The GCs
which lie beyond this radius are remarkably uniform in terms of their blue
(V-I)o colours, consistent with them belonging to an ancient population with
little to no metallicity gradient. Structural parameters are also derived for a
sample of 13 newly-discovered extended clusters (ECs) and we find the lowest
luminosity ECs have magnitudes and sizes similar to Palomar-type GCs in the
Milky Way halo. We argue that our findings provide strong support for a

representation of the function $A^*(t)$, which minimizes a weighted
$L^2$-distance between the logarithm of the copula $C(y^{1-t},y^t)$ and
functions of the form $A(t)\log(y)$ is derived. If the unknown copula is an
extreme-value copula, the function $A^*(t)$ coincides with Pickands dependence
function. Moreover, even if this is not the case, the function $A^*(t)$ always
satisfies the boundary conditions of a Pickands dependence function. The
estimators are obtained by replacing the unknown copula by its empirical
counterpart and weak convergence of the corresponding process is shown. A
comparison with the commonly used estimators is performed from a theoretical

six epochs of VLBA monitoring at 5 GHz. Additionally, we compare kinematic
results obtained with two imaging methods based on different deconvolution
algorithms. The blazar 0716+714 has a diffuse large-scale jet and a very faint
bright compact core. Experiments with simulated data showed that the
conventional data reduction procedure based on the CLEAN deconvolution
algorithm does not perform well in restoring this type of structure. This might
be the reason why previous kinematic studies of this source yielded ambiguous
results. In order to obtain accurate kinematics of this source, we
independently applied two imaging techniques to the raw data: the conventional
method, based on difference mapping, which uses CLEAN deconvolution, and the
generalized maximum entropy method (GMEM) realized in the VLBImager package
developed at the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia. The results of both methods
give us a consistent kinematic scenario: the large-scale jet of 0716+714 is
diffuse and stationary. Differences between the inner (0-1 mas) and outer (1-12
mas) regions of the jet in brightness and velocity of the components could be
explained by the bending of the jet, which causes the angle between the jet
direction and the line of sight to change from ~5 deg to ~11 deg. For the
source 0716+714 both methods worked at the limit of their capability.

is reached at all finite temperatures and therefore we can consider jumps from

aging studies. We show that the evolution of the energy following the
Kovacs-protocol can approximately be expressed as a difference of two
monotonously decaying functions and thus show the existence of a so-called
Kovacs hump whenever these functions are not single exponentials. It is well
established that the Kovacs effect also occurs in the linear response regime
and we show that most of the gross features do not change dramatically when
large temperature jumps are considered. However, there is one distinguishing
feature that only exists beyond the linear regime which we discuss in detail.
For the memory experiment with 'inverted' temperatures, i.e. jumping up and
then down again, we find a very similar behavior apart from an opposite sign of
the hump.

identified by their characteristic thermal radio emission, which is manifest in
their spectral index at centimeter wavelengths. The host galaxies in our sample
were selected based upon their likelihood of harboring young star formation. In
star-forming regions, the ionizing flux of massive embedded stars powers the
dominant thermal free-free emission of those sources, resulting in a spectral
index of {\alpha} {\gtrsim} -0.2 (where S{\nu} {\propto} {\nu}{\alpha}), which
we compute. With the current sensitivity, we find that of the 25 galaxies in
this sample only five have radio sources with spectral indices that are only
consistent with a thermal origin; four have radio sources that are only
consistent with a non-thermal origin; six have radio sources whose nature is
ambiguous due to uncertainties in the spectral index; and sixteen have no
detected radio sources. For those sources that appear to be dominated by
thermal emission, we infer the ionizing flux of the star clusters and the
number of equivalent O7.5 V stars that are required to produce the observed
radio flux densities. The most radio-luminous clusters that we detect have an
equivalent of ~7x103 O7.5 V stars, and the smallest only have an equivalent of
~102 O7.5 V stars; thus these star-forming regions span the range of large

double field theory, we construct a Yang-Mills action which is covariant under
O(D,D) T-duality rotation and invariant under three-types of gauge
transformations: non-Abelian Yang-Mills, diffeomorphism and one-form gauge
symmetries. In double field formulation, in a manifestly covariant manner our
action couples a single O(D,D) vector potential to the closed string double
field theory. In terms of undoubled component fields, it couples a usual
Yang-Mills gauge field to an additional one-form field and also to the closed
string background fields which consist of a dilaton, graviton and a two-form
gauge field. Our resulting action resembles a twisted Yang-Mills action.

plasma, a state of matter at very high temperatures. Among a plethora of
particles that are produced in these collisions, also light is emitted
throughout the evolution of the plasma.
  In this talk, the properties of this light are discussed and related to
recent efforts towards shorter and more energetic photon pulses in laser
physics. In particular, the time evolution of high-energy photons is studied.
These photons originate from Compton scattering of gluons and quark-antiquark
annihilation in the plasma. Due to the internal dynamics of the plasma, double
pulses at the yoctosecond time scale can be generated under certain conditions.
Such double pulses may be utilized for novel pump-probe experiments at nuclear
time scales.

this magnetic contribution. The derived ponderomotive force generalizes the

have not been conducted yet. Thus, we used two different experimental methods
to produce micrometer-sized water ice particles, i. e. by spraying water
droplets into liquid nitrogen and by spraying water droplets into a cold
nitrogen atmosphere. The mean particle radii of the ice particles produced with
these experimental methods are $(1.49 \pm 0.79) \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ and $(1.45

ice particles are highly porous (volume filling factor: $\phi = 0.11 \pm 0.01$)

the method of production. Furthermore, the critical rolling friction force of
$F_{Roll,ice}=(114.8 \pm 23.8) \times 10^{-10}\, \mathrm{N}$ was measured for

force of micrometer-sized $\mathrm{SiO_2}$ particles ($F_{Roll,SiO_2}=(12.1 \pm

the emissivity law with a steep profile in the inner regions of the disc (index
7.8) and then a flat region between 5.6rg and 34.8rg before tending to a
constant index of 3.3 over the outer regions of the disc. The form of the

challenge is to understand the evolution from a conventional metal at high
doping to a strongly correlated metal near the Mott insulator at zero doping.
To this end, we solve the cellular dynamical mean-field equations for the
two-dimensional Hubbard model using a plaquette as the reference quantum
impurity model and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method as impurity
solver. The normal-state phase diagram as a function of interaction strength
$U$, temperature $T$, and filling $n$ shows that, upon increasing $n$ towards
the Mott insulator, there is a surface of first-order transition between two
metals at nonzero doping. That surface ends at a finite temperature critical
line originating at the half-filled Mott critical point. Associated with this
transition, there is a maximum in scattering rate as well as thermodynamic
signatures. These findings suggest a new scenario for the normal-state phase
diagram of the high temperature superconductors. The criticality surmised in
these systems can originate not from a T=0 quantum critical point, nor from the
proximity of a long-range ordered phase, but from a low temperature transition
between two types of metals at finite doping. The influence of Mott physics
therefore extends well beyond half-filling.

atmospheric properties using transmission spectrsocopy, and in the case of

been reconstructed opening a new range of possibilities. AIMS. In this
contribution we highlight the importance to account for the orbital
eccentricity and longitude of periastron of the planetary orbit to accurately
interpret the measured planetary radial velocity during the transit. Methods:
We calculate the radial velocity of a transiting planet in an eccentric orbit.
Given the larger orbital speed of planets with respect to their stellar
companions even small eccentricities can result in detectable blue or redshift
radial velocity offsets during the transit with respect to the systemic
velocity, the exact value depending also on the longitude of the periastron of
the planetary orbit. For an hot-jupiter planet, an eccentricity of only e=0.01
can produce a radial velocity offset of the order of the km/s. Conclusions: We
propose an alternative interpretation of the recently claimed radial velocity
blueshift (~2 km/s) of the planetary spectral lines of HD209458b which implies
that the orbit of this system is not exactly circular. In this case, the
longitude of the periastron of the stellar orbit is most likely confined in the
first quadrant (and that one of the planet in the third quadrant). We highlight
that transmission spectroscopy allows not only to study the compositional
properties of planetary atmospheres, but also to refine their orbital
parameters and that any conclusion regarding the presence of windflows on
planetary surfaces coming from transmission spectroscopy measurements requires
precise known orbital parameters from RV.

We assume that the agents are identical, and move in synchronous rounds.
  We first show that if the delay between the starting times of the agents is

known upper bound of O(log n) bits for rendezvous in arbitrary graphs of size

memory that solve the rendezvous problem in all trees with at most n nodes and
at most L leaves. Hence, for the class of trees with polylogarithmically many
leaves, there is an exponential gap in minimum memory size needed for
rendezvous between the scenario with arbitrary delay and the scenario with
delay zero. Moreover, we show that our upper bound is optimal by proving that
Omega(log L + loglog n)$ bits of memory are required for rendezvous, even in
the class of trees with degrees bounded by 3.

reveal unusual elastic instabilities due to the phonon-spin coupling within the
antiferromagnetic phase. Shear moduli exhibit anomalies arising from the
coupling to short-range ferromagnetic excitations. Diplike anomalies in the
magnetic-field dependence of elastic moduli reveal magnetic-field-induced
orbital order-order transitions. These results strongly suggest the presence of
geometrical orbital frustration which causes novel orbital phenomena within the
antiferromagnetic phase.

encyclopedic acception, measuring the semantic flow between the different
entries of the largest modern encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and thus creating a
directed complex network of semantic flows. Notably at the percolation
threshold the semantic space is characterised by scale-free behaviour at
different levels of complexity and this relates the semantic space to a wide
range of biological, social and linguistics phenomena. In particular we find
that the cluster size distribution, representing the size of different semantic
areas, is scale-free. Moreover the topology of the resulting semantic space is
scale-free in the connectivity distribution and displays small-world
properties. However its statistical properties do not allow a classical
interpretation via a generative model based on a simple multiplicative process.
After giving a detailed description and interpretation of the topological
properties of the semantic space, we introduce a stochastic model of
content-based network, based on a copy and mutation algorithm and on the Heaps'
law, that is able to capture the main statistical properties of the analysed
semantic space, including the Zipf's law for the word frequency distribution.
