Waals approach proposed by Grimme, known as the DFT-D2 method. Graphene
physisorbed on metal has the linear dispersion preserved in the band-structure,
but the Fermi level of the system is shifted with respect to the conical points
which results in a doping effect. We show that the type and amount of doping
depends not only on the choice of the exchange-correlation functional used in
the calculations, but also on the supercell geometry that models the physical
system. We analyzed how the factors such as the in-plane cell parameter and
interlayer spacing in gold influence the Fermi level shift and we found that
even a small variation in these parameters may cause a transition from p-type
to n-type doping. We have selected a reasonable set of model parameters and
obtained that graphene is either undoped or at most slightly p-type doped on
the clean Au(111) surface, which seems to be in line with experimental
findings. On the other hand, modifications of the substrate lattice may induce
larger doping up to 0.30-0.40 eV depending on the graphene-metal adsorption
distance. The sensitivity of the graphene-gold interface to the structural
parameters may allow to tune doping across the samples which could lead to
possible applications in graphene-based electronic devices. We believe that the
present remarks can be also useful for other studies based on the periodic DFT.

the sky in an energy band (15-150 keV) which is only marginally affected by
X-ray extinction, thus allowing for the search of long periodicities in the

a period search using the folding technique in the Swift-BAT light curves of
three Integral sources: IGR J05007-7047, IGR J13186-6257 and IGR J17354-3255.
Their periodograms show significant peaks at 30.77$\pm$0.01 d, 19.994$\pm$0.01

probability less than 1.5$\times10^{-4}$ that the detections occurred due to
chance. We complement our analysis with the study of their broadband X-ray
emission. We identify the periodicities with the orbital periods of the
sources. The periods are typical for the wind accretors X-ray binaries and we
support this identification showing that also their energy spectra are
compatible with an X-ray spectral emission characteristic of high-mass X-ray

classification for cases when the dataset is large enough to render its

of active set update rules and hyperparameter optimization based upon marginal
likelihood maximization. The active set update rules rely on the ability of the
predictive distributions of a Gaussian process classifier to estimate the
relative contribution of a datapoint when being either included or removed from
the model. This means that we can use it to include points with potentially
high impact to the classifier decision process while removing those that are
less relevant. We introduce two active set rules based on different criteria,
the first one prefers a model with interpretable active set parameters whereas
the second puts computational complexity first, thus a model with active set
parameters that directly control its complexity. We also provide both
theoretical and empirical support for our active set selection strategy being a
good approximation of a full Gaussian process classifier. Our extensive

frequencies of giant planets inside $\sim$ 3 AU than lower mass stars,
consistent with giant planet formation by core accretion. Direct imaging
searches have begun to discover significant numbers of giant planet candidates
around stars with masses of $\sim$ 1 $M_\odot$ to $\sim$ 2 $M_\odot$ at orbital
distances of $\sim$ 20 AU to $\sim$ 120 AU. Given the inability of core
accretion to form giant planets at such large distances, gravitational
instabilities of the gas disk leading to clump formation have been suggested as
the more likely formation mechanism. Here we present five new models of the
evolution of disks with inner radii of 20 AU and outer radii of 60 AU, for
central protostars with masses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 $M_\odot$, in
order to assess the likelihood of planet formation on wide orbits around stars
with varied masses. The disk masses range from 0.028 $M_\odot$ to 0.21
$M_\odot$, with initial Toomre $Q$ stability values ranging from 1.1 in the
inner disks to $\sim 1.6$ in the outer disks. These five models show that disk
instability is capable of forming clumps on time scales of $\sim 10^3$ yr that,
if they survive for longer times, could form giant planets initially on orbits
with semimajor axes of $\sim$ 30 AU to $\sim$ 70 AU and eccenticities of $\sim$
0 to $\sim$ 0.35, with initial masses of $\sim 1 M_{Jup}$ to $\sim 5 M_{Jup}$,
around solar-type stars, with more protoplanets forming as the mass of the
protostar (and protoplanetary disk) are increased. In particular, disk
instability appears to be a likely formation mechanism for the HR 8799 gas

ROBotic systems (DSLRob'10) was held at the 2010 IEEE/RSJ International
Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'10), October 2010 in Taipei,
Taiwan.
  The main topics of the workshop were domain-specific languages and models. A
domain-specific language (DSL) is a programming language dedicated to a
particular problem domain that offers specific notations and abstractions that
increase programmer productivity within that domain. Models offer a high-level
way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right
level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for
programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a
separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a
holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,
uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional
general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language
features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,
systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and
precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the
robotics domain.

M33 (ChASeM33). With a total exposure time of 1.4 Ms, ChASeM33 covers ~70% of
the D25 isophote (R\approx4kpc) of M33 and provides the deepest, most complete,
and detailed look at a spiral galaxy in X-rays. The source catalog includes 662
sources, reaches a limiting unabsorbed luminosity of ~2.4x10^(34) erg/s in the
0.35-8.0keV energy band, and contains source positions, source net counts,
fluxes and significances in several energy bands, and information on source
variability. The analysis challenges posed by ChASeM33 and the techniques
adopted to address these challenges are discussed. To constrain the nature of
the detected X-ray source, hardness ratios were constructed and spectra were
fit for 254 sources, followup MMT spectra of 116 sources were acquired, and
cross-correlations with previous X-ray catalogs and other multi-wavelength data
were generated. Based on this effort, 183 of the 662 ChASeM33 sources could be
identified. Finally, the luminosity function for the detected point sources as
well as the one for the X-ray binaries in M33 is presented. The luminosity
functions in the soft band (0.5-2.0 keV) and the hard band (2.0-8.0 keV) have a
limiting luminosity at the 90% completeness limit of 4.0x10^(34) erg/s and
1.6x10^(35) erg/s (for D=817kpc), respectively, which is significantly lower
than what was reported by previous X-ray binary population studies in galaxies
more distant than M33. The resulting distribution is consistent with a dominant
population of high mass X-ray binaries as would be expected for M33.

determined by the payoffs it obtains upon playing the game with its neighbors.
Since defection yields the highest individual benefits, the outlook for
cooperators is gloomy. While network reciprocity promotes collaborative
efforts, chances of averting the impending social decline are slim if the
temptation to defect is strong. It is therefore of interest to identify viable
mechanisms that provide additional support for the evolution of cooperation.
Inspired by the fact that the environment may be just as important as
inheritance for individual development, we introduce a simple switch that
allows a player to either keep its original payoff or use the average payoff of
all its neighbors. Depending on which payoff is higher, the influence of either
option can be tuned by means of a single parameter. We show that, in general,
taking into account the environment promotes cooperation. Yet coveting the
fitness of one's neighbors too strongly is not optimal. In fact, cooperation
thrives best only if the influence of payoffs obtained in the traditional way
is equal to that of the average payoff of the neighborhood. We present results
for the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game, for different levels of
uncertainty governing the strategy adoption process, and for different
neighborhood sizes. Our approach outlines a viable route to increased levels of
cooperative behavior in structured populations, but one that requires a
thoughtful implementation.

and observer frequencies from low radio (75 MHz) to X-ray (1.5 keV). We
summarize the light curves through smooth power law fits with up to three
breaks, covering jet breaks for small observer angles, the rising phase for
large observer angles and the rise and decay of the counterjet. All light curve
data are publicly available via http://cosmo.nyu.edu/afterglowlibrary . The
data can be used for model fits to observational data and as an aid for
predicting observations by future telescopes such as LOFAR or SKA and will
benefit the study of neutron star mergers using different channels, such as
gravitational wave observations with LIGO or Virgo.
  For small observer angles, we find jet break times that vary significantly
between frequencies, with the break time in the radio substantially postponed.
Increasing the observer angle also postpones the measured jet break time. The
rising phase of the light curve for large observer angle has a complex shape
that can not always be summarized by a simple power law. Except for very large
observer angles, the counter jet is a distinct feature in the light curve,
although in practice the signal will be exceedingly difficult to observe by
then.

postulating that the acceleration of a test particle orbiting a central body,
in addition to usual Newtonian component, contains a small additional radial
term proportional to the radial projection vr of the velocity of the particle's
orbital motion. Indeed, it induces secular variations of both the semi-major
axis a and the eccentricity e of the test particle's orbit. In the case of the
Earth and the Moon, they numerically agree rather well with the measured

from nucleons and pions in the heat bath. In the intermediate mass region, the

into account as well. When the system is sufficiently dilute, the hydrodynamic
description breaks down and a transition to a final cascade stage is performed.
In this stage dimuon emission is evaluated as commonly done in transport
models. Focusing on the enhancement with respect to the contribution from
long-lived hadron decays after freezout observed at the SPS in the low mass
region of the dilepton spectra, the relative importance of the different
thermal contributions and of the two dynamical stages is investigated. We find
that three separated regions can be identified in the invariant mass spectra.
Whereas the very low and the intermediate mass regions mostly receive
contribution from the thermal dilepton emission, the region around the vector
meson peak is dominated by the cascade emission. Above the rho-peak region the
spectrum is driven by QGP radiation. Analysis of the dimuon transverse mass
spectra reveals that the thermal hadronic emission shows an evident mass
ordering not present in the emission from the QGP.

in protein levels for genetically identical cells. Such variability in protein
levels can arise from infrequent synthesis of mRNAs which in turn give rise to
bursts of protein expression. Protein expression occurring in bursts has indeed
been observed experimentally and recent studies have also found evidence for
transcriptional bursting, i.e. production of mRNAs in bursts. Given that there
are distinct experimental techniques for quantifying the noise at different
stages of gene expression, it is of interest to derive analytical results
connecting experimental observations at different levels. In this work, we
consider stochastic models of gene expression for which mRNA and protein
production occurs in independent bursts. For such models, we derive analytical
expressions connecting protein and mRNA burst distributions which show how the
functional form of the mRNA burst distribution can be inferred from the protein
burst distribution. Additionally, if gene expression is repressed such that
observed protein bursts arise only from single mRNAs, we show how observations
of protein burst distributions (repressed and unrepressed) can be used to
completely determine the mRNA burst distribution. Assuming independent
contributions from individual bursts, we derive analytical expressions
connecting means and variances for burst and steady-state protein
distributions. Finally, we validate our general analytical results by
considering a specific reaction scheme involving regulation of protein bursts
by small RNAs. For a range of parameters, we derive analytical expressions for
regulated protein distributions that are validated using stochastic
simulations. The analytical results obtained in this work can thus serve as
useful inputs for a broad range of studies focusing on stochasticity in gene
expression.

seen in 30 nebulae out of 40 of our sample, selected on the basis of their
infrared flux. HST images and UVES spectra show that the mixed chemistry is not
related to the presence of emission-line stars, as it is in the Galactic disk
population. We also rule out interaction with the ISM as origin of the PAHs.
Instead, a strong correlation is found with morphology, and the presence of a
dense torus. A chemical model is presented which shows that hydrocarbon chains
can form within oxygen-rich gas through gas-phase chemical reactions. The model
predicts two layers, one at $A_V\sim 1.5$ where small hydrocarbons form from
reactions with C$^+$, and one at $A_V\sim 4$, where larger chains (and by
implication, PAHs) form from reactions with neutral, atomic carbon. These
reactions take place in a mini-PDR. We conclude that the mixed chemistry

unknown Internet topologies. Its main advantage over random walks and other
exploration techniques is that a BFS sample is a plausible graph on its own,
and therefore we can study its topological characteristics. However, it has
been empirically observed that incomplete BFS is biased toward high-degree
nodes, which may strongly affect the measurements. In this paper, we first
analytically quantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we
calculate the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a
function of the fraction f of covered nodes, in a random graph RG(pk) with an
arbitrary degree distribution pk. We also show that, for RG(pk), all commonly
used graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, Snowball Sampling, RDS)
suffer from exactly the same bias. Next, based on our theoretical analysis, we
propose a practical BFS-bias correction procedure. It takes as input a
collected BFS sample together with its fraction f. Even though RG(pk) does not
capture many graph properties common in real-life graphs (such as
assortativity), our RG(pk)-based correction technique performs well on a broad
range of Internet topologies and on two large BFS samples of Facebook and Orkut
networks. Finally, we consider and evaluate a family of alternative correction
procedures, and demonstrate that, although they are unbiased for an arbitrary
topology, their large variance makes them far less effective than the
RG(pk)-based technique.

uncertainties in astronomical analyses, systematic instrumental uncertainties
have been generally ignored. This can be crucial to a proper interpretation of
analysis results because instrumental calibration uncertainty is a form of
systematic uncertainty. Ignoring it can underestimate error bars and introduce
bias into the fitted values of model parameters. Accounting for such
uncertainties currently requires extensive case-specific simulations if using
existing analysis packages. Here we present general statistical methods that
incorporate calibration uncertainties into spectral analysis of high-energy
data. We first present a method based on multiple imputation that can be
applied with any fitting method, but is necessarily approximate. We then
describe a more exact Bayesian approach that works in conjunction with a Markov
chain Monte Carlo based fitting. We explore methods for improving computational
efficiency, and in particular detail a method of summarizing calibration
uncertainties with a principal component analysis of samples of plausible
calibration files. This method is implemented using recently codified Chandra
effective area uncertainties for low-resolution spectral analysis and is
verified using both simulated and actual Chandra data. Our procedure for
incorporating effective area uncertainty is easily generalized to other types
of calibration uncertainties.

focusing on the dynamical formation of BH-BH binaries, which are very important
sources of gravitational waves (GW). We examine the properties of these BH-BH
binaries through direct N-body computations of Plummer clusters, having
initially N(0) <= 10^5 low mass stars and a population of stellar mass BHs,
using the state-of-the-art N-body integrator ""NBODY6"". We find that the stellar
mass BHs segregate rapidly into the cluster core to form a central dense
sub-cluster of BHs in which BH-BH binaries form via 3-body encounters. While
most of the BH binaries finally escape from the cluster by recoils due to
super-elastic encounters with the single BHs, we find that for clusters with
N(0) >= 5 X 10^4, typically a few of them dynamically harden to the extent that
they can merge via GW emission within the cluster. Also, for each of such
clusters, there are a few escaped BH binaries that merge within a Hubble time,
most of the mergers happening within a few Gyr of cluster evolution. These
results imply that the intermediate-aged massive clusters constitute the most
important class of star clusters that can produce dynamical BH-BH mergers at
the present epoch. The BH-BH merger rates obtained from our computations imply
a significant detection rate (~ 30/yr) for the ""Advanced LIGO"" GW detector that
will become operative in the near future. Finally, we briefly discuss our
ongoing development on this work incorporating the formation of BHs in star
clusters from stellar evolution. In particular, we highlight the effect of
stellar metallicity on the BH sub-cluster driven expansion of a star cluster's
core.

extended, rotating gas disks in these four galaxies. Assuming dust correction
factors as high as A(H-alpha)=4.8 mag, the observations suggest lower limits on
the black hole masses of (1 - 9) x 10^8 solar masses, and star formation rates
<100 solar masses per year. The black hole masses and star formation rates of
the sample galaxies appear low in comparison to other high-z galaxies with
similar host luminosities. We explore possible explanations for these
observations including, host galaxy fading, black hole growth, and the shut
down of star formation.

weak lensing, forming a possible supercluster at redshift 0.45. Through
multi-colour wide-field imaging with CFHT/Megaprime and INT/WFC we identify
early-type galaxies and trace the supercluster network with them. Through
EMMI/NTT multi-object spectroscopy we verify the initial shear-selected cluster
candidates. Using weak lensing we obtain mass estimates for the supercluster
centre and the filaments.
  Results: We identified the centre of the SCL2243-0935 supercluster, MACS
J2243-0935, which was found independently by Ebeling et al. (2010). 13 more
clusters or overdensities are embedded in a filamentary network, half of them
are already spectroscopically confirmed. Three (5-15) Mpc filaments are
detected, and we estimate the global size of SCL2243 to 45x15x50 Mpc, making it
one of the largest superclusters known at intermediate redshifts. Weak lensing
yields r_200=(2.06+/-0.13) Mpc and M_200=(1.54+/-0.29)x10^15 M_sun for MACS
J2243 with M/L=428+/-82, very similar to results from size-richness cluster
scaling relations. Integrating the weak lensing surface mass density over the
supercluster network (defined by increased i-band luminosity or g-i colours),
we find (1.53+/-1.01)x10^15 M_sun and M/L=305+/-201 for the three main
filaments, consistant with theoretical predictions. The filaments' projected
surface mass density is 0.007-0.012, corresponding to 10-100 times the critical
density. The greatly varying density of the cosmic web is also reflected in the
mean colour of galaxies. Conclusions: SCL2243 is significantly larger and much
more richly structured than other known superclusters such as A901/902 or
MS0302 studied with weak lensing before. It is a text-book supercluster with
little contamination along the line of sight, making it a perfect sandbox for
testing new techniques probing the cosmic web.

remains sensitive to CO-dark envelopes of H2 surrounding molecular clouds. In M

consistent with the Milky Way value within the uncertainties. The two lowest
metallicity galaxies in our sample, NGC 6822 and the SMC (12 + log(O/H) \approx

\alpha_NGC6822 \approx 30 M_sun/pc^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1 and \alpha_SMC \approx 70

a mechanism to form planetesimals. Dissipation from gas drag introduces secular
GI, which proceeds even when standard GI criteria for a critical density or
Toomre's $Q$ predict stability. We include the stabilizing effects of turbulent
diffusion, which suppresses small scale GI. The radially wide rings that do
collapse contain up to $\sim 0.1$ Earth masses of solids. Subsequent
fragmentation of the ring (not modeled here) would produce a clan of chemically
homogenous planetesimals. Particle radial drift time scales (and, to a lesser
extent, disk lifetimes and sizes) restrict the viability of secular GI to disks
with weak turbulent diffusion, characterized by $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$. Thus
midplane dead zones are a preferred environment. Large solids with radii
$\gtrsim 10$ cm collapse most rapidly because they partially decouple from the
gas disk. Smaller solids, even below $\sim$ mm-sizes could collapse if
particle-driven turbulence is weakened by either localized pressure maxima or
super-Solar metallicity. Comparison with simulations that include particle
clumping by the streaming instability shows that our linear model underpredicts
rapid, small scale gravitational collapse. Thus the inclusion of more detailed
gas dynamics promotes the formation of planetesimals. We discuss relevant
constraints from Solar System and accretion disk observations.

has strong emission lines typical of a host-diluted Type 2 Seyfert galaxy. In
neither source do we observe polarized emission lines, with 3-sigma upper
limits of P_BLR < 2%. This means that the missing broad emission lines (and
weaker narrow emission lines) are not due to simple anisotropic obscuration,
e.g., by the canonical AGN torus. The weak-lined optically dull AGN exhibits a

Going beyond mean field we find that quantum fluctuation effects can explain
two unusual features of these materials that have attracted considerable
attention. First, why iron telluride orders magnetically at a non-nesting
wave-vector $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ and not at the nesting wave-vector $(\pi, 0)$ as
in the iron arsenides, even though the nominal band structures of both these
systems are similar. And second, why the $(\pi, 0)$ magnetic transition in the

These are robust properties of the model, independent of microscopic details,
and they emphasize the importance of the magneto-elastic interaction.

commercial aquaculture and recreational fisheries. Little published data is
available on length-weight relationships of channel catfish in Michigan. Though
there is no record of public or private stocking, channel catfish appeared in
Lake Diane between 1984 and 1995 and it has developed into an excellent
fishery. Results: NLLS regression yields parameter estimates of b = 3.2293 and
a = 0.00522. The improved model yields the same estimate for the exponent, b,
and a length estimate (parameter L1) of 45.23 cm. Estimates of uncertainty and
covariance are smaller for the improved model, but the correlation coefficient
is r = 0.995 in both cases. LLS regression produced different parameter values,
a = 0.01356 and b = 2.9726, and a smaller correlation coefficient, r = 0.980.
On average, catfish in the sample weighed 106.0% of the standard weight, (Brown
et al.) and the linear regression (no slope) of fillet yield vs. total weight
suggests a typical fillet yield of 28.1% with r = 0.989. Conclusion: Most of
the fish in the sample were above the standard weight, heavier than the 75th
percentile for their length. Channel catfish are doing well in Lake Diane and
the population is well matched to the food supply. Management should attempt to
maintain current population levels. In this case, the improved length-weight
model, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, provided lower uncertainties in parameter estimates and
smaller covariance than the traditional model.

early-type galaxies of the volume-limited Atlas3D sample, with the goal of
connecting their star formation and assembly histories to their cold gas
content. This is the largest volume-limited CO survey of its kind and is the
first to include many Virgo Cluster members. Sample members are dynamically hot
galaxies with a median stellar mass 3\times 10^{10} Msun; they are selected by
morphology rather than colour, and the bulk of them lie on the red sequence.
The overall CO detection rate is 56/259 = 0.22 \error 0.03, with no dependence
on K luminosity and only a modest dependence on dynamical mass. There are a
dozen CO detections among the Virgo Cluster members; statistical analysis of
their H_2 mass distributions and their dynamical status within the cluster
shows that the cluster's influence on their molecular masses is subtle at best,
even though (unlike spirals) they seem to be virialized within the cluster. We
suggest that the cluster members have retained their molecular gas through
several Gyr residences in the cluster. There are also a few extremely CO-rich
early-type galaxies with H_2 masses >= 10^9 Msun, and these are in low density
environments. We do find a significant trend between molecular content and the
stellar specific angular momentum. The galaxies of low angular momentum also
have low CO detection rates, suggesting that their formation processes were
more effective at destroying molecular gas or preventing its re-accretion. We

Metrics based on the random walk have been used in many applications from image

modeling and analyzing social networks? We argue that unlike a random walk,
which conserves the quantity diffusing on a network, many interesting social
phenomena, such as the spread of information or disease on a social network,
are fundamentally non-conservative. When an individual infects her neighbor
with a virus, the total amount of infection increases. We classify diffusion
processes as conservative and non-conservative and show how these differences
impact the choice of metrics used for network analysis, as well as our
understanding of network structure and behavior. We show that Alpha-Centrality,
which mathematically describes non-conservative diffusion, leads to new
insights into the behavior of spreading processes on networks. We give a
scalable approximate algorithm for computing the Alpha-Centrality in a massive
graph. We validate our approach on real-world online social networks of Digg.
We show that a non-conservative metric, such as Alpha-Centrality, produces
better agreement with empirical measure of influence than conservative metrics,
such as PageRank. We hope that our investigation will inspire further
exploration into the realms of conservative and non-conservative metrics in

shaping of planetary nebulae (PN). Starting from the assumption that
non-spherical PN cannot be formed by single stars, he linked PN morphologies to
the binary mechanisms that may have formed them, basing these connections
almost entirely on observational arguments. In light of the last decade of
discovery in the field of PN, we revise this framework, which, although
simplistic, can still serve as a benchmark against which to test theories of PN
origin and shaping. Within the framework, we revisit the role of planets in
shaping PN. Soker invoked a planetary role in shaping PN because there are not
enough close binaries to shape the large fraction of non-spherical PN. In this
paper we adopt a model whereby only ~20% of all 1-8 solar mass stars make a PN.
This reduces the need for planetary shaping. Through a propagation of
percentages argument, and starting from the assumption that planets can only
shape mildly elliptical PN, we conclude, like in Soker, that ~20% of all PN
were shaped via planetary and other substellar interactions but we add that
this corresponds to only ~5% of all 1-8 solar mass stars. This may be in line
with findings of planets around main sequence stars. PN shaping by planets is
made plausible by the recent discovery of planets that have survived
interactions with red giant branch (RGB) stars. Finally, we conclude that of
the ~80% of 1-8 solar mass stars that do not make a PN, about one quarter do
not even ascend the AGB due to interactions with stellar and substellar
companions, while three quarters ascend the AGB but do not make a PN. Once
these stars leave the AGB they evolve normally and can be confused with
post-RGB, extreme horizontal branch stars. We propose tests to identify them.

quantum correlations existing in quantum systems, which are of paramount
importance in quantum-information theory. Traditionally, they have been
regarded as identical (equivalent, in fact, for pure two qubit states, that is,
{\it Gisin's Theorem}), yet they constitute different resources. Describing
nonlocality by means of the violation of several Bell inequalities, we obtain
by direct optimization those states of two qubits that maximally violate a Bell
inequality, in terms of their degree of mixture as measured by either their
participation ratio $R=1/Tr(\rho^2)$ or their maximum eigenvalue
$\lambda_{max}$. This optimum value is obtained as well, which coincides with
previous results. Comparison with entanglement is performed too. An example of
an application is given in the XY model. In this novel approximation, we also
concentrate on the nonlocality for linear combinations of pure states of two
qubits, providing a closed form for their maximal nonlocality measure. The case
of Bell diagonal mixed states of two qubits is also extensively studied.
Special attention concerning the connection between nonlocality and
entanglement for mixed states of two qubits is paid to the so called maximally
entangled mixed states. Additional aspects for the case of two qubits are also
described in detail. Since we deal with qubit systems, we will perform an
analogous study for three qubits, employing similar tools. Relation between
distillability and nonlocality is explored quantitatively for the whole space

its frequency derivatives. The model accurately tracks the gravitational wave
phase from a rapidly decelerating neutron star under the restrictive but
computationally unavoidable assumption of constant braking index, an issue
which has hindered previous searches for such young objects. The theoretical
sensitivity is calculated and compared to the indirect, age-based wave strain
upper limit. The age-based limit lies above the detection threshold in the
frequency band 75\,Hz $\lesssim \nu \lesssim 450$\,Hz. The semi-coherent phase
metric is also calculated and used to estimate the optimal search template
spacing for the search. The range of search parameters that can be covered

chemically peculiar stars, called mercury-manganese (HgMn), is non-magnetic.
Nevertheless, chemical inhomogeneities were recently discovered on their

detected by modern studies. The goals of our study are to search for magnetic
field in the HgMn binary system 66 Eri and to investigate chemical spots on the
stellar surfaces of both components. Our analysis is based on high quality
spectropolarimetric time-series observations obtained during 10 consecutive
nights with the HARPSpol instrument at the ESO 3.6-m telescope. To increase the
sensitivity of the magnetic field search we employed a least-squares
deconvolution (LSD). We used spectral disentangling to measure radial
velocities and study line profile variability. Chemical spot geometry was
reconstructed using multi-line Doppler imaging. We report a non-detection of
magnetic field in 66 Eri, with error bars 10-24 G for the longitudinal field.
Circular polarization profiles also do not indicate any signatures of complex
surface magnetic fields. For a simple dipolar field configuration we estimated
an upper limit of the polar field strength to be 60-70 G. For the HgMn
component we found variability in spectral lines of Ti, Ba, Y, and Sr with the
rotational period equal to the orbital one. The surface maps of these elements
reconstructed with the Doppler imaging technique, show relative underabundance
on the hemisphere facing the secondary component. The contrast of chemical

in the 1960s. Since then, visible optics including spatial light modulators
(SLMs), array detectors and femtosecond lasers have become widely available,
routinely allowing versatile and computer-interfaced imposition of optical
phase, molecular coherent control, and detection. Today, high brilliance X-ray
sources begin to offer opportunities for atomic resolution and ultrafast
pump-probe studies. Correspondingly, this work considers an overlooked aspect
of Bragg's X-ray microscope - the incoherent ionizing radiation to coherent
visible (IICV) conversion that is a necessary prerequisite for coherent optical
computations. Technologies are suggested that can accomplish this conversion.
Approaches to holographic data storage of short wavelength scattered radiation
data, and phase retrieval that incorporates optical procedures, are motivated.

our model predictions we conclude that for polymeric particles the surface
pressure cannot be modelled directly by inert particles that interact via some
effective potential. Internal degrees of freedom within gel particles are
all-important. Consequently, the surface pressure of a fully packed layer is
not proportional to kT/d^2, where d is the particle diameter; but proportional
to kT/dm^2, where dm is the size of the molecular units that make up the
particle. This increases the surface pressure and modulus by some four orders
of magnitude. For short range interaction we study the dynamic behaviour, and
find fractal-like structures at low concentrations. At intermediate coverage an
irregular structure is formed that resembles a spinodal system. This system
freezes, which arrests the spinodal structure. At high surface coverage the
simulations show poly-crystalline domains. For dilute systems, the strength of
the surface layers is determined by simulated compression and expansion. We
find a power law for the surface pressure (Pi ~ Gamma^10+/-0.5), which is
related to the (fractal) structure of the adsorbed network. The power law is
consistent with surface percolation.

dominant penguin and two tree diagrams; the color-favored and color suppressed
diagrams. Previous analyzes confirmed the model with errors leaving values of
interference terms less that two standard deviations from zero. The observation
CP violation in $B^o\to K^\pm\pi^{\mp}$ decays indicates a finite value for
$P\cdot T$. New precise data analysis show $P\cdot T$ and $P\cdot S$
interference contributions well above errors. Their contributions to $B^\pm\to
K\pi$ decays are shown to be nearly equal with opposite phase and cancel within
experimental errors. This cancelation unexpected in previous analyzes explains
the failure to see CP violation in $B^\pm\to K\pi$ decays. It can be due to the
Pauli antisymmetry exchange neglected in previous analyzes. Two $B^\pm\to K\pi$
tree diagrams differ by interchange of two identical $u$ quarks. $B^o\to
K^\pm\pi^{\mp}$ diagrams have no identical quark pairs. This Pauli effect
explains the difference produced by changing the flavor of the spectator quark
which does not participate in the weak interaction. Our analysis differs from
previous analyzes which assume SU(3) flavor symmetry to use input from $B\to
\pi\pi$ data and neglect Pauli effects. We use new data, include Pauli effects

hierarchical hoppings and random on-site energies, has been studied in the
mathematical literature since its introduction by Bovier [J. Stat. Phys. 59,
745 (1990)], with the conclusion that this model is always in the localized
phase. Here we show that if one introduces alternating signs in the hoppings
along the hierarchy (instead of choosing all hoppings of the same sign), it is
possible to reach an Anderson localization critical point presenting
multifractal eigenfunctions and intermediate spectral statistics. The advantage
of this model is that one can write exact renormalization equations for some
observables. In particular, we obtain that the renormalized on-site energies
have the Cauchy distributions for exact fixed points. Another output of this
renormalization analysis is that the typical exponent of critical
eigenfunctions is always $\alpha_{typ}=2$, independently of the disorder
strength. We present numerical results concerning the whole multifractal
spectrum $f(\alpha)$ and the compressibility $\chi$ of the level statistics,
both for the box and the Cauchy distributions of the random on-site energies.

such that there are few with $L\gtrsim 10^{5}$Lsol, whilst the CHII regions are
detected up to ~10$^{6}Lsol. The lifetimes of these phases are also calculated
as a function of luminosity by comparison with the luminosity function for
local main-sequence OB stars. These indicate that the MYSO phase has a duration
ranging from 4x10$^{5}$ yrs for 10$^{4}$Lsol to ~7x10$^{4}$ yrs at

~3-10% of the exciting star's main-sequence lifetime. MYSOs between 10$^{4}
Lsol and ~10$^{5}$ Lsol are massive but do not display the radio continuum or
near-IR \HI{} recombination line emission indicative of an HII region,
consistent with being swollen due to high ongoing or recent accretion rates.
Above ~10$^{5}$ Lsol the MYSO phase lifetime becomes comparable to the
main-sequence Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, at which point the central star can
rapidly contract onto the main-sequence even if still accreting, and ionise a

photosphere is always challenging and problems arise because the inversion is
carried out through the numerical minimization of a merit function that depends
on the proposed model. We investigate the reliability of inversions in which
the stray-light contamination is obtained from the same observations as a local
average. In this case, we show that it is fundamental to include the covariance
between the observed Stokes profiles and the stray-light contamination. The
ensuing modified merit function of the inversion process penalizes large
stray-light contaminations simply because of the presence of positive
correlations between the observables and the stray-light, fundamentally
produced by spatially variable systematics. We caution that using the wrong
merit function, artificially large stray-light contaminations might be
inferred. Since this effect disappears if the stray-light contamination is
obtained as an average over the full field-of-view, we recommend to take into
account stray-light contamination using a global approach.

earliest, hottest evolution stage of the medium created in ultra-relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. Previous computations of photon emission have been
carried out using a hydrodynamical medium description with smooth, averaged
initial conditions. Recently, more sophisticated hydrodynamical models which
calculate observables by averaging over many evolutions with event-by-event
fluctuating initial conditions (IC) have been developed. Given their direct
connection to the early time dynamics, thermal photon emission appears an ideal
observable to probe fluctuations in the medium initial state. In this work, we
demonstrate that including fluctuations in the IC may lead to an enhancement of
the thermal photon yield of about a factor of 2 in the region $2 < p_T < 4$
GeV/$c$ (where thermal photon production dominates the direct photon yield)
compared to a scenario using smooth, averaged IC. Consequently, a much better
agreement with PHENIX data is found. This can be understood in terms of the
strong temperature dependence of thermal photon production, translating into a
sensitivity to the presence of 'hotspots' in an event and thus establishing
thermal photons as a suitable probe to characterize IC fluctuations.

Gamma=1.8, the measured column density is N_H=1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5} x 10^{24}

relations are derived by generalizing the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW)
relations to amplitudes in anti-de Sitter space (AdS) that are dual to boundary
correlators, and are usually computed perturbatively by Witten diagrams. Our
results relate vacuum-correlation functions to integrated products of
lower-point transition amplitudes, which correspond to correlators calculated
between states dual to certain normalizable modes. We show that the set of
polarization vectors for which amplitudes behave well under the BCFW extension
is smaller than in flat-space. We describe how transition amplitudes for more
general external polarizations can be constructed by combining answers obtained
by different pairs of BCFW shifts. We then generalize these recursion relations
to supersymmetric theories. In AdS, unlike flat-space, even maximal
supersymmetry is insufficient to permit the computation of all correlators of
operators in the same multiplet as a stress-tensor or conserved current.

observational data. The matter density at the present epoch $\Omega_m^0$ is
also taken to be a parameter in the analysis and its best-fit values are
obtained for each of the data sets. We found a strong dependence of dark energy
equation of state on the matter density in the present and earlier epoch. From
the analysis, we also predict the lower limit of matter density parameter at an
earlier epoch within 1$\sigma$ confidence level for a flat FRW universe. The
dark energy equation of state appears to be a slow varying function of $z$. The
variation of dark energy density parameter and the matter density parameter are
also shown along with their 1$\sigma$ variations.

discuss one of such predictions - existence of nonlocal correlations between
prequantum random fields corresponding to {\it all} quantum systems. (And by
PCSFT quantum systems are represented by classical Gaussian random fields and
quantum observables by quadratic forms of these fields.) The source of these
correlations is the common background field. Thus all prequantum random fields
are ""entangled"", but in the sense of classical signal theory. On one hand,
PCSFT demystifies quantum nonlocality by reducing it to nonlocal classical
correlations based on the common random background. On the other hand, it
demonstrates total generality of such correlations. They exist even for
distinguishable quantum systems in factorizable states (by PCSFT terminology -
for Gaussian random fields with covariance operators corresponding to
factorizable quantum states).

takes its inputs from a large population of stimulus-specific coding cells.
Adopting the diffusion-to-bound approach to model the decisional process, this
allows to relate analytically the bias and variance of the diffusion process
underlying decision making to macroscopic quantities that are behaviorally
measurable. A major consequence is the existence of a quantitative link between
reaction times and discrimination accuracy. The resulting analytical expression
of mean reaction times during an identification task accounts for empirical
facts, both qualitatively (e.g. more time is needed to identify a category from
a stimulus at the boundary compared to a stimulus lying within a category), and
quantitatively (working on published experimental data on phoneme
identification tasks).

mass of the companion. That low mass companions near or below the core
hydrogen-burning limit are able to trigger the ejection of this envelope is
well known. The currently known systems have very short periods
$\simeq0.1-0.3\,{\rm d}$. Here we report the discovery of a low mass companion
($M_{\rm 2}>0.14\,M_{\rm \odot}$) orbiting the sdB star and central star of a
planetary nebula EGB\,5 with an orbital period of $16.5\,{\rm d}$ at a minimum
separation of $23\,R_{\rm \odot}$. Its long period is only just consistent with
the energy balance prescription of the common envelope. The marked difference
between the short and long period systems will provide strong constraints on
the common envelope phase, in particular if the masses of the sdB stars can be
measured accurately. Due to selection effects, the fraction of sdBs with low
mass companions and similar or longer periods may be quite high. Low mass
stellar and substellar companions may therefore play a significant role for the
still unclear formation of hot subdwarf stars. Furthermore, the nebula around
EGB\,5 may be the remnant of the ejected common envelope making this binary a
unique system to study this short und poorly understood phase of binary

climate change on time scales of 50 to 1000 years. Evidence for this
understanding is that the terrestrial climate correlates positively with solar
activity. During the past 10,000 years, the Sun has experienced substantial
variations in activity and there have been numerous attempts to reconstruct
solar irradiance. While there is general agreement on how solar forcing varied
during the last several hundred years --- all reconstructions are proportional
to the solar activity --- there is scientific controversy on the magnitude of
solar forcing. We present a reconstruction of the Total and Spectral Solar
Irradiance covering 130 nm--10 $\mu$m from 1610 to the present with annual
resolution and for the Holocene with 22-year resolution. We assume that the
minimum state of the quiet Sun in time corresponds to the observed quietest
area on the present Sun. Then we use available long-term proxies of the solar
activity, which are $^{10}$Be isotope concentrations in ice cores and 22-year
smoothed neutron monitor data, to interpolate between the present quiet Sun and
the minimum state of the quiet Sun. This determines the long-term trend in the
solar variability which is then superposed with the 11-year activity cycle
calculated from the sunspot number. The time-dependent solar spectral
irradiance from about 7000 BC to the present is then derived using a
state-of-the-art radiation code. We derive a total and spectral solar
irradiance that was substantially lower during the Maunder minimum than
observed today. The difference is remarkably larger than other estimations
published in the recent literature. The magnitude of the solar UV variability,
which indirectly affects climate is also found to exceed previous estimates. We
discuss in details the assumptions which leaded us to this conclusion.

databases, for example those used in Data Integration Systems. Such morphisms
in this DB category are not functions but have the complex tree structures
based on a set of complex query computations between two database-instances.
Thus DB category, as a base category for the semantics of databases and
mappings between them, is different from the Set category used dominantly for
such issues, and needs the full investigation of its properties. In this paper
we presented another contributions for an intensive exploration of properties
and semantics of this category, based on the power-view monad T and the Kleisli
category for databases. Here we stressed some Universal algebra considerations
based on monads and relationships between this DB category and the standard Set
category. Finally, we investigated the general algebraic and induction
properties for databases in this category, and we defined the initial monadic
algebras for database instances.

represents one of the critical factors of the telecommunication technologies,
both to allow a sizeable saving of economic resources and to realize
""sustainable"" development actions. The consumption of about one hundred base
stations for mobile phones were monitored for a total of over one thousand
days, in order to study the energy consumption in relation to the
environmental, electric and logistics parameters of the stations themselves. It
was possible to survey, then, the role of the mobile communication systems in
the general national energy framework and to plot the best areas of
intervention for saving energy and improving the environmental impact, showing
the role played by air conditioning and transmission equipments. Finally, new
transmission algorithms and the use of renewable energy based techniques have
been tested.
