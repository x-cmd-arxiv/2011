corrections for arbitrary stellar parameter combinations and line strengths.
The typical corrections for weak lines are -0.1...-0.2dex, whereas saturated

investigate the in-plane strain effects on both the magnetic configuration and
the polarization by means of density functional theory calculations and model
Hamiltonian approaches. Our results show that the net polarization is largely
enhanced under compressive strain, due to an increase of the electronic
contribution to the polarization, whereas the ionic contribution is found to
decrease. We identify the electron-lattice coupling, due to Jahn-Teller (JT)
distortions, and its response to strain to be responsible for the observed
behavior. The JT-induced orbital ordering of occupied Mn-e$_g^1$ electrons in
alternating $3x^2-r^2/3y^2-r^2$ orbital states at equilibrium changes to a
mixture with $x^2-z^2/y^2-z^2$ states under in-plane compressive strain. The
asymmetric hopping of e$_g$ electrons between Mn ions along zig-zag spin chains
(typical of the AFM-E spin configuration) is therefore enhanced under strain,
explaining the large value of the polarization. We reproduce the change in the
orbital ordering pattern in a degenerate double-exchange model supplemented
with electron-phonon interaction. In this picture, the orbital ordering change
is related to a change of the Berry phase of the e$_g$ electrons, which in turn
causes an increase of the polarization, whose origin is purely electronic.

shown to lead to a geometricized theory of electrodynamics. While this
geometricized theory leads directly to the classical Maxwell equations, it also
extends their interpretation by giving charge density and mass density, and the
four-velocity that describes their motion geometric definitions. These
geometric definitions are reminiscent of General Relativity's interpretation of
mass in terms of the scalar curvature R and hint at the emergence of gravity.
The gravitational theory that does emerge is shown to be equivalent to
Einstein's General Relativity augmented by an energy-momentum tensor term that
mimics the properties of dark matter and/or dark energy. In summary, the
proposed geometrization of the Maxwell tensor puts both electromagnetic and
gravitational phenomena on an equal footing with both being tied to the
curvature of space-time. Using specific solutions to the proposed theory, the
unification brought to electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena, as well as
the relationship of those solutions to the corresponding solutions of the

imaging obtained with the CFHT archive Megaprime/Megacam camera in the g' and
r' bands, covering a total region of about 1.05 x 1.16 deg^2. Our X-ray
analysis is based on archive XMM-Newton images. Numerical simulations were
performed using an N-body algorithm to treat the dark matter component, a
semi-analytical galaxy formation model for the evolution of the galaxies and a
grid-based hydrodynamic code with a PPM scheme for the dynamics of the
intra-cluster medium. We have computed galaxy luminosity functions (GLFs) and
2D temperature and metallicity maps of the X-ray gas, which we then compared to
the results of our numerical simulations. The GLFs of Abell 1758 North are well
fit by Schechter functions in the g' and r' bands, but a small excess of bright
galaxies, particularly in the r' band. On the contrary, the GLFs of Abell 1758
South are not well fit by Schechter functions: excesses of bright galaxies are
seen in both bands. Comparing observational results to those derived from
numerical simulations, we could mimic the most prominent features present in
the metallicity map and propose an explanation for the dynamical history of the
cluster. Particilarly, we found in particular that in the metal rich elongated
regions of the North cluster, winds had been more efficient in transporting
metal enriched gas to the outskirts than ram pressure stripping. We confirm the
merging structure of each of the North and South clusters, both at optical and

the technology of the cognitive radio network (CRN). Most of the current works
dealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the
problem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or
spectrum mobility. In this work, we argue that for certain network
configurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management
improves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, we study the uplink resource
management problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs)
and access points (APs), with each AP operates on a set of non-overlapping
channels. The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have
to associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels
belong to this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly
interdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently
and distributedly is still open in the literature.
  In this work we formulate this joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing
problem into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy of a player
contains a discrete variable and a continuous vector. The structure of the game
is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game
proposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium
(NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to
distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels
with other CUs. Finally, we study the properties of the proposed algorithms as
well as their performance via extensive simulations.

microwave-band satellite recently proposed to ESA within Cosmic Vision
2015-2025. COrE will provide maps of the microwave sky in polarization and
temperature in 15 frequency bands, ranging from 45 GHz to 795 GHz, with an
angular resolution ranging from 23 arcmin (45 GHz) and 1.3 arcmin (795 GHz) and
sensitivities roughly 10 to 30 times better than PLANCK (depending on the
frequency channel). The COrE mission will lead to breakthrough science in a
wide range of areas, ranging from primordial cosmology to galactic and
extragalactic science. COrE is designed to detect the primordial gravitational
waves generated during the epoch of cosmic inflation at more than $3\sigma $
for $r=(T/S)>=10^{-3}$. It will also measure the CMB gravitational lensing
deflection power spectrum to the cosmic variance limit on all linear scales,
allowing us to probe absolute neutrino masses better than laboratory
experiments and down to plausible values suggested by the neutrino oscillation
data. COrE will also search for primordial non-Gaussianity with significant
improvements over Planck in its ability to constrain the shape (and amplitude)
of non-Gaussianity. In the areas of galactic and extragalactic science, in its
highest frequency channels COrE will provide maps of the galactic polarized
dust emission allowing us to map the galactic magnetic field in areas of
diffuse emission not otherwise accessible to probe the initial conditions for
star formation. COrE will also map the galactic synchrotron emission thirty
times better than PLANCK. This White Paper reviews the COrE science program,
our simulations on foreground subtraction, and the proposed instrumental
configuration.

synthesis is driven by a proton motive force (PMF) comprising a proton

that proton-driven subunit rotation within FoF1-ATP synthase is associated with
ATP synthesis. Based on intramolecular distance measurements by single-molecule

and the step sizes of the different rotor parts have been unraveled. However,
these experiments were accomplished in the presence of a PMF consisting of a
maximum {\Delta}pH ~ 4 and an unknown {\Delta}{\Psi}. In contrast, in living
bacteria the maximum {\Delta}pH across the plasma membrane is likely 0.75, and
{\Delta}{\Psi} has been measured between -80 and -140 mV. Thus the problem of
in vivo catalytic turnover rates, or the in vivo rotational speed in single

these variations and create a spot map of the stellar surface of CoRoT-2 within

This rotation period is shorter than the 4.54 days as derived from the
out-of-transit light modulation. Since the transit data samples a region close

reflects the average rotation of the star, this is taken as an indication of a
latitudinal differential rotation of about 3% or 0.042 rad/d.

in an artificial world in which Nc, the number of colors, is large and the
quarks of all species are degenerate and much larger than {\Lambda}_QCD. It has
long been known that in large Nc QCD, baryons composed entirely of heavy quarks
are accurately described in the mean-field approximation. However, the detailed
properties of baryons in the combined large Nc and heavy quark limits have not
been fully explored. Here some basic properties of baryons are computed using a
variational approach. At leading order in both the large Nc and heavy quark
expansions the baryon mass is computed explicitly as is the baryon form factor.
Baryonic matter, the analog of nuclear matter in this artificial world, should
also be well described in the mean-field approximation. In the special case
where all baryons have an identical spin flavor structure, it is shown that in
the formal heavy quark and large Nc limit interactions between baryons are
strictly repulsive at low densities. The energy per baryon is computed in this
limit and found to be exponentially small. It is shown that when the
restriction to baryons with an identical spin-flavor structure is dropped, a
phase of baryonic matter exists with a density of 2Nf times that for the

can be shown to outperform the measurement-based quantum feedback scheme that
can only generate pseudo-nonlinear quantum effects. Such advancement is
demonstrated by two application examples in quantum optics on chip. In the
first example, we show that the nonlinear Kerr effect can be generated and
amplified to be comparable with the linear effect in a transmission line

quantum amplifiers in a TLR coherent feedback network, non-Gaussian ""light""

periodicity conditions with arbitrary phases are considered along the compact

vacuum energy density are negative, with independence of the phases in the
periodicity conditions and of the value of the gauge potential. Interaction
forces between the plates are thus always attractive. However, in physical
situations where the quantum field is confined to the region between the
plates, the pure topological part contributes as well, and then the resulting
force can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the specific phases
encoded in the periodicity conditions along the compact dimensions, and on the
gauge potential, too. Applications of the general formulas to cylindrical
carbon nanotubes are considered, within the framework of a Dirac-like theory
for the electronic states in graphene. In the absence of a magnetic flux, the
energy density for semiconducting nanotubes is always negative. For metallic
nanotubes the energy density is positive for long tubes and negative for short
ones. The resulting Casimir forces acting on the edges of the nanotube are
attractive for short tubes with independence of the tube chirality. The sign of
the force for long nanotubes can be controlled by tuning the magnetic flux.

best explained by the high electron density and strong magnetic field of the GC

absolute RM values are indirect measures of the GC magnetic field, the RM
longitude structure directly traces the magnetic field in the central

larger RM structure covering the central ~2 degrees of the Galaxy. This RM

the Universe undergoes a transition between a non-singular pre-inflationary,
radiation-dominated phase and a slow-roll inflationary evolution. The
ultraviolet divergences are eliminated via adiabatic subtraction. A consistent
regularization of the field fluctuations through this transition is obtained by
performing a mode matching for both the gauge invariant Mukhanov variable and
its adiabatic expansion. We show that these quantities do not generate
ultraviolet divergences other than the standard ones, when evolving through the
matching time. We also show how the de Witt-Schwinger expansion, which can be
used to construct the counter-terms regularizing the ultraviolet divergences,
ceases to be valid well before horizon exit of the scales of interest. Thus,
such counter-terms should not be used beyond the time of the horizon exit so it
is unlikely that the observed power spectrum is modified by adiabatic
subtraction as claimed in the literature. However, the infrared regularization
might have an impact on the observed spectrum, and we briefly discuss this
possibility.

separated from their mutual 2:1 mean-motion resonance. Neptune and Uranus are
decoupled from each other and have orbital eccentricities damped to near their
current values. From this point we adopt a planet migration model in which the
migration speed decreases exponentially with a characteristic timescale tau
(the e-folding time). We perform a series of numerical simulations, each
involving the migrating giant planets plus test particle Trojans and
quasi-satellites. We find that the libration frequencies of Trojans are similar
to those of quasi-satellites. This similarity enables a dynamical exchange of
objects back and forth between the Trojan and quasi-satellite resonances during
planetary migration. Furthermore, under the influence of these secondary
resonances quasi-satellites can have their libration amplitudes enlarged until
they undergo a close-encounter with their host planet and escape from the
resonance. High-resolution simulations of this escape process reveal that ~80%
of Jovian quasi-satellites experience one or more close-encounters within
Jupiter's Hill radius (R_H) as they are forced out of the quasi-satellite
resonance. As many as ~20% come within R_H/4 and ~2.5% come within R_H/10.
Close-encounters of escaping quasi-satellites occur near or even below the

channel matrix allowing for symbol insertions and deletions in addition to
random errors are considered. Such channels are information stable, hence their
Shannon capacity exists. However, computation of the channel capacity is
formidable, and only some upper and lower bounds on the capacity (for some
special cases) exist. In this short paper, using a simple methodology, we prove
that the channel capacity is a convex function of the stochastic channel
matrix. Since the more widely studied model of an independent identically
distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel is a particular case, as an immediate
corollary to this result we also argue that the i.i.d. deletion channel
capacity is a convex function of the deletion probability. We further use this
result to improve the existing capacity upper bounds on the deletion channel by
a proper ""convexification"" argument. In particular, we prove that the capacity
of the deletion channel, as the deletion probability d --> 1, is upper bounded

entanglement spectrum of the reduced density matrix of ground-states of
time-reversal breaking topological phases (fractional quantum Hall states)
contains information about the counting of their edge modes when the
ground-state is cut in two spatially distinct regions and one of the regions is
traced out. We analytically substantiate this conjecture for a series of FQH
states defined as unique zero modes of pseudopotential Hamiltonians by finding
a one to one map between the thermodynamic limit counting of two different
entanglement spectra: the particle entanglement spectrum, whose counting of
eigenvalues for each good quantum number is identical (up to accidental
degeneracies) to the counting of bulk quasiholes, and the orbital entanglement
spectrum (the Li-Haldane spectrum). As the particle entanglement spectrum is
related to bulk quasihole physics and the orbital entanglement spectrum is
related to edge physics, our map can be thought of as a mathematically sound
microscopic description of bulk-edge correspondence in entanglement spectra. By
using a set of clustering operators which have their origin in conformal field
theory (CFT) operator expansions, we show that the counting of the orbital
entanglement spectrum eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit must be identical
to the counting of quasiholes in the bulk. The latter equals the counting of
edge modes at a hard-wall boundary placed on the sample. Moreover, we show this
to be true even for CFT states which are likely bulk gapless, such as the
Gaffnian wavefunction.

The generalized Hamiltonian contains two types of interaction freedoms: One set
of functions that appears in the Q-structure of the generalized curvatures of

in typical two dimensional doped Mott insulators, namely, underdoped cuprate
superconductors. To develop a physically unequivocal theory, we start from the
slave-boson mean-field theory for the Hubbard model on a square lattice. Our
crucial step is to further take into account the charge dynamics and
fluctuations. The extra charge fluctuations seriously modify low-energy
single-particle spectra of doped Mott insulators near the Fermi level: An
electron added around an empty site (or a hole added around a doubly occupied
site) constitutes composite fermion (cofermion), called holo-electron (or
doublo-hole) at low energy in distinction from the normal quasiparticles. These
unexplored composite fermions substantiate the extra charge fluctuation. We
show that the quasiparticles hybridize with the holo-electrons and
doublo-holes. The resultant hybridization gap is identified as the pseudogap
observed in the underdoped region of the high-T_c cuprates. Because the Fermi
level crosses the top (bottom) of the low-energy band formed just below (above)
the hybridization gap in the hole-doped (electron-doped) case, it causes a
Fermi-surface reconstruction, namely, a topological change in the Fermi surface
forced by the penetration of zeros of the quasiparticle Green function. This
reconstruction signals the emergence of a non-Fermi-liquid phase. The
pseudogap, and the resultant formation of pocket or arc of the Fermi surface
reproduce the experimental results for the cuprate superconductors in the
underdoped region. The pairing channel opens not only between two
quasiparticles but also between a quasiparticle and a cofermion. This pairing
solves the puzzle of the dichotomy between the d-wave superconductivity and the
precursors of the the insulating gap in the antinodal region.

jets around black holes to derive the cosmic spin history of the most massive
black holes, with masses >~10^8 Msol. Assuming the jet efficiency depends on
spin a, we can approximately reproduce the observed `radio loudness' of quasars
and the local radio luminosity function. Using the X-ray luminosity function
and the local mass function of supermassive black holes, SMBHs we can reproduce
the individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and
low-excitation narrow emission lines. The data favour spin distributions that
are bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximal
spin. In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar
amplitudes. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin
peak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak. A bimodality
should be seen in the radio loudness of quasars. We predict that the
low-excitation galaxies are dominated by SMBHs with masses >~10^8 Msol, down to
radio luminosity densities ~10^21 W Hz-1 sr-1 at 1.4~GHz. Our model is also
able to predict the radio luminosity function at z=1, and predicts it to be
dominated by high-excitation galaxies above luminosity densities >~10^26 W Hz-1
sr-1, in full agreement with the observations. From our parametrisation and
using the best fitting jet efficiencies there is marginal evidence for
evolution in spin: the mean spin increases slightly from <a>~0.25 at z=1 to
<a>~0.35 at z=0, and the fraction of SMBHs with a>=0.5 increases from
0.16+-0.03 at z=1 to 0.24+-0.09 at z=0. Our results are in excellent agreement
with the mean radiative efficiency of quasars, as well as recent cosmological
simulations. We discuss the implications in terms of accretion and SMBH

enrich the circumnuclear gas with re-processed material? Is there any

~ 5-25%. A ROSAT X-ray image displays an elongated ICM and the large-scale
distribution of galaxies reveals two cluster cores, all pointing towards a
binary cluster merger event. The radio relics are located symmetrically with
respect to the X-ray center of the cluster, along the proposed merger axis. The
relics have a linear extent of 1.4 Mpc and 290 kpc. This factor of five
difference in linear size is unlike that of previously known double relic
systems, for which the sizes do not differ by more than a factor of two. We
conclude that the double relics in ZwCl 0008.8+5215 are best explained by two
outward moving shock waves in which particles are (re)accelerated trough the
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. [abridged]

propose a thresholding procedure which is adaptive to the variability of
individual entries. The estimators are fully data driven and enjoy excellent

adaptively achieve the optimal rate of convergence over a large class of sparse
covariance matrices under the spectral norm. In contrast, the commonly used
universal thresholding estimators are shown to be sub-optimal over the same
parameter spaces. Support recovery is also discussed. The adaptive thresholding
estimators are easy to implement. Numerical performance of the estimators is
studied using both simulated and real data. Simulation results show that the
adaptive thresholding estimators uniformly outperform the universal
thresholding estimators. The method is also illustrated in an analysis on a

lag cross-correlations in multiple time series. We apply the method to 48 world
indices, one for each of 48 different countries. We find long-range power-law
cross-correlations in the absolute values of returns that quantify risk, and
find that they decay much more slowly than cross-correlations between the
returns. The magnitude of the cross-correlations constitute ""bad news"" for
international investment managers who may believe that risk is reduced by
diversifying across countries. We find that when a market shock is transmitted
around the world, the risk decays very slowly. We explain these time lag
cross-correlations by introducing a global factor model (GFM) in which all
index returns fluctuate in response to a single global factor. For each pair of
individual time series of returns, the cross-correlations between returns (or
magnitudes) can be modeled with the auto-correlations of the global factor
returns (or magnitudes). We estimate the global factor using principal
component analysis, which minimizes the variance of the residuals after
removing the global trend. Using random matrix theory, a significant fraction
of the world index cross-correlations can be explained by the global factor,
which supports the utility of the GFM. We demonstrate applications of the GFM
in forecasting risks at the world level, and in finding uncorrelated individual
indices. We find 10 indices are practically uncorrelated with the global factor
and with the remainder of the world indices, which is relevant information for
world managers in reducing their portfolio risk. Finally, we argue that this
general method can be applied to a wide range of phenomena in which time series
are measured, ranging from seismology and physiology to atmospheric geophysics.

proximity has permitted a detailed SMA study of the circumnuclear molecular gas
in a galaxy exhibiting an AGN. Based on an analysis of the high-resolution
velocity field of the central region (20"" X 20"", 1"" = 19 pc), we demonstrate
that the S-shaped structure of the isovelocity contours is well reproduced by
the numerical results of a two dimensional hydrodynamical simulation. In
particular, the velocity structure is represented by the bending produced by a
shock along the spiral density waves, which are excited at the outer-inner
Lindblad resonance by a fast rotating bar. The simulated density map reveals a
pair of tightly wound spirals in the center which pass through most of the
ring-like (claimed to be a circumnuclear starburst ring by other authors) high
intensity region in the observations as well as intersect several Pa$\alpha$
emission line knots located outside the ring-like region. The calculated mass
inflow rate at a scale of 50 pc is about three times the inferred mass
accretion rate of the AGN of NGC 4945. We find that self-gravity of the gas is
important and should be included in our model for NGC 4945. The model is
compared with the gas orbit model discussed in Lim et al. (2009), and it is
shown that the hydrodynamic model provides a better match to the observed

using telescope images. Conventional centroid estimation fits a template point
spread function (PSF) to the image data. Because the PSF is typically not known
to high accuracy due to wavefront aberrations and uncertainties in optical
system, a simple Gaussian function is commonly used. PSF knowledge error leads
to systematic errors in the conventional centroid estimation. In this paper, we
present an accurate centroid estimation algorithm by reconstructing the PSF
from well sampled (above Nyquist frequency) pixelated images. In the limit of
an ideal focal plane array whose pixels have identical response function (no
inter-pixel variation), this method can estimate centroid displacement between
two 32$\times$32 images to sub-micropixel accuracy. Inter-pixel response
variations exist in real detectors, {\it e.g.}~CCDs, which we can calibrate by
measuring the pixel response of each pixel in Fourier space. The Fourier
transforms of the inter-pixel variations of pixel response functions can be
conveniently expressed in terms of powers of spatial wave numbers using their
Taylor series expansions. Calibrating up to the third order terms in this
expansion, we show that our centroid displacement estimation is accurate to a
few micro-pixels using simulated data. This algorithm is applicable to the new
proposed mission concept Nearest Earth Astrometry Telescope (NEAT) to achieve
mirco-arcsecond accuracy in relative astrometry for detecting terrestrial
exoplanets. This technology is also applicable to high precision photometry
missions.

emission lines in the stellar-continuum-subtracted spectra from which local
metallicities are computed. For the supernova regions we estimate both the mean
stellar age, interpreting the stellar absorption with population synthesis
models, and the age of the youngest stellar populations using the H-alpha
equivalent width as an age indicator. These estimates are compared with the
lifetimes of single massive stars. Results: Based on our sample, we detect a
tentative indication that Type Ic supernovae might explode in environments that
are more metal-rich than those of Type Ib supernovae (average difference of
0.08 dex), but this is not a statistically significant result. The lower limits
placed on the ages of the supernova birthplaces are overall young, although
there are several cases where these appear older than what is expected for the
evolution of single stars more massive than 25-30 M_{sun}. This is only true,
however, assuming that the supernova progenitors were born during an
instantaneous (not continuous) episode of star formation. Conclusions: These
results do not conclusively favor any of the two evolutionary paths (single or
binary) leading to stripped supernovae. We do note a fraction of events for
which binary evolution is more likely, due to their associated age limits. The
fact, however, that the supernova environments contain areas of recent (< 15
Myr) star formation and that the environmental metallicities are, at least, not
against the single evolutionary scenario, suggest that this channel is also
broadly consistent with the observations.

return arbitrarily poor results, if even a single column is corrupted. One
direct application comes from robust collaborative filtering. Here, some number
of users are so-called manipulators who try to skew the predictions of the
algorithm by calibrating their inputs to the system. In this paper, we develop
an efficient algorithm for this problem based on a combination of a trimming
procedure and a convex program that minimizes the nuclear norm and the
$\ell_{1,2}$ norm. Our theoretical results show that given a vanishing fraction
of observed entries, it is nevertheless possible to complete the underlying
matrix even when the number of corrupted columns grows. Significantly, our
results hold without any assumptions on the locations or values of the observed
entries of the manipulated columns. Moreover, we show by an
information-theoretic argument that our guarantees are nearly optimal in terms
of the fraction of sampled entries on the authentic columns, the fraction of
corrupted columns, and the rank of the underlying matrix. Our results therefore

induction equation (GLIE), which replaces the commonly used local induction
approximation (LIA) to simulate the dynamics of vortex lines and thus
superfluid turbulence. We show that the LIA is, without in fact any
approximation at all, a general feature of the velocity field induced by any
length of a curved vortex filament. Specifically, the LIA states that the
velocity field induced by a curved vortex filament is asymmetric in the
binormal direction. Up to a potential term, the induced incompressible field is
given by the Biot-Savart integral, where we recall that there is a direct
analogy between hydrodynamics and magnetostatics. Series approximations to the
Biot-Savart integrand indicate a logarithmic divergence of the local field in
the binormal direction. While this is qualitatively correct, LIA lacks metrics
quantifying its small parameters. Regardless, LIA is used in vortex filament
methods simulating the self-induced motion of quantized vortices. With numerics
in mind, we represent the binormal field in terms of incomplete elliptic
integrals, which is valid for $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. From this and known expansions
we derive the GLIE, asymptotic for local field points. Like the LIA,
generalized induction shows a persistent binormal deviation in the local-field
but unlike the LIA, the GLIE provides bounds on the truncated remainder. As an
application, we adapt formulae from vortex filament methods to the GLIE for
future use in these methods. Other examples we consider include vortex rings,
relevant for both superfluid $^4$He and Bose-Einstein condensates.

two Co/Pd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) using
polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR). PNR was measured in an external magnetic
field H applied in the plane of the sample with the magnetization M confined in
the plane for {\mu}_o H= 6.0 T and partially out of plane at 0.65 T. Nominal
thicknesses of the Co and Pd layers were 2.5 {\AA} and 21 {\AA}, respectively.
Because of these small values, the actual layer chemical composition,
thickness, and interface roughness parameters were determined from the nuclear
scattering length density profile ({\rho}_n) and its derivative obtained from
both x-ray reflectivity and PNR, and uncertainties were determined using Monte
Carlo analysis. The PNR {\rho}_n showed that although D2 absorption occurred
throughout the samples, absorption in the multilayer stack was modest (0.02 D
per Pd atom) and thus did not expand. Direct magnetometry showed that H2
absorption decreased the total M at saturation and increased the component of M
in the plane of the sample when not at saturation. The PNR magnetic scattering
length density ({\rho}_m) revealed that the Pd layers in the multilayer stack
were magnetized and that their magnetization was preferentially modified upon
D2 absorption. In one sample, a modulation of M with twice the multilayer
period was observed at {\mu}_o H= 0.65 T, which increased upon D2 absorption.
These results indicate that H2 or D2 absorption decreases both the PMA and
total magnetization of the samples. The lack of measurable expansion during
absorption indicates that these changes are primarily governed by modification
of the electronic structure of the material.

which both HST/ACS and NICMOS high-resolution imaging and VLT VIMOS IFU
spectroscopy are available. Based on this data set, we analyze the inner
regions of the galaxies, i.e. typically within one (3D) effective radius r_e,
under the assumption of axial symmetry and by constructing dynamical models
supported by two-integral stellar DFs. For all systems, the total mass density
distribution is found to be well approximated by a simple power-law: this
profile is on average slightly super-isothermal, with a logarithmic slope
<gamma'> = 2.074^{+0.043}_{-0.041} (68% CL) and an intrinsic scatter
0.144^{+0.055}_{-0.014}, and is fairly round, with an average axial ratio <q> =
0.77+/-0.04. The lower limit for the dark matter fraction (fDM) inside r_e
ranges, in individual systems, from nearly zero to almost a half, with a median
value of 12%. By including stellar masses derived from SPS models with a
Salpeter IMF, we obtain an average fDM = 31%. The fDM rises to 61% if, instead,
a Chabrier IMF is assumed. For both IMFs, the dark matter fraction increases
with the total mass of the galaxy (3-sigma correlation). Based on the intrinsic
angular momentum parameter calculated from our models, we find that the
galaxies can be divided into two dynamically distinct groups, which are shown
to correspond to the usual classes of the slow and fast rotators. Overall, the
SLACS systems are structurally and dynamically very similar to their nearby
counterparts, indicating that the inner regions of early-type galaxies have
undergone little, if any, evolution since redshift z ~ 0.35. (Abridged)

Saarbruecken, Germany, on April 2nd, 2011, as part of the fourteenth edition of
the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2011).
Research in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to
practical issues. Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common
subexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of
computations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research
areas, for instance : the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting
by (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical
abstract machines, the implementation techniques of programming languages. Term
graphs are also used in automated theorem proving and symbolic computation
systems working on shared structures. The aim of this workshop is to bring
together researchers working in different domains on term and graph
transformation and to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for
presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn
about current activities in term graph rewriting. These proceedings contain six
accepted papers and the abstracts of three invited talks. All submissions were
subject to careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers range over a wide
spectrum, including theoretical aspects of term graph rewriting, proof methods,
semantics as well as application issues of term graph transformation.

construct real ""Vassiliev-type"" cohomology classes in spaces of knots in
higher-dimensional Euclidean space. By doing this integration via a
Pontrjagin-Thom construction, we constructed cohomology classes in the knot

conjecture that we can produce all Vassiliev-type classes in this manner. Here

observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. The observations
used the Parkes multibeam receiver with a central frequency of 1369 MHz and the
Parkes digital filterbank pulsar signal-processing system PDFB2. Because of the
large total observing time, the summed polarization profiles have very high
signal/noise ratios and show many previously undetected profile features.
Thirteen of the 20 pulsars show emission over more than half of the pulse
period. Polarization variations across the profiles are complex and the
observed position angle variations are generally not in accord with the
rotating-vector model for pulsar polarization. Never-the-less, the polarization
properties are broadly similar to those of normal (non-millisecond) pulsars,
suggesting that the basic radio emission mechanism is the same in both classes
of pulsar. The results support the idea that radio emission from millisecond
pulsars originates high in the pulsar magnetosphere, probably close to the
emission regions for high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray emission. Rotation
measures were obtained for all 20 pulsars, eight of which had no previously
published measurements.

  2009","STOC 2009",,,"cs.GT stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  If a game has a Nash equilibrium with probability values that are either zero
or Omega(1) then this equilibrium can be found exhaustively in polynomial time.
Somewhat surprisingly, we show that there is a PTAS for the games whose
equilibria are guaranteed to have small-O(1/n)-values, and therefore
large-Omega(n)-supports. We also point out that there is a PTAS for games with
sparse payoff matrices, which are known to be PPAD-complete to solve exactly.
Both algorithms are of a special kind that we call oblivious: The algorithm
just samples a fixed distribution on pairs of mixed strategies, and the game is
only used to determine whether the sampled strategies comprise an eps-Nash
equilibrium; the answer is yes with inverse polynomial probability. These
results bring about the question: Is there an oblivious PTAS for Nash
equilibrium in general games? We answer this question in the negative; our
lower bound comes close to the quasi-polynomial upper bound of [Lipton,
Markakis, Mehta 2003].
  Another recent PTAS for anonymous games is also oblivious in a weaker sense
appropriate for this class of games (it samples from a fixed distribution on
unordered collections of mixed strategies), but its runtime is exponential in
1/eps. We prove that any oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with two strategies
and three player types must have 1/eps^c in the exponent of the running time
for some c>1/3, rendering the algorithm in [Daskalakis 2008] essentially
optimal within oblivious algorithms. In contrast, we devise a poly(n)
(1/eps)^O(log^2(1/eps)) non-oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with 2
strategies and any bounded number of player types.
  Our algorithm is based on the construction of a sparse (and efficiently
computable) eps-cover of the set of all possible sums of n independent
indicators, under the total variation distance. The size of the cover is
poly(n) (1/ eps^{O(log^2 (1/eps))}.

exploit the resources produced by its own species and by the other species, we
carry out a comparative study of an interacting particle system and its
mean-field approximation. For a wide range of parameter values, we show both
analytically and numerically that the spatial model results in predictions that
significantly differ from its nonspatial counterpart, indicating that the use
of the mean-field approach to describe the evolution of communities in which
individuals only interact locally is invalid. In two-species communities, the
disagreements between the models appear either when both species compete by
producing resources that are more beneficial for their own species or when both
species cooperate by producing resources that are more beneficial for the other
species. In particular, while both species coexist if and only if they
cooperate in the mean-field approximation, the inclusion of space in the form
of local interactions may prevent coexistence even in cooperative communities.
Introducing additional species, cooperation is no longer the only mechanism
that promotes coexistence. We prove that, in three-species communities,
coexistence results either from a global cooperative behavior, or from
rock-paper-scissors type interactions, or from a mixture of these dynamics,
which excludes in particular all cases in which two species compete.

precisely under which conditions scale invariance implies invariance under the
full conformal group. While the general answer in two dimensions has been known
for over twenty years, a precise non-perturbative relation between scale and
conformal invariance in higher dimensions has been lacking. In this note, we
specialize to four dimensions and give a full quantum mechanical proof that
certain unitary R-symmetric fixed points are necessarily superconformal. Among
other consequences, this result implies that the infrared fixed points of N=1
supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics are superconformal.

coefficients of a Maass-Hecke newform at cusps other than infinity to be
multiplicative. To be precise, the Fourier coefficients are defined using a
choice of matrix in SL(2, Z) which maps infinity to the cusp in question. Let c
and d be the entries in the bottom row of this matrix, and let N be the level.
In earlier work with Dorian Goldfeld and Min Lee, we proved that the
coefficients will be multiplicative whenever N divides 2cd. This paper proves
that they will not be multiplicative unless N divides 576cd. Further, if one
assumes that the Hecke eigenvalue vanishes less than half the time then this

multichannel deconvolution model with a boxcar-like kernel which is of
particular interest in signal processing. It is known that, when the number of
channels is finite, the precision of reconstruction of the response function
increases as the number of channels $M$ grow (even when the total number of
observations $n$ for all channels $M$ remains constant) and this requires that
the parameter of the channels form a Badly Approximable $M$-tuple.
  Recent advances in data collection and recording techniques made it of urgent
interest to study the case when the number of channels $M=M_n$ grow with the
total number of observations $n$. However, in real-life situations, the number
of channels $M = M_n$ usually refers to the number of physical devices and,
consequently, may grow to infinity only at a slow rate as $n \rightarrow
\infty$. When $M=M_n$ grows slowly as $n$ increases, we develop a procedure for
the construction of a Badly Approximable $M$-tuple on a specified interval, of
a non-asymptotic length, together with a lower bound associated with this
$M$-tuple, which explicitly shows its dependence on $M$ as $M$ is growing. This
result is further used for the evaluation of the $L^2$-risk of the suggested
adaptive wavelet thresholding estimator of the unknown response function and,
furthermore, for the choice of the optimal number of channels $M$ which
minimizes the $L^2$-risk.

luminosity range from below to above the luminosity of the clump. Fifteen new
Li-rich giants including four super Li-rich K giants (A(Li) >= 3.2) were
discovered. A significant finding is that there is a concentration of Li-rich K
giants at the luminosity of the clump or red horizontal branch. This new
finding is partly a consequence of the fact that our low-resolution survey is
the first large survey to include giants well below and above the RGB bump and
clump locations in the HR diagram. Origin of the lithium enrichment may be
plausibly attributed to the conversion of 3He via 7Be to 7Li by the
Cameron-Fowler mechanism but the location for onset of the conversion is
uncertain. Two possible opportunities to effect this conversion are discussed:
the bump in the first ascent of the red giant branch (RGB) and the He-core
flash at the tip of the RGB. The finite luminosity spread of the Li-rich giants
serves to reject the idea that Li enhancement is, in general, a consequence of
a giant swallowing a large planet.

heavily on semidefinite programming (SDP). Given a highly satisfiable instance
of Unique Games, our algorithm is able to recover a good assignment. The
approximation guarantee depends only on the completeness of the game, and not
on the alphabet size, while the running time depends on spectral properties of
the {\em Label-Extended} graph associated with the instance of Unique Games.
  We further show that on input the integrality gap instance of Khot and
Vishnoi, our algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and decides that the
instance if highly unsatisfiable. Notably, when run on this instance, the
standard SDP relaxation of Unique Games {\em fails}. As a special case, we also
re-derive a polynomial time algorithm for Unique Games on expander constraint
graphs.
  The main ingredient of our algorithm is a technique to effectively use the
full spectrum of the underlying graph instead of just the second eigenvalue,
which is of independent interest. The question of how to take advantage of the
full spectrum of a graph in the design of algorithms has been often studied,

effects and temperature dependence of specific heat have been investigated to
understand the magnetic behavior of these particles. We find that the system
shows some features characteristic of nanoparticle magnetism such as
bifurcation of field cooled (FC) and zero field cooled (ZFC) susceptibilities
and a slow relaxation of magnetization. However, strangely, the temperature at
which the ZFC magnetization peaks coincides with the bifurcation temperature
and does not shift on application of magnetic fields up to 1 kOe, unlike most
other nanoparticle systems. Aging effects in these particles are negligible in
both FC and ZFC protocol and memory effects are present only in FC protocol. We
estimate the N\'eel temperature by using Fisher's relation as well as directly
by measurement of specific heat, thus testing the validity of Fisher's relation
for nanoparticles. We show that Co3O4 nanoparticles constitute a unique
aniferromagnetic system which develops a magnetic moment in the paramagnetic
state because of antiferromagnetic correlations and enters into a blocked state
above the N\'eel temperature.

long threads in high-resolution images. In H-alpha observations of filaments,
some threads can be observed for only 5 - 20 minutes before they seem to fade
and eventually disappear, suggesting that these threads may have very short
lifetimes. The presence of an instability might be the cause of this quick
disappearance. Here, we study the thermal instability of prominence threads as
an explanation of their sudden disappearance from H-alpha observations. We
model a prominence thread as a magnetic tube with prominence conditions
embedded in a coronal environment. We assume a variation of the physical
properties in the transverse direction, so that the temperature and density
continuously change from internal to external values in an inhomogeneous
transitional layer representing the particular prominence-corona transition
region (PCTR) of the thread. We use the nonadiabatic and resistive
magnetohydrodynamic equations, which include terms due to thermal conduction
parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, radiative losses, heating,
and magnetic diffusion. We combine both analytical and numerical methods to
study linear perturbations from the equilibrium state, focusing on unstable
thermal solutions. We find that thermal modes are unstable in the PCTR for
temperatures higher than 80,000 K, approximately. These modes are related to
temperature disturbances that can lead to changes in the equilibrium due to
rapid plasma heating or cooling. For typical prominence parameters, the
instability time scale is of the order of a few minutes and is independent of
the form of the temperature profile within the PCTR of the thread. This result
indicates that thermal instability may play an important role for the short
lifetimes of threads in the observations.

versions of the proportional hazards and accelerated failure time (AFT) models.
In many time to event studies, the time of first observation is arbitrary, in
the sense that no risk modifying event occurs. This is particularly common in
epidemiological studies. We show formally that, in these situations, it is not
sensible to take the first observation as the time origin, either in AFT or
proportional hazards type models. Instead, we advocate using age of the subject
as the time scale. We account for the fact that baseline observations may be
made at different ages in different patients via a two stage procedure. First,
we marginally regress any potentially age-varying covariates against age,
retaining the residuals. These residuals are then used as covariates in the
fitting of either an AFT model or a proportional hazards model. We call the
procedures residual accelerated failure time (RAFT) regression and residual
proportional hazards (RPH) regression respectively. We compare standard AFT
with RAFT, and demonstrate superior predictive ability of RAFT in real
examples. In epidemiology, this has real implications in terms of risk
communication to both patients and policy makers.

birth (duplication and transfer) and death (loss) to explain the evolution of
gene families. First, we review birth-and-death models of family size evolution
and their implications in light of the universal features of family size
distribution observed across different species and the three domains of life.
Subsequently, we proceed to recent developments on models capable of more
completely considering information in the sequences of homologous gene families
through the probabilistic reconciliation of the phylogenetic histories of
individual genes with the phylogenetic history of the genomes in which they
have resided. To illustrate the methods and results presented, we use data from
the HOGENOM database, demonstrating that the distribution of homologous gene
family sizes in the genomes of the Eukaryota, Archaea and Bacteria exhibit
remarkably similar shapes. We shown that these distributions are best described
by models of gene family size evolution where for individual genes the death
(loss) rate is larger than the birth (duplication and transfer) rate, but new
families are continually supplied to the genome by a process of origination.
Finally, we use probabilistic reconciliation methods to take into consideration
additional information from gene phylogenies, and find that, for prokaryotes,
the majority of birth events are the result of transfer.

to reach near the vicinity of the target entity represented by a basis state in

there is a high probability of finding the target entity. However, the number
of times quantum rotation transform is to be applied for reaching near the
vicinity of the target is a function of the number of target entities present
in the unsorted database, which is generally unknown. A wrong estimate of the
number of target entities can lead to overshooting or undershooting the
targets, thus reducing the success probability. Some proposals have been made
to overcome this limitation. These proposals either employ quantum counting to
estimate the number of solutions or fixed point schemes. This paper proposes a
new scheme for stopping the application of quantum rotation transformation on
reaching near the targets by measurement and subsequent processing to estimate
the distance of the state vector from the target states. It ensures a success
probability, which is at least greater than half for all the ratios of the
number of target entities to the total number of entities in a database, which
are less than half. The search problem is trivial for remaining possible
ratios. The proposed scheme is simpler than quantum counting and more efficient
than the known fixed-point schemes. It has same order of computational
complexity as canonical Grover's search algorithm but is slow by a factor of

burst starting location is dependent upon the accelerated electron spectral
index and the spatial acceleration region size, but weakly dependent on the
density of energetic electrons for relatively intense electron beams. Using
this relationship and the observed anti-correlation, we estimate the height and
vertical extent of the acceleration region, giving values of around 50 Mm and
10 Mm respectively. The inferred acceleration height and size suggests that
electrons are accelerated well above the soft X-ray loop-top, which could be
consistent with the electron acceleration between 40 Mm and 60 Mm above the

This stress eventually concentrates in the vicinity of the null point forming a
local current sheet through which magnetic reconnection takes place. The aim is
to look for a steady state evolution of the current sheet dynamics which may
provide scaling relations for various characteristic parameters of the system.
The evolution is followed by solving numerically the non-ideal MHD equations in
a Cartesian domain. The null point is embedded in an initially constant density
and temperature plasma. It is shown that a quasi-steady reconnection process
can be set up at a 3D null by continuous shear driving. It appears that a true
steady state in unlikely to be realised as the current layer tends to grow
until restricted by the geometry of the computational domain and imposed
driving profile. However, ratios between characteristic quantities clearly
settle after some time to stable values -- so that the evolution is
quasi-steady. The experiments show a number of scaling relations, but they do
not provide a clear consensus for extending to lower magnetic resistivity or
faster driving velocities. More investigations are needed to fully clarify the
properties of current sheets at magnetic null points.

flares, such as scaling laws observed in the distribution functions of
characteristic parameters, are reproduced after this state has been reached.
Results: Our results show that Self Organized Criticality is indeed reached
when applying specific loading and relaxation rules. Power law indices obtained
from the distribution functions of the modeled flaring events are in good
agreement with observations. Single power laws (peak and total flare energy) as
well as power laws with exponential cutoff and double power laws (flare
duration) are obtained. The results are also compared with observational X-ray
data from GOES satellite for our active-region sample. Conclusions: We conclude
that well-known statistical properties of flares are reproduced after the
system has reached Self Organized Criticality. A significant enhancement of our
refined Cellular Automaton model is that it commences the simulation from
observed vector magnetograms, thus facilitating energy calculation in physical
units. The model described in this study remains consistent with fundamental
physical requirements, and imposes physically meaningful driving and

is difficult to be observed owing to the short duration and X-ray/ultraviolet
(UV)-peaked spectra. After the first observation from the rising phase reported
in 2008, its observability at high redshift is attracting enormous attention.
We perform multigroup radiation hydrodynamics calculations of explosions for
evolutionary presupernova models with various main-sequence masses $M_{\rm
MS}$, metallicities $Z$, and explosion energies $E$. We present multicolor
light curves of shock breakout in Type II plateau SNe, being the most frequent
core-collapse SNe, and predict apparent multicolor light curves of shock
breakout at various redshifts $z$. We derive the observable SN rate and
reachable redshift as functions of filter $x$ and limiting magnitude $m_{x,{\rm
lim}}$ by taking into account an initial mass function, cosmic star formation
history, intergalactic absorption, and host galaxy extinction. We propose a
realistic survey strategy optimized for shock breakout. For example, the
$g'$-band observable SN rate for $m_{g',{\rm lim}}=27.5$ mag is 3.3 SNe
degree$^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$ and a half of them locates at $z\geq1.2$. It is clear
that the shock breakout is a beneficial clue to probe high-$z$ core-collapse
SNe. We also establish ways to identify shock breakout and constrain SN
properties from the observations of shock breakout, brightness, time scale, and

influences the remaining ones, the former group is also influenced by the
remaining ones by at least a proportional amount. Models involving symmetric
interconnections and models in which a weighted average of the agent values is
conserved are special cases. We prove that such systems always converge. We
give a sufficient condition on the evolving interaction topology for the limit
values of two agents to be the same. Conversely, we show that if our condition
is not satisfied, then these limits are generically different. These results
allow treating systems where the agent interactions are a priori unknown, e.g.,
random or determined endogenously by the agent values. We also derive
corresponding results for discrete-time systems.

sufficiently general to accommodate not just the standard case but also recent

degrees of belief. The diagrammatic framework is stated in the graphical
language of symmetric monoidal categories and of compact structures and
Frobenius structures therein, in which Bayesian inversion boils down to
transposition with respect to an appropriate compact structure. We characterize
classical Bayesian inference in terms of a graphical property and demonstrate
that our approach eliminates some purely conventional elements that appear in
common representations thereof, such as whether degrees of belief are
represented by probabilities or entropic quantities. We also introduce a
quantum-like calculus wherein the Frobenius structure is noncommutative and
show that it can accommodate Leifer's calculus of `conditional density
operators'. The notion of conditional independence is also generalized to our
graphical setting and we make some preliminary connections to the theory of
Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct a graphical
Bayesian calculus within any dagger compact category.

{\mu}W/cm^2. Here t {\equiv} 1-T/T_{\lambda}, T_{\lambda} is the transition
temperature in the limit of zero q, and T_c is the transition temperature at

T_{\lambda} which can be described by the power law {\rho} =
(t/t0)^{-(m{\nu}+{\alpha})} where t0 = (q/q0)^x. However, the singularity is
supplanted by the transition to a more highly dissipative phase at T_c(q) <

in a series of YBa2Cu3O6+x from the deep pseudogapped state to slight
overdoping. Accurate determinations of the SCF conductivity versus temperature
and magnetic field have been achieved. Their joint quantitative analyses with
respect to Nernst data allow us to establish that thermal fluctuations
following the Ginzburg-Landau(GL) scheme are dominant for nearly optimally
doped samples. The deduced coherence length xi(T) is in perfect agreement with
a gaussian (Aslamazov-Larkin) contribution for 1.01Tc<T<1.2Tc. A phase
fluctuation contribution might be invoked for the most underdoped samples in a
T range which increases when controlled disorder is introduced by electron
irradiation. For all dopings we evidence that the fluctuations are highly
damped when increasing T or H. The data permits us to define a field Hc^prime
and a temperature Tc^prime above which the SCF are fully suppressed. The
analysis of the fluctuation magnetoconductance in the GL approach allows us to
determine the critical field Hc2(0). The actual values of Hc^prime(0) and
Hc2(0) are found quite similar and both increase with hole doping. These
depairing fields, which are directly connected to the magnitude of the SC gap,
do therefore follow the Tc variation which is at odds with the sharp decrease
of the pseudogap T* with increasing hole doping. This is on line with our
previous evidence that T* is not the onset of pairing. We finally propose a
three dimensional phase diagram including a disorder axis, which allows to
explain most peculiar observations done so far on the diverse cuprate families.
