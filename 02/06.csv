{\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu} of simulated clusters with various ages and
metallicities. Except for the confirmed peak (RC peak) of {\Delta}{\nu} of
red-clump (RC) stars, i.e. core-helium burning stars, there are a gap and a
main sequence (MS) peak in the distributions of {\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu} of
young clusters. The gap corresponds mainly to the Hertzsprung gap phase of
evolution. The RC peak is caused by the fact that the radius of many RC stars
near the zero-age horizontal branch concentrates in a certain range. The MS
peak also results from the fact that many MS stars which are located in a
certain mass range have an approximate radius in the early phase of MS. The MS
peak barely exists in the simulated clusters with age < 1.0 Gyr. The location
of the MS peak moves to a lower frequency with increasing age or metallicity,
which may be applied to constrain the age and metallicity of young clusters.
For the simulated clusters with Z = 0.02, the frequency of the location of the
dominant RC peak increases with age when age < 1.2 Gyr, and then decreases with
age when age > 1.2 Gyr; but it scarcely varies when age > 2.4 Gyr. This is
relative to the degeneracy of the hydrogen-exhausted core at the time of helium
ignition. In addition, the RC peak is not sensitive to the metallicity,
especially for the clusters with age > 2.4 Gyr. Asteroseismical observation for
clusters with age < 2.4 Gyr may aid in testing the theory of the degeneracy of
the hydrogen-exhausted core. Moreover, for the clusters with 1.1 M{\odot} <
M_hook < 1.3 M{\odot}, there are a MS gap and a peak on the left of the MS gap
in the distributions of{\nu}_max and {\Delta}{\nu}, which may be applied to
constrain the central hydrogen abundance of stars in the MS gap and the peak.

stationary deflagration is unstable with respect to one-dimensional
perturbations if the energy barrier of the magnets is sufficiently high in
comparison with the release of Zeeman energy at the front; their ratio may be
interpreted as an analogue to the Zeldovich number, as found in problems of
combustion. When the Zeldovich number exceeds a certain critical value, a
stationary deflagration front becomes unstable and propagates in a pulsating
regime. Analytical estimates for the critical Zeldovich number are obtained.
The linear stage of the instability is investigated numerically by solving the
eigenvalue problem. The nonlinear stage is studied using direct numerical
simulations. The parameter domain required for experimental observations of the

onto rotating magnetized stars from a turbulent, MRI-driven disk. The angular
momentum is transported outward by the magnetic stress of the turbulent flow
with a rate corresponding to a Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter alpha\approx
0.01-0.04. The result of the disk-magnetosphere interaction depends on the
orientation of the poloidal field in the disk relative to that of the star at
the disk-magnetosphere boundary. If fields have the same polarity, then the
magnetic flux is accumulated at the boundary and blocks the accretion which
leads to the accumulation of matter at the boundary. Subsequently, this matter
accretes to the star in outburst before accumulating again. Hence, the cycling,
`bursty' accretion is observed. If the disc and stellar fields have opposite
polarity, then the field reconnection enhances the penetration of the disk
matter towards the deeper field lines of the magnetosphere. However, the
magnetic stress at the boundary is lower due to the field reconnection. This
decreases the accretion rate and leads to smoother accretion at a lower rate.
Test simulations show that in the case of higher accretion rate corresponding
to alpha=0.05-0.1, accretion is bursty in cases of both polarities. On the
other hand, at much lower accretion rates corresponding to alpha < 0.01,
accretion is not bursty in any of these cases. We conclude that the episodic,
bursty accretion is expected during periods of higher accretion rates in the
disc, and in some cases it may alternate between bursty and smooth accretion,
if the disk brings the poloidal field of alternating polarity. We find that a
rotating, magnetically-dominated corona forms above and below the disk, and
that it slowly expands outward, driven by the magnetic force.

population coding, distributed and overlapping representations. Multivariate
pattern analysis, i.e., the prediction of behavioural variables from brain

the spatial structure of the image is not taken into account in standard

one-dimensional convex optimization), its properties and approximations are
given. It is shown to have two-regime behavior: when the nominal outage
probability decreases (e.g. by increasing the SNR), the compound outage first
decreases linearly down to a certain threshold (related to relative entropy
distance) and then only logarithmically (i.e. very slowly), so that no
significant further decrease is possible. The compound outage depends on the
relative entropy distance and the nominal outage only, all other details
(nominal fading and noise distributions) being irrelevant. The transmit signal
distribution optimized for the nominal channel distribution is shown to be also
optimal for the whole class of distributions. The effect of swapping the
distributions in relative entropy is investigated and an error floor effect is
established. The compound outage probability under Lp distance constraint is
also investigated. The obtained results hold for a generic channel model
(arbitrary nominal fading and noise distributions).

networks, with respect to adversarial disturbances that reduce the link flow
capacities. A dynamical flow network is modeled as a system of ordinary
differential equations derived from mass conservation laws on a directed
acyclic graph with a single origin-destination pair and a constant inflow at
the origin. Routing policies regulate the way the inflow at a non-destination
node gets split among its outgoing links as a function of the current particle
density, while the outflow of a link is modeled to depend on the current
particle density on that link through a flow function. The dynamical flow
network is called partially transferring if the total inflow at the destination
node is asymptotically bounded away from zero, and its weak resilience is
measured as the minimum sum of the link-wise magnitude of all disturbances that
make it not partially transferring. The weak resilience of a dynamical flow
network with arbitrary routing policy is shown to be upper-bounded by the
network's min-cut capacity, independently of the initial flow conditions.
Moreover, a class of distributed routing policies that rely exclusively on
local information on the particle densities, and are locally responsive to
that, is shown to yield such maximal weak resilience. These results imply that
locality constraints on the information available to the routing policies do
not cause loss of weak resilience. Some fundamental properties of dynamical
flow networks driven by locally responsive distributed policies are analyzed in
detail, including global convergence to a unique limit flow.

and $F_{n}$ the associated empirical distribution function. The
Glivenko-Cantelli theorem states that with probability 1, $F_{n}$ converges
uniformly to $F$. In so doing it describes the macroscopic structure of
$\{x_{i}\}_{1}^{n}$, however it is insensitive to the position of individual
points. Indeed any subset of $o(n)$ points can be perturbed at will without
disturbing the convergence. We provide several refinements of the
Glivenko-Cantelli theorem which are sensitive not only to the global structure
of the sample but also to individual points. Our main result provides
conditions that guarantee simultaneous concentration of all order statistics.
The example of main interest is the normal distribution.

by transferring energy from one cavity to the other. We also analyze the
occurrence of normal-mode splitting (NMS). We find that a hybridization of the

time series of high spatial resolution photospheric intensity, vector magnetic

disappearance of the Evershed flow and penumbra grains occur at nearly the same
time and are associated with changes of the inclination angle of the magnetic
field from vertical to more horizontal. This supports the idea that Evershed
flow is a result of thermal convection in the inclined field lines. The dark
core of the bright penumbral filament also appears coincidental with the
Evershed flow. However, the dark-cored bright filament survives at least for
10-20 minutes after the disappearance of the Evershed flow. The heat input into
the bright filament continues after the end of heat transfer by the Evershed
flow. This suggests that local heating along the bright filament is important
to maintain the brightness of the bright filament in addition to the heat
transfer by the Evershed flow.

  Environment",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the growing number of the elderly, we see a greater demand for home
care, and the vision of pervasive computing is also floating into the domain of
the household that aims to build a smart home which can assist inhabitants
(users) to live more conveniently and harmoniously. Such health-care pervasive
applications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in
diverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The
core challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess
occurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according
to the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive
computing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right
information and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a
context-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most
important component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level
description of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the
model multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge.
Based on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach
using CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task
recognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing.
Moreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is
also discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task
supporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle
and environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results
of the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good
efficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity
inference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life.

magnetic Mn ion connected to metallic leads. By employing a numerical
renormalization group technique we show that depending on the value of
ferromagnetic coupling strength between the local electronic spin and the
magnetic moment of the Mn, two distinct Kondo regimes exist. In the weak
coupling limit, the system can be found in a completely screened Kondo state
describing a local magnetic moment decoupled from the rest of the system. In
contrast, in the strong coupling regime the quantum dot spin and the local
magnetic moment form a single large-spin entity partially Kondo screened. A
crossover between these two regimes can be suitably tuned by varying the tunnel
coupling between the quantum dot electron and the leads. The model investigated
here is also suitable to study magnetic molecules adsorbed on a metallic
surface. The rich phenomenology of these systems is reflected in the
conductance across the system.

models is an important issue and can help our understanding of galactic
dynamical evolution. In this paper, we deal with this issue by applying the
techniques of the Smaller (and Generalized) ALingment Indices, SALI (and GALI),
to extensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating numerically the
equations of motion in a barred galaxy potential. We estimate first the
fraction of chaotic and regular orbits for the two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) case
(where the galaxy extends only in the (x,y)-space) and show that it is a
non-monotonic function of the energy. For the three DOF extension of this model
(in the z-direction), we give similar estimates, both by exploring different
sets of initial conditions and by varying the model parameters, like the mass,
size and pattern speed of the bar. We find that regular motion is more abundant
at small radial distances from the center of the galaxy, where the relative
non-axisymmetric forcing is relatively weak, and at small distances from the
equatorial plane, where trapping around the stable periodic orbits is
important. We also find that the variation of the bar pattern speed, within a
realistic range of values, does not affect much the phase space's fraction of
regular and chaotic motions. Using different sets of initial conditions, we
show that chaotic motion is dominant in galaxy models whose bar component is
more massive, while models with a fatter or thicker bar present generally more
regular behavior. Finally, we find that the fraction of orbits that are chaotic
correlates strongly with the bar strength.

select red sequence objects, neither can it be used for galaxy classification
without additional observational data such as spectra or high-resolution
images, nor to identify blue galaxies at unknown redshifts. We show that adding
the near ultraviolet colour to the optical CMD reveals a tight relation in the
three-dimensional colour-colour-magnitude space smoothly continuing from the
""blue cloud"" to the ""red sequence"". We found that 98 per cent of 225,000
low-redshift (Z<0.27) galaxies follow a smooth surface g-r=F(M,NUV-r) with a
standard deviation of 0.03-0.07 mag making it the tightest known galaxy
photometric relation. There is a strong correlation between morphological types
and integrated NUV-r colours. Rare galaxy classes such as E+A or tidally
stripped systems become outliers that occupy distinct regions in the 3D
parameter space. Using stellar population models for galaxies with different
SFHs, we show that (a) the (NUV-r, g-r) distribution is formed by objects
having constant and exponentially declining SFR with different characteristic
timescales; (b) colour evolution for exponentially declining models goes along
the relation suggesting its weak evolution up-to a redshift of 0.9; (c)
galaxies with truncated SFHs have very short transition phase offset from the
relation thus explaining the rareness of E+A galaxies. This relation can be
used as a powerful galaxy classification tool when morphology remains
unresolved. Its mathematical consequence is the photometric redshift estimates
from 3 broad-band photometric points. This approach works better than most
existing photometric redshift techniques applied to multi-colour datasets.
Therefore, the relation can be used as an efficient selection technique for
galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.3<Z<0.8) using optical imaging surveys.
