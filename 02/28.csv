electromechanical response on applied voltage demonstrates a pronounced
crossover from the linear to the quadratic law and then to the sub-linear law
with a factor of 2/3 under the voltage increase. The temperature dependence of
the electromechanical response as determined by the interplay between the

or the sound of ocean waves breaking on the beach are representations of the
physical world that have been created by the dynamic interactions of thousands
of neurons in our brains. How the brain mediates perceptions, creates thoughts,
stores memories and initiates actions remains one of the most profound puzzles
in biology, if not all of science. A key to a mechanistic understanding of how
the nervous system works is the ability to analyze the dynamics of neuronal
networks in the living organism in the context of sensory stimulation and
behaviour. Dynamic brain properties have been fairly well characterized on the
microscopic level of individual neurons and on the macroscopic level of whole
brain areas largely with the help of various electrophysiological techniques.
However, our understanding of the mesoscopic level comprising local populations
of hundreds to thousands of neurons (so called 'microcircuits') remains
comparably poor. In large parts, this has been due to the technical
difficulties involved in recording from large networks of neurons with
single-cell spatial resolution and near- millisecond temporal resolution in the
brain of living animals. In recent years, two-photon microscopy has emerged as
a technique which meets many of these requirements and thus has become the
method of choice for the interrogation of local neural circuits. Here, we
review the state-of-research in the field of two-photon imaging of neuronal
populations, covering the topics of microscope technology, suitable fluorescent
indicator dyes, staining techniques, and in particular analysis techniques for
extracting relevant information from the fluorescence data. We expect that
functional analysis of neural networks using two-photon imaging will help to
decipher fundamental operational principles of neural microcircuits.

for analyzing distributed algorithms is to look at the assumptions they make on

network dynamics. In particular, we ask how a given property on the evolution

algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to propose the combination of
two existing tools in this direction: local computations by means of graph
relabelings, and evolving graphs. Such a combination makes it possible to
express fine-grained properties on the network dynamics, then examine what
impact those properties have on the execution at a precise, intertwined, level.
We illustrate the use of this framework through the analysis of three simple
algorithms, then discuss general implications of this work, which include (i)
the possibility to compare distributed algorithms on the basis of their
topological requirements, (ii) a formal hierarchy of dynamic networks based on
these requirements, and (iii) the potential for mechanization induced by our
framework, which we believe opens a door towards automated analysis and
decision support in dynamic networks.

or when it appears as an electron-hole pairing between different bands of
electron and hole character. As an example we treat the two-orbital model for
iron-based superconductors. For small magnetic moments the spin excitations
look similar in both scenarios. Going to larger interactions and larger
magnetic moments, the difference between both scenarios becomes striking. While
in the excitonic scenario the spin waves form a closed structure over the
entire Brillouin zone and the particle-hole continuum is gapped, the spin
excitations in the orbital scenario can be treated as spin waves only in a
close vicinity to the ordering momenta. The origin of this is a gapless
electronic structure with Dirac cones which is a source of large damping. We
analyze our results in connection with recent neutron scattering measurements

index is significantly flatter than the high frequency spectral index near the
cluster core. This trend would be consistent with an outgoing merger shock as
the origin of the relic emission. New X-ray data from XMM-Newton reveal
interesting structures in the intracluster medium pressure, entropy and
temperature maps. The pressure maps show an overall low pressure core
co-incident with the radio halo emission, while the temperature maps reveal
multiple regions of cool emission within the central regions of Abell 2256. The
two cold fronts in Abell 2256 both appear to have motion in similar directions.

for detailed sports statistics. The goal of statistical analysis in sports is a
simple one: to eliminate subjective analysis. In this paper, we review previous
work that attempts to analyze various aspects in sports by using ideas from
Markov Chains, Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
The unifying goal of these works is to achieve an accurate representation of
the player's ability, the sport, or the environmental effects on the player's
performance. With the prevalence of cheap computation, it is possible that
using techniques in Artificial Intelligence could improve the result of
statistical analysis in sport. This is best illustrated when evaluating

for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, where bonds are Gaussian
distributed. In particular, we determine the variation of the ground state
energy densities with \alpha, their finite-size corrections, measure their
fluctuations, and analyze the local field distribution. We find that the
energies themselves at infinite system size attain universally the
Parisi-energy of the SK as long as the second moment of P(J) exists (\alpha>2),
and compare favorably with recent one-step replica symmetry breaking
predictions well below \alpha=2. At and just below \alpha=2, the simulations
deviate significantly from theoretical expectations. The finite-size
investigation reveals that the corrections exponent \omega decays from the SK
value \omega_{SK}=2/3 already well above \alpha=2, at which point it reaches a
minimum. This result is justified with a speculative calculation of a random
energy model with Levy bonds. The exponent \rho that describes the variations

the corresponding space-time structures by the consideration of a particular
problem of time irreversibility. The fundamental time irreversibility problem
consists in the following: how to reconcile the time-reversible microscopic
dynamics and the irreversible macroscopic one. The recently proposed functional
formulation of mechanics is aimed to solve this problem. The basic concept of
this formulation is not a material point and a trajectory, like in the
traditional formulation of mechanics, but a probability density function. Even
if we deal with a single particle (not with an ensemble of particles), we
describe its state as a probability density function. We justify this approach
using measurement theory. A particular problem in the framework of the
irreversibility problem is the derivation of the Boltzmann kinetic equation
from the equations of microscopic dynamics. We propose a procedure for
obtaining the Boltzmann equation from the Liouville equation based on the BBGKY
hierarchy, the recently proposed functional formulation of classical mechanics,
and the distinguishing between two scales of space-time, i.e., macro- and
microscale. The notion of a space-time structure is introduced. It takes into
account not only the space-time itself (i.e., a pseudo-Riemannian manifold),
but also a characteristic length and time. The space-time structures form a
hierarchy in sense that the initial values for the processes on the microscopic
space-time structure (interactions of the particles) are assigned from the
processes on the macroscopic one (kinetic phenomena).

several drawbacks of the celebrated Cucker-Smale (C-S) model. The proposed
model does not only take into account the distance between agents, but instead,
the influence between agents is scaled in term of their relative distance.
Consequently, our model does not involve any explicit dependence on the number
of agents; only their geometry in phase space is taken into account. The use of
relative distances destroys the symmetry property of the original C-S model,
which was the key for the various recent studies of C-S flocking behavior. To
this end, we introduce here a new framework to analyze the phenomenon of
flocking for a rather general class of dynamical systems, which covers systems
with non-symmetric influence matrices. In particular, we analyze the flocking
behavior of the proposed model as well as other strongly asymmetric models with
""leaders"".
  The methodology presented in this paper, based on the notion of active sets,
carries over from the particle to kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions. In
particular, we discuss the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposed model, and
prove its unconditional flocking for slowly decaying influence functions.

soft matter systems poses the intriguing possibility that these structures can
be realized in a broad range of nano- and micro-scale assemblies. It has been
theorized that soft matter quasicrystals and approximants are largely
entropically stabilized, but the thermodynamic mechanism underlying their
formation remains elusive. Here, we use computer simulation and free energy
calculations to demonstrate a simple design heuristic for assembling
quasicrystals and approximants in soft matter systems. Our study builds on
previous simulation studies of the self-assembly of dodecagonal quasicrystals
and approximants in minimal systems of spherical particles with complex,
highly-specific interaction potentials. We demonstrate an alternative
entropy-based approach for assembling dodecagonal quasicrystals and
approximants based solely on particle functionalization and shape, thereby
recasting the interaction-potential-based assembly strategy in terms of
simpler-to-achieve bonded and excluded-volume interactions. Here, spherical
building blocks are functionalized with mobile surface entities to encourage
the formation of structures with low surface contact area, including
non-close-packed and polytetrahedral structures. The building blocks also
possess shape polydispersity, where a subset of the building blocks deviate
from the ideal spherical shape, discouraging the formation of close-packed
crystals. We show that three different model systems with both of these
features -- mobile surface entities and shape polydispersity -- consistently
assemble quasicrystals and/or approximants. We argue that this design strategy
can be widely exploited to assemble quasicrystals and approximants on the nano-
and micro- scales. In addition, our results further elucidate the formation of
soft matter quasicrystals in experiment.

a set of matrices with the same low dimension as that of a single agent. The
notion of discrete-time consensus region is then introduced and analyzed. For

having a bounded consensus region in the form of an open unit disk, provided
that each agent is stabilizable and detectable. An algorithm is further
presented to construct a protocol to achieve consensus with respect to all the

where the agents have no poles outside the unit circle,an algorithm is proposed
to construct a protocol having an origin-centered disk of radius $\delta$

constraint related to the unstable eigenvalues of a single agent for the case
where each agent has a least one eigenvalue outside the unit circle. Finally,

over a large temperature range and therefore throughout a large portion of the

the formation of corundum is sensitive to the pressure. The mid-temperature
region is dominated by Fe(s) and silicates such as Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3 . The
chemistry of forsterite and enstatite are strictly related, and our simulations
show a sequence of forsterite-enstatite-forsterite with decreasing temperature.
In the low temperature regions (T < 600 K) a range of iron compounds and
sulfides form. We also run simulations using the ideal solution model and see
clear differences in the resulting condensation sequences with changing

forsterite replaces enstatite in the low temperature region is sensitive to the
solution model. Our results show that the ideal solution model is often a poor
approximation to experimental data at most temperatures important in
protoplanetary discs. We find some important differences in the resulting

of brain size with body mass or stature.
  Results: The absolute change of endocranial volume in the study samples was
significantly greater than would be predicted from observed changes in body
mass or stature.
  Conclusions: The evolution of smaller brains in many recent human populations
must have resulted from selection upon brain size itself or on other features
more highly correlated with brain size than are gross body dimensions. This
selection may have resulted from energetic or nutritional demands in Holocene
populations, or to life history constraints on brain development.

single pole on the positive real axis. Continuing \cite{GSE}, we derive
asymptotics for the numbers of three basic types of decomposable combinatorial
structures (or, equivalently, ideal gas models in statistical mechanics) of
size $n$, when their Dirichlet generating functions have multiple simple poles
on the positive real axis. Examples to which our theorem applies include ones
related to vector partitions and quantum field theory. Our asymptotic formula
for the number of weighted partitions disproves the belief accepted in the

rightmost pole.

approaches used in many areas of modern physics such as quantum field theory
and the SLOCC protocols familiar in quantum information. Although the
mathematical methods are the same the meaning of the gauge group will be
different. The measure we introduce, `twist', is constructed as a Wilson loop
from a correlation induced holonomy. The measure can be understood as the
global asymmetry of the bipartite correlations in a loop of three or more
qubits; if the holonomy is trivial (the identity matrix), the bipartite
correlations can be globally untwisted using general local qubit operations,
the gauge group of our theory, which turns out to be the group of Lorentz
transformations familiar from special relativity. If it is not possible to
globally untwist the bipartite correlations in a state globally using local
operations, the twistedness is given by a non-trivial element of the Lorentz
group, the correlation induced holonomy. We provide several analytical examples
of twisted and untwisted states for three qubits, the most elementary
non-trivial loop one can imagine.

formula for N_c=3 and N_f=2 in the chiral limit, i.e. m_q=0. The
momentum-dependent constituent-quark mass is computed as a function of T,
together with the Harrington-Shepard caloron solution in the large-N_c limit.
In addition, we take into account the imaginary quark-chemical potential mu_I =
A_4, indentified as the traced Polayakov-loop (Phi) as an order parameter for
the Z(N_c) symmetry, characterizing the confinement (intact) and deconfinement
(spontaneously broken) phases. As a consequence, we observe the crossover of
the chiral (chi) order parameter sigma^2 and Phi. It also turns out that the
critical temperature for the deconfinement phase transition, T^Z_c is lowered
by about (5~10) % in comparison to the case with the constant constituent-quark
mass. This behavior can be understood by considerable effects from the partial
chiral restoration and nontrivial QCD vacuum on the Phi. Numerical results show
that the crossover transitions occur at (T^chi_c,T^Z_c) ~ (216,227) MeV.

we investigate the effect of spatial long-range correlations in the lithology

In the model, the resistance of a coast section to erosion depends on the local
lithology configuration as well as on the number of neighboring sea sides. For
weak sea forces, the sea is trapped by the coastline and the eroding process
stops after some time. For strong sea forces erosion is perpetual. The
transition between these two regimes takes place at a critical sea force,
characterized by a fractal coastline front. For uncorrelated landscapes, we
obtain, at the critical value, a fractal dimension D=1.33, which is consistent
with the dimension of the accessible external perimeter of the spanning cluster
in two-dimensional percolation. For sea forces above the critical value, our
results indicate that the coastline is self-affine and belongs to the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. In the case of landscapes generated
with power-law spatial long-range correlations, the coastline fractal dimension
changes continuously with the Hurst exponent H, decreasing from D=1.34 to 1.04,
for H=0 and 1, respectively. This nonuniversal behavior is compatible with the
multitude of fractal dimensions found for real coastlines.

gravitational wave background generated by domain walls which are produced if
some discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken in the early universe. We apply
two different methods to calculate the gravitational wave spectrum: One is to
calculate the gravitational wave spectrum directly from numerical simulations,
and another is to calculate it indirectly by estimating the unequal time
anisotropic stress power spectrum of the scalar field. Both analysises indicate
that the slope of the spectrum changes at two characteristic frequencies
corresponding to the Hubble radius at the decay of domain walls and the width
of domain walls, and that the spectrum between these two characteristic
frequencies becomes flat or slightly red tilted. The second method enables us
to evaluate the GW spectrum semi-analytically for the frequencies which can not
be resolved in the finite box lattice simulations, but relies on the
assumptions for the unequal time correlations of the source.

aspherical flows. It presents unique features such as a pair of high-velocity
dusty polar blobs and a mirror-symmetric rotating pattern in the inner lobes.
Imaging monitoring of the evolution of the nebula in the past decade is
presented. We determine the proper motions of the dusty blobs, which infer a
new distance estimate of 1.3+-0.2 kpc, a total nebular size of 0.8 pc, a speed
of 147 km/s, and a kinematical age of 2500 yr. The corkscrew geometry of the
inner rotating pattern is quantified. Different recombination timescales for
different ions explain the observed surface brightness distribution. According
to the images taken after 1999, the pattern rotates with a period of 92+-4 yr.
On the other hand, the analysis of images taken between 1952 and 1977 measures
a faster angular velocity. If the phenomenon were related to orbital motion,
this would correspond to a modest orbital eccentricity (e=0.10+-0.05), and a
slightly shorter period (86+-5 yr). New features have appeared after 2005 on
the west side of the lobes and at the base of the pattern. The geometry and
travelling times of the rotating pattern support our previous proposal that the
phenomenon is produced by a collimated spray of high velocity particles (jet)
from the central source, which excites the walls of the inner cavity of M 2-9,
rather than by a ionizing photon beam. The speed of such a jet would be
remarkable: between 11000 and 16000 km/s. The rotating-jet scenario may explain
the formation and excitation of most of the features observed in the inner
nebula, with no need for additional mechanisms, winds, or ionization sources.
All properties point to a symbiotic-like interacting binary as the central
source of M 2-9.

We find that the growth of domains formed by interconnected locally preferred

rationalize the different dynamic behaviors of the models. At low temperature,
the spatial extension of the structurally correlated domains, evaluated at
fixed relaxation time, increases with the fragility of the models and is
systematically reduced by truncating the attractions. In view of these results,
proper inclusion of many-body static correlations in theories of the glass

at a magnetic field below Feshbach resonance, where the s-wave scattering
length is large (close to inter-particle distance) and positive. These
experiments have been performed over a wide range of conditions, with
temperatures and trap depths spanning over three decades. Different groups have
come up with different explanations, among them the emergence of Stoner
ferromagnetism. Here, we show that this maximum is a consequence of two major
steps. The first is the establishment of a population of shallow dimers, which
is the combined effect of dimer formation through three-body recombination, and
the dissociation of shallow dimers back to atoms through collisions. The
dissociation process will be temperature dependent, and is affected by Pauli
blocking at low temperatures. The second is the relaxation of shallow dimers
into tightly bound dimers through atom-dimer and dimer-dimer collisions.
  We have constructed a simple set of rate equations describing these
processes. Remarkably, even with only a few parameters, these equations
reproduce the loss rate observed in all recent experiments, despite their
widely different experimental conditions. Our studies show that the location of
the maximum loss rate depends crucially on experimental parameters such as trap
depth and temperature. These extrinsic characters show that this maximum is not
a reliable probe of the nature of the underlying quantum states. The physics of
our equations also explains some general trends found in current experiments.

images are often down sampled and transmitted at low bit rates resulting in a

from several blurred, noisy and down sampled low resolution images using a
computational process know as super resolution reconstruction. Super-resolution
is the process of combining multiple aliased low-quality images to produce a
high resolution, high-quality image. The problem of recovering a high
resolution image progressively from a sequence of low resolution compressed
images is considered. In this paper we propose a novel DCT based progressive
image display algorithm by stressing on the encoding and decoding process. At
the encoder we consider a set of low resolution images which are corrupted by
additive white Gaussian noise and motion blur. The low resolution images are
compressed using 8 by 8 blocks DCT and noise is filtered using our proposed
novel zonal filter. Multiframe fusion is performed in order to obtain a single
noise free image. At the decoder the image is reconstructed progressively by
transmitting the coarser image first followed by the detail image. And finally
a super resolution image is reconstructed by applying our proposed novel
adaptive interpolation technique. We have performed both objective and
subjective analysis of the reconstructed image, and the resultant image has
better super resolution factor, and a higher ISNR and PSNR. A comparative study
done with Iterative Back Projection (IBP) and Projection on to Convex Sets

  with unbounded random coefficients","17 pages",,,,"math.PR math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a model for the propagation of a driven interface through a
random field of obstacles. The evolution equation, commonly referred to as the
Quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model, is a semilinear parabolic equation with a
constant driving term and random nonlinearity to model the influence of the
obstacle field. For the case of isolated obstacles centered on lattice points
and admitting a random strength with exponential tails, we show that the
interface propagates with a finite velocity for sufficiently large driving
force. The proof consists of a discretization of the evolution equation and a
supermartingale estimate akin to the study of branching random walks.

the A15 and fcc-Cs_{3}C_{60} phases for increasing hydrostatic pressure through
the transition at p_{c} from a Mott insulator to a superconductor. We evidence
that for p>> p_{c} the (T_{1}T)^{-1} data above T_{c} display metallic like
Korringa constant values which match quantitatively previous data taken on
other A_{3}C_{60} compounds. However below the pressure for which T_{c} goes
through a maximum, (T_{1}T)^{-1} is markedly increased with respect to the
Korringa values expected in a simple BCS scenario. This points out the
importance of electronic correlations near the Mott transition. For p > p_{c}
singular T dependences of (T_{1}T)^{-1} are detected for T >> T_{c}. It will be
shown that they can be ascribed to a large variation with temperature of the
Mott transition pressure p_{c} towards a liquid-gas like critical point, as
found at high T for usual Mott transitions.

self-assembly of two-dimensional structures called polyominoes. The model
includes rules that encode interactions between sets of square tiles that drive
the self-assembly process. The relationship between the model's rule set and
its resulting self-assembled structure can be viewed as a genotype-phenotype
map and incorporated into a genetic algorithm. The rule sets evolve under
selection for specified target structures. The corresponding, complex fitness
landscape generates rich evolutionary dynamics as a function of parameters such
as the population size, search space size, mutation rate, and method of
recombination. Furthermore, these systems are simple enough that in some cases
the associated model genome space can be completely characterised, shedding
light on how the evolutionary dynamics depends on the detailed structure of the
fitness landscape. Finally, we apply the model to study the emergence of the
preference for dihedral over cyclic symmetry observed for homomeric protein
tetramers.

BRST symmetry arising within the Gribov-Zwanziger framework can be converted
into a linear breaking, while preserving the nilpotency of the BRST operator.
Due to its compatibility with the Quantum Action Principle, the linearly broken
BRST symmetry directly translates into a set of Slavnov-Taylor identities. We
show that these identities guarantee the multiplicative renormalizability of
both Gribov-Zwanziger and Refined Gribov-Zwanziger theories to all orders. The
known property that only two renormalization factors are needed is recovered.
The non-renormalization theorem of the gluon-ghost-antighost vertex as well as
the renormalization factor of the Gribov parameter are derived within the
linearly broken formulation.
