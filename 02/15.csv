shown to significantly improve the quality of the SFH results. For the cluster
centre, we find a best-fitting solution corresponding to prolonged star
formation for a for a timespan of 460 Myr, instead of the two peaks separated
by 200 Myr favoured by a previous work based on isochrone fitting. Remarkably,
our global best-fitting solution provides an excellent fit to the data - with
chi^2 and residuals close to the theoretical minimum - reproducing all the CMD
features including the dual red clump. The results for a larger ring region
around the centre indicate even longer star formation, but in this case the

in memoryless networks with or without delay constraints, i.e., quality of
service guarantee. We analyze a wide class of setups, including unicast,
multicast, and broadcast, and two main cooperative approaches, namely: energy
accumulation (EA) and mutual information accumulation (MIA). We provide a
generalized algorithmic formulation of the problem that encompasses all those
cases. We investigate the similarities and differences of EA and MIA in our
generalized formulation. We prove that the broadcast and multicast problems
are, in general, not only NP hard but also o(log(n)) inapproximable. We break
these problems into three parts: ordering, scheduling and power control, and
propose a novel algorithm that, given an ordering, can optimally solve the
joint power allocation and scheduling problems simultaneously in polynomial
time. We further show empirically that this algorithm used in conjunction with
an ordering derived heuristically using the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
yields near-optimal performance in typical settings. For the unicast case, we
prove that although the problem remains NP hard with MIA, it can be solved
optimally and in polynomial time when EA is used. We further use our algorithm
to study numerically the trade-off between delay and power-efficiency in
cooperative broadcast and compare the performance of EA vs MIA as well as the
performance of our cooperative algorithm with a smart noncooperative algorithm
in a broadcast setting.

is unfeasible to keep track of all of them within a single simulation. As a
consequence some form of coarse-graining must be applied. In this work we use
the Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics scheme. We describe a particular
implementation of no-slip boundary conditions upon a solid surface, capable of
providing correct force s on the solid bypassing the calculation of the
velocity profile or the stre ss tensor in the fluid near the surface. As an
application we measure the friction on a spherical particle, when it is placed
in a bulk fluid and when it is confined in a slit. We show that the
implementation of the no-slip boundary conditions leads to an enhanced Ensko g
friction, which can be understood analytically. Because of the long-range
nature of hydrodynamic interactions, the Stokes friction obtained from the
simulations is sensitive of the simulation box size. We address this topic for
the slit geometry, showing that that the dependence on the system size differs
very much from what is expected in a 3D system, where periodic boundary

entities ranging from gamma-ray bursts at cosmological distances to the Sun
itself. Many of these present potential hazards to the biosphere: on timescales
long compared with human history, the probability of an event intense enough to
disrupt life on the land surface or in the oceans becomes large. We enumerate
the known sources of radiation and characterize their intensities at the Earth
and rates or upper limits on these quantities. When possible, we estimate a
""lethal interval"", our best estimate of how often a major extinction-level
event is probable given the current state of knowledge; we base these estimates
on computed or expected depletion of stratospheric ozone. In general, moderate
level events are dominated by the Sun, but the far more severe infrequent
events are probably dominated by gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. We note for
the first time that so-called ""short-hard"" gamma-ray bursts are a substantial
threat, comparable in magnitude to supernovae and greater than that of the
higher-luminosity long bursts considered in most past work. Given their
precursors, short bursts may come with little or no warning.

a deterministic finite-state machine (FSM) is considered. The empirical mean is
used as a reference as it is the constant that fits a given sequence within a
minimal square error. With this reference, a reasonable prediction performance
is the regret, namely the excess square-error over the reference loss, the
empirical variance. The paper analyzes the tradeoff between the number of
states of the universal FSM and the attainable regret. It first studies the
case of a small number of states. A class of machines, denoted Degenerated
Tracking Memory (DTM), is defined and the optimal machine in this class is
shown to be the optimal among all machines for small enough number of states.
Unfortunately, DTM machines become suboptimal as the number of available states
increases. Next, the Exponential Decaying Memory (EDM) machine, previously used
for predicting binary sequences, is considered. While this machine has poorer
performance for small number of states, it achieves a vanishing regret for
large number of states. Following that, an asymptotic lower bound of
O(k^{-2/3}) on the achievable regret of any k-state machine is derived. This
bound is attained asymptotically by the EDM machine. Furthermore, a new
machine, denoted the Enhanced Exponential Decaying Memory machine, is shown to
outperform the EDM machine for any number of states.

of the microscopic laws governing the motion of the molecules we derive a set
of non-local self-consistent equations for the singlet phase-space distribution
functions. The theory is shown to reproduce the hydrodynamic equations for the
densities of each species, the total momentum and the local temperature. The
non ideal gas interaction term is separated into a contribution due to the
repulsive part, which is treated by means of the revised Enskog theory for hard
spheres, and an attractive contribution treated within the random phase
approximation. The present formulation accounts for the effects of the density
and velocity inhomogeneities both on the thermodynamic and transport properties
of the fluid. In a special limit, where one species is massive and diluted, the
theory leads to a description which is formally identical to the dynamic
density functional equation governing the time evolution of a colloidal system.
  The derivation also determines the dependence of the friction coefficient,
appearing in the dynamic density functional theory, on the microscopic
parameters of the solvent. However, the predicted value takes into account only
the collisional contributions to the friction and not the Stokes friction of

thermal energy, positron density and positron temperature on large amplitude
IASWs are studied by analysis of the pseudopotential structure. It is found
that in regions that the streaming speed of plasma fluid is larger than that of
solitary wave, by increasing the streaming speed of plasma fluid the depth and
width of potential well increases and resulting in narrower solitons with
larger amplitude. This behavior is opposite for the case where the streaming
speed of plasma fluid is smaller than that of solitary wave. On the other hand,
increase of the thermal energy results in wider solitons with smaller
amplitude, because the depth and width of potential well decreases in that
case. Additionally, the maximum soliton amplitude increases and the width
becomes narrower as a result of increase in positron density. It is shown that
varying the positron temperature does not have considerable effect on the width
and amplitude of IASWs. The existence of stationary soliton-like arbitary
amplitude waves is also predicted in fully relativistic electron-positron-ion

extended into the soft domain. However, in order to describe the data, these
Monte Carlos need an additional infrared cutoff k_min with a value k_min ~ 2-3
GeV which is not small, and which increases with collider energy. Here we
explain the physical origin of the large k_min. Using an alternative model
which matches the `soft' high-energy hadron interactions smoothly on to
perturbative QCD at small x, we demonstrate that this effective cutoff k_min is
actually due to the strong absorption of low k_t partons. The model embodies
the main features of the BFKL approach, including the diffusion in transverse
momenta, lnk_t, and an intercept consistent with resummed next-to-leading log
corrections. Moreover, the model uses a two-channel eikonal framework, and
includes the contributions from the multi-Pomeron exchange diagrams, both
non-enhanced and enhanced. The values of a small number of physically-motivated
parameters are chosen to reproduce the available total, elastic and proton
dissociation cross section (pre-LHC) data. Predictions are made for the LHC,

forecast. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of 4d-VAR
(four dimensional variational data assimilation) for exigent forecasting (XF)
of severe storm precursors and to thereby characterize the probability of a
worst-case scenario. 4d-VAR is designed to adjust the initial conditions (IC)
of a numerical weather prediction model consistent with the uncertainty of the
prior estimate of the IC while at the same time minimizing the misfit to
available observations. For XF the same approach is taken but instead of
fitting observations, a measure of damage or loss or an equivalent proxy is
maximized or minimized. To accomplish this will require development of a
specialized cost function for 4d-VAR. When 4d-VAR solves the XF problem a
by-product will be the value of the background cost function that provides a
measure of the likelihood of occurrence of the forecast exigent conditions.
4d-VAR has been previously applied to a special case of XF in hurricane
modification research. A summary of a case study of Hurricane Andrew (1992) is
presented as a prototype of XF. The study of XF is expected to advance
forecasting high impact weather events, refine methodologies for communicating
warning and potential impacts of exigent weather events to a threatened
population, be extensible to commercially viable products, such as forecasting
freezes for the citrus industry, and be a useful pedagogical tool.

superprocess over a stochastic flow in dimensions $d\leq3$, which through
constructive methods, results in a Tanaka-like representation. The superprocess
over a stochastic flow is a superprocess with dependent spatial motion, and

However, another assumption of Bell's theorem is the use of classical logic.
One part of this assumption is the principle of ""ontic definiteness"", that is,
that it must in principle be possible to assign definite truth values to all
propositions treated in the theory. Once the logical setting is clarified
somewhat, it can be seen that rejecting this principle does not in any way
undermine the type of causal principle used by Bell. Without ontic

orbits a large black hole of mass $M \gg m$. This system emits gravitational
waves (GWs) that have a radiation-reaction effect on the particle's motion.
EMRIs (extreme--mass-ratio inspirals) of this type will be important GW sources
for LISA; LISA's data analysis will require highly accurate EMRI GW templates.
In this article I outline the ""Capra"" research program to try to model EMRIs
and calculate their GWs \textit{ab initio}, assuming only that $m \ll M$ and
that the Einstein equations hold. Here we treat the EMRI spacetime as a
perturbation of the large black hole's ""background"" (Schwarzschild or Kerr)
spacetime and use the methods of black-hole perturbation theory, expanding in
the small parameter $m/M$. The small body's motion can be described either as
the result of a radiation-reaction ""self-force"" acting in the background
spacetime or as geodesic motion in a perturbed spacetime. Several different
lines of reasoning lead to the (same) basic $\O(m/M)$ ""MiSaTaQuWa"" equations of
motion for the particle. Surprisingly, for a nonlinear field theory such as
general relativity, modelling the small body as a point particle works well.
The particle's own field is singular along the particle worldline so it's
difficult to formulate a meaningful ""perturbation"" theory or equations of
motion there. I discuss ""mode-sum"" and ""puncture-function"" regularization
schemes that resolve this difficulty and allow practical self-force
calculations, and I outline an important recent calculation of this type.
  Most Capra research to date has used 1st order perturbation theory. To obtain
the very high accuracies needed to fully exploit LISA's observations of the
strongest EMRIs, 2nd order perturbation theory will probably be needed.

representative for an average Swift sample burst, such as a jet half opening
angle of 0.1 rad and a source redshift of z = 2.23, we have created synthetic
light curves at 1.5 keV with artificial errors while accounting for Swift
instrument biases as well. A large set of these light curves have been
generated and analyzed using a Monte Carlo approach. Single and broken power
law fits are compared. We find that for increasing observer angle, the jet
break quickly becomes hard to detect. This holds true even when the observer
remains well within the jet opening angle. We find that the odds that a Swift
light curve from a randomly oriented 0.1 radians jet at z = 2.23 will exhibit a
jet break at the 3 sigma level are only 12 percent. The observer angle
therefore provides a natural explanation for the lack of perceived jet breaks

general relativity. Thus, they are suitable as toy models for studying 1)
problem of time in quantum gravity strategies, in particular timeless,
semiclassical and histories theory approaches and combinations of these. 2)
Various other quantum-cosmological issues, such as structure
formation/inhomogeneity and the significance of uniform states. The relational
quadrilateral is more useful in these respects than previously investigated
simpler RPM's as it possesses linear constraints, nontrivial subsystems and its
configuration space is a nontrivial complex-projective space. In this paper, I
investigate the submanifold of collinear configurations, the submanifolds with
a single-particle collision, the square configurations and regions of the
configuration space for which such as approximate collinearity, approximate
squareness and approximate triangularity hold. I consider both mirror image
identified and unidentified shapes, as well as both distinguishable and
indistinguishable particle labels. I find the following CP^2 coordinate systems

quadrilateralland, are magnitudes of the Jacobi vectors and anisoscelesnesses
of the triangles formed between them. 2) Gibbons-Pope type coordinates, which,
for quadrilateralland, are the sum and difference of relative angles between

of state (EoS). We explore the parameter ranges for a parameterized EoS for
quark stars. We find that strange stars, made of absolutely stable strange
quark matter, comply with the new constraint only if effects from the strong
coupling constant and color-superconductivity are taken into account. Hybrid
stars, compact stars with a quark matter core and an hadronic outer layer, can
be as massive as 2 M_sun, but only for a significantly limited range of
parameters. We demonstrate that the appearance of quark matter in massive stars
depends crucially on the stiffness of the nuclear matter EoS. We show that the
masses of hybrid stars stay below the ones of hadronic and pure quark stars,
due to the softening of the EoS at the quark-hadron phase transition.

the interplay between the absolute and relative pairings of K-theory and cyclic
cohomology for an exact sequence of Banach algebras which in the present
context takes the form $0\to J\to A\to B\to 0$, with J dense and
holomorphically closed in the C^*-algebra of the foliation and B depending only
on boundary data. Of particular importance is the definition of a relative
cyclic cocycle $(\tau_{GV}^r,\sigma_{GV})$ for the pair $A\to B$; $\tau_{GV}^r$
is a cyclic cochain on A defined through a regularization, \`a la Melrose, of
the usual Godbillon-Vey cyclic cocycle $\tau_{GV}$; $\sigma_{GV}$ is a cyclic
cocycle on B, obtained through a suspension procedure involving $\tau_{GV}$ and
a specific 1-cyclic cocycle (Roe's 1-cocycle). We call $\sigma_{GV}$ the eta
cocycle associated to $\tau_{GV}$. The Atiyah-Patodi-Singer formula is obtained
by defining a relative index class $\Ind (D,D^\partial)\in K_* (A,B)$ and

estimating the underlying density distribution with minimal assumptions.
Although they can be shown to achieve asymptotic estimation optimality for any

significant computation dominated by kernel summations. In this paper we
present an improvement to the dual-tree algorithm, the first practical kernel
summation algorithm for general dimension. Our extension is based on the
series-expansion for the Gaussian kernel used by fast Gauss transform. First,
we derive two additional analytical machinery for extending the original
algorithm to utilize a hierarchical data structure, demonstrating the first
truly hierarchical fast Gauss transform. Second, we show how to integrate the
series-expansion approximation within the dual-tree approach to compute kernel
summations with a user-controllable relative error bound. We evaluate our
algorithm on real-world datasets in the context of optimal bandwidth selection
in kernel density estimation. Our results demonstrate that our new algorithm is
the only one that guarantees a hard relative error bound and offers fast
performance across a wide range of bandwidths evaluated in cross validation

is unsatisfactory, since such results are interesting from a combinatorial

submodular and bisubmodular minimisation. We consider the Min and Max CSP

efficiently obtaining hardness results in our setting. This allow us to prove
the result without relying on computer-assisted case analyses (which otherwise

of their XUV disks and utilize spectral energy distribution fitting to measure
their stellar ages and masses through comparison with Starburst99 population
synthesis models of instantaneous burst populations. We find that the median
age of outer disk associations in our sample is ~100 Myr with a large
dispersion that spans the entire range of our models (1 Myr-1 Gyr). This
relatively evolved state for most associations addresses the observed dearth of
Halpha emission in some outer disks, as Halpha can only be observed in star
forming regions younger than ~10 Myr. The large age dispersion is robust
against variations in extinction (in the range E(B-V)=0-0.3 mag) and variations
in the upper end of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). In particular, we
demonstrate that the age dispersion is insensitive to steepening of the IMF, up
to extreme slopes.

density map for this whole region serves, not only as an illustration of the

metal-poor red giant branch stars at the distance of M31. The fifth
over-density, And XXVII, is embedded in an extensive stream of such stars and
is possibly the remnant of a strong tidal disruption event. All five satellites
have metallicities and luminosities typical of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and
continue the trend whereby the brighter dwarf spheroidal satellites of M31
generally have much larger half-light radii than their Milky Way counterparts.
With an extended sample of M31 satellite galaxies we also revisit the spatial

based on two sets of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed with
the TreePM-SPH GADGET code. The first set includes about 140 clusters with
masses above 5x10^13 M_sun/h (30 having mass above 10^15 M_sun/h), that have
been simulated with (i) non-radiative physics and including (ii) cooling, star
formation, chemical enrichment and the effect of supernova feedback triggering
galactic ejecta. This large statistics is used to quantify the robustness of
the scaling relations, to determine their redshift evolution and to calibrate
their intrinsic scatter and its distribution. We use a smaller set of clusters
including 18 halos with masses above 5x10^13 M_sun/h to test the robustness of
mass proxies against changing the physical processes included in simulations
(thermal conduction, artificial viscosity, cooling and star formation, galactic
winds and AGN feedback). We find the M-Y_X scaling relation to be the least
sensitive one to variations of the ICM physics, with its slope and redshift
evolution close to the self-similar model predictions. The distribution of the
scatter around the best-fitting relations is close to a log-normal one. M_gas
has the smallest scatter in mass, with values of sigma_lnM = 0.04-0.06,
depending on the physics included in the simulation, and with a mild dependence
on redshift. The M-T relation is the one with the largest scatter, with
sigma_lnM > 0.1 at z=0, increasing to > 0.15 at z=1. The intrinsic scatter in
the M-Y_X relation is slightly larger than in the M-M_gas relation. These
results confirm that both Y_X and M_gas mass proxies are well suited for
cosmological applications of future large X-ray surveys. [abridged]

wireless communication scenarios, including dense cellular networks and
cognitive networks with spectrum sharing by multiple service providers.
Although multipleantenna (MIMO) signal processing is known to offer useful
degrees of freedom to cancel interference, extreme-value theoretic analysis
recently showed that, even in the absence of MIMO processing, the scaling law
of the capacity in the number of users for a multi-cell network with and
without inter-cell interference was asymptotically identical provided a simple
signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) maximizing scheduler is
exploited. This suggests that scheduling can help reduce inter-cell
interference substantially, thus possibly limiting the need for
multiple-antenna processing. However, the convergence limits of interference
after scheduling in a multi-cell setting are not yet identified. In this paper1
we analyze such limits theoretically. We consider channel statistics under
Rayleigh fading with equal path loss for all users or with unequal path loss.
We uncover two surprisingly different behaviors for such systems. For the equal
path loss case, we show that scheduling alone can cause the residual
interference to converge to zero for large number of users. With unequal path
loss however, the interference are shown to converge in average to a nonzero
constant. Simulations back our findings.

Given bandwidth constraints, the goal of the problem is to minimize the number
of rounds required to obtain a random walk sample. Das Sarma et al. [PODC'10]
show that a random walk of length $\ell$ on a network of diameter $D$ can be
performed in $\tilde O(\sqrt{\ell D}+D)$ time. A major question left open is
whether there exists a faster algorithm, especially whether the multiplication
of $\sqrt{\ell}$ and $\sqrt{D}$ is necessary.
  In this paper, we show a tight unconditional lower bound on the time
complexity of distributed random walk computation. Specifically, we show that
for any $n$, $D$, and $D\leq \ell \leq (n/(D^3\log n))^{1/4}$, performing a
random walk of length $\Theta(\ell)$ on an $n$-node network of diameter $D$
requires $\Omega(\sqrt{\ell D}+D)$ time. This bound is {\em unconditional},
i.e., it holds for any (possibly randomized) algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first lower bound that the diameter plays a role of
multiplicative factor. Our bound shows that the algorithm of Das Sarma et al.
is time optimal.
  Our proof technique introduces a new connection between {\em bounded-round}
communication complexity and distributed algorithm lower bounds with $D$ as a
trade-off parameter, strengthening the previous study by Das Sarma et al.

complexity of the pointer chasing problem. Our technique can be of independent
interest and may be useful in showing non-trivial lower bounds on the

sections allowed by the limits from direct detection experiments. Second, we
considered that both scattering cross sections are of the same order, with the
aim of studying the dependencies of the capture rate on stellar elements other

different in the two scenarios. Furthermore, we quantified the uncertainties on
the computed capture rate (C_x) and on the ratio between the luminosities from
DM annihilations and thermonuclear reactions (L_x/L_nuc) derived from an
imprecise knowledge of the stellar structure and DM parameters. For instance,
while an uncertainty of 10% on the typical DM velocity leads to similar errors
on the computed C_x and L_x/L_nuc, the same uncertainty on the stellar mass
becomes more relevant and duplicates the errors. Our results may be used to
evaluate the reliability of the computed capture rate for the hypothetical use

Observable parameters of binary millisecond pulsars e.g. mass of the pulsar,
mass of the companion, spin period of the pulsar, orbital period, orbital
eccentricity etc are used to probe the past accretion history of the
millisecond pulsars. But unfortunately in these studies, binding energy of the
neutron star is not considered commonly. We show that the effect of the binding
energy is significant in the estimation of the amount of mass accretion and
thus should be incorporated in models for binary evolutions. Moreover,
different Equations of State for dense matter give different values for the
accreted mass for the same amount of increase in the gravitational mass of the
neutron star implying the need of constraining dense matter Equations of State
even to understand the spin-up procedure properly.

find a slope of 0.22 +/- 0.04 for the power-law relationship between size and

ionize at these luminosities. In fact, we find that the active galactic nucleus
is effectively ionizing the interstellar medium over the full extent of the
host galaxy. Broad (~300-1000 km/s) linewidths across the galaxies reveal that
the gas is kinematically disturbed. Furthermore, the rotation curves and
velocity dispersions of the ionized gas remain constant out to large distances,
in striking contrast to normal and starburst galaxies. We argue that the gas in
the entire host galaxy is significantly disturbed by the central active
galactic nucleus. While only ~10^7-10^8 M_sun worth of gas are directly
observed to be leaving the host galaxies at or above their escape velocities,
these estimates are likely lower limits because of the biases in both mass and
outflow velocity measurements and may in fact be in accord with expectations
from recent feedback models. Additionally, we report the discovery of two dual
obscured quasars, one of which is blowing a large-scale (~10 kpc) bubble of

the -omic sciences. A fundamental question in Statistics, Data Analysis and
Classification, is the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset,
usually established via internal validation measures. Despite the wealth of
internal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently
proposed, some of them specifically for microarray data. In this dissertation,
a study of internal validation measures is given, paying particular attention
to the stability based ones. Indeed, this class of measures is particularly
prominent and promising in order to have a reliable estimate the number of
clusters in a dataset. For those measures, a new general algorithmic paradigm
is proposed here that highlights the richness of measures in this class and
accounts for the ones already available in the literature. Moreover, some of
the most representative validation measures are also considered. Experiments on
12 benchmark datasets are performed in order to assess both the intrinsic
ability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and
its merit relative to the other measures. The main result is a hierarchy of
internal validation measures in terms of precision and speed, highlighting some
of their merits and limitations not reported before in the literature. This
hierarchy shows that the faster the measure, the less accurate it is. In order
to reduce the time performance gap between the fastest and the most precise
measures, the technique of designing fast approximation algorithms is
systematically applied. The end result is a speed-up of many of the measures
studied here that brings the gap between the fastest and the most precise
within one order of magnitude in time, with no degradation in their prediction
power. Prior to this work, the time gap was at least two orders of magnitude.

The accretion shocks
on the first and second Larson's cores involve radiative processes and are thus
characteristic of radiative shocks. In this study, we explore the formation of
the first Larson's core and characterize the radiative and dynamical properties
of the accretion shock, using both analytical and numerical approaches. We
develop both numerical RHD calculations and a semi-analytical model that
characterize radiative shocks in various physical conditions, for radiating or
barotropic fluids. Then, we perform 1D spherical collapse calculations of the
first Larson's core, using a grey approximation for the opacity of the
material. We consider three different models for radiative transfer, namely:
the barotropic approximation, the FLD approximation and the more complete M1
model. We investigate the characteristic properties of the collapse and of the
first core formation. Comparison between the numerical results and our
semi-analytical model shows that this latter reproduces quite well the core
properties obtained with the numerical calculations. The accretion shock on the
first Larson core is found to be supercritical, implying that all the accretion
shock energy on the core is radiated away. The FLD approximation is found to
agree quite well with the results based on the M1 model, and is thus
appropriate to study the star formation process. In contrast, the barotropic
approximation does not correctly describe the thermal properties of the gas
during the collapse. We show that a consistent treatment of radiation and
hydrodynamics is mandatory to correctly handle the cooling of the gas during
the core formation and thus to obtain the correct mechanical and thermal
properties for this latter.

node-based verification-based (NB-VB) recovery algorithms in the context of
compressive sensing. These algorithms are particularly interesting due to their
low complexity (linear in the signal dimension $n$). The asymptotic analysis
predicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\ell$ in
the asymptotic regime where $n \rightarrow \infty$. The analysis is similar in
nature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze
iterative decoding algorithms. To perform the analysis, a message-passing
interpretation of NB-VB algorithms is provided. This interpretation lacks the
extrinsic nature of standard message-passing algorithms to which density
evolution is usually applied. This requires a number of non-trivial
modifications in the analysis. The analysis tracks the average performance of
the recovery algorithms over the ensembles of input signals and sensing
matrices as a function of $\ell$. Concentration results are devised to
demonstrate that the performance of the recovery algorithms applied to any
choice of the input signal over any realization of the sensing matrix follows
the deterministic results of the analysis closely. Simulation results are also
provided which demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic analysis matches the
performance of recovery algorithms for large but finite values of $n$. Compared
to the existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based
on numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the
proposed method is much simpler and more accurate.

evidence of recent tidal interactions. We find that a significant fraction of

represents a ""frosting"" on top of a large old stellar population, and has been
seen in previous studies of elliptical galaxies. Further, the dry merger
candidates include a higher fraction of starforming galaxies relative to a
control sample without tidal features. We therefore conclude that the star
formation in these massive ellipticals is likely triggered by merger activity.
Our data suggest that the mergers responsible for the observed tidal features

admit a `Maxwell form' in which the shear component of the stress vector plays
the role of the electric field, and the vorticity plays the role of the
magnetic field. Conversely, the set of dynamic Maxwell equations are strict
mathematical corollaries from the governing equations of the incompressible
elastic medium. This suggests that the nature of `electromagnetic field' may
actually be related to an elastic continuous medium. The analogy is complete if
the medium is assumed to behave as fluid in shear motions, while it may still
behave as elastic solid under compressional motions. Then the governing
equations of the elastic fluid are re-derived in the Eulerian frame by
replacing the partial time derivatives by the properly invariant (frame
indifferent) time rates. The `Maxwell from' of the frame indifferent
formulation gives the frame indifferent system that is to replace the Maxwell
system. This new system comprises terms already present in the classical
Maxwell equations, alongside terms that are the progenitors of the
Biot--Savart, Oersted--Ampere's, and Lorentz--force laws. Thus a frame
indifferent (truly covariant) formulation of electromagnetism is achieved from
a single postulate that the electromagnetic field is a kind of elastic (partly

of tensor rank and matrix rank, has applications in algebraic complexity,
quantum computing and communication complexity. This paper differs from Raz's
paper in that it leverages existing results to show unconditional bounds while
Raz's result relies on some assumptions.
  We show a super-exponential separation between monotone and non-monotone
computation in the non-commutative model, and thus provide a strong solution to
Nisan's question \cite{Nis1991} in algebraic complexity. More specifically, we
exhibit that there exists a homogeneous algebraic function $f$ of degree $d$
($d$ even) on $n$ variables with the monotone algebraic branching program (ABP)
complexity $\Omega(d^2\log n)$ and the non-monotone ABP complexity $O(d^2)$.
  In Bell's theorem\cite{Bel1964, CHSH1969}, a basic assumption is that players
have free will, and under such an assumption, local hidden variable theory
still cannot predict the correlations produced by quantum mechanics. Using
tools from monotone rank, we show that even if we disallow the players to have
free will, local hidden variable theory still cannot predict the correlations
produced by quantum mechanics.
  We generalize the log-rank conjecture \cite{LS1988} in communication
complexity to the multiparty case, and prove that for super-polynomial parties,
there is a super-polynomial separation between the deterministic communication
complexity and the logarithm of the rank of the communication tensor. This
means that the log-rank conjecture does not hold in high dimensions.

discretized by finite element methods. The novel implementation makes use of
Python and the FEniCS package, the combination of which leads to compact and
reusable code, where model- and solver-specific code resemble closely the
mathematical formulation of equations and algorithms. The presented ideas and

extend recent results that characterize the response in terms of spectral

transmission delays and in the number of refractory states, and by developing a
nonperturbative approximation to the steady state network response. We confirm
our theoretical results with numerical simulations. We find that the steady
state response amplitude is inversely proportional to the duration of
refractoriness, which reduces the maximum attainable dynamic range. We also
find that transmission delays alter the time required to reach steady state.
Importantly, neither delays nor refractoriness impact the general prediction
that criticality and maximum dynamic range occur when the largest eigenvalue of
the adjacency matrix is unity.

are the core algorithmic problems on Euclidean lattices. They are central to
the applications of lattices in many problems of communications and
cryptography. Kannan's \emph{embedding technique} is a powerful technique for
solving the approximate CVP, yet its remarkable practical performance is not
well understood. In this paper, the embedding technique is analyzed from a
\emph{bounded distance decoding} (BDD) viewpoint. We present two complementary
analyses of the embedding technique: We establish a reduction from BDD to
Hermite SVP (via unique SVP), which can be used along with any Hermite SVP
solver (including, among others, the Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov\'asz (LLL)
algorithm), and show that, in the special case of LLL, it performs at least as
well as Babai's nearest plane algorithm (LLL-aided SIC). The former analysis
helps to explain the folklore practical observation that unique SVP is easier
than standard approximate SVP. It is proven that when the LLL algorithm is
employed, the embedding technique can solve the CVP provided that the noise
norm is smaller than a decoding radius $\lambda_1/(2\gamma)$, where $\lambda_1$
is the minimum distance of the lattice, and $\gamma \approx O(2^{n/4})$. This
substantially improves the previously best known correct decoding bound $\gamma
\approx {O}(2^{n})$. Focusing on the applications of BDD to decoding of
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, we also prove that BDD of the
regularized lattice is optimal in terms of the diversity-multiplexing gain
tradeoff (DMT), and propose practical variants of embedding decoding which
require no knowledge of the minimum distance of the lattice and/or further
improve the error performance.

functional differential equations. We explicitly solve these equations, under
simplifying assumptions, for various NASA spacecraft. This shows that the
differences from Newtonian gravity, though tiny within the solar system, are
just appropriate to explain the flyby anomaly as a v/c effect due to earth's
rotation. The differences can, however, be large in the case of a spiral
galaxy, and we show that the combined velocity drag from a large number of
co-rotating stars enormously speeds up a test particle. Thus, the non-Newtonian
behaviour of rotation curves in a spiral galaxy may be explained as being due
to velocity drag rather than dark matter. RGT can also be tested in the
laboratory. It necessitates a reappraisal of current laboratory methods of
determining the Newtonian gravitational constant G. Since RGT makes no
speculative assumptions, its refutation would have serious implications across
physics.

Clouds are selected at redshifts $0\leq z\leq 3$ with the Minimal Spanning Tree
(MST) technique. The main properties of so selected clouds are analyzed in 3D
space and with the core sampling approach, what allows us to compare estimates
of the DM LSS evolution obtained with two different techniques and to clarify
some important aspects of the LSS evolution. In both cases we find that regular
redshift variations of the mean characteristics of the DM LSS are accompanied
only by small variations of their PDFs, what indicates the self similar
character of the DM LSS evolution. The high degree of relaxation of DM
particles compressed within the LSS is found along the shortest principal axis
of clouds. We see that the internal structure of selected clouds depends upon
the mass resolution and scale of perturbations achieved in simulations. It is
found that the low mass tail of the PDFs of the LSS characteristics depends

upon the liquid structure. At higher temperatures (above around half the
critical temperature) we find that the predominant effect of the interface is
to reduce the local density, which significantly suppresses the local cluster
populations. At lower temperatures, however, pronounced interfacial layering is
found. This appears to be connected with significant orientational ordering of

perpendicular and parallel to the interface respectively. At all temperatures,
we find that the population of five-fold symmetric structures is suppressed,

matter in the Sun. In this class of models, dark matter annihilates first into
metastable mediators, which subsequently decay into Standard Model particles.
If the mediators are long lived, they will propagate out from the dense solar
core before decaying. High energy neutrinos undergo absorption in the Sun. In
the standard scenario in which neutrinos are produced directly in the centre of
the Sun, absorption is relevant for E > 100 GeV, resulting in a significant
suppression of the neutrino spectrum beyond E ~ 1 TeV. In the secluded dark
matter scenario, the neutrino signal is greatly enhanced because neutrinos are
injected away from the core, at lower density. Since the solar density falls
exponentially with radius, metastable mediators have a significant effect on
the neutrino flux, even for decay lengths which are small compared to the solar
radius. Moreover, since neutrino detection cross sections grow with energy,
this enhancement of the high energy region of the neutrino spectrum would have
a large effect on overall event rates.

  Workshop (ITA), January, 2011",,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.SY math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider decentralized restless multi-armed bandit problems with unknown
dynamics and multiple players. The reward state of each arm transits according
to an unknown Markovian rule when it is played and evolves according to an
arbitrary unknown random process when it is passive. Players activating the
same arm at the same time collide and suffer from reward loss. The objective is
to maximize the long-term reward by designing a decentralized arm selection
policy to address unknown reward models and collisions among players. A
decentralized policy is constructed that achieves a regret with logarithmic
order when an arbitrary nontrivial bound on certain system parameters is known.
When no knowledge about the system is available, we extend the policy to
achieve a regret arbitrarily close to the logarithmic order. The result finds
applications in communication networks, financial investment, and industrial
engineering.

structures in polarization were restored by extrapolation of the WMAP
polarization data. We present the 6cm total intensity and linear polarization
maps of the surveyed region. We identify two new extended HII regions G98.3-1.6

structures are visible in the polarization maps. Depolarization along the
periphery of a few HII complexes was detected and can be explained by a Faraday
screen model. We discuss some prominent depolarization HII regions, which have
regular magnetic fields of several $\mu$G. Structure functions of U, Q and PI
images of the entire 6cm survey region of 10deg< l < 230deg exhibit much larger

very useful for studying individual objects such as HII regions, which act as
Faraday screens and have high rotation measures and therefore strong regular

of the fast solar wind. Earlier observations show omni-presence of
quasi-periodic disturbances, travelling outward, which is believed to be caused
by the ubiquitous presence of outward propagating waves. These waves, mostly of
compressional type, might provide the additional momentum and heat required for
the fast solar wind acceleration. It has been conjectured that these
disturbances are not due to waves but high speed plasma outflows, which are
difficult to distinguish using the current available techniques. With the
unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution of AIA, we search for these
quasi-periodic disturbances in both plume and interplume regions of the polar
corona. We investigate their nature of propagation and search for a plausible
interpretation. We also aim to study their multi-thermal nature by using three
different coronal passbands of AIA. In almost all the locations chosen, in both
plume and interplume regions we find the presence of propagating quasi-periodic
disturbances, of periodicities ranging from 10-30 min. These are clearly seen
in two channels and in a few cases out to very large distances (~250 arcsec)
off-limb, almost to the edge of the AIA field of view. The propagation speeds
are in the range of 100-170 km/s. The average speeds are different for
different passbands and higher in interplume regions. Observed disturbances are
insensitive to changes in slit width. This indicates that a coherent mechanism
is involved. In addition, the observed propagation speed varies between the
different passpands, implying that these quasi-periodic intensity disturbances
are possibly due to magneto-acoustic waves. The propagation speeds in
interplume region are higher than in the plume region.

only exacerbate the well-known sensitivity to prior assignments, thus producing
less dependable conclusions. Within the subjective framework, both difficulties
can be counteracted by linking priors across models in order to achieve
simplification and compatibility; we discuss links with related objective
approaches. Given an encompassing, or full, model together with a prior on its

variable selection in linear models adopting a conventional $g$-prior;

the fractional abundances of all molecular species are significantly below
their peak values. We show in particular that OH, H$_{2}$O, H$_{3}^{+}$,
H$_{3}$O$^{+}$ and OH$^{+}$ attain large fractional abundances ($\geqslant
10^{-8}$) for $\zeta$ as large as $10^{-12}$ s$^{-1}$. HCO$^{+}$ is a poor
tracer of CRDRs when $\zeta > 10^{-13}$ s$^{-1}$. Sulphur-bearing species may
be useful tracers of CRDRs gas in which $\zeta \sim 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. Ammonia
has a large fractional abundance for $\zeta \leqslant 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ and
nitrogen appears in CN-bearing species at significant levels as $\zeta$
increases, even up to $\sim 10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$. In this paper, we also discuss
our model predictions, comparing them to recent detections in both galactic and
extragalactic sources. We show that they agree well, to a first approximation,
with the observational constraints.

directions, is an example of wall-bounded flow experiencing a transition to
turbulence with an ordered coexistence of turbulent and laminar domains in some
range of Reynolds numbers [R_g,R_t]. When the aspect-ratio is sufficiently
large, this coexistence occurs in the form of alternately turbulent and laminar
oblique bands. As R goes up trough the upper threshold R_t, the bands disappear
progressively to leave room to a uniform regime of featureless turbulence. This
continuous transition is studied here by means of under-resolved numerical
simulations understood as a modelling approach adapted to the long time, large
aspect-ratio limit. The state of the system is quantitatively characterised
using standard observables (turbulent fraction and turbulence intensity inside
the bands). A pair of complex order parameters is defined for the pattern which
is further analysed within a standard Ginzburg--Landau formalism. Coefficients
of the model turn out to be comparable to those experimentally determined for
cylindrical Couette flow.

relative to the hopping amplitude $w$, the gap between the energy levels
gradually diminishes until it closes completely at the critical value

this work is to design a practical solution to the above joint optimization

decide whether to replicate or drop the information, so as to adapt the content
availability to dynamic demands and time-varying network topologies. We
evaluate our mechanism through simulation, by exploring a wide range of

our mechanism, which uses local measurements only, is: (i) extremely precise in

robust against network mobility; (iii) flexible in accommodating various

Sitter-invariant condensates with a sharply defined energy scale are induced by
effective negative-definite relevant or marginal operators, which may or may
not destabilize the CFT. We find this result by explicitly constructing a
`complementarity map' for this model, given by a conformal transformation of
the de Sitter CFT into a static time-frame, which reveals the crunch as an
infinite potential-energy fall in finite time. We show that, quite generically,
the crunch is associated to a finite mass black hole if the de Sitter
O(d,1)-invariance is an accidental IR symmetry, broken down to U(1)xO(d) in the
UV. Any such regularization cuts off the eternity of de Sitter space-time.
Equivalently, the dimension of the Hilbert space propagating into the crunch is
finite only when de Sitter is not eternal.

Hubbard model greatly improve the previous results given by the Slater-Jastrow

this approach, it is possible to have a satisfactory connection with the
strong-coupling regime. Moreover, we show that, for the Hubbard model on the
lattice, backflow correlations are essentially short range, inducing an
effective attraction between empty (holons) and doubly occupied sites
(doublons). In presence of frustration, we report the evidence that the metal
to Mott-insulator transition is marked by a discontinuity of the double

not change the number of holons and doublons, while the other kinetic terms are
continuous across the transition. Finally, we show the estimation of the charge

singlet scalar with an additional discrete symmetry $Z_2$ is introduced to SM.
This additional scalar can be a viable candidate of cold dark matter since the
stability of $S$ is achieved by the application of $Z_2$ symmetry on $S$.
Considering $S$ as a possible candidate of cold dark matter we have solved
Boltzmann's equation to find the freeze out temperature and relic density of
$S$ for Higgs mass 120 GeV in the scalar mass range 5 GeV to 1 TeV. As $HHSS$
coupling $\delta_2$ appearing in Lagrangian depends upon the value of scalar
mass $m_S$ and Higgs mass $m_h$, we have constrained the $m_S - \delta_2$
parameter space by using the WMAP limit on the relic density of dark matter in
the universe and the results of recent ongoing dark matter direct search
experiments namely CDMS-II, CoGeNT, DAMA, EDELWEISS-II, XENON-10, XENON-100.
From such analysis we find two distinct mass regions (a lower and higher mass
domain) for such a dark matter candidate that satisfy both the WMAP limit and
the experimental results considered here. We have estimated the possible
differential direct detection rates and annual variation of total detection
rates for this scalar dark matter candidate $S$ for two detector materials
namely Ge, Xe. Finally we have calculated the $\gamma-$ray flux from the
galactic centre due to annihilation of two 130 GeV scalar dark matter into two
monoenergetic $\gamma-$rays.

potentials along the edges are investigated. Using the Dirac-fermion approach,
we calculate the energy spectrum of an infinitely long nanoribbon of finite
width $w$, terminated by Dirichlet boundary conditions in the transverse
direction. We show that a structured external potential that acts within the
edge regions of the ribbon, can induce a spectral gap and thus switches the
nanoribbon from metallic to insulating behavior. The basic mechanism of this
effect is the selective influence of the external potentials on the spinorial
wavefunctions that are topological in nature and localized along the boundary
of the graphene nanoribbon. Within this single particle description, the
maximal obtainable energy gap is $E_{\rm max}\propto \pi\hbar v_{\rm F}/w$,
i.e., $\approx 0.12$\,eV for $w=$15\,nm. The stability of the spectral gap
against edge disorder and the effect of disorder on the two-terminal
conductance is studied numerically within a tight-binding lattice model. We
find that the energy gap persists as long as the applied external effective
potential is larger than $\simeq 0.55\times W$, where $W$ is a measure of the
disorder strength. We argue that there is a transport gap due to localization
effects even in the absence of a spectral gap.

spectra of brighter (V<20.6) Carina targets collected with the GIRAFFE
multi-object fiber spectrograph at the VLT. The combined sample includes more
than 21,340 individual spectra of ~2,000 stars covering the entire body of the
galaxy. To further improve the statistics, the accurate RV measurements
recently provided by Walker et al.(2007) were also added to the current data
set. We ended up with a sample of ~1,370 RV measurements of candidate Carina
stars that is ~75% larger than any previous Carina RV sample. The mean RV
across the body of the galaxy varies from ~220 km/s at a distance of 7arcmin
(~200 pc) from the center to ~223 km/s at 13arcmin, (~400 pc, 6sigma level) and
flattens out to a constant value of ~221 km/s at larger distances (600 pc,
4sigma level). Moreover and even more importantly, we found that in the Carina
regions where the mean RV is smaller the dispersion is also smaller, and the RV
distribution is more centrally peaked (i.e. the kurtosis attains larger
values). There is evidence of a secondary maximum in RV across the Carina
center (|D|<200 pc). The occurrence of a secondary feature across the Carina
center is also supported by the flat-topped radial distribution based on the
photometric catalog.

Previous observations of the source revealed a radio morphology on pc to kpc
scales consistent with a helical jet model. In our present research, this
source was observed with the VLBA at 86, 43 and 15 GHz on four epochs from 10
May 2003 to 13 March 2005 aiming at studying the structure of the innermost jet
in order to understand the relation between the helical structure and the
astrophysical processes in the central engine. A core-jet structure with six
jet components is identified. The apparent transverse velocities of the six jet
components derived from proper motion measurements are in the range between 3.6
c and 11.6 c. The overall jet shape shows oscillatory morphology with multiple
curvatures on pc scales which might be indicative of a helical pattern. Models
of helical jet are discussed on the basis of both Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H)
instability and jet precession. The K-H instability model shows better
agreement with the observed data. The overall radio structure on the scale from
sub-pc to kpc appears to be fitted with a hydrodynamic model with the
fundamental helical mode in Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. This helical
mode with an initial characteristic wavelength of 0.2 pc is excited at the base
of the jet on the scale of 0.005 pc (or 1000R_s, the typical size of the broad
line region for a super massive black hole of $4.3\times10^8M_{\odot}$). A
presessing jet model can also fit the observed jet structure on the scale
between 10 pc and 300 pc. However, additional astrophysical processes may be
required for the presessing jet model in order to explain the bendings on the
inner jet structure (1 to 10 pc) and re-collimation of the large scale jet
outflow (>300 pc).

high-quality patenting. The models here can also be used to predict an output
indicator for a country, once the appropriate input indicator is known. This
usually is done within a dataset for a single year, but the process can be
extended to predict outputs a few years into the future, if reasonable

a recently proposed model of non-unitary self-gravity inducing localization. As
for other proposals of modifications of Quantum Mechanics in a non-unitary
sense, aimed to account for both unitary evolution and irreversible collapse,
like in the famous Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber and Pearle's models, it turns out
that, for the experimental parameters proposed, no effect is detectable at all.
It is pointed out that the enhancing properties of matter granularity does not
substantially change this conclusion. Parameters have also been exploratively
varied in a certain range beyond the proposed values. It is shown that within
`sensible' parameters, that are not yet attainable within current technology,
the model exhibits a peculiar signature with respect to other collapse models
as far as parameters space is explored. Besides, the calculation offers a way
to see non-unitary gravity at work in a quasi-realistic setting.

visibilities from the single-dish map and calculate the noise of each
visibility based on the RMS noise. Our weighting scheme, though it is applied
to discrete visibilities in this paper, is applicable to grids in uv-space, and
this scheme may advance in future software development. For a realistic amount
of observing time, the sensitivities of the NRO45 and CARMA visibility data
sets are best matched by using the single dish baselines only up to 4-6
kilo-lambda (about 1/4-1/3 of the dish diameter). The synthesized beam size is
determined to conserve the flux between synthesized beam and convolution beam.
The superior uv-coverage provided by the combination of CARMA long baseline

fidelity, which is evidenced by the excellent overlap between even the faint CO

surface and becomes ionized after an ionization front (IF) seen as a bright
peak in Ha maps. We follow the development of an HI region inside the
photoevaporated wind which corresponds to a photodissociated region (PDR) for
most of our models, except those without a FUV flux. For disks that are at a
distance from the source d \geq 0.1 pc, the PDR is thick and the IF is detached
from the disk surface. In contrast, for disks that are closer to the source,
the PDR is thin and not resolved in our simulations. The IF then coincides with
the first grid points of the disk that are facing the ionizing photon source.
In both cases, the photoevaporated wind shocks (after the IF) with the wind
that comes from the ionizing source, and this interaction region is bright in
Ha. Our 3D models produce two emission features: a hemispherically shaped
structure (associated with the IF) and a detached bow shock where both winds
collide. A photodissociated region develops in all of the models exposed to the
FUV flux. More importantly, disks with different inclinations with respect to
the ionizating source have relatively similar photodissociation regions.

investigate the topology of statistical relationships between the fields of

investigate the terrestrial atmosphere's three-dimensional geopotential height

far only one parameterization (mathematical representation) for arbitrary

Gaussian white noise) of a system described by a master equation with $L$
Lindblad terms has been found [H. M. Wiseman and A. C. Doherty, Phys. Rev.

parameterizes diffusive unravellings by $L^2+2L$ real numbers, arranged in a

alternative parameterizations of diffusive measurements. We find, rather
surprisingly, the description of diffusive unravellings can be unified by a
single equation for a non-square complex matrix if one is willing to allow for
some redundancy by lifting the number of real parameters necessary from
$L^2+2L$ to $3L^2+L$. We call this parameterization the M-rep. Both the M-rep

quasi-simultaneous continuum images as an input to our SATIRE-S model and
calculate the TSI variation over cycle 23, sampled roughly twice-monthly. The
computed TSI is then compared to the PMOD composite of TSI measurements and to
the data from two individual instruments, SORCE/TIM and UARS/ACRIM II, that
monitored the TSI during the declining phase of cycle 23 and over the previous
minimum in 1996, respectively. Excellent agreement is found between the trends
shown by the model and almost all sets of measurements. The only exception is
the early, i.e. 1996 to 1998, PMOD data. Whereas the agreement between the
model and the PMOD composite over the period 1999-2009 is almost perfect, the
modelled TSI shows a steeper increase between 1996 and 1999 than implied by the
PMOD composite. On the other hand, the steeper trend in the model agrees
remarkably well with the ACRIM II data. A closer look at the VIRGO data, that
make the basis of the PMOD composite after 1996, reveals that only one of the
two VIRGO instruments, the PMO6V, shows the shallower trend present in the
composite, whereas the DIARAD measurements indicate a steeper trend. We
conclude that (1) the sensitivity changes of the PMO6V radiometers within VIRGO
during the first two years have very likely not been correctly evaluated, and
that (2) the TSI variations over cycle 23 and the change in the TSI levels
between the minima in 1996 and 2008 are consistent with the solar surface

dots generated by the driving of surface acoustic waves. Differing from static
quantum dots defined by a series of static electrodes above the two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG), here a single electron is captured from a 2DEG-reservoir
by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) and then trapped in a moving quantum dot (MQD)
transporting across a quasi-one dimensional channel (Q1DC), wherein all the
electrons have been excluded out by the actions of the surface gates. The
flying qubit introduced here is encoded by the two lowest adiabatic levels of
the electron in the MQD, and the Rabi oscillation between these two levels
could be implemented by applying finely-selected microwave pulses to the
surface gates. By using the Coulomb interaction between the electrons in
different moving quantum dots, we show that a desirable two-qubit operation,

Based on these bits, the reconstructor wishes to select a subset of $[0,T]$

pattern is produced by a homogeneous Poisson process of intensity $\lambda$,
and if the reconstructor is restricted to select a subset of average Lebesgue

that, as $T$ tends to infinity, any point pattern on $[0,T]$ containing no more

bits per second in this sense. Finally, a Wyner-Ziv version of this problem is
considered where some of the points in the pattern are known to the

detected in the light curve of V974 Oph obtained from ground-based
observations. The combination of radial and nonradial modes has a high
asteroseismic potential, thanks to the strong constraints we can put in the
modelling. The continuous monitoring of ASAS 192647-0030.0=CoRoT 101155310
(P=0.1258 d, V=13.4) ensured from space by the CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and
planetary Transits) mission constitutes a unique opportunity to exploit such
potential. The 22270 CoRoT measurements were performed in the chromatic mode.
They span 152 d and cover 1208 consecutive cycles. After the correction for one
jump and the long-term drift, the level of the noise turned out to be 29
micromag. The phase shifts and amplitude ratios of the coloured CoRoT data, the
HARPS spectra, and the period-luminosity relation were used to determine a
self-consistent physical model. In turn, it allowed us to model the oscillation
spectrum, also giving feedback on the internal structure of the star. In
addition to the fundamental radial mode f1=7.949 c/d with harmonics up to 10f1,
we detected 12 independent terms. Linear combinations were also found and the
light curve was solved by means of 61 frequencies (smallest amplitude 0.10
mmag). The newest result is the detection of a periodic modulation of the f1
mode (triplets at +/-0.193 c/d centred on f1 and 2f1), discussed as a
rotational effect or as an extension of the Blazhko effect to HADS stars. The
physical model suggests that CoRoT 101155310 is an evolved star, with a slight
subsolar metallic abundance, close to the terminal age main sequence. All the
12 additional terms are identified with mixed modes in the predicted overstable

the value of the thermal conductivity {\xi}. At large value of {\xi}, as in
instantaneous quenching, the system is frozen in entangled configurations at
high viscosity while consists of grains with well ordered lamellae at low

variability of the 10.8 hours SKR period at a 1% level over weeks to years
remains intriguing. While its short-term fluctuations (20-30 days) have been
related to the variations of the solar wind speed, its long-term fluctuations
(months to years) were proposed to be triggered by Enceladus mass-loading
and/or seasonal variations. This situation has become even more complicated
since the recent identification of two separated periods at 10.8h and 10.6h,
each varying with time, corresponding to SKR sources located in the southern
(S) and the northern (N) hemispheres, respectively. Here, six years of Cassini
continuous radio measurements are investigated, from 2004 (pre-equinox) to the
end of 2010 (post-equinox). From S and N SKR, radio periods and phase systems
are derived separately for each hemisphere and fluctuations of radio periods
are investigated at time scales of years to a few months. Then, the S phase is
used to demonstrate that the S SKR rotational modulation is consistent with an
intrinsically rotating phenomenon, in contrast with the early Voyager picture.

control the flow of surface plasmons on metal-dielectric interfaces. We study
in detail five different examples: a cylindrical cloak, a beam shifter, a
right-angle bend, a lens and a ground-plane cloak. First, we demonstrate that
only the modification of the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in
the dielectric side can lead to almost perfect functionalities for surface
plasmons. We also show that, thanks to the quasi two-dimensional character of
surface plasmons and its inherent polarization, the application of conformal
and quasiconformal mapping techniques allows the design of plasmonic devices in
which only the isotropic refractive index of the dielectric film needs to be
engineered.

temperature, in search of indications for the magnetically induced rho meson
condensation, as predicted recently by Chernodub. The holographic model used is
the Sakai-Sugimoto model with two flavours and a non-zero constituent quark
mass. We fix the free holographic parameters by matching them to the
phenomenological value for the constituent quark mass and the experimental
values for the pion decay constant and the rho meson mass, this in absence of a
magnetic field. In a first approximation, the Landau levels are recovered,
indeed indicating an instability of the QCD vacuum at a critical magnetic
field, eB_c ~ m_\rho^2, to a phase where rho mesons are condensed. We improve
on this result by also taking into account the holographic analogue of chiral
magnetic catalysis, numerically solving the mass eigenvalue equation for the
rho meson, which depends on eB both explicitly and implicitly through the
changed embedding of the flavour probe branes. This turns out to raise eB_c
with a few percents. As a byproduct of our analysis we find that the separation
between the chiral symmetry restoration temperature T_\chi(eB) and the
deconfinement temperature T_c is 3.2 percent at eB = 30 m_\pi^2 ~ 0.57 GeV^2.

$r_n$ grows at least quadratically as a function of n. Moreover they show that
the minimal volume of a variety of general type of dimension n is smaller than
$\frac{3^{n+1}}{(n-1)^{n}}$. In addition we prove that for every positive
rational number q there are smooth varieties of general type with volume q and

investigated in the literature. However, most authors essentially focus on an
i.i.d. setting. In the case of dependent data, the classical empirical
likelihood method cannot be directly applied on the data but rather on blocks
of consecutive data catching the dependence structure. Generalization of
empirical likelihood based on the construction of blocks of increasing
nonrandom length have been proposed for time series satisfying mixing
conditions. Following some recent developments in the bootstrap literature, we
propose a generalization for a large class of Markov chains, based on small
blocks of various lengths. Our approach makes use of the regenerative structure
of Markov chains, which allows us to construct blocks which are almost
independent (independent in the atomic case). We obtain the asymptotic validity
of the method for positive recurrent Markov chains and present some simulation
results.

  Society",,"10.5303/JKAS.2011.44.2.049",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We calculate the energy spectra of cosmic ray (CR) protons and electrons at a
plane shock with quasi-parallel magnetic fields, using time-dependent,
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) simulations, including energy losses via
synchrotron emission and Inverse Compton (IC) scattering. A thermal leakage
injection model and a Bohm type diffusion coefficient are adopted. The electron
spectrum at the shock becomes steady after the DSA energy gains balance the
synchrotron/IC losses, and it cuts off at the equilibrium momentum p_{eq}. In
the postshock region the cutoff momentum of the electron spectrum decreases
with the distance from the shock due to the energy losses and the thickness of
the spatial distribution of electrons scales as p^{-1}. Thus the slope of the
downstream integrated spectrum steepens by one power of p for p_{br}<p<p_{eq},
where the break momentum decrease with the shock age as p_{br}\propto t^{-1}.
In a CR modified shock, both the proton and electron spectrum exhibit a concave
curvature and deviate from the canonical test-particle power-law, and the
upstream integrated electron spectrum could dominate over the downstream
integrated spectrum near the cutoff momentum. Thus the spectral shape near the
cutoff of X-ray synchrotron emission could reveal a signature of nonlinear DSA.

embedded in a dielectric environment is calculated. It is shown that high-k
(higher than semiconductor dielectric constant) dielectric environment reduces
the screening by the free carriers inside the nanostructure whereas, low
dielectric environment increases the Coulombic interaction between free
carriers and enhances the strength of screening function. In long wavelength
limit, dielectric screening and collective excitation of electron gas are found
to be solely determined by the environment instead of the semiconductor.
Behavior of static dielectric function is particularly addressed at a specific

to the Simons cone ${\mathcal C} = \{(x^1,x^2) \in \mathbb{R}^m \times

uniqueness was only known when $2m=2$. On the other hand, they are known to be
unstable in dimensions 2, 4, and 6. Their stability in dimensions 8, 10, and 12
remains an open question. In addition, since the Simons cone minimizes area
when $2m \geq 8$, saddle-shaped solutions are expected to be global minimizers
when $2m \geq 8$, or at least in higher dimensions. This is a property stronger
than stability which is not yet established in any dimension.

174 settlements with 1000 inhabitants or more are expected to be affected. The
Mexican state with the largest area affected is Tabasco with more than 21% of
its territory, while the most vulnerable population will be Veracruz, with more
