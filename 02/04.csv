disseminate game events in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs).
Game events are disseminated through an overlay network. The proposed scheme
exploits the typical behavior of players to tune the data dissemination. In
fact, it is well known that users playing a MOG typically generate game events
at a rate that can be approximated using some (game dependent) probability
distribution. Hence, as soon as a given node experiences a reception rate, for
messages coming from a given peer, which is lower than expected, it can send a
stimulus to the neighbor that usually forwards these messages, asking it to
increase its dissemination probability. Three variants of this approach will be
studied. According to the first one, upon reception of a stimulus from a
neighbor, a peer increases its dissemination probability towards that node
irrespectively from the sender. In the second protocol a peer increases only
the dissemination probability for a given sender towards all its neighbors.
Finally, the third protocol takes into consideration both the sender and the
neighbor in order to decide how to increase the dissemination probability. We
performed extensive simulations to assess the efficacy of the proposed scheme,
and based on the simulation results we compare the different dissemination
protocols. The results confirm that adaptive gossip schemes are indeed
effective and deserve further investigation.

code designed to simulate astrophysical processes such as star and planet
formation. It is written in Fortran 95/2003 and has been parallelised using
OpenMP. SEREN is designed in a flexible, modular style, thereby allowing a
large number of options to be selected or disabled easily and without
compromising performance. SEREN uses the conservative `grad-h' formulation of
SPH, but can easily be configured to use traditional SPH or Godunov SPH.
Thermal physics is treated either with a barotropic equation of state, or by
solving the energy equation and modelling the transport of cooling radiation. A
Barnes-Hut tree is used to obtain neighbour lists and compute gravitational
accelerations efficiently, and an hierarchical time-stepping scheme is used to
reduce the number of computations per timestep. Dense gravitationally bound
objects are replaced by sink particles, to allow the simulation to be evolved
longer, and to facilitate the identification of protostars and the compilation
of stellar and binary properties. At the termination of a hydrodynamical
simulation, SEREN has the option of switching to a pure N-body simulation,
using a 4th-order Hermite integrator, and following the ballistic evolution of
the sink particles (e.g. to determine the final binary statistics once a star
cluster has relaxed). We describe in detail all the algorithms implemented in
SEREN and we present the results of a suite of tests designed to demonstrate
the fidelity of SEREN and its performance and scalability. Further information

simulations with remarkably weak shear viscosity, modeling QGP as an almost
perfect fluid, are in favor of the occurrence of a strongly-coupled QGP
expanding and cooling during the reaction. A derivation of these features in
QCD at strong coupling is still lacking and represents a very intricate
theoretical challenge. As a quite unique modern tool to relate these dynamical
features to a microscopic gauge field theory at strong coupling, time-dependent
realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence provide a fruitful way to study
these properties in a realistic kinematic configuration. Relating a
4-dimensional Yang-Mills gauge theory with four supersymmetries (which is a
conformal field theory, CFT) with gravity in Anti-de Sitter space in five
dimensions (AdS), the AdS/CFT correspondence provides a useful ""laboratory"" to
study yet unknown strong coupling properties of QCD. Besides the interest of
revealing new aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence in a dynamical set-up, the
application to plasma formation leads to non trivial theoretical properties, as
we will discuss in the lectures. The highlights of the present lectures are:
  1. Emergence of an (almost) perfect hydrodynamic fluid at late proper-times

assess their ability to provide such a link between chemistry and rheology. We
distinguish between two classes of coarse-graining levels, which we term
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and coarse-grained stochastic dynamics
(CGSD). In CGMD the coarse-grained beads are still relatively hard, thus
automatically preventing bond crossing. This also implies an upper limit on the
number of atoms that can be lumped together and therefore on the longest chain
lengths that can be studied. To reach a higher degree of coarse-graining, in
CGSD many more atoms are lumped together, leading to relatively soft beads. In
that case friction and stochastic forces dominate the interactions, and actions
must be undertaken to prevent bond crossing. We also review alternative methods
that make use of the tube model of polymer dynamics, by obtaining the
entanglement characteristics through a primitive path analysis and by
simulation of a primitive chain network. We finally review super-coarse-grained
methods in which an entire polymer is represented by a single particle, and
comment on ways to include memory effects and transient forces.

that muon asymmetries in high-p_T dijet events, with suitable use of muon and

energy range with unprecedented accuracy by the Fermi satellite. Understanding
this component is crucial as it provides a background to many different signals
such as extragalactic sources or annihilating dark matter. It is timely to
reinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties
which are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions. The Galactic
gamma-ray diffuse emission is mostly produced above a few GeV by the
interactions of cosmic ray primaries impinging on the interstellar material.
The theoretical error on that component is derived by exploring various
potential sources of uncertainty. Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray
propagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,
the Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution
can also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species
throughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone
diffusion/convection model. This allows to convert the constraints set by the
boron-to-carbon data into a theoretical uncertainty on the diffuse emission.
New deconvolutions of the HI and CO sky maps are also used to get the hydrogen
distribution within the Galaxy. The thickness of the cosmic ray diffusive halo
is found to have a significant effect on the Galactic gamma-ray diffuse
emission while the interplay between diffusion and convection has little
influence on the signal. The uncertainties related to nuclear cross sections
and to the primary cosmic ray fluxes at the Earth are significant. The radial
distribution of supernova remnants along the Galactic plane turns out to be a
key ingredient. As expected, the predictions are extremely sensitive to the
spatial distribution of hydrogen within the Milky Way.

space of Bo\.zjeko and Speicher, interpolate between the classical commutation
relations (CCR) and the classical anti-commutation relations (CAR) defined on
the classical bosonic and fermionic Fock spaces, respectively. Interpreting the
$q$-Fock space as an algebra of ""random variables"" exhibiting a specific
commutativity structure, one can construct the so-called $q$-semicircular and
$q$-circular operators acting as $q$-deformations of the classical Gaussian and
complex Gaussian random variables, respectively. While the $q$-semicircular
operator is generally well understood, many basic properties of the
$q$-circular operator (in particular, a tractable expression for its norm)
remain elusive. Inspired by the combinatorial approach to free probability, we
revist the combinatorial formulations of these operators. We point out that a
finite alternating-sum expression for $2n$-norm of the $q$-semicircular is
available via generating functions of chord-crossing diagrams developed by
Touchard in the 1950s and distilled by Riordan in 1974. Extending these norms
as a function in $q$ onto the complex unit ball and taking the $n\to\infty$
limit, we recover the familiar expression for the norm of the $q$-semicircular
and show that the convergence is uniform on the compact subsets of the unit
ball. In contrast, the $2n$-norms of the $q$-circular are encoded by
chord-crossing diagrams that are parity-reversing, which have not yet been
characterized in the combinatorial literature. We derive certain combinatorial
properties of these objects, including closed-form expressions for the number
of such diagrams of any size with up to eleven crossings. These properties
enable us to conclude that the $2n$-norms of the $q$-circular operator are
significantly less well behaved than those of the $q$-semicircular operator.

scattering amplitudes has been generalized to the multiparton case. It was
shown that the exponent of Wilson-line correlators is a sum of webs, where each
web is formed through mixing between the kinematic factors and colour factors
of a closed set of diagrams which are mutually related by permuting the gluon
attachments to the Wilson lines. In this paper we use replica trick methods, as
well as results from enumerative combinatorics, to prove that web mixing
matrices are always: (a) idempotent, thus acting as projection operators; and
(b) have zero sum rows: the elements in each row in these matrices sum up to
zero, thus removing components that are symmetric under permutation of gluon
attachments. Furthermore, in webs containing both planar and non-planar
diagrams we show that the zero sum property holds separately for these two
sets. The properties we establish here are completely general and form an
important step in elucidating the structure of exponentiation in non-Abelian
gauge theories.

  The intersection invariant is a higher-order generalization of the

give the linking number of the link on the boundary, which measures
intersections among the Whitney disks and the disks bounding the given link,
together with information that measures the twists (framing obstructions) of

  This interpretation of Milnor invariants as higher-order intersection
invariants plays a key role in the classifications of both the framed and

generalises Leith's model of a turbulent cascade to an arbitrary cascade having
a single conserved quantity. There are three stationary regimes depending on
whether the Kolmogorov exponent is greater than, less than or equal to the
equilibrium exponent. In the first regime, the large scale spectrum scales with
the Kolmogorov exponent. In the second regime, the large scale spectrum scales
with the equilibrium exponent so the system appears to be at equilibrium at
large scales. Furthermore, in this equilibrium-like regime, the amplitude of
the large-scale spectrum depends on the small scale cut-off. This is
interpreted as an analogue of cascade nonlocality. In the third regime, the
equilibrium spectrum acquires a logarithmic correction. An exact analysis of
the self-similar, non-stationary problem shows that time-evolving cascades have
direct analogues of these three regimes.

On the nanometer length-scale the organization of DNA as chromatin in the
chromosomes involves a coiling of DNA around the histone core of the
nucleosome. We suggest that the size of the nucleosome core particle is
dictated by the fulfillment of two criteria: One is optimizing the volume
fraction of the DNA double helix; this requirement for close-packing has its
root in optimizing atomic and molecular interactions. The other criterion being
that of having a zero strain-twist coupling; being a zero-twist structure is a
necessity when allowing for transient tensile stresses during the
reorganization of DNA, e.g., during the reposition, or sliding, of a nucleosome
along the DNA double helix. The mathematical model we apply is based on a
tubular description of double helices assuming hard walls. When the base-pairs
of the linker-DNA is included the estimate of the size of an ideal nucleosome
is in close agreement with the experimental numbers. Interestingly, the size of
the nucleosome is shown to be a consequence of intrinsic properties of the DNA
double helix.

reaching consequences for stellar evolution. Nitrogen surface abundances for a
large and homogeneous sample of massive B-type stars in the LMC were obtained
by the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars. This sample is the first covering a
broad range of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enough
sample of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis.
We use the sample to provide the first rigorous test of the theory of
rotational mixing in massive stars. We calculated a grid of stellar evolution
models, using the FLAMES sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixing
processes. We developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this grid
to simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages and rotational
velocity distributions consistent with those from the FLAMES sample. The
synthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in the
observed sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical results
and theoretical predictions. Our simulations reproduce the fraction of stars
without significant nitrogen enrichment. The predicted number of rapid rotators
with enhanced nitrogen is about twice as large as found observationally.
Furthermore, a group of stars consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched
objects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects can not
be reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. Additional physical
processes appear to be required to understand the population of massive
main-sequence stars from the FLAMES sample.We discuss the possible role of
binary stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. We find
that the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is unlikely
produced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down in close binary
systems

here the possibility of constraining the cosmological parameters by enforcing

complexity theory. Understanding the complexity of the intermediate case in
which the constraints are quantum but all local terms in the Hamiltonian
commute, is of importance for conceptual, physical and computational complexity
reasons. Bravyi and Vyalyi showed in 2003, using a clever application of the
representation theory of C*-algebras, that if the terms in the Hamiltonian are
all two-local, the problem is in NP, and the entanglement in the ground states
is local. The general case remained open since then. In this paper we extend
the results of Bravyi and Vyalyi beyond the two-local case, to the case of
three-qubit interactions. We then extend our results even further, and show
that NP verification is possible for three-wise interaction between qutrits as
well, as long as the interaction graph is embedded on a planar lattice, or more
generally, ""Nearly Euclidean"" (NE). The proofs imply that in all such systems,
the entanglement in the ground states is local. These extensions imply an
intriguing sharp transition phenomenon in commuting Hamiltonian systems:
3-local NE systems based on qubits and qutrits cannot be used to construct
Topological order, as their entanglement is local, whereas for higher
dimensional qudits, or for interactions of at least 4 qudits, Topological Order
is already possible, via Kitaev's Toric Code construction. We thus conclude
that Kitaev's Toric Code construction is optimal for deriving topological order
based on commuting Hamiltonians.

properties of such black hole systems, namely their spin and inclination. We
have focused on a model where an orbiting hot spot is embedded in an accretion
disk. A new method of searching for the time-lag between orthogonal
polarization channels is developed and applied to an ensemble of hot spot
models that samples a wide range of parameter space. We found that the hot spot
model predicts signatures in polarized light which are in the range to be
measured directly in the near future. However, our estimations are predicted
upon the assumption of a Keplerian velocity distribution inside the flow where
the dominant part of the magnetic field is toroidal. We also found that if the
right model of the accretion flow can be chosen for each source (e.g. on the
basis of magnetohydrodynamics simulations) then the black hole spin and
inclination can be constrained to a small two-dimensional area in the
spin-inclination space. The results of the application of the method to the
available near-infrared polarimetric data of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is
presented. It is shown that even with the currently available data the spin and
inclination of Sgr A* can be constrained. Next generations of near-infrared and

computed with two different criteria for convective boundary definition and
including different mixing prescriptions within and beyond the formal limits of

r01 and r10 defined by Roxburgh & Vorontsov (2003). These variables are almost
linear in the expected observable frequency range, and we show that their slope

convective core, and the amplitude of the sound-speed discontinuity at the core
boundary. By considering about 25 modes and an accuracy in the frequency
determinations as expected from the CoRoT and Kepler missions, the technique we

by contact angle saturation - a phenomenon that is still not well understood.
We propose a generalized approach for electrowetting that, among other results,
can shed new light on contact angle saturation. The model assumes the existence
of a minimum (with respect to the contact angle) in the electric energy and
accounts for a quadratic voltage dependence ~U^2 in the low-voltage limit,
compatible with the Young-Lippmann formula, and a ~1/U^2 saturation at the
high-voltage limit. Another prediction is the surprising possibility of a
reversed electrowetting regime, in which the contact angle increases with
applied voltage. By explicitly taking into account the effect of the
counter-electrode, our model is shown to be applicable to several AC and DC
experimental electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) setups. Several features seen
in experiments compare favorably with our results. Furthermore, the AC
frequency dependence of EWOD agrees quantitatively with our predictions. Our
numerical results are complemented with simple analytical expressions for the
saturation angle in two practical limits.

represent two classes of accreting black holes. They both contain an accretion
disc emitting a thermal radiation, and a non-thermal X-ray emitting corona.
GBHs exhibit state transitions, and their spectral states are characterized by
different luminosity levels and shapes of the spectral energy distribution
(SED). If AGN transitioned in a similar way, the characteristic timescales of
such transitions would exceed ~10^5 years. Thus, the probability to observe an
individual AGN transiting between different spectral states is very low. In
this paper we follow a spectral evolution of a GBH, GRO~J1655-40, and then
apply its SED evolution pattern to a simulated population of AGN under an
assumption that a large sample of AGN should contain a mixture of sources in
different spectral states. We model the X-ray spectra of GRO J1655-40 with the
eqpair model and then scale the best-fitting models with the black hole mass to
simulate the AGN spectra. We compare the simulated and observed AGN SEDs to
determine the spectral states of observed Type 1 AGN, LINER and NLS1
populations. We conclude that bright Type 1 AGN and NLS1 galaxies are in a
spectral state similar to the soft spectral state of GBHs, while the spectral
state of LINERs may correspond to the hard spectral state of GBHs. We find that
taking into account a spread in the black hole masses over several orders of
magnitude, as in the observed AGN samples, leads to a correlation between the
X-ray loudness and the monochromatic luminosity at 2500A, similar to that found
in observations. We predict however that the correlation changes its sign
around a critical luminosity of L_crit ~ 0.01 L_E.

scattering model, one can theoretically derive the limb-darkening parameters
from simultaneous measurements of visibilities at several different projected
baseline lengths to improve the size and shape determination to an accuracy of
a few percent. With a 3-D shape model for the dwarf planet Haumea, we
demonstrate that when photometric light curve, visibility light curve, and
visibility phase center displacement are combined, the rotational period and
sense of rotation can all be derived, and the rotational pole can be estimated.
Because of its elongated shape and the dark red spot, the rotation of Haumea
causes its optical photocenter to move in a loop on the sky, extending of ~80
\muas without the dark red spot, and ~200 \muas with it. Such movements are
easily detectable by space-based astrometric interferometer designed e.g. for

dominate the phonon contribution to resistivity in the absence of strain, where
a density independent mobility is obtained. This contribution is strongly

are studied in connection with scintillation. The focus is on small scales $L
\sim 10^8-10^{10}$ cm where the Kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) regime is active in
the interstellar medium. MHD turbulence converts to a KAW cascade, starting at
10 times the ion gyroradius and continuing to smaller scales. These scales are
inferred to dominate scintillation in the theory of Boldyrev et al. From
numerical solutions of a decaying kinetic Alfv\'en wave turbulence model,
structure morphology reveals two types of localized structures, filaments and
sheets, and shows that they arise in different regimes of resistive and
diffusive damping. Minimal resistive damping yields localized current filaments
that form out of Gaussian-distributed initial conditions. When resistive
damping is large relative to diffusive damping, sheet-like structures form. In
the filamentary regime, each filament is associated with a non-localized
magnetic and density structure, circularly symmetric in cross section. Density
and magnetic fields have Gaussian statistics (as inferred from Gaussian-valued
kurtosis) while density gradients are strongly non-Gaussian, more so than
current. This enhancement of non-Gaussian statistics in a derivative field is
expected since gradient operations enhance small-scale fluctuations. The
enhancement of density gradient kurtosis over current kurtosis is not obvious,
yet it suggests that modest fluctuation levels in electron density may yield
large scintillation events during pulsar signal propagation in the interstellar
medium. In the sheet regime the same statistical observations hold, despite the
absence of localized filamentary structures. Probability density functions are
constructed from statistical ensembles in both regimes, showing clear formation
of long, highly non-Gaussian tails.

helium line profiles formed in the accretion flows and the outflows near the
star-disk interaction regions of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). The
statistical equilibrium calculations, performed under the assumption of the
Sobolev approximation using the radiative transfer code TORUS, has been
improved to include He I and He II energy levels. This allows us to probe the
physical conditions of the inner wind of CTTSs by simultaneously modelling the
robust wind diagnostic line He I (10830) and the accretion diagnostic lines
such as Pa-beta, Br-gamma and He I (5876). The code has been tested in 1 and
2-D problems, and we have shown that the results are in agreement with
established codes. We apply the model to the complex flow geometries of CTTSs.
Example model profiles are computed using the combinations of (1)
magnetospheric accretion and disc wind, and (2) magnetospheric accretion and
the stellar wind. In both cases, the model produces line profiles which are
qualitatively similar to those found in observations. Our models are consistent
with the scenario in which the narrow blueshifted absorption component of He I
(10830) seen in observations is caused by a disc wind, and the wider
blueshifted absorption component (the P-Cygni profile) is caused by a bipolar
stellar wind. However, we do not have a strong constraint on the relative
importance of the wind and the magnetosphere for the `emission' component. Our
preliminary calculations suggest that the temperatures of the disc wind,
stellar wind and the magnetosphere cannot be much higher than ~10,000 K, on the
basis of the strengths of hydrogen lines. With these low temperatures, we find
that the photoionzation by high energy photons (e.g. X-rays) is necessary to

Equal Mass Planetesimals",,,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As to April 2010, 48 TNO (trans-Neptunian Object) binaries have been found.
This is about 6% of known TNOs. However, in previous theoretical studies of
planetary formation in the TNO region, the effect of binary formation has been
neglected. TNO binaries can be formed through a variety of mechanisms, such as
three-body process, dynamical friction on two massive bodies, inelastic
collisions between two bodies etc. Most of these mechanisms become more
effective as the distance from the Sun increases. In this paper, we studied
three-body process using direct N-body simulations. We systematically changed
the distance from the Sun, the number density of planetesimals, and the radius
of the planetesimals and studied the effect of the binaries on the collision
rate of planetesimals. In the TNO region, binaries are involved in 1/3 - 1/2 of
collisions, and the collision rate is increased by about a factor of a few
compared to the theoretical estimate for the direct two-body collisions. Thus,
it is possible that the binaries formed through three-body process
significantly enhance the collision rate and reduce the growth time scale. In
the terrestrial planet region, binaries are less important, because the ratio
between the Hill radius and physical size of the planetesimals is relatively
small. Although the time scale of our simulations is short, they clearly
demonstrated that the accretion process in the TNO region is quite different
from that in the terrestrial planet region. Simulations which cover longer time
scale are required to obtain more accurate estimate for the accretion
enhancement.

a principled Bayesian framework. We reparameterize the hybrid model in the

give a proof extended to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In addition, we
derive a general result about the locality properties of the effect of
perturbations of the dynamics for quantum systems with a quasi-local structure

gapped ground states in the same phase, satisfies a Lieb-Robinson bound. As a
result, we obtain that, in the thermodynamic limit, the spectral flow converges

found in literature represent beams of particles (e.g. protons). These
particles interact with the matter in the stellar wind of the companion star in
the system or with crossing clouds, generating gamma-rays via proton-proton
processes. Our aim is to derive the particle distribution in the jet as seen by
the observer, so that proper computation of the $\gamma$-ray and neutrino
yields can be done. We use relativistic invariants to obtain the transformed
expressions in the case of a power-law and power-law with a cutoff particle
distribution in the beam. We compare with previous expressions used earlier in
the literature. We show that formerly used expressions for the particle
distributions in the beam as seen by the observer are in error, differences
being strongly dependent on the viewing angle. For example, for $\Gamma =10$
($\Gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the blob) and angles larger than $\sim
20^o$, the earlier-used calculation entails an over-prediction (order of
magnitude or more) of the proton spectra for $E>\Gamma mc^2$, whereas it always
over-predicts (two orders of magnitude) the proton spectrum at lower energies,
disregarding the viewing angle. All the results for photon and neutrino fluxes
in hadronic models in beams that have made use of the earlier calculation are
affected. Given that correct gamma-ray fluxes will be in almost any case
significantly diminished in comparison with published results, and that the
time of observations in Cherenkov facilities grows with the square of the
flux-reduction factor in a statistically limited result, the possibility of
observing hadronic beams is undermined.

of 12C in the leading 12C + 12C reaction (C-detonation) may occur in the low
density outer layers of white dwarfs exploding as Type Ia supernovae (SNIa).
Previous studies of carbon-oxygen detonation structure and stability at low
densities were performed under the assumption that the ""velocity"" of a
detonation wave derives from complete burning of carbon and oxygen to iron. In
fact, at densities <10^6 g/cm3 the detonation in SNIa may release less than a
half of the available nuclear energy. In this paper we study basic properties
of such detonations. We find that the length of an unsupported steady-state
C-detonation is 30-100 times greater than previously estimated, and that the
decreased energy has a drastic effect on the detonation stability. In contrast
to complete detonations which are one-dimensionally stable, C-detonations may
be one-dimensionally unstable and propagate by periodically re-igniting
themselves via spontaneous burning. The re-ignition period at rho < 10^6 g/cm3
is estimated to be greater than the time-scale of a SNIa explosion. This
suggests that propagation and quenching of C-detonations at these densities
could be affected by the instability. Potential observational implications of
this effect are discussed.

parallel, any $k$-stacked polytopal sphere of dimension $d\geq 2k$ bounds a
unique and canonically defined $k$-stacked ball. We consider the class ${\cal
W}_k(d)$ of combinatorial $d$-manifolds with $k$-stellated links. For $d\geq
2k+2$, any member of ${\cal W}_k(d)$ bounds a unique and canonically defined
""$k$-stacked"" $(d+1)$-manifold.
  We introduce the mu-vector of simplicial complexes, and show that the
mu-vector of any 2-neighbourly simplicial complex dominates its vector of Betti
numbers componentwise, and the two vectors are equal precisely when the complex
is tight. When $d\geq 2k$, we are able to estimate/compute certain alternating
sums of the mu-numbers of any 2-neighbourly member of ${\cal W}_k(d)$. This
leads to a lower bound theorem for such triangulated manifolds. As an
application, it is shown that any $(k+1)$-neighbourly member of ${\cal W}_k(d)$
is tight, subject only to an extra condition on the $k^{th}$ Betti number in
case $d=2k+1$. This result more or less settles a recent conjecture of
Effenberger, and it also provides a uniform and conceptual tightness proof for
all the known tight triangulated manifolds, with only two exceptions. It is
shown that any polytopal upper bound sphere of odd dimension $2k+1$ belongs to
the class ${\cal W}_k(2k+1)$, thus generalizing a theorem due to Perles. This
shows that the case $d=2k+1$ is indeed exceptional for the tightness theorem.

non-rotating solar-type star, by performing 3D numerical simulations using a
Boussinesq-type model. These waves are excited at the top of the radiation zone
by the tidal forcing of a short-period planet on a circular, coplanar orbit.
This extends previous work done in 2D by Barker & Ogilvie. We first derive a
linear wave solution, which is not exact in 3D; however, the reflection of
ingoing waves from the centre is close to perfect for moderate amplitude waves.
Waves with sufficient amplitude to cause isentropic overturning break, and
deposit their angular momentum near the centre. This forms a critical layer, at
which the angular velocity of the flow matches the orbital angular frequency of
the planet. This efficiently absorbs ingoing waves, and spins up the star from
the inside out, while the planet spirals into the star. We also perform
numerical integrations to determine the linearised adiabatic tidal response
throughout the star, for solar-type stellar models with masses in the range 0.5
< m_star/M_sun < 1.1, throughout their main sequence lifetimes. The aim is to
study the launching region for these waves at the top of the radiation zone in
more detail, and to determine the accuracy of a semi-analytic approximation for
the tidal torque on the star, that was derived under the assumption that all
ingoing wave angular momentum is absorbed in a critical layer. The main
conclusions are that this nonlinear mechanism of tidal dissipation could
provide an explanation for the survival of all short-period extrasolar planets
observed around FGK stars, while it predicts the destruction of more massive
planets. This work provides further support for the model outlined in a
previous paper by Barker & Ogilvie, and makes predictions that will be tested
by ongoing observational studies, such as WASP and Kepler.

system based on kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) currently being developed
for millimeter wave astronomy. In a first technical run, NIKA was successfully
tested in 2009 at the Institute for Millimetric Radio Astronomy (IRAM) 30-meter
telescope at Pico Veleta, Spain. This prototype consisted of a 27-42 pixel
camera imaging at 150 GHz. Subsequently, an improved system has been developed
and tested in October 2010 at the Pico Veleta telescope. The instrument
upgrades included dual-band optics allowing simultaneous imaging at 150 GHz and
220 GHz, faster sampling electronics enabling synchronous measurement of up to
112 pixels per measurement band, improved single-pixel sensitivity, and the
fabrication of a sky simulator to replicate conditions present at the
telescope. Results. The new dual-band NIKA was successfully tested in October
2010, performing in-line with sky simulator predictions. Initially the sources
targeted during the 2009 run were re-imaged, verifying the improved system
performance. An optical NEP was then calculated to be around 2 \dot 10-16
W/Hz1/2. This improvement in comparison with the 2009 run verifies that NIKA is
approaching the target sensitivity for photon-noise limited ground-based
detectors. Taking advantage of the larger arrays and increased sensitivity, a
number of scientifically-relevant faint and extended objects were then imaged
including the Galactic Center SgrB2(FIR1), the radio galaxy Cygnus A and the
NGC1068 Seyfert galaxy. These targets were all observed simultaneously in the
150 GHz and 220 GHz atmospheric windows.

disordered two-chain cylindrical ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux $0 <
\phi <\phi_0/2$ (with $\phi_0$ the flux quantum) and described by the Anderson
model. The effect of the disorder reveals a strong reduction of the persistent
current for flux values near $\phi_0/4$.
  In conjunction with the pure system (zeroth order) current profile averaged
over numbers of electrons and earlier results for the effect of disorder in
one-dimensional rings, our two-channel results provide a simple interpretation
of salient features of numerical results of Bouchiat and Montambaux (BM) for
persistent current in an assembly of many-channel disordered rings.
Single-channel (one-dimensional) effects are responsible for the dip in the
persistent obtained by BM near $\phi=0$ and the corresponding peak near
$\phi_0/2$, while the effect of disorder in independent channel pairs accounts
for abrupt decreases of current superimposed to a continuous linear decay as
the flux value $\phi_0/4$ is approached from above and from below,
respectively. The persistent current in the two-channel ring involves a free
particle current averaged over electron numbers of periodicity $\phi_0/2$, and
a dominant disorder effect which has periodicity $\phi_0$.

possibilities of constructing the charged lepton mixing matrix and point out
that the {\it phases} of whose elements play a crucial role to satisfy the QLC

energy surface (PES) is employed and its effect on the dynamics is analyzed and
compared with previous calculations where an experimentally derived PES was
used [New J. Phys {\bf 11}, 055021 (2009)]. In contrast to the results using
the older PES, magnetic field dependence of the low-field-seeking state in the
ultracold regime is characterized by quite a large background scattering
length, $a_{bg}$, and, in addition, cross sections exhibit broad and pronounced
Feshbach resonances. The marked resonance structure is somewhat surprising
considering the influence of inelastic scattering, but it can be explained by
resorting to the analytical van der Waals theory, where the short range
amplitude of the entrance channel wave function is enhanced by the large
$a_{bg}$. This strong sensitivity to the short range of the {\em ab initio} PES
persists up to relatively high energies (10 mK). After this study and despite
quantitative predictions are very difficult, it can be concluded that the ratio
between elastic and spin relaxation scattering is generally small, except for
magnetic fields which are either low or close to an asymmetric Fano-type
resonance. Some general trends found here, such as a large density of
quasibound states and a propensity towards large scattering lengths, could be
also characteristic of other anisotropic molecule-molecule systems.

actions is a skill only performed by humans and animals. The intelligence of
current computer algorithms has not reached this level of complexity, but there
are several research efforts that are working towards it. With the number of
classification algorithms available, it is hard to determine which algorithm
works best for a particular situation. In classification of visual human intent
data, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and their variants, are leading candidates.
  The inability of HMMs to provide a probability in the observation to
observation linkages is a big downfall in this classification technique. If a
person is visually identifying an action of another person, they monitor
patterns in the observations. By estimating the next observation, people have
the ability to summarize the actions, and thus determine, with pretty good
accuracy, the intention of the person performing the action. These visual cues
and linkages are important in creating intelligent algorithms for determining
human actions based on visual observations.
  The Evidence Feed Forward Hidden Markov Model is a newly developed algorithm
which provides observation to observation linkages. The following research
addresses the theory behind Evidence Feed Forward HMMs, provides mathematical
proofs of their learning of these parameters to optimize the likelihood of
observations with a Evidence Feed Forwards HMM, which is important in all
computational intelligence algorithm, and gives comparative examples with
standard HMMs in classification of both visual action data and measurement
data; thus providing a strong base for Evidence Feed Forward HMMs in
classification of many types of problems.

problem is represented by Extended Theories of Gravity. Should this be indeed
the case, there will be an impact not only on cosmological scales, but also at
any scale, from the Solar System to extragalactic ones. In particular, the
gravitational potential can be different from the Newtonian one commonly
adopted when computing the circular velocity fitted to spiral galaxies rotation
curves. Phenomenologically modelling the modified point mass potential as the
sum of a Newtonian and a Yukawa like correction, we simulate observed rotation
curves for a spiral galaxy described as the sum of an exponential disc and a
NFW dark matter halo. We then fit these curves assuming parameterized halo
models (either with an inner cusp or a core) and using the Newtonian potential
to estimate the theoretical rotation curve. Such a study allows us to
investigate the bias on the disc and halo model parameters induced by the
systematic error induced by forcing the gravity theory to be Newtonian when it
is not. As a general result, we find that both the halo scale length and virial
mass are significantly overestimated, while the dark matter mass fraction
within the disc optical radius is typically underestimated. Moreover, should
the Yukawa scale length be smaller than the disc half mass radius, then the
logarithmic slope of the halo density profile would turn out to be shallower
than the NFW one. Finally, cored models are able to fit quite well the
simulated rotation curves, provided the disc mass is biased high in agreement
with the results in literature, favoring cored haloes and maximal discs. Such
results make us argue that the cusp/core controversy could actually be the
outcome of an incorrect assumption about which theory of gravity must actually
be used in computing the theoretical circular velocity.

extensively studied problems in social networks. Various models and algorithms
have been proposed in the literature in the context of the influence
maximization problem. A crucial assumption in all these studies is that the
influence probabilities are known to the social planner. This assumption is
unrealistic since the influence probabilities are usually private information
of the individual agents and strategic agents may not reveal them truthfully.
Moreover, the influence probabilities could vary significantly with the type of
the information flowing in the network and the time at which the information is
propagating in the network. In this paper, we use a mechanism design approach
to elicit influence probabilities truthfully from the agents. We first work
with a simple model, the influencer model, where we assume that each user knows
the level of influence she has on her neighbors but this is private
information. In the second model, the influencer-influencee model, which is
more realistic, we determine influence probabilities by combining the
probability values reported by the influencers and influencees. In the context
of the first model, we present how VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanisms could
be used for truthfully eliciting the influence probabilities. Our main
contribution is to design a scoring rule based mechanism in the context of the
influencer-influencee model. In particular, we show the incentive compatibility
of the mechanisms when the scoring rules are proper and propose a reverse
weighted scoring rule based mechanism as an appropriate mechanism to use. We
also discuss briefly the implementation of such a mechanism in viral marketing
applications.

operators that approximately fit the tentative singular vectors in a collective
and self-learning manner, using multiplicative update formulas. In the second,
additive phase (solve phase), the tentative singular triplets are improved up
to the desired accuracy by using an additive correction scheme with fixed

of the singular value decomposition is formulated that applies to the coarse
levels of the multilevel cycles. The proposed algorithm combines and extends
two existing multigrid approaches for symmetric positive definite eigenvalue
problems to the case of dominant and minimal singular triplets. Numerical tests
on model problems from different areas show that the algorithm converges to
high accuracy in a modest number of iterations, and is flexible enough to deal
with a variety of problems due to its self-learning properties.

Di-hadron azimuthal correlations provide sensitivity to the low longitudinal

Initial state nonlinear effects are in fact expected to appear in d+Au

We do this in two steps. First, we determine the T-duality representations of

the conjugacy classes. As a by-product we show how by a straightforward
procedure all solitonic fields of maximal supergravity are derived using the

endowed. Not only does it determine the conformal spacetime geometry when the
spacetime dimension n >2, as shown by Malament and Hawking-King-McCarthy
(MHKM), but also the manifold dimension. The MHKM result, however, applies more
generally to spacetimes satisfying the weaker causality condition of future and
past distinguishability (FPD), and it is an important question whether the
causal structure of such spacetimes can determine the manifold dimension. In
this work we show that the answer to this question is in the affirmative. We
investigate the properties of future or past distinguishing spacetimes and show
that their causal structures determine the manifold dimension. This gives a
non-trivial generalisation of the MHKM theorem and suggests that there is a
causal topology for FPD spacetimes which encodes manifold dimension and which
is strictly finer than the Alexandrov topology. We show that such a causal
topology does exist. We construct it using a convergence criterion based on
sequences of ""chain-intervals"" which are the causal analogs of null geodesic
segments. We show that when the region of strong causality violation satisfies
a local achronality condition, this topology is equivalent to the manifold
topology in an FPD spacetime.
