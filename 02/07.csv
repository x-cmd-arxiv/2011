of a type II core-collapse supernova (SN) 2008gz, which occurred in a star
forming arm and within a half-light radius (solar metallicity region) of a
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3672. The SN event was detected late and a detailed
investigation of its light curves and spectra spanning 200 days suggest that it
is an event of type IIP similar to archetypal SNe 2004et and 1999em. However,
in contrast to other events of its class, the SN 2008gz exhibits rarely
observed V magnitude drop of 1.5 over the period of a month during plateau to
nebular phase. Using 0.21 mag of Av as a lower limit and a distance of 25.5
Mpc, we estimate synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.05 \pm 0.01 M* and a
mid-plateau Mv of -16.6 \pm 0.2 mag. The photospheric velocity is observed to
be higher than that was observed for SN 2004et at similar epochs, indicating
explosion energy was comparable to or higher than SN 2004et. Similar trend was
also seen for the expansion velocity of H-envelopes. By comparing its
properties with other well studied events as well as by using a recent
simulation of pre-SN models of Dessart, Livne & Waldman (2010), we infer an
explosion energy range of 2 - 3 x 10$^{51}$ erg and this coupled with the
observed width of the forbidden [O I] 6300-6364 {\AA} line at 275 days after
the explosion gives an upper limit for the main-sequence (non-rotating, solar
metallicity) progenitor mass of 17 M*. Our narrow-band H{\alpha} observation,
taken nearly 560 days after the explosion and the presence of an emission kink
at zero velocity in the Doppler corrected spectra of SN indicate that the event
took place in a low luminosity star forming H II region.

that each encoder strictly-causally receives and learns the other encoder's
transmitted symbols and tries to cooperate with the other encoder by
transmitting its message. Next, we study this channel in a special case; we
assume that the common part of both states is known at both, hence encoders use
this opportunity to get better rate region. For these scenarios, an achievable
rate region is derived based on a combination of block-Markov encoding and
Gel'fand-Pinsker coding techniques. Furthermore, the achievable rate region is
established for the Gaussian channel, and it is shown that the capacity region
is achieved in certain circumstances.

radial) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) significantly
changes with the heliocentric distance, which poorly corresponds to classical
models of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) expansion.
For example, distributions of the radial photospheric and the source surface's
magnetic field in the ecliptic plane are Gaussian-like, the distribution of the
radial IMF component at the Earth orbit demonstrates two-humped shape, and it
becomes again Gaussian-like at 3-4 AU. These differences lead to lack of
correspondence between simulations of the IMF behaviour at 1 AU and
observations. Our results indicate that picture of the IMF expansion into space
is more complicated than usually considered, and the sector structure is not
the only source of the two-humped shape of the in-ecliptic or radial IMF
component. We have analysed data from different spacecraft at the distances
from 0.29 AU to 4 AU and found that the shape of the radial IMF component
distribution strongly depends on a heliocentric distance and a heliolatitude.
The ""two-humped IMF"" effect is most brightly expressed at low heliolatitudes at
0.7-2 AU, but it fully disappears at 3-4 AU. There is also dependence of the
IMF distributions' view on a solar cycle due to active processes, such as solar
flares and CMEs. We suppose that the in-ecliptic solar wind field at 1 AU is
influenced by solar active regions in a high degree, and actually the
distribution is the three-humped: two humps correspond to the IMF from the
middle and high heliolatitudes and the third one is the theoretically expected
distribution from the solar field nearby the heliomagnetic equator. Vanishing
of the IMF zero-component with the distance from the Sun partially could be a
result of a magnetic reconnection at the current sheets in the solar wind.

innovative scientific product to meet the request of information about the
phenomenology of the DM mystery at galactic scale. This Review concerns the
mass discrepancy phenomenon detected in galaxies, usually accounted by
postulating the presence of a non luminous non baryonic component. In the
theoretical framework of Newtonian Gravity we recall the properties of Dark
Matter halos as emerging from the state-of-the-art of numerical simulations
performed in the current $\Lambda CDM$ scenario. Then, the simple but
much-telling phenomenology of the distribution of dark and luminous matter in
Spirals, Ellipticals, and dwarf Spheroidals is reported. We show that a
coherent observational framework emerges from reliable data of different large
samples of objects and it is obtained by different methods of investigation. We
then highlight the impressive evidence that the distribution of dark and
luminous matter are closely correlated and that have universal features. Hints
on the cosmological role of this phenomenological scenario are then given.
Finally, we discuss the constraints on the elusive nature of the dark particle
that the actual distribution of DM around galaxies pose on its direct and
indirect searches.

According to our experiment, the answer is no for the Eulerian second-order

loudspeaker-driven jets pointed toward the centre of a spherical chamber. We
generated anisotropy by controlling the strengths of the jets. We found that
the form of the anisotropy of the velocity fluctuations was the same as that in
the strength of the jets. We then varied the anisotropy, as measured by the
ratio of axial to radial root-mean-square (RMS) velocity fluctuations, between
0.6 and 2.3. The Reynolds number was approximately constant at around
$R_\lambda$ = 481. In a central volume with a radius of 50 mm, the turbulence
was approximately homogeneous, axisymmetric, and had no shear and no mean flow.
We observed that the scaling exponent of the structure function was $0.70 \pm
0.03$, independent of the anisotropy and regardless of the direction in which
we measured it. The Kolmogorov constant, $C_2$, was also independent of
direction and anisotropy to within the experimental error of 4%.

study the following two rather basic problems on sphere packings. Recall that
the contact graph of an arbitrary finite packing of unit balls (i.e., of an
arbitrary finite family of non-overlapping unit balls) in Euclidean 3-space is
the (simple) graph whose vertices correspond to the packing elements and whose
two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements
touch each other. One of the most basic questions on contact graphs is to find
the maximum number of edges that a contact graph of a packing of n unit balls
can have in Euclidean 3-space. Our method for finding lower and upper estimates
for the largest contact numbers is a combination of analytic and combinatorial
ideas and it is also based on some recent results on sphere packings. Finally,
we are interested also in the following more special version of the above
problem. Namely, let us imagine that we are given a lattice unit sphere packing
with the center points forming the lattice L in Euclidean 3-space (and with
certain pairs of unit balls touching each other) and then let us generate
packings of n unit balls such that each and every center of the n unit balls is
chosen from L. Just as in the general case we are interested in finding good
estimates for the largest contact number of the packings of n unit balls
obtained in this way.

solution concentrates onto the two wells, resulting into a limiting system that

use of the linearity, nor of the fact that it is a second-order system. The
first key step in this approach is a reformulation of the equation as the
minimization of an action functional that captures the property of being a
curve of maximal slope in an integrated form. The second important step is a
rescaling of space. Using only the Wasserstein gradient-flow structure, we
prove that the sequence of rescaled solutions is pre-compact in an appropriate
topology. We then prove a Gamma-convergence result for the functional in this

correlations in high dimensional data in which there can be many fewer samples
than variables. We focus on threshold-based correlation screening methods for
three related applications: screening for variables with large correlations
within a single treatment (autocorrelation screening); screening for variables
with large cross-correlations over two treatments (cross-correlation
screening); screening for variables that have persistently large
auto-correlations over two treatments (persistent-correlation screening). The
novelty of correlation screening is that it identifies a smaller number of
variables which are highly correlated with others, as compared to identifying a
number of correlation parameters. Correlation screening suffers from a phase
transition phenomenon: as the correlation threshold decreases the number of
discoveries increases abruptly. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the mean
number of discoveries and the phase transition thresholds as a function of the
number of samples, the number of variables, and the joint sample distribution.
We also show that under a weak dependency condition the number of discoveries
is dominated by a Poisson random variable giving an asymptotic expression for
the false positive rate. The correlation screening approach bears tremendous
dividends in terms of the type and strength of the asymptotic results that can
be obtained. It also overcomes some of the major hurdles faced by existing
methods in the literature as correlation screening is naturally scalable to
high dimension. Numerical results strongly validate the theory that is
presented in this paper. We illustrate the application of the correlation
screening methodology on a large scale gene-expression dataset, revealing a few
influential variables that exhibit a significant amount of correlation over
multiple treatments.

of large-scale inhomogeneous magnetic structures by means of Large-Eddy
Simulation (LES) for convection in solar-type stars. The main idea of this
study is the implementation of a new subgrid-scale model for the effective
Lorentz force in a three-dimensional nonlinear radiative magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) code developed for simulating the upper solar convection zone and lower
atmosphere. To this end we derived the energy budget equations, which include
the effects of the subgrid-scale turbulence on the Lorentz-force, and
implemented the new subgrid-scale turbulence model (TELF-Model) in a
three-dimensional nonlinear MHD LES code. Using imposed initial vertical and
horizontal uniform magnetic fields in LES with the TELF-Model, we have shown
that the magnetic flux tubes formation is started when the initial mean
magnetic field is larger than a threshold value (about 100 G). This is in
agreement with the theoretical studies by Rogachevskii and Kleeorin (2007). We
have determined the vertical profiles of the velocity and magnetic
fluctuations, total MHD energy and anisotropy of turbulent magneto-convection,
kinetic and current and cross helicities.

Williams in \emph{Communication complexity with synchronized clocks}, CCC '10,
is a communication model which allows the participants to share a common clock.
The main open problem posed in this paper was the following: does the
synchronized bit model allow a logarithmic speed-up for all functions over the
standard deterministic model of communication? We resolve this question in the
negative by showing that the Median function, whose communication complexity is
$O(\log n)$, does not admit polytime synchronized bit protocol with
communication complexity $O\left(\log^{1-\epsilon} n\right)$ for any $\epsilon

the lithiation potentials are above the solid electrolyte interface (SEI)
formation threshold, but with capacities comparable to, or larger than
graphite. We observe that in highly oxidized and mildly reduced sheets,
lithiation occurs through the formation of Li-O bonds, whereas at low coverages
that are typical of reduced-GO (rGO) (O:C - 12.5 %), both Li-O bonds and LiC6
configurations are observed. The covalent Li-O bond is much stronger than the
bonds formed in the LiC6 ring and the lithiation potentials for epoxides at
high and medium coverages are generally large (> 1 eV). For these
congifurations, as in the case of Li4Ti5O12 anodes, there will be no formation
of SEI, but with the additional advantage of having higher lithium storage
capacity than Li4Ti5O12. In reduced GO sheets, the presence of residual oxygen
atoms allows for formation of covalent Li-O bonds that lead to storage
capacities and lithiation potentials higher than that of graphite. Finally, our
calculations show high lithiation potentials for the edges of graphene
nanoribbons, which will impede the formation of SEI and hence lead to large
reversible capacity.

challenges in next-generation networks such as providing flexible, adaptive,
and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to the
service providers. Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point
(AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are
required to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to
the wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that
do not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are
connected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to
conventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other
networks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for
WMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks
(MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols
for WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all
assumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does
not hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in
WMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks. First,
it identifies security vulnerabilities in the medium access control (MAC) and
the network layers. Various possibilities of compromising data confidentiality,
data integrity, replay attacks and offline cryptanalysis are also discussed.
Then various types of attacks in the MAC and the network layers are discussed.
After enumerating the various types of attacks on the MAC and the network

\bullet} x^{\star} + e^{\star}$, where $A_{\Omega \bullet}$ is a submatrix
whose rows are selected uniformly at random from rows of an orthogonal matrix
$A$ and $e^{\star}$ is an unknown sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may
be unbounded, we show that with high probability $\ell_1$-minimization can
recover the sparse signal of interest $x^{\star}$ exactly from only $m = C
\mu^2 k (\log n)^2$ where $k$ is the number of nonzero components of
$x^{\star}$ and $\mu = n \max_{ij} A_{ij}^2$, even if nearly 100% of the
measurements are corrupted. We further guarantee that stable recovery is
possible when measurements are polluted by both gross sparse and small dense
errors: $y = A_{\Omega \bullet} x^{\star} + e^{\star}+ \nu$ where $\nu$ is the
small dense noise with bounded energy. Numerous simulation results under
various settings are also presented to verify the validity of the theory as
well as to illustrate the promising potential of the proposed framework.

understanding of galactic compact objects like binary black hole systems and

and Gamma Ray Bursts. Furthermore, several particle astrophysics topics can be
addressed including uniquely sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance. In the
energy range from 10 keV to several MeV, Compton polarimeters achieve the best
performance. In this paper we evaluate the benefit that comes from using the
azimuthal and polar angles of the Compton scattered photons in the analysis,
rather than using the azimuthal scattering angles alone. We study the case of
an ideal Compton polarimeter and show that a Maximum Likelihood analysis which
uses the two scattering angles lowers the Minimum Detectable Polarization (MDP)
by ~20% compared to a standard analysis based on the azimuthal scattering
angles alone. The accuracies with which the polarization fraction and the
polarization direction can be measured improve by a similar amount. We conclude
by discussing potential applications of Maximum Likelihood analysis methods for
various polarimeter experiments.

10^{17}Mx to 10^{19}Mx. Emergence and cancellation are much less frequent than
merging and splitting. The time scale for splitting is found to be ~33 minutes
and is independent of the flux contained in the splitting patch. Moreover
magnetic patches split into any flux contents with an equal probability. It is
shown that such a fragmentation process leads to a distribution with a
power-law index -2. Merging has a very weak dependence on flux content only
with a power-law index -0.33. These results suggest that 1) magnetic patches
are fragmented by splitting, merging, and tiny cancellation; 2) flux is removed
from the photosphere through tiny cancellations after these fragmentations.

modulation of the nonlinearity, which may be implemented by means of the

which is repulsive or attractive on the average are considered. In the former
case, the main effect produced by the application of the FRM is spontaneous
self-trapping of the condensate in either of the two potential wells in
parameter regimes where it would remain untrapped in the absence of the
management. In the weakly nonlinear regime, the frequency of intrinsic
oscillations in the FRM-induced trapped state is very close to half the FRM
frequency, suggesting that the effect is accounted for by a parametric
resonance. In the case of the attractive nonlinearity, the FRM-induced effect
is the opposite, i.e., enforced detrapping of a state which is self-trapped in
its unmanaged form. In the latter case, the frequency of oscillations of the
untrapped mode is close to a quarter of the driving frequency, suggesting that
a higher-order parametric resonance may account for this effect.

concerned contains the highest concentration of IRAS/Spitzer sources, H I

present the first detailed study of the compact H II region N33 in the SMC by
placing it in a wider context of massive star formation. Moreover, we show that
N33 is a particularly interesting candidate for isolated massive star
formation. This analysis is based mainly on optical ESO NTT observations, both
imaging and spectroscopy, coupled with other archive data, notably Spitzer
images (IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mic) and 2MASS observations. We derive a
number of physical characteristics of the compact H II region N33 for the first
time. This gas and dust formation of 7"".4 (2.2 pc) in diameter is powered by a
massive star of spectral type O6.5-O7 V. The compact H II region belongs to a
rare class of H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds, called high-excitation
blobs (HEBs). We show that this H II region is not related to any star cluster.
Specifically, we do not find any traces of clustering around N33 on scales
larger than 10"" (~ 3 pc). On smaller scales, there is a marginal stellar
concentration, the low density of which, below the 3 sigma level, does not
classify it as a real cluster. We also verify that N33 is not a member of any
large stellar association. Under these circumstances, N33 is also therefore
attractive because it represents a remarkable case of isolated massive-star
formation in the SMC. Various aspects of the relevance of N33 to the topic of
massive-star formation in isolation are discussed.

the introduced SD complexity exponent manages to concisely describe the
computational reserves required by the SD algorithm to achieve arbitrarily
close to optimal decoding performance. Bounds and exact expressions for the SD
complexity exponent are obtained for the decoding of large families of codes

exponent is shown to take a particularly concise form as a non-monotonic

describes the minimum known complexity of any decoder that can provably achieve
a gap to maximum likelihood (ML) performance which vanishes in the high SNR
limit.

configurations of dynamic objects (swarm elements) whose motions exhibit local
spatiotemporal interdependency and stationarity, i.e., the motions are similar
in any small spatiotemporal neighborhood. Examples of DS abound in nature,
e.g., herds of animals and flocks of birds. To capture the local spatiotemporal
properties of the DS, we present a probabilistic model that learns both the
spatial layout of swarm elements and their joint dynamics that are modeled as
linear transformations. To this end, a spatiotemporal neighborhood is
associated with each swarm element, in which local stationarity is enforced
both spatially and temporally. We assume that the prior on the swarm dynamics
is distributed according to an MRF in both space and time. Embedding this model
in a MAP framework, we iterate between learning the spatial layout of the swarm
and its dynamics. We learn the swarm transformations using ICM, which iterates
between estimating these transformations and updating their distribution in the
spatiotemporal neighborhoods. We demonstrate the validity of our method by
conducting experiments on real video sequences. Real sequences of birds, geese,

of the multilayer. On the basis of obtained results, a mechanism leading to

the large-scale magnetic field resulting from the CR-driven dynamo is

shock waves provided the upstream (unshocked) plasma is weakly magnetized. At
low magnetization, the large size of the shock precursor indeed provides enough
time for electromagnetic micro-instabilities to grow and such
micro-instabilities generate small scale turbulence that in turn provides the
scattering required. The present paper extends our previous analysis on the
development of these micro-instabilities to account for the finite angular
dispersion of the beam of reflected and accelerated particles and to account
for the expected heating of the upstream electrons in the shock precursor. We
show that the oblique two stream instability may operate down to values of the
shock Lorentz factor gamma_{sh}~10 as long as the electrons of the upstream
plasma remain cold, while the filamentation instability is strongly inhibited
in this limit; however, as electrons get heated to relativistic temperatures,
the situation becomes opposite and the two stream instability becomes inhibited
while the filamentation mode becomes efficient, even at moderate values of the
shock Lorentz factor. The peak wavelength of these instabilities migrates from
the inertial electron scale towards the proton inertial scale as the background
electrons get progressively heated during the crossing of the shock precursor.
We also discuss the role of current driven instabilities upstream of the shock.
In particular, we show that the returning/accelerated particles give rise to a
transverse current through their rotation in the background magnetic field. We
find that the compensating current in the background plasma can lead to a
Buneman instability which provides an efficient source of electron heating.

re-examination of the basic interfaces used for mathematical formalization in
type theory. We present a new set of type classes for mathematics and take full
advantage of their unique features to make practical a particularly flexible
approach formerly thought infeasible. Thus, we address both traditional proof
engineering challenges as well as new ones resulting from our ambition to build
upon this development a library of constructive analysis in which abstraction
penalties inhibiting efficient computation are reduced to a minimum.
  The base of our development consists of type classes representing a standard
algebraic hierarchy, as well as portions of category theory and universal
algebra. On this foundation we build a set of mathematically sound abstract
interfaces for different kinds of numbers, succinctly expressed using
categorical language and universal algebra constructions. Strategic use of type
classes lets us support these high-level theory-friendly definitions while
still enabling efficient implementations unhindered by gratuitous indirection,
conversion or projection.
  Algebra thrives on the interplay between syntax and semantics. The
Prolog-like abilities of type class instance resolution allow us to
conveniently define a quote function, thus facilitating the use of reflective
techniques.

Laboratory (LNGS) was determined based on a detailed geological, geochemical
and geophysical study of the region. U and Th abundances of more than 50
samples representative of the main lithotypes belonging to the Mesozoic and
Cenozoic sedimentary cover were analyzed. Sedimentary rocks were grouped into
four main ""Reservoirs"" based on similar paleogeographic conditions and
mineralogy. Basement rocks do not outcrop in the area. Thus U and Th in the
Upper and Lower Crust of Valsugana and Ivrea-Verbano areas were analyzed. Based
on geological and geophysical properties, relative abundances of the various
reservoirs were calculated and used to obtain the weighted U and Th abundances
for each of the three geological layers (Sedimentary Cover, Upper and Lower
Crust). Using the available seismic profile as well as the stratigraphic
records from a number of exploration wells, a 3D modelling was developed over
an area of 2^{\circ}x2^{\circ} down to the Moho depth, for a total volume of
about 1.2x10^6 km^3. This model allowed us to determine the volume of the
various geological layers and eventually integrate the Th and U contents of the
whole crust beneath LNGS. On this base the local contribution to the
geo-neutrino flux (S) was calculated and added to the contribution given by the
rest of the world, yielding a Refined Reference Model prediction for the
geo-neutrino signal in the Borexino detector at LNGS: S(U) = (28.7 \pm 3.9) TNU
and S(Th) = (7.5 \pm 1.0) TNU. An excess over the total flux of about 4 TNU was
previously obtained by Mantovani et al. (2004) who calculated, based on general
worldwide assumptions, a signal of 40.5 TNU. The considerable thickness of the
sedimentary rocks, almost predominantly represented by U- and Th- poor
carbonatic rocks in the area near LNGS, is responsible for this difference.

examine the spectral index distribution in the source. We find (as previously
reported from the analysis of a single earlier image) that the profiles of the

taken into account. The sequence of five images allows us to disentangle the

power originating at the core. We find that the brightness of each piece of the
jet fades as an exponential function of age (or distance from the core),
exp(-tau/tau'), where tau is the age at emission and tau' = 55.9 +- 1.7 days.
This evolutionary model describes both the east and west jets equally well.
There is also significant variation (by a factor of at least five) in jet power
with birth epoch, with the east and west jets varying in synchrony. The lack of
deceleration between the scale of the optical Balmer line emission (10^15 cm)

September 11), and 2008 (Subprime Mortgage Crisis), which mark some of the
largest downturns of financial markets in the last three decades.

The model includes in particular the classical model on the system of all
subsets of a finite set. The general model associates canonical non-negative
and positively homogeneous superadditive functionals with generalized belief
functions relative to an ordered system, which are then extended to arbitrary
valuations on the set system. It is shown that the general Choquet integral can
be computed by a simple Monge-type algorithm for so-called intersection
systems, which include as a special case weakly union-closed families.
Generalizing Lov\'asz' classical characterization, we give a characterization
of the superadditivity of the Choquet integral relative to a capacity on a
union-closed system in terms of an appropriate model of supermodularity of such
capacities.

"1102.1341","Michel Grabisch","Michel Grabisch","Ensuring the boundedness of the core of games with restricted
  cooperation",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The core of a cooperative game on a set of players $N$ is one of the most
popular concept of solution. When cooperation is restricted (feasible
coalitions form a subcollection $\cF$ of $2^N$), the core may become unbounded,
which makes it usage questionable in practice. Our proposal is to make the core
bounded by turning some of the inequalities defining the core into equalities
(additional efficiency constraints). We address the following mathematical
problem: can we find a minimal set of inequalities in the core such that, if
turned into equalities, the core becomes bounded? The new core obtained is
called the restricted core. We completely solve the question when $\cF$ is a
distributive lattice, introducing also the notion of restricted Weber set. We
show that the case of regular set systems amounts more or less to the case of
distributive lattices. We also study the case of weakly union-closed systems
and give some results for the general case.

"1102.1342","Michel Grabisch","Michel Grabisch and Tong li","On the set of imputations induced by the k-additive core",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An extension to the classical notion of core is the notion of $k$-additive
core, that is, the set of $k$-additive games which dominate a given game, where
a $k$-additive game has its M\""obius transform (or Harsanyi dividends)
vanishing for subsets of more than $k$ elements. Therefore, the 1-additive core
coincides with the classical core. The advantages of the $k$-additive core is
that it is never empty once $k\geq 2$, and that it preserves the idea of
coalitional rationality. However, it produces $k$-imputations, that is,
imputations on individuals and coalitions of at most $k$ inidividuals, instead
of a classical imputation. Therefore one needs to derive a classical imputation
from a $k$-order imputation by a so-called sharing rule. The paper investigates
what set of imputations the $k$-additive core can produce from a given sharing
rule.

of WRF-Fire. WRF-Fire consists of a fire-spread model, implemented by the
level-set method, coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model. In
every time step, the fire model inputs the surface wind, which drives the fire,
and outputs the heat flux from the fire into the atmosphere, which in turn
influences the atmosphere. The level-set method allows submesh representation
of the burning region and flexible implementation of various ignition modes.
WRF-Fire is distributed as a part of WRF and it uses the WRF parallel
infrastructure for parallel computing.
