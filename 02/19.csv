Disregarding superconductivity the Fermi surface of the first model possesses
arcs whereas the second model has no arcs. We show that a large increase of
$\beta$ in the pseudogap region is generically incompatible with Fermi arcs in
the pseudogap state. Thus only the second model shows a large increase of
$\beta$ with decreasing doping. The required electron-phonon coupling is small

direct measurement of the size or even surface mapping with a resolution down

with a separation power comparable to that of the HST. The overall performance
of ALMA will make it an invaluable instrument to explore the outer solar

maximize the number of reconstructed B decay channels, it utilizes a
hierarchical reconstruction procedure and probabilistic calculus instead of
classical selection cuts. The multivariate analysis package NeuroBayes was used
extensively to hold the balance between highest possible efficiency, robustness
and acceptable consumption of CPU time.
  In total, 1104 exclusive decay channels were reconstructed, employing 71

cut-based classical reconstruction algorithm used at the Belle experiment, this
is an improvement in efficiency by roughly a factor of 2, depending on the
analysis considered.
  The new framework also features the ability to choose the desired purity or
efficiency of the fully reconstructed sample freely. If the same purity as for
the classical full reconstruction code is desired ~25%, the efficiency is still
larger by nearly a factor of 2. If, on the other hand, the efficiency is chosen
at a similar level as the classical full reconstruction, the purity rises from

strategy evolution in a population under natural selection. As the evolution
greatly depends on the interaction structure, there has been growing interests
in studying the games on graphs. In this setting, players occupy the vertices
of a graph and play the game only with their immediate neighbours. Various
evolutionary dynamics have been studied in this setting for different games.
Due to the complexity of the analysis, however, most of the work in this area
is experimental. This paper aims to contribute to a more complete
understanding, by providing rigorous analysis. We study the imitation dynamics
on two classes of graph: cycles and complete graphs. We focus on three well
known social dilemmas, namely the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Stag Hunt and the
Snowdrift Game. We also consider, for completeness, the so-called Harmony Game.
Our analysis shows that, on the cycle, all four games converge fast, either to
total cooperation or total defection. On the complete graph, all but the
Snowdrift game converge fast, either to cooperation or defection. The Snowdrift
game reaches a metastable state fast, where cooperators and defectors coexist.
It will converge to cooperation or defection only after spending time in this
state which is exponential in the size, n, of the graph. In exceptional cases,
it will remain in this state indefinitely. Our theoretical results are
supported by experimental investigations.

particles escape the shock and interact with a surrounding massive dense shell
producing hard photon emission. To calculate this emission, we have developed a
new Monte Carlo technique for propagating the cosmic rays (CRs) produced by the
forward shock of the SNR, into the dense, external material. This technique is
incorporated in a hydrodynamic model of an evolving SNR which includes the
nonlinear feedback of CRs on the SNR evolution, the production of escaping CRs
along with those that remain trapped within the remnant, and the broad-band
emission of radiation from trapped and escaping CRs. While our combined
CR-hydro-escape model is quite general and applies to both core collapse and
thermonuclear supernovae, the parameters we choose for our discussion here are
more typical of SNRs from very massive stars whose emission spectra differ
somewhat from those produced by lower mass progenitors directly interacting
with a molecular cloud.

  Adaptively Selected Similarities",,,,,"cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical clustering based on pairwise similarities is a common tool used
in a broad range of scientific applications. However, in many problems it may
be expensive to obtain or compute similarities between the items to be
clustered. This paper investigates the hierarchical clustering of N items based
on a small subset of pairwise similarities, significantly less than the
complete set of N(N-1)/2 similarities. First, we show that if the intracluster
similarities exceed intercluster similarities, then it is possible to correctly
determine the hierarchical clustering from as few as 3N log N similarities. We
demonstrate this order of magnitude savings in the number of pairwise
similarities necessitates sequentially selecting which similarities to obtain
in an adaptive fashion, rather than picking them at random. We then propose an
active clustering method that is robust to a limited fraction of anomalous
similarities, and show how even in the presence of these noisy similarity
values we can resolve the hierarchical clustering using only O(N log^2 N)
pairwise similarities.

above T_c, no evidence of low-energy spin fluctuation is found in the
spin-lattice relaxation rate on both the 77Se and the 87Rb sites. Upon warming,
however, the Knight shifts and the spin-lattice relaxation rates of both nuclei
increase substantially with temperature. In particular, the Knight shift is
nearly isotropic and follow a function fit of K=a+bT^2 from T_c up to 300 K.

coincide with model-theoretic instability, so in their absence, structure
theorems and technology from stability theory apply. In addition to the theorem

explore the theoretical uncertainties associated with modeling contributions of
hadronic intermediate states. Taking into account constraints from low- and
high-energy, parity-conserving electroproduction measurements, choosing
different models for contributions from the non-resonant processes, and
performing the corresponding flavor rotations to obtain the electroweak
amplitude, we arrive at an estimate of the uncertainty in the total
contribution to the parity-violating asymmetry. At the kinematics of the Q-Weak
experiment, we obtain a correction to the asymmetry equivalent to a shift in
the proton weak charge of $(0.0054\pm0.0020)$. This should be compared to the
value of the proton's weak charge of $\qwp=0.0713\pm0.0008$ that includes SM
contributions at tree level and one-loop radiative corrections. Therefore, we
obtain a new Standard Model prediction for the parity-violating asymmetry in
the kinematics of the Q-Weak experiment of $(0.0767\pm0.0008\pm0.0020_{\gamma
Z})$. The latter error leads to a relative uncertainty of 2.8% in the
determination of the proton's weak charge, and is dominated by the uncertainty
in the isospin structure of the inclusive cross section. We argue that future
parity-violating inelastic $ep$ asymmetry measurements at low-to-moderate $Q^2$
and $W^2$ could be exploited to reduce the uncertainty associated with the
dispersion correction. Because the corresponding shift and error bar decrease
monotonically with decreasing beam energy, a determination of the proton's weak
charge with a lower-energy experiment or measurements of ""isotope ratios"" in
atomic parity-violation could provide a useful cross check on any implications
for physics beyond the Standard Model derived from the Q-Weak measurement.

(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never

at z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant
thereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global
accretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo
accretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN
feedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered
haloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.
Consequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode
would become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in
the cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.

out singly scattered Lyman-alpha (e.g., from the nearby AGN) and may be
inconsistent with some models of backscattering in a spherical outflow.
However, the effects of seeing, diminished signal-to-noise ratio, and angle
averaging within radial bins make it difficult to put strong constraints on the
radial polarization profile. The current constraints may be consistent with
higher density outflow models, spherically symmetric infall models,
photoionization by star formation within the nebula or the nearby AGN, resonant
scattering, or non-spherically symmetric cold accretion (i.e., along

infrared (IR; 8-1000um) luminosities >3x10^12 L_sun when derived by fitting
local SEDs to 24um photometry alone, we find these IR luminosity estimates to
be a factor of ~4 times larger than those estimated when the SED fitting
includes additional 16 and 70um data (and in some cases mid-infrared
spectroscopy and 850um data). This discrepancy arises from the fact that high
luminosity sources at z>>0 appear to have far- to mid-infrared ratios, as well
as aromatic feature equivalent widths, typical of lower luminosity galaxies in
the local Universe. Using our improved estimates for IR luminosity and AGN
contributions, we investigate the evolution of the IR luminosity density versus
redshift arising from star formation and AGN processes alone. We find that,
within the uncertainties, the total star formation driven IR luminosity density
is constant between 1.15 < z < 2.35, although our results suggest a slightly
larger value at z>2. AGN appear to account for <18% of the total IR luminosity
density integrated between 0< z < 2.35, contributing <25% at each epoch. LIRG
appear to dominate the star formation rate (SFR) density along with normal
star-forming galaxies (L_IR < 10^11 L_sun) between 0.6 < z < 1.15. Once beyond
z >2, the contribution from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs becomes
comparable with that of LIRGs. Using our improved IR luminosity estimates, we
find existing calibrations for UV extinction corrections based on measurements
of the UV spectral slope typically overcorrect UV luminosities by a factor of
~2, on average, for our sample of 24um-selected sources; accordingly we have
derived a new UV extinction correction more appropriate for our sample.

generated evolutionary models for brown dwarfs and very-low-mass stars (VLMs)
for different metallicities ([Fe/H]), with and without clouds. We find that the
spread in radius at a given mass and age can be as large as $\sim$10% to
$\sim$25%, with higher-metallicity, higher-cloud-thickness atmospheres
resulting quite naturally in larger radii. For each 0.1 dex increase in [Fe/H],
radii increase by $\sim$1% to $\sim$2.5%, depending upon age and mass. We also
find that, while for smaller masses and older ages brown dwarf radii decrease
with increasing helium fraction ($Y$) (as expected), for more massive brown
dwarfs and a wide range of ages they increase with helium fraction. The
increase in radius in going from $Y=0.25$ to $Y=0.28$ can be as large as
$\sim$0.025 \rj\ ($\sim$2.5%). Furthermore, we find that for VLMs an increase
in atmospheric metallicity from 0.0 to 0.5 dex, increases radii by $\sim$4%,
and from -0.5 to 0.5 dex by $\sim$10%. Therefore, we suggest that opacity due
to higher metallicity might naturally account for the apparent radius anomalies
in some eclipsing VLM systems. Ten to twenty-five percent variations in radius
exceed errors stemming from uncertainities in the equation of state alone. This
serves to emphasize that transit and eclipse measurements of brown dwarf radii
constrain numerous effects collectively, importantly including the atmosphere
and condensate cloud models, and not just the equation of state. At all times,

numerical technique can follow spherically-symmetric Bondi accretion. Using the
3D SPH code GADGET-3, we perform simulations of gas accretion onto a central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass 10^8 M_sun within the radial range of
0.1 - 200 pc. We carry out simulations without and with radiative heating by a
central X-ray corona and radiative cooling. For an adiabatic case, the radial
profiles of hydrodynamical properties match the Bondi solution, except near the
inner and outer radius of the computational domain. We find that adiabatic
Bondi accretion can be reproduced for durations of a few dynamical times at the
Bondi radius, and for longer times if the outer radius is increased. With
radiative heating and cooling included, the spherically accreting gas takes a
longer time to reach a steady-state than the adiabatic Bondi accretion runs,
and in some cases does not reach a steady-state even within several hundred
dynamical times. We find that artificial viscosity in the GADGET code causes
excessive heating near the inner radius, making the thermal properties of the
gas inconsistent with a physical solution. This overheating occurs typically
only in the supersonic part of the flow, so that it does not affect the mass
accretion rate. We see that increasing the X-ray luminosity produces a lower
central mass inflow rate, implying that feedback due to radiative heating is
operational in our simulations. With a sufficiently high X-ray luminosity, the
inflowing gas is radiatively heated up, and an outflow develops. We conclude
that the SPH simulations can capture the gas dynamics needed to study radiative
feedback provided artificial viscosity alters only highly supersonic part of
the inflow.

indicate another super-Earth planet in the system of Gliese 581 located in the
midst of the stellar climatological habitable zone. The mass of the planet,
known as Gl 581g, has been estimated to be between 3.1 and 4.3 Earth masses. In
this study, we investigate the habitability of Gl 581g based on a previously
used concept that explores its long-term possibility of photosynthetic biomass
production, which has already been used to gauge the principal possibility of
life regarding the super-Earths Gl 581c and Gl 581d. Methods: A thermal
evolution model for super-Earths is used to calculate the sources and sinks of
atmospheric carbon dioxide. The habitable zone is determined by the limits of
photosynthetic biological productivity on the planetary surface. Models with
different ratios of land / ocean coverage are pursued. Results: The maximum
time span for habitable conditions is attained for water worlds at a position
of about 0.14+/-0.015 AU, which deviates by just a few percent (depending on
the adopted stellar luminosity) from the actual position of Gl 581g, an
estimate that does however not reflect systematic uncertainties inherent in our
model. Therefore, in the framework of our model an almost perfect Goldilock
position is realized. The existence of habitability is found to critically
depend on the relative planetary continental area, lending a considerable
advantage to the possibility of life if Gl 581g's ocean coverage is relatively
high. Conclusions: Our results are a further step toward identifying the
possibility of life beyond the Solar System, especially concerning super-Earth
planets, which appear to be more abundant than previously surmised.

we have discovered three DLAs and four sub-DLAs. We measure the neutral gas
density Omega(HI), and redshift density dN/dz, of DLA and sub-DLA systems at
z<0.35. We find dN/dz=0.25 and Omega(HI)=1.4x10^-3 for DLAs, and dN/dz=0.08
with Omega(HI)=4.2x10^-5 for sub-DLAs over a redshift path delta z=11.9. To
demonstrate the scientific potential of such systems, we present a detailed
analysis of the DLA at z=0.1140 in the spectrum of SDSS J1009+0713. Profile
fits to the absorption lines determine log N(H I)=20.68pm0.10 with a
metallicity determined from the undepleted element Sulfur of [S/H]=-0.62pm0.18.
The abundance pattern of this DLA is similar to that of higher z DLAs, showing
mild depletion of the refractory elements Fe and Ti with [S/Fe]=+0.24pm0.22 and
[S/Ti]=+0.28pm0.15. Nitrogen is underabundant in this system with
[N/H]=-1.40pm0.14, placing this DLA below the plateau of the [N/alpha]
measurements in the local Universe at similar metallicities. This DLA has a
simple kinematic structure with only two components required to fit the
profiles and a kinematic width of 52 km/s. Imaging of the QSO field with WFC3
reveals a spiral galaxy at very small impact parameter to the QSO and several
galaxies within 10"". Followup spectra with LRIS reveal that none of the nearby
galaxies are at the redshift of the DLA. The spiral galaxy is identified as the
host galaxy of the QSO based on the near perfect alignment of the nucleus and

contexts. An universal criterion for the identification of this phenomenon in
Abelian gauge theories is suggested: the so-called spontaneous breaking of the
brane symmetry. This local symmetry has its most common manifestation in the
Dirac string ambiguity present in the electromagnetic theory with monopoles.
The spontaneous breaking of the brane symmetry means that the Dirac string
becomes part of a brane invariant observable which hides the realization of
such a symmetry and develops energy content in the confinement regime. The
establishment of this regime can be reached through the condensation of
topological defects. The effective theory of the confinement regime can be
obtained with the Julia-Toulouse prescription which (originally introduced as
the dual mechanism to the Abelian Higgs Mechanism) is generalized in this paper
in order to become fully compatible with Elitzur's theorem and describe more
general condensates which may break Lorentz and discrete spacetime symmetries.
This generalized approach for the condensation of defects is presented here
through a series of different applications.

analysis: describing and categorizing nodes according to how they interact with
other nodes. Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets
of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence.
Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are
nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence may be rare, a more meaningful
task is to measure the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is
closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank
attempts to solve. However, SimRank and most of its offshoots are not
sufficient because they do not fully recognize automorphically or structurally
equivalent nodes. In this paper we tackle two problems. First, what are the
necessary properties for a role similarity measure or metric? Second, how can
we derive a role similarity measure satisfying these properties? For the first
problem, we justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role
similarity measure or metric: range, maximal similarity, automorphic
equivalence, transitive similarity, and the triangle inequality. For the second
problem, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric with a simple iterative
computational method. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all the
axiomatic properties. We also introduce an iceberg RoleSim algorithm which can
guarantee to discover all pairs with RoleSim score no less than a user-defined
threshold $\theta$ without computing the RoleSim for every pair. We demonstrate
the superior interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and real

scaling of the fluctuations probabilities. The primary large-deviations rate
function is the entropy, which is the basis for both fluctuation theorems and
for characterizing the thermodynamic interactions of systems. Freidlin-Wentzell
theory provides a general formulation of large-deviations scaling for
non-equilibrium stochastic processes, through a representation in terms of a
Hamiltonian dynamical system. A number of related methods now exist to
construct the Freidlin-Wentzell Hamiltonian for many kinds of stochastic
processes; one method due to Doi and Peliti, appropriate to integer counting
statistics, is widely used in reaction-diffusion theory.
  Using these tools together with a path-entropy method due to Jaynes, we show
how to construct entropy functions that both express large-deviations scaling
of fluctuations, and describe system-environment interactions, for discrete
stochastic processes either at or away from equilibrium. A collection of
variational methods familiar within quantum field theory, but less commonly
applied to the Doi-Peliti construction, is used to define a ""stochastic
effective action"", which is the large-deviations rate function for arbitrary
non-equilibrium paths.
  We show how common principles of entropy maximization, applied to different
ensembles of states or of histories, lead to different entropy functions and
different sets of thermodynamic state variables. Yet the relations of among all
these levels of description may be constructed explicitly and understood in
terms of information conditions. The example systems considered introduce
methods that may be used to systematically construct descriptions with all the
features familiar from equilibrium thermodynamics, for a much wider range of
systems describable by stochastic processes.

dimensions to sets of abelian plane wave configurations of varying amplitude
and wavelength, and sets of non-abelian constant configurations. The results
are compared to the predictions of several proposed versions of the Yang-Mills
vacuum wavefunctional that have appeared in the literature. These include (i) a
suggestion in temporal gauge due to Greensite and Olejnik; (ii) the ""new
variables"" wavefunction put forward by Karabali, Kim, and Nair; (iii) a hybrid
proposal combining features of the temporal gauge and new variables
wavefunctionals; and (iv) Coulomb gauge wavefunctionals developed by Reinhardt
and co-workers, and by Szczepaniak and co-workers. We find that wavefunctionals
which simplify to a ""dimensional reduction"" form at large scales, i.e. which
have the form of a probability distribution for two-dimensional lattice gauge
theory, when evaluated on long-wavelength configurations, have the optimal
agreement with the data.

fixed Rashba coupling, and a four-level case that adds a controllable
Dresselhaus contribution. We describe an implementation of the four level

However, for sufficiently intense laser fields the continuous rotational
symmetry approximately holds, making the Rashba Hamiltonian applicable for cold

by the time-reversal test; the system evolved in the forward direction for a

perturbation at the reversal time, and the separation between the time-reversed
perturbed and unperturbed states is measured as a function of perturbation
strength, which characterizes sensitivity of the time reversed system to the
perturbation and is called the time-reversal characteristic.
  Time-reversal characteristics are investigated for various quantum systems,
namely, classically chaotic quantum systems and disordered systems including
various stochastic diffusion systems. When the system is normally diffusive,
there exists a fundamental quantum unit of perturbation, and all the models
exhibit a universal scaling behavior in the time-reversal dynamics as well as
in the time-reversal characteristics, which leads us to a basic understanding
on the nature of quantum irreversibility.

of intensity, magnetic field and plasma velocity (Dopplergrams) on the surface

form of compact and rapid variations of the HMI observables (Doppler velocity,
line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity). These variations, caused
by the impact of high-energy particles in the photosphere, formed a typical
two-ribbon flare structure. The sunquake can be easily seen in the raw
Dopplergram differences without any special data processing. The source of this

behaviour of the masers in these two star forming regions can be ascribed to
changes in the environment of the masers or in the continuum emission from
parts of the background \ion{H}{2} region. It is found that the light curves of
widely different shape and amplitude in these two objects can be explained
within the framework of a periodic pulse of ionizing radiation that raises the
electron density in a volume of partially ionized gas against which the masers
are projected. It is also shown that the decay of the 11.405 $\kmps$ maser in
G188.95+0.89 can be explained very well in terms of the recombination of the
ionized gas against which the maser is projected while it would require very
special conditions to explain it in terms of changes in environment of the
maser. We conclude that for G9.62+0.20E and G188.95+0.89 the observed changes

By
using the general principles of ST, the first-law-like energy balance and
trajectory-dependent entropy s(t) can be well-defined in a similar way as that
in a system without delay. Since the presence of time delay brings an
additional entropy flux into the system, the conventional second law $<{\Delta
{s_{tot}}}> \ge 0$ no longer holds true, where $\Delta {s_{tot}}$ denotes the
total entropy change along a stochastic path and $<...>$ stands for average
over the path ensemble. With the help of a Fokker-Planck description, we
introduce a delay-averaged trajectory-dependent dissipation functional $\eta
[{\chi(t)}]$ which involves the work done by a delay-averaged force $\bar
F({x,t})$ along the path $\chi (t)$ and equals to the medium entropy change
$\Delta {s_m}[ {x(t)}]$ in the absence of delay. We show that the total
dissipation functional R = \Delta s + \eta, where $\Delta s$ denotes the system
entropy change along a path, obeys $< R > \ge 0$, which could be viewed as the
second law in the delayed system. In addition, the integral fluctuation theorem
$< <e^(-R)>=1 also holds true. We apply these concepts to a linear Langevin
system with time delay and periodic external force. Numerical results
demonstrate that the total entropy change $< {\Delta {s_{tot}}} >$ could indeed
be negative when the delay feedback is positive. By using an inversing-mapping
approach, we are able to obtain the delay-averaged force $\bar F({x,t})$ from
the stationary distribution and then calculate the functional $R$ as well as
its distribution. The second law $< R > \ge 0$ and the fluctuation theorem are
successfully validated.

turbulent mixing affects the disk chemistry in the warm molecular layers,
influencing the line emission from the disk and subsequently improving
agreement with observations. We find that NH3, CH3OH, C2H2 and

enhanced due to tensor interaction. We demonstrate that for sufficiently

the probabilities of two-nucleon (2N) SRCs from the analysis of the

the protons with fractional densities 1/9 will populate mostly the high

do so. We discuss the implications of this condition for neutron stars and
emphasize that it may be characteristic to any asymmetric two component Fermi

the submodularity ratio is a stronger predictor of the performance of greedy

from the analogous state of spin-0 particles, whose binding energy was
intensively studied more than forty years ago. We show that binding energy
equations for spin-1/2 particles can be obtained without using the language of
boundary conditions in the $\delta$-potential model developed in pioneering
works. We use the obtained equations to calculate the energy level
displacements analytically and demonstrate nonlinear dependencies on field
intensity. We show that the magnetic field indeed plays a stabilizing role in
considered systems in a case of the weak intensity, but the opposite occurs in
the case of strong intensity. These properties may be important for real
quantum mechanical fermionic systems in two and three dimensions. We also
analyze the exact solution of the Pauli equation for an electron moving in the
potential field determined by the three-dimensional $\delta$-well in the
presence of a strong magnetic field. We obtain asymptotic expressions for this
solution for different values of the problem parameters. In addition, we
consider electron probability currents and their dependence on the magnetic
field. We show that including the spin in the framework of the nonrelativistic

degree less than $k$. A graph is $k$-forested $q$-choosable if for a given list
of $q$ colors associated with each vertex $v$, there exists a $k$-forested
coloring of $G$ such that each vertex receives a color from its own list. In
this paper, we prove that the $k$-forested choosability of a graph with maximum
degree $\Delta\geq k\geq 4$ is at most $\lceil\frac{\Delta}{k-1}\rceil+1$,
$\lceil\frac{\Delta}{k-1}\rceil+2$ or $\lceil\frac{\Delta}{k-1}\rceil+3$ if its
maximum average degree is less than 12/5, $8/3 or 3, respectively.

to a self-organized state of typical behaviors in a community. In this paper,
we model self-organization in social tagging systems and illustrate the
underlying interaction and dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a model in
which individuals adjust their own tagging tendency to imitate the average
tagging tendency. We found that when users are of low confidence, they tend to
imitate others and lead to a self-organized state with active tagging. On the
other hand, when users are of high confidence and are stubborn for changes,
tagging becomes inactive. We observe a phase transition at a critical level of
user confidence when the system changes from one regime to the other. The
distributions of post length obtained from the model are compared to real data
which show good agreements.

in cellular responses to changing environments. For several sRNAs, regulation
is effected by coupled stoichiometric degradation with messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
The nonlinearity inherent in this regulatory scheme indicates that exact
analytical solutions for the corresponding stochastic models are intractable.
Here, we present a variational approach to analyze a well-studied stochastic
model for regulation by sRNAs via coupled degradation. The proposed approach is
efficient and provides accurate estimates of mean mRNA levels as well as higher
order terms. Results from the variational ansatz are in excellent agreement
with data from stochastic simulations for a wide range of parameters, including
regions of parameter space where mean-field approaches break down. The proposed
approach can be applied to quantitatively model stochastic gene expression in
complex regulatory networks.

existence of a random field solution for some linear s.p.d.e.'s of parabolic
and hyperbolic type. These equations rely on a spatial operator $\cL$ given by
the $L^2$-generator of a $d$-dimensional L\'evy process $X=(X_t)_{t \geq 0}$,
and are driven by a spatially-homogeneous Gaussian noise, which is fractional
in time with Hurst index $H>1/2$. As an application, we consider the case when
$X$ is a $\beta$-stable process, with $\beta \in (0,2]$. In the parabolic case,
we develop a connection with the potential theory of the Markov process
$\bar{X}$ (defined as the symmetrization of $X$), and we show that the
existence of the solution is related to the existence of a ""weighted""
intersection local time of two independent copies of $\bar{X}$.

quantum walks, on Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}ny graphs in the presence of a random
distribution of traps. The role of trap concentration and of the substrate
dilution is deepened showing that, at long times and for intermediate degree of
dilution, the survival probability typically decays exponentially with a
(average) decay rate which depends non monotonically on the graph connectivity;
when the degree of dilution is either very low or very high, stationary states,
not affected by traps, get more likely giving rise to a survival probability
decaying to a finite value. Both these features constitute a qualitative
difference with respect to the behavior found for classical walks.

force microscopy taking into account mechanical energy dissipation through the
attachment of the tuning fork base. We find that the tuning fork resonator
quality factor changes even for the case of a purely elastic sensor-sample
interaction. This is due to the effective mechanical imbalance of the tuning
fork prongs induced by the sensor-sample force gradient which in turn has an
impact on the dissipation through the attachment of the resonator base. This
effect may yield a measured dissipation signal that can be different to the one
exclusively related to the dissipation between the sensor and the sample. We
also find that there is a second order term in addition to the linear
relationship between the sensor-sample force gradient and the resonance
frequency shift of the tuning fork that is significant even for force gradients
usually present in atomic force microscopy which are in the range of tens of
N/m.
