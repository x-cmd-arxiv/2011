information loss, suggested that there must be some essential irreconcilable
conflict between quantum theory and classical gravity theory, which cannot be
solved with any semiclassical quantized model of gravity, the only feasible way
must be some complete unified quantum theory of gravity.
  In \cite{Vachaspati2007a}, the arguments indicate the possibility of an
alternate outcome of gravitational collapse which avoids the information loss
problem. In this paper, also with semiclassical analysis, it shows that so long
as the mechanism of black hole evaporation satisfies a quite loose condition
that the evaporation lifespan is finite for external observers, regardless of
the detailed mechanism and process of evaporation, the conundrums above can be
naturally avoided. This condition can be satisfied with Hawking-Unruh
mechanism. Thus, the conflict between quantum theory and classical gravity
theory may be not as serious as it seemed to be, the effectiveness of
semiclassical methods might be underestimated.
  An exact universal solution with spherical symmetry of Einstein field
equation has been derived in this paper. All possible solutions with spherical
symmetry of Einstein field equation are its special cases.
  In addition, some problems of the Penrose diagram of an evaporating black
hole first introduced by Hawking in 1975 \cite{Hawking1975} are clarified.

multiple fault tolerant computing. Existing recovery schemes are efficient for
single fault but not with multiple faults. Recovery scheme proposed in this
paper having two phases; sequentially phase, concurrent phase. In sequentially
phase, loads of all working nodes are uniformly and evenly distributed by
proposed dynamic rank based and load distribution algorithm. In concurrent
phase, loads of all failure nodes as well as new job arrival are assigned
equally to all available nodes by just finding the least loaded node among the
several nodes by failure nodes job allocation algorithm. Sequential and
concurrent executions of algorithms improve the performance as well better
resource utilization. Dynamic rank based algorithm for load redistribution
works as a sequential restoration algorithm and reassignment algorithm for
distribution of failure nodes to least loaded computing nodes works as a
concurrent recovery reassignment algorithm. Since load is evenly and uniformly
distributed among all available working nodes with less number of iterations,
low iterative time and communication overheads hence performance is improved.
Dynamic ranking algorithm is low overhead, high convergence algorithm for
reassignment of tasks uniformly among all available nodes. Reassignments of
failure nodes are done by a low overhead efficient failure job allocation
algorithm. Test results to show effectiveness of the proposed scheme are
presented.

We use shearing-sheet simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence that is helically
forced at a wavenumber that is about three times larger than the lowest
wavenumber in the domain so that both {\alpha} - {\Omega} and {\alpha}2 dynamo
action is possible. Results. After initial dominance and saturation, the

two processes through which this transition can occur. Conclusions. The

overlapping communities in complex networks, which is understood as dense
groups of nodes featuring a low outbound density. To date, most methods used to
compute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by
either extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by
attempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly
overlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by
introducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The
cohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the
notions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of
the classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion
if it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with
the rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of
communities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new
approach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept
of ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node,
specifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a
heuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to
maximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a
detailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends. We
finally conclude by describing promising applications of ego-munities such as
information inference and interest recommendations, and present a possible
extension to cohesion in the case of weighted networks.

of electron-ion and electron-positron-ion magnetoplasmas with diverse equations

a critical-angle of $\beta_{cr}=\arccos{\left[B_0 /(0.137 \sqrt{n_0})\right]}$

strong simplifying assumptions are made, a diagnostic dependence of convection
on the large-scale environment and the limit of many plumes often being imposed
from the outset. Some recent studies have sought to remove one or the other of
those assumptions. The proposed framework removes both, and is explicitly
time-dependent and stochastic in its basic character. The statistical dynamics
of the plume collection are defined through simple probabilistic rules applied
at the level of individual plumes, and van Kampen's system size expansion is
then used to construct the macroscopic limit of the microscopic model. Through
suitable choices of the microscopic rules, the model is shown to encompass
previous studies in the appropriate limits, and to allow their natural

space. We follow the approach of Gaston Darboux who was the first to give the
first general treatment of $R$-separability in PDE (Laplace equation on
${\mathbb E}^3$). According to Darboux $R$-separability amounts to two
conditions: metric is isothermic (all its parametric surfaces are isothermic in
the sense of both classical differential geometry and modern theory of
solitons) and moreover when an isothermic metric is given their Lam\'e
coefficients satisfy a single constraint which is either functional (when $R$
is harmonic) or differential (in the opposite case). These two conditions are
generalized to $n$-dimensional case. In particular we define $n$-dimensional
isothermic metrics and distinguish an important subclass of isothermic metrics
which we call binary metrics. The approach is illustrated by two standard
examples and two less standard examples. In all cases the approach offers
alternative and much simplified proofs or derivations. We formulate a
systematic procedure to isolate $R$-separable metrics. This procedure is
implemented in the case of 3-dimensional Laplace equation. Finally we discuss
the class of Dupin-cyclidic metrics which are non-regularly $R$-separable in

extensively by several X-ray observatories. Here, we report on four XMM-Newton
observations elapsing a period of more than 19 months and starting in November
2008. The X-ray spectra show a soft thermal component which we fit with a
neutron star atmosphere model. Only in the first observation do we find a
significant second component above ~ 3 keV accounting for ~ 7 % of the total
flux, which could indicate residual accretion. The thermal bolometric flux and
the temperature of the neutron star crust decrease steadily by 40 and 10 %
respectively between the first and the fourth observation. At the time of the
last observation, June 2010, we obtain a thermal bolometric luminosity of 5.6 x
10$^{33}$ (d/7.1 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a temperature of the neutron star
crust of 109 eV. The cooling curve is consistent with a relatively hot,
medium-mass neutron star, cooling by standard mechanisms. From the spectral
fits to a neutron star atmosphere model we infer limits for the mass and the
radius of the neutron star. We find that in order to achieve self-consistency
for the NS mass between the different methods, the value of the distance is
constrained to be <~6 kpc. For this value of the distance, the derived mass and
radius contours are consistent with a number of EoSs with nucleons and
hyperons.

physics of the low density region at the Dirac point has been difficult because
of the presence of disorder which leaves the graphene with local microscopic
electron and hole puddles, resulting in a finite density of carriers even at
the charge neutrality point. Efforts have been made to reduce the disorder by
suspending graphene, leading to fabrication challenges and delicate devices
which make local spectroscopic measurements difficult. Recently, it has been
shown that placing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) yields improved
device performance. In this letter, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to
show that graphene conforms to hBN, as evidenced by the presence of Moire
patterns in the topographic images. However, contrary to recent predictions,
this conformation does not lead to a sizable band gap due to the misalignment
of the lattices. Moreover, local spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the
electron-hole charge fluctuations are reduced by two orders of magnitude as
compared to those on silicon oxide. This leads to charge fluctuations which are
as small as in suspended graphene, opening up Dirac point physics to more
diverse experiments than are possible on freestanding devices.

normalizing constant shown to be consistent using theory developed by
Chatterjee and Varadhan [European J. Combin. 32 (2011) 1000-1017]. The theory
explains a host of difficulties encountered by applied workers: many distinct
models have essentially the same MLE, rendering the problems ``practically''
ill-posed. We give the first rigorous proofs of ``degeneracy'' observed in
these models. Here, almost all graphs have essentially no edges or are
essentially complete. We supplement recent work of Bhamidi, Bresler and Sly
[2008 IEEE 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)
(2008) 803-812 IEEE] showing that for many models, the extra sufficient
statistics are useless: most realizations look like the results of a simple
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model. We also find classes of models where the limiting
graphs differ from Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. A limitation of our approach,
inherited from the limitation of graph limit theory, is that it works only for
dense graphs.

term reductions. We stress that this fact can be interpreted in two ways.
According to the ""sequential interpretation"", a term graph reduction
corresponds to an infinite sequence of term reductions, as formalized by
Kennaway et.al. using strongly converging derivations over the complete metric
space of infinite terms. Instead according to the ""parallel interpretation"" a
term graph reduction corresponds to the parallel reduction of an infinite set
of redexes in a rational term. We formalize the latter notion by exploiting the

the topological structure of the object whose topological consistency is then

based on the contraction of a certain class of 'future' (also: virtual)
redexes.
  In the implementation of functional programming languages it is common
practice to perform beta-reductions at compile time whenever possible in order
to produce code that requires fewer reductions at run time. This is, however,
in principle limited to redexes and created redexes that are 'visible' (in the
sense that they can be contracted without the need for unsharing), and cannot
generally be extended to redexes that are concealed by sharing constructs such
as letrec. In the case of recursion, concealed redexes become visible only
after unwindings during evaluation, and then have to be contracted time and
again.
  We observe that in some cases such redexes exhibit a certain form of
repetitive behaviour at run time. We describe an analysis for identifying
binders that give rise to such repetitive reduction patterns, and eliminate
them by a sort of predictive contraction. Thereby these binders are lifted out
of recursive positions or eliminated altogether, as a result alleviating the
amount of beta-reductions required for each recursive iteration.
  Both our analysis and simplification are suitable to be integrated into
existing compilers for functional programming languages as an additional
optimisation phase. With this work we hope to contribute to increasing the
efficiency of executing programs written in such languages.

soft X-ray emission is observed to extend from 30 pc to 1.3 kpc in the
south-west from the nucleus, much farther than seen in earlier X-ray studies.
The terminus of the north-eastern X-ray emission is spatially coincident with a
CO gas lane, where the outflow likely encounters dense gas in the host galactic
disk. X-ray emission is also detected outside the boundaries of the ionization
cone, which indicates that the gas there is not completely shielded from the
nuclear continuum, as would be the case for a molecular torus collimating the
bicone. In the central r<200 pc region, the subpixel processing of the ACIS
data recovers the morphological details on scales of <30~pc (<0.5"") first
discovered in Chandra HRC images. The X-ray emission is more absorbed towards
the boundaries of the ionization cone, as well as perpendicular to the bicone
along the direction of a putative torus in NGC 4151. The innermost region where
X-ray emission shows the highest hardness ratio, is spatially coincident with
the near-infrared resolved H_2 emission and dusty spirals we find in an HST V-H
color image. The agreement between the observed H_2 line flux and the value
predicted from X-ray-irradiated molecular cloud models supports
photo-excitation by X-rays from the active nucleus as the origin of the H_2
line, although contribution from UV fluorescence or collisional excitation
cannot be fully ruled out with current data. The discrepancy between the mass
of cold molecular gas inferred from recent CO and near-infrared H_2
observations may be explained by the anomalous CO abundance in this X-ray
dominated region. The total H_2 mass derived from the X-ray observation agrees
with measurement in Storchi-Bergmann et al.

back-reaction and an ""effective"" acceleration (in the context of Buchert's
averaging formalism) in regular generic spherically symmetric
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) dust models. By considering arbitrary spherical
comoving domains, we verify rigorously the fulfillment of these conditions
expressed in terms of suitable scalar variables that are evaluated at the
boundary of every domain. Effective deceleration necessarily occurs in all
domains in: (a) the asymptotic radial range of models converging to a FLRW
background, (b) the asymptotic time range of non-vacuum hyperbolic models, (c)
LTB self-similar solutions and (d) near a simultaneous big bang. Accelerating
domains are proven to exist in the following scenarios: (i) central vacuum
regions, (ii) central (non-vacuum) density voids, (iii) the intermediate radial
range of models converging to a FLRW background, (iv) the asymptotic radial
range of models converging to a Minkowski vacuum and (v) domains near and/or
intersecting a non-simultaneous big bang. All these scenarios occur in
hyperbolic models with negative averaged and local spatial curvature, though
scenarios (iv) and (v) are also possible in low density regions of a class of
elliptic models in which local spatial curvature is negative but its average is
positive. Rough numerical estimates between -0.003 and -0.5 were found for the
effective deceleration parameter. While the existence of accelerating domains
cannot be ruled out in models converging to an Einstein de Sitter background
and in domains undergoing gravitational collapse, the conditions for this are
very restrictive. The results obtained may provide important theoretical clues
on the effects of back-reaction and averaging in more general non-spherical
models.

promote oyster survival, disease resistance and growth, in contrast to
low-relief reefs which degrade in just a few years. These findings suggest the
existence of alternative stable states in oyster reef populations. We developed
a mathematical model consisting of three differential equations that represent

Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations demonstrated that multiple
nonnegative equilibria can exist for live oyster, accreting reef and sediment
volume at an ecologically reasonable range of parameter values; the initial

generalized linear bandits, and other linear control problems.
  We improve the regret bound of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm of
Auer et al. (2002) and show that its regret is with high-probability a problem
dependent constant. In the case of linear bandits (Dani et al., 2008), we
improve the problem dependent bound in the dimension and number of time steps.
Furthermore, as opposed to the previous result, we prove that our bound holds
for small sample sizes, and at the same time the worst case bound is improved
by a logarithmic factor and the constant is improved.

\textit{in situ} probe of surface morphology during thin film growth, but
complete interpretation of the results requires modeling the growth process.
Many models have been developed and employed for this purpose, yet no detailed,
comparative studies of their scope and accuracy exists in the literature. Using
experimental data obtained from hyperthermal deposition of pentane and
diindenoperylene (DIP) on SiO$_2$, we compare and contrast three such models,
both with each other and with detailed characterization of the surface
morphology using ex-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). These two systems each
exhibit particular phenomena of broader interest: pentacene/SiO$_2$ exhibits a
rapid transition from rough to smooth growth. DIP/SiO$_2$, under the conditions
employed here, exhibits growth rate acceleration due to a different sticking
probability between the substrate and film. In general, \textit{independent of
which model is used}, we find good agreement between the surface morphology
obtained from fits to the \insitu x-ray data with the actual morphology at
early times. This agreement deteriorates at later time, once the root-mean
squared (rms) film roughness exceeds about 1 ML. A second observation is that,
because layer coverages are under-determined by the evolution of a single point
on the reflectivity curve, we find that the best fits to reflectivity data ---
corresponding to the lowest values of $\chi_\nu^2$ --- do not necessarily yield
the best agreement between simulated and measured surface morphologies.
Instead, it appears critical that the model reproduce all local extrema in the
data. In addition to showing that layer morphologies can be extracted from a
minimal set of data, the methodology established here provides a basis for
improving models of multilayer growth by comparison to real systems.

cross-section at one-loop, while the hard-pole contribution in the

also solve a part of discrepancy in evolutions of the twist-3 operator. The

possible to directly detect the cosmic antineutrino background by using the
rather stable isotope holmium-163 as a target, which can decay into
dysprosium-163 via electron capture (EC) with a very small energy release. In
this paper we calculate the rate of the relic antineutrino capture on
holmium-163 nuclei against the corresponding EC decay rate by taking account of
different neutrino mass hierarchies and reasonable values of theta_13. We show
that such flavor effects are appreciable and even important in some cases, and
stress that a calorimetric measurement of the cosmic antineutrino background
might be feasible in the far future.

Electric field induced anisotropic interaction between two heteronuclear ground

Near such resonances the amplitude of scattering wave function at short

photoaasociation rate is enhanced by several orders of magnitude near the

has so far received little attention. Previous studies of this effect have
suggested that it might play an important role in mixing the various phases of
the interstellar medium. In this paper we examine the potential effects of
turbulent diffusion on the deuterium chemistry within molecular clouds. We find
that such mixing acts to reduce the efficiency of deuteration in these clouds
by increasing the ionization fraction and reducing freeze-out of heavy
molecules. This leads to lower abundances for many deuterated species. We also
examine the influence of turbulent mixing on the transition from atomic
hydrogen to H2 and from atomic deuterium to HD near the cloud edge. We find
that including turbulent diffusion in our models serves to push these
transitions deeper into the cloud and helps maintain a higher atomic fraction
throughout the cloud envelope. Based on these findings, we propose a new
process to account for the significant scatter in the observed atomic D/H ratio
for galactic sightlines extending beyond the Local Bubble. Although several
mechanisms have been put forward to explain this scatter, they are unable to
fully account for the range in D/H values. We suggest a scenario in which
turbulent mixing of atomic and molecular gas at the edges of molecular clouds
causes the observed atomic D/H ratio to vary by a factor of ~2.

These structure functions are calculated by assuming that the virtual photon
interacts with only one bound nucleon. We use the most recent model for the
elementary current operator which gives a good description of the experimental
data for the corresponding elementary process. The bound state wave functions
for the bound nucleon and hyperon are calculated within a relativistic
mean-field model. We calculate the unpolarized triple differential cross
section for the hypernuclear production process e + 12C --> e + K+ +
12_Lambda{B} as a function of the kaon scattering angle. The nuclear structure
functions are calculated within a particle-hole model. The cross section
displays a characteristic form of being large for small values of the kaon
scattering angle with a smooth fall-off to zero with increasing angle. The
shape of the cross section is essentially determined by the nuclear structure
functions. In addition, it is found that for the unpolarized triple
differential cross section one structure function is negligible over the entire
range of the kaon scattering angle.

of BPSK and circular linearly modulated signals with unknown (and possibly
different) baud rates and carrier frequencies. In previous works, we
established that the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) is able to extract a
source from a convolutive mixture of circular linearly modulated signals. We
extend the analysis of the extraction capabilities of the CMA when the mixing
also contains BPSK signals. We prove that if the various source signals do not
share any non zero cyclic frequency nor any non conjugate cyclic frequencies,
the local minima of the constant modulus cost function are separating filters.
Unfortunately, the minimization of the Godard cost function generally fails
when considering BPSK signals that have the same rates and the same carrier
frequencies. This failure is due to the existence of non-separating local
minima of the Godard cost function. In order to achieve the separation, we
propose a simple modification of the Godard cost function which only requires
knowledge of the BPSK sources frequency offsets at the receiver side. We
provide various simulations of realistic digital communications scenarios that
support our theoretical statements.

of two polymers connected by one end and subject to an attractive interaction
between complementary monomers. In zipping, the polymers are quenched from a
high temperature equilibrium configuration to a low temperature state, so that
the two strands zip up by closing up a ""Y""-fork. In unzipping, the polymers are
brought from a low temperature double stranded configuration to high
temperatures, so that the two strands separate. Simulations show that the
unzipping time, $\tau_u$, scales as a function of the polymer length as $\tau_u
\sim L$, while the zipping is characterized by anomalous dynamics $\tau_z \sim
L^\alpha$ with $\alpha = 1.37(2)$. This exponent is in good agreement with
simulation results and theoretical predictions for the scaling of the
translocation time of a forced polymer passing through a narrow pore. We find
that the exponent $\alpha$ is robust against variations of parameters and
temperature, whereas the scaling of $\tau_z$ as a function of the driving force
shows the existence of two different regimes: the weak forcing ($\tau_z \sim
1/F$) and strong forcing ($\tau_z$ independent of $F$) regimes. The crossover
region is possibly characterized by a non-trivial scaling in $F$, matching the
prediction of recent theories of polymer translocation. Although the
geometrical setup is different, zipping and translocation share thus the same
type of anomalous dynamics. Systems where this dynamics could be experimentally
investigated are DNA (or RNA) hairpins: our results imply an anomalous dynamics
for the hairpins closing times, but not for the opening times.

order to examine the behaviour of the best candidates for detection with next

planetary angular velocity and the plasma mass outflow rate from sources
internal to the magnetosphere. In all XUV luminosity cases studied, a
significant number of parameter combinations within an order of magnitude of
the jovian values are capable of producing emissions observable beyond 1 pc, in
most cases requiring exoplanets orbiting at distances between ~1 and 50 AU, and
for the higher XUV luminosity cases these observable distances can reach beyond
~50 pc for massive, rapidly rotating planets. The implication of these results
is that the best candidates for detection of such internally-generated radio

non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference. We
demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle, known as

interference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The
disjunction effects, observed in experiments, are accurately predicted using a
theorem on interference alternation that we derive, which connects
aversion-to-uncertainty to the appearance of negative interference terms
suppressing the probability of actions. The conjunction fallacy is also
explained by the presence of the interference terms. A series of experiments

At present,
the major uncertainties are located at energies above $\sim 10^{19.5}$ eV, the
expected beginning of the GZK suppression. This is mainly due to the low
statistics available, a problem that will be addressed in unprecedented way by
the upcoming orbital detectors like JEM-EUSO. The detection of very high energy
photons is of great relevance for the understanding of the origin of this
extreme energy cosmic rays (EECR), due to the astrophysical information
content. However, their discrimination is an experimental challenge for current
and future cosmic ray detectors. In this work we study the statistical
separation between hadron and photon showers from space observations at
energies where both, the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect and
magnetospheric interactions are important for the development of the cascades.
We base our analysis on the $X_{max}$ parameter, which is already a well known
composition discrimination parameter for ground based fluorescence
observatories. Our analysis applies to orbiting detectors in general.
Nevertheless, we exemplify the practical utilization of our technique by
estimating a general upper limit to the photon fraction in the integral flux,
attainable by an ideal orbital detector with characteristics similar to
JEM-EUSO. In the process we describe the resultant asymmetry in the
photon-hadron discrimination efficiency in galactic coordinates.

and sometimes conflicting, aims in practice. For large samples, we show that a
satisfactory, likelihood-based general solution exists by using appropriate
forms of the relative Kullback--Leibler information, and that the proposed
measures are computationally inexpensive given the maximized likelihoods with
the observed data. Two measures are introduced, under the null and alternative
hypothesis respectively. We exemplify the measures on data coming from mapping
studies on the inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. For small-sample
problems, which appear rather frequently in practice and sometimes in disguised
forms (e.g., measuring individual contributions to a large study), the robust
Bayesian approach holds great promise, though the choice of a general-purpose
""default prior"" is a very challenging problem.

high-dimensional nonlinearity which is attributed to the delay-induced

In light of these facts, which adds enough confusion and diffusion properties
for secure communications, we explore the synchronization phenomena in
spatiotemporal semiconductor laser systems. The novel system is used in a
two-phase colored image encryption process. The high-dimensional chaotic
attractor generated by the system produces a completely randomized chaotic time
series, which is ideal in the secure encoding of messages. The scheme thus
illustrated is a two-phase encryption method, which provides sufficiently high
confusion and diffusion properties of chaotic cryptosystem employed with unique
data sets of processed chaotic sequences. In this novel method of cryptography,
the chaotic phase masks are represented as images using the chaotic sequences
as the elements of the image. The scheme drastically permutes the positions of
the picture elements. The next additional layer of security further alters the
statistical information of the original image to a great extent along the
three-color planes. The intermediate results during encryption demonstrate the
infeasibility for an unauthorized user to decipher the cipher image. Exhaustive
statistical tests conducted validate that the scheme is robust against noise
and resistant to common attacks due to the double shield of encryption and the
infinite dimensionality of the relevant system of partial differential
equations.

insensitive to the choice of CSFR models, but depends strongly on the evolving
behavior of CSFR at low redshifts. Our results show that the dimensionless
energy density $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}$ could have a peak amplitude of $\simeq
(1-3.5) \times10^{-8}$ in the frequency range $(200-1000)$~Hz. However, such a
high mode amplitude is unrealistic as it is known that the maximum value is
much smaller and at most $10^{-2}$. A realistic estimate of $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}$

to a pessimistic outlook for the detection of r-mode background. We consider
different pairs of terrestrial interferometers (IFOs) and compare two
approaches to combine multiple IFOs in order to evaluate the detectability of
this GW background. Constraints on the total emitted GW energy associated with
this mechanism to produce a detectable stochastic background are $\sim 10^{-3}

blackbox and efficient linear maps \phi that reduce the number of variables
from n to r but maintain trdeg{\phi(f_i)}_i = r, assuming f_i's sparse and
small r. We apply these fundamental maps to solve several cases of blackbox

poly(size(D))^r time.

  Belgium",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The powerful quantization formalism of Batalin and Vilkovisky streamlines the
derivation of the complete set of (non-linear) identities arising from the
local BRST symmetry of Yang-Mills theories. When applied in the Background
Field Method type of gauges, it also gives rise to identities which relate
Green's functions involving background fields to Green's functions involving
quantum fields. All these identities lie at the core of the recent progress in
understanding from the continuum formulation the IR dynamics emerging from
lattice simulations. In this talk, we will first review the Batalin-Vilkovisky
formalism and then apply it to the problem of extracting the effective charge
from the available lattice data.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.84.016218",,"nlin.CD math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Kolmogorov-Sinai (K-S) entropy is a central measure of complexity and
chaos. Its calculation for many-body systems is an interesting and important
challenge. In this paper, the evaluation is formulated by considering
$N$-dimensional symplectic maps and deriving a transfer matrix formalism for
the stability problem. This approach makes explicit a duality relation that is
exactly analogous to one found in a generalized Anderson tight-binding model,
and leads to a formally exact expression for the finite-time K-S entropy.
Within this formalism there is a hierarchy of approximations, the final one
being a diagonal approximation that only makes use of instantaneous Hessians of
the potential to find the K-S entropy. By way of a non-trivial illustration,
the K-S entropy of $N$ identically coupled kicked rotors (standard maps) is
investigated. The validity of the various approximations with kicking strength,
particle number, and time are elucidated. An analytic formula for the K-S
entropy within the diagonal approximation is derived and its range of validity
is also explored.

investigated. Building on the results of Bar-Yossef et al. (2006), the
properties of linear index codes are further explored. The notion of weak
security, considered by Bhattad and Narayanan (2005) in the context of network
coding, is generalized to block security. It is shown that the linear index
code based on a matrix $L$, whose column space code $C(L)$ has length $n$,
minimum distance $d$ and dual distance $d^\perp$, is $(d-1-t)$-block secure
(and hence also weakly secure) if the adversary knows in advance $t \leq d-2$
messages, and is completely insecure if the adversary knows in advance more
than $n - d$ messages. Strong security is examined under the conditions that
the adversary: (i) possesses $t$ messages in advance; (ii) eavesdrops at most
$\mu$ transmissions; (iii) corrupts at most $\delta$ transmissions. We prove
that for sufficiently large $q$, an optimal linear index code which is strongly
secure against such an adversary has length $\kappa_q+\mu+2\delta$. Here
$\kappa_q$ is a generalization of the min-rank over $F_q$ of the side
information graph for the ICSI problem in its original formulation in the work
of Bar- Yossef et al.

FPAs have many applications related to error correcting codes. In coding

that compute the ball size of frequency permutations under Chebyshev distance.
Both methods extend previous known results. The first one runs in $O({2d\lambda

product of the Cantor set ($X$) and torus ($\T^2$) and their corresponding
crossed product $C^*$-algebras.
  For the case when the cocycles are rotations, we studied the structure of the
crossed product $C^*$-algebra $A$ by looking at a large subalgebra $A_x$. It is
proved that, as long as the cocycles are rotations, the tracial rank of the
crossed product $C^*$-algebra is always no more than one, which then indicates
that it falls into the category of classifiable $C^*$-algebras.
  If a certain rigidity condition is satisfied, it is shown that the crossed
product $C^*$-algebra has tracial rank zero. Under this assumption, it is
proved that for two such dynamical systems, if $A$ and $B$ are the
corresponding crossed product $C^*$-algebras, and we have an isomorphism
between $K_i(A)$ and $K_i(B)$ which maps $K_i(C(X \times \T^2))$ to $K_i(C(X
\times \T^2))$, then these two dynamical systems are approximately
$K$-conjugate. The proof also indicates that $C^*$-strongly flip conjugacy
implies approximate $K$-conjugacy in this case.

realistic residual interaction is analyzed in the framework of the approach of
Refs. \cite{Rum98,Rodin05}. Both Gamow-Teller (GT) and Fermi (F) \bb-decay
amplitudes $M^{2\nu}$, along with the corresponding energy-weighted sum rules
$S$, are calculated. General expressions relating $S$ to a realistic residual
particle-particle interaction are derived, which show a pronounced sensitivity
of $S$ to the singlet-channel interaction in the case of F transitions, and to
the triplet-channel interaction in the case of GT transitions. Decompositions
of $M^{2\nu}$, as well as the monopole transition contributions to $M^{0\nu}$,
are obtained by the method of Refs. \cite{Rum98,Rodin05}. It is shown that in
most of the cases almost the whole dependence of $M^{2\nu}$ and $M^{0\nu}$ on
the particle-particle renormalization parameter $g_{pp}$ is accounted for by
the $g_{pp}$-dependence of the corresponding sum rules $S$. Thus, the
$g_{pp}$-sensitivity of calculated $M^{2\nu}$ and $M^{0\nu}$ is unavoidable
since it is dictated by the generic structure of the $\beta\beta$ amplitudes.
Finally, a better isospin-consistent way of a renormalization of the realistic
residual particle-particle interaction to use in QRPA calculations is
suggested.

ordinal constraints. The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for
ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due
to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed. The availability of
ordinal class labels, however, is often costly to calibrate or difficult to
obtain. Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater
abundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of
unlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for
ordinal regression in this paper, namely Transductive Ordinal Regression (TOR).
The key challenge of the present study lies in the precise estimation of both
the ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the
ordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include
an objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions
casted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label
swapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective
function value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used
benchmark datasets including the real world sentiment prediction problem are
then presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed
transductive ordinal regression. Further, comparisons to recent
state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods demonstrate the introduced
transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression led to the robust and
improved performance.

Already Cheng (1988) indicated that electroweak symmetry breaking, usually
attributed to the Higgs field with a boson expected at $0.1 - 0.3 \,TeV$, may
be due to a coupling between Weyl geometric gravity and electroweak
interactions. Weyl geometry seems to be well suited for treating questions of
elementary particle physics, which relate to scale invariance and its
""breaking"". This setting suggests the existence of a scalar field boson at the
surprisingly low energy of $\sim 1\, eV$. That may appear unlikely; but, as a
payoff, the acquirement of mass arises as a result of coupling to gravity in
agreement with the understanding of mass as the gravitational charge of fields.
