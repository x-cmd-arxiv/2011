hypothesis of a tiny contribution from a degenerate Fermi gas (DFG) test-fluid
to some dominant cosmological scenario are investigated. Reporting about the
systematic way of accounting for all the cosmological perturbations, through
the Boltzmann equation we obtain the analytical results for density
fluctuation, $\delta$, and fluid velocity divergence, $\theta$, of the DFG.
Small contributions to the matter power spectrum are analytically obtained for
the radiation-dominated background, through an ultra-relativistic
approximation, and for the matter-dominated and $\Lambda$-dominated eras,
through a non-relativistic approximation. The results can be numerically
reproduced and compared with those of considering non-relativistic and
ultra-relativistic neutrinos into the computation of the matter power spectrum.
Lessons concerning the formation of large scale structures of a DFG are
depicted, and consequent deviations from standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions for
the matter power spectrum (with and without neutrinos) are quantified.

elegant and use the only mechanism of spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry

scaling up from QCD. But it is ruled out on many counts: inappropriately low

scalar and vector states, etc. However, nature may not choose the minimal model

to abandon specific models (of strong EW breaking) and concentrate on generic

physical properties of a variety of astrophysical plasmas, including the upper

polarization signals whose modification via the Hanle effect may be exploited
for magnetic field diagnostics. Here we report on a basic theoretical
investigation of the linear polarization produced by scattering processes and
the Hanle effect in Ly-a, Ly-b and H-a taking into account multilevel radiative
transfer effects in an isothermal stellar atmosphere model, the fine-structure
of the hydrogen levels, as well as the impact of collisions with electrons and
protons. The main aim of this first paper is to elucidate the physical
mechanisms that control the linear polarization in the three lines, as well as
its sensitivity to the perturbers density and to the strength and structure of
micro-structured and deterministic magnetic fields. To this end, we apply an
efficient radiative transfer code we have developed for performing numerical
simulations of the Hanle effect in multilevel systems with overlapping line
transitions. For low density plasmas such as that of the upper solar
chromosphere collisional depolarization is caused mainly by collisional
transitions between the fine-structure levels of n=3, so that it is virtually
insignificant for Ly-a but important for Ly-b and H-a. We show the impact of
the Hanle effect on the three lines taking into account the radiative transfer
coupling between the different hydrogen line transitions. For example, we
demonstrate that the linear polarization profile of the H-a line is sensitive
to the presence of magnetic field gradients in the line core formation region
and that in solar-like chromospheres selective absorption of polarization
components does not play any significant role on the emergent scattering
polarization.

used to predict the behavior of quark-gluon plasmas in the nonperturbative

occasions, all inorganic scintillators (NaI, CsI, and BGO) of the two
subsystems detected significant gamma-ray signals lasting for >1 minute.
Neither of these two events were associated with any lightning. In both cases,
the gamma-ray energy spectra extend to 10 MeV, suggesting that the detected
gamma-rays are produced by relativistic electrons via bremsstrahlung. Assuming
that the initial photon spectrum at the source is expressed by a power-law
function,the observed photons can be interpreted as being radiated from a
source located at a distance of 290-560 m for the 2007 event and 110-690 m for
the 2008 one, both at 90% confidence level.Employing these photon spectra, the
number of relativistic electrons is estimated as 10^9 - 10^{11}. The estimation
generally agrees with those calculated based on the relativistic runaway
electron avalanche model. A GROWTH photon spectrum, summed over 3 individual
events including the present two events and another reported previously, has
similar features including a cut-off energy, to an averaged spectrum of

constraint on squark and gluino masses with the experimental limit on the b to

expected repulsive collisions due to the hard core boson constraint; and, also
collisions in which they ""pass through"" one another. In addition to confirming
the soliton status of both bright and dark solitary waves, our studies reveal a

unique Kaluza-Klein graviton spectrum that exhibits a ~ TeV mass gap followed
by a near continuum of narrow resonances that are separated from each other by

interact with the cell cytoskeleton. Some processes, such as the transport of
cargoes is achieved mainly by the action of individual motors. Other, such as
cell motility and division, require the cooperative work of many motors.
Collective motor dynamics can be quite complex and unexpected. One beautiful
example is the bidirectional (""back and forth"") motion of filaments which is
induced when the motors within a group exert forces in opposite directions.
This review tackles the puzzle emerging from a recent experimental work in
which it has been shown that the characteristic reversal times of the
bidirectional motion are practically independent of the number of motors. This
result is in a striking contradiction with existing theoretical models that
predict an exponential growth of the reversal times with the size of the
system. We argue that the solution to this puzzle may be the crosstalk between
the motors which is mediated by the elastic tensile stress that develops in the
cytoskeleton track. The crosstalk does not directly correlate the attachment
and detachment of the motors, which work independently of each other. However,
it highly accelerates their detachments by making the detachment rates system
size dependent.

real weight $\delta$ and differential operators acting on tensor densities,
whose real weights are designed by $\lambda$ and $\lambda+\delta$. The
existence and uniqueness of such a map has been proved by Duval, Lecomte and
Ovsienko for a generic weight $\delta$. Later, Silhan has determined the
critical values of $\delta$ for which unique existence is lost, and conjectured
that for those values of $\delta$ existence is lost for a generic weight
$\lambda$. We fully determine the cases of existence and uniqueness of the
conformally equivariant quantization in terms of the values of $\delta$ and
$\lambda$. Namely, (i) unique existence is lost if and only if there is a
nontrivial conformally invariant differential operator on the space of symbols
of weight $\delta$, and (ii) in that case the conformally equivariant
quantization exists only for a finite number of $\lambda$, corresponding to
nontrivial conformally invariant differential operators on $\lambda$-densities.
The assertion (i) is proved in the more general context of IFFT (or AHS)
equivariant quantization.

electroweak symmetry breaking by providing quantitative results on the
nonperturbative dynamics of candidate theories. For this programme to succeed,
it is crucial to identify the questions that are relevant for phenomenology,
and develop the tools that will provide robust answers to these questions. The
existence of a conformal window for nonsupersymmetric gauge theories, and its
characterization, is one of the phenomenologically important problems that can
be studied on the lattice. We summarize the recent results from studies of IR
fixed points by numerical simulations, discuss their current limitations, and

that the formalism of the pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics allows describing
the Dirac particles motion in arbitrary stationary gravitational fields.
Second, it is proved that using the Parker weight operator and the subsequent
transition to the \eta -representation gives the transformation of the
Schroedinger equation for nonstationary metric, when the evolution operator
becomes self-conjugate. The scalar products in the \eta -representation are
flat, which makes possible the use of a standard apparatus for the Hermitian
quantum mechanics. Based on the results of this paper the authors draw a
conclusion about solution of the problem of uniqueness and self-conjugacy of
Dirac Hamiltonians in arbitrary gravitational fields including those dependent
on time. The general approach is illustrated by the example of Dirac
Hamiltonians for several stationary metrics, as well as for the cosmologically
flat and the open Friedmann models.

the reduced lifetime of the molecules compared to the corresponding atomic
Rydberg states. In this letter we present an experimental study on the
lifetimes of the ^3\Sigma (5s-35s) molecule in its vibrational ground state and
in an excited state. We show that the lifetimes depends on the density of
ground state atoms and that this can be described in the frame of a classical
scattering between the molecules and ground state atoms. We also find that the
excited molecular state has an even more reduced lifetime compared to the
ground state which can be attributed to an inward penetration of the bound
atomic pair due to imperfect quantum reflection that takes place in the special
shape of the molecular potential.

interaction will develop the N\'eel antiferromagnetic order with varying block
spin moments. The metal-insulator transition with $U_{\rm MI}$ smaller than the

transition temperature (TC). Organic superconductors mainly have two families:
the quasi-one dimensional (TMTSF)2X and two dimensional (BEDT-TTF)2X (Ref. 1
and 2), in which TMTSF is tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (C10H12Se4) and
BEDT-TTF or ""ET"" is bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene (C10H8S8). One key
feature of the organic superconductors is that they have {\pi}-molecular
orbitals, and the {\pi}-electron can delocalize throughout the crystal giving
rise to metallic conductivity due to a {\pi}-orbital overlap between adjacent
molecules. The introduction of charge into C60 solids and graphites with
{\pi}-electron networks by doping to realize superconductivity has been
extensively reported3,4. Very recently, superconductivity in alkali-metal doped
picene with {\pi}-electron networks was reported5. Here we report the discovery
of superconductivity in potassium doped Phenanthrene with TC~5 K. TC increases
with increasing pressure, and the pressure of 1 GPa leads to an increase of 20%
in TC, suggesting that the potassium doped phenanthrene shows unconventional
superconductivity. Both phenanthrene and picene are polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and contain three and five fused benzene rings, respectively. The
ribbon of fused benzene rings is part of graphene. Therefore, the discovery of
superconductivity in K3Phenanthrene produces a novel broad class of
superconductors consisting of fused hydrocarbon benzene rings with
{\pi}-electron networks. The fact that TC increases from 5 K for KxPhenanthrene
with three benzene rings to 18 K for Kxpicene with five benzene rings suggests
that such organic hydrocarbons with long benzene rings is potential
superconductor with high TC.

causes mechanical forces (electrostriction), and as a result the heart deforms.
This paper analyses the physical origin of the deformation, and how significant
it is. Methods-We represent the heart as an anisotropic cylinder. This simple
geometry allows us to obtain analytical solutions for the potential, current
density, charge, stress, and strain. Results-Charge induced on the heart
surface in the presence of the electric field results in forces that deform the
heart. In addition, the anisotropy of cardiac tissue creates a charge density
throughout the tissue volume, leading to body forces. These two forces cause
the tissue to deform in a complicated manner, with the anisotropy suppressing
radial displacements in favor of tangential ones. Quantitatively, the
deformation of the tissue is small, although it may be significant when using
some imaging techniques that require the measurement of small displacements.
Conclusions-The anisotropy of cardiac tissue produces qualitatively new
mechanical behavior during a strong, defibrillation-strength electric shock.

full load conditions. A system of partial differential equations describing
heat and moisture transfer during drying copra in the solar greenhouse dryer
was developed and this system of non-linear partial differential equations was
solved numerically using the finite difference method (FDM). The numerical
solution was programmed in Compaq Visual FORTRAN version 6.5. The simulated
results reasonably agreed with the experimental data for solar drying copra.
