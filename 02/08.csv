explanation, as all Chandrasekhar-mass models have severe problems reproducing
them. Recently, it has been proposed that violent mergers of two white dwarfs
of 0.9 M_sun could lead to subluminous SNe Ia events that resemble 1991bg-like
SNe~Ia. Here we investigate whether this scenario still works for mergers of
two white dwarfs with a mass ratio smaller than one. We aim to determine the
range of mass ratios for which a detonation still forms during the merger, as
only those events will lead to a SN Ia. This range is an important ingredient
for population synthesis and one decisive point to judge the viability of the
scenario. In addition, we perform a resolution study of one of the models.
Finally we discuss the connection between violent white dwarf mergers with a
primary mass of 0.9 M_sun and 1991bg-like SNe Ia. The latest version of the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Gadget3 is used to evolve binary systems
with different mass ratios until they merge. We analyze the result and look for
hot spots in which detonations can form. We show that mergers of two white
dwarfs with a primary white dwarf mass of ~0.9 M_sun and a mass ratio larger
than about $0.8$ robustly reach the conditions we require to ignite a
detonation and thus produce thermonuclear explosions during the merger itself.
We also find that while our simulations do not yet completely resolve the hot
spots, increasing the resolution leads to conditions that are even more likely
to ignite detonations. (abridged)

can be thought of as a minimal supersymmetric five dimensional theory

worldsheet and penta-brane instantons as well as (unoriented) D-brane
instantons and threshold corrections to BPS-saturated couplings in superstring
theories. We consider non-perturbative superpotentials generated by `gauge' and
`exotic' instantons living on D3-branes at orientifold singularities. We also
discuss the interplay between worldsheet and D-string instantons on T^4/Z_2. We
focus on a 4-fermi amplitude and offer a multi D-string instanton

instantons there. We concentrate on AdS4/CFT3 correspondence. We revisit
Kaluza-Klein compactification of 11-d supergravity on S^7/Z_k using group
theory techniques that may find application in other flux vacua with internal
coset spaces. Among the SO(2) neutral states, we identify marginal deformations

IIA on CP^3. We also discuss charged states, dual to monopole operators, and
the Z_k projection of the Osp(8|4) singleton and its tensor products. We show

approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed,
an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been
demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard
general tests on a broad range of materials are lacking. Here we calculate the
lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids
using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the
original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it
overestimates binding distances for gas phase dimers. However, some of the
modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of
PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than
from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported
here are for ""hard"" solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces
are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive
properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when non-local correlations

information on the nuclear medium, in particular on its Equation of State. The
interplay between laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations are

short as few minutes. The source shows the shortest recurrence time ever
observed from a neutron star. Here we present a study of the morphological,
spectral and temporal properties of 107 of the bursts observed by the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer. The recurrence time and the fluence of the bursts
clearly anticorrelate with the increase of the persistent X-ray flux. The ratio
between the energy generated by the accretion of mass and that liberated during
bursts indicate that Helium is ignited in a Hydrogen rich layer. Therefore we
conclude that all the bursts shown by IGR J17480-2446 are Type-I X-Ray bursts.
Pulsations could be detected in all the brightest bursts and no drifts of the
frequency are observed within 0.25 Hz of the spin frequency of the neutron
star. These are also phase locked with respect to the pulsations observed
during the persistent emission and no rise of the rms associated to the pulse
frequency is observed during the burst. This behavior would favor a scenario
where the flash is ignited within a region which is consistent to be as large
as the neutron star surface.

configuration is studied. This setup allows light entering the resonator setup
from a tapered fiber to evolve along a variety of different pathways before
leaving again through the fiber. In particular, the loop configuration of the
resonators allows for an evolution which we term roundtrip process, in which
the light evolves from one resonator sequentially through all others back to
the initial one. This process renders the optical properties of the system
sensitive to the phases of all coupling and scattering constants in the system.
We analyze the transmission and reflection spectra, and interpret them in terms
of interference between the various possible evolution pathways through the
resonator system. In particular, we focus on the phase dependence of the
optical properties. Finally, we discuss possible applications for this phase
sensitivity induced by the roundtrip process, such as the measurement of the
position of a nanoparticle close to one of the resonators, and the measurement
of changes in the refractive index between two resonators. Our analytical
results for the applications are supported by proof-of-principle calculations

Such forces are the basis for the medium-mediated Casimir-like force. To study
these forces beyond thermal average, it is necessary to define them in each
microstate of the medium. Two different definitions of these forces are
currently used in the literature. We study the assumptions underlying them. We
show that only the definition that uses the stress tensor of the medium gives
the sought-after force exerted by the medium on an embedded inclusion. If a
second inclusion is embedded in the medium, the thermal average of this force
gives the usual Casimir-like force between the two inclusions. The other
definition can be used in the different physical case of an object that
interacts with the medium without being embedded in it. We show in a simple
example that the two definitions yield different results for the variance of
the Casimir-like force.

find binaries composed of stars that bracket the expected boundary between
partially and fully convective interiors, which will allow the measurement of
the stellar mass-radius relationship across this transition. The majority of
our contact systems have short orbital periods, with small variance (0.02 days)
in the sample near the observed cutoff of 0.22 days. The accumulation of these
stars at short orbital period suggests that the process of angular momentum
loss, leading to period evolution, becomes less efficient at short periods.

independence of Hintikka and Sandu and Vaananen, and their compositional
semantics due to Hodges. We show how Hodges' semantics can be seen as a special
case of a general construction, which provides a context for a useful
completeness theorem with respect to a wider class of models. We shed some new
light on each aspect of the logic. We show that the natural propositional logic
carried by the semantics is the logic of Bunched Implications due to Pym and
O'Hearn, which combines intuitionistic and multiplicative connectives. This
introduces several new connectives not previously considered in logics of
informational dependence, but which we show play a very natural role, most
notably intuitionistic implication. As regards the quantifiers, we show that
their interpretation in the Hodges semantics is forced, in that they are the
image under the general construction of the usual Tarski semantics; this
implies that they are adjoints to substitution, and hence uniquely determined.
As for the dependence predicate, we show that this is definable from a simpler
predicate, of constancy or dependence on nothing. This makes essential use of
the intuitionistic implication. The Armstrong axioms for functional dependence
are then recovered as a standard set of axioms for intuitionistic implication.
We also prove a full abstraction result in the style of Hodges, in which the
intuitionistic implication plays a very natural r\^ole.

several 2-strip Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in the frequency range
$f=0.1-3.5$GHz. Such a range was chosen to fully cover the bandwidth associated
to the very short rise-times of signals originated in RPCs used for sub-100ps
timing applications. This work conveys experimental evidence of the dominant
role of modal dispersion in counters built at the 1 meter scale, a fact that
results in large cross-talk levels and strong signal shaping. It is shown that
modal dispersion appears in RPCs due to the intrinsic unbalance between the
capacitive and the inductive coupling $C_m/C_o \neq L_m/L_o$. A practical way
to restore this symmetry has been introduced (hereafter `electrostatic
compensation'), allowing for a cross-talk suppression factor of around $\times
12$ and a rise-time reduction by 200ps. Under conditions of compensation the
signal transmission is only limited by dielectric losses, yielding a
length-dependent cutoff frequency of around 1GHz per 2 meter for typical float
glass -based RPCs ($\tan \delta|_{glass} = 0.025\pm0.005$).
  It is further shown that
  `electrostatic compensation' can be achieved for an arbitrary number of
strips as long as the nature of the coupling is `short-range', that is an
almost exact assumption for typical strip-line RPCs. Evidence for deviations
from the dominant TEM propagation mode has been observed, although they seem to
have negligible influence in practical signal observables. This work extends
the bandwidth of previous studies by a factor of almost $\times 20$.

accurate densitometer for the active star formation environments found in

well-established technique of using the relative intensities of the (1,1),
(2,2), and (4,4) transitions of NH3 to derive the kinetic temperature in

spatial density in our starburst galaxy sample represent the first mean density
measurements made toward starburst galaxies. We note a disparity between
kinetic temperature measurements derived assuming direct coupling to dust and
those derived from our NH3 measurements which points to the absolute need for
direct gas kinetic temperature measurements using an appropriate molecular

initially receives a noisy observation of the true state of the world. The
agents then repeatedly 'vote' and observe the votes of some of their peers,
from which they gain more information. The agents' calculations are Bayesian
and aim to myopically maximize the expected utility at each iteration.
  This model, introduced by Gale and Kariv (2003), is a natural approach to
learning on networks. However, it has been criticized, chiefly because the
agents' decision rule appears to become computationally intractable as the
number of iterations advances. For instance, a dynamic programming approach
(part of this work) has running time that is exponentially large in \min(n,
(d-1)^t), where n is the number of agents.
  We provide a new algorithm to perform the agents' computations on locally
tree-like graphs. Our algorithm uses the dynamic cavity method to drastically
reduce computational effort. Let d be the maximum degree and t be the iteration
number. The computational effort needed per agent is exponential only in O(td)
(note that the number of possible information sets of a neighbor at time t is
itself exponential in td).
  Under appropriate assumptions on the rate of convergence, we deduce that each
agent is only required to spend polylogarithmic (in 1/\eps) computational
effort to approximately learn the true state of the world with error
probability \eps, on regular trees of degree at least five. We provide
numerical and other evidence to justify our assumption on convergence rate.
  We extend our results in various directions, including loopy graphs. Our
results indicate efficiency of iterative Bayesian social learning in a wide

this is possible within a special subset called stable parallel looped (SPL)
dynamical systems. I identify a new infinite family of physical and chemical
dynamical SPL systems, which are (a) easy to create naturally and (b) easy to
merge, link and combine to create dynamical systems of any specified
complexity. Within SPL systems, I propose a special collection of designs
called active material-energy looped systems using which it is possible to
generate large-scale ordered chemical networks, like the metabolic networks, in
a reliable, repeatable, iterative and natural manner. The resulting SPL systems
provide a new theoretical framework for the problem of origin of life.

density we have determined the evolution of the average star formation rate
(SFR) of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, unbiased from effects of dust
but also source confusion due to the 1.5"" angular resolution achieved by the
VLA. We find a power-law relation between specific SFR (SSFR) and stellar mass
for star forming galaxies out to z=3. While higher mass systems exhibit lower
SSFRs at any epoch, no differential, more rapid evolution of high mass galaxies
is evident at least out to z~1.5 where our conclusions are most robust.
Utilizing measured mass functions of star forming systems, the characteristic
stellar mass for galaxies contributing most to the comoving SFR density appears
not to evolve. These findings hence challenge 'downsizing' scenarios in which
star formation has gradually shifted towards lower mass systems with cosmic
time. Our analysis constitutes the to-date best determination of the cosmic
star formation history (CSFH) since z=3 and yields indirect evidence for a
rapid decline of the global mass density of molecular gas with time.

at least 3 of the 11 AGNs in our sample have observed SEDs that are
AGN-dominated even at 60 um, demonstrating the importance of accounting for
possible AGN contribution even at far-infrared wavelengths. Our results also
suggest that the average intrinsic AGN 6-100 um SED gets bluer with increasing
X-ray luminosity, a trend seen both within our sample and also when we compare
against the intrinsic SEDs of more luminous quasars (i.e., Lx>10^{44} ergs/s).
We compare our intrinsic AGN SEDs with predictions from dusty torus models and
find they are more closely matched by clumpy, rather than continuous, torus

factors to convert either monochromatic infrared or X-ray luminosities into
total intrinsic AGN infrared (i.e., 8-1000 um) luminosities. Finally, we
outline a procedure that uses our newly defined intrinsic AGN infrared SEDs, in
conjunction with a selection of host-galaxy templates, to fit the infrared
photometry of composite galaxies and measure the AGN contribution to their
total infrared output. We verify the accuracy of our SED fitting procedure by
comparing our results to two independent measures of AGN contribution. Our SED
fitting procedure opens up the possibility of measuring the intrinsic AGN

profile of massive early-type galaxies. Furthermore, the satellite distribution
is highly anisotropic (isotropy is ruled out at a >99.99% confidence level).
Defining phi to be the offset between the major axis of the satellite spatial
distribution and the major axis of the host light profile, we find a maximum

string theorists and mathematicians. Recently it was pointed out that one of
the generic degenerations of these spaces (occurring at codimension one in
moduli space) is an isolated singularity which is a finite cyclic quotient of
the conifold; these were called hyperconifolds. It was also shown that if the
order of the quotient group is even, such singular varieties have projective
crepant resolutions, which are therefore smooth Calabi-Yau manifolds. The
resulting topological transitions were called hyperconifold transitions, and
change the fundamental group as well as the Hodge numbers. Here Batyrev's
construction of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric fourfolds is used to
demonstrate that certain compact examples containing the remaining
hyperconifolds - the Z_3 and Z_5 cases - also have Calabi-Yau resolutions. The
mirrors of the resulting transitions are studied and it is found, surprisingly,
that they are ordinary conifold transitions. These are the first examples of
conifold transitions with mirrors which are more exotic extremal transitions.
The new hyperconifold transitions are also used to construct a small number of
new Calabi-Yau manifolds, with small Hodge numbers and fundamental group Z_3 or
Z_5. Finally, it is demonstrated that a hyperconifold is a physically sensible
background in Type IIB string theory. In analogy to the conifold case,
non-perturbative dynamics smooth the physical moduli space, such that
hyperconifold transitions correspond to non-singular processes in the full
theory.

a rare glimpse of these otherwise dormant beasts. It has long been predicted
that the disruption will be accompanied by a thermal `flare', powered by the
accretion of bound stellar debris. Several candidate disruptions have been
discovered in this manner at optical, UV and X-ray wavelengths. Here we explore
the observational consequences if a modest fraction of the accretion power is
channeled into an ultra-relativistic outflow. We show that a relativistic jet
decelerates due to its interaction with the interstellar medium at sub-parsec
distances from the black hole. Synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated
by the reverse shock powers a bright radio-infrared transient that peaks on a
timescale ~1 yr after disruption. Emission from the forward shock may be
detectable for several years after the peak. Deep radio follow-up observations
of tidal disruption candidates at late times can test for the presence of
relativistic ejecta. Upcoming radio transient surveys may independently
discover tens to hundreds of tidal disruptions per year, complimenting searches
at other wavelengths. Non-thermal emission from tidal disruption probes the
physics of jet formation under relatively clean conditions, in which the flow
parameters are independently constrained.

resonances with Neptune. This dynamical configuration likely resulted from
resonance capture as Neptune migrated outward during the late stages of planet
formation. The details of Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, including
its radial extent and the concurrent eccentricity evolution of the planet, are
the subject of considerable debate. Two qualitatively different proposals for
resonance capture have been proposed--migration-induced capture driven by
smooth outward evolution of Neptune's orbit and chaotic capture driven by
damping of the planet's eccentricity near its current semi-major axis. We
demonstrate that the distribution of comparable-mass, wide-separation binaries
occupying resonant orbits can differentiate between these two scenarios. If
migration-induced capture occurred, this fraction records information about the
formation locations of different populations of KBOs. Chaotic capture, in
contrast, randomizes the orbits of bodies as they are placed in resonance. In
particular, migration-induced capture produces the following signatures. The
2:1 resonance should contain a dynamically cold component, with inclinations
less than 5-10 degrees, having a binary fraction comparable to that among cold
classical KBOs. If the 3:2 resonance also hosts a cold component, its binary
fraction should be 20-30% lower than in the cold classical belt. Among cold 2:1
(and if present 3:2) KBOs, objects with eccentricities e < 0.2 should have a
binary fraction ~20% larger than those with e > 0.2. Searches for cold
components in the binary fractions of resonant KBOs are currently practical.
The additional migration-generated trends described here may be distinguished
with objects discovered by LSST. (Abstract abridged.)

Similar to the HOD of galaxies/subhalos, we find that the black hole occupation
number can be described by the form N_BH proportional to 1+ (M_Host)^alpha
where alpha evolves mildly with redshift indicating that a given mass halo
(M_Host) at low redshift tends to host fewer BHs than at high redshift (as
expected as a result of galaxy and BH mergers). We further divide the
occupation number into contributions from black holes residing in central and
satellite galaxies within a halo. The distribution of M_BH within halos tends
to consist of a single massive BH (distributed about a peak mass strongly
correlated with M_Host), and a collection of relatively low-mass secondary BHs,
with weaker correlation with M_Host. We also examine the spatial distribution
of BHs within their host halos, and find they typically follow a power-law
radial distribution (i.e. much more centrally concentrated than the subhalo
distribution). Finally, we characterize the host mass for which BH growth is
feedback dominated (e.g. star formation quenched). We show that halos with
M_Host > 3 * 10^12 M_sun have primary BHs that are feedback dominated by z~3

expansion. Including these J terms explicitly allows us to enhance the strength
of the (pi, 0)-(0, pi) spin order which favors the presence of tightly bound
pairing states even in the small clusters that are here exactly diagonalized.
The A1g and B2g pairing symmetries are found to compete in the realistic
spin-ordered and metallic regime. The dynamical pairing susceptibility
additionally unveils low-lying B1g states, suggesting that small changes in

those at larger radii. We investigate the idea that these central starbursts
are self-regulated, with the momentum flux injected to the ISM by star
formation balancing the gravitational force confining the gas. For most
starbursts, supernovae are the largest contributor to the momentum flux, and
turbulence provides the main pressure support for the predominantly-molecular
ISM. If the momentum feedback per stellar mass formed is p_*/m_* ~ 3000 km/s,
the predicted star formation rate is Sigma_SFR=2 pi G Sigma^2 m_*/p_*
~0.1(Sigma/100Msun/pc^2)^2 Msun/kpc^2/yr in regions where gas dominates the
vertical gravity. We compare this prediction with numerical simulations of
vertically-resolved disks that model star formation including feedback, finding
good agreement for gas surface densities Sigma ~ 10^2-10^3 Msun/pc^2. We also
compare to a compilation of star formation rates and gas contents from local
and high-redshift galaxies (both mergers and normal galaxies), finding good
agreement provided that X_CO decreases weakly as Sigma and Sigma_SFR increase.
Star formation rates in dense, turbulent gas are also expected to depend on the
gravitational free-fall time; if the efficiency per free-fall time is
epsilon_ff ~ 0.01, the turbulent velocity dispersion driven by feedback is
expected to be v_z = 0.4 epsilon_ff p_*/m_* ~ 10 km/s, relatively independent
of Sigma or Sigma_SFR. Turbulence-regulated starbursts (controlled by kinetic
momentum feedback) are part of the larger scheme of self-regulation;
primarily-atomic low-Sigma outer disks may have star formation regulated by UV
heating feedback, whereas regions at extremely high Sigma may be regulated by
feedback of radiation that is reprocessed into trapped IR.

sharp contrast to the case of charge pumping in a normal double barrier

different types of superfluid states. Our interest is in superfluid mixtures
comprising particles with different statistics- Bose and Fermi. Such scenarios
occur naturally, for example, in dense QCD matter. Interestingly, cold atomic
experiments are performed in traps with finite spatial extent, thus critically
destabilizing the occurrence of various homogeneous phases. Critical to this
analysis is the understanding that the trapped system can undergo phase
separation, resulting in a unique situation where phase transition in either
species (bosons or fermions) can overlap with the phase separation between
possible phases. In the present work, we illustrate how this intriguing
interplay manifests in an interacting 2-species atomic mixture - one bosonic
and another fermionic with two spin components - within a realistic trap
configuration. We further show that such interplay of transitions can render
the nature of the ground state to be highly sensitive to the experimental
parameters and the dimensionality of the system.

that they all have a thermonuclear origin, despite the fact that many do not
show the canonical spectral softening along the decay imprinted on type I X-ray
bursts by the cooling of the neutron star photosphere. We show that the

accretion-to-thermonuclear efficiency ratio along the whole outburst, as is
typical for type I X-ray bursts. The burst energy, peak luminosity and
daily-averaged spectral profiles all evolve smoothly throughout the outburst,
in parallel with the persistent (non-burst) luminosity. We also find that the
peak burst to persistent luminosity ratio determines whether or not cooling is
present in the bursts from IGR J17480-2446, and argue that the apparent lack of
cooling is due to the ""non-cooling"" bursts having both a lower peak temperature
and a higher non-burst (persistent) emission. We conclude that the detection of
cooling along the decay is a sufficient, but not a necessary condition to
identify an X-ray burst as thermonuclear. Finally, we compare these findings

are derived from simple and reasonable assumptions. Efficient numerical
algorithms are presented for solving these equations. The obtained artificial
prediction market is shown to be a maximum likelihood estimator. It generalizes
linear aggregation, existent in boosting and random forest, as well as logistic
regression and some kernel methods. Furthermore, the market mechanism allows
the aggregation of specialized classifiers that participate only on specific
instances. Experimental comparisons show that the artificial prediction markets
often outperform random forest and implicit online learning on synthetic data
and real UCI datasets. Moreover, an extensive evaluation for pelvic and
abdominal lymph node detection in CT data shows that the prediction market
improves adaboost's detection rate from 79.6% to 81.2% at 3 false
positives/volume.

network scheduling algorithm, which is motivated by the celebrated simplex
algorithm for solving linear programming (LP) problems. The scheduler stores a
sparse set of basic schedules, and chooses the max-weight basic schedule for
transmission in each time slot. At the same time, the scheduler tries to update
the set of basic schedules by searching for a new basic schedule in a
throughput increasing direction. We show that both of the above procedures can
be achieved in a distributed manner. Specifically, we propose an average
consensus based link contending algorithm to implement the distributed max
weight scheduling. Further, we show that the basic schedule update can be
implemented using CSMA mechanisms, which is similar to the one proposed by
Jiang et al. Compared to the optimal distributed scheduler in Jiang's paper,
where schedules change in a random walk fashion, our algorithm has a better
delay performance by achieving faster schedule transitions in the steady state.
The performance of the algorithm is finally confirmed by simulation results.

correlation with HI column density as well as total and gas-phase metal column

average change in the spectral index of delta_beta=0.51 with a standard
deviation of 0.02. This is consistent with the expectation from a simple
synchrotron model. Of the sample, 63% are well described by the SMC-type
extinction curve and have moderate or low extinction, with AV<0.65. Almost a
quarter of our sample is consistent with no significant extinction (typically
AV<0.1). The 2175AA extinction bump is detected unequivocally in 7% of our

gas-to-dust ratio and metallicity consistent with the Local Group relation. Our
metals-to-dust ratios derived from the soft X-ray absorption are always larger
(3-30 times) than the Local Group value, which may mean that GRB hosts may be
less efficient at turning their metals into dust. However, we find that gas,
dust, and metal column densities are all likely to be influenced by
photo-ionization and dust destruction effects from the GRB. [abridged]

intersection with each set in the collection; the hitting set problem is to
find a hitting set of minimum cardinality. Motivated by instances of the
hitting set problem where the number of sets to be hit is large, we introduce
the notion of implicit hitting set problems. In an implicit hitting set problem
the collection of sets to be hit is typically too large to list explicitly;
instead, an oracle is provided which, given a set H, either determines that H
is a hitting set or returns a set that H does not hit. We show a number of
examples of classic implicit hitting set problems, and give a generic algorithm
for solving such problems optimally. The main contribution of this paper is to
show that this framework is valuable in developing approximation algorithms. We
illustrate this methodology by presenting a simple on-line algorithm for the
minimum feedback vertex set problem on random graphs. In particular our
algorithm gives a feedback vertex set of size n-(1/p)\log{np}(1-o(1)) with
probability at least 3/4 for the random graph G_{n,p} (the smallest feedback
vertex set is of size n-(2/p)\log{np}(1+o(1))). We also consider a planted
model for the feedback vertex set in directed random graphs. Here we show that
a hitting set for a polynomial-sized subset of cycles is a hitting set for the
planted random graph and this allows us to exactly recover the planted feedback
vertex set.

is an important task in mathematics and the natural sciences. It has a rich
history dating back to the early 19th century when Carl Friedrich Gauss
developed the method of least squares of a system of linear equations - its
solutions can be viewed as fixed points of averaged projections onto
hyperplanes. A powerful generalization of this problem is to find fixed points
of averaged resolvents (i.e., firmly nonexpansive mappings).
  This paper concerns the relationship between the set of fixed points of

It partially extends recent work for two mappings on a question of C. Byrne.
The analysis suggests a reformulation in a product space.
  Furthermore, two new algorithms are presented. A complete convergence proof

the linear-programming (LP) decoder for binary linear codes is extended to JD
of binary-input FSCs. In particular, we provide a rigorous definition of LP
joint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the
pairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs in AWGN. This leads
naturally to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the
channel is a finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the joint LP
decoder also has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all
integer-valued solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss
relative to ML decoding can be explained completely by fractional-valued
JD-PCWs. After deriving these results, we discovered some elements were
equivalent to earlier work by Flanagan on LP receivers.
  In the second part, we develop an efficient iterative solver for the joint LP
decoder discussed in the first part. In particular, we extend the approach of
iterative approximate LP decoding, proposed by Vontobel and Koetter and
analyzed by Burshtein, to this problem. By taking advantage of the dual-domain
structure of the JD-LP, we obtain a convergent iterative algorithm for joint LP
decoding whose structure is similar to BCJR-based turbo equalization (TE). The
result is a joint iterative decoder whose per-iteration complexity is similar
to that of TE but whose performance is similar to that of joint LP decoding.
The main advantage of this decoder is that it appears to provide the
predictability of joint LP decoding and superior performance with the
computational complexity of TE. One expected application is coding for magnetic
storage where the required block-error rate is extremely low and system
performance is difficult to verify by simulation.

directly comparing ""observationally"" derived values with ""actual"" values from

Previous studies are
concentrated on a static rumor spreading. The content of the rumor is
invariable during the whole spreading process. Indeed, the rumor evolves
constantly in its spreading process, which grows shorter, more concise, more
easily grasped and told. In an early psychological experiment, researchers
found about 70% of details in a rumor were lost in the first 6 mouth-to-mouth
transmissions \cite{TPR}. Based on the facts, we investigate rumor spreading on
social networks, where the content of the rumor is modified by the individuals
with a certain probability. In the scenario, they have two choices, to forward
or to modify. As a forwarder, an individual disseminates the rumor directly to
its neighbors. As a modifier, conversely, an individual revises the rumor
before spreading it out. When the rumor spreads on the social networks, for
instance, scale-free networks and small-world networks, the majority of
individuals actually are infected by the multi-revised version of the rumor, if
the modifiers dominate the networks. Our observation indicates that the
original rumor may lose its influence in the spreading process. Similarly, a
true information may turn to be a rumor as well. Our result suggests the rumor
evolution should not be a negligible question, which may provide a better
understanding of the generation and destruction of a rumor.

for density modeling, visualisation and exploratory data analysis, is also
increasingly important for learning features relevant to discriminative tasks.
Autoencoders, in particular, have proven to be an effective way to learn latent
codes that reflect meaningful variations in data. A continuing challenge,
however, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for
particular tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are invariant
to irrelevant transformations of the data. The most common way of introducing
such problem-specific guidance in autoencoders has been through the
incorporation of a parametric component that ties the latent representation to
the label information. In this work, we argue that a preferable approach relies
instead on a nonparametric guidance mechanism. Conceptually, it ensures that
there exists a function that can predict the label information, without
explicitly instantiating that function. The superiority of this guidance
mechanism is confirmed on two datasets. In particular, this approach is able to
incorporate invariance information (lighting, elevation, etc.) from the small

Cygnus Loop is an evolved ($\sim$10,000 yr) supernova remnant whose temperature
is relatively low ($<$1 keV) compared with other young remnants, its spectrum
is generally faint above 3.0 keV, no emission lines, such as the Ar-K line have
ever been detected. The detection of the Ar-K line is the first time and we
found that its abundance is significantly higher than that of the solar value;

coexisting with a secondary link of one transmitter and a corresponding
receiver. The rate region depicts the sum primary rate versus the secondary
rate and is established assuming that the secondary link performs
rate-splitting. The achievable rate region is the union of two types of
achievable rate regions. The first type is a rate region established assuming
that the secondary receiver cannot decode any primary signal, whereas the
second is established assuming that the secondary receiver can decode the
signal of one primary receiver. The achievable rate region is determined first
assuming discrete memoryless channel (DMC) then the results are applied to a
Gaussian channel. In the Gaussian channel, the performance of rate-splitting is
characterized for the two types of rate regions. Moreover, a necessary and
sufficient condition to determine which primary signal that the secondary
receiver can decode without degrading the range of primary achievable sum rates
is provided. When this condition is satisfied by a certain primary user, the
secondary receiver can decode its signal and achieve larger rates without
reducing the primary achievable sum rates from the case in which it does not
decode any primary signal. It is also shown that, the probability of having at
least one primary user satisfying this condition grows with the primary signal

central engine in core-collapse explosions. Unlike supermassive black holes,
the spin of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems is little affected
by accretion, and accurately reflects the spin set at birth. A modest number of
stellar-mass black hole angular momenta have now been measured using two
independent X-ray spectroscopic techniques. In contrast, rotation-powered
pulsars spin-down over time, via magnetic braking, but a modest number of natal
spin periods have now been estimated. For both canonical and extreme neutron
star parameters, statistical tests strongly suggest that the angular momentum
distributions of black holes and neutron stars are markedly different. Within
the context of prevalent models for core-collapse supernovae, the angular
momentum distributions are consistent with black holes typically being produced
in GRB-like supernovae with jets, and with neutron stars typically being
produced in supernovae with too little angular momentum to produce jets via
magnetohydrodynamic processes. It is possible that neutron stars are imbued
with high spin initially, and rapidly spun-down shortly after the supernova
event, but the available mechanisms may be inconsistent with some observed

not appropriate for most P2P multimedia sharing networks due to the unique
features exhibited by such networks: large populations of anonymous agents
interacting infrequently, asymmetric interests of peers, network errors, and
multiple concurrent transactions. In this paper, we design and rigorously
analyze a new family of incentive protocols that utilizes indirect reciprocity
which is based on the design of efficient social norms. In the proposed P2P
protocols, the social norms consist of a social strategy, which represents the
rule prescribing to the peers when they should or should not provide content to
other peers, and a reputation scheme, which rewards or punishes peers depending
on whether they comply or not with the social strategy. We first define the
concept of a sustainable social norm, under which no peer has an incentive to
deviate. We then formulate the problem of designing optimal social norms, which
selects the social norm that maximizes the network performance among all
sustainable social norms. Hence, we prove that it becomes in the self-interest
of peers to contribute their content to the network rather than to free-ride.
We also investigate the impact of various punishment schemes on the social
welfare as well as how should the optimal social norms be designed if
altruistic and malicious peers are active in the network. Our results show that
optimal social norms are capable of providing significant improvements in the
sharing efficiency of multimedia P2P networks.

derived the center-of-mass proper motion (CMPM) of the Large Magellanic Cloud

effects in deriving the proper motion for each of the sampled fields, they did
not consider the effects of local random motion in the derivation. This means
that the average PM of the fields (i.e., the observed CMPM) could significantly
deviate from the true CMPM, because the effect of local random motion can not
be close to zero in making the average PM for the small number of the fields
(~10). We discuss how significantly the observationally derived CMPM can
deviate from the true CMPM by applying the same method as used in the
observations for a dynamical model of the LMC with a known true CMPM. We find
that the deviation can be as large as ~ 50 km/s (~0.21 mas/yr), if the LMC has
a thick disk and a maximum circular velocity of ~120$ km/s. We also find that
the deviation depends both on the total number of the sampled fields and on
structure and kinematics of the LMC. We therefore suggest that there is a
possibility that the observed CMPM of the LMC deviates from the true one to
some extent. We also show that a simple mean of PM for a large number of the
LMC fields (~1000) can be much closer to the true CMPM.

are useful in understanding and protecting humans from such injury. Because
traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to blast exposure has become a prominent
medical and military problem, similar thresholds should be identified that can
put available research results in context and guide future research toward
protecting warfighters as well as diagnosis and treatment. At least three
mechanical mechanisms by which the blast wave may result in brain injury have
been proposed - a thoracic mechanism, head acceleration and direct cranial
transmission. These mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive. In this study,
likely regions of interest for the first two mechanisms based on blast
characteristics (positive pulse duration and peak effective overpressure) are
developed using available data from blast experiments and related studies,
including behind-armor blunt trauma and ballistic pressure wave studies. These
related studies are appropriate to include because blast-like pressure waves
are produced that result in neurological effects like those caused by blast.
Results suggest that injury thresholds for each mechanism are dependent on
blast conditions, and that under some conditions, more than one mechanism may
contribute. There is a subset of blast conditions likely to result in TBI due
to head acceleration and/or a thoracic mechanism without concomitant lung
injury. These results can be used to guide experimental designs and compare
additional data as they become available. Additional data are needed before
actual probabilities or severity of TBI for a given exposure can be described.

only dust absorption into account fails in matching the observational data,

indicating that even for the extremely good energy resolutions reported here,
the achievable energy resolutions are largely determined by the properties of

Specifically, we construct a set of network representations (""replicas"") of the
physical system based on interatomic potentials and apply a multiscale
clustering (""multiresolution community detection"") analysis using
information-based correlations among the replicas. Replicas may be (i)
different representations of an identical static system or (ii) embody dynamics
by when considering replicas to be time separated snapshots of the system (with
a tunable time separation) or (iii) encode general correlations when different
replicas correspond to different representations of the entire history of the
system as it evolves in space-time. We apply our method to computer simulations
of a binary Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones system, a ternary model system, and to
atomic coordinates in a ZrPt system as gleaned by reverse Monte Carlo analysis
of experimentally determined structure factors. We identify the dominant
structures (disjoint or overlapping) and general length scales by analyzing
extrema of the information theory measures. We speculate on possible links
between (i) physical transitions or crossovers and (ii) changes in structures
found by this method as well as phase transitions associated with the
computational complexity of the community detection problem. We briefly also
consider continuum approaches and discuss the shear penetration depth in
elastic media; this length scale increases as the system becomes increasingly
rigid.

commutative ring $R$ and studied a dominance relation $\phi \geq \psi$ between
supervaluations $\phi$ and $\psi$ on $R$, aiming at an enrichment of the
algebraic tool box for use in tropical geometry.
  A supervaluation $\phi:R \to U$ is a multiplicative map from $R$ to a
supertropical semiring $U$, cf. [IR1], [IR2], [IKR1], with further properties,
which mean that $\phi$ is a sort of refinement, or covering, of an m-valuation
(= monoid valuation) $v: R \to M$. In the most important case, that $R$ is a
ring, m-valuations constitute a mild generalization of valuations in the sense
of Bourbaki [B], while $\phi \geq \psi$ means that $\psi: R \to V$ is a sort of
coarsening of the supervaluation $\phi$. If $\phi(R)$ generates the semiring
$U$, then $\phi \geq \psi$ iff there exists a ""transmission"" $\alpha: U \to V$
with $\psi = \alpha \circ \phi$.
  Transmissions are multiplicative maps with further properties, cf. [IKR1,
Sec. 5]. Every semiring homomorphism $\alpha: U \to V$ is a transmission, but
there are others which lack additivity, and this causes a major difficulty. In
the main body of the paper we study surjective transmissions via equivalence
relations on supertropical semirings, often much more complicated than
congruences by ideals in usual commutative algebra.

exploits the feature of large wavelet coefficient variance to achieve the goal
of high capacity with imperceptibility. Our method differs from those of
previous ones in which the wavelet coefficients histogram not gray-level
histogram is manipulated. Besides, clever shifting rules are introduced into
histogram to avoid the decimal problem in pixel values after recovery to
achieve reversibility. With small alteration of the wavelet coefficients in the
embedding process, and therefore low visual distortion is obtained in the

classes like bipartite, co-bipartite and split graphs below $O(n^{0.5 -

Till date, there is no well known graph class of unbounded boxicity for which
even an $n^\epsilon$-factor approximation algorithm for computing boxicity is
known, for any $\epsilon <1$. In this paper, we study the boxicity problem on
Circular Arc graphs - intersection graphs of arcs of a circle. We give a
$(2+\frac{1}{k})$-factor polynomial time approximation algorithm for computing
the boxicity of any circular arc graph along with a corresponding box
representation, where $k \ge 1$ is its boxicity. For Normal Circular Arc(NCA)
graphs, with an NCA model given, this can be improved to an additive 2-factor
approximation algorithm. The time complexity of the algorithms to approximately
compute the boxicity is $O(mn+n^2)$ in both these cases and in $O(mn+kn^2)=
O(n^3)$ time we also get their corresponding box representations, where $n$ is
the number of vertices of the graph and $m$ is its number of edges. The
additive 2-factor algorithm directly works for any Proper Circular Arc graph,
since computing an NCA model for it can be done in polynomial time.

far beyond quantum information processing. Early applications may be found in
entanglement enhanced sensing and metrology. Quantum spins in condensed matter
offer promising candidates for investigating and exploiting superposition and
entanglement, and enormous progress is being made in quantum control of such
systems. In GaAs, individual electron spins can be manipulated and measured,
and singlet-triplet states can be controlled in double-dot structures. In
silicon, individual electron spins can be detected by ionisation of phosphorous
donors, and information can be transferred from electron spins to nuclear spins
to provide long memory times. Electron and nuclear spins can be manipulated in
nitrogen atoms incarcerated in fullerene molecules, which in turn can be
assembled in ordered arrays. Spin states of charged nitrogen vacancy centres in
diamond can be manipulated and read optically. Collective spin states in a
range of materials systems offer scope for holographic storage of information.

  time-dependent billiards","12 Pages, 7 figures",,"10.1063/1.3697399",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The standard description of Fermi acceleration, developing in a class of
time-dependent billiards, is given in terms of a diffusion process taking place
in momentum space. Within this framework the evolution of the probability
density function (PDF) of the magnitude of particle velocities as a function of
the number of collisions $n$ is determined by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE).
In the literature the FPE is constructed by identifying the transport
coefficients with the ensemble averages of the change of the magnitude of
particle velocity and its square in the course of one collision. Although this
treatment leads to the correct solution after a sufficiently large number of
collisions has been reached, the transient part of the evolution of the PDF is
not described. Moreover, in the case of the Fermi-Ulam model (FUM), if a
stadanrd simplification is employed, the solution of the FPE is even
inconsistent with the values of the transport coefficients used for its
derivation. The goal of our work is to provide a self-consistent methodology
for the treatment of Fermi acceleration in time-dependent billiards. The
proposed approach obviates any assumptions for the continuity of the random
process and the existence of the limits formally defining the transport
coefficients of the FPE. Specifically, we suggest, instead of the calculation
of ensemble averages, the derivation of the one-step transition probability
function and the use of the Chapman-Kolmogorov forward equation. This approach
is generic and can be applied to any time-dependent billiard for the treatment
of Fermi-acceleration. As a first step, we apply this methodology to the FUM,
being the archetype of time-dependent billiards to exhibit Fermi acceleration.

the case. For multiple layers the critical strength for the density-wave
instability decreases with the number of layers. The effect depends on density
and is more pronounced in the low density regime. The lowest solution of the
instability corresponds to the density waves in the different layers being
in-phase, whereas higher solutions have one or several adjancet layers that are

can be beneficial but there is a significant cost associated with acquiring
instantaneous CSI. We perform a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity
for 2 types of CSI feedback methods, dedicated feedback and SNR dependent
feedback, quantifying how many users should feedback CSI from a net throughput
perspective. Dedicated feedback, in which orthogonal resources are allocated to
each user, has significant feedback cost and this limits the amount of
available multiuser diversity that can be used. SNR dependent feedback method,
in which only users with SNR above a threshold attempt to feedback, has
relatively much smaller feedback cost and this allows for all of the available
multiuser diversity to be used. Next, we study the effect of single user
multiantenna techniques, which reduce the SNR variation, on the number of
feedback users neccessary. It is seen that a broadcast channel using single
user multiantenna techniques should reduce the number of feedback users with
the spatial dimension.

this formulation by showing that one can treat a wide class of relativistic

the interaction of the planet with the coronal material of the host star,
focusing on physical causes that can lead to temporal variations in the shock
characteristics. We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock
around its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For
WASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.
Observational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal
variations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock
and the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's
magnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding
ambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the
known eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets. We show that, because the distance
from the star changes along the orbit of an eccentric planet, the shock
characteristics are modulated by orbital phase. We predict time offsets between
the beginnings of the near-UV and optical light curves that are, in general,
less than the transit duration. Variations in shock characteristics caused in
eccentric systems can only be probed if the shock is observed at different
orbital phases, which is, in general, not the case for transit observations.
However, non-thermal radio emission produced by the interaction of the star and
planet should be modulated by orbital phase. We also quantify the response of
the shock to variations in the coronal material itself due to, e.g., a
non-axisymmetric stellar corona, planetary obliquity, intrinsic variations of
the stellar magnetic field. Such variations do not depend on the system
eccentricity. We conclude that, for systems where a shock is detectable through
transit light curve observations, shock variations should be a common
occurrence. (Abridged)

detail by retaining essential properties of the underlying geographic space. In
this paper, we explore how the map generalization process can be guided by the
underlying scaling of geographic space. The scaling of geographic space refers
to the fact that in a geographic space small things are far more common than
large ones. In the corresponding rank-size distribution, this scaling property
is characterized by a heavy tailed distribution such as a power law, lognormal,
or exponential function. In essence, any heavy tailed distribution consists of
the head of the distribution (with a low percentage of vital or large things)
and the tail of the distribution (with a high percentage of trivial or small
things). Importantly, the low and high percentages constitute an imbalanced
contrast, e.g., 20 versus 80. We suggest that map generalization is to retain
the objects in the head and to eliminate or aggregate those in the tail. We
applied this selection rule or principle to three generalization experiments,
and found that the scaling of geographic space indeed underlies map
generalization. We further relate the universal rule to T\""opfer's radical law
(or trained cartographers' decision making in general), and illustrate several
advantages of the universal rule.

momentum the atoms going to other Zeeman components acquire an orbital angular
momentum and circulate around the center of the trap. This is a realization of
Einstein-de Haas effect in a system of cold gases. We show that the transfer of
atoms via dipolar interaction is possible only when the energies of the initial

resonant external magnetic field, which tunes energies of involved states via

properties of galaxies and is a reference for any comparison with high redshift
observations. The all sky (or very large) surveys performed from the
ultraviolet (UV) to the far-infrared (far-IR) gives us large datasets with a
very large wavelength coverage to perform a reference study. We want to
investigate dust attenuation characteristics as well as star formation rate
(SFR) calibrations on a sample of nearby galaxies observed over 13 bands from
0.15 to 160 microns. A sample of 363 galaxies is built from the AKARI /FIS all
sky survey cross-correlated with SDSS and GALEX surveys. Broad band spectral
energy distributions are fitted with the CIGALE code optimized to analyze
variations in dust attenuation curves and SFR measurements and based on an
energetic budget between the stellar and dust emission. Our galaxy sample is
primarily selected in far-IR and mostly constituted of massive, actively star
forming galaxies. There is some evidence for a dust attenuation law slightly
steeper than that used for starburst galaxies but we are unable to constrain
the presence or not of a bump at 220 nm. We confirm that a time dependent dust
attenuation is necessary to perform the best fits. Various calibrations of the
dust attenuation in the UV as a function of UV-optical colours are discussed. A
calibration of the current star formation rate combining UV and total IR
emissions is proposed with an accurate estimation of dust heating by old stars:
for the whole sample 17 % of the total dust luminosity is not related to the
recent star formation

assembly in the Universe. Our knowledge of their observational properties has
considerably improved over the past decade, and the long standing questions
concerning their origin and rarity are now starting to receive some answers. It
is nowadays fairly well established that massive cluster mergers are the key
ingredient to account for the origin of halos and relics. The increasing number
of halos and relics found now allow to derive significant statistical
correlations. It has been shown that galaxy clusters may be radio-loud or
radio--quiet with respect to the presence of radio halos. Morevoer, radio halos
and relics are present only in unrelaxed clusters, whereas no such sources have
ever been found in relaxed systems. It has also become clear that a large
distribution exists for the spectral index of the synchrotron spectrum of radio
halos, and ultra-steep halos have been found.
  Despite all this, a number of observational issues remain open. Well defined
radio spectra, from ~ hundred MHz to GHz frequencies and good spectral imaging
are available only for few halos and relics, and such information is crucial
for a detailed understanding of their origin. It is presently unclear if there
are basic differences between clusters with ultra steep spectrum radio halos
and those hosting ""classical"" ones, and it is unknown if less energetic mergers
result in an observational signature in the radio band. With the forthcoming
advent of LOFAR and of the SKA Pathfinders, we will soon be able to observe
galaxy clusters with a major improvement in the radio sensitivity and frequency
coverage, and we expect to be able to soon address some of these pressing
questions.

requires knowledge of any parameter that can affect their luminosity in either
systematic or statistical ways. Observational samples of SNIa commonly use the
metallicity of the host galaxy, Z_host, as an estimator of the supernova
progenitor metallicity, Z_Ia, that is one of the primary factors affecting SNIa
magnitude. Here, we present a theoretical study of the relationship between
Z_Ia and Z_host. We follow the chemical evolution of homogeneous galaxy models
together with the evolution of the supernova rates in order to evaluate the
metallicity distribution function, MDF(Delta Z), i.e. the probability that the
logarithm of the metallicity of a SNIa exploding now differs in less than Delta
Z from that of its host. We analyse several model galaxies aimed to represent
from active to passive galaxies, including dwarf galaxies prone to experience
supernova driven outflows. We analyse the sensitivity of the MDF to uncertain
ingredients: IMF, star-formation law, stellar lifetime, stellar yields, and
SNIa delay-time distribution. There is a remarkable degree of agreement between
the mean Z_Ia in a galaxy and its Z_host when they both are measured as the CNO
abundance, especially if the DTD peaks at small time delays, while the average
Fe abundance of host and SNIa may differ up to 0.4-0.6 dex in passive galaxies.
The dispersion of Z_Ia in active galaxy models is quite small, meaning that
Z_host is a quite good estimator of the supernova metallicity. Passive galaxies
present a larger dispersion, which is more pronounced in low mass galaxies. We
discuss the use of different metallicity indicators: Fe vs. O, and gas-phase
metallicity vs. stellar metallicity. The results of the application of our
formalism to a galactic catalogue (VESPA) are roughly consistent with our
theoretical estimates. (abridged)

we say that such systems have toric steady states. Our main result gives
sufficient conditions for a chemical reaction system to have toric steady
states. Furthermore, we analyze the capacity of such a system to exhibit

with their periodic arrangement in air introduces high technological
possibilities to control noise. Sound manipulation is perhaps the most obvious
application of the structures presented in this work. We apply this methodology
to develop a device as an alternative to the conventional acoustic barriers
with several properties from the acoustical point of view but also with
additional aesthetic and constructive characteristics.

to the phase diagram of hole doped cuprates. An order parameter associated with
the flux or $d$ charge-density wave ($d$-CDW) phase competes and coexists with
superconductivity at low doping showing characteristics identified with the
observed pseudogap in underdoped cuprates. In addition, in the $d$-CDW state
the Fermi surface is reconstructed toward pockets with low spectral weight in
the outer part, resembling the arcs observed in angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy experiments. However, the $d$-CDW requires broken translational
symmetry, a fact that is not completely accepted. Including self-energy
corrections beyond the mean, field we found that the self-energy can be written
as two distinct contributions. One of these (called $\Sigma_{flux}$) dominates
at low energy and originates from the scattering between carriers and $d$-CDW
fluctuations in proximity to the $d$-CDW instability. The second contribution
(called $\Sigma_{R\lambda}$) dominates at large energy and originates from the
scattering between charge fluctuations under the constraint of non double
occupancy. In this paper it is shown that $\Sigma_{flux}$ is responsible for
the origin of low-energy features in the spectral function as a pseudogap and
Fermi arcs. The obtained doping and temperature dependence of the pseudogap and
Fermi arcs is similar to that observed in experiments. At low energy,
$\Sigma_{R \lambda}$ gives an additional contribution to the closure of the
pseudogap.

considers the size of the level sets of T both from a probabilistic point of
view and from the perspective of Baire category. We first give more elementary
proofs of three recently published results. The first, due to Z. Buczolich,
states that almost all level sets (with respect to Lebesgue measure on the
range of T) are finite. The second, due to J. Lagarias and Z. Maddock, states
that the average number of points in a level set is infinite. The third result,
also due to Lagarias and Maddock, states that the average number of local level
sets contained in a level set is 3/2. In the second part of the paper it is
shown that, in contrast to the above results, the set of ordinates y with
uncountably infinite level sets is residual, and a fairly explicit description
of this set is given. The paper also gives a negative answer to a question of
Lagarias and Maddock by showing that most level sets (in the sense of Baire
category) contain infinitely many local level sets, and that a continuum of
level sets even contain uncountably many local level sets. Finally, several of
the main results are extended to a version of T with arbitrary signs in the
summands.

recent years we studied at many wavelengths a sample of these objects selected
from the B3-VLA catalog: the B3-VLA CSS sample. Only ~ 60 % of the sources were

cross-correlated the CSS B3-VLA sample with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

and photometric redshifts for eight faint galaxies and for one quasar and two
quasar candidates. Overall we have 27 galaxies with SDSS photometry in five
bands, for which we derived the ultraviolet-optical spectral energy
distribution (UV-O-SED). We extended our investigation to additional CSS/GPS
selected from the literature. Most of the galaxies show an excess of
ultra-violet (UV) radiation compared with the UV-O-SED of local radio-quiet
ellipticals. We found a strong dependence of the UV excess on redshift and
analyzed it assuming that it is generated either from the nucleus (hidden
quasar) or from a young stellar population (YSP). We also compare the UV-O-SEDs
of our CSS/GPS sources with those of a selection of large size (LSO) powerful
radio sources from the literature. If the major process of the UV excess is
caused by a YSP, our conclusion is that it is the result of the merger process
that also triggered the onset of the radio source with some time delay. We do
not see evidence for a major contribution from a YSP triggered by the radio
sources itself.

accumulate close to critical points, where the susceptibility diverges in
infinite systems. On the other, this region is the one where the estimate of

discuss inference of interacting point processes with application to financial

illustrates the occurrence of the characteristic shift and the significance of

occurrence does not depend on the properties of the detection system. We give

(a = 0.0171 AU = 4.48 R_st), with its spin and orbital rotation likely
synchronized. The comparison of its location in the (Mpl, Rpl) plane with the
predictions of planetary models for different compositions points to an
Earth-like composition, even if the error bars of the measured quantities and
the partial degeneracy of the models prevent a definitive conclusion. The
proximity to its star provides an additional constraint on the model. It
implies a high extreme-UV flux and particle wind, and the corresponding
efficient erosion of the planetary atmosphere especially for volatile species
including water. Consequently, we make the working hypothesis that the planet
is rocky with no volatiles in its atmosphere, and derive the physical
properties that result. As a consequence, the atmosphere is made of rocky
vapours with a very low pressure (P \leq 1.5 Pa), no cloud can be sustained,
and no thermalisation of the planetary is expected. The dayside is very hot
(2474 \leq 71 K at the sub-stellar point) while the nightside is very cold (50
to 75 K). The sub-stellar point is as hot as the tungsten filament of an
incandescent bulb, resulting in the melting and distillation of silicate rocks
and the formation of a lava ocean. These possible features of CoRoT-7b could be
common to many small and hot planets, including the recently discovered

Order, to appear",,,,"math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A lattice L is spatial if every element of L is a join of completely
join-irreducible elements of L (points), and strongly spatial if it is spatial
and the minimal coverings of completely join-irreducible elements are
well-behaved. Herrmann, Pickering, and Roddy proved in 1994 that every modular
lattice can be embedded, within its variety, into an algebraic and spatial
lattice. We extend this result to n-distributive lattices, for fixed n. We
deduce that the variety of all n-distributive lattices is generated by its
finite members, thus it has a decidable word problem. This solves two problems
stated by Huhn in 1985. We prove that every modular (resp., n-distributive)
lattice embeds within its variety into some strongly spatial lattice. Every
lattice which is either algebraic modular spatial or bi-algebraic is strongly
spatial. We also construct a lattice that cannot be embedded, within its
variety, into any algebraic and spatial lattice. This lattice has a least and a
largest element, and it generates a locally finite, join-semidistributive
variety.

of the form [0, a], a is real. Several types of interval semigroups like fuzzy
interval semigroups, interval symmetric semigroups, special symmetric interval
semigroups, interval matrix semigroups and interval polynomial semigroups are
defined and discussed. This book has eight chapters. The main feature of this
book is that we suggest 241 problems in the eighth chapter. In this book the
authors have defined 29 new concepts and illustrates them with 231 examples.
Certainly this will find several applications.
