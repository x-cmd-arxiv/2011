control on the face degrees and on the girth. Recall that the girth is the
length of the smallest cycle, so that maps of girth at least $d=1,2,3$ are
respectively the general, loopless, and simple maps. For each positive integer
$d$, we obtain a bijection for the class of plane maps (maps with one
distinguished root-face) of girth $d$ having a root-face of degree $d$. We then
obtain more general bijective constructions for annular maps (maps with two
distinguished root-faces) of girth at least $d$. Our bijections associate to
each map a decorated plane tree, and non-root faces of degree $k$ of the map
correspond to vertices of degree $k$ of the tree. As special cases we recover
several known bijections for bipartite maps, loopless triangulations, simple
triangulations, simple quadrangulations, etc. Our work unifies and greatly
extends these bijective constructions. In terms of counting, we obtain for each
integer $d$ an expression for the generating function
$F_d(x_d,x_{d+1},x_{d+2},...)$ of plane maps of girth $d$ with root-face of
degree $d$, where the variable $x_k$ counts the non-root faces of degree $k$.
The expression for $F_1$ was already obtained bijectively by Bouttier, Di
Francesco and Guitter, but for $d\geq 2$ the expression of $F_d$ is new. We
also obtain an expression for the generating function
$\G_{p,q}^{(d,e)}(x_d,x_{d+1},...)$ of annular maps with root-faces of degrees
$p$ and $q$, such that cycles separating the two root-faces have length at
least $e$ while other cycles have length at least $d$. Our strategy is to
obtain all the bijections as specializations of a single ""master bijection""
introduced by the authors in a previous article. In order to use this approach,
we exhibit certain ""canonical orientations"" characterizing maps with prescribed

lattice QCD results in thermodynamic equilibrium. According to the DQPM the
constituents of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) are massive
and off-shell quasi-particles (quarks and gluons) with broad spectral
functions. In order to address the electromagnetic radiation of the sQGP, we
derive off-shell cross sections of q+qbar->gamma*, q+qbar->gamma*+g and
q+g->gamma*+q (qbar+g->gamma*+qbar) reactions taking into account the effective
propagators for quarks and gluons from the DQPM. Dilepton production in In+In

implementing these off-shell processes into the PHSD transport approach. By

light scattered from surface components is modeled using a radiative transfer

major elements of the planet (in the case of the Earth, clouds and ocean) with
observations having S/N $\gtrsim 10$ in most cases and with high confidence if
S/N $\gtrsim 20$. In addition, S/N $\gtrsim 100$ enables us to detect the
presence of components other than ocean and clouds in a fairly
model-independent way. Degradation of our inversion procedure produced by cloud
cover is also quantified. While cloud cover significantly dilutes the magnitude
of color variations compared to the cloudless case, the pattern of color
changes remains. Therefore, the possibility of investigating surface features

For any complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, let
$u_\zeta=u_\zeta({\mathfrak g})$ be the associated ""small"" quantum enveloping
algebra. In general, little is known about the representation theory of quantum
groups (resp., algebraic groups) when $l$ (resp., $p$) is smaller than the
Coxeter number $h$ of the underlying root system. For example, Lusztig's
conjecture concerning the characters of the rational irreducible $G$-modules
stipulates that $p \geq h$. The main result in this paper provides a
surprisingly uniform answer for the cohomology algebra
$\opH^\bullet(u_\zeta,{\mathbb C})$ of the small quantum group. When $\ell>h$,
this cohomology algebra has been calculated by Ginzburg and Kumar \cite{GK}.
Our result requires powerful tools from complex geometry and a detailed
knowledge of the geometry of the nullcone of $\mathfrak g$. In this way, the
methods point out difficulties present in obtaining similar results for the
restricted enveloping algebra $u$ in small characteristics, though they do
provide some clarification of known results there also. Finally, we establish
that if $M$ is a finite dimensional $u_\zeta$-module, then
$\opH^\bullet(u_\zeta,M)$ is a finitely generated $\opH^\bullet(u_\zeta,\mathbb
C)$-module, and we obtain new results on the theory of support varieties for

focused on cases in which the wiretap channel could be modeled as statistically
independent packet erasure channels for the legitimate receiver and an
eavesdropper. In this paper, we go beyond the state-of-the-art by addressing
correlated erasure events across the two communication channels. The resulting
security enhancement is presented as a function of the correlation coefficient
and the erasure probabilities for both channels. It is shown that security
improvements are achievable by means of judicious physical-layer design even
when the eavesdropper has a better channel than the legitimate receiver. The
only case in which this assertion may not hold is when erasures are highly
correlated across channels. However, we are able to prove that correlation
cannot nullify the expected security enhancement if the channel quality of the

Additional improvements including random wall source techniques and a judicious
choice of momenta carried by the incoming and outgoing quarks are employed for
error reduction. Analyzing the form factor data for the pion mass at $M_\pi

with the experimental value of $0.452\pm 0.011 {\rm fm}^2$. Below $M_\pi\approx
300$ MeV, we find that statistical fluctuations in the pion two- and

the energy source for many of the Lyman-band H$_{2}$ fluorescent lines commonly

in the H$_{2}$ pumping transitions from a portion of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line
significantly differ from the amount of energy in the resulting fluorescent

along our light of sight, we can correct the H$_{2}$ absorption/emission ratios
so that they are close to unity. The required H I absorption for DF Tau is at a
velocity close to the radial velocity of the star, consistent with H I
absorption in the edge-on disk and interstellar medium. For V4046 Sgr, a nearly
face-on system, the required absorption is between +100 km/s and +290 km/s,
most likely resulting from H I gas in the accretion columns falling onto the

spatial and spectral distributions of energetic electrons for a flare (GOES
M3.7 class, April 14, 2002 23$:$55 UT), which was previously found to be

high density plasma in the loop, electrons have to be continuously accelerated
about the loop apex of length $\sim 2\times 10^9$cm and width $\sim 7\times

occur both along and across the guiding magnetic field of the loop. We show
that the cross-field transport is consistent with the presence of magnetic
turbulence in the loop, where electrons are accelerated, and estimate the
magnitude of the field line diffusion coefficient for different phases of the
flare. The energy density of magnetic fluctuations is calculated for given
magnetic field correlation lengths and is larger than the energy density of the
non-thermal electrons. The level of magnetic fluctuations peaks when the
largest number of electrons is accelerated and is below detectability or absent

their dominant accretion mechanism. We show how SFXTs span across the divided

SFXTs represent an evolutionary link. The use of HMXBs as tracers of recent
massive star formation is revisited as we present the first ever spatial

indicate that at distances less than a few kpc from a given HMXB, it is more

the performance of these techniques compares favorably to other explicit

longitudinal applied magnetic field. The theory is an extension of the elliptic
critical-state model introduced by Romero-Salazar and Perez-Rodriguez. The
vortex dynamics depend in detail upon two nonlinear effective resistivities for
flux cutting (\rho_\parallel) and flux flow (\rho_\perp), and their ratio r =
\rho_\parallel/\rho_\perp. When r < 1, the low relative efficiency of flux
cutting in reducing the magnitude of the internal magnetic-flux density leads
to a paramagnetic longitudinal magnetic moment. As a model for understanding
the experimentally observed interrelationship between the critical currents for
flux cutting and depinning, I calculate the forces on a helical vortex arc
stretched between two pinning centers when the vortex is subjected to a current
density of arbitrary angle \phi. Simultaneous initiation of flux cutting and
flux transport occurs at the critical current density J_c(\phi) that makes the
vortex arc unstable.

may need no UV completion. By analogy with gravity where classical black holes
are expected to be created in high-energy scatterings, it is conjectured that
similar classical solutions, so-called classicalons, should occur. In this way
the theory protects itself against non-unitarity, for instead of probing small
distances at high energies one enters a classical regime. An effective theory
of Goldstone bosons provides and example in which the size of classicalons
grows with energy, and the high energy scattering is cut-off by small momenta,
inversely proportional to the classicalon size. In this note we offer an
alternative, path integral discussion of this important result.

  Stable Parallel Looped Dynamics","37 pages, 9 figures - revised for clarity",,,,"cs.AI q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of consciousness faced several challenges for a few reasons: (a)
a lack of necessary and sufficient conditions, without which we would not know
how close we are to the solution, (b) a lack of a synthesis framework to build
conscious systems and (c) a lack of mechanisms explaining the transition
between the lower-level chemical dynamics and the higher-level abstractions. In
this paper, I address these issues using a new framework. The central result is
that a person is 'minimally' conscious if and only if he knows at least one
truth. This lets us move away from the vagueness surrounding consciousness and
instead focus equivalently on: (i) what truths are and how our brain
represents/relates them to each other and (ii) how we attain a feeling of
knowing for a truth. For the former problem, since truths are things that do
not change, I replace the abstract notion with a dynamical one called fixed
sets. These sets are guaranteed to exist for our brain and other stable
parallel looped systems. The relationships between everyday events are now
built using relationships between fixed sets, until our brain creates a unique
dynamical state called the self-sustaining threshold 'membrane' of fixed sets.
For the latter problem, I present necessary and sufficient conditions for
attaining a feeling of knowing using a definition of continuity applied to
abstractions. Combining these results, I now say that a person is minimally
conscious if and only if his brain has a self-sustaining dynamical membrane
with abstract continuous paths. A synthetic system built to satisfy this
equivalent self-sustaining membrane condition appears indistinguishable from
human consciousness.

generated automatically from moderate-resolution optical spectra calculated as
a function of merger progress in each of a large suite of simulations. The
mass, gas fraction, orbital parameters, and mass ratio of the merging galaxies
are varied systematically, showing that the lifetime and properties of the K+A
phase are strong functions of merger scenario. K+A durations are generally less
than ~0.1-0.3 Gyr, significantly shorter than the commonly assumed 1 Gyr, which
is obtained only in rare cases, owing to a wide variation in star formation
histories resulting from different orbital and progenitor configurations.
Combined with empirical merger rates, the model lifetimes predict
rapidly-rising K+A fractions as a function of redshift that are consistent with
results of large spectroscopic surveys, resolving tension between the observed
K+A abundance and that predicted when one assumes the K+A duration is the
lifetime of A stars (~1 Gyr). The effects of dust attenuation, viewing angle,
and aperture bias on our models are analyzed. In some cases, the K+A features
are longer-lived and more pronounced when AGN feedback removes dust from the
center, uncovering the young stars formed during the burst. In this picture,
the K+A phase begins during or shortly after the bright starburst/AGN phase in
violent mergers, and thus offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of
quasar and star formation feedback on the gas reservoir and evolution of the
remnant. Analytic fitting formulae are provided for the estimates of K+A

The long-term evolution of these two states is different. In the dead state the
star spins down incompletely, retaining much of its initial spin. In the
trapped state the star asymptotically can spin down to arbitarily low rates,
its angular momentum transferred to the disc. We identify these outcomes with
respectively the rapidly rotating and the very slowly rotating classes of Ap
stars and magnetic white dwarfs.

contradictory observations: The slow wind has the composition of the closed
field corona, implying that it originates from the continuous opening and
closing of flux at the boundary between open and closed field. On the other
hand, the slow wind also has large angular width, up to ~ 60{\circ}, suggesting
that its source extends far from the open-closed boundary. We propose a model
that can explain both observations. The key idea is that the source of the slow
wind at the Sun is a network of narrow (possibly singular) open-field corridors
that map to a web of separatrices and quasi-separatrix layers in the
heliosphere. We compute analytically the topology of an open-field corridor and
show that it produces a quasi-separatrix layer in the heliosphere that extends
to angles far from the heliospheric current sheet. We then use an MHD code and
MDI/SOHO observations of the photospheric magnetic field to calculate
numerically, with high spatial resolution, the quasi-steady solar wind and
magnetic field for a time period preceding the August 1, 2008 total solar
eclipse. Our numerical results imply that, at least for this time period, a web
of separatrices (which we term an S-web) forms with sufficient density and
extent in the heliosphere to account for the observed properties of the slow
wind. We discuss the implications of our S-web model for the structure and
dynamics of the corona and heliosphere, and propose further tests of the model.

  ""Part and Whole"" in Leiden during the period March 22-26, 2010",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The renormalization method is specifically aimed at connecting theories
describing physical processes at different length scales and thereby connecting
different theories in the physical sciences.
  The renormalization method used today is the outgrowth of one hundred and
fifty years of scientific study of thermal physics and phase transitions.
Different phases of matter show qualitatively different behavior separated by
abrupt phase transitions. These qualitative differences seem to be present in
experimentally observed condensed-matter systems. However, the ""extended
singularity theorem"" in statistical mechanics shows that sharp changes can only
occur in infinitely large systems. Abrupt changes from one phase to another are
signaled by fluctuations that show correlation over infinitely long distances,
and are measured by correlation functions that show algebraic decay as well as
various kinds of singularities and infinities in thermodynamic derivatives and
in measured system parameters.
  Renormalization methods were first developed in field theory to get around
difficulties caused by apparent divergences at both small and large scales.
  The renormalization (semi-)group theory of phase transitions was put together
by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1971 based upon ideas of scaling and universality
developed earlier in the context of phase transitions and of couplings
dependent upon spatial scale coming from field theory. Correlations among
regions with fluctuations in their order underlie renormalization ideas.
Wilson's theory is the first approach to phase transitions to agree with the
extended singularity theorem.
  Some of the history of the study of these correlations and singularities is
recounted, along with the history of renormalization and related concepts of
scaling and universality. Applications are summarized.

bitterly for over thirty years. The Wright-Fisher controversy forms a
cornerstone of the history and philosophy of biology. I argue that the standard

the ideas and arguments of these two key historical figures. The usual account
contrasts the major slogans attached to each name: Wright's adaptive landscape
and shifting balance theory of evolution versus Fisher's fundamental theorem of
natural selection. These alternative theories are in fact incommensurable.
Wright's theory is a detailed dynamical model of evolutionary change in actual
populations. Fisher's theory is an abstract invariance and conservation law
that, like all physical laws, captures essential features of a system but does
not account for all aspects of dynamics in real examples. This key contrast
between embodied theories of real cases and abstract laws is missing from prior
analyses of Wright versus Fisher. They never argued about this contrast.
Instead, the issue at stake in their arguments concerned the actual dynamics of
real populations. Both agreed that fluctuations of nonadditive (epistatic) gene
combinations play a central role in evolution. Wright emphasized stochastic
fluctuations of gene combinations in small, isolated populations. By contrast,
Fisher believed that fluctuating selection in large populations was the main
cause of fluctuation in nonadditive gene combinations. Close reading shows that
widely cited views attributed to Fisher mostly come from what Wright said about
Fisher, whereas Fisher's own writings clearly do not support such views.

spectral functions are examined over a wide range of parameter space through
techniques often used in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).
Analyzing over 1200 simulations we consider variations of the microscopic
coupling strength, phonon energy and dimensionality for two models: a
momentum-independent Holstein model, and momentum-dependent coupling to a
breathing mode phonon. In this limit we find that any `effective coupling',
lambda_eff, inferred from the quasiparticle renormalizations differs from the
microscopic dimensionless coupling characterizing these Hamiltonians, lambda,
and could drastically either over- or under-estimate it depending on the
particular parameters and model. In contrast, we show that perturbation theory
retains good predictive power for low coupling and small momenta, and that the
momentum-dependence of the self-energy can be revealed via the relationship
between velocity renormalization and quasiparticle strength. Additionally we
find that (although not strictly valid) it is often possible to infer the
self-energy and bare electronic structure through a self-consistent
Kramers-Kronig bare-band fitting; and also that through lineshape alone, when
Lorentzian, it is possible to reliably extract the shape of the imaginary part

of turbulent viscosity required for the associated angular momentum transport
for fast accretion in Keplerian disks. Previously cited laboratory experiments
in supporting this hypothesis were performed either in a different type of flow
than Keplerian or without quantitative measurements of angular momentum
transport and mean flow profile, and all of them appear to suffer from Ekman
effects, secondary flows induced by nonoptimal axial boundary conditions. Such
Ekman effects are expected to be absent from astronomical disks, which probably
have stress-free vertical boundaries unless strongly magnetized. Aims: To
quantify angular momentum transport due to subcritical hydrodynamic turbulence,
if exists, in a quasi-Keplerian flow with minimized Ekman effects. Methods: We
perform a local measurement of the azimuthal--radial component of the Reynolds
stress tensor in a novel laboratory apparatus where Ekman effects are minimized
by flexible control of axial boundary conditions. Results: We find significant
Ekman effects on angular momentum transport due to nonoptimal axial boundary
conditions in quasi-Keplerian flows. With the optimal control of Ekman effects,
no statistically meaningful angular momentum transport is detected in such
flows at Reynolds number up to two millions. Conclusions: Either a subcritical
transition does not occur, or, if a subcritical transition does occur, the
associated radial transport of angular momentum in optimized quasi-Keplerian
laboratory flows is too small to directly support the hypothesis that
subcritical hydrodynamic turbulence is responsible for accretion in
astrophysical disks. Possible limitations in applying laboratory results to
astrophysical disks due to experimental geometry are discussed.

down-quarks to Higgs scalars such that the quark mass matrices M_u, M_d have
Nearest-Neighbour-Interaction (NNI) structure, once they are generated through
the electroweak symmetry breaking. It turns out in this framework that Z_4 is
indeed the minimal discrete symmetry and its implementation requires the
introduction of at least two Higgs quintets, which leads to a two Higgs doublet
model at low energy scale. Due to the SU(5) unification, it is shown that the
charged lepton mass matrix develops also NNI form. However, the effective
neutrino mass matrix exhibits a non parallel pattern, in the framework of the
type-I seesaw mechanism. Analysing all possible zero textures allowed by
gauge-horizontal symmetry SU(5) x Z_4, it is seen that only two patterns are in
agreement with the leptonic experimental data and they could be further
distinguished by the light neutrino mass spectrum hierarchy. It is also
demonstrated that Z_4 freezes out the possibility of proton decay through

important goal of molecular systems biology. Some insights have been gained
into features of their network topology through the discovery of graph
theoretic patterns that constrain network dynamics. This paper contributes to
the identification of patterns in the mechanisms that govern network dynamics.
The control of nodes in gene regulatory, signaling, and metabolic networks is
governed by a variety of biochemical mechanisms, with inputs from other network
nodes that act additively or synergistically. This paper focuses on a certain
type of logical rule that appears frequently as a regulatory pattern. Within
the context of the multistate discrete model paradigm, a rule type is
introduced that reduces to the concept of nested canalyzing function in the
Boolean network case. It is shown that networks that employ this type of
multivalued logic exhibit more robust dynamics than random networks, with few
attractors and short limit cycles. It is also shown that the majority of
regulatory functions in many published models of gene regulatory and signaling
networks are nested canalyzing.

studying the dynamic universe. With the next generation of radio
interferometers being planned and built, there is great potential for detecting
and studying large samples of radio transients. Currently-used image-based
techniques for detecting radio sources have not been demonstrated to be
optimal, and there is a need for development of more sophisticated algorithms,
and methodology for comparing different detection techniques. A
visibility-space detector benefits from our good understanding of
visibility-space noise properties, and does not suffer from the image artifacts
and need for deconvolution in image-space detectors. In this paper, we propose
a method for designing optimal source detectors using visibility data, building
on statistical decision theory. The approach is substantially different to
conventional radio astronomy source detection. Optimal detection requires an
accurate model for the data, and we present a realistic model for the
likelihood function of radio interferometric data, including the effects of
calibration, signal confusion and atmospheric phase fluctuations. As part of
this process, we derive fundamental limits on the calibration of an
interferometric array, including the case where many relatively weak ""in-beam""
calibrators are used. These limits are then applied, along with a model for
atmospheric phase fluctuations, to determine the limits on measuring source
position, flux density and spectral index, in the general case. We then present
an optimal visibility-space detector using realistic models for an
interferometer.

set of jobs whose sizes and rewards are drawn from a known probability
distribution. However, we know the actual size and reward only when the job
completes. How should we schedule jobs to maximize the expected total reward?
We know O(1)-approximations when we assume that (i) rewards and sizes are
independent random variables, and (ii) we cannot prematurely cancel jobs. What
can we say when either or both of these assumptions are changed?
  The stochastic knapsack problem is of interest in its own right, but
techniques developed for it are applicable to other stochastic packing
problems. Indeed, ideas for this problem have been useful for budgeted learning
problems, where one is given several arms which evolve in a specified
stochastic fashion with each pull, and the goal is to pull the arms a total of
B times to maximize the reward obtained. Much recent work on this problem focus
on the case when the evolution of the arms follows a martingale, i.e., when the
expected reward from the future is the same as the reward at the current state.
What can we say when the rewards do not form a martingale?
  In this paper, we give constant-factor approximation algorithms for the
stochastic knapsack problem with correlations and/or cancellations, and also
for budgeted learning problems where the martingale condition is not satisfied.
Indeed, we can show that previously proposed LP relaxations have large
integrality gaps. We propose new time-indexed LP relaxations, and convert the
fractional solutions into distributions over strategies, and then use the LP
values and the time ordering information from these strategies to devise a
randomized adaptive scheduling algorithm. We hope our LP formulation and
decomposition methods may provide a new way to address other correlated bandit
problems with more general contexts.

eruptions in the post-nova state. We report on observed properties of the
long-term light curve of V446 Her, using photometry over 19 years. Yearly
averages of the outburst magnitudes shows a decline of ~0.013 mag/yr,
consistent with the decline of other post-novae that do not have dwarf nova
outbursts. Previous suggestions of bimodal distributions of the amplitudes and
widths of the outbursts are confirmed. The outbursts occur at a mean spacing of
18 days but the range of spacings is large (13-30 days). From simulations of
dwarf nova outbursts it has been predicted that the outburst spacing in V446
Her will increase as M-dot from the red dwarf companion slowly falls following
the nova; however the large intrinsic scatter in the spacings serves to hide
any evidence of this effect. We do find a systematic change in the outburst
pattern in which the brighter, wider type of outbursts disappeared after late
2003, and this phenomenon is suggested to be due to falling M-dot following the
nova.

spins in solids can form chiral configurations. In perovskite manganites RMnO3
(R=Tb, Dy,...etc), the Mn-spins form a cycloidal structure, which induces
ferroelectric polarization (P) through the relativistic spin-orbit interaction.
This magnetism-induced ferroelectricity (multiferroics) and associated
infrared-active spin waves (electromagnons) open a promising route to control
the spins by purely electric means in a very short time. In this paper, we show
theoretically with an accurate spin Hamiltonian for TbMnO3 that a picosecond

a less evolved companion, either a red giant or a main-sequence star. They have
dramatic optical brightenings of around 5-6 mag in V in less than a day,
several times a century. These occur at variable and unpredictable intervals,
and are followed by an optical decline over several weeks, and activity from
the X-ray to the radio. The unpredictability of recurrent novae and related
stellar types can hamper systematic study of their outbursts. Here we analyse
the long-term lightcurve of RS Ophiuchi, a recurrent nova with six confirmed
outbursts, most recently in 2006 February. We confirm the previously suspected
1945 outburst, largely obscured in a seasonal gap. We also find a signal via
wavelet analysis that can be used to predict an incipient outburst up to a few
hundred days before hand. This has never before been possible. In addition this
may suggest that the preferred thermonuclear runaway mechanism for the
outbursts will have to be modified, as no pre-outburst signal is anticipated in
that case. If our result indeed points to gaps in our understanding of how
outbursts are driven, we will need to study such objects carefully to determine
if the white dwarf is growing in mass, an essential factor if these systems are
to become Type Ia Supernovae. Determining the likelihood of recurrent novae
being an important source population will have implications for stellar and

approximately 2 years of LIGO data taken between November 2005 and September
2007 for systems with component masses of 1-99 solar masses and total masses of
25-100 solar masses. We did not detect any plausible gravitational-wave signals

determine the properties of Fabry-Perot resonators. Thermal (Brownian) noise in
these coatings produce excess phase noise which can seriously degrade the
sensitivity of high-precision measurements with these cavities, in particular
in laser gravitational-wave antennas (for example project LIGO), where at the
current stage it is one of the main limiting factors. We present a method to
calculate this effect accurately and analyze different strategies to diminish
it by optimizing the coating. Traditionally this noise is calculated as if the
beam is reflected from the surface of the mirror fluctuating due to the sums of
the fluctuations of each layer. However the beam in fact penetrates a coating
and Brownian expansion of the layers leads to dephasing of interference in the
coating and consequently to additional change in reflected phase. Fluctuations
in the thickness of a layer change the strain in the medium and hence due to
photoelastic effect change the refractive index of this layer. This additional
effect should be also considered. It is possible to make the noise smaller
preserving the reflectivity by changing the total number of layers and
thicknesses of high and low refractive ones. We show how this optimized coating
may be constructed analytically rather then numerically as before. We also
check the possibility to use internal resonant layers and optimized cap layer
to decrease the thermal noise.

lifetime of such a system is limited only by the spontaneous decay of the
Rydberg state, and is not significantly affected by photoionization or

adatom and C restatom structure, efficiently passivates the SiC(0001) surface
thanks to an adatom/restatom charge transfer mechanism. Here, we study the
effects of interface modifications on the graphene layer using density
functional theory calculations. The modifications we consider are inspired from
native interface defects observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. One H atom
per 4 {\times} 4 SiC cell (5 {\times} 5 graphene cell) is introduced in order
to saturate a restatom dangling bond and hinder the adatom/restatom charge
transfer. As a consequence, the graphene layer is doped with electrons from the
substrate and the interaction with the adatom states slightly increases. Native
interface defects are therefore likely to play an important role in the doping
mechanism on the C terminated SiC substrates. We also conclude that an
efficient passivation of the C face of SiC by H requires a complete removal of
the reconstruction. Otherwise, at variance with the Si terminated SiC
substrates, the presence of H at the interface would increase the
graphene/substrate interaction.

uncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,
suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are not
consistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. We identify
morphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),
blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). We use kinemetry
to analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types of
regular and non-regular rotators. We find 82% of regular rotators and 17%
non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due to
data quality. The non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions and
are massive. The majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetric
features, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinct
cores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).
Most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and are
non-regular rotators. While the trends are weak, there is a tendency that large
values of Psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities and
among the most massive galaxies in the sample. We suggest that the most common
formation mechanism for ETGs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.
Less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with much
lower net angular momentum.

  An analytical sensor model is developed, which includes axial heat conduction
in the fluid and a simple representation of the solid wall, assuming a
quasi-steady sensor response to the pulsatile flow. To reduce the mathematical
problem, described by a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation, a

experiments with the sensor mounted in a tube have been performed in steady and

transfer was treated in the framework of the theory of time-dependent turbulent

exhaustion in the stellar core the star is shown to be unstable against radial
oscillations while its effective temperature is Teff > 6700K for
Mzams=65M_\odot and Teff > 7200K for mzams=90M_\odot. Pulsational instability
is due to the \kappa-mechanism in helium ionization zones and at lower
effective temperature oscillations decay because of significantly increasing
convection. The upper limit of the period of radial pulsations on this stage of
evolution does not exceed 200 day. Radial oscillations of the hypergiant resume
during evolutionary contraction of outer layers when the effective temperature
is Teff > 7300K for Mzams=65M_\odot and Teff > 7600K for Mzams=90M_\odot.
Initially radial oscillations are due to instability of the first overtone and
transition to fundamental mode pulsations takes place at higher effective
temperatures (Teff > 7700K for Mzams=65M_\odot and Teff > 8200K for
Mzams=90M_\odot). The upper limit of the period of radial oscillations of

inhomogeneous media. We specify the equations of motion for a screw dislocation
in a functionally graded material. The material properties are assumed to vary
exponentially along the x and y-directions. In the present work we give the
analytical gauge field theoretic solution to the problem of a screw dislocation
in inhomogeneous media. Using the dislocation gauge approach, rigorous
analytical expressions for the elastic distortions, the force stresses, the
dislocation density and the pseudomoment stresses are obtained depending on the
moduli of gradation and an effective intrinsic length scale characteristic for
the functionally graded material under consideration.

periodic scalar potential, owing to the linear dispersion and the chiral
(pseudospin) nature of the electronic states, the group velocity of its
carriers is renormalized highly anisotropically in such a manner that the
velocity is invariant along the periodic direction but is reduced the most
along the perpendicular direction. Under a periodic scalar potential, new
massless Dirac fermions are generated at the supercell Brillouin zone
boundaries. Also, we show that if the strength of the applied scalar potential
is sufficiently strong, new zero-energy modes may be generated. With the
periodic scalar potential satisfying some special conditions, the energy
dispersion near the Dirac point becomes quasi one-dimensional. On the other
hand, for graphene under a one-dimensional periodic vector potential (resulting
in a periodic magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene plane), the group
velocity is reduced isotropically and monotonically with the strength of the

magnetic field, gravity, and stratification are directed along one axis. The
nonzero background electron thermal flux is taken into account. Collisions
between electrons and ions are included in the momentum equations. No
simplifications usual for the one-fluid MHD-approach in studying these

that the thermal flux perturbation generally stabilizes an instability for the
geometry under consideration. This result contradicts to conclusion obtained in
the MHD-approach. We show that the reason of this contradiction is the
simplified assumptions used in the MHD analysis of buoyancy instabilities and
the role of the longitudinal electric field perturbation which is not captured
by the ideal MHD equations. Our dispersion relation also shows that the medium
with the electron thermal flux can be unstable, if the temperature gradients of
ions and electrons have the opposite signs. The results obtained can be applied
to the weakly collisional magnetized plasma objects in laboratory and
astrophysics.

the opposite direction of the explosion site, consistent with the blocking of
the SN ejecta by the envelope. This scenario supports the single degenerate
binary origin of Tycho's SN. The properties of the X-ray arc, together with the
previous detection of the companion candidate and its space velocity by
Ruiz-Lapuente et al. (2004) and Hern\'{a}ndez et al.(2009), enables us to
further infer 1) the progenitor binary has a period of 4.9$^{+5.3}_{-3.0}$

the stripped envelope mass is about 0.0016($\leq0.0083$) $M_{\sun}$. However,

the above parameters need to be revised according to the actual properties of

problem is cast as an integer linear program.

again cast as an integer linear program. Here, we are considering pairs of
boundary elements to reflect curvature. Moreover, a constraint set is derived
to ensure that the boundary variables indeed reflect the boundary of the
regions described by the region variables.
  We show that by solving the linear programming relaxation one gets quite

increase the DoF of the 2 user interference channel. The use of instantaneous
relays (relays-without-delay) has been explored for the single user

forwarding at the relay, can achieve a higher capacity than conventional
relays. In this work, we show that the 2 user interference channel with an
instantaneous relay, achieves 3/2 DoF. Thus, an instantaneous relay increases
not only the capacity but also the DoF of the 2 user interference channel. The

is achieved with memoryless relays, i.e., with relays that have no memory of

Cepheus OB3b, NGC 2264, NGC 2362 and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We
discover a correlation between rotation rate and position in a colour-magnitude
diagram (CMD) such that stars which lie above an empirically determined median
pre-main sequence rotate more rapidly than stars which lie below this sequence.
The same correlation is seen, with a high degree of statistical significance,
in each association studied here. If position within the CMD is interpreted as
being due to genuine age spreads within a cluster, then the stars above the
median pre-main sequence would be the youngest stars. This would in turn imply
that the most rapidly rotating stars in an association are the youngest, and
hence those with the largest moments of inertia and highest likelihood of
ongoing accretion. Such a result does not fit naturally into the existing
picture of angular momentum evolution in young stars, where the stars are
braked effectively by their accretion discs until the disc disperses.
  Instead, we argue that, for a given association of young stars, position
within the CMD is not primarily a function of age, but of accretion history. We

Drawbacks of CDI are associated with the difficulty of the numerical phase

Common phase retrieval methods are based on iterative procedures which
propagate the complex-valued wave between object and detector plane.
Constraints in both, the object and the detector plane are applied. While the
constraint in the detector plane employed in most phase retrieval methods
requires the amplitude of the complex wave to be equal to the squared root of
the measured intensity, we propose a novel Fourier-domain constraint, based on
an analogy to holography. Our method allows achieving a low-resolution
reconstruction already in the first step followed by a high-resolution
reconstruction after further steps. In comparison to conventional schemes this
Fourier-domain constraint results in a fast and reliable convergence of the

regulated by metallicity dependent stellar winds from the newly formed massive
OB stars (Mstar >5 Msol). The model describes the co-evolution of the mass
function of gravitationally bound cores and of the IMF in a protocluster clump.
Dense cores are generated uniformly in time at different locations in the
clump, and contract over lifetimes that are a few times their free fall times.
The cores collapse to form stars that power strong stellar winds whose
cumulative kinetic energy evacuates the gas from the clump and quenches further
core and star formation. This sets the final star formation efficiency, SFEf.
Models are run with various metallicities in the range Z/Zsol=[0.1,2]. We find
that the SFEf decreases strongly with increasing metallicity.The
SFEf-metallicity relation is well described by a decaying exponential whose
exact parameters depend weakly on the value of the core formation efficiency.
We find that there is almost no dependence of the SFEf-metallicity relation on
the clump mass. This is due to the fact that an increase (decrease) in the
clump mass leads to an increase (decrease) in the feedback from OB stars which
is opposed by an increase (decrease) in the gravitational potential of the
clump. The clump mass-cluster mass relations we find for all of the different
metallicity cases imply a negligible difference between the exponent of the
mass function of the protocluster clumps and that of the young clusters mass
function. By normalizing the SFEs to their value for the solar metallicity
case, we compare our results to SFE-metallicity relations derived on galactic
scales and find a good agreement. As a by-product of this study, we also
provide ready-to-use prescriptions for the power of stellar winds of main

order to understand the morphology and kinematics of star forming regions in

studied by mapping line emission, as well as the column density and excitation
temperature, which are estimated using rotation diagrams. For a limited number
of positions the parameters are checked with non-LTE models. Furthermore, the
distribution of the methanol abundance is derived in comparison with archival
dust continuum maps. Methanol is detected over a 0.3x0.15 pc area centred on
the Cep A HW2 source, showing an outflow signature. Most of the gas can be
characterized by a moderately warm rotation temperature (30-60K). At the
central position two velocity components are detected with different excitation
characteristics, the first related to the large-scale outflow. The second
component, uniquely detected at the central location, is probably associated
with the maser emission on much smaller scales of 2"". Detailed analysis reveals
that the highest densities and temperatures occur for these inner components.
In the inner region the dust and gas are shown to have different physical
parameters. Abundances of methanol in the range 10E-9 - 10E-7 are inferred,
with the abundance peaking at the maser position. The geometry of the
large-scale methanol is in accordance with previous determinations of the Cep A
geometry, in particular those from methanol masers. The dynamical and chemical
time-scales are consistent with the methanol originating from a single driving
source associated with the HW2 object and the masers in its equatorial region.

as a convergent at lens due to the reversed Snell-Descartes laws of refraction.
NRIM are also known to be able to support a host of surface plasmon states for
both polarizations of light which are responsible for the sub-wavelength image
resolution achieved by a slab of NRIM. A generalized lens theorem provides us
with a class of spatially varying slab lenses satisfying the prerequisite
symmetries to fold the optical space onto itself. This theorem can be derived
using powerful tools of transformational optics. A paradigm of such
complementary media are checkerboards consisting of alternating cells of
positive and negative refractive index that represent a very singular situation
in which the local density of modes at the corners are enormously enhanced. We
have considered several theoretical and numerical aspects of such structured
films including a finite slabs of multi-scale checkerboards of NRIM satisfying
the generalized lens theorem which are host of strongly enhanced
electromagnetic feld. Such checkerboards can be mapped using transformational
optics onto three-dimensional corner lenses consisting of semi-infinite
heterogeneous anisotropic regions of space satisfying the generalized lens
theorem. It is also possible to design three-dimensional checkerboards of
complementary media, the only restriction being that corresponding unfolded
structures in the plane are constrained by the four color theorem. Some of
these meta-surfaces in the plane display thin bridges of complementary media,
and this further enhances their plasmonic response. Since plasmonic metals
mimic the behaviour of NRIM at small length scales, opaque gold films

Basel PD and the chosen Moody's TPMs; and 3) deriving a monthly or quarterly
TPM when the generator matrix does not exist. Given the fact that TPMs and
specifically their PDs are the most important parameters in IRC, it is our view
that banks may need to make discretionary choices regarding their methodology,
with uncertainties well understood and managed.

equation with rational coefficients on the complex line by requiring it to have
regular singularities with fixed exponents at the points of a finite set $P$
and apparent singularities at a finite set $Q$ (disjoint from $P$) determine a
linear system of maximal rank. In addition, we show that certain auxiliary
parameters can also be fixed. This enables us to conclude that the family of
such differential equations is of the expected dimension and to define a
birational map between an open subset of the moduli space of logarithmic
connections with fixed logarithmic points and regular semi-simple residues and
the Hilbert scheme of points on a quasi-projective surface.

insulator in a two-dimensional lattice. The far-field diffraction pattern of
small clouds of a few hundred atoms was imaged while simultaneously laser
cooling the atoms with the probe beams. We describe the position of the
diffraction peaks and the scaling of the peak parameters by a simple analytic
model. In contrast to Bragg scattering, scattering from a single plane yields
diffraction peaks for any incidence angle. We demonstrate the feasibility of
detecting spin correlations via light scattering by artificially creating a
one-dimensional antiferromagnetic order as a density wave and observing the
appearance of additional diffraction peaks.

dimensions and its relation to a diverse range of models arising in
combinatorics, algebraic geometry, integrable systems, low-dimensional gauge
theories, topological string theory and quantum gravity. Its partition function
can be computed by enumerating the contributions from noncommutative instantons
to a six-dimensional cohomological gauge theory, which yields a dynamical
realization of the crystal as a discretization of spacetime at the Planck
scale. We describe analogous relations between a melting crystal model in two
dimensions and N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. We
elaborate on some mathematical details of the construction of the quantum
geometry which combines methods from toric geometry, isospectral deformation
theory and noncommutative geometry in braided monoidal categories. In
particular, we relate the construction of noncommutative instantons to deformed
ADHM data, torsion-free modules and a noncommutative twistor correspondence.
