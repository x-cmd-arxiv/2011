is the role of a background geometry for the structure of quantum field theory.
To some extent the problem can be solved by the principle of local covariance.
The principle of local covariance was originally imposed in order to restrict
the renormalization freedom for quantum field theories on generic spacetimes.
It turned out that it can also be used to implement the request of background
independence. Locally covariant fields then arise as background independent
entities.

of the 21-cm signal to constrain the reionization history and the properties of
the ionizing sources. In order to describe the reionization signal, we employ
either a commonly-used toy model or a structure formation model that
parameterizes the properties of the ionizing sources. If the structure
formation model captures the actual evolution of the reionization signal, then
detecting the signal is somewhat easier than it would be for the toy model;
using the toy model in this case also leads to systematic errors in
reconstructing the reionization history, though a sufficiently sensitive
experiment should be able to distinguish between the two models. We show that
under optimistic assumptions regarding systematic noise and foreground removal,
one-year observations of the global 21-cm spectrum should be able to detect a
wide range of realistic models and measure the main features of the
reionization history while constraining the key properties of the ionizing
sources.

we present a treatment of the orbital-dependent exact-exchange (EXX) energy and

constructed from products of LAPW basis functions, enables a solution of the
optimized-effective-potential (OEP) equation with standard numerical algebraic
tools and without shape approximations for the resulting potential. We find
that the mixed product and LAPW basis sets must be properly balanced to obtain
smooth and converged EXX potentials without spurious oscillations. The
construction and convergence of the exchange potential is analyzed in detail
for diamond. Our all-electron results for C, Si, SiC, Ge, GaAs semiconductors
as well as Ne and Ar noble-gas solids are in very favorable agreement with
plane-wave pseudopotential calculations. This confirms the adequacy of the
pseudopotential approximation in the context of the EXX-OEP formalism and
clarifies a previous contradiction between FLAPW and pseudopotential results.

the weakness of the perturbation theory (PT) approach, that is expansion in
powers of a small parameter $\alpha$, in Quantum Theory. We start with
outlining a general troublesome feature of the main quantum theory instrument,
the perturbation expansion method. The striking issue is that perturbation
series in powers of $\alpha \ll 1$ is not a convergent series. The formal
reason is an essential singularity of quantum amplitude (matrix element)
$C(\alpha)$ at the origin $\alpha=0$. In many physically important cases one
needs some alternative means of theoretical analysis. In particular, this
refers to perturbative QCD (pQCD) in the low-energy domain. In the second
section-lecture, we discuss the approach of Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT).
We start with a short historic preamble and then discuss how combining the
Dispersion Relation with the Renormalization Group (RG) techniques yields the
APT with \myMath{\displaystyle e^{-1/\alpha}} nonanalyticity. Next we consider
the results of APT applications to low-energy QCD processes and show that in
this approach the fourth-loop contributions, which appear to be on the
asymptotic border in the pQCD approach, are of the order of a few per mil. Then
we note that using the RG in QCD dictates the need to use the Fractional APT
(FAPT) and describe its basic ingredients. As an example of the FAPT
application in QCD we consider the pion form factor $F_\pi(Q^2)$ calculation.
At the end, we discuss the resummation of nonpower series in {(F)APT} with
application to the estimation of the Higgs-boson-decay width
$\Gamma_{H\to\bar{b}b}(m_H^2)$.

non-perturbative formula for the mass. We carry out the analysis in detail in
the context of gauge mediation, where we find that the pseudo-Goldstino mass is
at least around the GeV scale and can be easily at the electroweak range, even
in low scale models. This leads to interesting and unconventional possibilities
in collider physics and it also has potential applications in cosmology.

equations of structure. In this work we provide a brief review of the Newtonian

numerical integration of the Lane-Emden equation, and we used our results which
can also be used to study the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs. However,
Newtonian physics cannot correctly describe very compact and massive objects.
There is an upper mass limit for neutron stars, supported by observations,
which is not predicted by the Newtonian equations. Neutron stars are best
described under the framework of General Relativity. The introduction of the
TOV equations (as well as the relativistic Lane-Emden equations) is, therefore,
necessary to correctly identify stable and non-stable models via the

structures based on a set of complex query computations. They express the
semantics of view-based mappings between databases. The higher (logical) level
scheme mappings between databases, usually written in some high expressive
logical language, may be functorially translated into this base ""computation""
DB category . The behavioral point of view for databases is assumed, with
behavioural equivalence of databases corresponding to isomorphism of objects in
DB category. The introduced observations, which are view-based computations
without side-effects, are based (from Universal algebra) on monad endofunctor
T, which is the closure operator for objects and for morphisms also. It was
shown that DB is symmetric (with a bijection between arrows and objects)
2-category, equal to its dual, complete and cocomplete. In this paper we
demonstrate that DB is concrete, locally small and finitely presentable.
Moreover, it is enriched over itself monoidal symmetric category with a tensor
products for matching, and has a parameterized merging database operation. We
show that it is an algebraic lattice and we define a database metric space and
a subobject classifier: thus, DB category is a monoidal elementary topos.

iron-based superconductors with spin-density-wave (SDW) order are investigated
as a function of doping and impurity scattering strength. In the undoped
sample, where a pure SDW state exists, two impurity-induced resonance peaks are
observed around the impurity site and they are shifted to higher (lower)
energies as the strength of the positive (negative) scattering potential (SP)
is increased. For the doped samples where the SDW order and the superconducting
order coexist, the main feature is the existence of sharp in-gap resonance
peaks whose positions and intensity depend on the strength of the SP and the
doping concentration. In all cases, the local density of states exhibits clear
$C_2$ symmetry. We also note that in the doped cases, the impurity will divide
the system into two sublattices with distinct values of magnetic order. Here we
use the band structure of a two-orbital model, which considers the asymmetry of
the As atoms above and below the Fe-Fe plane. This model is suitable to study
the properties of the surface layers in the iron-pnictides and should be more
appropriate to describe the scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.

toward a star forming region in OMC-2. Based on our adopted Zeeman splitting
factor of z = 1.0 Hz/mG, we detect a line of sight magnetic field of 18.4 +/-
1.1 mG toward this source. Since such 44 GHz methanol masers arise from shocks
in the outflows of star forming regions, we can relate our measurement of the
post-shock magnetic field to field strengths indicated by species tracing
pre-shock regions, and thus characterize the large scale magnetic field.
Moreover, since Class I masers trace regions more remote from the star forming
core than Class II masers, and possibly earlier phases, magnetic fields
detected in 6.7 GHz Class II and 36 GHz and 44 GHz Class I methanol maser lines
together offer the potential of providing a more complete picture of the
magnetic field. This motivates further observations at high angular resolution
to find the positional relationships between Class I and Class II masers, and
masers at various frequencies within each category. In particular, methanol
masers are widespread in high- as well as intermediate-mass star forming
regions, and our discovery provides a new method of studying the magnetic field
in such regions, by observing small physical scales that are not accessible by
any other lines.

symbols emitted by a source with a geometric probability distribution of
parameter $q$, $0{<}q{<}1$. By encoding pairs of symbols, it is possible to
reduce the redundancy penalty of symbol-by-symbol encoding, while preserving
the simplicity of the encoding and decoding procedures typical of Golomb codes
and their variants. It is shown that optimal codes for these so-called
two-dimensional geometric distributions are \emph{singular}, in the sense that
a prefix code that is optimal for one value of the parameter $q$ cannot be
optimal for any other value of $q$. This is in sharp contrast to the
one-dimensional case, where codes are optimal for positive-length intervals of
the parameter $q$. Thus, in the two-dimensional case, it is infeasible to give
a compact characterization of optimal codes for all values of the parameter
$q$, as was done in the one-dimensional case. Instead, optimal codes are
characterized for a discrete sequence of values of $q$ that provide good
coverage of the unit interval. Specifically, optimal prefix codes are described
for $q=2^{-1/k}$ ($k\ge 1$), covering the range $q\ge 1/2$, and $q=2^{-k}$
($k>1$), covering the range $q<1/2$. The described codes produce the expected
reduction in redundancy with respect to the one-dimensional case, while

Space Telescope and they are searched for X-ray and [O III], 5007Angstrom
fluxes from the literature. We use the strength of the [O IV], 25.9um emission
line as tracer for the intrinsic AGN strength. After normalization by [O IV]
the observed X-ray flux provides information about X-ray absorption. The
distribution of X-ray / [O IV] flux ratios is significantly different for
masers and non-masers: The maser detected Seyfert-2s (Sy 1.8-2.0) populate a
distinct X-ray / [O IV] range which is, on average, about a factor four lower
than the range of Seyfert-2 non-masers and about a factor of ten lower than the
range of Seyfert-1s (Sy 1.0-1.5). Non-masers are almost equally distributed
over the entire X-ray / [O IV] range. This provides evidence that high nuclear
obscuration plays a crucial role for the probability of maser detection.
Furthermore, after normalization with [O IV], we find a similar but weaker
trend for the distribution of the maser detection rate with the absorption of
the 7um dust continuum. This suggests that the obscuration of the 7 um
continuum occurs on larger spatial scales than that of the X-rays. Hence, in
the AGN unified model, at moderate deviation from edge-on, the 7um dust
absorption may occur without proportionate X-ray absorption. The absorption of
[O III] appears unrelated to maser detections. The failure to detect masers in
obscured AGN is most likely due to insufficient observational sensitivity.

mid-transit times, the ephemeris was refined to BJD(TDB)=(2454508.97682 +/-
0.00020) + (1.09142245 +/- 0.00000033) E. Interestingly, indications of transit
timing variation are detected at the level of 3.4 sigma. This signal can be
induced by an additional planet in the system. Simplified numerical simulations
shows that a perturber could be a terrestrial-type planet if both planets are
in a low-order orbital resonance. However, we emphasise that further
observations are needed to confirm variation and to constrain properties of the
perturber.

allows for many generalizations toward an increasingly realistic description of

the agents have intrinsic heterogeneities in their social behavior, or where
dynamic variations of the local number of individuals are included. Finally we
propose this model as a very flexible framework to investigate how dynamical

The level spacing of the nuclear sublevels is exponentially small in the middle

the ejecta. There is also a sudden drop in optical brightness after day 339,

formation, may have been detected in the mid-IR photometry of SN 2007it. The
optical spectra show stronger than average [O I] emission lines and weaker than
average [Ca II] lines, which may indicate a 16 - 27 M$_{\sun}$ progenitor, on

also seen in the optical spectra, most likely caused by an asymmetric blob or a

Interaction with circumstellar material prior to day 540 may have created a
cool dense shell between the forward and reverse shocks where new dust is
condensing. At late times there is also a flattening of the visible lightcurve

galaxies. Comparisons of the photometry and major-axis gas and stellar
kinematics of these bulges to simulations of bar formation and evolution
indicate that they are bars viewed in projection. If the properties of boxy
bulges can be entirely explained by assuming they are bars, then this may imply
that their hosts are pure disc galaxies with no classical bulge. A handful of
these bulges, including that of the Milky Way, have been observed to rotate
cylindrically, i.e. with a mean stellar velocity independent of height above
the disc. In order to assess whether such behaviour is ubiquitous in boxy
bulges, and whether a pure disc interpretation is consistent with their stellar
populations, we have analysed the stellar kinematics and populations of the
boxy or peanut-shaped bulges in a sample of five edge-on galaxies. We placed
slits along the major axis of each galaxy and at three offset but parallel
positions to build up spatial coverage. The boxy bulge of NGC3390 rotates
perfectly cylindrically within the spatial extent and uncertainties of the
data. This is consistent with the metallicity and alpha-element enhancement of
the bulge, which are the same as in the disk. This galaxy is thus a pure disc
galaxy. The boxy bulge of ESO311-G012 also rotates very close to cylindrically.
The boxy bulge of NGC1381 is neither clearly cylindrically nor
non-cylindrically rotating, but it has a negative vertical metallicity gradient
and is alpha-enhanced with respect to its disc, suggesting a composite bulge
comprised of a classical bulge and bar (and possibly a discy pseudobulge)
[abridged] Even this relatively small sample is sufficient to demonstrate that
boxy bulges display a range of rotational and population properties, indicating
that they do not form a homogeneous class of object.

from the observed mass-radius relationship of their donor stars. Along the way,
we update the semi-empirical CV donor sequence of Knigge (2006) and present a
comprehensive review of the link between CV evolution and donor physics. After
calibrating state-of-the art stellar models for use in the CV setting, we fit
self-consistent theoretical evolution sequences to the observed donor masses
and radii. In the standard model of CV evolution, AML below the period gap is
assumed to be driven solely by gravitational radiation (GR), while AML above
the gap is usually described by a magnetic braking prescription due to
Rappaport, Verbunt & Joss (1983). We find that simple scaled versions of these
recipes match the data quite well. However, the optimal scaling factors turn
out to be f_GR = 2.47 +/- 0.22 below the gap and f_MB = 0.66 +/- 0.05 above.
The implications and applications of our results include: (1) The revised
evolution sequence yields correct locations for the CV minimum period and the
upper edge of the period gap; the standard sequence does not. (2) A comparison
of predicted and observed WD temperatures suggests an even higher value for
f_GR, but this is sensitive to the assumed WD mass. (3) The absolute donor
magnitudes predicted by our sequences can be used to set firm lower limits on
the distances toward CVs. (4) Both standard and revised sequences predict that
short-period CVs should be susceptible to dwarf nova (DN) eruptions, consistent
with observations. However, both sequences also predict that the DNe fraction
among long-period CVs should decline with P_orb. Observations suggest the
opposite behaviour. (5) The ratio of long-period CVs to short-period,
pre-bounce CV is about 3x higher for the revised sequence than the standard
one. This may resolve a long-standing problem in CV evolution. [abridged]

In this paper, we outline their construction and derive the necessary

A+6731 \deg A)/H{\alpha} with the newly available narrowband images from the
Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We produce the
diagnostic diagram on a pixel-by-pixel (0.2"" x 0.2"") basis and compare it with
several photo- and shock-ionization models. For the photo-ionized gas, we
observe a gradual increase of the log([O III]/H{\beta}) ratios from the center
to the spiral arm, consistent with the metallicity gradient, as the H II
regions go from super solar abundance to roughly solar abundance from the
center out. Using the diagnostic diagram, we separate the photo-ionized from
the shock-ionized component of the gas. We find that the shock-ionized
H{\alpha} emission ranges from ~2% to about 15-33% of the total, depending on
the separation criteria used. An interesting feature in the diagnostic diagram
is an horizontal distribution around log([O III]/H{\beta}) ~ 0. This feature is
well fit by a shock-ionization model with 2.0 Z\odot metallicity and shock
velocities in the range of 250 km/s to 350 km/s. A low velocity shock
component, < 200 km/s, is also detected, and is spatially located at the
boundary between the outer ring and the spiral arm. The low velocity shock
component can be due to : 1) supernova remnants located nearby, 2) dynamical
interaction between the outer ring and the spiral arm, 3) abnormal line ratios
from extreme local dust extinction. The current data do not enable us to
distinguish among those three possible interpretations. Our main conclusion is
that, even at the HST resolution, the shocked gas represents a small fraction
of the total ionized gas emission at less than 33% of the total. However, it
accounts for virtually all of the mechanical energy produced by the central
starburst in M83.

sensitive local resources, making it difficult for remote systems to have any
trust in the provenance of network connections they receive. Even within the
phone, different apps with different privileges can communicate with one
another, allowing one app to trick another into improperly exercising its
privileges (a Confused Deputy attack). In Quire, we engineered two new security
mechanisms into Android to address these issues. First, we track the call chain
of IPCs, allowing an app the choice of operating with the diminished privileges
of its callers or to act explicitly on its own behalf. Second, a lightweight
signature scheme allows any app to create a signed statement that can be
verified anywhere inside the phone. Both of these mechanisms are reflected in
network RPCs, allowing remote systems visibility into the state of the phone
when an RPC is made. We demonstrate the usefulness of Quire with two example
applications. We built an advertising service, running distinctly from the app
which wants to display ads, which can validate clicks passed to it from its
host. We also built a payment service, allowing an app to issue a request which
the payment service validates with the user. An app cannot not forge a payment
request by directly connecting to the remote server, nor can the local payment
service tamper with the request.

quantities in different fields. The Wiener process is the simplest stochastic
processwith continuous variables, and important results can be explicitly found
from it. The presence of a constant drift does not modify its simplicity;
however, when the process has a time-dependent component the analysis becomes
difficult. In this work we analyze the statistical properties of the Wiener
process with an absorbing boundary, under the effect of an exponential
time-dependent drift. Based on the backward Fokker-Planck formalism we set the
time-inhomogeneous equation and conditions that rule the diffusion of the
corresponding survival probability.We propose as the solution an expansion

of recurrence equations. We explicitly solve the expansion up to second order

  work of P. Renteln added",,,,"math.CO math.PR math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  (Abridged abstract) For a finite real reflection group W and a W-orbit O of
flats in its reflection arrangement---or equivalently a conjugacy class of its
parabolic subgroups---we introduce a statistic on elements of W. We then study
the operator of right-multiplication within the group algebra of W by the
element whose coefficients are given by this statistic.
  We reinterpret the operators geometrically in terms of the arrangement of
reflecting hyperplanes for W. We show that they are self-adjoint and positive
semidefinite. via two explicit factorizations into a symmetrized form A^t A. In
one such factorization, A is a generalization of the projection of a simplex
onto the linear ordering polytope. In the other factorization, A is the
transition matrix for one of the well-studied Bidigare-Hanlon-Rockmore random
walks on the chambers of an arrangement.
  We study the family of operators in which O is the conjugacy classes of Young
subgroups of type (k,1^{n-k}). A special case within this family is the
operator corresponding to random-to-random shuffling. We show in a purely
enumerative fashion that these operators pairwise commute. We furthermore
conjecture that they have integer spectrum, generalizing a conjecture of
Uyemura-Reyes for the case k=n-1.
  We use representation theory to show that if O is a conjugacy class of rank
one parabolics in W, the corresponding operator has integer spectrum. Our proof
makes use of an (apparently) new family of twisted Gelfand pairs for W.
  We also study the family of operators in which O is the conjugacy classes of
Young subgroups of type (2^k,1^{n-2k}). Here the construction of a Gelfand
model for the symmetric group shows that these operators pairwise commute and
that they have integer spectrum.
  For the symmetric group, we conjecture that apart from the two commuting
families above, no other pair of operators of this form commutes.

to the intrinsic limitations of the unpolarized measurements. Early

Distinctive capability of analog-to-digital conversion enables us to construct
a CCD camera body that outputs only digital signals. As the result of the
front-end electronics test, it works properly with low input noise of =<30 uV
at the pixel rate below 100 kHz. The power consumption is sufficiently low of
about 150 mW/chip. The input signal range of 720 mV covers the effective energy
range of the typical X-ray photon counting CCD (up to 20 keV). The integrated
non-linearity is 0.2% that is similar as those of the conventional CCDs in
orbit. We also performed a radiation tolerance test against the total ionizing
dose (TID) effect and the single event effect. The irradiation test using 60Co
and proton beam showed that the ASIC has the sufficient tolerance against TID
up to 200 krad, which absolutely exceeds the expected amount of dose during the
period of operating in a low-inclination low-earth orbit. The irradiation of Fe
ions with the fluence of 5.2x10^8 Ion/cm2 resulted in no single event latchup

combines several collision events into a single timestep in order to retain the
instantaneous collisions of event-driven dynamics but also be able to handle
dense packings. However, it is poorly characterized as to its regime of
validity and failure modes. We present a modification of this method to reduce
the introduction of overlap error, and test it using the problem of 2D granular
Couette flow, a densely packed system that has been well-characterized by
previous work. We find that this method can successfully replicate the results
of previous work up to the point of jamming, and that it can do so a factor of
10 faster than comparable MD methods.

system for maximizing the sum-rate under an outage constraint at the primary
system. We formulate the power optimization problem in various scenarios
depending on the availability of channel state information and the type of
power constraints, and propose a set of simple solutions. Finally, the
analytical results are confirmed by simulations, indicating both the accuracy

ballistic infall of the molecular matters in rotating core collapse. Collisions
of these infalling matters lead to formation of strong supersonic shocks, which
if they cool rapidly, result in accumulation of that material in a thin
structure in the equatorial plane. Here, we investigate the relaxation time of
the protostellar accretion post-shock gas using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH). For this purpose, a one-dimensional head-on collision of
two molecular sheets is considered, and the time evolution of the temperature
and density of the post-shock region simulated. The results show that in strong
supersonic shocks, the temperature of the post-shock gas quickly increases
proportional to square of the Mach number, and then gradually decreases
according to the cooling processes. Using a suitable cooling function shows
that in appropriate time-scale, the center of the collision, which is at the
equatorial plane of the core, is converted to a thin dense molecular disk,
together with atomic and ionized gases around it. This structure for accretion
disks may justify the suitable conditions for grain growth and formation of
proto-planetary entities.

access scheme to the MAC frame. In CSA, the burst a generic user wishes to
transmit in the MAC frame is first split into segments, and these segments are
then encoded through a local a packet-oriented code prior to transmission. On
the receiver side, iterative interference cancellation combined with decoding
of the local code is performed to recover from collisions. The new scheme
generalizes the previously proposed irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA)
technique, based on a simple repetition of the users' bursts. An interpretation
of the CSA interference cancellation process as an iterative erasure decoding
process over a sparse bipartite graph is identified, and the corresponding
density evolution equations derived. Based on these equations, asymptotically
optimal CSA schemes are designed for several rates and their performance for a
finite number of users investigated through simulation and compared to IRSA
competitors. Throughputs as high as 0.8 are demonstrated. The new scheme turns
out to be a good candidate in contexts where power efficiency is required.

brightness stellar haloes that extend out to ~100 kpc and beyond. The diffuse

the Milky Way, M31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density, surface
brightness, and metallicity profiles. We show that in situ star formation
typically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of r < 30 kpc,
whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origin
induces a change in slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles,
which is also present in the observational data. The system-to-system scatter
in the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans over
a factor of 4. Consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shape
and normalisation of the spheroid density profile within r < 30 kpc (e.g., when
fit by a spherical powerlaw profile the indices range from -2.6 to -3.4). We
show that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formation
epoch of the system. Dynamically older systems have, on average, larger
contributions from in situ star formation, although there is significant
system-to-system scatter in this relationship. Thus, in situ star formation
likely represents the solution to the longstanding failure of pure
