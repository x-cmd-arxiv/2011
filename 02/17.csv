theoretical proposal where the Higgs-boson Yukawa couplings are radiatively
generated, keeping unchanged the standard-model mechanism for
electroweak-gauge-symmetry breaking. Fermion masses arise at a large energy
scale through an unknown mechanism, and the standard model at the electroweak
scale is regarded as an effective field theory. In this scenario, Higgs boson
decays into photons and electroweak gauge-boson pairs are considerably enhanced
for a light Higgs boson, which makes a signal observation at the LHC
straightforward. On the other hand, the clean environment of a linear collider
is required to directly probe the radiative fermionic sector of the Higgs boson
couplings. Also, we show that the flavor-changing Higgs-boson decays are
dramatically enhanced with respect to the standard model. In particular, we
find a measurable branching ratio in the range (10^{-4}-10^{-3}) for the decay
H\to bs for a Higgs boson lighter than 140 GeV, depending on the high-energy
scale where Yukawa couplings vanish. We present a detailed analysis of the
Higgs boson production cross sections at linear colliders for interesting decay
signatures, as well as branching-ratio correlations for different
flavor-conserving/nonconserving fermionic decays.

the ten known eclipsing X-ray binary pulsars OAO 1657-415 becomes the ninth

approach one to another in a linear chain of spheres interacting via the Hertz
potential. When these counter propagating waves collide, they cross each other
and a phase shift respect to the noninteracting waves is introduced, as a
result of the nonlinear interaction potential. This observation is well
reproduced by our numerical simulations and it is shown to be independent of
viscoelastic dissipation at the beads contact. In addition, when the collision
of equal amplitude and synchronized counter propagating waves takes place, we
observe that two secondary solitary waves emerge from the interacting region.
The amplitude of secondary solitary waves is proportional to the amplitude of
incident waves. However, secondary solitary waves are stronger when the
collision occurs at the middle contact in chains with even number of beads.
Although numerical simulations correctly predict the existence of these waves,
experiments show that their respective amplitude are significantly larger than
predicted. We attribute this discrepancy to the rolling friction at the beads
contacts during solitary wave propagation.

the eavesdropper (Eve) is assumed to be in control of the source, and she sends
pulses correlated in polarization (but not entangled) containing several
photons at frequencies for which only multiple-photon absorptions are possible
in Alice's and Bob's detectors. Whenever the photons stemming from one pulse
are dispatched in such a way that the number of photons is insufficient to
trigger a multiple-photon absorption in either channel, the pulse remains
undetected. We show that this simple feature is enough to reproduce the type of
statistics on the detected pulses that are considered as indicating a secure
quantum key distribution, even though the source is actually a mixture of
separable states. The violation of Bell inequalities measured by Alice and Bob
increases with the order of the multiple-photon absorption that Eve can drive
into their detectors, while the measured quantum bit error rate decreases as a
function of the same variable. We show that the attack can be successful even

the Georgian Chronicle [1] (Kaukhchishvili, 1955) it is stated that this event
is connected with the adoption of Christianity by King Mirian. Once he was
hunting somewhere between Mtskheta (the ancient capital of Georgia) and
Khashuri, near Mt. Tkhoti in dense woodland. It rapidly got dark and the Sun
disappeared from the sky. Mirian began to ask his traditional pagan gods, but
to no avail. Then he addressed the god whom Nino from Cappadocia believed in
(subsequently she became Saint Nino, a woman whose name is inseparably linked
with the spread of Christianity in Georgia) and there was a miracle; the
darkness suddenly disappeared and the Sun began shining in the sky again. Then
Mirian turned to the East and thanked ""Nino's god"". In the authors' opinion,
the eclipse seen by King Mirian happened on the evening of 6 May, 319 AD.
Later, in May 320 AD, cypress crosses were made and raised. Thus, we have
answered the question raised 70 years ago by the Georgian historian Ivane
Javakhishvili about the occurrence of a total solar eclipse in Georgia in the
fourth century. The eclipse seen by King Mirian happened on the evening of 6
May, 319 AD. Later, in May 320 AD, cypress crosses were raised and Christianity
was become the state religion of Georgia.

moderate and large code lengths. To overcome this problem, Vontobel et al.
developed an iterative Low-Complexity LP (LCLP) decoding algorithm for binary
LDPC codes. The variable and check node calculations of binary LCLP decoding
algorithm are related to those of binary Belief Propagation (BP). The present
authors generalized this work to derive an iterative LCLP decoding algorithm
for nonbinary linear codes. Contrary to binary LCLP, the variable and check
node calculations of this algorithm are in general different from that of
nonbinary BP. The overall complexity of nonbinary LCLP decoding is linear in
block length; however the complexity of its check node calculations is
exponential in the check node degree. In this paper, we propose a modified BCJR
algorithm for efficient check node processing in the nonbinary LCLP decoding

A wireless network is

vertex we have a certain number of requests, and each of those requests must be
assigned a different frequency. Edges represent conflicts between cells,
meaning that frequencies in adjacent vertices must be different as well. The
objective is to minimize the total number of used frequencies.
  The offline version of the problem is known to be NP-hard. In the incremental
version, requests for frequencies arrive over time and the algorithm is
required to assign a frequency to a request as soon as it arrives. Competitive
incremental algorithms have been studied for several classes of graphs. For
paths, the optimal (asymptotic) ratio is known to be 4/3, while for
hexagonal-cell graphs it is between 1.5 and 1.9126. For k-colorable graphs, the
ratio of (k+1)/2 can be achieved.

ratio for bipartite graphs, showing that it is between 1.428 and 1.433. This
improves the previous lower bound of 4/3 and upper bound of 1.5. Our proofs are

static networks, such a solution is impractical for networks with high

algorithm to detect separation from the base station. The algorithm consists of
an averaging scheme in which every node updates a scalar state by communicating
with its current neighbors. We prove that if a node is permanently disconnected
from the base station, its state converges to $0$. If a node is connected to
the base station in an average sense, even if not connected in any instant,
then we show that the expected value of its state converges to a positive
number. Therefore, a node can detect if it has been separated from the base
station by monitoring its state. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated through simulations, a real system implementation and experiments

subsample of 2,656 elliptical galaxies from SDSS, whereas at higher redshift
(up to z~1) we extracted a sample of 228 object from the HST/ACS images of the
GOODS. All the galaxies in our study have spectroscopic data, allowing us to
determine the age and mass of the stellar component. Using the fossil record
information contained in the stellar populations of our local sample, we do not
find any evidence for an age segregation at a given stellar mass depending on
the size of the galaxies. At a fixed dynamical mass there is only a <9% size
difference in the two extreme age quartiles of our sample. Consequently, the
local evidence does not support a scenario whereby the present-day mass-size
relation has been progressively established via a bottom-up sequence, where
older galaxies occupy the lower part this relation, remaining in place since
their formation. We find a trend in size that is insensitive to the age of the
stellar populations, at least since z~1. This result supports the idea that the
stellar mass-size relation is formed at z~1, with all galaxies populating a
region which roughly corresponds to 1/2 of the present size distribution. The
fact that the evolution in size is independent of stellar age, together with
the absence of an increase in the scatter of the relationship with redshift
does not support the puffing up mechanism. The observational evidence, however,
can not reject at this stage the minor merging hypothesis. We have made an
estimation of the number of minor merger events necessary to bring the high-z
galaxies into the local relation compatible with the observed size evolution.
Since z=0.8, if the merger mass ratio is 1:3 we estimate ~3+-1 minor mergers

to a Liouville operator space whose dimension scales only as N^2, leading to a
slow growth of multi-spin correlations. Even though long-range couplings are
present in the real system, we find excellent agreement between the analytical
predictions and our experimental results, confirming that leakage out of the
restricted Liouville space is slow on the timescales investigated. Our results
indicate that the group velocity of the magnetization is 6.04 +/- 0.38 um/s,
corresponding to a coherent transport over N ~ 26 spins on the experimental
timescale. As the double-quantum Hamiltonian is related to the standard
one-dimensional XX Hamiltonian by a similarity transform, our results can be
directly extended to XX quantum spin chains, which have been extensively
studied in the context of both quantum magnetism and quantum information
processing.

predicted so far come from a model [K. Ioka, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 327,

global reconfiguration, changing the hydromagnetic equilibrium structure of the
star and tapping the gravitational potential energy without changing the
magnetic potential energy. The largest energies in this model assume very
special conditions, including a large change in moment of inertia (which was
observed in at most one flare), a very high internal magnetic field, and a very

regularization and show that the asymptotic symmetry becomes the desirable
non-chiral Virasoro symmetry with the same central charges for both left and
right sectors, which are independent of the regularization parameter. We then
investigate the non-chiral extension for general extremal black holes in the
zero entropy limit. Since the same geometric structure as above emerges in this
limit, we identify non-chiral Virasoro symmetry by a similar procedure. This
observation supports the existence of a hidden non-chiral CFT_2 structure with
the same central charges for both left and right sectors dual to the rotating
black holes.

homogeneous populations, mainly described my the Moran process. Recently, this
approach has been generalized in \cite{LHN} by arranging individuals on the
nodes of a network. Undirected networks seem to have a smoother behavior than
directed ones, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers
of selection. In this paper we present the first class of undirected graphs
which act as suppressors of selection, by achieving a fixation probability that
is at most one half of that of the complete graph, as the number of vertices
increases. Moreover, we provide some generic upper and lower bounds for the
fixation probability of general undirected graphs. As our main contribution, we
introduce the natural alternative of the model proposed in \cite{LHN}, where
all individuals interact simultaneously and the result is a compromise between
aggressive and non-aggressive individuals. That is, the behavior of the
individuals in our new model and in the model of \cite{LHN} can be interpreted
as an ""aggregation"" vs. an ""all-or-nothing"" strategy, respectively. We prove
that our new model of mutual influences admits a \emph{potential function},
which guarantees the convergence of the system for any graph topology and any
initial fitness vector of the individuals. Furthermore, we prove fast
convergence to the stable state for the case of the complete graph, as well as
we provide almost tight bounds on the limit fitness of the individuals. Apart
from being important on its own, this new evolutionary model appears to be
useful also in the abstract modeling of control mechanisms over invading
populations in networks. We demonstrate this by introducing and analyzing two
alternative control approaches, for which we bound the time needed to stabilize
to the ""healthy"" state of the system.

crucial FIR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) in accurately measuring
galaxy SED across the peak of the dust emission at ~100um. By fitting modern IR
SED models to the AKARI photometry, we measured the total infrared luminosity
(L_IR) of individual galaxies more accurately. Using this L_IR, we constructed
luminosity functions of infrared galaxies at a median redshift of z=0.031, with
4 times larger sample than previous work. The LF agrees well with that at
z=0.0082 (RBGS), showing smooth and continuous evolution toward higher redshift
LFs measured in the AKARI NEP deep field. The derived local cosmic IR
luminosity density is Omega_IR=3.8x10^8 LsunMpc^-3. We separate galaxies into
AGN, star-forming, and composite by using the [NII]/Ha vs [OIII]/Hb line
ratios. The fraction of AGN shows a continuous increase with increasing L_IR
from 25% to 90% at 9<log L_IR<12.5. The SFR_Ha and L_[OIII] show good
correlations with L_IR for SFG (star-forming galaxies) and AGN, respectively.
The self-absorption corrected Ha/Hb ratio shows a weak increase with L_IR with
a substantial scatter. When we separate IR LFs into contributions from AGN and
SFG, the AGN contribution becomes dominant at L_IR>10^11Lsun, coinciding the
break of the both SFG and AGN IR LFs. At L_IR<10^11Lsun, SFG dominates IR Lfs.
Only 1.1% of Omega_IR is produced by LIRG, and only 0.03% is by ULIRG in the
local Universe. This work also provides the most accurate infrared luminosity
density of the local Universe to date. Compared with high redshift results from

result by comparing the elliptical galaxy spectra to those of luminous globular
clusters associated with M31. These globular clusters have similar
metallicities, abundance ratios and ages as massive elliptical galaxies but
their low dynamical mass-to-light ratios rule out steep stellar initial mass
functions (IMFs). From high quality Keck spectra we find that the

averaged globular cluster spectrum from the averaged elliptical galaxy
spectrum. The difference spectrum is well fit by the difference between a
stellar population synthesis model with a bottom-heavy IMF and one with a
bottom-light IMF. We speculate that the slope of the IMF may vary with velocity
dispersion, although it is not yet clear what physical mechanism would be
responsible for such a relation.

distance to the center of each galaxy we find pairs of lenses on small to
intermediate mass scales which approach at large radii the same values for
their enclosed total mass but exhibit very different stellar masses and stellar
baryon fractions. This behaviour subsides for the most massive lenses. All
baryon fraction profiles show that the dark matter halo overtakes the stellar

steadily declining over the full mass range. We shed light on the Fundamental
Plane puzzle by showing that the slope of the ML(<R)-to-Ms(<R) relation
approaches the mass-to-light relation of recent Fundamental Plane studies at
large radii. Less massive dark matter halos turn out to be influenced by the

subhaloes (compared to the primary halo) allows us to use the epicyclic
approximation, the equations of which we solve by modal analysis, i.e.,
assuming a disc is composed of N radial rings with M modes. We show that
properties of dark matter subhaloes can be inferred from the profile and
amplitude of the modal energy of the disc. Namely, we find that the overall
amplitude of the response gives the mass of the dark sub-halo. Motivated by
this modal analysis, we then show that the density response shows similar
features. Finally, we show that our results agree with those from full
hydrodynamic simulation. We find a simple scaling relation between the
satellite mass and Fourier amplitudes of the resultant surface density of the
gas disc where the effective Fourier amplitude (essentially a sum over the low
order modes) scales as $m_{s}^{1/2}$, where $m_{s}$ is the satellite mass. The
utility of this relation is that it can be readily applied to an observed HI
map to deduce the satellite mass without recourse to full numerical simulation.
This will greatly aid us in analyzing large samples of spiral galaxies to

  Quantum One-Way Function",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a non-interactive quantum bit commitment scheme which has
statistically-hiding and computationally-binding properties from any quantum
one-way function. Our protocol is basically a parallel composition of the
previous non-interactive quantum bit commitment schemes (based on quantum
one-way permutations, due to Dumais, Mayers and Salvail (EUROCRYPT 2000)) with
pairwise independent hash functions. To construct our non-interactive quantum
bit commitment scheme from any quantum one-way function, we follow the
procedure below: (i) from Dumais-Mayers-Salvail scheme to a weakly-hiding and
1-out-of-2 binding commitment (of a parallel variant); (ii) from the
weakly-hiding and 1-out-of-2 binding commitment to a strongly-hiding and
1-out-of-2 binding commitment; (iii) from the strongly-hiding and 1-out-of-2
binding commitment to a normal statistically-hiding commitment. In the
classical case, statistically-hiding bit commitment scheme (by Haitner, Nguyen,
Ong, Reingold and Vadhan (SIAM J. Comput., Vol.39, 2009)) is also constructible
from any one-way function. While the classical statistically-hiding bit
commitment has large round complexity, our quantum scheme is non-interactive,
which is advantageous over the classical schemes. A main technical contribution
is to provide a quantum analogue of the new interactive hashing theorem, due to
Haitner and Reingold (CCC 2007). Moreover, the parallel composition enables us
to simplify the security analysis drastically.

in an initial state and end in a given final state during a certain time

Langevin dynamics. We show that these paths can be exactly generated by a
non-local stochastic differential equation. In the limit of short times, we
show that this complicated non-solvable equation can be simplified into an
approximate stochastic differential equation. For longer times, the paths
generated by this approximate equation can be reweighted to generate the
correct statistics. In all cases, the paths generated by this equation are
statistically independent and provide a representative sample of transition
paths. In case the reaction takes place in a solvent (e.g. protein folding in
water), the explicit solvent can be treated. The method is illustrated on the
one-dimensional quartic oscillator.

at ~2600A, but the results are applicable to other transitions that trace
outflows (e.g. NaI, Lya, SiII). By design, the resonance transitions show
blue-shifted absorption but one also predicts strong resonance and
fine-structure line-emission at roughly the systemic velocity. This
line-emission `fills-in' the absorption reducing the equivalent width by up to
50%, shift the absorption-lin centroid by tens of km/s, and reduce the
effective opacity near systemic. Analysis of cool gas outflows that ignores
this line-emission may incorrectly infer that the gas is partially covered,
measure asignificantly lower peak optical depth, and/or conclude that gas at
systemic velocity is absent. Because the FeII lines are connected by
optically-thin transitions to fine-structure levels, their profiles more
closely reproduce the intrinsic opacity of the wind. Together these results
naturally explain the absorption and emission-line characteristics observed for
star-forming galaxies at z<1. We also study a scenario promoted to describe the
outflows of z~3 Lyman break galaxies and find prfiles inconsistent with the
observations due to scattered photon emission. Although line-emission
complicates the analysis of absorption-line profiles, the surface brightness
profiles offer a unique means of assessing the morphology and size of

sufficiently large times $t > 0$ (with $C$ a positive constant). Consequently,
many fitting arguments solely based on this experimental law were used to
predict the large-time behavior of carbonation fronts in real structures, a
theoretical justification of the $\sqrt{t}$-law being lacking until now. %This
is the place where our paper contributes:
  The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by justifying rigorously the
experimentally guessed asymptotic behavior. We have previously proven the upper
bound $s(t)\leq C'\sqrt{t}$ for some constant $C'$; now we show the optimality
of the rate by proving the right nontrivial lower estimate, i.e. there exists
$C"">0$ such that $s(t)\geq C""\sqrt{t}$. Additionally, we obtain weak solutions

and the Bar, a dynamically complex region where high-velocity streams could
easily collide. The star formation rate of W43 is suggested not to be steady
but it is increasing from $\, \sim 0.01 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from its
$8\,\mu$m luminosity) to $\sim 0.1 \msun\, {yr}^{-1}$ (measured from its
molecular content). From the global properties of W43, we claim it is an
extreme molecular complex in the Milky Way and it could even be forming
starburst clusters in the near future.

on networks of interacting elements: node state change and rewiring of links
between nodes. The process of rewiring is described in terms of two basic
actions: disconnection and reconnection between nodes, both based on a
mechanism of comparison of their states. We assume that the process of rewiring
and node state change occur with probabilities Pr and Pc respectively,
independent of each other. The collective behavior of a coevolutionary system
can be characterized on the space of parameters (Pr, Pc). As an application,
for a voterlike node dynamics we find that reconnections between nodes with
similar states lead to network fragmentation. The critical boundaries for the
onset of fragmentation in networks with different properties are calculated on
this space. We show that coevolution models correspond to curves on this space
describing functional relations between Pr and Pc. The occurrence of a
one-large-domain phase and a fragmented phase in the network is predicted for
diverse models, and agreement is found with some earlier results. The
collective behavior of system is also characterized on the space of parameters

find a behavior where different node states can coexist for very long times on

behavior of solar small-scale magnetic elements is studied. More than 13
million small-scale magnetic elements are selected, and the following results
are unclosed. (1) The quiet regions dominated the Sun\textsf{'}s magnetic flux
for about 8 years in the 12.25 year duration of Cycle 23. They contributed
(0.94 -- 1.44) $\times 10^{23}$ Mx flux to the Sun from the solar minimum to
maximum. The monthly average magnetic flux of the quiet regions is 1.12 times
that of active regions in the cycle. (2) The ratio of quiet region flux to that
of the total Sun equally characterizes the course of a solar cycle. The 6-month
running-average flux ratio of quiet region had been larger than 90.0% for 28
continuous months from July 2007 to October 2009, which characterizes very well
the grand solar minima of Cycles 23-24. (3) From the small to large end of the
flux spectrum, the variations of numbers and total flux of the network elements
show no-correlation, anti-correlation, and correlation with sunspots,
respectively. The anti-correlated elements, covering the flux of (2.9 -
32.0)$\times 10^{18}$ Mx, occupies 77.2% of total element number and 37.4% of
quiet Sun flux. These results provide insight into reason for anti-correlated
variations of small-scale magnetic activity during the solar cycle.

not significantly intersect the disk of M31, means that it is unusually well
suited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a test
for the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. The main result of this
paper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about three
times the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. The probability that
the variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.
As a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the same

find no variations above the expected shot noise. The lumpiness of the stream
is not compatible with a low mass star stream in a smooth galactic potential,
nor is it readily compatible with the disturbance caused by the visible M31
satellite galaxies. The stream's density variations appear to be consistent
with the effects of a large population of steep mass function dark matter

Then, we use SpaceMac as a building block to design a cooperative scheme that
provides complete defense against pollution attacks: (i) it can detect polluted
packets early at intermediate nodes and (ii) it can identify the exact location
of all, even colluding, attackers, thus making it possible to eliminate them.
Our scheme is cooperative: parents and children of any node cooperate to detect
any corrupted packets sent by the node, and nodes in the network cooperate with
a central controller to identify the exact location of all attackers. We
implement SpaceMac in both C/C++ and Java as a library, and we make the library
available online. Our evaluation on both a PC and an Android device shows that
(i) SpaceMac's algorithms can be computed quickly and efficiently, and (ii) our
cooperative defense scheme has low computation and significantly lower

spectrum, the quasinormal modes as the characteristic modes of a black hole
have been used in obtaining the horizon area spectrum of the black hole.
However, the area spectrum of the Kerr black hole in some previous works was
inconsistent with the Bekenstein's proposal. In this paper, noting that black
holes can have three types of resonance modes which are quasinormal modes
(QNM), total transmission modes (TTM), and total reflection modes (TRM), we
propose that all of these modes in highly damped regime should be used in
quantizing the black hole. Although the QNM and the TTM of the Kerr black hole
give us complicated quantization conditions from the Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization of action variable, we find a very simple result from the TRM. It
gives equally spaced outer horizon area. Therefore by Bekenstein-Hawking area
law we find that the Kerr black hole has universal behavior of the equally
spaced entropy spectrum. With the same argument, we find that the
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole also has equally spaced entropy spectrum.

as spatial and polarization inhomogeneity of the light field incident on the
particle. The inhomogeneous incident field is modelled by superposition of two
plane waves, the mechanical action is calculated via the Mie theory for
dielectric and conducting particles of different sizes and optical properties.
It is shown that both spin and orbital components of the field momentum can
produce the mechanical action, which can thus be used for experimental study of
the internal energy flows in light beams. However, exact value and even
direction of the force applied to a particle depends on many details of the
field-particle interaction. Besides, forces that are not associated with any
sort of the energy flow (we attribute them to the gradient force owing to the
inhomogeneous intensity and to the dipole force emerging due to inhomogeneous
polarization) can strongly modify the observed mechanical action. The results
should be taken into account in experiments employing the motion of probing
particles suspended within optical fields. We suppose that situations where an
optical field exerts the polarization-dependent mechanical action on particles
can be treated as a new form of the spin-orbit interaction of light.

When the finite field size is larger than or equal to the number of users, it
is shown that we can always find an encoding vector which is both innovative
and sparse. The sparsity can be utilized in speeding up the decoding process.
An efficient algorithm to generate innovative and sparse encoding vectors is
developed. Simulations show that the delay performance of our scheme with
binary finite field outperforms a number of existing schemes in terms of

general framework for exponential time improvement of \minwise based algorithms

Here we take it a step forward and reduce the space and the independent needed
for representing the functions, by defining and constructing a \dkmin
independent family of hash functions. Surprisingly, for most cases only 8-wise
independent is needed for exponential time and space improvement. Moreover, we
bypass the $O(\log{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$ independent lower bound for
approximately \minwise functions \cite{patrascu10kwise-lb}, as we use
alternative definition. In addition, as the independent's degree is a small
constant it can be implemented efficiently.
  Informally, under this definition, all subsets of size $d$ of any fixed set
$X$ have an equal probability to have hash values among the minimal $k$ values
in $X$, where the probability is over the random choice of hash function from
the family. This property measures the randomness of the family, as choosing a
truly random function, obviously, satisfies the definition for $d=k=|X|$. We
define and give an efficient time and space construction of approximately
\dkmin independent family of hash functions. The degree of independent required
is optimal, i.e. only $O(d)$ for $2 \le d < k=O(\frac{d}{\epsilon^2})$, where
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ is the desired error bound. This construction can be used
to improve many \minwise based algorithms, such as
\cite{sizeEstimationFramework,Datar02estimatingrarity,NearDuplicate,SimilaritySearch,DBLP:conf/podc/CohenK07},
as will be discussed here. To our knowledge such definitions, for hash
functions, were never studied and no construction was given before.

additional tool for the research of cosmological problems. It is demonstrated
how this new approach could be useful in the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data. After a transformation of the anisotropy spectrum of
relict radiation into a special two-fold reciprocal space it was possible to
propose a simple and general description of the interaction of relict photons
with the matter by a ""relict radiation factor"". This factor enabled us to
process the transformed CMB anisotropy spectrum by a Fourier transform and thus
arrive to a radial electron density distribution function (RDF) in a reciprocal
space. As a consequence it was possible to estimate distances between Objects
of the order ~100 [m] and the density of the ordinary matter ~1E-22 [kg.m-3].
Another analysis based on a direct calculation of the CMB radiation spectrum
after its transformation into a simple reciprocal space and combined with
appropriate structure modeling confirmed the cluster structure. The internal
structure of Objects may be formed by Clusters distant 12 [cm], whereas the
internal structure of a Cluster consisted of particles distant ~0.3 [nm]. This
work points unequivocally to clustering processes and to a cluster-like
structure of the matter and thus contributes to the understanding of the
structure of density fluctuations. Simultaneously it sheds more light on the
structure of the universe in the moment when the universe became transparent
for photons. Clustering may be at the same time a new physical effect which has
not been taken fully into consideration in the past. On the basis of our
quantitative considerations it was possible to estimate the number of particles
(protons, helium nuclei, electrons and other particles) in Objects and Clusters
and the number of Clusters in an Object.

enough. Otherwise they coalesce and form a big drop, as one might expect. We
present a theoretical model for this observation, using mean curvature flow.
With the help of appropriate barriers for the flow we can predict the observed

discontinuous involution, and the invariant measure is also discontinuous along

produces a Tall-Wraith monoid. We also study the example of the Tall-Wraith
monoid defined by the self set-maps of a finite ring, an example closely

collapse, such magnetic fields can be amplified by compression and by
turbulence, giving rise to the small-scale dynamo. On scales below the Jeans
length, the eddy turnover timescale is much shorter than the free-fall
timescale, so that saturation can be reached during collapse. This scenario has
been tested and confirmed with magneto-hydrodynamical simulations following the
collapse of a turbulent, weakly magnetized cloud. Based on a spectral analysis,
we confirm that turbulence is injected on the Jeans scale. For the power
spectrum of the magnetic field, we obtain the Kazantsev slope which is
characteristic for the small-scale dynamo. A calculation of the critical length
scales for ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation shows that these scales
are always small enough to allow significant amplification of the magnetic

intractable. However, many of it's special cases are very important in
practical applications. Thus development of algorithms that are applicable to
these special cases is of importance. The practical applicability of such
algorithms can be validated by their ability to solve the problems that are
considered to be computationally hard (for example cryptanalysis problems). In
this article we propose the technology of solving the inversion problem for

distributed computing environments (parallel clusters and Grid-systems). It is
based on reducing the inversion problem for the considered function to some SAT
problem. We describe a general approach to coarse-grained parallelization for

by the means of a special predictive function. The proposed technology was
validated by successful solving of cryptanalysis problems for some keystream

frequency dependent stellar radiation feedback, resolve the dust sublimation
front in the vicinity of the forming star down to 1.27 AU, compute the
evolution for several 10^5 yrs covering the whole accretion phase of the
forming star, and perform a comprehensive survey of the parameter space. The
most fundamental result is that the formation of a massive accretion disk in
slowly rotating cores preserves a high anisotropy in the radiation field. The
thermal radiation escapes through the optically thin atmosphere, effectively
diminishing the radiation pressure feedback onto the accretion flow.
Gravitational torques in the self-gravitating disk drive a sufficiently high
accretion rate to overcome the residual radiation pressure. Simultaneously, the
radiation pressure launches an outflow in the bipolar direction, which grows in
angle with time and releases a substantial fraction of the initial core mass
from the star-disk system. Summarized, for an initial core mass of 60, 120,
240, and 480 Msol these mechanisms allow the star to grow up to 28.2, 56.5,

implementation of random linear network coding, called PNC. In PNC, in contrast
to the classical memoryless setting, nodes store received information in memory
to later produce coded packets that reflect this information. PNC is known to
achieve order optimal stopping times for the many-to-all multicast problem in
many settings.
  We give a reduction that captures exactly how PNC and other network coding
protocols use the memory of the nodes. More precisely, we show that any such
protocol implementation induces a transformation which maps an execution of the
protocol to an instance of the classical memoryless setting. This allows us to
prove that, for any (non-adaptive dynamic) network, PNC converges with high
probability in optimal time. In other words, it stops at exactly the first time
in which in hindsight it was possible to route information from the sources to
each receiver individually.
  Our technique also applies to variants of PNC, in which each node uses only a
finite buffer. We show that, even in this setting, PNC stops exactly within the
time in which in hindsight it was possible to route packets given the memory
constraint, i.e., that the memory used at each node never exceeds its buffer
size. This shows that PNC, even without any feedback or explicit memory
management, allows to keep minimal buffer sizes while maintaining its capacity
achieving performance.

the description of cold plasmas, so that the two schemes are physically
complementary in the large-scale limit and for the low-frequency branch of the

accepted to utlise a Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) paradigm to model the
individual OpRisk loss process corresponding to the Basel II Business
line/event type. In this paper we derive a novel class of doubly stochastic
alpha-stable family LDA models. These models provide the ability to capture the
heavy tailed loss process typical of OpRisk whilst also providing analytic
expressions for the compound process annual loss density and distributions as
well as the aggregated compound process annual loss models. In particular we
develop models of the annual loss process in two scenarios. The first scenario
considers the loss process with a stochastic intensity parameter, resulting in
an inhomogeneous compound Poisson processes annually. The resulting arrival
process of losses under such a model will have independent counts over
increments within the year. The second scenario considers discretization of the
annual loss process into monthly increments with dependent time increments as
captured by a Binomial process with a stochastic probability of success
changing annually. Each of these models will be coupled under an LDA framework
with heavy-tailed severity models comprised of $\alpha$-stable severities for
the loss amounts per loss event. In this paper we will derive analytic results
for the annual loss distribution density and distribution under each of these
models and study their properties.

gravitational radius is larger than $\gtrsim 1.5 \mu$ arcseconds. In the cases
that the inner edge of the disk is located at the radius of the innermost

the theory necessary for analysis of a SA algorithm, which includes Lyapunov
functions and ODE stability theory. Then standard SA results are used to prove
consistency of Newton's estimate in the case of a finite mixture. We also
propose a modification of Newton's algorithm that allows for estimation of an
additional unknown parameter in the model, and prove its consistency.

star system which shows total eclipses and multi-periodic delta Scuti
pulsations. A frequency analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light curve reveals
at least 68 frequencies of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsation
modes. The main limitation on this analysis is the frequency resolution within
the 27-day short-cadence light curve. Most of the variability signal lies in
the frequency range 18 to 31 c/d, with amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag. One
harmonic term (2.f) and a few combination frequencies (f_i+f_j) have been
detected. From a plot of the residuals versus orbital phase we assign the
pulsations to the primary star in the system. The pulsations were removed from
the short-cadence data and the light curve was modelled using the
Wilson-Devinney code. We are unable to get a perfect fit due to the residual
effects of pulsations and also to the treatment of reflection and reprocessing
in the light curve model. A model where the secondary star fills its Roche lobe
is favoured, which means that KIC 10661783 can be classified as an oEA system.
Further photometric and spectroscopic observations will allow the masses and
radii of the two stars to be measured to high precision and hundreds of delta
Scuti pulsation frequencies to be resolved. This could lead to unique
constraints on theoretical models of delta Scuti stars, if the evolutionary
history of KIC 10661783 can be accounted for.

appears to be immeasurably small. However, tests of relativity theory provide
one promising avenue to overcome this phenomenological obstacle: many models
for underlying physics can accommodate a small breakdown of Lorentz symmetry,
and numerous feasible Lorentz-symmetry tests have Planck reach. Such mild
violations of Einstein's relativity have therefore become a focus of recent
research efforts. This presentation provides a brief survey of the key ideas in
this research field and is geared at both experimentalists and theorists. In
particular, several theoretical mechanisms leading to deviations from
relativity theory are presented; the standard theoretical framework for
relativity violations at currently accessible energy scales (i.e., the SME) is

Its complexity is shown to be lower than that of standard techniques when the
degree of the polynomial is large enough. Applications to the syndrome
computation in the decoding of Reed-Solomon codes are highlighted.
