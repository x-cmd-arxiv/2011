into so-called scalar, vector and tensor modes. This decomposition is non-local
and depends on unknowable boundary conditions. The non-locality is particularly
important at second- and higher-order because perturbative modes are sourced by
products of lower-oder modes, which must be integrated over all space in order
to isolate each mode. However, given a trace-free rank-2 tensor, a locally
defined scalar mode may be trivially derived by taking two divergences, which
knocks out the vector and tensor degrees of freedom. A similar local
differential operation will return a pure vector mode. This means that scalar
and vector degrees of freedom have local descriptions. The corresponding local
extraction of the tensor mode is unknown however. We give it here. The
operators we define are useful for defining gauge-invariant quantities at
second-order. We perform much of our analysis using an index-free
`vector-calculus' approach which makes manipulating tensor equations
considerably simpler.

the tail of the distribution of ordinary groups, or whether they are a
physically distinct class of objects, characterized by an unusual and special
formation history. To study this question, we here investigate fossil groups
identified in the hydrodynamical simulations of the GIMIC project, which
consists of resimulations of five regions in the Millennium Simulation (MS)
that are characterized by different large-scale densities, ranging from a deep
void to a proto-cluster region. For comparison, we also consider semi-analytic
models built on top of the MS, as well as a conditional luminosity function
approach. We identify galaxies in the GIMIC simulations as groups of stars and
use a spectral synthesis code to derive their optical properties. The X-ray
luminosity of the groups is estimated in terms of the thermal bremsstrahlung
emission of the gas in the host halos, neglecting metallicity effects. We focus
on comparing the properties of fossil groups in the theoretical models and
observational results, highlighting the differences between them, and trying to
identify possible dependencies on environment for which our approach is
particularly well set-up. We find that the optical fossil fraction in all of
our theoretical models declines with increasing halo mass, and there is no
clear environmental dependence. Combining the optical and X-ray selection
criteria for fossil groups, the halo mass dependence of the fossil groups seen
in optical vanishes. Over the GIMIC halo mass range we resolve best,
9.0\times1012 \sim 4.0\times1013 h-1 M, the central galaxies in the fossil
groups show similar properties as those in ordinary groups, in terms of age,
metallicity, color, concentration, and mass-to-light ratio. [abridged]

centered on gamma ray bursts detected between 2004 and 2008 and observed with
total exposures ranging from 10 ks to over 1 Ms. This defines the Swift
Serendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields, which is quite broad compared to
existing surveys (~33 square degrees) and medium depth, with a faintest flux
limit of 7.2e-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5 to 2 keV energy range. The survey
has a high degree of uniformity thanks to the stable point spread function and
small vignetting correction factors of the XRT, moreover is completely random
on the sky as GRBs explode in totally unrelated parts of the sky. In this paper
we present the sample and the X-ray number counts of the high Galactic-latitude
sample, estimated with high statistics over a wide flux range (i.e., 7.2e-16 to
~5e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band and 3.4e-15 to ~6e-13 erg cm^-2
s^-1 in the 2-10 keV band). We detect 9387 point-like sources, while 7071
point-like sources are found at high Galactic-latitudes (i.e. >=20 deg). The
large number of detected sources resulting from the combination of large area
and deep flux limits make this survey a new important tool for investigating
the evolution of AGN. In particular, the large area permits finding rare
high-luminosity objects like QSO2, which are poorly sampled by other surveys,
adding precious information for the luminosity function bright end. The high
Galactic-latitude logN-logS relation is well determined over all the flux
coverage, and it is nicely consistent with previous results at 1 sigma
confidence level. By the hard X-ray color analysis, we find that the Swift
Serendipitous Survey in deep XRT GRB fields samples relatively unobscured and
mildly obscured AGN, with a fraction of obscured sources of ~37% (~15%) in the
2-10 (0.3-3 keV) band.

half-duplex relay (in which the relay cannot transmit and receive

over the direct transmission (without the relay) is investigated. It is shown
that for the case of finite complex input constellations, the relay gain
attains the maximum at a particular SNR and at higher SNRs the relay gain tends
to become zero. Since practical schemes always use finite complex input
constellation, the above result means that the relay offers maximum advantage
over the direct transmission when we operate at a particular SNR and offers no
advantage at very high SNRs. This is contrary to the results already known for

dilution of Dark Matter (DM) relic densities. This is to be contrasted with
quintessence scenarios in which relic densities are augmented, due to
modification of the expansion rate, since Universe is not radiation dominated
at DM decoupling. Dilaton field, besides this, affects relic densities through
its coupling to dust which tends to decrease relic abundances. Thus two
separate mechanisms compete each other resulting, in general, to a decrease of
the relic density. This feature may be welcome and can rescue the situation if
Direct Dark Matter experiments point towards small neutralino-nucleon cross
sections, implying small neutralino annihilation rates and hence large relic
densities, at least in the popular supersymmetric scenarios. In the presence of
a diluting mechanism both experimental constraints can be met. The role of the
dilaton for this mechanism has been studied in the context of the non-critical
string theory but in this work we follow a rather general approach assuming
that the dilaton dominates only at early eras long before Big Bang

for quantum networks. We report on the experimental generation of remote
entanglement between a single atom inside an optical cavity and a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC). To produce this, a single photon is created in the
atom-cavity system, thereby generating atom-photon entanglement. The photon is
transported to the BEC and converted into a collective excitation in the BEC,
thus establishing matter-matter entanglement. After a variable delay, this
entanglement is converted into photon-photon entanglement. The matter-matter
entanglement lifetime of 100 $\mu$s exceeds the photon duration by two orders
of magnitude. The total fidelity of all concatenated operations is 95%. This
hybrid system opens up promising perspectives in the field of quantum
information.

subdwarf B (sdB) stars observed with the Kepler spacecraft and one observed
with CoRoT. Asymptotic limits for gravity (g-)mode pulsations provide
relationships between equal period spacings of modes with differing degrees and
relationships between periods of the same radial order but differing degrees.
Period transforms, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and linear least-squares fits have
been used to detect and determine the significance of equal period spacings. We
have also used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the likelihood that the
detected spacings could be produced randomly.
  Period transforms for nine of the Kepler stars indicate ell=1 period
spacings, with five also showing peaks for ell=2 modes. 12 stars indicate ell=1
modes using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test while another shows solely ell=2 modes.
Monte Carlo results indicate that equal period spacings are significant in 10
stars above 99% confidence and 13 of the 14 are above 94% confidence. For 12
stars, the various methods find consistent regular period spacing values to
within the errors, two others show some inconsistencies, likely caused by
binarity, and the last has significant detections but the mode assignment
disagrees between methods.
  We find a common ell=1 period spacing spanning a range from 231 to 272 s
allowing us to correlate pulsation modes with 222 periodicities and that the
ell=2 period spacings are related to the ell=1 spacings by the asymptotic
relationship $1/\sqrt{3}$. We briefly discuss the impact of equal period
spacings which indicate low-degree modes with a lack of significant mode
trappings.

  We point out that these observations have natural explanations in the
framework of the Tidal Downsizing hypothesis, a new and an alternative model
for planet formation. We show that disassociation of molecular hydrogen leads
to the ""second collapse"" of the giant planet embryos. The collapse forms much
denser fluid configurations, closely resembling isolated proto-giant planets on
the Hayashi track before they enter the degenerate ""main sequence"" phase. We
find that, in the early gas-rich phase of proto-planetary discs, these
configurations migrate inward more rapidly than they contract. They are
therefore tidally disrupted at characteristic distance of ~ 0.05 -0.1 AU from
their parent stars. The disruption is likely to leave solid cores behind, which
we identify with the hot Super-Earths observed by Kepler. In addition, we show
that single hot jupiters (also found by the Kepler telescope) are not
surprising in the context of TD hypothesis. Finally, formation of coreless
giant planets by the second collapse of the giant embryos occurs for either
very massive embryos (more than ~ 20 Jupiter masses) or very metal poor ones.

indicating that the star is near the terminal age main sequence. The principal
pulsation mode is an oblique dipole mode that shows a rotationally split
frequency septuplet that provides information on the geometry of the mode. The
secondary mode also appears to be a dipole mode with a rotationally split
triplet, but we are able to show within the improved oblique pulsator model
that these two modes cannot have the same axis of pulsation. This is the first
time for any pulsating star that evidence has been found for separate pulsation
axes for different modes. The two modes are separated in frequency by 55
microHz, which we model as the large separation. The star is an alpha^2 CVn
spotted magnetic variable that shows a complex rotational light variation with
a period of Prot = 5.68459 d. For the first time for any spotted magnetic star
of the upper main sequence, we find clear evidence of light variation with a
period of twice the rotation period; i.e. a subharmonic frequency of $\nu_{\rm

manifestation of torsional modes in an roAp star. From high resolution spectra
we determine Teff = 7400 K, log g = 3.6 and v sin i = 21 km/s. We have found a
magnetic pulsation model with fundamental parameters close to these values that
reproduces the rotational variations of the two obliquely pulsating modes with
different pulsation axes. The star shows overabundances of the rare earth
elements, but these are not as extreme as most other roAp stars. The spectrum

periastron passage, suggesting a connection between tidal interactions and
these periastron effects. The aim of this investigation is to study the
time-dependent response of a star's surface as it is perturbed by a binary
companion. We derive expressions for the rate of dissipation, $\dot{E}$, of the
kinetic energy by the viscous flows driven by tidal interactions on the surface
layer. The method is tested by comparing the results from a grid of model
calculations with the analytical predictions of Hut (1981) and the
synchronization timescales of Zahn (1977, 2008). Our results for the orbital
cycle averaged energy dissipation on orbital separation are consistent with
those of Hut for model binaries with orbital separations at periastron >8
stellar radii. The model also reproduces the predicted pseudo-synchronization
angular velocity for moderate eccentricities and the same scaling of
synchronization timescales for circular orbits with separation as given by
Zahn. The computations gives the distribution of $\dot{E}$ over the stellar
surface, and show that it is generally concentrated at the equatorial latitude,
with maxima generally located around four clearly defined longitudes,
corresponding to the fastest azimuthal velocity perturbations. Maximum
amplitudes occur around periastron passage or slightly thereafter for
supersynchronously rotating stars. In very eccentric binaries, the distribution
of $\dot{E}$ over the surface changes significantly as a function of orbital
phase, with small spatial structures appearing after periastron. An exploratory
calculation for the highly eccentric binary system delta Sco suggests that the
sudden and large amplitude variations in surface properties around periastron
may contribute toward the activity observed around this orbital phase.

the time delay between images are also given to second order in epsilon, again

lensing with displacement.

in this sense, can be considered as a particular case of the method presented

can be understood in a quantum-optics framework in a straightforward and
pedagogical manner. For this purpose we make use of elementary quantum field
theory and Glaubers theory for photon detection in order to calculate the
expected interference pattern in the MMI. If a thermal reference source is used
in the MMI local oscillator port in combination with a thermal source in the
signal port, the interference pattern revealed by such an intensity measurement
shows a distinctive dependence on the differences in the temperature of the two
sources. The MMI can therefore be used in order to perform temperature
measurements. A related method was actually used to carry out high precision
measurements of the cosmic micro-wave background radiation on board of the COBE
satellite. The theoretical framework allows us to consider any initial quantum
state. The interference of single photons as a tool to determine the angular
peak-frequency of a one-photon pulse interfering with a single-photon reference
pulse is, e.g., considered. A similar consideration for coherent laser pulses
leads to a different response in the detector. The MMI experimental setup is
therefore in a sense an example of an optical device where one can exhibit the
difference between classical and quantum-mechanical light using only intensity
measurements.

be explained by a low CO-excitation in the source. Our analysis of the UV-IR
spectral energy distribution of AzTEC 1 shows that it is an extremely young

stars at a rate of ~1300 M_Sol/yr. Our results imply that AzTEC 1 is forming
stars in a 'gravitationally bound' regime in which gravity prohibits the
formation of a superwind, leading to matter accumulation within the galaxy and
further generations of star formation.

through stacking more than 42000 images of Luminous Red Galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. This is the largest dataset ever used for such an analysis
and it allows us to explore the outskirts of massive red galaxies at
unprecedented physical scales. Our image stacks extend farther than 400 kpc,
where the r-band profile surface brightness reaches 30 mag arcsec-2. This
analysis confirms that the stellar bodies of luminous red galaxies follow a
simple Sersic profile out to 100 kpc. At larger radii the profiles deviate from
the best-fit Sersic models and exhibit extra light in the g, r, i and z-band
stacks. This excess light can probably be attributed to unresolved intragroup
or intracluster light or a change in the light profile itself. We further show
that standard analyses of SDSS-depth images typically miss 20% of the total
stellar light and underestimate the size of LRGs by 10% compared to our best
fit r-band Sersic model of n=5.5 and r_e=13.1 kpc. If the excess light at r>100
kpc is considered to be part of the galaxy, the best fit r-band Sersic
parameters are n=5.8 and r_e=13.6 kpc. In addition we study the radially
dependent stack ellipticity and find an increase with radius from e=0.25 at
r=10 kpc to e=0.3 at r=100 kpc. This provides support that the stellar light
that we trace out to at least 100 kpc is physically associated with the
galaxies themselves and may confirm that the halos of individual LRGs have
higher ellipticities than their central parts. Lastly we show that the
broadband color gradients of the stacked images are flat beyond roughly 40 kpc,
suggesting that the stellar populations do not vary significantly with radius
in the outer parts of massive ellipticals.

measurements obtained using Milne-Eddington inversion techniques with and
without stray-light compensation along with measured continuum and line minimum
intensities. We discuss the results in relation to earlier observations and
simulations. We present eight cases involving strong downflows and magnetic
field intensification. All cases studied are associated with the formation of a
bright point in the continuum. In three out of the eight cases we find the
presence of weak opposite polarity field in close proximity to the downflow.
Our data are consistent with earlier simulations describing flux tube collapse,
but the transition to a state with stronger field appears transient and
short-lived, rather than resulting in a permanent field intensification. Three
cases of weak opposite polarity field found adjacent to the downflows do not
appear related to reconnection but may be related to overturning convection
pulling down some field lines and leading to up/down ""serpentine"" field, as
seen in some simulations.

intensity-hardness behavior characteristic of black-hole X-ray transients, we
have analyzed the variability of HLX-1 in the framework of the disk instability
model that explains outbursts of such systems. We find that the long-term
variability of HLX-1 is unlikely to be explained by a model in which outbursts
are triggered by thermal-viscous instabilities in an accretion disc. Possible
alternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure dominated disk but
we argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass-transfer due to
tidal stripping of a star on an eccentric orbit around the intermediate-mass
black hole. We consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation of
such a system and estimate the probability of its observation. We conclude,
using a simplified dynamical model of the post-collapse cluster, that no more
than 1/100 to 1/10 of Mbh < 10^4 Msun IMBHs - formed by run-away stellar
mergers in the dense collapsed cores of young clusters - could have a few times
1 Msun Main-Sequence star evolve to an AGB on an orbit eccentric enough for
mass transfer at periapse, while avoiding collisional destruction or being
scattered into the IMBH by 2-body encounters. The finite but low probability of
this configuration is consistent with the uniqueness of HLX-1. We note,
however, that the actual response of a standard accretion disk to bursts of
mass transfer may be too slow to explain the observations unless the orbit is
close to parabolic (and hence even rarer) and/or additional heating, presumably
linked to the highly time-dependent gravitational potential, are invoked.

have absorption residing to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity. For all
the z~0.1 systems, simple extended disk-like rotation models fail to reproduce
the full MgII velocity spread, implying other dynamical processes contribute to
the MgII kinematics. In fact 55% of the galaxies are ""counter-rotating"" with
respect to the bulk of the MgII absorption. These MgII host-galaxies are

types F0-K5) using the steady-state analytical model of Wyatt et al. (2007).
Models are fitted to published data from the FEPS (Meyer et al. 2006) project
and various GTO programs obtained with MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope at
24 micron and 70 micron, and compared to a previously published analysis of
debris disks around A stars using the same evolutionary model. We find that the
model reproduces most features found in the data sets, noting that the model
disk parameters for solar-type stars are different to those of A stars.
Although this could mean that disks around Solar-type stars have different
properties from their counterparts around earlier-type stars, it is also
possible that the properties of disks around stars of different spectral types
appear more different than they are because the blackbody disk radius
underestimates the true disk radius by a factor $X_r$ which varies with
spectral type. We use results from realistic grain modelling to quantify this
effect for solar-type stars and for A stars. Our results imply that
planetesimals around solar-type stars are on average larger than around A stars
by a factor of a few but that the mass of the disks are lower for disks around
FGK stars, as expected. We also suggest that discrepancies between the
evolutionary timescales of 24 micron statistics predicted by our model and that
observed in previous surveys could be explained by the presence of
two-component disks in the samples of those surveys, or by transient events
being responsible for the 24 micron emission of cold disks beyond a few Myr.
Further study of the prevalence of two component disks, and of constraints on
$X_r$, and increasing the size of the sample of detected disks, are important
for making progress on interpreting the evolution of disks around solar-type

dwarf (WD) must gain a significant amount of matter from a companion star.
Because the accreted mass carries angular momentum, the WD is likely to achieve
fast spin periods, which can increase the critical mass, $M_{crit}$, needed for
explosion. When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,
the WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between
the time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of
the explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore
has a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a
density similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,
either by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,
the donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters,
generally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star.
Nevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive. Prior to
explosion, progenitors can be super-$M_{Ch}$ WDs in either wide binaries with
WD companions, or else in cataclysmic variables. These systems can be
discovered and studied through wide-field surveys. Post explosion, the
spin-up/spin-down model predicts a population of fast-moving WDs, low-mass
stars, and even brown dwarfs. In addition, the spin-up/spin-down model provides
a paradigm which may be able to explain both the similarities and the diversity
observed among SNeIa.

WDs imply vigorous metal accretion at rates up to $10^{11}$ g/s, far in excess
of what can be supplied solely by Poynting-Robertson drag acting on such debris
disks. To explain this observation we propose a model, in which rapid transport
of metals from the disk onto the WD naturally results from interaction between
this particulate disk and spatially coexisting disk of metallic gas. The latter
is fed by evaporation of debris particles at the sublimation radius located at
several tens of WD radii. Because of pressure support gaseous disk orbits WD
slower than particulate disk. Resultant azimuthal drift between them at speed
~1 m/s causes aerodynamic drag on the disk of solids and drives inward
migration of its constituent particles. Upon reaching the sublimation radius
particles evaporate, enhancing the density of metallic gaseous disk and leading
to positive feedback. Under favorable circumstances (low viscosity in the disk
of metallic gas and efficient aerodynamic coupling between the disks) system
evolves in a runaway fashion, destroying debris disk on time scale of $\sim
10^5$ yr, and giving rise to high metal accretion rates up to $10^{10}-10^{11}$

perform the same PCA on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurves
from NASA's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3D spectral Earth model. This
numerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features PCA
can robustly identify. We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar
broadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent
albedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to
mid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes
emphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the
mid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at
short wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor
in the south polar observation. We construct a simple reflectance model for a
snowball Earth. By construction, our model has a higher Bond albedo than the
modern Earth; its surface albedo is so high that Rayleigh scattering does not
noticeably affect its spectrum. The rotational color variations occur at short
wavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land in
those wavebands. Thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal color
variations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-day
Earth, regardless of viewing angle.

moment of the galaxy angular distribution (the so-called clustering dipole). We
study the growth of the clustering dipole of galaxies as a function of the
limiting flux of the sample from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).
Contrary to some earlier claims, we find that the dipole does not converge
before the completeness limit of the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog, i.e. up to
13.5 mag in the near-infrared K_s band (equivalent to an effective distance of
300 Mpc/h). We compare the observed growth of the dipole with the theoretically
expected, conditional one (i.e., given the velocity of the Local Group relative
to the CMB), for the LambdaCDM power spectrum and cosmological parameters
constrained by WMAP. The observed growth turns out to be within 1-sigma
confidence level of its theoretical counterpart once the proper observational
window of the 2MASS flux-limited catalog is included. For a contrast, if the
adopted window is a top-hat, then the predicted dipole grows significantly
faster and converges to its final value for a distance of about 300 Mpc/h. By
comparing the observational windows, we show that for a given flux limit and a
corresponding distance limit, the 2MASS flux-weighted window passes less
large-scale signal than the top-hat one. We conclude that the growth of the
2MASS dipole for effective distances greater than 200 Mpc/h is only apparent.
On the other hand, for a distance of 80 Mpc/h (mean depth of the 2MASS Redshift
Survey) and the LambdaCDM power spectrum, the true dipole is expected to reach
only ~80% of its final value. Eventually, since for the window function of
2MASS the predicted growth is consistent with the observed one, we can compare
the two to evaluate beta = (Omega_m)^0.55 / b. The result is beta = 0.38+-0.04,
which leads to an estimate of the density parameter Omega_m = 0.20+-0.08.

as a function of time. Our analysis confirms previous results finding evidence
for two types of transitional disks -- those with inner holes and those that
are homologously depleted. The percentage of disks in the transitional phase
increases from ~ 15--20% at 1--2 Myr to > 50% at 5--8 Myr; the mean
transitional disk lifetime is closer to ~ 1 Myr than 0.1--0.5 Myr, consistent
with previous studies by Currie et al. (2009) and Sicilia-Aguilar et al.
(2009). In the Coronet Cluster and IC 348, transitional disks are more numerous
for very low-mass M3--M6 stars than for more massive K5--M2 stars, while Taurus
lacks a strong spectral type-dependent frequency. Assuming standard values for
the gas-to-dust ratio and other disk properties, the lower limit for the masses
of optically-thick primordial disks is Mdisk ~ 0.001--0.003 M*. We find that
single color-color diagrams do not by themselves uniquely identify transitional
disks or primordial disks. Full SED modeling is required to accurately assess
disk evolution for individual sources and inform statistical estimates of the
transitional disk population in large samples using mid-IR colors.

quantum systems are studied with respect to their effectiveness at slowing down
the loss of entanglement. The effect of photonic band-gap materials and
frequency modulation of the system-bath coupling are along expected lines in
this regard. However, other control schemes, like resonance fluorescence,
achieve quite the contrary: increasing the strength of the control kills
entanglement off faster. The effect of dynamic decoupling schemes on two
qualitatively different system-bath interactions are studied in depth. Dynamic
decoupling control has the expected effect of slowing down the decay of
entanglement in a two-qubit system coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath under
non-demolition interaction. However, non-trivial phenomena are observed when a
Josephson charge qubit, strongly coupled to a random telegraph noise bath, is
subject to decoupling pulses. The most striking of these reflects the resonance
fluorescence scenario in that an increase in the pulse strength decreases
decoherence but also speeds up the sudden death of entanglement. This
demonstrates that the behaviour of decoherence and entanglement in time can be
qualitatively different in the strong-coupling non-Markovian regime.

conducting walls are known to be unstable if the density contrast between the

and dynamical evolution of isothermal and self-gravitating system embedded in
potential well, which can be the situation of many astrophysical objects such
as the central parts of the galaxies, or clusters of galaxies with potential
dominated by dark matter, but is still limited to the case where the potential
well is fixed during the evolution. As the ratio between the depth of
surrounding potential well and potential of embedded system becomes large, the
potential well becomes effectively the same boundary condition as conducting
wall, which behaves like a thermal heat bath. We also use the direct N-body
simulation code, NBODY6 to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar system
embedded in potential wells and propose the equilibrium models for this system.
In deep potential well, which is analogous to the heat bath with high
temperature, the embedded self-gravitating system is dynamically hot, and
loosely bound or can be unbound since the kinetic energy increases due to the
heating by the potential well. On the other hand, the system undergoes core
collapse by self-gravity when potential well is shallow. Binary heating can
stop the collapse and leads to the expansion, but the evolution is very slow
because the potential as a heat bath can absorb the energy generated by the
binaries. The system can be regarded as quasi-static. Density and velocity
dispersion profiles from the N-body simulations in the final quasi-equilibrium
state are similar to our equilibrium models assumed to be in thermal
equilibrium with the potential well.

dimensional spacetime of the form $M\times \mathcal{N}$, where $M$ is the
4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and $\mathcal{N}$ is an $n$-dimensional
compact manifold. The Casimir force acting on a planar piston that can move
freely inside a closed cylinder with the same cross section is investigated.
Different combinations of perfectly conducting boundary conditions and
infinitely permeable boundary conditions are imposed on the cylinder and the
piston. It is verified that if the piston and the cylinder have the same
boundary conditions, the piston is always going to be pulled towards the closer
end of the cylinder. However, if the piston and the cylinder have different
boundary conditions, the piston is always going to be pushed to the middle of
the cylinder. By taking the limit where one end of the cylinder tends to
infinity, one obtains the Casimir force acting between two parallel plates
inside an infinitely long cylinder. The asymptotic behavior of this Casimir
force in the high temperature regime and the low temperature regime are
investigated for the case where the cross section of the cylinder in $M$ is
large. It is found that if the separation between the plates is much smaller
than the size of $\mathcal{N}$, the leading term of the Casimir force is the
same as the Casimir force on a pair of large parallel plates in the
$(4+n)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. However, if the size of $\mathcal{N}$
is much smaller than the separation between the plates, the leading term of the
Casimir force is $1+h/2$ times the Casimir force on a pair of large parallel
plates in the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, where $h$ is the first Betti
number of $\mathcal{N}$. In the limit the manifold $\mathcal{N}$ vanishes, one
does not obtain the Casimir force in the 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime if
$h$ is nonzero.

performed to access the efficacy and limitations of this estimator. We use this
estimator to evaluate the power spectrum of three individual spiral galaxies, a
dwarf galaxy sample and THINGS * spiral galaxies. In each case, the power
spectrum is found to follow a power law PHI (U) = AU {\alpha} over a specific
length scale range. The estimated value for the slope {\alpha} ranges from ~
~1.5 to ~ -2.6 for the sample of dwarf galaxies. We interpret this bi-modality
as arising due to 2D turbulence on length scales much larger than the
scale-height of the galaxy disk and 3D otherwise. The power law slope also show
a weak correlation with the surface density of star formation rate for these
galaxies. We found for the external spiral galaxies the power spectrum is a
power law up to a length scale of 10 to 16 kpc, indicating turbulence to be
operational at these large length scales. We measure the scale-height of the
external nearly face-on spiral galaxy NGC 1058 to be ~ 500 pc interpreting a
change in the slope observed in it's power spectrum. Power spectrum of the
harassed galaxy NGC 4254 is found to be affected by galaxy harassment. For 18
spiral galaxies derived from the THINGS sample we found no correlation between
the power law slope and the different dynamical parameters of these galaxies.
For most of the dwarf and spiral galaxies, the intensity fluctuation power
spectrum is found to be a direct probe of the density fluctuation and not
affected by the velocity fluctuations in ISM. We would attempt to understand
these new observations in terms of physical models of the ISM in future.

ices differ from those of the PAH and gas. We calculate the column densities of
the ices and derive the abundance ratios of N(CO_2)/N(H_2O) = 0.17 +- 0.05.
They are similar to those obtained around the massive young stellar objects in
our Galaxy (0.17 +- 0.03), although much stronger interstellar radiation field
and higher dust temperature are expected near the center of NGC253.

analysis of complex stochastic models. Earlier, Grelaud et al. (2009) advocated
the use of ABC for Bayesian model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random
fields, relying on a inter-model sufficiency property to show that the
approximation was legitimate. Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a
wide range of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al.,

model choice is ungrounded, since it depends on an unknown amount of
information loss induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The
approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under
comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running
an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of
the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIYABC are
necessary to conduct model choice.

analysis do not represent all studies on the topic of interest, is commonly
recognized as a threat to the validity of the results of a meta analysis. One
way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted
probability distributions. We adopt the nonparametric approach initially
introduced by Dear (1992) but impose that the weight function $w$ is monotonely
non-increasing as a function of the $p$-value. Since in meta analysis one
typically only has few studies or ""observations"", regularization of the
estimation problem seems sensible. In addition, virtually all parametric weight
functions proposed so far in the literature are in fact decreasing. We discuss
how to estimate a decreasing weight function in the above model and illustrate
the new methodology on two well-known examples. The new approach potentially
offers more insight in the selection process than other methods and is more
flexible than parametric approaches. Some basic properties of the
log-likelihood function and computation of a $p$-value quantifying the evidence
against the null hypothesis of a constant weight function are indicated. In
addition, we provide an approximate selection bias adjusted profile likelihood
confidence interval for the treatment effect. The corresponding software and
the datasets used to illustrate it are provided as the R package selectMeta.

aggregates in this size range at velocities below and around the fragmentation
threshold. We developed two independent experimental setups with the same goal
to study the effects of bouncing, fragmentation, and mass transfer in free
particle-particle collisions. The first setup is an evacuated drop tower with a
free-fall height of 1.5 m, providing us with 0.56 s of microgravity time so
that we observed collisions with velocities between 8 mm/s and 2 m/s. The
second setup is designed to study the effect of partial fragmentation (when
only one of the two aggregates is destroyed) and mass transfer in more detail.
It allows for the measurement of the accretion efficiency as the samples are
safely recovered after the encounter. Our results are that for very low
velocities we found bouncing as could be expected while the fragmentation
velocity of 20 cm/s was significantly lower than expected. We present the
critical energy for disruptive collisions Q*, which showed up to be at least
two orders of magnitude lower than previous experiments in the literature. In
the wide range between bouncing and disruptive collisions, only one of the
samples fragmented in the encounter while the other gained mass. The accretion
efficiency in the order of a few percent of the particle's mass is depending on
the impact velocity and the sample porosity. Our results will have consequences
for dust evolution models in protoplanetary disks as well as for the strength

families of ETGs: Slow Rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields
and often include stellar kinematically Distinct Cores (KDCs), and Fast
Rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs
leads to a new criterion to disentangle Fast and Slow Rotators which now
includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (Epsilon). It separates the
two classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than a
criterion based on V/Sigma: Slow Rotators and Fast Rotators have LambdaR lower
and larger than kFSxSQRT(Epsilon), respectively, where kFS=0.31 for
measurements made within 1 Re. We show that the vast majority of early-type
galaxies are Fast Rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with aligned
photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II, Krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discs
and often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in the

ellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic
ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies
consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are Slow
Rotators representing 14% (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all Slow

This research note presents a full analysis of the CAFOS polarimeter
mounted at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope. It also provides future users of this
mode with all necessary information to properly correct for instrumental
effects in polarization data obtained with this instrument.
  Methods. The standard stars BD+59d389 (polarized) and HD14069 (unpolarized)
were observed with CAFOS in November, 2010, using 16 half-wave plate angles.
The linear spectropolarimetric properties of CAFOS were studied using a Fourier
Analysis of the resulting data.
  Results. CAFOS shows a roughly constant instrumental polarization at the
level of ~0.3% between 4000 and 8600 A. Below 4000 A the spurious polarization
grows to reach ~0.7% at 3600 A. This instrumental effect is most likely
produced by the telescope optics, and appears to be additive. The Wollaston
prism presents a clear deviation from the ideal behavior. The problem is
largely removed by the usage of at least 4 retarder plate angles. The
chromatism of the half-wave plate causes a peak-to-peak oscillation of ~11
degrees in the polarization angle. This can be effectively corrected using the
tabulated values presented in this paper. The Fourier analysis shows that the
k!=0,4 harmonics are practically negligible between 3800 and 7400 A.
  Conclusions. After correcting for instrumental polarization and retarder
plate chromatism, with 4 half-wave plate angles CAFOS can reach an rms linear
polarization accuracy of about 0.1%.

possible associated HAlpha emission in the vicinity of about 24 known Galactic
SNRs previously known solely from radio or X-ray observations.The possible
optical counterparts to these known SNR were detected due to the 1 arcsecond
resolution and 5 Rayleigh sensitivity of this HAlpha survey.
  The newly discovered emission frequently exhibits the typical filamentary
form of other optically detected SNRs although sometimes the HAlpha emission
clouds or fragmented filaments largely inside an SNR extend over the radio
border. It is true that superposition of general diffuse and extended Galactic
emission in the region of these remnants is a complicating factor, but for many
optical candidates the HAlpha emission provides an excellent morphological and
positional match to the observed radio emission so that an association seems
clear.
  We have already published HAlpha images and confirmatory spectral
observations for several of the best optical counterparts to known SNRs but for
completeness and convenience we include them in our complete catalogue of
previously known radio detected SNRs for which we have now uncovered HAlpha
optical emission. For better visualisation of the optical emissions from these
faint supernova remnants and to enhance some low surface-brightness features we
also present quotient images of the HAlpha data divided by the accompanying

between March 1940 and February 1972. The light curve is characterized by
strong oscillations of peak to peak amplitude of 2 to more than 3 magnitudes.
Before the gap the fluctuations were modulated mainly by a period Pa=1373 d,
the diurnal cycle of an observer on the surface of the rotating M giant, whose
sun is the hot component. After the gap the dominant periodicity is Pb=1256 d,
which is the binary period of the system. Higher harmonics as well as a few
beats of the two major periodicities can also be identified in the light curve.
We identify one of the beat periods, Pr=656 d, as the sidereal rotation period
of the giant component of the system. The period switching that took place
during the gap in the observations was possibly associated with a certain
cataclysmic event, hints of which may be recognized in the LC in the first 11
years after the gap. We suggest that the origin of the major oscillations is in
periodic episodes of mass accretion from the M giant onto the hot component of
the system. The event of the period switching is possibly related to an
intensive magnetic activity in the outer layers of the giant star. [abridged]

roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic center. It may have originated (i) as the
response of the disc to perturbations excited by satellite companions or (ii)
from the tidal debris of a disrupted dwarf galaxy. The metallicity of Monoceros
stars differs from that of disc stars at comparable Galactocentric distances,
an observation that disfavours the first scenario. On the other hand, circular
orbits are difficult to accommodate in the tidal-disruption scenario, since it
requires a satellite which at the time of disruption was itself in a nearly
circular orbit. Such satellite could not have formed at the location of the
ring and, given its low mass, dynamical friction is unlikely to have played a
major role in its orbital evolution. We search cosmological simulations for
low-mass satellites in nearly-circular orbits and find that they result, almost
invariably, from orbital changes induced by collisions with more massive
satellites: the radius of the circular orbit thus traces the galactocentric
distance of the collision. Interestingly, the Sagittarius dwarf, one of the
most luminous satellites of the Milky Way, is in a polar orbit that crosses the
Galactic plane at roughly the same Galactocentric distance as Monoceros. We use
idealized simulations to demonstrate that an encounter with Sagittarius might
well have led to the circularization and subsequent tidal demise of the
progenitor of the Monoceros ring.

signaling, determinism, and experimental free will, is known to be incompatible
with quantum correlations. Hence, these properties must be individually or
jointly relaxed in any model of such correlations. The necessary degrees of
relaxation are quantified here, via natural distance and information-theoretic
measures. This allows quantitative comparisons between different models in
terms of the resources, such as the number of bits, of randomness,
communication, and/or correlation, that they require. For example, measurement
dependence is a relatively strong resource for modeling singlet state
correlations, with only 1/15 of one bit of correlation required between
measurement settings and the underlying variable. It is shown how various
'relaxed' Bell inequalities may be obtained, which precisely specify the
complementary degrees of relaxation required to model any given violation of a
standard Bell inequality. The robustness of a class of Kochen-Specker theorems,
to relaxation of measurement independence, is also investigated. It is shown
that a theorem of Mermin remains valid unless measurement independence is
relaxed by 1/3. The Conway-Kochen 'free will' theorem and a result of Hardy are
less robust, failing if measurement independence is relaxed by only 6.5% and
4.5%, respectively. An appendix shows the existence of an outcome independent

three-dimensional geometry and use it to study the high-energy emission of the
Vela pulsar. In this model, the outer gap is divided into two parts, i.e. the
main acceleration region on the top of last-open field lines and the screening
region around the upper boundary of the gap. In the main acceleration region,
the charge density is much lower than the Goldreich-Julian charge density and
the charged particles are accelerated by the electric field along the magnetic
field to emit multi-GeV photons. In the screening region, the charge density is
larger than the Goldreich-Julian value to close the gap and particles in this
region are responsible for multi-100MeV photon emission. We apply this three
dimensional two-layer model to the Vela pulsar and compare the model light
curves, the phase-averaged spectrum and the phase-resolved spectra with the
recent Fermi observations, which also reveals the existence of the third peak
between two main peaks. The phase position of the third peak moves with the
photon energy, which cannot be explained by the geometry of magnetic field
structure and the caustic effects of the photon propagation. We suggest that
the existence of the third peak and its energy dependent movement results from
the azimuthal structure of the outer gap.

curvature density via the effect on the geometrical path of photons from large
scale spatial curvature and its effect on the expansion history, H(z).
Cosmological time, however, depends on the expansion history only. Therefore,
by combining distance and lookback time observations (or other estimates of the
expansion history), it is possible to isolate the geometrical curvature
contribution and measure the curvature in a model independent way, i.e., free
from assumptions about the energy content of the universe.
  We investigate two different approaches to accomplish this task; the
differential and the integral approach. The differential approach requires, in
addition to distances, derivatives of distance with respect to redshift as well
as knowledge of the expansion history. The integral approach is based on
measuring the integral of the inverse of the expansion history via measurements
of cosmic time as derived, e.g., from galaxy ages.
  In this paper, we attempt to constrain the large scale curvature of the
Universe using distances obtained from observations of Type Ia supernovae
together with inferred ages of passively evolving galaxies and Hubble parameter
estimates from the large scale clustering of galaxies. Current data are
consistent with zero spatial curvature, although the uncertainty on the
curvature density is of order unity. Future data sets with on the order of
thousands of Type Ia supernovae distances and galaxy ages will allow us to
constrain the curvature density with an uncertainty of less than 0.1 at the 95%
confidence level.

states from a domain of unbound ones (continuum). For all above-mentioned
systems critical charges $Z_c$ as well as equilibrium geometrical
configurations are found. For all studied systems there was obtained an
indication to a square-root singularity at $Z=Z_{cr}$.

quantum dynamical semigroups, we give a description of the continuous-variable
entanglement for a system consisting of two noninteracting modes embedded in a
thermal environment. By using the Peres-Simon necessary and sufficient
criterion for separability of two-mode Gaussian states, we describe the
evolution of entanglement in terms of the covariance matrix for Gaussian input
states. For all values of the temperature of the thermal reservoir, an initial
separable Gaussian state remains separable for all times. In the case of an
entangled initial Gaussian state, entanglement suppression (entanglement sudden
death) takes place, for non-zero temperatures of the environment. Only for a
zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial entangled state remains
entangled for finite times. We also show that, independent of its type -
separable or entangled, the initial state evolves asymptotically to an
equilibrium state which is always separable.

support Dirac fermions with a single-valley band dispersion. In the presence of
disorder they experience weak antilocalization, which has been observed in
recent transport experiments. In this work we conduct a comparative theoretical
study of the weak antilocalization in HgTe quantum wells and topological
surface states. The difference between these two single-valley systems comes
from a finite band gap (effective Dirac mass) in HgTe quantum wells in contrast
to gapless (massless) surface states in topological insulators. The finite
effective Dirac mass implies a broken internal symmetry, leading to suppression
of the weak antilocalization in HgTe quantum wells at times larger than certain
t_M, inversely proportional to the Dirac mass. This corresponds to the opening
of a relaxation gap 1/t_M in the Cooperon diffusion mode which we obtain from
the Bethe-Salpeter equation including relevant spin degrees of freedom. We
demonstrate that the relaxation gap exhibits an interesting nonmonotonic
dependence on both carrier density and band gap, vanishing at a certain
combination of these parameters. The weak-antilocalization conductivity
reflects this nonmonotonic behavior which is unique to HgTe QWs and absent for
topological surface states. On the other hand, the topological surface states
exhibit specific weak-antilocalization magnetoconductivity in a parallel
magnetic field due to their exponential decay in the bulk.

electrokinetic equations. We discuss different relevant effects due to the
membrane conductivity or due to the bulk diffusion coefficients of the ions. Of
particular interest is the case where the membrane has selective conductivity
for only one type of ion. These results, and future extensions thereof, should
be useful for the interpretation of impedance spectroscopy data used to
characterize e.g. ion channels embedded in planar bilayers.

between his more prolonged studies of stellar structure and radiative transfer.
This paper traces the history of one of his ideas -- namely, that the shape of
the galactic potential controls the orientation of the stellar velocity
dispersion tensor. It has its roots in papers by Eddington (1915) and
Chandrasekhar (1939), and provoked a fascinating dispute between these two
great scientists -- less well-known than their famous controversy over the
white dwarf stars. In modern language, Eddington claimed that the integral
curves of the eigenvectors of the velocity dispersion tensor provide a
one-dimensional foliation into mutually orthogonal surfaces. Chandrasekhar
challenged this, and explicitly constructed a counter-example. In fact, the
work of neither of these great scientists was without flaws, though further
developments in stellar dynamics were to ultimately draw more on Eddington's
insight than Chandrasekhar's. We conclude with a description of modern attempts
to measure the orientation of the velocity dispersion tensor for populations in
the Milky Way Galaxy, a subject that is coming into its own with the dawning of
the Age of Precision Astrometry.

opportune quantiles of the stationary measure could be held responsible for
this phenomenon. In the case of birth- and-death chains this mechanism is
fairly well understood; our work is an effort to generalize this picture to
more general systems, such as systems having stationary measure spread over the
whole state space or systems in which the study of the cutoff may not be
reduced to a one-dimensional problem. In those situations the drift may be
looked for by means of a suitable partitioning of the state space into classes;
using a statistical mechanics language it is then possible to set up a kind of
energy-entropy competition between the weight and the size of the classes.
Under the lens of this partitioning one can focus the mentioned drift and prove
cutoff with relative ease.

dust particles if they are illuminated. We find that even more intense dust
eruptions occur when the light source is turned off. We attribute this to a
compression of gas by thermal creep in response to the changing temperature
gradients in the top dust layers. The effect is studied at a light flux of 13
kW/(m*m) and 1 mbar ambient pressure. The effect is applicable to
protoplanetary disks and Mars. In the inner part of protoplanetary disks,
planetesimals can be eroded especially at the terminator of a rotating body.
This leads to the production of dust which can then be transported towards the
disk edges or the outer disk regions. The generated dust might constitute a
significant fraction of the warm dust observed in extrasolar protoplanetary
disks. We estimate erosion rates of about 1 kg/s for 100 m parent bodies. The
dust might also contribute to subsequent planetary growth in different
locations or on existing protoplanets which are large enough not to be
susceptible to particle loss by light induced ejection. Due to the ejections,
planetesimals and smaller bodies will be accelerated or decelerated and drift
outward or inward, respectively. The effect might also explain the entrainment
of dust in dust devils on Mars, especially at high altitudes where gas drag
alone might not be sufficient.

characterization of microstructured polymer fibers featuring a

without distorting their modal profile. Additionally, the air-tight porous
cladding serves as a natural enclosure for the fiber core, thus avoiding the
need for a bulky external enclosure for humidity-purged atmosphere. Fibers of 5
mm and 3 mm in outer diameters with a 150 \mu m suspended solid core and a 900
\mu m suspended porous core respectively, were obtained by utilizing a
combination of drilling and stacking techniques. Characterization of the fiber
optical properties and the near-field imaging of the guided modes were
performed using a terahertz near-field microscopy setup. Near-field imaging of
the modal profiles at the fiber output confirmed the effectively single-mode
behavior of such waveguides. The suspended core fibers exhibit broadband
transmission from 0.10 THz to 0.27 THz (larger core), and from 0.25 THz to 0.51
THz (smaller core). Due to the large fraction of power that is guided in the
holey cladding, fiber propagation losses as low as 0.02 cm-1 are demonstrated.
Low-loss guidance combined with the core isolated from environmental
perturbations make these all-dielectric fibers suitable for practical terahertz
imaging and sensing applications.

logical structures as \emph{concrete logics} associated with physical theories

for a given theory $\mathcal T$ and classical language $\mathcal L$ expressing
$\mathcal T$, an observative sublanguage $L$ of $\mathcal L$ with a notion of
truth as correspondence, introducing in $L$ a derived and theory-dependent
notion of \emph{C-truth} (\emph{true with certainty}), defining a
\emph{physical preorder} induced by C-truth, and finally selecting a set of
sentences that are \emph{verifiable} (or \emph{testable}) according to
$\mathcal T$, on which a \emph{weak complementation} is induced by $\mathcal
T$. The triple consisting of the set of verifiable sentences, physical order
and weak complementation is then the desired concrete logic. By applying our
procedure we recover a classical logic as the concrete logic associated with
classical mechanics and standard quantum logic as the concrete logic associated
with quantum mechanics. We also show that our alternative view of standard
quantum logic, which can be constructed in a purely formal way, can be provided
with a physical meaning by adopting a recent interpretation of quantum
mechanics that reinterprets quantum probabilities as conditional on detection
rather than absolute. Our results then show that some nonstandard logics can be
obtained as mathematical structures formalizing the properties of different
notions of verifiability in different physical theories. More generally, they
strongly support the idea that many nonclassical logics can coexist without
conflicting with classical logic (\emph{global pluralism}), for they formalize
metalinguistic notions that do not coincide with the notion of truth (described
by Tarski's truth theory).

special character of renormalizability in \phi^4 theory: to obtain the

the bare theory. In fact, such kind of renormalizability is not accidental and
can be understood in the framework of Wilson's many-parameter renormalization
group. Application of these ideas to QCD shows that Wilson's theory of
confinement is not purely illustrative, but has a direct relation to a real

At low temperature the VdW attraction is the main competitor to the Casimir
force. As the temperature is raised, the VdW force decreases by virtue of the
polsrizability falling down gradually. This trend is advanced in multilevel
systems. such as the off-center defects, where the polarizability is
renormalized through electron-vibrational mode coupling to gain a multiple
vibronic enhancement by many orders of magnitude. Applications to high-Tc
superconductivity and cosmology are conceivable.

processes are coupled at the gene and species level. With this motivation, we
compare the topological properties (mainly the depth scaling, as a
characterization of balance) of a large set of protein phylogenies with a set
of species phylogenies. The comparative analysis shows that both sets of
phylogenies share remarkably similar scaling behavior, suggesting the
universality of branching rules and of the evolutionary processes that drive
biological diversification from gene to species level. In order to explain such
generality, we propose a simple model which allows us to estimate the
proportion of evolvability/robustness needed to approximate the scaling
behavior observed in the phylogenies, highlighting the relevance of the
robustness of a biological system (species or protein) in the scaling
properties of the phylogenetic trees. Thus, the rules that govern the
incapability of a biological system to diversify are equally relevant both at
the gene and at the species level.

topological phase characterized by a Kramers pair of Majorana edge modes
(helical Majorana modes). Existing detection schemes to identify this phase
rely either on spin transport properties, which are quite difficult to measure,
or on local charge transport, which allows only a partial identification. Here
we show that the presence of helical Majorana modes can be unambiguously
revealed by measuring the nonlocal charge conductance. Focusing on a
superconducting ring, we suggest two experiments that provide unique and robust
signatures to detect the helical superconductor phase.

two experimental methods commonly used in its determination. The analysis is
aimed at clarifying the view that the one-way speed of light cannot be
determined by techniques in which physical entities close paths. The procedure
employed here will provide epistemological tools such that physicists
understand that a direct measurement of the speed not only of light but of any
physical entity is by no means trivial. Our results shed light on the physics
behind the experiments which may be of interest for both physicists with an
elemental knowledge in special relativity and philosophers of science.
