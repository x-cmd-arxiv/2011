  Institutional eLibrary","6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.DL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Devising a scheme for evaluating the service quality of an institutional
electronic library is a difficult and challenging task. The challenge comes
from the fact that the services provided by an institutional electronic library
depend upon the contents requested by the users and the contents housed by the
library. Different types of users might be interested in different types of
contents. In this paper, we propose a technique for evaluating the service
quality of an institutional electronic library. Our scheme is based on the
service profiles of contents requested by the users at the server side which is
hosted at the library. Further, we propose models to analyze the service
quality of an electronic library. For analyzing the service quality, we present
two analytical models. The first one is based on the number of days by which
the item to be served by the library is delayed and the penalty points per day
for the duration for which the item is delayed. The second model is based on
the credits earned by the library if the item is served in a timely fashion,
and the penalties, thereof, if the item is delayed. These models may help in
evaluating the service quality of an electronic library and taking the
corrective measures to improve it.

a spatial inhomogeneity in the form of the so-called chiral density waves (CDW)

values of $\mu$, i.e. at $\mu<\mu_c\approx 0.68M_0$ ($M_0$ is the dynamical
quark mass in the vacuum) only the homogeneous charged pion condensation phase
is realized for arbitrary nonzero values of $\mu_I$. Contrary to this, for
large values of $\mu>\mu_c$, two CDW phases appear in the $(\mu_I,\mu)$-phase
diagram of the model. In the first phase, CDWs are clockwise twisted chiral
spirals and in the second phase they are counterclockwise. The influence of
nonzero temperature on the formation of the CDW phases is also investigated.

protocols that use the feedback bits for retransmission request only. In
particular, for the case of a single retransmission and a single feedback bit,
it is shown that the repetition is not needed at low $\snr$ where the
throughput improvement is due to power control only. On the other hand, at high

of power control and ability of make up for deep fades.

  We prove that $I^{(x)}$ and $L^{(x)}$ are conjugated in the group

that $\eta$ transforms $I^{(x)}$ in $L^{(-x)}$ by conjugation. These facts are
proved as corollaries of much more general results.
  Then we carefully analyze the action of these operators on the set $\mc{R}$
of second order linear recurrent sequences. While $I^{(x)}$ and $L^{(x)}$
transform $\mc{R}$ in itself, $\eta$ sends $\mc{R}$ in the set of moment
sequences $\mu_n(h,k)$ of particular families of orthogonal polynomials, whose
weight functions are explicitly computed.
  The moments come out to be generalized Motzkin numbers (if $R=\zz$, the
Motzkin numbers are $\mu_n(-1,1)$). We give several interesting expressions of
$\mu_n(h,k)$ in closed forms, and one recurrence relation.
  There is a fundamental sequence of moments, that generates all the other
ones, $\mu_n(0,k)$. These moments are strongly related with Catalan numbers.
This fact allows us to find, in the final part, a new identity on Catalan
numbers by using orthogonality relations.

radiation pressure generated - due to the fact that the massive accretion disk
yields a strong anisotropy in the radiation field, releasing most of the
radiation pressure perpendicular to the disk accretion flow. Here, we analyze
the self-gravity of the forming circumstellar disk as the potential major
driver of the angular momentum transport in such massive disks responsible for
the high accretion rates needed for the formation of massive stars. For this
purpose, we perform self-gravity radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the
collapse of massive pre-stellar cores. The formation and evolution of the
resulting circumstellar disk is investigated in 1.) axially symmetric
simulations using an alpha-shear-viscosity prescription and 2.) a
three-dimensional simulation, in which the angular momentum transport is
provided self-consistently by developing gravitational torques in the
self-gravitating accretion disk. The simulation series of different strength of
the alpha-viscosity shows that the accretion history of the forming star is
mostly independent of the alpha-viscosity-parameter. The accretion history of
the three-dimensional run driven by self-gravity is more time-dependent than
the viscous disk evolution in axial symmetry. The mean accretion rate, i.e. the
stellar mass growth, is nearly identical to the alpha-viscosity models. We
conclude that the development of gravitational torques in self-gravitating
disks around forming massive stars provides a self-consistent mechanism to
efficiently transport the angular momentum to outer disk radii. Also the
formation of the most massive stars can therefore be understood in the standard
accretion disk scenario.

random binary sparse generating matrices. The results on the existence of
capacity achieving linear codes in the literature are limited to the random
binary codes with equal probability generating matrix elements and sparse
parity-check matrices. Moreover, the codes with sparse generating matrices
reported in the literature are not proved to be capacity achieving.
  As opposed to the existing results in the literature, which are based on
optimal maximum a posteriori decoders, the proposed approach is based on a
different decoder and consequently is suboptimal. We also demonstrate an
interesting trade-off between the sparsity of the generating matrix and the
error exponent (a constant which determines how exponentially fast the
probability of error decays as block length tends to infinity). An interesting
observation is that for small block sizes, less sparse generating matrices have
better performances while for large blok sizes, the performance of the random
generating matrices become independent of the sparsity. Moreover, we prove the
existence of capacity achieving linear codes with a given (arbitrarily low)
density of ones on rows of the generating matrix. In addition to proving the
existence of capacity achieving sparse codes, an important conclusion of our
paper is that for a sufficiently large code length, no search is necessary in
practice to find a deterministic matrix by proving that any arbitrarily
selected sequence of sparse generating matrices is capacity achieving with high
probability. The focus in this paper is on the binary symmetric and binary
erasure channels.her discrete memory-less symmetric channels.

diffusion mechanism is proposed for the system under consideration. According
to this mechanism, rotational transition of the flake from commensurate to
incommensurate states takes place with subsequent simultaneous rotation and
translational motion until the commensurate state is reached again, and so on.
The molecular dynamics simulations and analytic estimates based on ab initio
and semi-empirical calculations demonstrate that the proposed diffusion
mechanism is dominant at temperatures T ~ Tcom, where Tcom corresponds to the
barrier for transitions of the flake between adjacent energy minima in the
commensurate states. For example, for the flake consisting of ~ 40, 200 and 700
atoms the contribution of the proposed diffusion mechanism through rotation of
the flake to the incommensurate states exceeds that for diffusion of the flake
in the commensurate states by one-two orders of magnitude at temperatures 50 -
150 K, 200 - 600 K and 800 - 2400 K, respectively. The possibility to
experimentally measure the barriers to relative motion of graphene layers based
on the study of diffusion of a graphene flake is considered. The results
obtained are also relevant for understanding of dynamic behavior of polycyclic
aromatic molecules on graphene and should be qualitatively valid for a set of
commensurate adsorbate-adsorbent systems.

disproportionate frequency in some classes versus others, and have been studied
under names such as emerging patterns and contrast sets. Such patterns have
demonstrated considerable value for classification and subgroup discovery, but
a detailed understanding of the types of interactions among items in a
discriminative pattern is lacking. To address this issue, we propose to
categorize discriminative patterns according to four types of item interaction:
(i) driver-passenger, (ii) coherent, (iii) independent additive and (iv)
synergistic beyond independent additive. Either of the last three is of
practical importance, with the latter two representing a gain in the
discriminative power of a pattern over its subsets. Synergistic patterns are
most restrictive, but perhaps the most interesting since they capture a
cooperative effect. For domains such as genetic research, differentiating among
these types of patterns is critical since each yields very different biological
interpretations. For general domains, the characterization provides a novel
view of the nature of the discriminative patterns in a dataset, which yields
insights beyond those provided by current approaches that focus mostly on
pattern-based classification and subgroup discovery. This paper presents a
comprehensive discussion that defines these four pattern types and investigates
their properties and their relationship to one another. In addition, these
ideas are explored for a variety of datasets (ten UCI datasets, one gene
expression dataset and two genetic-variation datasets). The results demonstrate
the existence, characteristics and statistical significance of the different
types of patterns. They also illustrate how pattern characterization can
provide novel insights into discriminative pattern mining and the
discriminative structure of different datasets.

(JHEP08(2010)115) based on the non abelian discrete flavor group A4,
implemented in a custodial RS setup with a bulk Higgs. We showed that the
standard model flavor structure can be realized within the zero mode
approximation (ZMA), with nearly tribimaximal (TBM) neutrino mixing and a
realistic CKM matrix with rather mild assumptions. An important advantage of
this framework with respect to flavor anarchic models is the vanishing of the
dangerous tree level KK gluon contribution to \epsilon_K and the suppression of
the new physics one loop contributions to the neutron EDM, \epsilon'/\epsilon,
b->s\gamma and Higgs mediated flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes.
These results are obtained beyond the ZMA, in order to account for the the full
flavor structure and mixing of the zero modes and first Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes
of all generations. The resulting constraints on the KK mass scale are shown to
be significantly relaxed compared to the flavor anarchic case, showing
explicitly the role of non abelian discrete flavor symmetries in relaxing
flavor violation bounds within the RS setup. As a byproduct of our analysis we
also obtain the same contributions for the custodial anarchic case with two
SU(2)_R doublets for each fermion generation.

Initial processing of a small fraction of the survey has produced 11
discoveries, all of which are sparsely-emitting neutron stars, as well as
provided confirmation of two previously unconfirmed neutron stars. Most of the
newly discovered objects lie in regions surveyed previously, indicating both
the improved sensitivity of the HTRU survey observing system and the dynamic
nature of the radio sky. The cycles of active and null states in nulling
pulsars, rotating radio transients (RRATs), and long-term intermittent pulsars
are explored in the context of determining the relationship between these
populations, and of the sensitivity of a search to the various
radio-intermittent neutron star populations. This analysis supports the case
that many RRATs are in fact high-null-fraction pulsars (i. e. with null
fraction >~0.95), and indicates that intermittent pulsars appear distinct from
nulling pulsars in their activity cycle timescales. We find that in the
measured population, there is a deficit of pulsars with typical emission
timescales greater than ~300 s that is not readily explained by selection
effects. The HTRU low-latitude survey will be capable of addressing whether
this deficit is physical. We predict that the HTRU survey will explore pulsars
with a broad range of nulling fractions (up to and beyond 0.999), and at its
completion is likely to increase the currently known RRATs by a factor of more

usually not easy for the user to state formally which system she prefers. Prior
work proposed to rank the correct systems by adding a quantitative aspect to

objective of the system is to minimize the expected (ratio) costs. The solution
is based on a reduction to Markov Decision Processes with ratio cost functions

However, new ideas have recently renewed the interest in LTL synthesis: One
major new contribution in this area is the recent work of Piterman et al. who
showed how polynomial time synthesis can be achieved for a large class of LTL
specifications that is expressive enough to cover many practical examples.
These LTL specifications are equivalent to omega-automata having a so-called
GR(1) acceptance condition. This approach has been used to automatically
synthesize implementations of real-world applications. To this end, manually
written deterministic omega-automata having GR(1) conditions were used instead
of the original LTL specifications. However, manually generating deterministic
monitors is, of course, a hard and error-prone task. In this paper, we
therefore present algorithms to automatically translate specifications of a

drive the CME in a similar manner as in simulations of space weather events on

forming of a comet-like planetary magnetotail which is oriented almost
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the CME. The combination of
this feature and the fact that the CME does not expand much by the time it
reaches the planet leads to a unique CME-magnetosphere interaction, where the
CME itself is highly affected by the presence of the planetary magnetosphere.
We find that the planet is well-shielded from CME penetration, even for a
relatively weak internal magnetic field. The planetary angular momentum loss
associated with such an event is negligible compared to the total planetary
angular momentum. We also find that the energy which is deposited in the

Laplacians, from the point of view of algebraic geometry. We describe the

of states. Finally, we also compute some spectral functions based on the

  We discuss the difference between the cases with rational or irrational
parameters: for the two dimensional Harper operator, the compactification of
the Bloch variety is an ordinary variety in the rational case and an
ind-pro-variety in the irrational case. This gives rise, at the
algebro-geometric level of Bloch varieties, to a phenomenon similar to the
Hofstadter butterfly in the spectral theory. In dimension two, the density of
states can be expressed in terms of period integrals over Fermi curves, where
the resulting elliptic integrals are independent of the parameters.
  In dimension one, for the almost Mathieu operator, with a similar argument we
find the usual dependence of the spectral density on the parameter, which gives
rise to the well known Hofstadter butterfly picture.

vacuum arc centrifuge, a cylindrical, rapidly rotating, low temperature and

generated linear magnetised plasma (WOMBAT), with similar density and field
strength. Compared to typical centrifuge plasmas, WOMBAT plasmas have slower
normalised rotation frequency, lower temperature and lower axial velocity.
Despite these differences, the two-fluid model provides a consistent
description of the WOMBAT plasma configuration and yields qualitative agreement
between measured and predicted wave oscillation frequencies with axial field
strength. In addition, the radial profile of the density perturbation predicted
by this model is consistent with the data. Parameter scans show that the
dispersion curve is sensitive to the axial field strength and the electron
temperature, and the dependence of oscillation frequency with electron
temperature matches the experiment. These results consolidate earlier claims
that the density and floating potential oscillations are a resistive drift
mode, driven by the density gradient. To our knowledge, this is the first
detailed physics model of flowing plasmas in the diffusion region away from the

non-uniformity and magnetic field oscillations, are also discussed.

CrA, and V854 Cen with the mid-IR interferometer, MIDI on the VLTI, using two
telescope pairs. The baselines ranged from 30 to 60 m, allowing us to probe the
dusty environment at very small spatial scales (~ 50 mas or 400 stellar radii).
The observations of the RCB star dust environments were interpreted using both
geometrical models and one-dimensional radiative transfer codes. From our
analysis we find that asymmetric circumstellar material is apparent in RY Sgr,
may also exist in V CrA, and is possible for V854 Cen. Overall, we find that
our observations are consistent with dust forming in clumps ejected randomly
around the RCB star so that over time they create a spherically symmetric
distribution of dust. However, we conclude that the determination of whether
there is a preferred plane of dust ejection must wait until a time series of
observations are obtained.

it does not need a form. We demonstrate this method for the finite-size scaling
analysis of the Ising models on square and triangular lattices. Near the
critical point, the method is comparable in accuracy to the least-square
method. In addition, it works well for data to which we cannot apply the
least-square method with a polynomial of low degree. By comparing the data on
triangular lattices with the scaling function inferred from the data on square
lattices, we confirm the universality of the finite-size scaling function of
the two-dimensional Ising model.

validate our ideas theoretically and with simulation studies, but we also

compact homogeneous spaces and their homogeneous fibrations. We consider the
homogeneous spaces with positive Euler characteristic. It is well known that
such spaces carry many stable complex structures equivariant under the
canonical action of the maximal torus $T^k$. As the torus action in this case
has only isolated fixed points it is possible to effectively apply localization
formula for the universal toric genus. Using this we prove that the famous
topological results related to rigidity and multiplicativity of a Hirzebruch
genus can be obtained on homogeneous spaces just using representation theory.
In that context for homogeneous $SU$-spaces we prove the well known result
about rigidity of the Krichever genus. We also prove that for a large class of
stable complex homogeneous spaces any $T^k$-equivariant Hirzebruch genus given
by an odd power series vanishes. Related to the problem of multiplicativity we
provide construction of stable complex $T^k$-fibrations for which the universal
toric genus is twistedly multiplicative. We prove that it is always twistedly
multiplicative for almost complex homogeneous fibrations and describe those
fibrations for which it is multiplicative. As a consequence for such fibrations
the strong relations between rigidity and multiplicativity for an equivariant
Hirzebruch genus is established. The universal toric genus of the fibrations
for which the base does not admit any stable complex structure is also
considered. The main examples here for which we compute the universal toric
genus are the homogeneous fibrations over quaternionic projective spaces.

spectrum sharing. Cooperative spectrum sharing is one effective way to achieve
this goal. In cooperative spectrum sharing, secondary users (SUs) relay
traffics for primary users (PUs), in exchange for dedicated transmission time
for the SUs' own communication needs. In this paper, we study the cooperative
spectrum sharing under incomplete information, where SUs' types (capturing
their heterogeneity in relay channel gains and evaluations of power
consumptions) are private information and not known by PUs. Inspired by the
contract theory, we model the network as a labor market. The single PU is the
employer who offers a contract to the SUs. The contract consists of a set of
contract items representing combinations of spectrum accessing time (i.e.,
reward) and relaying power (i.e., contribution). The SUs are employees, and
each of them selects the best contract item to maximize his payoff. We study
the optimal contract design for both weak and strong incomplete information
scenarios. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for feasible
contracts in both scenarios. In the weak incomplete information scenario, we
further derive the optimal contract that achieves the same maximum PU's utility
as in the complete information benchmark. In the strong incomplete information
scenario, we propose a Decompose-and-Compare algorithm that achieves a
close-to-optimal contract. We future show that the PU's average utility loss
due to the suboptimal algorithm and the strong incomplete information are both
relatively small (less than 2% and 1:3%, respectively, in our numerical results
with two SU types).

dynamism. Diversity results in users having different preferences for the
quality requirements of a system. Diversity also makes possible alternative
implementations for functional requirements, called variants, each of them
providing different quality. The quality provided by the system may vary due to
different variant components and changes in the environment. The challenge is
to dynamically adapt to quality variations and to find the variant that best
fulfills the multi-criteria quality requirements driven by user preferences and
current runtime conditions. For service-oriented systems this challenge is
augmented by their distributed nature and lack of control over the constituent
services and their provided quality of service (QoS). We propose a novel
approach to runtime adaptability that detects QoS changes, updates the system
model with runtime information, and uses the model to select the variant to
execute at runtime. We introduce negotiable maintenance goals to express user
quality preferences in the requirements model and automatically interpret them
quantitatively for system execution. Our lightweight selection strategy selects
the variant that best fulfills the user required multi-criteria QoS based on
updated QoS values.

obtained by minimizing systematic variations in galaxy luminosities with
respect to a reference luminosity function measured from the whole survey. This
method offers two advantages over more popular bulk flow estimators: it is
independent of error-prone distance indicators and of the poorly-known galaxy
bias. We apply the method to the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) to measure the
local bulk flows of spherical shells centered on the Milky Way (MW). The result
is consistent with that obtained by Nusser and Davis (2011) using the SFI++

produce the whole zoo of galaxies we observe is largely unknown. Indeed there
is still much to understand about the detailed physics of each process in
isolation. While these formation channels have been studied using
hydrodynamical simulations, here we study their impact on gas properties and
star formation (SF) with some of the first simulations that capture the
multiphase, cloudy nature of the interstellar medium (ISM), by virtue of their
high spatial resolution (and corresponding low temperature threshold). In this
regime, we examine the competition between cold flows and a
supernovae(SNe)-driven outflow in a very high-redshift galaxy (z {\approx} 9)
and study the evolution of equal-mass galaxy mergers at low and high redshift,
focusing on the induced SF. We find that SNe-driven outflows cannot reduce the
cold accretion at z {\approx} 9 and that SF is actually enhanced due to the
ensuing metal enrichment. We demonstrate how several recent observational
results on galaxy populations (e.g. enhanced HCN/CO ratios in ULIRGs, a
separate Kennicutt Schmidt (KS) sequence for starbursts and the population of
compact early type galaxies (ETGs) at high redshift) can be explained with
mechanisms captured in galaxy merger simulations, provided that the multiphase

they are relatively simple and unevolved. We present new models for the
chemical evolution of these galaxies by assuming different regimes of star
formation (bursting and continuous) and different kinds of galactic winds
(normal and metal-enhanced). Our results show that in order to reproduce all
the properties of these galaxies, including the spread in the chemical
abundances, the star formation should have proceeded in bursts and the number
of bursts should be not larger than 10 in each galaxy, and that metal-enhanced
galactic winds are required. A metal-enhanced wind efficiency increasing with
galactic mass can by itself reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation
although also an increasing efficiency of star formation and/or number and/or
duration of bursts can equally well reproduce such a relation. Metal enhanced
winds together with an increasing amount of star formation with galactic mass
are required to explain most of the properties of these galaxies. Normal
galactic winds, where all the gas is lost at the same rate, do not reproduce
the features of these galaxies. We suggest that these galaxies should have
suffered a different number of bursts varying from 2 to 10 and that the
efficiency of metal-enhanced winds should have been not too high
($\lambda_{mw}\sim1$). We predict for these galaxies present time Type Ia SN
rates from 0.00084 and 0.0023 per century. Finally, by comparing the abundance
patterns of Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ objects with our models we conclude that they

Nevertheless the chemical composition of their atmospheres exhibits common
indications of being produced by the accretion, plus ulterior in-situ
processing of cometary materials. This is remarkable because while the Earth
formed in the inner part of the disk, presumably from the accretion of rocky
planetesimals depleted in oxygen and exhibiting a chemical similitude with
enstatite chondrites, Titan formed within Saturn's sub-nebula from oxygen- and
volatile-rich bodies, called cometesimals. From a cosmochemical and
astrobiological perspective the study of the H, C, N, and O isotopes on Earth
and Titan could be the key to decipher the processes occurred in the early
stages of formation of both planetary bodies. The main goal of this paper is to
quantify the presumable ways of chemical evolution of both planetary bodies, in
particular the abundance of CO and N2 in their early atmospheres. In order to
do that the primeval atmospheres and evolution of Titan and Earth have been
analyzed from a thermodynamic point of view. The most relevant chemical
reactions involving these species and presumably important at their early
stages are discussed. Then we have interpreted the results of this study in
light of the results obtained by the Cassini-Huygens mission on these species
and their isotopes. Given that H, C, N and O were preferentially depleted from
inner disk materials that formed our planet, the observed similitude of their
isotopic fractionation, and subsequent close evolution of Earth's and Titan's
atmospheres points towards a cometary origin of Earth atmosphere. Consequently,
our scenario also supports the key role of late veneers (comets and water-rich
carbonaceous asteroids) enriching the volatile content of the Earth at the time
of the Late Heavy Bombardment of terrestrial planets.

similar properties and the findings for low mass X-ray binaries are also valid
for high mass binaries, we analyzed the time series of high mass X-ray binary
sources produced by All Sky Monitor of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer.
  Method: We obtained the power density spectra of the high mass X-ray binaries
using the cosine transform of autocorrelation function.
  Results: We identified break frequencies for seven sources, namely OAO
1657-415, SS 433, Vela X-1, SMC X-1, 4U 1700-377, GX 301-2, and LMC X-1. The
normalized break frequencies with respect to the orbital frequency
($f_{break}/f_{orbit}$) for sources OAO 1657-415, SS 433, SMC X-1 and LMC X-1
are consistent with those of Roche lobe overflow systems. The other high mass
X-ray binary systems, Vela X-1, GX 301-2, and 4U 1700-377, however, have larger
break frequency ratios, $f_{break}/f_{orb} $, which are indicative of short
viscous times. These are all wind-accreting sources and the stellar winds in
the systems allow the formation of only short radius discs.
  Consequently, we qualitatively distinguished the Roche lobe overflow binaries
from the wind accreting system by comparing their normalized break frequencies.

and transfers a large number of molecules per cycle (of the order of 10^23). By
contrast, a nano-scale charge pump can be thought as the ultimate
miniaturization of a pump, with its operation being subject to quantum
mechanics and with only few electrons or even fractions of electrons transfered
per cycle. It generates a direct current in the absence of an applied voltage
exploiting the time-dependence of some properties of a nano-scale conductor.
The idea of pumping in nanostructures was discussed theoretically a few decades
ago [1-4]. So far, nano-scale pumps have been realised only in system
exhibiting strong Coulombic effects [5-12], whereas evidence for pumping in the
absence of Coulomb-blockade has been elusive. A pioneering experiment by
Switkes et al. [13] evidenced the difficulty of modulating in time the
properties of an open mesoscopic conductor at cryogenic temperatures without
generating undesired bias voltages due to stray capacitances [14,15]. One
possible solution to this problem is to use the ac Josephson effect to induce
periodically time-dependent Andreev-reflection amplitudes in a hybrid
normal-superconducting system [16]. Here we report the experimental detection
of charge flow in an unbiased InAs nanowire (NW) embedded in a superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID). In this system, pumping may occur via the
cyclic modulation of the phase of the order parameter of different
superconducting electrodes. The symmetry of the current with respect to the
enclosed magnetic flux [17,18] and bias SQUID current is a discriminating
signature of pumping. Currents exceeding 20 pA are measured at 250 mK, and
exhibit symmetries compatible with a pumping mechanism in this setup which
realizes a Josephson quantum electron pump (JQEP).

Predictions and interpolations at unobserved times and/or locations help to
solve important problems in many areas. In this paper, we present a
hierarchical Bayesian model for spatio-temporal data and apply it to obtain
short term predictions of rainfall. The model incorporates physical knowledge
about the underlying processes that determine rainfall, such as advection,
diffusion and convection. It is based on a temporal autoregressive convolution
with spatially colored and temporally white innovations. By linking the
advection parameter of the convolution kernel to an external wind vector, the
model is temporally nonstationary. Further, it allows for nonseparable and
anisotropic covariance structures. With the help of the Voronoi tessellation,
we construct a natural parametrization, that is, space as well as time
resolution consistent, for data lying on irregular grid points. In the
application, the statistical model combines forecasts of three other
meteorological variables obtained from a numerical weather prediction model
with past precipitation observations. The model is then used to predict
three-hourly precipitation over 24 hours. It performs better than a separable,
stationary and isotropic version, and it performs comparably to a deterministic
numerical weather prediction model for precipitation and has the advantage that
it quantifies prediction uncertainty.

higher than an extrapolation from 5 GHz measurements assuming a free-free
spectrum on 8 arcmin scales. The SED of this cloud on angular scales of
1{\odot} is dominated by free-free emission in the cm-range. In LDN 1780 we
detected a 3 {\sigma} excess in the SED on angular scales of 1{\odot} that can
be fitted using a spinning dust model. In this cloud, there is a spatial
correlation between the CBI data and IR images, which trace dust. The
correlation is better with near-IR templates (IRAS 12 and 25 {\mu}m) than with
IRAS 100 {\mu}m, which suggests a very small grain origin for the emission at
31 GHz. We calculated the 31 GHz emissivities in both clouds. They are similar
and have intermediate values between that of cirrus clouds and dark clouds.
Nevertheless, we found an indication of an inverse relationship between
emissivity and column density, which further supports the VSGs origin for the
cm-emission since the proportion of big relative to small grains is smaller in
diffuse clouds.

superconducting mechanism is an attraction between spin vortices on two
different N\'eel sublattices, centered around the empty sites described in
terms of fermionic holons. The spin fluctuations are described by bosonic
spinons with a gap generated by the spin vortices. Due to the no-double
occupation constraint, there is a gauge attraction between holon and spinon
binding them into a physical hole. Through gauge interaction the spin vortex
attraction induces the formation of spin-singlet (RVB) spin pairs with a
owering of the spinon gap. Lowering the temperature the approach exhibits two
crossover temperatures: at the higher crossover a finite density of incoherent
holon pairs are formed leading to a reduction of the hole spectral weight, at
the lower crossover also a finite density of incoherent spinon RVB pairs are
formed, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs, and magnetic
vortices appear in the plasma phase. Finally, at a even lower temperature the
hole pairs become coherent, the magnetic vortices become dilute and
superconductivity appears. The superconducting mechanism is not of BCS-type
since it involves a gain in kinetic energy (for spinons) coming from the spin
interactions.

distinct closed path (or plaquette) joining some or all of the qubits. In
lattice gauge theory, the lattice points are the discrete space-time points,
the transformations between the points of the lattice are defined by parallel
transporters and the gauge invariant observable associated to a particular
closed path is given by the Wilson loop. In our approach the points of the
lattice are qubits, the link-transformations between the qubits are defined by
the correlations between them and the gauge invariant observable, the local
invariants associated to a particular closed path are also given by a Wilson
loop-like construction. The link transformations share many of the properties
of parallel transporters although they are not undone when one retraces one's
steps through the lattice. This feature is used to generate many of the
invariants. We consider a pure three qubit state as a test case and find we can
generate a complete set of algebraically independent local invariants in this
way, however the framework given here is applicable to mixed states composed of
any number of $d$ level quantum systems. We give an operational interpretation

  permutation patterns",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Any permutation statistic $f:\sym\to\CC$ may be represented uniquely as a,
possibly infinite, linear combination of (classical) permutation patterns: $f=
\Sigma_\tau\lambda_f(\tau)\tau$. To provide explicit expansions for certain
statistics, we introduce a new type of permutation patterns that we call mesh
patterns. Intuitively, an occurrence of the mesh pattern $p=(\pi,R)$ is an
occurrence of the permutation pattern $\pi$ with additional restrictions
specified by $R$ on the relative position of the entries of the occurrence. We
show that, for any mesh pattern $p=(\pi,R)$, we have $\lambda_p(\tau) =
(-1)^{|\tau|-|\pi|}p^{\star}(\tau)$ where $p^{\star}=(\pi,R^c)$ is the mesh
pattern with the same underlying permutation as $p$ but with complementary
restrictions. We use this result to expand some well known permutation
statistics, such as the number of left-to-right maxima, descents, excedances,
fixed points, strong fixed points, and the major index. We also show that
alternating permutations, Andr\'e permutations of the first kind and simsun
permutations occur naturally as permutations avoiding certain mesh patterns.
Finally, we provide new natural Mahonian statistics.

qualitatively similar to that observed from Her X-1 on long time scales, or

interplay of inter-particle potentials, contact forces, aggregate structure and
material properties of the bare particles. Owing to this variety of influences
experimental results from macroscopic mechanical testings were mostly compared
to time-consuming, microscopic simulations rather than to analytical theories.
The aim of the present paper was to relate both macroscopic and microscopic
mechanical data with each other and simple analytical models. We investigated
dense amorphous aggregates made from monodisperse poly-methyl methacrylate
(PMMA) particles (diameter: 1.6\mu m) via nanoindentation in combination with
confocal microscopy. The resulting macroscopic information were complemented by
the three dimensional aggregate structure as well as the microscopic strain
field. The strain field was in reasonable agreement with the predictions from
analytical continuum theories. As a consequence the measured force-depth curves
could be analyzed within a theoretical framework that has frequently been used
for nanoindentation of atomic matter such as metals, ceramics and polymers. The
extracted values for hardness and effective elastic modulus represented average
values characteristic of the aggregate. On base of these parameters we discuss
the influence of the strength of particle bonds by introducing polystyrene (PS)
between the particles.

understanding steel embrittlement. The first-principles method is used to
compute the energetic and bonding properties of aluminium and nickel at the
interfaces of the precipitates and corresponding fracture surfaces. Our results
show the segregation of aluminium and nickel at interfaces of precipitates are
both energetically favourable. We find that the interfacial cohesion of copper
precipitates is enhanced by aluminium segregation but reduced by nickel
segregation. Opposite roles can be attributed to the different symmetrical
features of the valence states for aluminium and nickel. The nickel-induced
interfacial embrittlement of copper-rich precipitates increase the
ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of ferritic steels and provides
an explanation of many experimental phenomena, such as the fact that the shifts
of DBTT of reactor pressure vessel steels depend the copper and nickel content.

a rotating black hole. Within the so called lamp-post scheme we compute the
expected (observed) polarization properties of the radiation reaching an
observer. We explore the dependencies on model parameters, employing Monte
Carlo radiation transfer computations of the X-ray reflection on the accretion
disk and taking general relativity effects into account. In particular, we
discuss the role of the black hole spin, of the observer viewing angle, and of
the primary X-ray source distance from the black hole. We give several examples
of the resulting polarization degree for two types of exemplary objects -
active galactic nuclei and Galactic black holes. In order to assess potential
observability of the polarization features, we assume the sensitivity of the
proposed New Hard X-ray Mission (NHXM).
  We examine the energy range from several keV to ~50 keV, so the iron-line
complex and the Compton hump are included in our model spectra. We find the
resultant polarization degree to increase at the higher end of the studied
energy band, i.e. at >~20 keV. Thus, the best results for polarimetry of
reflection spectra should be achieved at the Compton hump energy region. We
also obtain higher polarization degree for large spin values of the black hole,
small heights of the primary source, and low inclination angles of the
observer.

large isolation level while maintaining a straightforward technological
feasibility. Their layout is based on a nonreciprocal radial Bragg cavity
composed of concentric magneto-optical rings. The circulator ports are standard
rib waveguides, butt-coupled to the cavity by cutting through its outer rings.
The device is specifically designed for operation in a uniform external
magnetic field. Using a coupled-mode description of the complete
cavity/waveguide-port system, we explore the rich behaviour of cavity
circulators in presence of varying levels of direct port-to-port coupling. We
demonstrate numerically a strongly miniaturized two-dimensional cavity
circulator, with a total footprint of less than $(10\lambda)^2$, achieving a
20-dB isolation level at telecom frequencies over a bandwidth of 130 GHz. The
device is found to be very tolerant with respect to fabrication imperfections.
We finish with an outlook on three-dimensional versions of the proposed
nonreciprocal cavities.
