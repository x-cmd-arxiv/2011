analysing artificial agents and robots. Furthermore, they have been recently
proposed also as a source of design principles and guidelines. Boolean networks
are a prominent example of complex dynamical systems and they have been shown
to effectively capture important phenomena in gene regulation. From an
engineering perspective, these models are very compelling, because they can
exhibit rich and complex behaviours, in spite of the compactness of their
description. In this paper, we propose the use of Boolean networks for
controlling robots' behaviour. The network is designed by means of an automatic
procedure based on stochastic local search techniques. We show that this
approach makes it possible to design a network which enables the robot to
accomplish a task that requires the capability of navigating the space using a
light stimulus, as well as the formation and use of an internal memory.

encapsulation to avoid uncontrolled doping by impurities deposited in ambient

which is rather difficult to change by electrostatic gating alone.
  Here we describe one solution to these problems, allowing both encapsulation
and control of the carrier concentration in a wide range. We describe a novel
heterostructure based on epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide combined
with two polymers: a neutral spacer and a photoactive layer that provides
potent electron acceptors under UV light exposure. Unexposed, the same double
layer of polymers works well as capping material, improving the temporal
stability and uniformity of the doping level of the sample. By UV exposure of
this heterostructure we controlled electrical parameters of graphene in a
non-invasive, non-volatile, and reversible way, changing the carrier
concentration by a factor of 50. The electronic properties of the exposed SiC/
graphene/polymer heterostructures remained stable over many days at room
temperature, but heating the polymers above the glass transition reversed the
effect of light.

significantly increased breakdown current) of a graphene resistance standard to
such a level that it starts to compete favorably with mature semiconductor

the proposed policies to a more practical scenario where a SU can only imitate

However, in the alkali-metal atoms, which are commonly used, hyperfine
interaction in the excited state introduces several levels which simultaneously
participate in the scattering process. When the Doppler broadening is
comparable with the hyperfine splitting in the upper state, the three-level
Lambda model does not reproduce the experimental results. Here we theoretically
investigate the EIT in a hot vapor of alkali-metal atoms and demonstrate that

renormalizable model of inflection point inflation, with two independent
parameters. We derive constraints on the parameter space of this model arising
from the WMAP 7-year power spectrum. It has previously been shown that it is
possible to successfully embed this potential in the MSSM. Unfortunately, to do
this requires severe fine-tuning. We address this issue by introducing a hybrid
field to dynamically uplift the potential with a subsequent smooth phase
transition to end inflation at the necessary point. Large parameter regions
exist where this drastically reduces the fine-tuning required without ruining
the viability of the model. A side effect of this mechanism is that it
increases the width of the slow-roll region of the potential, thus also
alleviating the problem of the fine-tuning of initial conditions. The MSSM
embedding we study has been previously shown to be able to explain the
smallness of the neutrino masses. The hybrid transition does not spoil this
feature as there exist parameter regions where the fine-tuning parameter is as
large as $10^{-1}$ and the neutrino masses remain small.

flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. We find the current bound on
B(tau -> mu gamma) more constraining than B(B -> X_s gamma). The LEP limit on
the lightest Higgs boson mass implies an important lower bound on tan beta,
which in turn limits the size of the new FCNC transitions. Remarkably, the
combined analysis does not rule out large effects in B_s-B_s-bar mixing and we
can easily accomodate the large CP phase in the B_s-B_s-bar system which has
recently been inferred from a global analysis of CDF and DO data. The model
predicts a particle spectrum which is different from the popular Constrained
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). B(tau -> mu gamma) enforces
heavy masses, typically above 1 TeV, for the sfermions of the degenerate first

from the minimum foreground value of 0.22mag up to 0.66+-0.21mag. The
integrated FUV and NUV photometry, compared with stellar population models,
yields ages of the SF complexes up to a few hundred Myr, and masses from 2x10^2
Msun to 1.5x10^6 Msun. The derived ages and masses strongly depend on the
assumed type of interstellar selective extinction, which we find to vary across
the galaxy. The total mass of the FUV-defined SF regions translates into an
average star formation rate (SFR) of 1.4x10^-2 Msun/yr over the past 100 Myr,
and SFR=1.0x10^-2 Msun/yr in the most recent 10 Myr. The latter is in agreement

behavior of coupled discrete-time excitable cells (SIRS-like cellular
automata). Using mean-field analysis and simulations, we show that a
synchronized phase with stable collective oscillations exists even with
non-deterministic refractory periods. Moreover, further increasing the coupling
strength leads to a reentrant transition, where the synchronized phase loses
stability. In an intermediate regime, we also observe bistability (and
consequently hysteresis) between a synchronized phase and an active but
incoherent phase without oscillations. The onset of the oscillations appears in
the mean-field equations as a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, the nature of which
(i.e. super- or subcritical) is determined by the first Lyapunov coefficient.
This allows us to determine the borders of the oscillating and of the bistable
regions. The mean-field prediction thus obtained agrees quantitatively with
simulations of complete graphs and, for random graphs, qualitatively predicts
the overall structure of the phase diagram. The latter can be obtained from
simulations by defining an order parameter q suited for detecting collective
oscillations of excitable elements. We briefly review other commonly used order
parameters and show (via data collapse) that q satisfies the expected finite
size scaling relations.

accuracy of up to 1.5 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence), and the Swift

to absorption), the XRT position is good enough to allow for ground based IR

pulse-mode structure of guided quantum states of light. In addition, several
groups have started to investigate the manipulation of quantum states by means
of single-photon frequency conversion. In this paper we explore new routes

robust integrated optics devices allow for arbitrary manipulations of the

utilized to select an arbitrary pulse mode from a multimode input state,

  non-stationary time series","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering",,,,"stat.AP physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Testing for nonlinearity is one of the most important preprocessing steps in
nonlinear time series analysis. Typically, this is done by means of the linear
surrogate data methods. But it is a known fact that the validity of the results
heavily depends on the stationarity of the time series. Since most
physiological signals are non-stationary, it is easy to falsely detect
nonlinearity using the linear surrogate data methods. In this document, we
propose a methodology to extend the procedure for generating constrained
surrogate time series in order to assess nonlinearity in non-stationary data.
The method is based on the band-phase-randomized surrogates, which consists
(contrary to the linear surrogate data methods) in randomizing only a portion
of the Fourier phases in the high frequency band. Analysis of simulated time
series showed that in comparison to the linear surrogate data method, our
method is able to discriminate between linear stationarity, linear
non-stationary and nonlinear time series. When applying our methodology to
heart rate variability (HRV) time series that present spikes and other kinds of
nonstationarities, we where able to obtain surrogate time series that look like
the data and preserves linear correlations, something that is not possible to
do with the existing surrogate data methods.

positive activation energy that depends on its type. There is no binding energy
between neighboring particles of the same type. At the boundary of the box
particles are created and annihilated in a way that represents the presence of

the transition time to the full box. This transition is triggered by a
\emph{critical droplet} appearing somewhere in the box.
  We identify the region of parameters for which the system is metastable. For
this region, in the limit as the temperature tends to zero, we show that the
first entrance distribution on the set of critical droplets is uniform, compute
the expected transition time up to a multiplicative factor that tends to one,

that, theoretically, the Coulomb barrier between nuclei in the electrolyte

Unsurprisingly, this increased capability leads to increased complexity in data
analysis. Likelihood methods are ideal for connecting models with data, but the
computational cost of folding the model input through the multi-scale
instrument response function is appreciable. Both interactive analysis and
large projects---such as analysis of the full gamma-ray sky---can be
prohibitive or impossible, reducing the scope of the science possible with the
LAT. To improve on this situation, we have developed pointlike, a software
package for fast maximum likelihood analysis of LAT data. It is interactive by
design and its rapid evaluation of the likelihood facilitates exploratory and
large-scale, all-sky analysis. We detail its implementation and validate its
performance on simulated data. We demonstrate its capability for interactive
analysis and present several all-sky analyses. These include a search for new
gamma-ray sources and the selection of LAT sources with pulsar-like
characteristics for targeted radio pulsation searches. We conclude by
developing sensitive periodicity tests incorporating spectral information

UCDs generally) have properties consistent with their being the most luminous
members of the host galaxy's globular cluster (GC) system. We describe UCDs of
this type as giant GCs (GGCs). In contrast, the UCD we have found associated
with the isolated S0 NGC4546 is clearly the result of the stripping of a
nucleated companion galaxy. The young age (~3.4 Gyr) of the UCD, the lack of a
correspondingly young GC population, the apparently short dynamical friction
decay timescale (~0.5 Gyr) of the UCD, and the presence of a counterrotating
gas disc in the host galaxy (co-rotating with the UCD) together suggest that
this UCD is the liberated nucleus remaining after the recent stripping of a
companion by NGC4546. We suggest a general scheme that unifies the formation of
GCs, UCDs, and galaxy nuclei. In this picture ""normal"" GCs are a composite
population, composed of GCs formed in situ, GCs acquired from accreted
galaxies, and a population of lower mass stripped dwarf nuclei masquerading as
GCs. Above a ""scaling onset mass"" of 2x10^6 Msun (Mv ~ -10), UCDs emerge
together with a mass-size relation and a likely mass-metallicity relation (the
""blue tilt""). In the mass range up to 7x10^7 Msun (Mv ~ -13) UCDs comprise a
composite population of GGCs and stripped nuclei. Above 7x10^7 Msun, UCDs must

density profiles of cold dark matter halos are accurately described by Einasto
profiles, where the logarithmic slope is a power-law of adjustable exponent,
\gamma =dln\rho /dlnr ~ r^\alpha $. The pseudo-phase-space density (PPSD)
profiles of CDM halos also show remarkable regularity, and are well
approximated by simple power laws, Q(r)=\rho /\sigma ^3 ~ r^-\chi . We show
that this is expected from dynamical equilibrium considerations, since Jeans'
equations predict that the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of Einasto halos
should resemble power laws over a wide range of radii. For the values of \alpha
typical of CDM halos, the inner Q profiles of equilibrium halos deviate
significantly from a power law only very close to the center, and simulations
of extremely high-resolution would be needed to detect such deviations
unambiguously. We use an ensemble of halos drawn from the Millennium-II
simulation to study which of these two alternatives describe best the mass
profile of CDM halos. Our analysis indicates that at the resolution of the best
available simulations, both Einasto and power-law PPSD profiles (with
adjustable exponents \alpha and \chi, respectively) provide equally acceptable
fits to the simulations. A full account of the structure of CDM halos requires
understanding how the shape parameters that characterize departures from
self-similarity, like \alpha or \chi, are determined by evolutionary history,
environment or initial conditions.

constraints to the primordial metallicity and/or whether the standard CMB
calculations are robust, within the tolerance of forthcoming CMB maps, to the
possibility of primordial metals. Metals would affect the recombination history
(and thus CMB power spectra) in three ways: (1) Lyman-alpha photons can be
removed (and recombination thus accelerated) by photoionizing metals. (2) The
Bowen resonance-fluorescence mechanism may degrade Lyman-beta photons and thus
enhance the Lyman-beta escape probability and speed up recombination. (3)
Metals could affect the low-redshift tail of the CMB visibility function by
providing additional free electrons. The last two of these provide the
strongest CMB signal. However, the effects are detectable in the Planck
satellite only if the primordial metal abundance is at least a few hundredths
of solar for (2) and a few tenths of solar for (3). We thus conclude that
Planck will not be able to improve upon current constraints to primordial
metallicity, at the level of a thousandth of solar, from the Lyman-alpha forest
and ultra-metal-poor halo stars, and that the CMB power-spectrum predictions
for Planck suffer no uncertainty arising from the possibility that there may be
primordial metals.

formation history (SFH), can be used to derive the delay-time distribution
(DTD) of SNe Ia, which can distinguish among progenitor models. We present the
results of a SN survey in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). Over a period of 3
years, we have observed the SDF on 4 independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the
Subaru 8.2-m telescope, with 2 nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i', and
z' bands. We have discovered 150 SNe out to redshift z~2. Using 11 photometric
bands from the observer-frame far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we derive
photometric redshifts for the SN host galaxies (for 24 we also have
spectroscopic redshifts). This information is combined with the SN photometry
to determine the type and redshift distribution of the SN sample. Our final
sample includes 28 SNe Ia in the range 1.0<z<1.5 and 10 in the range 1.5<z<2.0.
Our SN Ia rate measurements are consistent with those derived from the
HST/GOODS sample, but the overall uncertainty of our 1.5<z<2.0 measurement is a
factor of 2 smaller, of 35-50%. We find that the SN Ia rate evolution levels
off at 1.0<z<2.0, but shows no sign of declining. Combining our SN Ia rate
measurements and those from the literature, and comparing to a wide range of
possible SFHs, the best-fit DTD is a power law of the form Psi(t) ~ t^beta,
with beta = -1.1 +/- 0.1 (statistical) +/- 0.17 (systematic). This result is
consistent with other recent DTD measurements at various redshifts and
environments, and is in agreement with a generic prediction of the
double-degenerate progenitor scenario for SNe Ia. By combining the contribution
to iron production from core-collapse SNe, based on the wide range of SFHs,
with that from SNe Ia, calculated with the best-fit DTD, we predict that the
mean present-day cosmic iron abundance is in the range Z(Fe) = (0.09-0.37)

been analyzed to date using the thermal continuum fitting method, and the
spectral fits have been used to estimate the spin parameters of the black
holes. However, the underlying model used in this method of estimating spin is
the general relativistic thin-disc model of Novikov & Thorne, which is only
valid for razor-thin discs. We therefore expect errors in the measured values
of spin due to inadequacies in the theoretical model. We investigate this issue
by computing spectra of numerically calculated models of thin accretion discs
around black holes, obtained via three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. We apply the continuum fitting method
to these computed spectra to estimate the black hole spins and check how
closely the values match the actual spin used in the GRMHD simulations. We find
that the error in the dimensionless spin parameter is up to about 0.2 for a
non-spinning black hole, depending on the inclination. For black holes with
spins of 0.7, 0.9 and 0.98, the errors are up to about 0.1, 0.03 and 0.01
respectively. These errors are comparable to or smaller than those arising from
current levels of observational uncertainty. Furthermore, we estimate that the
GRMHD simulated discs from which these error estimates are obtained correspond
to effective disc luminosities of about 0.4-0.7 Eddington, and that the errors
will be smaller for discs with luminosities of 0.3 Eddington or less, which are
used in the continuum-fitting method. We thus conclude that use of the
Novikov-Thorne thin-disc model does not presently limit the accuracy of the
continuum-fitting method of measuring black hole spin.

Calabi-Yau compactifications without Neveu-Schwarz three-form flux. This is
accomplished using the gauge bundle required in any heterotic compactification,
whose perturbative effects on the moduli are combined with non-perturbative
corrections. We argue that, for appropriate gauge bundles, all complex
structure and a large number of other moduli can be perturbatively stabilized -
in the most restrictive case, leaving only one combination of Kahler moduli and
the dilaton as a flat direction. At this stage, the remaining moduli space
consists of Minkowski vacua. That is, the perturbative superpotential vanishes
in the vacuum without the necessity to fine-tune flux. Finally, we incorporate
non-perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation and/or instantons. These
are strongly constrained by the anomalous U(1) symmetries which arise from the
required bundle constructions. We present a specific example, with a consistent
choice of non-perturbative effects, where all remaining flat directions are
stabilized in an AdS vacuum.

the influence of Newton attraction are mathematically more interesting to study
when space dimension is at least 4: On the one hand, in a higher dimensional
space, a relative equilibrium is determined not only by the initial
configuration but also by the choice of a complex structure on the space where
the motion takes place; in particular, its angular momentum depends on this
choice; On the other hand, relative equilibria are not necessarily periodic: if
the configuration is ""balanced"" but not central, the motion is in general
quasi-periodic. In this exploratory paper we address the following question,
which touches both aspects: what are the possible frequencies of the angular
momentum of a given central (or balanced) configuration and at what values of
these frequencies bifurcations from periodic to quasi-periodic relative
equilibria do occur ? We give a full answer for relative equilibrium motions in
dimension 4 and conjecture that an analogous situation holds true for higher
dimensions. A refinement of Horn's problem given by Fomin, Fulton, Li and Poon
plays an important role.

Milky Way close to base of the Scutum-Crux Arm and the tip of the Long Bar.
Population synthesis models indicate that they must be very massive to harbour
so many supergiants. The spatial extent of one of these clusters, RSGC3, has
not been investigated. We utilised 2MASS JHK photometry to identify candidate
obscured luminous red stars in the vicinity of RSGC3. We observed a sample of
candidates with the TWIN spectrograph on the 3.5-m telescope at Calar Alto,
obtaining intermediate-resolution spectroscopy in the 8000-9000A range. We
re-evaluated a number of classification criteria proposed in the literature for
this spectral range and found that we could use our spectra to derive spectral
types and luminosity classes. We measured the radial velocity of five members
of RSGC3, finding velocities similar to the average for members of Stephenson2.
Among the candidates observed outside the cluster, our spectra revealed eight
M-type supergiants at distances <18arcmin from the centre of RSGC3, distributed
in two clumps. The southern clump is most likely another cluster of red
supergiants, with reddening and age identical to RSGC3. From 2MASS photometry,
we identified four likely supergiant members of the cluster in addition to the
five spectroscopically observed. The northern clump may be a small cluster with
similar parameters. Photometric analysis of the area around RSGC3 suggests the
presence of a large (>30) population of red supergiants with similar colours,
suggesting that the massive cluster RSGC3 is surrounded by an extended
association, which may be very massive (>10E5M_sun). We also show that
supergiants in the Scutum Complex may be characterised via a combination of
2MASS photometry and intermediate-to-high-resolution spectroscopy in the Z band

for a group of agents with only shape constraints but with a flexible scale.
Instead of assigning the formation system with a specific geometry, here the
only requirement on the desired geometry is a shape without any location,
rotation and, most importantly, scale constraints. Optimal rigid transformation
between two different geometries is discussed with especial focus on the
scaling operation, and the cooperative performance of the system is evaluated
by what we call the geometries degrees of similarity (DOS) with respect to the
desired shape during the entire convergence process. The design of the scale
when measuring the DOS is discussed from constant value and time-varying
function perspectives respectively. Fixed structured nonlinear control laws
that are functions on the scale are developed to guarantee the exponential
convergence of the system to the assigned shape. Our research is originated
from a three-agent formation system and is further extended to multiple (n > 3)
agents by defining a triangular complement graph. Simulations demonstrate that
formation system with the time-varying scale function outperforms the one with
an arbitrary constant scale, and the relationship between underlying topology
and the system performance is further discussed based on the simulation
observations. Moveover, the control scheme is applied to bearing-only
sensor-target localization to show its application potentials.

lead to surprising consequences. These include time-reversal symmetry breaking

  Theory, Special Issue on Interference Networks, 2011",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the Gaussian interference channel with an intermediate relay as a
main building block for cooperative interference networks. On the achievability
side, we consider compress-and-forward based strategies. Specifically, a
generalized compress-and-forward strategy, where the destinations jointly
decode the compression indices and the source messages, is shown to improve
upon the compress-and-forward strategy which sequentially decodes the
compression indices and source messages, and the recently proposed generalized
hash-and-forward strategy. We also construct a nested lattice code based
compute-and-forward relaying scheme, which outperforms other relaying schemes
when the direct link is weak. In this case, it is shown that, with a relay, the
interference link can be useful for decoding the source messages. Noting the
need for upperbounding the capacity for this channel, we propose a new
technique with which the sum rate can be bounded. In particular, the sum
capacity is upperbounded by considering the channel when the relay node has
abundant power and is named potent for that reason. For the Gaussian
interference relay channel with potent relay, we study the strong and the weak
interference regimes and establish the sum capacity, which, in turn, serve as
upperbounds for the sum capacity of the GIFRC with finite relay power.
Numerical results demonstrate that upperbounds are tighter than the cut-set
bound, and coincide with known achievable sum rates for many scenarios of
interest. Additionally, the degrees of freedom of the GIFRC are shown to be 2
when the relay has large power, achievable using compress-and-forward.

oxygen abundance gradient measured from the detection of the [O III]4363
auroral line displays a scatter of approximately 0.06 dex, a much smaller value
than recently reported by Rosolowsky & Simon in this galaxy. The analysis of
the abundances for a large sample of H II regions derived from the R23
strong-line indicator confirms that the scatter is small over the full disk of
M33, consistent with the measuring uncertainties, and comparable to what is
observed in other spiral galaxies. No evidence is therefore found for
significant azimuthal variations in the present-day metallicity of the
interstellar medium in this galaxy on spatial scales from ~100 pc to a few kpc.
A considerable fraction of M33 H II regions with auroral line detections show
spectral features revealing sources of hard ionizing radiation (such as He II

severely underestimate the oxygen abundances in such cases, care must be taken

describe the dynamics of classical systems of particles in or out of

for the single-particle phase-space distribution function $f$, the correlation
function $C=<\delta f\delta f >$, the retarded and advanced density response
functions $\chi^{R,A}=\delta f/\delta\phi$ to an external potential $\phi$, and
the associated memory functions $\Sigma^{R,A,C}$. The basis of the theory is an
effective action functional $\Omega$ of external potentials $\phi$ that
contains all information about the dynamical properties of the system. In
particular, its functional derivatives generate successively the
single-particle phase-space density $f$ and all the correlation and density
response functions, which are coupled through an infinite hierarchy of
evolution equations. Traditional renormalization techniques are then used to
perform the closure of the hierarchy through memory functions. The latter
satisfy functional equations that can be used to devise systematic
approximations. The present formulation can be equally regarded as (i) a
generalization to dynamical problems of the density functional theory of fluids
in equilibrium and (ii) as the classical mechanical counterpart of the theory
of non-equilibrium Green's functions in quantum field theory. It unifies and
encompasses previous results for classical Hamiltonian systems with any initial
conditions. For equilibrium states, the theory reduces to the equilibrium
memory function approach. For non-equilibrium fluids, popular closures (e.g.

mass function. The computation of the mass function is mapped into the
so-called first-passage time problem in the presence of a moving barrier. The
excursion set theory is also a powerful formalism to study other properties of
dark matter halos such as halo bias, accretion rate, formation time, merging
rate and the formation history of halos. This is achieved by computing
conditional probabilities with non-trivial initial conditions, and the
conditional two-barrier first-crossing rate. In this paper we use the path
integral formulation of the excursion set theory to calculate analytically
these conditional probabilities in the presence of a generic moving barrier,
including the one describing the ellipsoidal collapse, and for both Gaussian

Gaussian initial conditions assumes Markovianity (top-hat in momentum space
smoothing, rather than generic filters), the non-Markovianity of the random
walks induced by non-Gaussianity is consistently accounted for. We compute, for
a generic barrier, the first two scale-independent halo bias parameters, the
conditional mass function and the halo formation time probability, including
the effects of non-Gaussianities. We also provide the expression for the
two-constant-barrier first-crossing rate when non-Markovian effects are induced

variability and expense. We propose an algorithm - Tissue Array Co-Occurrence
Matrix Analysis (TACOMA) - for quantifying cellular phenotypes based on
textural regularity summarized by local inter-pixel relationships. The
algorithm can be easily trained for any staining pattern, is absent of
sensitive tuning parameters and has the ability to report salient pixels in an
image that contribute to its score. Pathologists' input via informative
training patches is an important aspect of the algorithm that allows the
training for any specific marker or cell type. With co-training, the error rate
of TACOMA can be reduced substantially for a very small training sample (e.g.,
with size 30). We give theoretical insights into the success of co-training via
thinning of the feature set in a high-dimensional setting when there is
""sufficient"" redundancy among the features. TACOMA is flexible, transparent and
provides a scoring process that can be evaluated with clarity and confidence.
In a study based on an estrogen receptor (ER) marker, we show that TACOMA is

For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to be

mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and NH3 are photochemically
removed at higher altitudes. Atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons
(particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like OH,
CH3, and NH2 are enhanced overequilibrium predictions because of quenching and
photochemistry. In contrast, CO, H2O, N2, and CO2 more closely follow their
equilibrium profiles, except at pressures < 1 microbar, where CO, H2O, and N2
are photochemically destroyed and CO2 is produced before its eventual
high-altitude destruction. The enhanced abundances of HCN, CH4, and NH3 in
particular are expected to affect the spectral signatures and thermal profiles

bounds have implications for algebraic circuit/formula lower bounds.
  We explore tensor rank lower and upper bounds, focusing on explicit tensors.
For odd d, we construct field-independent explicit 0/1 tensors T:[n]^d->F with
rank at least 2n^(floor(d/2))+n-Theta(d log n). This matches (over F_2) or
improves (all other fields) known lower bounds for d=3 and improves (over any
field) for odd d>3.
  We also explore a generalization of permutation matrices, which we denote
permutation tensors. We show, by counting, that there exists an order-3
permutation tensor with super-linear rank. We also explore a natural class of
permutation tensors, which we call group tensors. For any group G, we define
the group tensor T_G^d:G^d->F, by T_G^d(g_1,...,g_d)=1 iff g_1 x ... x g_d=1_G.
We give two upper bounds for the rank of these tensors. The first uses
representation theory and works over large fields F, showing (among other
things) that rank_F(T_G^d)<= |G|^(d/2). We also show that if this upper bound
is tight, then super-linear tensor rank lower bounds would follow. The second
upper bound uses interpolation and only works for abelian G, showing that over
any field F that rank_F(T_G^d)<= O(|G|^(1+log d)log^(d-1)|G|). In either case,
this shows that many permutation tensors have far from maximal rank, which is
very different from the matrix case and thus eliminates many natural candidates
for high tensor rank.
  We also explore monotone tensor rank. We give explicit 0/1 tensors T:[n]^d->F
that have tensor rank at most dn but have monotone tensor rank exactly n^(d-1).
This is a nearly optimal separation.

depends on the cavity decay rate, the atom-field coupling strength and the
number of atoms. Then, considering only two atoms inside the cavity and working
in the steady state of the system, we note that the entanglement between the
atoms disappears with the increasing the mean number of photons of the cavity
field (n). However, the quantum discord reaches an asymptotic non-zero value,
even in the limit of n\rightarrow \infty. This happens either by increasing n
coherently (applying a coherent driving field) or incoherently (raising the
temperature of the reservoir coupled to the cavity mode). Therefore, the cavity
mode, which is quantum by construction, always preserves its quantum behavior
in the asymptotic limit and this is revealed only by the quantum discord.

The spin of the NV center is a three-level system, with two levels forming a

rotation, and the third level being idle. We find that the bang-bang control

like the b-quark mass mb, the heavy-light decay constant(s) or the B-meson
spectrum can be computed precisely beyond the static approximation (including
the first corrections in 1/\mb). More recently, we have started to include the

the equivalence of these two Hamiltonian formulations and their equivalence to
the original formulation of General Relativity. We argue that, since the
transformation from components of metric tensor to the ADM variables touches
gauge degrees of freedom, which are non-canonical from the point of view of
Dirac, the problem cannot be resolved in the limits of the Dirac approach. The
proposed solution requires the extension of phase space by treating gauge
degrees of freedom on an equal footing with other variables and introducing
missing velocities into the Lagrangian by means of gauge conditions in
differential form. We illustrate with a simple cosmological model the features
of Hamiltonian dynamics in extended phase space. Then, we give a clear proof
for the full gravitational theory that the ADM-like transformation is canonical
in extended phase space in a wide enough class of possible parametrizations.

follows a slow wind phase, the fast wind sweeps up the slow wind in a shell,
which can be observed as a circumstellar nebula.
  One of the most striking examples of such an interaction is when a massive
star changes from a red supergiant into a Wolf-Rayet star. Nebulae resulting
from such a transition have been observed around many Wolf-Rayet stars and show
detailed, complicated structures owing to local instabilities in the swept-up
shells.
  Shells also form in the case of massive binary stars, where the winds of two
stars collide with one another. Along the collision front gas piles up, forming
a shell that rotates along with the orbital motion of the binary stars. In this
case the shell follows the surface along which the ram pressure of the two
colliding winds is in balance.
  Using the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code we have made multi-dimensional
simulations of these interactions in order to model the formation and evolution
of these circumstellar nebulae and explore whether full 3D simulations are
necessary to obtain accurate models of such nebulae.

the ATP binding cassette family of transport proteins, is found in the plasma
membrane of animal cells where it is involved in the ATP hydrolysis driven
export of hydrophobic molecules. When expressed in the plasma membrane of
cancer cells, the transport activity of Pgp can lead to the failure of
chemotherapy by excluding the mostly hydrophobic drugs from the interior of the
cell. Despite ongoing effort, the catalytic mechanism by which Pgp couples
MgATP binding and hydrolysis to translocation of drug molecules across the
lipid bilayer is poorly understood. Using site directed mutagenesis, we have
introduced cysteine residues for fluorescence labeling into different regions
of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of Pgp. Double-labeled single Pgp
molecules showed fluctuating FRET efficiencies during drug stimulated ATP
hydrolysis suggesting that the NBDs undergo significant movements during
catalysis. Duty cycle-optimized alternating laser excitation (DCO-ALEX) is
applied to minimize FRET artifacts and to select the appropriate molecules. The
data show that Pgp is a highly dynamic enzyme that appears to fluctuate between
at least two major conformations during steady state turnover.

techniques in both clinical diagnostic medical field and biomedicine, as it
allows to obtain images anatomy of the body and its various parts and

based on the interaction of nuclei with magnetic spin number different from
zero with the magnetic field outside and, in theory, could be used for the
analysis of different nuclei, such as 1H, 13C, 31P (endogenous) or 129 Xe, 3He

of 1H that, compared to the others, manifest the highest concentration in the
human body. The use of contrast media usually lengthens the execution time of
an examination of MRI. These, however, would greatly directly reduce by
increasing the intensity of the substrate signal. This can be achieved through
an increase in the substrate polarization via the creation of an equilibrium
state where the population difference between levels is increased. This state
is called hyperpolarized. In recent years have been designed and developed
several techniques for achieving this goal. Hyperpolarized contrast agents
therefore act very differently from classical ones, because, instead of
modifying the signal due the protons surrounding themselves, become themselves
a source of signal. In order to be functional such contrast agents should be
characterized by a high longitudinal relaxation time T1, because the
hyperpolarized state must remain as long as possible after injection into the
circulatory system of the patient.

created by the absorption and conversion of a stopped $\Xi^{-}$ hyperon. Rather
independent on the spectrum of possible excited states in the produced double

possible. We also confront our predictions with the correlated pion spectra

two behaviours of the correlation function occurs when the amplitude of the

problem is to find the diffusion coefficient for a linear uniformly elliptic

adopt a Bayesian approach to the problem. We place a prior random field measure
on the log permeability, specified through the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of
its draws. We consider Gaussian measures constructed this way, and study the
regularity of functions drawn from them. We also study the Lipschitz properties
of the observation operator mapping the log permeability to the observations.
Combining these regularity and continuity estimates, we show that the posterior
measure is well-defined on a suitable Banach space. Furthermore the posterior
measure is shown to be Lipschitz with respect to the data in the Hellinger
metric, giving rise to a form of well-posedness of the inverse problem.
Determining the posterior measure, given the data, solves the problem of
uncertainty quantification for this inverse problem. In practice the posterior
measure must be approximated in a finite dimensional space. We quantify the
errors incurred by employing a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion to
represent this meausure. In particular we study weak convergence of a general
class of locally Lipschitz functions of the log permeability, and apply this
general theory to estimate errors in the posterior mean of the pressure and the
pressure covariance, under refinement of the finite dimensional
Karhunen-Lo\`eve truncation.

chosen minimal in a least-square sense. We are especially interested in two
situations: a single active species moves in a passive matrix (cell migration)
with a given desired velocity, and a closed-loop Keller-Segel type model, where
the desired velocity is the gradient of a self-emitted chemoattractant. We
propose a theoretical framework for the open-loop model (desired velocities are
defined as gradients of given functions) based on a formulation in the form of
a gradient flow in the Wasserstein space. We propose a numerical strategy to
discretize the model, and illustrate its behaviour in the case of a prescribed
velocity, and for the saturated Keller-Segel model.

systems, for the first time in RR Lyrae models. These studies provide
theoretical background for the recent discovery of period doubling in some
Blazhko RR Lyrae stars with the Kepler space telescope. Since period doubling
was observed only in Blazhko-modulated stars so far, the phenomenon can help in
the understanding of the modulation as well. Utilising the Florida-Budapest
turbulent convective hydrodynamical code, we identified the phenomenon in
radiative and convective models as well. A period-doubling cascade was also
followed up to an eight-period solution confirming that the destabilisation of
the limit cycle is indeed the underlying phenomenon. Floquet stability roots
were calculated to investigate the possible causes and occurrences of the
phenomenon. A two-dimensional diagnostic diagram was constructed to display the
various resonances between the fundamental mode and the different overtones.
Combining the two tools, we confirmed that the period-doubling instability is
caused by a 9:2 resonance between the 9th overtone and the fundamental mode.
Destabilisation of the limit cycle by a resonance of a high-order mode is
possible because the overtone is a strange mode. The resonance is found to be
sufficiently strong enough to shift the period of overtone with up to 10
percent. Our investigations suggest that a more complex interplay of radial
(and presumably non-radial) modes could happen in RR Lyrae stars that might
have connections with the Blazhko effect as well.

undergoing slow Hebbian learning can extract the underlying geometry of an
input space. First, we use a slow/fast analysis to derive an averaged system
whose dynamics derives from an energy function and therefore always converges
to equilibrium points. The equilibria reflect the correlation structure of the
inputs, a global object extracted through local recurrent interactions only.
Second, we use numerical methods to illustrate how learning extracts the hidden
geometrical structure of the inputs. Indeed, multidimensional scaling methods
make it possible to project the final connectivity matrix on to a distance
matrix in a high-dimensional space, with the neurons labelled by spatial
position within this space. The resulting network structure turns out to be
roughly convolutional. The residual of the projection defines the
non-convolutional part of the connectivity which is minimized in the process.
Finally, we show how restricting the dimension of the space where the neurons
live gives rise to patterns similar to cortical maps. We motivate this using an
energy efficiency argument based on wire length minimization. Finally, we show
how this approach leads to the emergence of ocular dominance or orientation
columns in primary visual cortex. In addition, we establish that the
non-convolutional (or long-range) connectivity is patchy, and is co-aligned in
the case of orientation learning.

established. As such, c-axis superconductivity can be weakened if a strong
electric field is applied along the c axis. We use high-field single-cycle
terahertz pulses to gate interlayer coupling in La1.84Sr0.16CuO4. We induce
ultrafast oscillations between superconducting and resistive states and switch
the plasmon response on and off, without reducing the density of Cooper pairs.
Indeed, in-plane superconductivity remains unperturbed throughout, revealing a
non-equilibrium state in which the dimensionality of the superconductor is time
dependent. The gating frequency is determined by the electric field strength,
in the spirit of the ac Josephson effect. Non-dissipative, bi-directional
gating of superconductive coupling is of interest for device applications in
ultrafast nanoelectronics. It is also a new example of nonlinear terahertz
physics, applicable to nanoplasmonics and active metamaterials.

occurring in high-temperature, low-density astrophysical accretion disks, such
as are thought to be present in some radiatively-inefficient accretion flows
onto black holes. Quasi-stationary configurations are investigated, within the
framework of a Vlasov-Maxwell description. The plasma is taken to be
axisymmetric and subject to the action of slowly time-varying gravitational and
electromagnetic fields. The magnetic field is assumed to be characterized by a
family of locally nested but open magnetic surfaces. The slow collisionless
dynamics of these plasmas is investigated, yielding a reduced gyrokinetic
Vlasov equation for the kinetic distribution function. For doing this, an
asymptotic quasi-stationary solution is first determined, represented by a
generalized bi-Maxwellian distribution expressed in terms of the relevant
adiabatic invariants. The existence of the solution is shown to depend on
having suitable kinetic constraints and conditions leading to particle trapping
phenomena. With this solution one can treat temperature anisotropy, toroidal
and poloidal flow velocities and finite Larmor-radius effects. An asymptotic
expansion for the distribution function permits analytic evaluation of all of
the relevant fluid fields. Basic theoretical features of the solution and their
astrophysical implications are discussed. As an application, the possibility of
describing the dynamics of slowly time-varying accretion flows and the
self-generation of magnetic field by means of a \textquotedblleft kinetic

performed to study a magnetic transition in jarosite, a spin-5/2 kagome lattice
antiferromagnet. When a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the kagome
plane, magnetizations in the ordered state show a sudden increase at a critical
field H_c, indicative of the transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
states. This sudden increase arises as the spins on alternate kagome planes
rotate 180 degrees to ferromagnetically align the canted moments along the
field direction. The canted moment on a single kagome plane is a result of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. For H < H_c, the weak ferromagnetic
interlayer coupling forces the spins to align in such an arrangement that the
canted components on any two adjacent layers are equal and opposite, yielding a
zero net magnetic moment. For H > H_c, the Zeeman energy overcomes the
interlayer coupling causing the spins on the alternate layers to rotate,
aligning the canted moments along the field direction. Neutron scattering
measurements provide the first direct evidence of this 180-degree spin rotation
at the transition.

center (GC), Sgr A*, is subject to frequent flares visible simultaneously in
X-rays and near-infrared (NIR). Often, enhanced radio variability from
centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelengths is observed to follow these X-ray/NIR
eruptions. We present here a multi-wavelength campaign carried out in April
2009, with the aim of characterizing this broadband flaring activity.
Concurrent data from the XMM-Newton/EPIC (2-10 keV), VLT/NACO (2.1 microns, 3.8
microns), APEX/LABOCA (870 microns), and Fermi/LAT (0.1-200 GeV) instruments
are employed to derive light curves and spectral energy distributions of new
flares from Sgr A*. We detected two relatively bright NIR flares both
associated with weak X-ray activity, one of which was followed by a strong
sub-mm outburst 200 min later. Photometric spectral information on a NIR flare
was obtained for the first time with NACO giving a power-law photon index
alpha=-0.4\pm0.3. The first attempt to detect flaring activity from the Fermi
GC source 1FGL J1745.6-2900 is also reported. NIR, X-ray, and sub-mm flares are
finally modeled in the context of non-thermal emission processes. It is found
that the simplest scenario involving a single expanding plasmoid releasing
synchrotron NIR/sub-mm and synchrotron self-Compton X-ray radiation is
inadequate to reproduce the data, but suggestions to reconcile the basic
elements of the theory and the observations are proposed.

conventional wisdom, this happens through the spontaneous breaking of gauge
symmetry. Yet, gauge symmetries merely reflect a redundancy in the state
description and therefore the spontaneous breaking can not be an essential
ingredient. Indeed, as already shown by Higgs and Kibble, the mechanism can be
explained in terms of gauge invariant variables, without invoking spontaneous
symmetry breaking. In this paper, we present a general discussion of such gauge
invariant treatments for the case of the Abelian Higgs model, in the context of
classical field theory. We thereby distinguish between two different notions of
gauge: one that takes all local transformations to be gauge and one that
relates gauge to a failure of determinism.

Zeroth Law cannot be satisfied with non-additive composition rules. In this
paper we determine the general functional form of those non-additive
composition rules which are compatible with the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics.
We find that this general form is additive for the formal logarithms of the
original quantities and the familiar relations of thermodynamics apply to
these. Our result offers a possible solution to the longstanding problem about
equilibrium between extensive and non-extensive systems or systems with
different non-extensivity parameters.

thermodynamics. Caratheodory's principle is also considered as a different form
of this law. Landsberg deduced Caratheodory's principle from Kelvin's postulate
and Dunning-Davies deduced its converse to show the equivalence of the two
principles, and these deductions remained forerunners for later works. Here we
show that these deductions are flawed and therefore, invalid. The fallacies in
these works arose due to the fact that these authors had taken an inadmissible
form of statement of Kevin's postulate and had considered an inappropriate
cyclic process, for their deductions. The equivalence between Caratheodory's
principle and Kelvin's principle of the second law, therefore, remains
unproved.
