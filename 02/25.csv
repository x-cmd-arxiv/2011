on the opacity of iron-group elements. As many of those stars naturally occur
in young open clusters, whose metallicities can be determined in several

Str\""omgren-Crawford uvbybeta photometry of open cluster target stars was
carried out to determine effective temperatures, luminosities, and therefore
cluster memberships. In the course of three observing runs, uvbybeta photometry
for 168 target stars was acquired and transformed into the standard system by
measurements of 117 standard stars. The list of target stars also included some
known cluster and field beta Cephei stars, as well as beta Cephei and SPB
candidates that are targets of the asteroseismic part of the Kepler satellite
mission. The uvbybeta photometric results are presented. The data are shown to
be on the standard system, and the properties of the target stars are
discussed: 140 of these are indeed OB stars, a total of 101 targets lie within
the beta Cephei and/or SPB star instability strips, and each investigated
cluster contains such potential pulsators. These measurements will be taken
advantage of in a number of subsequent publications.

show that there is a maximal number of particles per qubit, namely 4, and more
generally a maximal number of particles for qudits of dimension d. We also look
at the possibility of having topological qubits for which one can perform
two-qubit gates without leakage into non-computational states. It turns out
that the requirement that all two-qubit gates are leakage free is very
restrictive and this property can only be realized for two-qubit systems

HeI5876 and NaID lines were obtained for each spectrum; the Halpha line width
at 10% of peak intensity (W10) and profile shapes were also measured and
classified. The mean line strengths and relative variabilities were quantified
for each star. Simultaneous optical photometry was used to estimate the line
fluxes.
  We present a homogeneous spectroscopic database of HAeBe stars. The lines are
variable in practically all stars and timescales, although 30 % of the objects
show a constant EW in [OI]6300, which is also the only line that shows no
variability on timescales of hours. The HeI5876 and NaID EW relative
variabilities are typically the largest, followed by those in [OI]6300 and
Halpha. The EW changes can be larger than one order of magnitude for the
HeI5876 line, and up to a factor 4 for Halpha. The [OI]6300 and Halpha EW
relative variabilities are correlated for most stars in the sample. The Halpha
mean EW and W10 are uncorrelated, as are their relative variabilities. The
Halpha profile changes in 70 % of the objects. The massive stars in the sample
usually show more stable Halpha profiles with blueshifted self-absorptions and
less variable 10% widths.
  Our data suggest multiple causes for the different line variations, but the
[OI]6300 and Halpha variability must share a similar origin in many objects.
The physical mechanism responsible for the Halpha line broadening does not
depend on the amount of emission; unlike in lower-mass stars, physical
properties based on the Halpha luminosity and W10 would significantly differ.
Our results provide additional support to previous works that reported
different physical mechanisms in Herbig Ae and Herbig Be stars.

dynamical generation of the Maxwell term is correlated to the scale invariance
properties of the system. This is discussed mainly in the cases where the gauge
coupling carries dimensions. The term is generated when the theory contains a
scale explicitly, when it is asymptotically free and in particular also when
the scale invariance is spontaneously broken. The terms are not generated when
the scale invariance is maintained. Examples studied include the large $N$
limit of the $CP^{N-1}$ model in $(2+\epsilon)$ dimensions, a 3D gauged
$\phi^6$ vector model and its supersymmetric extension. In the latter case the
generation of the Maxwell term at a fixed point is explored. The phase
structure of the $d=3$ case is investigated in the presence of a Chern-Simons
term as well. In the supersymmetric $\phi^6$ model the emergence of the Maxwell
term is accompanied by the dynamical generation of the Chern-Simons term and
its multiplet and dynamical breaking of the parity symmetry. In some of the
phases long range forces emerge which may result in logarithmic confinement.
These include a dilaton exchange which plays a role also in the case when the
theory has no gauge symmetry. Gauged Lagrangian realizations of the 2D coset
models do not lead to emergent Maxwell terms. We discuss a case where the gauge
symmetry is anomalous.

polarization position angle at 2 microns (theta2m) is consistent with the
average for the optical spectrum (thetav), implying that the nuclear
polarization is dominated by polar scattering at both wavelengths. The same is
probably true for NGC 3227. In both NGC 4593 and Mrk 766, there is a large
difference between theta2m and thetav off nucleus, where polar scattering is
expected to dominate. This may be due to contamination by interstellar
polarization in NGC 4593, but there is no clear explanation in the case of the

spectra are dominated by a smooth, power-law continuum which arises in a
relativistic jet. However, the spectra are not necessarily featureless; weak,
broad- and/or narrow-line emission is sometimes seen in high-quality optical
spectra. We present detections of Lya emission in HST/COS spectra of Mrk421
(z=0.030) and PKS2005-489 (z=0.071) as well as an archival HST/GHRS observation
of Mrk501 (z=0.0337). Archival HST/STIS observations of PKS2155-304 (z=0.116)
show no Lya emission to a very low upper limit. Using the assumption that the
broad-line region (BLR) clouds are asymmetrically placed around the AGN, we use
these measured Lya emission features to constrain either the relativistic Gamma
values for the ionizing continuum produced by the jet (in the
ionization-bounded case) or the mass of warm gas (in the density-bounded case).
While realistic Gamma values can be obtained for all four cases, the values for
Mrk421 and PKS2155-304 are high enough to suggest that covering factors of
broad-line-region clouds of ~1-2% might be required to provide consistency with
earlier values of Doppler boosting and viewing angles suggested for this class
of BL Lacs. This discrepancy also exists in the case of M87, where the amount
of Doppler boosting in our direction is expected to be minimal, again
suggestive of a small covering factor of broad-line-region clouds. If, as these
small covering factors might suggest, the assumptions of a density-bounded
model could be more correct, then the observed Lya luminosities require that
BL\,Lac/FRI nuclei possess very little warm gas (10^-4 to 10^-5 Msun) as
suggested by Guilbert, Fabian & McCray (1983). If these clouds are in pressure
balance with a hotter (~10^6 K) gas, the BLR contains too little mass to power
the AGN by accretion alone.

industry. Due to numerous limitations in sharing real-world graphs, models for
generating massive graphs are critical for developing better algorithms. In
this paper, we analyze the stochastic Kronecker graph model (SKG), which is the
foundation of the Graph500 supercomputer benchmark due to its favorable
properties and easy parallelization. Our goal is to provide a deeper
understanding of the parameters and properties of this model so that its
functionality as a benchmark is increased. We develop a rigorous mathematical
analysis that shows this model cannot generate a power-law distribution or even
a lognormal distribution. However, we formalize an enhanced version of the SKG
model that uses random noise for smoothing. We prove both in theory and in
practice that this enhancement leads to a lognormal distribution. Additionally,
we provide a precise analysis of isolated vertices, showing that the graphs
that are produced by SKG might be quite different than intended. For example,
between 50% and 75% of the vertices in the Graph500 benchmarks will be
isolated. Finally, we show that this model tends to produce extremely small
core numbers (compared to most social networks and other real graphs) for
common parameter choices.

poorly constrained. Aims: The X-ray binary and microquasar black hole candidate
XTE J1550-564 exhibited a faint X-ray outburst in April 2003 during which it
stayed in the X-ray low/hard state. We took optical and near-infrared (NIR)
observations with the ESO/NTT telescope during this outburst to disentangle the
various contributions to the spectral energy distribution (SED) and investigate
the presence of a jet component. Methods: Photometric and spectroscopic
observations allowed us to construct an SED and also to produce a high
time-resolution lightcurve. Results: The SED shows an abrupt change of slope
from the NIR domain to the optical. The NIR emission is attributed to
non-thermal synchrotron emission from the compact, self-absorbed jet that is
known to be present in the low/hard state. This is corroborated by the fast
variability, colours, lack of prominent spectral features and evidence for
intrinsic polarisation. The SED suggests the jet break from the optically thick
to the thin regime occurs in the NIR. Conclusions: The simultaneous optical-NIR
data allow an independent confirmation of jet emission in the NIR. The
transition to optically thin synchrotron occurs at NIR frequencies or below,
which leads to an estimated characteristic size greater than 2x10^8cm and
magnetic field less than 5T for the jet base, assuming a homogeneous one-zone
synchrotron model.

(amplitude damping and phase damping) is approximately similar. However,

significant reduction in payoffs due to decoherence is well compensated due to
the presence of correlated noise. However, the Nash equilibrium of the game
does not change in the presence of noise. It is seen that in case of
generalized amplitude damping channel, entanglement plays a significant role at
lower level of decoherence. The channel has less dominant effects on the payoff
at higher values of decoherence. Furthermore, amplitude damping and generalized
amplitude damping channels have almost comparable effects at lower level of

seems to become much less common for large kissing configurations in higher

at these interfaces that happens to exist even in the absence of structure and
bulk inversion asymmetry within each subsystem (i.e. the QW and the metal).
Thus, this is a pure boundary spin Hall effect which can be directly related to
the existence of exponentially localized edge states at the interface. We
demonstrate how this effect can be measured and functionalized for an
all-electric spin injection into normal metal leads.

preserve the unitarity of time-propagation. The absence of commutators or other

absorbed power law and iron line. Cut-off power laws and Compton reflection
from cold matter did not provide a better description. For the 2009 January
observation, we set a lower limit on the cut-off energy at over 2 MeV. The
power spectral density function was generated from RXTE/ASM and PCA data, as
well as an XMM-Newton long look, and clear evidence for a break at 18+10-7 days

Lx/LEdd, the break was a factor of 17+/-9 times higher than the break frequency
predicted by the McHardy and co-workers' relation, which was empirically
derived for a sample of objects, which are radio-quiet and accreting at
relatively high values of Lbol/LEdd. We have interpreted our observations in
the context of a clumpy molecular torus. The variability characteristics and
the broadband spectral energy distribution, when compared to Seyferts, imply
that the bright hard X-ray continuum emission may originate at the base of the

sensing (CS), a receive node compresses its received signal via a linear
transformation, referred to as measurement matrix. The samples are subsequently
forwarded to a fusion center, where an L1-optimization problem is formulated
and solved for target information. CS-based MIMO radar exploits the target
sparsity in the angle-Doppler-range space and thus achieves the high
localization performance of traditional MIMO radar but with many fewer
measurements. The measurement matrix is vital for CS recovery performance. This
paper considers the design of measurement matrices that achieve an optimality
criterion that depends on the coherence of the sensing matrix (CSM) and/or
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). The first approach minimizes a performance
penalty that is a linear combination of CSM and the inverse SIR. The second one
imposes a structure on the measurement matrix and determines the parameters
involved so that the SIR is enhanced. Depending on the transmit waveforms, the
second approach can significantly improve SIR, while maintaining CSM comparable
to that of the Gaussian random measurement matrix (GRMM). Simulations indicate
that the proposed measurement matrices can improve detection accuracy as
compared to a GRMM.

`radio mode' AGN activity and subsequently stripped from the galaxy due to its
relative southward motion. Because this X-ray gas has been removed from the

allows one to construct functorial mappings from knots to knots, to refine many
invariants and to prove minimality theorems for knots. In the present paper, we
generalise the notion of parity and construct parities with coefficients from
an abelian group rather than $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and investigate them for different
knot theories. For some knot theories we show that there is the universal
parity, i.e.\ such a parity that any other parity factors through it. We
realise that in the case of flat knots all parities originate from homology
groups of underlying surfaces and, at the same time, allow one to ""localise""
the global homological information about the ambient space at crossings.
  We prove that there is only one non-trivial parity for free knots, the
Gaussian parity. At the end of the paper we analyse the behaviour of some

prevalence in nature and our daily lives [1, 2]. A critical property of a
network is its resilience to random breakdown and failure [3-6], typically
studied as a percolation problem [7-9] or by modeling cascading failures
[10-12]. Many complex systems, from power grids and the Internet to the brain
and society [13-15], can be modeled using modular networks comprised of small,
densely connected groups of nodes [16, 17]. These modules often overlap, with
network elements belonging to multiple modules [18, 19]. Yet existing work on
robustness has not considered the role of overlapping, modular structure. Here
we study the robustness of these systems to the failure of elements. We show
analytically and empirically that it is possible for the modules themselves to
become uncoupled or non-overlapping well before the network disintegrates. If
overlapping modular organization plays a role in overall functionality,
networks may be far more vulnerable than predicted by conventional percolation
theory.

cluster Abell 383 and detected in new Hubble Space Telescope ACS and WFC3
imaging, as well as in Warm Spitzer observations. This galaxy was selected as a
pair of i-dropouts; its suspected high redshift was confirmed by the
measurement of a strong Lyman-alpha line in both images using Keck/DEIMOS.
Combining Hubble and Spitzer photometry after correcting for contamination by
line emission (estimated to be a small effect), we identify a strong Balmer
break of 1.5 magnitudes. Taking into account the magnification factor of
11.4+/-1.9 (2.65+/-0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the unlensed AB magnitude
for the source is 27.2+/-0.05 in the H band, corresponding to a 0.4 L* galaxy,
and 25.7+/-0.08 at 3.6 um. The UV slope is consistent with beta~2.0, and from
the rest-frame UV continuum we measure a current star formation rate of
2.4+/-1.1 Msol/yr. The unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc,
from which we deduce a star-forming surface density of ~10 Msol/yr/kpc2. The
Lyman-alpha emission is found to be extended over ~3"" along the slit,
corresponding to ~5 kpc in the source plane. This can be explained by the
presence of a much larger envelope of neutral hydrogen around the star-forming
region. Finally, fitting the spectral energy distribution using 7 photometric
data points with simple SED models, we derive the following properties: very
little reddening, an inferred stellar mass of M*=6e9 Msol, and an inferred age
of ~800 Myrs (corresponding to a redshift of formation of ~18). The
star-formation rate of this object was likely much stronger in the past than at
the time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a fraction of
galaxies at z~6 which have already faded in rest-frame UV wavelengths.

angular momentum in accretion disks, allowing material to fall onto the central
object. Previous work has established that the MRI can drive a mean-field
dynamo, possibly leading to a self-sustaining accretion system. Recently,
however, simulations of the scaling of the angular momentum transport parameter
$\alphaSS$ with the magnetic Prandtl number $\Prandtl$ have cast doubt on the
ability of the MRI to transport astrophysically relevant amounts of angular
momentum in real disk systems. Here, we use simulations including explicit
physical viscosity and resistivity to show that when vertical stratification is
included, mean field dynamo action operates, driving the system to a
configuration in which the magnetic field is not fully helical. This relaxes
the constraints on the generated field provided by magnetic helicity
conservation, allowing the generation of a mean field on timescales independent
of the resistivity. Our models demonstrate the existence of a critical magnetic
Reynolds number $\Rmagc$, below which transport becomes strongly
$\Prandtl$-dependent and chaotic, but above which the transport is steady and
$\Prandtl$-independent. Prior simulations showing $\Prandtl$-dependence had
$\Rmag < \Rmagc$. We conjecture that this steady regime is possible because the
mean field dynamo is not helicity-limited and thus does not depend on the
details of the helicity ejection process. Scaling to realistic astrophysical
parameters suggests that disks around both protostars and stellar mass black
holes have $\Rmag >> \Rmagc$. Thus, we suggest that the strong $\Prandtl$
dependence seen in recent simulations does not occur in real systems.

make pulsars accessible to other sub-disciplines of astronomy and physics. A
realistic and accurate determination of these two derived parameters play an
important role in understanding of advanced stages of stellar evolution and the
physics that govern relevant processes. Here I summarize new constraints on the
ages and masses of NSs with an evolutionary perspective. I show that the
observed P-Pdot demographics is more diverse than what is theoretically
predicted for the standard evolutionary channel. In particular, standard
recycling followed by dipole spin-down fails to reproduce the population of
millisecond pulsars with higher magnetic fields (B > 4 x 10^{8} G) at rates
deduced from observations. A proper inclusion of constraints arising from
binary evolution and mass accretion offers a more realistic insight into the
age distribution. By analytically implementing these constraints, I propose a
""modified"" spin-down age for millisecond pulsars that gives estimates closer to
the true age. Finally, I independently analyze the peak, skewness and cutoff
values of the underlying mass distribution from a comprehensive list of radio
pulsars for which secure mass measurements are available. The inferred mass
distribution shows clear peaks at 1.35 Msun and 1.50 Msun for NSs in double
neutron star (DNS) and neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) systems respectively. I
find a mass cutoff at 2 Msun for NSs with WD companions, which establishes a
firm lower bound for the maximum mass of NSs.

distinct characteristics: the spectrum is significantly harder than emission
elsewhere in the Galaxy and the morphology is elongated in latitude with
respect to longitude with an axis ratio ~2. If these electrons are generated
through annihilations of dark matter particles in the Galactic halo, this
morphology is difficult to realize with a standard spherical halo and isotropic
cosmic-ray diffusion. However, we show that anisotropic diffusion along ordered
magnetic field lines towards the center of the Galaxy coupled with a prolate

unrealistic assumptions about diffusion parameters. Furthermore, a Sommerfeld
enhancement to the self annihilation cross-section of ~30 yields a good fit to

cosmological horizon and two, one or no black hole horizons, while negative

the non-singular core and thermodynamic stability in the final phase of the

consistent with the observed abundance of giant arcs in clusters. While
previous theoretical studies have focused on properties of the lens and source
populations, as well as cosmological effects such as dark energy, the impact of
initial conditions on the giant-arc abundance is relatively unexplored. Here,
we quantify the impact of non-Gaussian initial conditions with the local
bispectrum shape on the predicted frequency of giant arcs. Using a
path-integral formulation of the excursion set formalism, we extend a
semi-analytic model for calculating halo concentrations to the case of
primordial non-Gaussianity, which may be useful for applications outside of
this work. We find that massive halos tend to collapse earlier in models with
positive f_NL, relative to the Gaussian case, leading to enhanced concentration
parameters. The converse is true for f_NL < 0. In addition to these effects,
which change the lensing cross sections, non-Gaussianity also modifies the
abundance of supercritical clusters available for lensing. These combined
effects work together to either enhance (f_NL > 0) or suppress (f_NL < 0) the
probability of giant-arc formation. Using the best value and 95% confidence
levels currently available from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, we
find that the giant-arc optical depth for sources at z_s~2 is enhanced by ~20%

suppression of ~5% for f_NL = -10. These differences translate to similar

accreting from hydrostatic giant-like envelopes of gas, formed from the

occurs after a few million years of evolution. We show that the mechanism which

work shows that there is indirect evidence of gas inflow from 3 kpc down to
small radii: a large-scale stellar bar, a prominent starburst ring (r~580 pc)
and a LINER/Seyfert 2 nucleus. In this paper we study the gas kinematics as
traced by the CO line emission in detail. We quantify the influence of the
large-scale stellar bar by constructing an analytical model of the evolution of
gas particles in a barred potential. From this model gravitational torques and
mass accumulation rates are computed. We compare our model-based gravitational
torque results with previous observationally-based ones. The model also shows
that the large-scale stellar bar is indeed the dominant force for driving the
gas inward, to the starburst ring. Inside the ring itself a nuclear stellar
oval might play an important role. Detailed analysis of the CO gas kinematics
there shows that emission arises from two co-spatial, but kinematically
distinct components at several locations. The main emission component can
always be related to the overall bar-driven gas kinematics. The second
component exhibits velocities that are larger than expected for gas on stable
orbits, has a molecular gas mass of 1.8x10^6Msun, is very likely connected to
the nuclear stellar oval, and is consistent with inflowing motion towards the
very center. This may form the last link in the chain of gas inflow towards the
active galactic nucleus in NGC 6951.

to satisfy (fully or partially), by buying a subset of items at minimum cost.
For example, in the k-MST problem we want to find the cheapest tree spanning at
least k nodes of an edge-weighted graph. Here nodes and edges represent
requests and items, respectively.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of a new family of multi-layer covering
problems. Each such problem consists of a collection of h distinct instances of
a standard covering problem (layers), with the constraint that all layers share
the same set of requests. We identify two main subfamilies of these problems: -
in a union multi-layer problem, a request is satisfied if it is satisfied in at
least one layer; - in an intersection multi-layer problem, a request is
satisfied if it is satisfied in all layers. To see some natural applications,
consider both generalizations of k-MST. Union k-MST can model a problem where
we are asked to connect a set of users to at least one of two communication
networks, e.g., a wireless and a wired network. On the other hand, intersection
k-MST can formalize the problem of connecting a subset of users to both
electricity and water.
  We present a number of hardness and approximation results for union and
intersection versions of several standard optimization problems: MST, Steiner
tree, set cover, facility location, TSP, and their partial covering variants.

each input bit is transformed in one of the following ways: it is deleted with
probability d, or an extra bit is added after it with probability i, or it is
transmitted unmodified with probability 1-d-i. A computable lower bound on the
capacity of this channel is derived. The transformation of the input sequence
by the channel may be viewed in terms of runs as follows: some runs of the
input sequence get shorter/longer, some runs get deleted, and some new runs are
added. It is difficult for the decoder to synchronize the channel output
sequence to the transmitted codeword mainly due to deleted runs and new
inserted runs.
  The main idea is a mutual information decomposition in terms of the rate
achieved by a sub-optimal decoder that determines the positions of the deleted
and inserted runs in addition to decoding the transmitted codeword. The mutual
information between the channel input and output sequences is expressed as the
sum of the rate achieved by this decoder and the rate loss due to its
sub-optimality. Obtaining computable lower bounds on each of these quantities
yields a lower bound on the capacity. The bounds proposed in this paper provide
the first characterization of achievable rates for channels with general
insertions, and for channels with both deletions and insertions. For the
special case of the deletion channel, the proposed bound improves on the
previous best lower bound for deletion probabilities up to 0.3.

based on the assumption of the absence of airflow around icicles. In this

Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft reveal that dusty
features such as the F ring and the ringlets in the Encke and the Laplace Gaps
have distinctive infrared transmission spectra. These spectra show a narrow
optical depth minimum at wavelengths around 2.87 microns. This minimum is
likely due to the Christiansen Effect, a reduction in the extinction of small
particles when their (complex) refractive index is close to that of the
surrounding medium. Simple Mie-scattering models demonstrate that the strength
of this opacity dip is sensitive to the size distribution of particles between
1 and 100 microns across. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of the
occultation data is sufficient to reveal variations in the transmission spectra
within and among these rings. For example, in both the Encke Gap ringlets and F
ring, the opacity dip weakens with increasing local optical depth, which is
consistent with the larger particles being concentrated near the cores of these
rings. The strength of the opacity dip varies most dramatically within the F
ring; certain compact regions of enhanced optical depth lack an opacity dip and
therefore appear to have a greatly reduced fraction of grains in the few-micron
size range.Such spectrally-identifiable structures probably represent a subset
of the compact optically-thick clumps observed by other Cassini instruments.
These variations in the ring's particle size distribution can provide new
insights into the processes of grain aggregation, disruption and transport
within dusty rings. For example, the unusual spectral properties of the F-ring
clumps could perhaps be ascribed to small grains adhering onto the surface of
larger particles in regions of anomalously low velocity dispersion.

the levels of contamination by both Galactic and extragalactic X-ray sources
unrelated to a star-forming region under study. For Galactic contaminations, we
consider contribution from main-sequence stars and giants (not including
cataclysmic variables and other classes of accretion-driven X-ray binary
systems) as they make the dominant contribution at the position of the Carina
Nebula. The simulations take into consideration a variety of technical factors
involving a Galactic population synthesis model, stellar X-ray luminosity
functions, Chandra telescope response, source detection methodology, and
possible spatial variations in the X-ray background and absorption through
molecular clouds. When applied to the 1.42 square-degree field of the Chandra
Carina Complex Project (CCCP), the simulations predict ~5000 contaminating
sources (1 source per square arcminute of the survey), evenly distributed
across the field. The results of the simulations are further employed in a
companion CCCP study to assign membership probabilities to individual sources.

in the inspiral phase of the numerical relativity simulation must be controlled
to less than about 0.1rad. (These numbers apply to moderately optimistic
estimates about the number of GW sources; exceptionally strong signals require
even smaller errors.) The dominant source of error arises from the inaccuracy

performed significantly before the start of the longest currently available

AGN contribution to the optical and infrared emission. Using this selection, we
identified different behaviours of AGN-dominated and host-dominated sources in

dominated sources show a clear trend in the f_x/f_R vs. R-K and f_24um/f_R vs.
R-K diagrams, while the hosts follow the behaviour of non X-ray detected
galaxies. In the optical-near-infrared colour-magnitude diagram we see that the
known trend of redder objects being more obscured in X-rays is stronger for
AGN-dominated than for host-dominated systems. This is an indication that the
trend is more related to the AGN contaminating the overall colours than any
evolutionary effects. Finally, we find that a significant fraction (~30%) of
the reddest AGN are not obscured in X-rays.

droplets on a surface from the elongation of their impact profiles. However,
the lack of velocity information makes finding the height of the origin from
the impact position and angle of individual drops not possible. From aggregate
statistics of the spatter and basic equations of projectile motion, we
introduce a reciprocal correlation plot that is effective when the polar launch
angle is concentrated in a narrow range. The vertical coordinate depends on the
orientation of the spattered surface, and equals the tangent of the impact
angle for a level surface. When the horizontal plot coordinate is twice the
reciprocal of the impact distance, we can infer the source height as the slope
of the data points in the reciprocal correlation plot. If the distribution of
launch angles is not narrow, failure of the method is evident in the lack of
linear correlation. We perform a number of experimental trials, as well as
numerical calculations and show that the height estimate is insensitive to
aerodynamic drag. Besides its possible relevance for crime investigation,
reciprocal-plot analysis of spatter may find application to volcanism and other
topics and is most immediately applicable for undergraduate science and

found to operate in highly idealized numerical experiments. Numerical
simulations are used to test for the presence and quantitative effect of the

Comparisons between cases where lifted dust is radiatively active and
radiatively passive elucidate the importance of the dust radiative forcing on
the thermodynamic and kinematic structure of the atmosphere. The WEIRD feedback
mechanism does operate under realistic conditions, although it can be masked
and diminished by a variety of other forcing mechanisms. Globally increased
dust loading is found to accelerate the local winds while simultaneously
diminishing the impact of local physiographical forcing. Local enhancements of
dust produce a thermal and dynamical response that resembles many of the
essential features seen in the idealized experiments. The development of a warm
core low, rotational wind tendencies and convergence boundaries intersecting at
the center of the strongest dust storms are consistent with WEIRD. Local and
regional storms are effective at producing elevated dust layers above the
boundary layer aided by the radiative forcing of the dust. Ubiquitous and
persistent thermal circulations associated with topography can also inject dust
into the free atmosphere above the planetary boundary layer, but they are less
efficient than the dust storms. High concentrations of dust in the lowest
levels of the atmosphere produce a significant and dramatic heating of the
ground and the near-surface air despite greatly reduced insolation at the

flexible summaries which naturally support subset-sum queries with unbiased

  Classic sample-based summaries, however, are designed for arbitrary subset
queries and are oblivious to the structure in the set of keys. The particular
structure, such as hierarchy, order, or product space (multi-dimensional),
makes range queries much more relevant for most analysis of the data.
  Dedicated summarization algorithms for range-sum queries have also been
extensively studied. They can outperform existing sampling schemes in terms of
accuracy on range queries per summary size. Their accuracy, however, rapidly
degrades when, as is often the case, the query spans multiple ranges. They are
also less flexible - being targeted for range sum queries alone - and are often
quite costly to build and use.
  In this paper we propose and evaluate variance optimal sampling schemes that

$\sigma_k$. In this paper, for the rainbow connection number we prove that if

next-to-leading order radiative corrections at ${\cal{O}}(\alpha_s^3)$, and
nuclear effects like shadowing and parton energy loss are included. The parton
energy loss is implemented in a simple multiple scattering model, where the
partons lose an energy $\epsilon=\lambda \times dE/dx$ per collision, where
$\lambda$ is their mean free path. We take $\epsilon=\kappa E$ for a treatment
which is suggestive of the Bethe Heitler (BH) mechanism of incoherent
scatterings, $\epsilon = \sqrt{\alpha E}$ for LPM mechanism, and $\epsilon=$
constant for a mechanism which suggests that the rate of energy loss ($dE/dx$)
of the partons is proportional to total path length ($L$) of the parton in the
plasma, as the formation time of the radiated gluon becomes much larger than
$L$.
  We find that while the BH mechanism describes the nuclear modification factor
$R_{\textrm{AA}}$ for $p_T \leq$ 5 GeV/$c$ (especially at RHIC energy), the LPM
and more so the constant $dE/dx$ mechanism provides a good description at
larger $p_T$. This confirms the earlier expectation that the energy loss
mechanism for partons changes from BH to LPM for $p_T \ge \lambda <k_T^2>$,
where $\lambda \approx$ 1 fm and $<k_T^2> \approx$ 1 GeV$^2$ is the average

Reynolds numbers is generally associated with the instability of the laminar
flow. On the other hand, since the turbulent flow characteristically appears in
the form of spatially localized structures (e.g., eddies) filling the flow
field, a tendency to occupy such a structured state of the flow cannot be ruled
out as a driving force for turbulent transition. To examine this possibility,
we propose a simple analytical model that treats the flow as a collection of
localized spatial structures, each of which consists of elementary cells in
which the behavior of the particles (atoms or molecules) is uncorrelated. This
allows us to introduce the Reynolds number, associating it with the ratio
between the total phase volume for the system and that for the elementary cell.
Using the principle of maximum entropy to calculate the most probable size
distribution of the localized structures, we show that as the Reynolds number
increases, the elementary cells group into the localized structures, which
successfully explains turbulent transition and some other general properties of
turbulent flows. We show that the basic assumptions underlying the model, i.e.
that the particles are indistinguishable and elementary volumes of phase space
exist in which the state of the particles is uncertain, are involved in the
derivation of the Navier-Stokes equation. Taking into account that the model
captures essential features of turbulent flows, this suggests that the driving
force for the turbulent transition is basically the same as in the present
model, i.e. the tendency of the system to occupy a statistically dominant state
plays a key role. The instability of the flow at high Reynolds numbers can then
be a mechanism to initiate structural rearrangement of the flow to find this
state.

  A formal statistical framework is presented for estimating and forecasting
randomness in sunspot numbers on top of deterministic (including chaotic)
models for solar cycles. The Fokker-Planck approach formulated assumes a
specified long-term or secular variation in sunspot number over an underlying
solar cycle via a driver function. The model then describes the observed
randomness in sunspot number on top of this driver function. We consider a
simple harmonic choice for the driver function, but the approach is general and
can easily be extended to include other drivers which account for underlying
physical processes and/or empirical features of the sunspot numbers. The
framework is consistent during both solar maximum and minimum, and requires no
parameter restrictions to ensure non-negative sunspot numbers. Model parameters
are estimated using statistically optimal techniques. The model agrees both
qualitatively and quantitatively with monthly sunspot data even with the
simplistic representation of the periodic solar cycle. This framework should be
particularly useful for solar cycle forecasters and is complementary to
existing modeling techniques. An analytic approximation for the Fokker-Planck
equation is presented, which is analogous to the Euler approximation, which

find a new mechanism for the excitation of longitudinal slow modes within

immediate surroundings of magnetic elements are responsible for the excitation
of slow modes. The coupling between the external downdraft and the plasma
motion internal to the flux concentration is mediated by the inertial forces of
the downdraft that act on the magnetic flux concentration. These forces, in
conjunction with the downward movement, pump the internal atmosphere in the
downward direction, which entails a fast downdraft in the photospheric and
chromospheric layers of the magnetic element. Subsequent to the transient
pumping phase, the atmosphere rebounds, causing a slow mode traveling along the
magnetic flux concentration in the upward direction. It develops into a shock
wave in chromospheric heights, possibly capable of producing some kind of
dynamic fibril. We propose an observational detection of this process.

type: csin(2\omega x+d)/(x+1). It is known that the continuous spectrum of the
operator L_{\alpha} has the same band-gap structure as the free periodic
operator, whereas in each band of the absolutely continuous spectrum there
exist two points (so-called critical or resonance) where the operator
L_{\alpha} has a subordinate solution, which can be either an eigenvalue or a
`half-bound' state. The phenomenon of an embedded eigenvalue is unstable under
the change of the boundary condition as well as under the local change of the
potential, in other words, it is not generic. We prove that in the general case
the spectral density of the operator L_{\alpha} has power-like zeroes at
critical points (i.e., the absolutely continuous spectrum has pseudogaps). This
phenomenon is stable in the above-mentioned sense.

which include a functional predictor. The analog of the regression parameter

If, in addition, one has scalar predictors, as is often the case in
applications to longitudinal studies, the question arises how to incorporate
these into a functional regression model. We study a varying-coefficient
approach where the scalar covariates are modeled as additional arguments of the
regression parameter function. This extension of the functional linear
regression model is analogous to the extension of conventional linear
regression models to varying-coefficient models and shares its advantages, such
as increased flexibility; however, the details of this extension are more
challenging in the functional case. Our methodology combines smoothing methods
with regularization by truncation at a finite number of functional principal
components. A practical version is developed and is shown to perform better
than functional linear regression for longitudinal data. We investigate the
asymptotic properties of varying-coefficient functional linear regression and
establish consistency properties.

opinions in a closed society, where the interactions favour groups of agreeing

the original model used only linear chains, it has since been adapted to
general networks. This model has a very rich transient, that has been used to
model several aspects of elections, but its stationary states are always
consensus states. In order to model more complex behaviours we have, in a
recent work, introduced the idea of biases and prejudices to the Sznajd model,
by generalizing the bounded confidence rule that is common to many continuous
opinion models. In that work we have found that the mean-field version of this
model (corresponding to a complete network) allows for stationary states where
non-interacting opinions survive, but never for the coexistence of interacting
opinions. In the present work, we provide networks that allow for the
coexistence of interacting opinions. Moreover, we show that the model does not
become inactive, that is, the opinions keep changing, even in the stationary
regime. We also provide results that give some insights on how this behaviour
approaches the mean-field behaviour, as the networks are changed.

galaxies in the high energy gamma-ray domain, as well as radio-loud narrow-line
Seyfert 1 objects, which were previously unusual extragalactic suspects for
high energy emission. Motivated by the presence of sources close to the
location of composite starburst/Seyfert 2 galaxies in the first year Fermi/LAT
catalogue, we studied high energy gamma-ray emission from such objects, aiming
at disentangling the emission of starburst and Seyfert activity. We analysed
1.6 years of Fermi/LAT data from NGC 1068 and NGC 4945, which count among the
brightest Seyfert 2 galaxies. We found an excess of high energy gamma-rays of
8.3 sigmas and 9.2 sigmas for 1FGL J0242.7+0007 and 1FGL J1305.4-4928, which
are found to be consistent with the position of the Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 1068
and NGC 4945, respectively. While the high energy flux of NGC 4945 is
consistent with starburst activity, that of NGC 1068 is an order of magnitude
above expectations, suggesting dominant emission from the active nucleus. We
show that a leptonic scenario can account for the multi-wavelength spectral
energy distribution of NGC 1068. High energy gamma-ray emission is thus
revealed for the first time in a Seyfert 2 galaxy. If this result is confirmed
in other objects, new perspectives would be opened up into the GeV band, with
the discovery of a new class of high energy gamma-ray emitters.

self-gravitating clouds should be convolutions of the local log-normal PDF,
which depends on the local average density rho-ave and Mach number M, and the
probability distribution functions for rho-ave and M, which depend on the
overall cloud structure. When self-gravity drives a cloud to increased central
density, the total PDF develops an extended tail. If there is a critical
density or column density for star formation, then the fraction of the local
mass exceeding this threshold becomes higher near the cloud center. These
elements of cloud structure should be in place before significant star
formation begins. Then the efficiency is high so that bound clusters form
rapidly, and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) has an imprint in the gas
before destructive radiation from young stars can erase it. The IMF could arise
from a power-law distribution of mass for cloud structure. These structures
should form stars down to the thermal Jeans mass MJ at each density in excess
of a threshold. The high-density tail of the PDF, combined with additional
fragmentation in each star-forming core, extends the IMF into the Brown Dwarf
regime. The core fragmentation process is distinct from the cloud structuring
process and introduces an independen core fragmentation mass function (CFMF).
The CFMF would show up primarily below the IMF peak.

(R~0.9) which together with the relatively strong neutral Fe Kalpha emission
line (EW ~ 100 eV) strongly supports a scenario where a Compton-thick mirror is
present. The primary X-ray continuum is strongly obscured by an absorber with a
column density of NH =2-3 x10^{23} cm^{-2}. Two possible scenarios are proposed
for the absorber: a neutral partial covering or a mildly ionised absorber with
an ionisation parameter log\xi ~ 1.0 erg cm s^{-1}. A comparison with the past

V838 Mon is an eruptive variable, which exploded in 2002. It
displayed the most spectacular light echo ever observed. However, neither the

detected in the field of the light echo. In particular, we explore its
connection to the echoing dust around V838 Mon. Methods. We observed the echo
region in multiple CO rotational transitions. We present and analyse maps of
the region obtained in the 12CO(1-0) and (3-2) lines. In addition, deep spectra
at several positions were acquired in 12CO(1-0), (2-1), (3-2), and 13CO(1-0),
(2-1). Radiative transfer modelling of line intensities is performed for chosen
positions to constrain the kinetic temperatures and densities. We derive global
parameters (e.g. mass, distance, total column density) of the emitting cloud.
Results. We found that a compact molecular cloud is located within the echo
region. The molecular emission is physically connected to the dusty environment
seen in the optical echo and they both belong to the same translucent cloud.
The interstellar nature of the cloud is confirmed by its high mass of 90-150
Msun. We propose that the cloud consists of material remaining after the
formation of the cluster to which V838 Mon belongs. This indicates that the
eruptive star has young age (3-10 Myr).

Subdivision algorithms based on algebraic techniques (e.g., Sturm or Descartes

In this paper, we consider a simple subdivision algorithm whose primitives are
purely numerical (e.g., function evaluation). The complexity of this algorithm
is adaptive because the algorithm makes decisions based on local data. The
complexity analysis of adaptive algorithms (and this algorithm in particular)
is a new challenge for computer science. In this paper, we compute the size of
the subdivision tree for the SqFreeEVAL algorithm.
  The SqFreeEVAL algorithm is an evaluation-based numerical algorithm which is
well-known in several communities. The algorithm itself is simple, but prior
attempts to compute its complexity have proven to be quite technical and have
yielded sub-optimal results. Our main result is a simple O(d(L+ln d)) bound on
the size of the subdivision tree for the SqFreeEVAL algorithm on the benchmark
problem of isolating all real roots of an integer polynomial f of degree d and
whose coefficients can be written with at most L bits.

amortization technique of the standard Mahler-Davenport root bounds to
interpret the integral in terms of d and L. Second, we use a continuous
amortization technique based on an integral to bound the size of the
subdivision tree. This paper is the first to use the novel analysis technique

to cover large (octave) fractional bandwidths for sensitivity and spectral
flexibility, which makes the design of good analogue circular polarizers
challenging. Better polarization purity requires a flatter phase response over
increasingly wide bandwidth, which is most easily achieved with digital
techniques. They offer the ability to form circular polarization with perfect
polarization purity over arbitrarily wide fractional bandwidths, due to the
ease of introducing a perfect quadrature phase shift. Further, the rapid
improvements in field programmable gate arrays provide the high processing
power, low cost, portability and reconfigurability needed to make practical the
implementation of the formation of circular polarization digitally. Aims: Here
we explore the performance of a circular polarizer implemented with digital
techniques. Methods: We designed a digital circular polarizer in which the
intermediate frequency signals from a receiver with native linear polarizations
were sampled and converted to circular polarization. The frequency-dependent
instrumental phase difference and gain scaling factors were determined using an
injected noise signal and applied to the two linear polarizations to equalize
the transfer characteristics of the two polarization channels. This
equalization was performed in 512 frequency channels over a 512 MHz bandwidth.
Circular polarization was formed by quadrature phase shifting and summing the
equalized linear polarization signals. Results: We obtained polarization purity
of -25 dB corresponding to a D-term of 0.06 over the whole bandwidth.
Conclusions: This technique enables construction of broad-band radio astronomy
receivers with native linear polarization to form circular polarization for
VLBI.

  for Turbo Codes","Submitted to IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An interleaver is a critical component for the channel coding performance of
turbo codes. Algebraic constructions are of particular interest because they
admit analytical designs and simple, practical hardware implementation. Also,
the recently proposed quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) based interleavers
by Sun and Takeshita (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Jan. 2005) provide excellent
performance for short-to-medium block lengths, and have been selected for the
3GPP LTE standard. In this work, we derive some upper bounds on the best
achievable minimum distance dmin of QPP-based conventional binary turbo codes
(with tailbiting termination, or dual termination when the interleaver length N
is sufficiently large) that are tight for larger block sizes. In particular, we
show that the minimum distance is at most 2(2^{\nu +1}+9), independent of the
interleaver length, when the QPP has a QPP inverse, where {\nu} is the degree
of the primitive feedback and monic feedforward polynomials. However, allowing
the QPP to have a larger degree inverse may give strictly larger minimum
distances (and lower multiplicities). In particular, we provide several QPPs
with an inverse degree of at least three for some of the 3GPP LTE interleaver
lengths giving a dmin with the 3GPP LTE constituent encoders which is strictly
larger than 50. For instance, we have found a QPP for N=6016 which gives an
estimated dmin of 57. Furthermore, we provide the exact minimum distance and
the corresponding multiplicity for all 3GPP LTE turbo codes (with dual
termination) which shows that the best minimum distance is 51. Finally, we
compute the best achievable minimum distance with QPP interleavers for all 3GPP
LTE interleaver lengths N <= 4096, and compare the minimum distance with the
one we get when using the 3GPP LTE polynomials.

relating vacuum stability to the UV behavior of spectra and interactions.
Infrared finiteness at all genera in perturbation theory can be rephrased in
terms of cancelations involving only tree-level closed strings scattering
amplitudes. This provides quantitative results on the allowed deviations from
supersymmetry on perturbative stable vacua. From a mathematical perspective,
diagrammatic relations involving closed string amplitudes suggest a relevance
of unipotent flows dynamics for the Schottky problem and for the construction
of the superstring measure.

  Lebzelter T. and B. Wing eds, ASP Conf. Series",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is commonly believed that winds of cool giants in their late evolutionary
stages are driven by radiative pressure on dust grains, but the actual grain
species responsible for driving winds of M-type AGB stars are still a matter of
debate (see H\""ofner, this volume). The optical properties of the dust
particles responsible for initiating the outflow affect the stellar spectra in
two ways: (i) indirectly, through their influence on the dynamical structure of
the atmosphere/envelope and the resulting molecular features, and (ii)
directly, by changes of the spectral energy distribution due to absorption and
scattering on dust grains. The qualitative differences in the energy
distributions of C-type and M-type AGB stars in the visual and near-infrared
regions suggest that the dust particles in oxygen rich atmospheres are
relatively transparent to radiation. By using detailed dynamical models of gas
and radiation combined with a simple description for the dust opacity (which
can be adjusted to mimic different wavelength dependencies and condensation
temperatures) and also by adjusting the fraction of the opacity that is treated
as true absorption, we investigate which dust properties produce synthetic
photometry consistent with observations. The goal of this study is to narrow
down the possible dust species that may be driving the winds in M-type AGB
stars.

dwarf galaxies, which can be unscreened for values of the parameters not yet
ruled out observationally, we show that the cumulative effect of their
increased luminosity can enhance the total galactic luminosity. We estimate
this enhancement and find that it can be considerable given model parameters
that are still under experimental scrutiny. By looking for systematic offsets
between screened dwarf galaxies in clusters and unscreened galaxies in voids,
these effects could form the basis of an independent observational test that
can potentially lower the current experimental bounds on the model independent
parameters of these theories by and order of magnitude or more.

on views, in the most general framework of a database integration/exchange.
Developed database category DB, for databases (objects) and view-based mappings
(morphisms) between them, is different from Set category: the morphisms (based
on a set of complex query computations) are not functions, while the objects
are database instances (sets of relations). The logic based schema mappings
between databases, usually written in a highly expressive logical language (ex.
LAV, GAV, GLAV mappings, or tuple generating dependency) may be functorially
translated into this ""computation"" category DB. A new approach is adopted,
based on the behavioral point of view for databases, and behavioral
equivalences for databases and their mappings are established. By introduction
of view-based observations for databases, which are computations without
side-effects, we define a fundamental (Universal algebra) monad with a
power-view endofunctor T. The resulting 2-category DB is symmetric, so that any
mapping can be represented as an object (database instance) as well, where a
higher-level mapping between mappings is a 2-cell morphism. Database category
DB has the following properties: it is equal to its dual, complete and
cocomplete. Special attention is devoted to practical examples: a query
definition, a query rewriting in GAV Database-integration environment, and the
fixpoint solution of a canonical data integration model.
