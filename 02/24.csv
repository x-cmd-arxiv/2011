thresholds of 3-dimensional turbo codes (3D-TCs), recently introduced by Berrou
et al.. Here, we consider binary 3D-TCs while the original work of Berrou et
al. considered double-binary codes. In the first part of the paper, the minimum
distance properties are analyzed from an ensemble perspective, both in the
finite-length regime and in the asymptotic case of large block lengths. In
particular, we analyze the asymptotic weight distribution of 3D-TCs and show
numerically that their typical minimum distance dmin may, depending on the
specific parameters, asymptotically grow linearly with the block length, i.e.,
the 3D-TC ensemble is asymptotically good for some parameters. In the second
part of the paper, we derive some useful upper bounds on the dmin when using
quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) interleavers with a quadratic inverse.
Furthermore, we give examples of interleaver lengths where an upper bound
appears to be tight. The best codes (in terms of estimated dmin) obtained by
randomly searching for good pairs of QPPs for use in the 3D-TC are compared to
a probabilistic lower bound on the dmin when selecting codes from the 3D-TC
ensemble uniformly at random. This comparison shows that the use of designed
QPP interleavers can improve the dmin significantly. For instance, we have
found a (6144,2040) 3D-TC with an estimated dmin of 147, while the
probabilistic lower bound is 69. Higher rates are obtained by puncturing
nonsystematic bits, and optimized periodic puncturing patterns for rates 1/2,
2/3, and 4/5 are found by computer search. Finally, we give iterative decoding
thresholds, computed from an extrinsic information transfer chart analysis, and
present simulation results on the additive white Gaussian noise channel to
compare the error rate performance to that of conventional turbo codes.

Poincar\'e duality holds between the ordinary rational cohomology groups of the

these intersection spaces defines a cohomology theory HI for singular spaces,

description of the theory HI by a complex of global smooth differential forms

that a concomitant structural transition from tetragonal I4/mmm to orthorhombic
Cmcm phases drives this electronic transition. A detailed symmetry-mode
analysis reveals that condensation of three soft modes -Delta_2(B2u), X1+(B2u)
and X1+(A)- acting on the oxygen atoms accounts for the structural
transformation. The Delta_2 mode leads to a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion (in
the orthorhombic bc-plane only) on one Mn site (Mn1) whereas the two X1+ modes
produce an overall contraction of the other Mn site (Mn2) and expansion of the
Mn1 one. The X1+ modes are responsible for the tetragonal superlattice
(1/2,1/2,0)-type reflections in agreement with a checkerboard ordering of two
different Mn sites. A strong enhancement of the scattered intensity has been
observed for these superlattice reflections close to the Mn K edge, which could
be ascribed to some degree of charge disproportion between the two Mn sites of
about 0.15 electrons. We also found that the local geometrical anisotropy of
the Mn1 atoms and its ordering originated by the condensed Delta_2 mode alone
perfectly explains the resonant scattering of forbidden (1/4,1/4,0)-type
reflections without invoking any orbital ordering.

peaks appear in the precessional regime, their shape and position shifting with

a distinct correlation between the curvature of the DW and the twist of the

phenomenological description of this twist with a four-coordinate DW

charmonium states $J/\psi$, $\psi(3686)$ and $\psi(3770)$ in the isospin
asymmetric strange hadronic matter at finite temperatures and investigate the
possibility of the decay of the charmonium states into $D\bar D$ pairs in the
hot hadronic medium. The mass modifications of these charmonium states arise
due to their interaction with the gluon condensates of QCD, simulated by a
scalar dilaton field introduced to incorporate the broken scale invariance of
QCD within the effective chiral model. We also compute the partial decay widths
of the charmonium states to the $D\bar {D}$ pairs in the hadronic medium. The
strong dependence on density of the in-medium properties of the $D$, $\bar{D}$
and the charmonium states, as well as the partial decay widths of charmonium
states to $D\bar {D}$ pairs, found in the present investigation, will be of
direct relevance in observables like open charm enhancement as well as $J/\psi$
suppression in the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiments at the future
Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, GSI, where the baryonic matter at
high densities is planned to be produced.

combinations which lead to coexistence in a uniform environment may favor
alternative stable states in a spatial system, and vice versa. Furthermore,
differences in growth rate, mortality or dispersal abilities allow a consumer
to coexist stationarily with - or even outcompete - a competitor with lower

conditions for the occurrence of the Bose-Einstein condensation. The argument
supporting this expectation is that in some conditions attained in the core of
these objects, the typical De Broglie wavelength associated with helium nuclei
is of the order of the mean distance between neighboring nuclei. In these
conditions the system should depart from classical behavior showing quantum
effects. As helium nuclei are bosons, they are expected to condense.
  In order to explore the possibility of detecting the Bose-Einstein
condensation in the evolution of helium white dwarfs we have computed a set of
models for a variety of stellar masses and values of the condensation
temperature. We do not perform a detailed treatment of the condensation process
but mimic it by suppressing the nuclei contribution to the equation of state by
applying an adequate function. As the cooling of white dwarfs depends on
average properties of the whole stellar interior, this procedure should be
suitable for exploring the departure of the cooling process from that predicted
by the standard treatment.
  We find that the Bose-Einstein condensation has noticeable, but not dramatic
effects on the cooling process only for the most massive white dwarfs
compatible with a helium dominated interior (\approx 0.50 M_\odot) and very low
luminosities (say, Log(L/L_\odot) < -4.0). These facts lead us to conclude that
it seems extremely difficult to find observable signals of the Bose-Einstein
condensation.
  Recently, it has been suggested that the population of helium white dwarfs
detected in the globular cluster NGC 6397 is a good candidate for detecting
signals of the Bose-Einstein condensation. We find that these stars have masses
too low and are too bright to have an already condensed interior.

independently with two different codes. In neither simulation set are the
spirals the result of a collision-induced bar formation. Although there is
variation in the appearance of the waves with time, they do not disappear and
reform recurrently, as seen in other cases described in the literature. We also
present an analytic theory that can account for the wave structure, not as
propagating transients, nor as a fixed pattern propagating through the disc.
While these waves propagate through the disc, they are maintained by the
coherent oscillations initiated by the impulsive disturbance. Specifically, the
analytic theory suggests that they are caustic waves in ensembles of stars
pursuing correlated epicyclic orbits after the disturbance. This theory is an
extension of that developed by Struck and collaborators for colliding ring
galaxies.
  The models suggest that this type of wave may persist for a couple of Gyr.,
and galaxy interactions occur on comparable timescales, so waves produced by
the mechanism may be well represented in observed spirals. In particular, this
mechanism can account for the tightly wound, and presumably long-lived spirals,
seen in some nearby early-type galaxies. These spirals are also likely to be
common in groups and clusters, where fast encounters between galaxies occur
relatively frequently. However, as the spirals become tightly wound, and evolve
to modest amplitudes, they may be difficult to resolve unless they are nearby.
Nonetheless, the effect may be one of several processes that result from galaxy
harassment, and via wave-enhanced star formation contribute to the
Butcher-Oemler effect.

have been performed for decades now. With the forthcoming construction of large
arrays capable of tracking multiple millisecond pulsars, it is very likely we
will be able to make the first detection of gravitational radiation in the
nano-Hertz band, and test Einstein's theory of relativity by measuring the
polarization components of the detected signals. Since a gravitational wave
predicted by the most general relativistic metric theory of gravity accounts
for {\it six} polarization modes (the usual two Einstein's tensor polarizations
as well as two vector and two scalar wave components), we have estimated the
single-antenna sensitivities to these six polarizations. We find pulsar timing
experiments to be significantly more sensitive, over their entire observational
frequency band ($\approx 10^{-9} - 10^{-6}$ Hz), to scalar-longitudinal and
vector waves than to scalar-transverse and tensor waves. At $10^{-7}$ Hz and
with pulsars at a distance of $1$ kpc, for instance, we estimate an average
sensitivity to scalar-longitudinal waves that is more than two orders of
magnitude better than the sensitivity to tensor waves. Our results imply that a
direct detection of gravitational radiation by pulsar timing will result into a
test of the theory of general relativity that is more stringent than that based
on monitoring the decay of the orbital period of a binary system.

dispersion relation $f(E)\equiv\frac{E}{pc}(\neq 1)$ for massless particles.
This distorted energy-momentum relation can affect the radiation dominated
phase of the universe at sufficiently high temperature. This prompted the idea
of non-commutative inflation by Alexander, Brandenberger and Magueijo (2003,
2005 and 2007). These authors studied a one-parameter family of
non-relativistic dispersion relation that leads to inflation: the $\alpha$
family of curves $f(E)=1+(\lambda E)^{\alpha}$. We show here how the
conceptually different structure of symmetries of non-commutative spaces can
lead, in a mathematically consistent way, to the fundamental equations of
non-commutative inflation driven by radiation. We describe how this structure
can be considered independently of (but including) the idea of non-commutative
spaces as a starting point of the general inflationary deformation of
$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$. We analyze the conditions on the dispersion relation that
leads to inflation as a set of inequalities which plays the same role as the
slow roll conditions on the potential of a scalar field. We study conditions
for a possible numerical approach to obtain a general one parameter family of
dispersion relations that lead to successful inflation.

galaxies (BCG), based on OS we argue that BCGs can be considered as statistical
extremes of a well-established Schechter luminosity distribution when galaxies
are binned by redshift and not cluster-by-cluster. We presume that the reason
behind this might be that luminous red ellipticals in galaxy clusters are \em
not random \em samples of an overall luminosity distribution but biased by the
fact that they are in a cluster containing the BCG. We show that a simple
statistical toy model can reproduce the well-known magnitude gap between the

respective stellar surface fluxes. They represent the chromospheric radiative
energy losses presumably related to basal heating by the dissipation of
acoustic waves, plus a highly variable contribution due to magnetic activity.
Thanks to the large sample size, we find a very well defined lower limit, the
basal chromospheric Mg II h+k line flux of cool giant chromospheres, as a
function of T_eff. A total of 16 giants were observed several times, over a
period of up to 20 years. Their respective minimal Mg II h+k line fluxes
confirm the basal flux limit very well because none of their emissions dip
beneath the empirically deduced basal flux line representative for the overall
sample. Based on a total of 15 to 22 objects with very low Mg II h+k emission,
we find as limit: log F_Mg_h+k = 7.33 log T_eff - 21.75 (cgs units; based on
B-V). Within its uncertainties, this is almost the same relation as has been
found in the past for the geometrically much thinner chromospheres of main
sequence stars. Concerning any residual dependence of the basal flux on the
surface gravity it can be stated that over a gravity range of more than four
orders of magnitude (main-sequence stars to supergiants), the basal flux does
not appear to vary by more than a factor of 2. These findings are in good
agreement with the predictions by previous hydrodynamic models of acoustic wave
propagation and energy dissipation, as well as with earlier empirical
determinations. Finally, we discuss the idea that the ample energy flux of the
chromospheric acoustic waves in a cool giant may yield, as a by-product, the
energy flux required by its cool wind (i.e., non-dust-driven, ""Reimers-type""
mass-loss).

Goursat distributions, $\Delta^r$, living on compact manifolds (called Goursat
monsters) having open dense jet-like ($J^{\,r}(1,1)$-like) parts.
  By virtue of the results of Jean (1996), one was able, for each $r \ge 2$, to
recursively compute the {\it small growth vector\,} of \,$\Delta^r$ at any
point of the $r$-th monster. The result was got by performing series of $r$
operations taken, in function of the local geometry of \,$\Delta^r$ in

RR Lyrae variables - the Blazhko effect - represents a long-standing enigma in
stellar pulsation theory. No satisfactory explanation for the Blazhko effect
has been proposed so far. In this paper we focus on the Stothers (2006) idea,
in which modulation is caused by changes in the structure of the outer
convective zone, caused by a quasi-periodically changing magnetic field.
However, up to this date no quantitative estimates were made to investigate
whether such a mechanism can be operational and whether it is capable of
reproducing the light variation we observe in Blazhko variables. We address the
latter problem. We use a simplified model, in which the variation of turbulent
convection is introduced into the non-linear hydrodynamic models in an ad hoc
way, neglecting interaction with the magnetic field. We study the light curve
variation through the modulation cycle and properties of the resulting
frequency spectra. Our results are compared with Kepler observations of RR Lyr.
We find that reproducing the light curve variation, as is observed in RR Lyr,
requires a huge modulation of the mixing length, of the order of +/-50 per
cent, on a relatively short time-scale of less than 40 days. Even then, we are
not able to reproduce neither all the observed relations between modulation
components present in the frequency spectrum, nor the relations between Fourier
parameters describing the shape of the instantaneous light curves.

remove HI gas through ram-pressure stripping for any reasonable orbit
distribution. However, all dwarfs are known to have an ancient stellar
population (\geq 10 Gyr) from early epochs of vigorous star formation which,
through heating of HI, could allow the hot halo to remove this gas. Our model
looks at the evolution of these dwarf galaxies analytically as the host-galaxy
dark matter halo and coronal halo gas builds up over cosmic time. The dwarf
galaxies - treated as spherically symmetric, smooth distributions of dark
matter and gas - experience early star formation, which sufficiently heats the
gas allowing it to be removed easily through tidal stripping by the host
galaxy, or ram-pressure stripping by a tenuous hot halo (n_H = 3x10^{-4}

the Spitzer Space Telescope and X-ray observations have revealed large
populations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of the
X-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. To date, little is
known about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the masses
of their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolution
of black holes and galaxies. In this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infrared
selected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxy
cross-correlation function w_p(R). The observed clustering yields
characteristic dark matter halo masses of log (M_halo [h^-1 M_sun]) =
12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (QSO-1s) and obscured
quasars (Obs-QSOs), respectively. The results for QSO-1s are in excellent
agreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while we
conclude that the Obs-QSOs are at least as strongly clustered as the QSO-1s. We
test for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faint
Obs-QSOs, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on the
clustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clustering
amplitude of the Obs-QSOs by at most ~20%. We compare our results to previous
studies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering for
obscured quasars.

to investigate the detailed spatial distribution of infrared emission in these

modest, as observed in starbursts, or are so high that luminous active galactic
nuclei (AGNs; high emission surface brightness energy sources) are indicated.
The sample consists of 18 luminous buried AGN candidates and
starburst-classified LIRGs identified in earlier infrared spectroscopy. We find
that the infrared 18 micron emission from the buried AGN candidates is
generally compact, and the estimated emission surface brightnesses are high,
sometimes exceeding the maximum value observed in and theoretically predicted
for a starburst phenomenon. The starburst-classified LIRGs usually display
spatially extended 18 micron emission and the estimated emission surface
brightnesses are modest, within the range sustained by a starburst phenomenon.

default probabilities. Recovery rates are usually modelled independently, quite
often they are even assumed constant. Then, however, the structural connection
between recovery rates and default probabilities is lost and the tails of the
loss distribution can be underestimated considerably. The problem of
underestimating tail losses becomes even more severe, when calibration issues
are taken into account. To demonstrate this we choose a Merton-type structural
model as our reference system. Diffusion and jump-diffusion are considered as
underlying processes. We run Monte Carlo simulations of this model and
calibrate different recovery models to the simulation data. For simplicity, we
take the default probabilities directly from the simulation data. We compare a
reduced-form model for recoveries with a constant recovery approach. In
addition, we consider a functional dependence between recovery rates and
default probabilities. This dependence can be derived analytically for the
diffusion case. We find that the constant recovery approach drastically and
systematically underestimates the tail of the loss distribution. The
reduced-form recovery model shows better results, when all simulation data is
used for calibration. However, if we restrict the simulation data used for
calibration, the results for the reduced-form model deteriorate. We find the
most reliable and stable results, when we make use of the functional dependence
between recovery rates and default probabilities.

defined as the product of the first $n$ primes. In 1999, Odlyzko, Rubinstein
and Wolf provided convincing heuristics and empirical evidence for the truth of
the hypothesis that the jumping champions greater than 1 are 4 and the
primorials $p_{1}^{\sharp}, p_{2}^{\sharp}, p_{3}^{\sharp}, p_{4}^{\sharp},
p_{5}^{\sharp}, ...$, that is, $2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, ....$ In this paper, we
prove that an appropriate form of the Hardy-Littlewood prime $k$-tuple
conjecture for prime pairs and prime triples implies that all sufficiently
large jumping champions are primorials and that all sufficiently large
primorials are jumping champions over a long range of $x$.

identify z>6 galaxies from the near-IR HST imaging in three deep fields (HUDF,
HUDF09-2 & ERS). By adopting a rigorous set of criteria for rejecting low-z
interlopers, and by employing a deconfusion technique to allow the available
IRAC imaging to be included in the candidate selection process, we have derived
a robust sample of 70 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) spanning the redshift range
6.0<z<8.7. Based on our final sample we investigate the distribution of UV
spectral slopes (beta), finding a variance-weighted mean value of <beta>=-2.05
+/- 0.09 which, contrary to some previous results, is not significantly bluer
than displayed by lower-redshift starburst galaxies. We confirm the correlation
between UV luminosity and stellar mass reported elsewhere, but based on fitting
galaxy templates featuring a range of star-formation histories, metallicities
and reddening we find that, at z>=6, the range in mass-to-light ratio (M*/L_UV)
at a given UV luminosity could span a factor of ~50. Focusing on a sub-sample
of twenty-one candidates with IRAC detections at 3.6-microns we find that L*
LBGs at z~6.5 have a median stellar mass of M* = (2.1 +/- 1.1) x 10^9 Msun and
a median specific star-formation rate of 1.9 +/- 0.8 Gyr^-1. Using the same
sub-sample we have investigated the influence of nebular continuum and line
emission, finding that for the majority of candidates (16 out of 21) the
best-fitting stellar-mass estimates are reduced by less than a factor of 2.5.
Finally, a detailed comparison of our final sample with the results of previous
studies suggests that, at faint magnitudes, several high-redshift galaxy
samples in the literature are significantly contaminated by low-redshift
interlopers (abridged).

attracted considerable attention. To find analytical expression of quantum
discord is an intractable task. Exact results are known only for very special
states, namely, two-qubit X-shaped states. We present in this paper a geometric
viewpoint, from which two-qubit quantum discord can be described clearly. The
known results about X state discord are restated in the directly perceivable
geometric language. As a consequence, the dynamics of classical correlations
and quantum discord for an X state in the presence of decoherence is endowed
with geometric interpretation. More importantly, we extend the geometric method
to the case of more general states, for which numerical as well as analytica
results about quantum discord have not been found yet. Based on the support of
numerical computations, some conjectures are proposed to help us establish
geometric picture. We find that the geometric picture for these states has
intimate relationship with that for X states. Thereby in some cases analytical
expressions of classical correlations and quantum discord can be obtained.

impurity band conduction (IBC) mid-infrared detector on board AKARI, the
Japanese infrared astronomical satellite. IBC-type detectors are known to be
little influenced by ionizing radiation. However we find that the detector is
significantly affected by in-orbit ionizing radiation even after spikes induced
by ionizing particles are removed. The effects are described as changes mostly
in the offset of detector output, but not in the gain. We conclude that the
changes in the offset are caused mainly by increase in dark current. We
establish a method to correct these ionizing radiation effects. The method is
essential to improve the quality and to increase the sky coverage of the AKARI
mid-infrared all-sky-survey map.

Focusing on the unidirectional LO pair-density wave state, that spontaneously
breaks the continuous rotational and translational symmetries, we show that it
is characterized by two Goldstone modes, corresponding to a superfluid phase
and a smectic phonon. Because of the liquid-crystalline ""softness"" of the
latter, at finite temperature the 3d state is characterized by a vanishing LO
order parameter, quasi-Bragg peaks in the structure and momentum distribution
functions, and a ""charge""-4, paired Cooper-pairs, off-diagonal-long-range
order, with a superfluid-stiffness anisotropy that diverges near a transition
into a nonsuperfluid state. In addition to conventional integer vortices and
dislocations the LO superfluid smectic exhibits composite half-integer
vortex-dislocation defects. A proliferation of defects leads to a rich variety
of descendant states, such as the ""charge""-4 superfluid and Fermi-liquid
nematics and topologically ordered nonsuperfluid states, that generically
intervene between the LO state and the conventional superfluid and the
polarized Fermi-liquid at low and high imbalance, respectively. The fermionic
sector of the LO gapless superconductor is also quite unique, exhibiting a
Fermi surface of Bogoliubov quasiparticles associated with the Andreev band of

central goals of systems biology is the unraveling of the as yet poorly
characterized complex web of interactions among these components. This work is
made harder by the fact that new species and interactions are continuously
discovered in experimental work, necessitating the development of adaptive and
fast algorithms for network construction and updating. Thus, the
""reverse-engineering"" of networks from data has emerged as one of the central
concern of systems biology research.
  A variety of reverse-engineering methods have been developed, based on tools
from statistics, machine learning, and other mathematical domains. In order to
effectively use these methods, it is essential to develop an understanding of
the fundamental characteristics of these algorithms. With that in mind, this
chapter is dedicated to the reverse-engineering of biological systems.
  Specifically, we focus our attention on a particular class of methods for
reverse-engineering, namely those that rely algorithmically upon the so-called
""hitting-set"" problem, which is a classical combinatorial and computer science
problem, Each of these methods utilizes a different algorithm in order to
obtain an exact or an approximate solution of the hitting set problem. We will
explore the ultimate impact that the alternative algorithms have on the

the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection

to exhaust their envelopes and shrink rapidly before the explosion. This
outcome seems most likely for SD SN Ia progenitors where mass-transfer begins
from a giant donor star, and might extend to other SD systems. Not only is the
amount of hydrogen left in such a system below the current detection limit, but
the donor star is typically orders of magnitude smaller than its Roche lobe by
the point when a SD SN Ia occurs, in which case attempts to observe collisions
between SN shocks and giant donor stars seem unlikely to succeed. We consider
the constraints on this model from the circumstellar structures seen in spectra

clinical trials with binary response. The target is to find the design that
maximizes the power of the relevant test. Many papers use a normal
approximation to the power function and claim that Neyman allocation that
assigns subjects to treatment groups according to the ratio of the responses'
standard deviations, should be used. As the standard deviations are unknown, an
adaptive design is often recommended. The asymptotic justification of this
approach is arguable, since it uses the normal approximation in tails where the
error in the approximation is larger than the estimated quantity. We consider
two different approaches for optimality of designs that are related to Pitman
and Bahadur definitions of relative efficiency of tests. We prove that the
optimal allocation according to the Pitman criterion is the balanced allocation
and that the optimal allocation according to the Bahadur approach depends on
the unknown parameters. Exact calculations reveal that the optimal allocation
according to Bahadur is often close to the balanced design, and the powers of
both are comparable to the Neyman allocation for small sample sizes and are
generally better for large experiments. Our findings have important
implications to the design of experiments, as the balanced design is proved to
be optimal or close to optimal and the need for the complications involved in
following an adaptive design for the purpose of increasing the power of tests
is therefore questionable.

external electrical fields enables a variety of different device concepts with
novel functionalities for electronic, optoelectronic and sensor applications.
So far the operation of bilayer graphene based field effect transistors
requires two individual gates to vary the channel's conductance and to create a
band gap. In this paper we report on a method to increase the on/off ratio in
single gated bilayer graphene field effect transistors by adsorbate doping. The
adsorbate dopants on the upper side of the graphene establish a displacement
field perpendicular to the graphene surface breaking the inversion symmetry of
the two graphene layers. Low temperature measurements indicate, that the
increased on/off ratio is caused by the opening of a mobility gap. Beside field
effect transistors the presented approach can also be employed for other
bilayer graphene based devices like photodetectors for THz to infrared
radiation, chemical sensors and in more sophisticated structures such as
antidot- or superlattices where an artificial potential landscape has to be

the influence of the rhombic term, which is responsible for an onset of quantum

It is shown that the rhombic term gradually destroys a classical ferrimagnetic

in the magnetization as well as several unusual field-induced transitions
accompanied with magnetization jumps. Another interesting findings concern with
an appearance of the round minimum in the temperature dependence of
susceptibility times temperature data, the double-peak zero-field specific heat
curves and the enhanced magnetocaloric effect. The temperature dependence of
the specific heat with three separate maxima may also be detected when driving

winding is accelerated by the relativistic dispersion of graphene at
half-filling leading to an integer occupation. We show that the renormalization
parameter that shifts the impurity level is insufficient to invert the sign of
the energy level. Consequently, the state at half-filling is stable unless a
gate voltage is tuned such that the Fermi level touches the edge of the
broadened impurity level. Only in this case the zero field susceptibility is
finite and shows a pronounced peak structure with the gate voltage.

for many relays and sources, short-message QF with backward decoding achieves
the same rates as long-message QF. Several practical advantages of
short-message encoding are pointed out, e.g., reduced delay and simpler
modulation. Furthermore, short-message encoding lets relays use decode-forward
(DF) if their channel quality is good, thereby enabling multiinput,
multi-output (MIMO) gains that are not possible with long-message encoding.
Finally, one may combine the advantages of long- and short-message encoding by
hashing a long message to short messages.

application of the technique to quantum posts has allowed us to fabricate
nanostructures of exceptional length (120 nm). In situ accumulated measurements
show that, even in shorter nanostrcutures, relaxation processes can be

We employ a game-theoretic model of dynamic network formation where successful

strategies and copy their social network. We find that, despite using the same
mechanism, cooperators promote well-connected highly prosperous networks and
defectors cause the network to fragment and lose its prosperity; defectors are
unable to maintain the highly connected networks they invade. Once the network
is fragmented it can be reconstructed by a new invasion of cooperators, leading
to the cycle of formation and fragmentation seen, for example, in bacterial
communities and socio-economic networks. In this endless struggle between
cooperators and defectors we observe that cooperation leads to prosperity, but
prosperity is associated with instability. Cooperation is prosperous when the

constraints can be obtained from polarization at the $0.03$ level after four

the current limits from WMAP temperature data (after correction for beam
asymmetries), Planck should constrain the spectral index $q$ of power-law
departures from asymmetry to $\Delta q = 0.3$. Finally, we show how to

debris disks, with dust residuals, has not yet been clearly understood. Disks
are expected to dissipate with time, and dust clearing in the inner regions can
be the consequence of several mechanisms. Planetary formation is one of them
that will possibly open a gap inside the disk. According to recent models based
on photometric observations, T Cha is expected to present a large gap within
its disk, meaning that an inner dusty disk is supposed to have survived close
to the star. We investigate this scenario with new near-infrared
interferometric observations. We observed T Cha in the H and K bands using the
AMBER instrument at VLTI and used the MCFOST radiative transfer code to model
the SED of T Cha and the interferometric observations simultaneously and to
test the scenario of an inner dusty structure. We also used a toy model of a
binary to check that a companion close to the star can reproduce our
observations. The scenario of a close (few mas) companion cannot satisfactorily
reproduce the visibilities and SED, while a disk model with a large gap and an
inner ring producing the bulk of the emission (in H and K-bands) close to 0.1
AU is able to account for all the observations. With this study, the presence
of an optically thick inner dusty disk close to the star and dominating the H
and K- bands emission is confirmed. According to our model, the large gap
extends up to ~ 7.5 AU. This points toward a companion (located at several AU)
gap-opening scenario to explain the morphology of T Cha.

transport. This may ruin the performance of devices such as quantum-cascade

polarization balance and polarization-balanced designs: A structure is
polarization balanced when the applied bias match the voltage drop arising from
spontaneous and piezeolectric fields. Devices designed to operate at this bias
have polarization-balanced designs. These concepts offer a systematic approach
to avoid the formation of depletion regions. As a test case, we consider the

simple relation between the intrinsic voltage drop arising from polar effects,
average alloy composition of the active region, and the alloy concentration of
the leads. Polarization-balanced designs secure good filling of the ground
state for unbiased structures, while for biased structures with efficient
emptying of the active structure it removes the depletion barriers.

Consider a complete binary tree T and construct a random pairing {\Pi} between
leaf nodes and internal nodes. We prove that the graph G\Pi obtained from T by
contracting all pairs (leaf-internal nodes) achieves a constant node expansion
with high probability. The use of our result in improving the robustness of
tree overlays is straightforward. That is, if each physical node participating
to the overlay manages a random pair that couples one virtual internal node and
one virtual leaf node then the physical-node layer exhibits a constant
expansion with high probability. We encompass the difficulty of obtaining this
random tree virtualization by proposing a local, selforganizing and churn
resilient uniformly-random pairing algorithm with O(log2 n) running time. Our
algorithm has the merit to not modify the original tree virtual overlay (we
just control the mapping between physical nodes and virtual nodes). Therefore,
our scheme is general and can be applied to a large number of tree overlay

containing up to six H atoms are investigated systematically -- the clusters
having either all H atoms on one side of the graphene sheet
(\textit{cis}-clusters) or having the H atoms on both sides in an alternating
manner (\textit{trans}-cluster). The most stable cis-clusters found have H
atoms in ortho- and para-positions with respect to each other (two H's on
neighboring or diagonally opposite carbon positions within one carbon hexagon)
while the most stable trans-clusters found have H atoms in
ortho-trans-positions with respect to each other (two H's on neighboring carbon
positions, but on opposite sides of the graphene). Very stable trans-clusters
with 13-22 H atoms were identified by optimizing the number of H atoms in
ortho-trans-positions and thereby the number of closed, H-covered carbon
hexagons. For the cis-clusters, the associative H$_2$ desorption was
investigated. Generally, the desorption with the lowest activation energy
proceeds via para-cis-dimer states, i.e.\ involving somewhere in the H clusters
two H atoms that are positioned on opposite sites within one carbon hexagon.
H$_2$ desorption from clusters lacking such H pairs is calculated to occur via
hydrogen diffusion causing the formation of para-cis-dimer states. Studying the
diffusion events showed a strong dependence of the diffusion energy barriers on
the reaction energies and a general odd-even dependence on the number of H
atoms in the cis-clusters.

  curvature bound and applications","48 pages",,,,"math.DG math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove a new kind of estimate that holds on any manifold with lower Ricci
bounds. It relates the geometry of two small balls with the same radius,
potentially far apart, but centered in the interior of a common minimizing
geodesic. It reveals new, previously unknown, properties that all generalized
spaces with a lower Ricci curvature bound must have and it has a number of
applications.
  This new kind of estimate asserts that the geometry of small balls along any
minimizing geodesic changes in a H\""older continuous way with a constant
depending on the lower bound for the Ricci curvature, the dimension of the
manifold, and the distance to the end points of the geodesic. We give examples
that show that the H\""older exponent, along with essentially all the other
consequences that we show follow from this estimate, are sharp. The unified
theme for all of these applications is convexity.
  Among the applications is that the regular set is convex for any
non-collapsed limit of Einstein metrics. In the general case of potentially
collapsed limits of manifolds with just a lower Ricci curvature bound we show
that the regular set is weakly convex and $a.e.$ convex, that is almost every
pair of points can be connected by a minimizing geodesic whose interior is
contained in the regular set. We also show two conjectures of Cheeger-Colding.
One of these asserts that the isometry group of any, even collapsed, limit of
manifolds with a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound is a Lie group; the key
point for this is to rule out small subgroups. The other asserts that the
dimension of any limit space is the same everywhere. Finally, we show that a
Reifenberg type property holds for collapsed limits and discuss why this
indicate further regularity of manifolds and spaces with Ricci curvature
bounds.

extremely blue UV continuum slopes, with a UV power-law index beta ~ -3. Such
slopes are bluer than previously reported for any other galaxy population, and
imply extinction-free, young, very low-metallicity stellar populations with a
high ionizing photon escape fraction. Here we undertake a critical study of the
evidence for such extreme values of beta, combining three new WFC3/IR-selected
samples of galaxies spanning ~2 decades in UV luminosity over the redshift
range z~4.5-8. We explore the impact of inclusion/exclusion of less robust
high-z candidates, and use the varying depths of the samples to explore the
effects of noise and selection bias. Simple data-consistency arguments suggest
that artificially blue average values of beta can result when the analysis is
extended into the deepest ~ 0.5-mag bin of these WFC3/IR-selected samples,
regardless of the actual luminosity or z range probed. By confining attention
to robust, well-detected high-z galaxy candidates, we find that the average
value of beta is consistent with -2.05 +/- 0.10 for z=5-7, and -22 < M_UV <
-18. We create and analyse a set of simulations which demonstrate that a bias
towards artifically low/blue average values of beta is indeed expected when the
UV slope analysis is extended towards the source detection threshold, and
conclude that there is as yet no clear evidence for UV slopes significantly
bluer than beta ~ -2, the typical value displayed by the bluest star-forming
galaxies at more modest z. A robust measurement of beta for the faintest
galaxies at z~7-8 remains a key observational goal, as it provides a
fundamental test for high escape fractions from a potentially abundant source
of reionizing photons. This goal is achievable with HST, but requires still
deeper WFC3/IR imaging in the HUDF.

on the mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) model. It has been shown that MMNL models
encompass all discrete choice models derived under the assumption of random
utility maximization, subject to the identification of an unknown distribution
$G$. Noting the mixture model description of the MMNL, we employ a Bayesian
nonparametric approach, using nonparametric priors on the unknown mixing
distribution $G$, to estimate choice probabilities. We provide an important
theoretical support for the use of the proposed methodology by investigating
consistency of the posterior distribution for a general nonparametric prior on
the mixing distribution. Consistency is defined according to an $L_1$-type
distance on the space of choice probabilities and is achieved by extending to a
regression model framework a recent approach to strong consistency based on the
summability of square roots of prior probabilities. Moving to estimation,
slightly different techniques for non-panel and panel data models are
discussed. For practical implementation, we describe efficient and relatively
easy-to-use blocked Gibbs sampling procedures. These procedures are based on
approximations of the random probability measure by classes of finite
stick-breaking processes. A simulation study is also performed to investigate
the performance of the proposed methods.

in practice only be achieved through highly nonlinear interactions within a

to obtain the extremely strong nonlinear coupling needed to facilitate
interactions between two faint light fields. Here, we demonstrate for the first

widths down to a few kHz and a change from essentially full transmission to
full absorption of the probe field within a window of only ~100 kHz are
achieved. By applying a weak switching field, we furthermore demonstrate nearly
