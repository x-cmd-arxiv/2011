directed perpendicularly to the crystal lattice layers, it has been
demonstrated that the layered-structure effects can be observed not only in
crystals with highly open Fermi surfaces, as was conventionally believed
earlier, but also in crystals with closed ones. The calculations were carried
out in the constant-relaxation-time approximation. In weak magnetic fields,
layered-structure effects manifest themselves as a phase retardation of
Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations and a certain increase of the relative
contribution made by the latter. In the range of high magnetic fields, there
exists an optimal interval, in which the layered-structure effects reveal
themselves in the form of a sharp non-monotonous dependence of conductivity on
the magnetic field. In addition, it has been shown that the layered-structure
effects result in a decrease of the proportionality factor between the
magnetoresistance and the magnetic induction in the longitudinal Kapitsa
effect. The longitudinal conductivity of layered crystals in ultra-quantum
magnetic fields has also been analyzed. It is shown that the following
dependences of the magnetoresistance on the magnetic field can be obtained,
depending on the model used for the filling of the single Landau subband and on
whether the longitudinal conductivity is considered to be of either the drift
or diffusion type: $\rho_{zz}\propto TB^{2}$,\ $\rho_{zz}\propto B^{3}$, and
$\rho_{zz}\propto B^{4}$.

electron based on the corpuscular-wave monism using the further development of
the optical-mechanical analogy to describe the physical reality. In this theory
the motion of an electron is considered to occur along a trajectory the
presence of which is a reflection of the existence of a particle, as well as it
is assumed that any motion is defined by a wave V(x,t). It is assumed that
there is an explicit relationship between the trajectory and wave equations of
the electron, which are established on the basis of the local variational
principle. In this approach, an electron wave propagating in free space takes
along the electron trajectory. We used this theory to describe the electron
motion in a hydrogen-like atom and found its stationary states. The energies of
these states coincide with the known quantum mechanics solutions for the
stationary energies of the hydrogen-like atom, however, in our approach the
spatial trajectories of the electron have the form of the surfaces, which are
formed in the region of nodes of the standing electron wave. These surfaces
have the form of spheres for the spherical symmetrical electron states and the
radii of these spheres coincide with the radii of the Bohr orbits of these
states. Thus, in this approach the trajectory and wave measurements of the
electron get a consistent spatial description that is inherent to the picture
of the corpuscular-wave monism. We discuss the considerable correspondence of
the proposed theory with the quantum mechanics results describing the
stationary and non-stationary motions of the electron in the atom and their
difference. We believe that measuring of the spatial configuration of the
observed electron trajectory surfaces in an atom could be a deep examination of
the standard quantum theory.

the (111) surfaces we demonstrate that the interaction shows an oscillatory
behavior as a function of the distance, R, of the impurities and that the
amplitude of the oscillations decays as 1/R^2. Furthermore, the frequency of
the oscillations is closely related to the length of the Fermi vector of the
surface states existing on these surfaces. Due to the asymmetry of the the
surface states' dispersion, the frequency of the oscillations becomes also
asymmetric on the (110) surfaces, while on the Au(111) surface two distinct
frequencies are found in the oscillations as a consequence of the
Bychkov-Rashba splitting of the surface states. Remarkably, no long range
oscillations of the exchange interaction are observed for the (001) surfaces
where the surface states are unoccupied. When burying the impurities beneath
the surface layer, oscillations mediated by the bulk states become visible.

saddle-point approximation, we find at half filling a sharp transition between
two different regimes of small and large coherent oscillations, separated by a
critical line of quenches where the system is found to relax. Any finite doping
washes out the transition, leaving aside just a sharp crossover. In order to
investigate the role of quantum fluctuations, we map the model onto an
auxiliary Quantum Ising Model in a transverse field coupled to free fermionic
quasiparticles. Remarkably, the Gutzwiller approximation turns out to
correspond to the mean field decoupling of this model in the limit of infinite
coordination lattices. The advantage is that we can go beyond mean field and
include gaussian fluctuations around the non equilibrium mean field dynamics.
Unlike at equilibrium, we find that quantum fluctuations become massless and
eventually unstable before the mean field dynamical critical line, which
suggests they could even alter qualitatively the mean field scenario.

suggested that this system was unlike any previously known pre-MS system. Our

expected in the core of massive neutron stars. If this deconfinement phase
transition is of the first order then it will be triggered by the nucleation of
a critical size drop of the stable quark phase in the metastable hadronic
phase. Within these circumstances it has been shown that cold pure hadronic
compact stars above a threshold value of their gravitational mass are
metastable with respect to the ""decay"" to quark stars (compact stars made at
least in part of quark matter). This stellar conversion process liberates a
huge amount of energy, and it could be the energy source of some of the long
GRBs. The main goal of the present work is to establish whether a newborn
hadronic star (proto-hadronic star) could survive the early stages of its
evolution without ""decaying"" to a quark star. To this aim, we study the
nucleation process of quark matter in hot beta-stable hadronic matter, with and
without trapped neutrinos. We calculate and compare the nucleation rate and the
nucleation time due to thermal and quantum nucleation mechanisms. We compute
the crossover temperature above which thermal nucleation dominates the finite
temperature quantum nucleation mechanism. We next discuss the consequences of
quark matter nucleation for the physics and the evolution of proto-neutron
stars. We introduce the new concept of limiting conversion temperature and
critical mass M_cr for proto-hadronic stars, and we show that proto-hadronic
stars with a mass M < M_cr could survive the early stages of their evolution
without decaying to a quark star. We extend the concept of maximum mass of a
""neutron star"" with respect to the classical one introduced by Oppenheimer &
Volkoff to account for the existence of two distinct families of compact stars
(hadronic stars and quark stars) as predicted by the present scenario.

characterised by intrinsically redder colours is consisted of many different SN
events that exhibit diverse properties, including the interaction with the
circumstellar material, the existence of specific shell-structure in or
surrounding the SN ejecta or super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitors. Compared
with the normal objects, these SNe may violate the standard width-luminosity
correction, which could influence the cosmological results if they were all
calibrated equally, since their fraction among SNe Ia is not negligible when
performing precision cosmology. Using largest wavelet scale coefficient in
combination with long-baseline B-I colours, we show how to disentangle SN
intrinsic colour from the part that corresponds to the reddening due to dust
extinction in the host galaxy in the SALT2 colour parameter c, discussing how
the intrinsic colour differences may explain the different reddening laws for
two subsamples. There are wavelength intervals for which the measured largest
scale coefficient is invariant to the additional extinction applied to a
spectrum. Combination of wavelet coefficients measured in different wavelength

sample of blue horizontal branch stars (Teff=12000-22000 K) in NGC2808, a
cluster known to host three distinct stellar populations and a multimodal
horizontal branch. The final sample consists of 64 targets. The radial velocity
of the targets was measured in fourteen epochs, spanning a temporal interval of
about 75 days. We detect no RV variable object among stars cooler than the
photometric G1 gap at 17000 K, while two close (P<10 days) and two
intermediate-period (P=10-50 days) systems are found among hotter targets. The
close and intermediate-period binary fraction for stars cooler than the gap are
fc<5% and fip<10%, respectively, with 95% confidence. The most probable values
among hotter stars are fc~20% and fip~30%, but the 90%- confidence level
intervals are large (6-42% and 11-72%, respectively). The G1 gap appears as a
discontinuity in the binary faction, with a higher incidence of binaries among
hotter stars, but a constant increase in f with temperature rather than a
discontinuity cannot be excluded from our observations. We find that
intermediate-period binaries, never investigated before among cluster HB stars,
could play an important role, being more than ~15-20% of the hottest stars of
our sample. Our results indicate that fc among hot HB stars is most probably
higher for younger clusters, confirming the recently proposed age-fc relation.
However, the large observed difference in binary fraction between clusters

Pleiades, Praesepe, alpha Per, and M67 (d=47+-2,138+-6,183+-8,171+-8,815+-40

Wesenheit magnitudes (W_VI,0), evolutionary status, and pulsation modes (order,
n). The reliability of JHKs established cluster parameters is demonstrated via
a comparison with van Leeuwen 2009 revised HIP results. Distances for 7 of 9
nearby (d<250 pc) clusters agree, and the discrepant cases (Pleiades & Blanco
1) are unrelated to (insignificant) Te/J-Ks variations with cluster age or
[Fe/H]. JHKs photometry is tabulated for ~3x10^3 probable cluster members on
the basis of proper motions (NOMAD). The deep JHKs photometry extends into the
low mass regime (~0.4 Msun) and ensures precise (<5%) ZAMS fits. Pulsation
modes inferred for the cluster delta Scutis from VI Wesenheit and independent
analyses are comparable (+-n), and the methods are consistent in identifying
higher order pulsators. Most small-amplitude cluster delta Scutis lie on VI
Wesenheit loci characterizing n>~1 pulsators. A distance established to NGC
1817 from delta Scutis (d~1.7 kpc) via a universal VI Wesenheit template agrees
with estimates in the literature, assuming the variables delineate the n>~1

plus others. (Which others is part of the art of functional approximation). In
the time-dependent case, as we shall see, the adiabatic LDA (ALDA) plays the
same role as LDA in the ground-state case, as it satisfies many exact

targets with collinear flankers, compared to configurations where flankers
differ from the target in orientation or angular position. In particular, rats
are more likely to miss the target when flankers are collinear. The same
impairment is found even when the flanker luminance was sign-reversed relative

This is the first report that the arrangement of visual features relative to

is remarkably simple and does not involve a complex nanostructure of the type
that is often associated with metamaterials. Instead it is based on the
homogenization of only isotropic dielectric and isotropic magnetic component
mediums, which are distributed randomly as oriented spheroidal particles. Using
the inverse Bruggeman homogenization formalism, we demonstrated that a wide
range of constitutive parameter values for the Tamm medium may be accessed
through varying the particle shape, volume fraction or relative permittivity
and relative permeability of the component mediums. The presented formulation
is appropriate for the regions of spacetime which lie outside the event horizon

liquid states is the very fact that they violate the Landau paradigm, making
conventional order parameters non-existent. Here, we uncover a spin liquid
phase in a Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice, and measure its
topological order directly via the topological entanglement entropy. This is
the first smoking-gun demonstration of a non-trivial spin liquid, identified
through its entanglement entropy as a gapped groundstate with emergent Z2 gauge
symmetry.

X-ray flares occurring during the GRB afterglows are quite common, being

regards the internal shock scenario, interpreting the X-ray flares as late time

of the X-ray flares adopting the same physical model recently used to interpret
the GRB prompt emission: the log-parabolic function. In particular, we show
that their spectral energy distribution (SED) is remarkably curved, while no
significant curvature appears in the underlying X-ray afterglow emission. In
addition, the log-parabolic function is statistically favored with respect to
other proposed spectral models. By using a time resolved spectral analysis, we
show the evolution of the peak energy and the curvature parameters of the SED
during the X-ray flares in two of the brightest GRBs afterglows observed by
SWIFT. We found that in the X-ray flares there is an anti-correlation between
the peak energy and the curvature, as expected in a stochastic acceleration

naturally leads to the particular chemical properties of the ancient globular

  We show that the isolation of EMSTO clusters to intermediate ages is the
consequence of observational selection effects. In our proposed scenario, the

any evident trend between spin and Hubble type, besides an increase in the
scatter for the latest types. According to the model, galaxies evolve along a
roughly constant mass-size relation, increasing their scale-lengths as they
become more massive. The radial scale-length of most disks in our sample seems

that this is a binary star with a highly eccentric orbit, e=0.83. We are able
to match the Kepler light curve and radial velocities with a nearly face-on
(i=5.5 degree) binary star model in which the brightening events are caused by
tidal distortion and irradiation of nearly identical A stars during their close
periastron passage. The two dominant oscillations in the light curve,

known antiferromagnetic state with in-phase lattice dimerization along one

moderate to strong frustration, however, the dominant phase is a novel
spin-singlet paired-electron crystal (PEC), consisting of pairs of charge-rich
sites separated by pairs of charge-poor sites. The PEC, with coexisting
charge-order and spin-gap in two dimension, is the quarter-filled band
equivalent of the valence bond solid (VBS) that can appear in the frustrated
half-filled band within antiferromagnetic spin Hamiltonians. We discuss the
phase diagram as a function of on-site and intersite Coulomb interactions as
well as electron-phonon coupling strength. We speculate that the spin-bonded
pairs of the PEC can become mobile for even stronger frustration, giving rise
to a paired-electron liquid. We discuss the implications of the PEC concept for
understanding several classes of quarter-filled band materials that display

envelope due to their stellar wind, but mass stripping due to interaction with
a companion star in a binary system is currently considered to be the dominant
formation channel. We computed an extensive grid of binary models with the
Eggleton binary evolution code. The predicted rate from our standard models,
which assume conservative mass transfer, is about 6 times smaller than the
current rate indicated by observations. It is larger but still comparable to
the rate expected from single stars. To recover the observed rate we must
generously allow for uncertainties and low accretion efficiencies in
combination with limited angular momentum loss from the system. Motivated by
the claims of detection and non-detection of companions for a few IIb
supernovae, we investigate the properties of the secondary star at the moment
of explosion. We identify three cases: (1) the companion appears as a hot O
star in about 90% of the cases, (2) the companion becomes an over-luminous B
star in about 3% of the cases, or (3) the companion will appear as a K
supergiant. The second case, which applies to the well-studied case of SN 1993J
and possibly to SN 2001ig, is the least common case and requires that the
companion very efficiently accretes the transferred material -in contrast to
what is required to recover the overall IIb rate. The fast increasing number of
type IIb detections may lead to more solid constraints on model uncertainties,
like stellar wind-mass loss and internal mixing.

surface brightnesses as detected by GALEX, are intensely star-forming galaxies
in the low-redshift universe ($z\sim 0.2$), with star formation rates reaching
up to 50 times that of the Milky Way. These objects present metallicities,
morphologies and other physical properties similar to higher redshift Lyman
Break Galaxies (LBGs), motivating the detailed study of LBAs as local
laboratories of this high-redshift galaxy population. We present results from
our recent integral-field spectroscopy survey of LBAs with Keck/OSIRIS, which
shows that these galaxies have the same nebular gas kinematic properties as
high-redshift LBGs. We argue that such kinematic studies alone are not an
appropriate diagnostic to rule out merger events as the trigger for the
observed starburst. Comparison between the kinematic analysis and morphological
indices from HST imaging illustrates the difficulties of properly identifying
(minor or major) merger events, with no clear correlation between the results
using either of the two methods. Artificial redshifting of our data indicates
that this problem becomes even worse at high redshift due to surface brightness
dimming and resolution loss. Whether mergers could generate the observed
kinematic properties is strongly dependent on gas fractions in these galaxies.
We present preliminary results of a CARMA survey for LBAs and discuss the
implications of the inferred molecular gas masses for formation models.

Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. Here we report on a new search for glitches
in the observations, revealing 128 new glitches in the rotation of 63 pulsars.
Combining these new data with those already published we present a database
containing 315 glitches in 102 pulsars. The database was used to study the
glitch activity among the pulsar population, finding that it peaks for pulsars
with a characteristic age tau_c ~ 10kyr and decreases for longer values of
tau_c, disappearing for objects with tau_c > 20Myr. The glitch activity is also
smaller in the very young pulsars (tau_c <~ 1kyr). The cumulative effect of
glitches, a collection of instantaneous spin up events, acts to reduce the
regular long term spindown rate |nudot| of the star. The percentage of |nudot|
reversed by glitch activity was found to vary between 0.5% and 1.6% for pulsars
with spindown rates |nudot| between 10^(-14) and 3.2*10^(-11) Hz/s, decreasing
to less than 0.01% at both higher and lower spindown rates. These ratios are
interpreted in terms of the amount of superfluid involved in the generation of
glitches. In this context the activity of the youngest pulsar studied, the Crab
pulsar, may be explained by quake-like activity within the crust. Pulsars with
low spindown rates seem to exhibit mostly small glitches, matching well the
decrease of their crustal superfluid.
  Through the analysis of glitch sizes it was found that the particular
glitching behaviour of PSR J0537-6910 and the Vela pulsar may be shared by most
Vela-like pulsars. These objects present most of their glitches with
characteristic frequency and frequency derivative jumps, occurring at regular
intervals of time. Their behaviour is different from other glitching pulsars of
similar characteristic age.

valuation function $v:2^N\rightarrow\RR$ over the subsets of nodes, the problem
is to find a partition of $N$ into connected subsets, that maximises the sum of
the components' values. This problem is generally NP--complete; in particular,
it is hard for a defined class of valuation functions which are {\it
independent of disconnected members}---that is, two nodes have no effect on
each other's marginal contribution to their vertex separator. Nonetheless, for
all such functions we provide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure
generation over general and minor free graphs. Our proof is constructive and
yields algorithms for solving corresponding instances of the problem.
Furthermore, we derive polynomial time bounds for acyclic, $K_{2,3}$ and $K_4$
minor free graphs. However, as we show, the problem remains NP--complete for
planar graphs, and hence, for any $K_k$ minor free graphs where $k\geq 5$.
Moreover, our hardness result holds for a particular subclass of valuation
functions, termed {\it edge sum}, where the value of each subset of nodes is
simply determined by the sum of given weights of the edges in the induced

low-energy electrons (100-200eV). Because of the low energies used, the
graphene is neither damaged or contaminated by the electron beam. The
transparency of graphene is measured to be 74%, equivalent to electron
transmission through a sheet as thick as twice the covalent radius of
sp^2-bonded carbon. Also observed is rippling in the structure of the suspended
graphene, with a wavelength of approximately 26 nm. The interference of the
electron beam due to the diffraction off the edge of a graphene knife edge is
observed and used to calculate a virtual source size of 4.7 +/- 0.6 Angstroms
for the electron emitter. It is demonstrated that graphene can be used as both
anode and substrate in PPM in order to avoid distortions due to strong field
gradients around nano-scale objects. Graphene can be used to image objects
suspended on the sheet using PPM, and in the future, electron holography.

electromagnetic field. By employing concepts and techniques of open quantum
systems we introduce coarse-graining to the physical variables - the medium,
the quantum field and the atom's internal degrees of freedom, in that order -
to extract their averaged effects from the lowest tier progressively to the top
tier. The first tier of coarse-graining provides the averaged effect of the
medium upon the field, quantified by a complex permittivity (in the frequency
domain) describing the response of the dielectric to the field in addition to
its back action on the field through a stochastic forcing term. The last tier
of coarse- graining over the atom's internal degrees of freedom results in an
equation of motion for the atom's center of mass from which we can derive the
force on the atom. Our nonequilibrium formulation provides a fully dynamical
description of the atom's motion including back action effects from all other
relevant variables concerned. In the long-time limit we recover the known
results for the atom-dielectric force when the combined system is in

the edges of the acyclic graph representing the network are assumed to have
zero-delay) have been extensively dealt with in the recent past. The most
prominent of these problems include (a) the existence of network codes that
achieve maximum rate of transmission, (b) efficient network code constructions,
and (c) field size issues. In practice, however, networks have transmission
delays. In network coding theory, such networks with transmission delays are
generally abstracted by assuming that their edges have integer delays. Note
that using enough memory at the nodes of an acyclic network with integer delays
can effectively simulate instantaneous behavior, which is probably why only
acyclic instantaneous networks have been primarily focused on thus far. In this
work, we elaborate on issues ((a), (b) and (c) above) related to network coding
for acyclic networks with integer delays, which have till now mostly been
overlooked. We show that the delays associated with the edges of the network
cannot be ignored, and in fact turn out to be advantageous, disadvantageous or
immaterial, depending on the topology of the network and the problem considered
i.e., (a), (b) or (c). In the process, we also show that for a single source
multicast problem in acyclic networks (instantaneous and with delays), the
network coding operations at each node can simply be limited to storing old
symbols and coding them over a binary field. Therefore, operations over
elements of larger fields are unnecessary in the network, the trade-off being
that enough memory exists at the nodes and at the sinks, and that the sinks
have more processing power.

slightly reduced update times lead to exploding query times. Consider
incremental connectivity, letting t_u be the time to insert an edge and t_q be
the query time. For t_u = Omega(t_q), the problem is equivalent to the
well-understood union-find problem: InsertEdge(s,t) can be implemented by
Union(Find(s), Find(t)). This gives worst-case time t_u = t_q = O(lg n / lglg
n) and amortized t_u = t_q = O(alpha(n)).
  By contrast, we show that if t_u = o(lg n / lglg n), the query time explodes
to t_q >= n^{1-o(1)}. In other words, if the data structure doesn't have time
to find the roots of each disjoint set (tree) during edge insertion, there is
no effective way to organize the information!
  For amortized complexity, we demonstrate a new inverse-Ackermann type
trade-off in the regime t_u = o(t_q).
  A similar lower bound is given for fully dynamic connectivity, where an
update time of o(\lg n) forces the query time to be n^{1-o(1)}. This lower
bound allows for amortization and Las Vegas randomization, and comes close to
the known O(lg n * poly(lglg n)) upper bound.

technology, called spintronics, where the spin of electrons is explored to
carry information. [1,2] Several techniques have been developed to generate
pure spin currents in many materials and structures. [3-10] However, there is
still no method available that can be used to directly detect pure spin
currents, which carry no net charge current and no net magnetization.
Currently, studies of pure spin currents rely on measuring the induced spin
accumulation with optical techniques [5, 11-13] or spin-valve configurations.
[14-17] However, the spin accumulation does not directly reflect the spatial
distribution or temporal dynamics of the pure spin current, and therefore
cannot monitor the pure spin current in a real-time and real-space fashion.
This imposes severe constraints on research in this field. Here we demonstrate
a second-order nonlinear optical effect of the pure spin current. We show that
such a nonlinear optical effect, which has never been explored before, can be
used for the non-invasive, non-destructive, and real-time imaging of pure spin
currents. Since this detection scheme does not rely on optical resonances, it
can be generally applied in a wide range of materials with different electronic
bandstructures. Furthermore, the control of nonlinear optical properties of
materials with pure spin currents may have potential applications in photonics
integrated with spintronics.

critical (SOC) system can be looked upon as a Witten-type topological field
theory (W-TFT) with spontaneously broken Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)
symmetry. One of the conditions for the SOC is the slow driving noise, which
unambiguously suggests Stratonovich interpretation of the corresponding
stochastic differential equation (SDE). This, in turn, necessitates the use of
Parisi-Sourlas-Wu stochastic quantization procedure, which straightforwardly
leads to a model with BRST-exact action, i.e., to a W-TFT. In the parameter
space of the SDE, there must exist full-dimensional regions where the
BRST-symmetry is spontaneously broken by instantons, which in the context of
SOC are essentially avalanches. In these regions, the avalanche-type SOC
dynamics is liberated from overwise a rightful dynamics-less W-TFT, and a
Goldstone mode of Fadeev-Popov ghosts exists. Goldstinos represent modulii of
instantons (avalanches) and being gapless are responsible for the critical
avalanche distribution in the low-energy, long-wavelength limit. The above
arguments are robust against moderate variations of the SDE's parameters and
the criticality is ""self-tuned"". The proposition of this paper suggests that
the machinery of W-TFTs may find its applications in many different areas of
modern science studying various physical realizations of SOC. It also suggests
that there may in principle exist a connection between some of SOC's and the
concept of topological quantum computing.

varying the Yukawa couplings entering the Seesaw mechanism. We also show that

search mechanisms in almost all of the PDM systems are not very efficient and
based on old ways of searching information by entering the relevant information
to the respective fields of search forms to find out some specific information
from attached repositories. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was
conducted in fields of PDM Systems and Language Technology. Concerning the PDM
System, conducted research provides the information about PDM and PDM Systems
in detail. Concerning the field of Language Technology, helps in implementing a

research was to support the field of PDM with a new proposition of a conceptual
model for the implementation of natural language based search. The proposed
conceptual model is successfully designed and partially implementation in the
form of a prototype. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept,

discussed in this paper. Implemented prototype is compared with respective

structure of underdoped cuprates. Two distinct classes of electronic states are
observed in both the d-wave superconducting (dSC) and the pseudogap (PG)
phases. The first class consists of the dispersive Bogoliubov quasiparticle
excitations of a homogeneous d-wave superconductor, existing below a lower
energy scale E=Delta0. We find that the Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference
signatures of delocalized Cooper pairing are restricted to a k-space arc which
terminates near the lines connecting k=\pm(pi/a0,0) to k=\pm(pi/a0). This arc
shrinks continuously with decreasing hole density such that Luttinger's theorem
could be satisfied if it represents the front side of a hole-pocket which is
bounded behind by the lines between k=\pm(pi/a0,0) and k=\pm(0,pi/a0). In both
phases the only broken symmetries detected for the |E|<Delta0 states are those
of a d-wave superconductor. The second class of states occurs proximate to the
pseudogap energy scale E=Delta1. Here the non-dispersive electronic structure
breaks the expected 90o-rotational symmetry of electronic structure within each
unit cell, at least down to 180o-rotational symmetry. This Q=0 electronic
symmetry breaking was first detected as an electronic inequivalence at the two
oxygen sites within each unit cell by using a measure of nematic (C2) symmetry.
Incommensurate non-dispersive conductance modulations, locally breaking both
rotational and translational symmetries, coexist with this intra-unit-cell
electronic symmetry breaking at E=Delta1. Their characteristic wavevector Q is
determined by the k-space points where Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference
terminates and therefore changes continuously with doping. The distinct broken
electronic symmetry states (Q=0 and finite Q) coexisting at E~Delta1 are found
to be indistinguishable in the dSC and PG phases.

quantity in cosmology is a most natural one. It is difficult to conceive an
expanding universe with a strictly constant vacuum energy density, namely one
that has remained immutable since the origin of time. A smoothly evolving
vacuum energy density that inherits its time-dependence from cosmological
functions, such as the Hubble rate or the scale factor, is not only a
qualitatively more plausible and intuitive idea, but is also suggested by
fundamental physics, in particular by quantum field theory (QFT) in curved
space-time. To implement this notion, is not strictly necessary to resort to ad
hoc scalar fields, as usually done in the literature (e.g. in quintessence
formulations and the like). A ""running"" Lambda term can be expected on very
similar grounds as one expects (and observes) the running of couplings and
masses with a physical energy scale in QFT. Furthermore, the experimental
evidence that the equation of state of the dark energy could be evolving with
time/redshift (including the possibility that it might currently behave
phantom-like) suggests that a time-variable Lambda term (possibly accompanied
by a variable Newton's gravitational coupling G=G(t)) could account in a
natural way for all these features. Remarkably enough, a class of these models
(the ""new cosmon"") could even be the clue for solving the old cosmological
constant problem, including the coincidence problem.

the mean-field dynamo in a thin disk. We assume a small-scale seed field which
is then amplified by the small-scale turbulent dynamo up to energy
equipartition with kinetic energy of turbulence. The large-scale galactic
dynamo starts from seed fields of 100 pc and an averaged regular field strength

smaller than those derived in the literature for theories with no extra scale.
The gravitational acceleration produced by a HECR in its vicinity is much
higher than the MOND acceleration a0. So, modification to GR, which underlies
L, enters only beyond the MOND radius of the particle, within which GR holds
sway: r_M=sqrt(Gp/c a0). The spectral cutoff, which enters L quadratically, is
thus 1/r_M, not the particle's, much larger, de Broglie wavenumber: k_{dB}=
p/hbar. Thus, L is smaller than published rates, which use k_{dB}, by a factor
(r_M k_{dB})^2~10^{39}(cp/3.10^{11}Gev)^3. With 1/r_M as cutoff, the distance a
HECR can travel without major losses is q l_M, where l_M=c^2/a0 is the MOND
length, and q is a dimensionless function of parameters of the problem. Since
l_M is ~2 pi times the Hubble distance, survival of HECRs does not strongly
constrain GR-compatible, MOND theories. Such theories also easily satisfy
existing preferred-frame limits, inasmuch as these limits are gotten in
high-acceleration systems. I exemplify the results with MOND adaptations of

Because of the possible lack of time-reversibility, the defining properties
(i)--(iii) do not, in general, characterize the covariance structure of OFBMs.
To circumvent this problem, the class of OFBMs is characterized here by means
of their integral representations in the spectral and time domains. For the
spectral domain representations, this involves showing how the operator
self-similarity shapes the spectral density in the general representation of
stationary increment processes. The time domain representations are derived by
using primary matrix functions and taking the Fourier transforms of the
deterministic spectral domain kernels. Necessary and sufficient conditions for
OFBMs to be time-reversible are established in terms of their spectral and time
domain representations. It is also shown that the spectral density of the
stationary increments of an OFBM has a rigid structure, here called the
dichotomy principle. The notion of operator Brownian motions is also explored.

avalanche photodiodes (G-APDs) and pulsed X-ray irradiation. The primary
scintillation yield of the fast component was measured to be 17000 photon/MeV
in gaseous Ar in the NIR, in the range of 690-1000 nm, and 510 photon/MeV in
liquid Ar, in the range of 400-1000 nm. Proportional NIR scintillations
(electroluminescence) in gaseous Ar have been also observed; their
amplification parameter at 163 K was measured to be 13 photons per drifting
electron per kV. Possible applications of NIR scintillations in high energy
physics experiments are discussed.

processes of structure formation in the Universe. About half of this
background, called the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) is emitted in the
8-1000 microns range, and peaks around 150 microns. It is due to the dust
reemission from star formation processes and AGN emission. The CIB spectral
energy distribution (SED) constraints the models of star formation in the
Universe. It is also useful to compute the opacity of the Universe to the TeV
photons.
  We present the different types of measurements of the CIB and discuss their
strengths and weaknesses.
  1. The absolute SED was measured by COBE, and by other experiments. These
measurements are limited by the accuracy of the component separation, i.e. the
foreground subtraction.
  2. Robust lower limits are determined from the extragalactic number counts of
infrared galaxies. These lower limits are very stringent up to 100 microns. At
larger wavelengths, the rather low angular resolution of the instruments limits
strongly the depth of the number counts. The ""stacking"" method determines the
flux emitted at a given wavelength by a population detected at another
wavelength, and provides stringent lower limits in the sub-mm range. It is
complementary with other methods based on the statistical analysis of the map
properties like the P(D) analysis.
  3. Finally, upper limits can be derived from the high energy spectra of
extragalactic sources. These upper limits give currently good constraints in
the near- and mid-IR.
  Progress have been amazing since the CIB discovery about 15 years ago: the
SED is much better known, and most of it can be accounted for by galaxies
(directly or indirectly). Prospects are also exciting, with fluctuation
analysis with Planck&Herschel, and forthcoming missions.

pipeline. Such simulations include both the STEP 1 and 2 simulations, and more
realistic simulations of the distortion of galaxy shapes by a cluster with a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. From such simulations we estimate the effect
of noise on shear measurement and derive the correction terms. The R-band image
is used to derive the mass by fitting the observed tangential shear profile
with a NFW mass profile. Photometric redshifts are computed from the uBVRIz
catalogs. Different methods for the foreground/background galaxy selection are
implemented, namely selection by magnitude, color and photometric redshifts,
and results are compared. In particular, we developed a semi-automatic
algorithm to select the foreground galaxies in the color-color diagram, based
on observed colors. Using color selection or photometric redshifts improves the
correction of dilution from foreground galaxies: this leads to higher signals
in the inner parts of the cluster. We obtain a cluster mass that is ~ 20%
higher than previous estimates, and is more consistent the mass expected from
X--ray data. The R-band luminosity function of the cluster is finally computed.

been developed and applied to study a wide range of model systems as well as
real-world data, e.g., geophysical or financial time series. Among these
techniques, recurrence-based concepts and prominently $\epsilon$-recurrence
networks, most faithfully represent the geometrical fine structure of the
attractors underlying chaotic (and less interestingly non-chaotic) time series.
In this paper we demonstrate that the well known graph theoretical properties
local clustering coefficient and global (network) transitivity can meaningfully
be exploited to define two new local and two new global measures of dimension
in phase space: local upper and lower clustering dimension as well as global
upper and lower transitivity dimension. Rigorous analytical as well as
numerical results for self-similar sets and simple chaotic model systems
suggest that these measures are well-behaved in most non-pathological
situations and that they can be estimated reasonably well using
$\epsilon$-recurrence networks constructed from relatively short time series.
Moreover, we study the relationship between clustering and transitivity
dimensions on the one hand, and traditional measures like pointwise dimension
or local Lyapunov dimension on the other hand. We also provide further evidence
that the local clustering coefficients, or equivalently the local clustering
dimensions, are useful for identifying unstable periodic orbits and other
dynamically invariant objects from time series. Our results demonstrate that
$\epsilon$-recurrence networks exhibit an important link between dynamical
systems and graph theory.

color became bluer when the objects were brighter in these flares. On the other
hand, the color of PKS 1510-089 exhibited a trend that it became redder when it
was brighter, except for its prominent flare. This redder-when-brighter trend
can be explained by the strong contribution of thermal emission from an
accretion disk. The polarization degree increased at the flares, and reached
>25 % at the maxima. We compare these flares in AO 0235+164 and PKS 1510-089
with other short flares which were detected by our monitoring of 41 blazars.
Those two flares had one of the largest variation amplitudes in both flux and

(relativistically corrected) Newtonian theory, is introduced in exact GR as the
volume integral of all the source terms in the field equation for the Newtonian
potential in static spacetimes. In particular, we exhibit a new post-Newtonian
correction in the source term in the field equation for the Newtonian
gravitational potential. In asymptotically flat spacetimes this expression
tends to the ADM energy at the spatial infinity as a {\em monotonically
decreasing} set function. We prove its positivity in spherically symmetric
spacetimes under certain energy conditions, and that its vanishing
characterizes flatness. We argue that any physically acceptable quasi-local
energy expression should behave qualitatively like this `effective' energy
expression in this limit.

stability of nematic and smectic ordering in a suspension of platelets of the
same thickness but with a high polydispersity in diameter, and study the
influence of polydispersity on this stability. The platelets are assumed to
interact like hard objects, but additional soft attractive and repulsive
interactions, meant to represent the effect of depletion interactions are also
considered. The aspect (diameter to thickness) ratio is taken to be very high,
in order to model solutions of mineral platelets recently explored
experimentally. In this regime a high degree of orientational ordering occurs;
therefore the model platelets can be taken as completely parallel and are
amenable to analysis via a fundamental-measure theory. Our focus is on the
nematic vs. smectic phase interplay, since a high degree of polydispersity in
diameter suppresses the formation of the columnar phase. When interactions are
purely hard, the theory predicts a continuous nematic-to-smectic transition,
regardless of the degree of diameter polydispersity. However, polydispersity
enhances the stability of the smectic phase against the nematic phase.
Predictions for the case where an additional soft interaction is added are
obtained using mean-field perturbation theory. In the case of the one-component
fluid, the transition remains continuous for repulsive forces, and the smectic
phase becomes more stable as the range of the interaction is decreased. The
opposite behaviour with respect to the range is observed for attractive forces,
and in fact the transition becomes of first order below a tricritical point.
Also, for attractive interactions, nematic demixing appears, with an associated
critical point. When platelet polydispersity is introduced the tricritical
temperature shifts to very high values.

properties of thick disks formed through minor mergers. We show that the
vertical surface density profile of the post-merger thick disk follows a sech
function and has an excess in the regions far from the disk mid-plane (z>2kpc).
This stellar excess also follows a sech function with a larger scale height
than the main thick disk component, and it is usually dominated by stars from
the primary galaxy. Stars in the excess have a rotational velocity lower than
that of stars in the thick disk, and they may thus be confused with stars in
the inner galactic halo. The thick disk scale height increases with radius and
the rate of its increase is smaller for more gas rich primary galaxies. On the
contrary, the scale height of the stellar excess is independent of both radius
and gas fraction. We also find that the post-merger thick disk has a radial
scale length which is 10-50% larger than that of the thin disk. Two consecutive
mergers have basically the same effect on heating the stellar disk as a single
merger of the same total mass. To investigate how thick disks produced through
secular processes may differ from those produced by minor mergers, we also
simulated gravitationally unstable gas-rich disks. These disks do not produce
either a stellar excess or a ratio of thick to thin disk scale lengths greater
than one. Our simulation results are consistent with observations of the ratio
of thick to thin disk scale lengths of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, and
with the Toomre diagram of the Milky Way. We conclude that minor mergers are a
viable mechanism for the creation of galactic thick disks and investigating
stars at several kpc above the mid-plane of the Milky Way and other galaxies
may provide a quantitative method for studying the minor merger history of
galaxies.

this decomposition follows from the classic \emph{LePage decomposition} of a
(union)-stable point process. Moreover, we give a short proof of it in the
general case of random measures on $\mathbb R$.

Kent","Ologs: a categorical framework for knowledge representation","38 pages",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0024274",,"cs.LO cs.AI math.CT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In this paper we introduce the olog, or ontology log, a category-theoretic
model for knowledge representation (KR). Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs
can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models
(such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database
schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike
database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are
designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is
a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to
author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language,
despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many
examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can
be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected
together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of
information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and
global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future
research.

description of parton evolution at small values of Bjorken x. One of them is
based on the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution equation and
generates fully differential parton distributions in momentum space making use
of reggeized gluons. The other one is based on the
Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) partonic kernel where QCD coherence
effects are introduced. It has been argued that both approaches agree with each
other in the x -> 0 limit. We show that this is not the case for azimuthal
angle dependent quantities since at high energies the BFKL approach is
dominated by its zero conformal spin component while the CCFM gluon Green
function receives contributions from all conformal spins even at very small x.

Bang the Inter Galactic Medium (IGM) underwent a ""phase transformation"" from
cold and fully neutral to warm (~10^4 K) and ionized. Whether this phase
transformation was fully driven and completed by photoionization by young hot
stars is a question of topical interest in cosmology. AIMS. We propose here
that besides the ultraviolet radiation from massive stars, feedback from
accreting black holes in high-mass X-ray binaries (BH-HMXBs) was an additional,
important source of heating and reionization of the IGM in regions of low gas
density at large distances from star-forming galaxies. METHODS. We use current
theoretical models on the formation and evolution of primitive massive stars of
low metallicity, and the observations of compact stellar remnants in the near
and distant universe, to infer that a significant fraction of the first
generations of massive stars end up as BH-HMXBs. The total number of energetic
ionizing photons from an accreting stellar black hole in an HMXB is comparable
to the total number of ionizing photons of its progenitor star. However, the
X-ray photons emitted by the accreting black hole are capable of producing
several secondary ionizations and the ionizing power of the resulting black
hole could be greater than that of its progenitor. Feedback by the large
populations of BH-HMXBs heats the IGM to temperatures of ~10^4 K and maintains
it ionized on large distance scales. BH-HMXBs determine the early thermal
history of the universe and mantain it as ionized over large volumes of space
in regions of low density. This has a direct impact on the properties of the
faintest galaxies at high redshifts, the smallest dwarf galaxies in the local
universe, and on the existing and future surveys at radio wavelengths of atomic
hydrogen in the early universe.

supportive cells. For clinical follow-up, the evaluation of the preoperative
tumor volume is essential. Volumetric assessment of tumor volume with manual
segmentation of its outlines is a time-consuming process that can be overcome
with the help of computerized segmentation methods. In this contribution, two
methods for World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioma segmentation in the
human brain are compared using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patient data
from the clinical routine. One method uses balloon inflation forces, and relies
on detection of high intensity tumor boundaries that are coupled with the use
of contrast agent gadolinium. The other method sets up a directed and weighted
graph and performs a min-cut for optimal segmentation results. The ground truth
of the tumor boundaries - for evaluating the methods on 27 cases - is manually
extracted by neurosurgeons with several years of experience in the resection of
gliomas. A comparison is performed using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC),
a measure for the spatial overlap of different segmentation results.
