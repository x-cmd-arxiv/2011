layers, using first-principles calculation for Au(111) surface. When the slab
of the atomic layers is sufficiently thick, the lower split state has a minimum
away from $\bar{\Gamma}$, which is known as the Rashba effect. As the number of
layers decreases, the minimum approaches $\bar{\Gamma}$, and it is located at
$\bar{\Gamma}$ for $N \leq 14$. This crossover is analyzed in detail using two
models: a tight-binding model and a bilayer nearly-free-electron model. It is
demonstrated that the features of surface band dispersion are clearly
understood as the result of the competition between the interference of the
surface states on both sides and the spin-orbit interaction.

expectation value is solved numerically with high accuracy in Euclidean space
at zero temperature and in the broken symmetry phase of the phi^4 model.
Explicitly finite equations are derived with the adaptation of the
renormalization method of van Hees and Knoll [H. van Hees, J. Knoll, Phys. Rev.
D65, 025010 (2001)] to the case of non-vanishing field expectation value. The
set of renormalization conditions used in this method leads to the same set of
counterterms obtained recently in A. Patkos, Zs. Szep, Nucl. Phys. A811,
329-352 (2008). This makes possible the direct comparison of the accurate
solution of explicitly finite equations with the solution of renormalized
equations containing counterterms. The numerically efficient way of solving
iteratively these latter equations is obtained by deriving at each order of the
iteration new counterterms which evolve during the iteration process towards
the counterterms determined based on the asymptotic behavior of the converged
propagator. As shown at different values of the coupling, the use of these
evolving counterterms accelerates the convergence of the solution of the
equations.

such privacy-preserving data access is possible using a combination of
probabilistic encryption, which directly hides data values, and stateless
oblivious RAM simulation, which hides the pattern of data accesses. We give
simulations that have only an $O(\log n)$ amortized time overhead for
simulating a RAM algorithm, $\cal A$, that has a memory of size $n$, using a
scheme that is data-oblivious with very high probability assuming the
simulation has access to a private workspace of size $O(n^\nu)$, for any given
fixed constant $\nu>0$. This simulation makes use of pseudorandom hash
functions and is based on a novel hierarchy of cuckoo hash tables that all
share a common stash. We also provide results from an experimental simulation
of this scheme, showing its practicality. In addition, in a result that may be
of some theoretical interest, we also show that one can eliminate the
dependence on pseudorandom hash functions in our simulation while having the
overhead rise to be $O(\log^2 n)$.

Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for p_T > 4 GeV/c the anisotropy
for direct photons is consistent with zero, as expected if the dominant source
of direct photons is initial hard scattering. However, in the p_T < 4 GeV/c
region dominated by thermal photons, we find a substantial direct photon v_2
comparable to that of hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons
in this kinematic region significantly underpredict the observed v_2.

  communication protocols","16 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An extended formulation of a polyhedron $P$ is a linear description of a
polyhedron $Q$ together with a linear map $\pi$ such that $\pi(Q)=P$. These
objects are of fundamental importance in polyhedral combinatorics and
optimization theory, and the subject of a number of studies. Yannakakis'
factorization theorem [M. Yannakakis. Expressing combinatorial optimization
problems by linear programs. {\em J. Comput. System Sci.}, 43(3):441--466
(1991)] provides a surprising connection between extended formulations and
communication complexity, showing that the smallest size of an extended
formulation of $P$ equals the nonnegative rank of its slack matrix $S$.
Moreover, Yannakakis also shows that the nonnegative rank of $S$ is at most
$2^c$, where $c$ is the complexity of any \emph{deterministic} protocol
computing $S$. In this paper, we show that the latter result can be
strengthened when we allow protocols to be \emph{randomized}. In particular, we
prove that the base-2 logarithm of the nonnegative rank of any nonnegative
matrix equals the minimum complexity of a randomized communication protocol
computing the matrix in expectation. Using Yannakakis' factorization theorem,
this implies that the base-2 logarithm of the smallest size of an extended
formulation of a polytope $P$ equals the minimum complexity of a randomized
communication protocol computing the slack matrix of $P$ in expectation. We
show that allowing randomization in the protocol can be crucial for obtaining
small extended formulations. Specifically, we prove that for the spanning tree
and perfect matching polytopes, small variance in the protocol forces large
size in the extended formulation.

density of states (DOS), as a function of doping and of the geometrical
parameters determining the width of the structures. The superconducting
correlations are found to penetrate the normal graphene layers even when there
is extreme mismatch in the normal and superconducting doping levels, where
specular Andreev reflection dominates. The local DOS exhibits peculiar
features, which we discuss, arising from the Dirac cone dispersion relation and
from the interplay between the superconducting and Thouless energy scales. The
corresponding characteristic energies emerge in the form of resonant peaks in
the local DOS, that depend strongly on the doping level, as does the energy
gap, which declines sharply as the relative difference in doping between the S
and N regions is reduced. We also linearize the DBdG equations and develop an
essentially analytical method that determines the critical temperature $T_c$ of
an \sns nanostructure self-consistently. We find that for S regions that occupy
a fraction of the coherence length, $T_c$ can undergo substantial variations as
a function of the relative doping. At finite temperatures and by manipulating
the doping levels, the self consistent pair amplitudes reveal dramatic
transitions between a superconducting and resistive normal state of the
structure. Such behavior suggests the possibility of using the proposed system
as a carbon-based superconducting switch, turning superconductivity on or off
by tuning the relative doping levels.

improve the efficiency of multi-hop wireless networks. However, in a stochastic

number of available coding opportunities. In this context, an important
decision is whether to delay packet transmission in hope that a coding pair
will be available in the future or transmit a packet without coding. The paper
addresses this problem by formulating a stochastic dynamic program whose
objective is to minimize the long-run average cost per unit time incurred due
to transmissions and delays. In particular, we identify optimal control actions
that would balance between costs of transmission against the costs incurred due
to the delays. Moreover, we seek to address a crucial question: what should be
observed as the state of the system? We analytically show that observing queue
lengths suffices if the system can be modeled as a Markov decision process. We
also show that a stationary threshold type policy based on queue lengths is
optimal. We further substantiate our results with simulation experiments for

develop three themes related to our basic question: does an element p of A
having zero set containing the intersection of zero sets of elements from a
finite set S of A belong to the smallest real ideal containing S? Firstly, we
construct some general theory which shows that if a canonical topological
closure of certain objects are permitted, then the answer is yes, while at the
purely algebraic level it is no. Secondly for every finite subset S of the free
*-algebra R<x,x*> of polynomials in g indeterminates and their formal adjoints,
we give an implementable algorithm which computes the smallest real ideal
containing S and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a finite number of steps.
Lastly we provide examples of noncommutative real ideals for which a purely
algebraic non-commutative real Nullstellensatz holds. For instance, this
includes the real (left) ideals generated by a finite sets S in the *-algebra
of n by n matrices whose entries are polynomials in one-variable. Further,
explicit sufficient conditions on a left ideal in R<x,x*> are given which cover
all the examples of such ideals of which we are aware and significantly more.

a robust abort capability, and a safe environment for proximity operations -

reveals 15 new gamma Doradus variables (and confirms two others), eight new
delta Scuti variables (and confirms one other), and three new variables with
unresolved periodicity. Of the 114 gamma Doradus candidates in our
volume-limited sample, we find 25 stars that are new or previously-known gamma
Doradus variables. This results in an incidence of 22% for gamma Doradus
variability among candidate field stars for this volume of the solar

stars per 10^3 pc^3 or 94 stars per 10^6 pc^3. We provide an updated list of 86

offer an attractive method for measuring the build-up of cosmological
structure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the Universe and our
theory of gravity. Galaxies occupy dark matter halos, whose redshift space
clustering has a complex dependence on bias that cannot be inferred from the
behavior of matter. We identify two distinct corrections on quasilinear scales
(~ 30-80 Mpc/h): the non-linear mapping between real and redshift space
positions, and the non-linear suppression of power in the velocity divergence
field. We model the first non-perturbatively using the scale-dependent Gaussian
streaming model, which we show is accurate at the <0.5 (2) per cent level in
transforming real space clustering and velocity statistics into redshift space
on scales s>10 (s>25) Mpc/h for the monopole (quadrupole) halo correlation
functions. We use perturbation theory to predict the real space pairwise halo
velocity statistics. Our fully analytic model is accurate at the 2 per cent
level only on scales s > 40 Mpc/h. Recent models that neglect the corrections
from the bispectrum and higher order terms from the non-linear real-to-redshift
space mapping will not have the accuracy required for current and future
observational analyses. Finally, we note that our simulation results confirm
the essential but non-trivial assumption that on large scales, the bias
inferred from real space clustering of halos is the same one that determines
their pairwise infall velocity amplitude at the per cent level.

this problem was known to be NP-hard for k >= 3, the first non-trivial
NP-hardness of approximation factor of k/4- \eps was shown in a recent work by

that at least 18 are genuine BSS. We normalize the BSS population by our

discrepant from that found in stellar clusters. The blue straggler population
of dwarf spheroidals remains a subject of debate; some authors claim an
anticorrelation between the normalised blue straggler fraction and integrated

properties are consistent with the picture that SMM J09431+4700 represents an
early-stage, gas-rich major merger, and that SMM J13120+4242 represents such a

saddle type equilibrium points which are characteristic for reaction type

Using tools from the geometric theory of Hamiltonian systems and their

M$_{\odot}$ (assuming T_{Dust}=20 K). The median HCO+ linewidth is 2.9 km
s$^{-1}$ indicating that BGPS clumps are dominated by supersonic turbulence or
unresolved kinematic motions. We find no evidence for a size-linewidth
relationship for BGPS clumps. We analyze the effects of the assumed dust
temperature on the derived clump properties with a Monte Carlo simulation and
we find that changing the temperature distribution will change the median
source properties (mass, volume-averaged number density, surface density) by
factors of a few. The observed differential mass distribution has a power-law
slope that is intermediate between that observed for diffuse CO clouds and the
stellar IMF. BGPS clumps represent a wide range of objects (from dense cores to
more diffuse clumps) and are typically characterized by larger sizes and lower
densities than previously published surveys of high-mass star-forming regions.
This collection of objects is a less-biased sample of star-forming regions in

on par with local star formation regions of lower mass, they consist of much
more mass which induces very high internal pressures. In order for IRDCs to

confining pressure provided by the high concentration of molecular clouds in
the spiral arm in which they reside. The high molecular concentration and

called ""supertransfer."" In this work we demonstrate how supertransfer effects
induced by geometrical symmetries can enhance the exciton diffusion length by a
factor $n$ along cylindrically symmetric structures, consisting of arrays of
rings of chromophores, and along spiral arrays. We analyse both closed system
dynamics and open quantum dynamics, modelled by combining a random bosonic bath
with static disorder. In the closed system case, we use the symmetries of the
system within a short-time approximation to obtain a closed analytical
expression for the diffusion length that explicitly reveals the supertransfer
contribution. When subject to disorder, we show that supertransfer can enhance
excitonic diffusion lengths for small disorders and characterize the crossover
from coherent to incoherent motion. Owing to the quasi-1D nature of the model,
disorder ultimately localizes the excitons, diminishing but not destroying the
effects of supertransfer. When dephasing effects are included, we study the
scaling of diffusion with both time and number of chromophores and observe that
the transition from a coherent, ballistic regime to an incoherent, random-walk
regime occurs at the same point as the change from supertransfer to classical
scaling.

generalization to the recently developed infinite series models is presented
here. It is shown that one can convert a vortex penetration process with a

flux relaxation process starting with an arbitrary internal field into a
process starting with a melting internal field by introducing a virtual time

current density) from a flux relaxation process starting with a lower internal

Lipschitz map $f:\bR^n\times \bR^m\to\bR^n$ (with $n$-dim. image) can be
precomposed with a bi-Lipschitz map $\bar{g}:\bR^n\times \bR^m\to \bR^n\times
\bR^m$ such that $f\circ \bar{g}$ will satisfy, when we restrict to a large
portion of the domain $E\subset \bR^n\times \bR^m$, that $f\circ \bar{g}$ is
bi-Lipschitz in the first coordinate, and constant in the second coordinate.
Geometrically speaking, the map $\bar{g}$ distorts $\bR^{n+m}$ in a controlled
manner, so that the fibers of $f$ are straightened out. Furthermore, our
results stay valid when the target space is replaced by {\bf any metric space}.
A main point is that our results are quantitative: the size of the set $E$ on
which behavior is good is a significant part of the discussion. Our estimates
are motivated by examples such as Kaufman's 1979 construction of a $C^1$ map
from $[0,1]^3$ onto $[0,1]^2$ with rank $\leq 1$ everywhere.
  On route we prove an extension theorem which is of independent interest. We
show that for any $D\geq n$, any Lipschitz function $f:[0,1]^n\to \bR^D$ gives
rise to a large (in an appropriate sense) subset $E\subset [0,1]^n$ such that
$f|_E$ is bi-Lipschitz and may be extended to a bi-Lipschitz function defined
on {\bf all} of $\bR^n$. The most interesting case is the case $D=n$. As a
simple corollary, we show that $n$-dimensional Ahlfors-David regular spaces
lying in $\bR^{D}$ having big pieces of bi-Lipschitz images also have big

using the Ka-band receiver system on the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA).
Strong detections were obtained in two of them, SDSS J092721.82+200123.7 and
CFHQS J142952.17+544717.6, and a marginal detection was obtained in another
source, SDSS J084035.09+562419.9. Upper limits of the CO (2-1) line emission
have been obtained for the other two objects. The CO (2-1) line detection in
J0927+2001, together with previous measurements of the CO (6-5) and (5-4)
lines, reveals important constraints on the CO excitation in the central ~10
kpc region of the quasar host galaxy. The CO (2-1) line emission from
J1429+5447 is resolved into two distinct peaks separated by 1.2"" (~6.9 kpc),
indicating a possible gas-rich, major merging system, and the optical quasar
position is consistent with the west peak. This result is in good agreement
with the picture in which intense host galaxy star formation is coeval with
rapid supermassive black hole accretion in the most distant universe. The two
EVLA detections are ideal targets for further high-resolution imaging (e.g.,
with ALMA or EVLA observations) to study the gas distribution, dynamics, and
SMBH-bulge mass relation in these earliest quasar-host galaxy systems.

effects and additional forms of energy dissipation. Simulations of the model
are applied to parabolic, wedge and hyperbolic billiards that are driven
sinusoidally. The simulations demonstrate that the parabola has stable,
periodic motion, while the wedge and hyperbola (at high driving frequencies)
appear chaotic. The hyperbola, at low driving frequencies, behaves similarly to
the parabola; i.e., has regular motion. Direct comparisons are made between the

the coefficient of restitution employed in the model resulted in good agreement
with the experimental data for all boundary shapes investigated. It is shown
that the data can be successfully modeled with a simple set of parameters

frequency domain) using algorithms whose complexity does not depend on the size
or shape of the filter. These fast algorithms are generally referred to as
constant-time or O(1) algorithms in the image processing literature. Along with
the spatial filter, the edge-preserving bilateral filter [Tomasi1998] involves
an additional range kernel. This is used to restrict the averaging to those
neighborhood pixels whose intensity are similar or close to that of the pixel
of interest. The range kernel operates by acting on the pixel intensities. This
makes the averaging process non-linear and computationally intensive,
especially when the spatial filter is large. In this paper, we show how the
O(1) averaging algorithms can be leveraged for realizing the bilateral filter
in constant-time, by using trigonometric range kernels. This is done by
generalizing the idea in [Porikli2008] of using polynomial range kernels. The
class of trigonometric kernels turns out to be sufficiently rich, allowing for
the approximation of the standard Gaussian bilateral filter. The attractive
feature of our approach is that, for a fixed number of terms, the quality of
approximation achieved using trigonometric kernels is much superior to that
obtained in [Porikli2008] using polynomials.

The average downlink throughput for such a 2-cell network is derived. The user
location has a strong effect on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and the
channel estimation error. This motivates adaptively switching between
traditional (single-cell) beamforming and ICIC at low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) where ICIC is preferred only with low SIR and accurate channel
estimation, and the use of ICIC with optimized training and feedback at high
SNR. For a given channel coherence time and fixed training and feedback
overheads, we develop optimal data vs. pilot power allocation for CSI training
as well as optimal feedback resource allocation to feed back CSI of different
channels. Both analog and finite-rate digital feedback are considered. With
analog feedback, the training power optimization provides a more significant
performance gain than feedback optimization; while conversely for digital
feedback, performance is more sensitive to the feedback bit allocation than the
training power optimization. We show that even with low-rate feedback and

form the main body of Very special relativity (VSR). They did not mention about
length contraction in VSR. Length contraction in VSR has not been studied at
all. In this article we calculate how the length of a moving rod contracts in
VSR, particularly in the HOM(2) version. The results are interesting in the
sense that in general the length contraction formulas in VSR are different from
SR but in many cases the two theories predict similar length contraction of
moving rods.

been widely acknowledged as the most popular reasoning technique in qualitative
spatial and temporal reasoning. Given a qualitative calculus (i.e. a relation
model), the first thing we should do is to establish its composition table
(CT). In the past three decades, such work is usually done manually. This is
undesirable and error-prone, given that the calculus may contain tens or
hundreds of basic relations. Computing the correct CT has been identified by
Tony Cohn as a challenge for computer scientists in 1995. This paper addresses
this problem and introduces a semi-automatic method to compute the CT by
randomly generating triples of elements. For several important qualitative
calculi, our method can establish the correct CT in a reasonable short time.
This is illustrated by applications to the Interval Algebra, the Region
Connection Calculus RCC-8, the INDU calculus, and the Oriented Point Relation
Algebras. Our method can also be used to generate CTs for customised
qualitative calculi defined on restricted domains.

the perturbative theory which works when the cavity wall begins to move at time

In a concentrated solution of rodlike polymers, the rotational diffusion

constraints of the surrounding polymers, so that the rodlike molecules diffuse
only along their rod directions. In the early stage of phase transition, the
rodlike polymers with nearly parallel orientations assemble to form a nematic
polydomain. This polydomain pattern with characteristic length l, grows with
self-similarity in three dimensions (3D) over time with a l~1/4 scaling law. In
the late stage, the rotational diffusion becomes significant, leading a
crossover of the growth exponent from 1/4 to 1/2. This crossover time is
estimated to be of the order t~1/Dr. We also examined time evolution of a pair
of disclinations placed in a confined system, by solving the same
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations in two dimensions (2D). If the initial
distance between the disclinations is shorter than some critical length, they

phase-space. We also find that the space defined by the energy and angular
momentum of stars is a better choice than velocity space, as clumps remain
visible even in large local volumes. This makes their observational detection
much easier since one need not be restricted to a small spatial volume. We show
that information about the time of impact, the mass of the perturber, and its
trajectory is stored in the kinematics of disc stars.

during the epoch of reionization. The evolution of the LAE luminosity function
with redshift is a direct probe of the Ly-alpha transmission of the
intergalactic medium (IGM), and therefore of the IGM neutral-hydrogen fraction.
Measuring the Ly-alpha luminosity function (LF) of LAEs at redshift z = 7.7
therefore allows us to constrain the ionizing state of the Universe at this
redshift.
  Methods. We observed three 7.5'x7.5' fields with the HAWK-I instrument at the
VLT with a narrow band filter centred at 1.06 $\mu$m and targeting LAEs at
redshift z ~ 7.7. The fields were chosen for the availability of
multiwavelength data. One field is a galaxy cluster, the Bullet Cluster, which
allowed us to use gravitational amplification to probe luminosities that are
fainter than in the field. The two other fields are subareas of the GOODS
Chandra Deep Field South and CFHTLS-D4 deep field. We selected z=7.7 LAE
candidates from a variety of colour criteria, in particular from the absence of
detection in the optical bands.
  Results. We do not find any LAE candidates at z = 7.7 in ~2.4 x 10^4 Mpc^3
down to a narrow band AB magnitude of ~ 26, which allows us to infer robust
constraints on the Ly-alpha LAE luminosity function at this redshift.
  Conclusions. The predicted mean number of objects at z = 6.5, derived from
somewhat different LFs of Hu et al. (2010), Ouchi et al. (2010), and Kashikawa
et al. (2011) are 2.5, 13.7, and 11.6, respectively. Depending on which of
these LFs we refer to, we exclude a scenario with no evolution from z = 6.5 to
z = 7.7 at 85% confidence without requiring a strong change in the IGM Ly-alpha
transmission, or at 99% confidence with a significant quenching of the IGM
Ly-alpha transmission, possibly from a strong increase in the high
neutral-hydrogen fraction between these two redshifts.

oscillations, which can be understood through a resonant amplification
mechanism for density fluctuations. In Monte Carlo simulations of spatial
stochastic predator-prey systems, one observes striking complex spatio-temporal
structures. These spreading activity fronts induce persistent correlations
between predators and prey. In the presence of local particle density
restrictions (finite prey carrying capacity), there exists an extinction
threshold for the predator population. The accompanying continuous
non-equilibrium phase transition is governed by the directed-percolation
universality class. We employ field-theoretic methods based on the Doi-Peliti

following the kinematic approach, in which a horizon is defined as the surface
at which massless test particles are infinitely redshifted. Because of the
nonrelativistic dispersion relations, the speed of light is unlimited, and test
particles do not follow geodesics. As a result, there are significant
differences in causal structures and black holes between general relativity
(GR) and the HL theory. In particular, the horizon radii generically depend on
the energies of test particles. Applying them to the spherical static vacuum
solutions found recently in the nonrelativistic general covariant theory of
gravity, we find that, for test particles with sufficiently high energy, the
radius of the horizon can be made as small as desired, although the
singularities can be seen in principle only by observers with infinitely high
energy. In these studies, we pay particular attention to the global structure
of the solutions, and find that, because of the

quite different from the corresponding ones given in GR, even though the
solutions are the same. In particular, the ${Diff}(M,{\cal{F}})$ does not allow
Penrose diagrams. Among the vacuum solutions, some give rise to the structure
of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, in which two asymptotically flat regions are
connected by a throat with a finite non-zero radius. We also study slowly
rotating solutions in such a setup, and obtain all the solutions characterized
by an arbitrary function $A_{0}(r)$. The case $A_{0} = 0$ reduces to the slowly
rotating Kerr solution obtained in GR.

  issue of Physical Communication on ""Network Coding and Its Application to
  Wireless Communications""",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of physical-layer network coding (PNC) was proposed in 2006 for
application in wireless networks. Since then it has developed into a subfield
of network coding with wide followings. The basic idea of PNC is to exploit the
network coding operation that occurs naturally when electromagnetic (EM) waves
are superimposed on one another. This simple idea turns out to have profound
and fundamental ramifications. Subsequent works by various researchers have led
to many new results in the domains of 1) wireless communication; 2) wireless
information theory; and 3) wireless networking. The purpose of this paper is
fourfold. First, we give a brief tutorial on the basic concept of PNC. Second,
we survey and discuss recent key results in the three aforementioned areas.
Third, we examine a critical issue in PNC: synchronization. It has been a
common belief that PNC requires tight synchronization. Our recent results
suggest, however, that PNC may actually benefit from asynchrony. Fourth, we
propose that PNC is not just for wireless networks; it can also be useful in
optical networks. We provide an example showing that the throughput of a
passive optical network (PON) could potentially be raised by 100% with PNC.

its gradient describes the manner in which one may alter properties of the
system to march towards a stationary point. The adjoint method, arising from
partial-differential-equation-constrained optimization, describes a means of
extracting derivatives of a misfit function with respect to model parameters
through finite computation. It relies on the accurate calculation of wavefields
that are driven by two types of sources, namely the average wave-excitation
spectrum, resulting in the {\it forward wavefield}, and differences between
predictions and observations, resulting in an {\it adjoint wavefield}. All
sensitivity kernels relevant to a given measurement emerge directly from the
evaluation of an interaction integral involving these wavefields. The technique
facilitates computation of sensitivity kernels (Fr\'{e}chet derivatives)
relative to three-dimensional heterogeneous background models, thereby paving
the way for non-linear iterative inversions. An algorithm to perform such
inversions using as many observations as desired is discussed.

was measured on a single crystal sample with a residual resistivity ratio of
~650, with an onset Tc determined by specific heat of 3.7 K. The zero field
normal state specific heat divided by temperature, C/T, was extrapolated from
above Tc to T=0 by insisting on agreement between the extrapolated normal state
entropy at Tc, Sn(Tc), and the measured superconducting state entropy at Tc,
Ss(Tc), since for a second order phase transition the two entropies must be
equal. This extrapolation would indicate that this rather clean sample of
KFe2As2 exhibits non-Fermi liquid behavior, i. e. C/T increases at low
temperatures, in agreement with the reported non-Fermi liquid behavior in the
resistivity. However, specific heat as a function of magnetic field shows that
the shoulder feature around 0.7 K, which is commonly seen in KFe2As2 samples,
is not evidence for a second superconducting gap as has been previously
proposed but instead is due to an unknown magnetic impurity phase, which can
affect the entropy balance and the extrapolation of the normal state specific
heat. This peak (somewhat larger in magnitude) with similar field dependence is
also found in a less pure sample of KFe2As2, with a residual resistivity ratio
of only 90 and an onset Tc=3.1 K. These data, combined with the measured normal
state specific heat in field to suppress superconductivity, allow the
conclusion that an increase in the normal state specific heat as T->0 is in
fact not seen in KFe2As2, i. e. Fermi liquid behavior is observed.

correlation patterns of void spaces in rough fractures (crack type II) was
developed. We characterized friction networks with several networks
characteristics. The correlation among network properties with the fracture
permeability is the result of friction networks. The revealed hubs in the
complex aperture networks confirmed the importance of highly correlated groups
to conduct the highlighted features of the dynamical aperture field. We found
that there is a universal power law between the nodes' degree and motifs
frequency (for triangles it reads T(k)\proptok{\beta} ({\beta}
\approx2\pm0.3)). The investigation of localization effects on eigenvectors
shows a remarkable difference in parallel and perpendicular aperture patches.
Furthermore, we estimate the rate of stored energy in asperities so that we
found that the rate of radiated energy is higher in parallel friction networks
than it is in transverse directions. The final part of our research highlights
4 point sub-graph distribution and its correlation with fluid flow. For shear
rupture, we observed a similar trend in sub-graph distribution, resulting from
parallel and transversal aperture profiles (a superfamily phenomenon).
