introduced which maps the general non-classical (multipartite) correlations
between given systems into bipartite entanglement between the systems and local
ancillae by means of a potentially highly entangling interaction. Here, we
study how this activation protocol can be used to entangle the starting systems
themselves via entanglement swapping through a measurement on the ancillae.
Furthermore, we bound the relative entropy of quantumness (a naturally arising
measure of non-classicality in the scheme of Piani et al. above) for a special
class of separable states, the so-called classical-quantum states. In
particular, we fully characterize the classical-quantum two-qubit states that
are maximally non-classical.

flux-selected galaxy sample. We study the anisotropic distortion by dust
extinction to the 3D galaxy correlation function, including magnification bias
and redshift distortion at the same time. We find the extinction distortion is
most significant along the line of sight and at large separations, similar to
that by magnification bias. The correction from dust extinction is negative
except at sufficiently large transverse separations, which is almost always
opposite to that from magnification bias (we consider a number count slope s >
0.4). Hence, the distortions from these two effects tend to reduce each other.
At low z (~<1), the distortion by extinction is stronger than that by
magnification bias, but at high z, the reverse holds. We also study how dust
extinction affects probes in real space of the baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) and the linear redshift distortion parameter beta. We find its effect on
BAO is negligible. However, it introduces a positive scale-dependent correction
to beta that can be as large as a few percent. At the same time, we also find a
negative scale-dependent correction from magnification bias, which is up to
percent level at low z, but to ~40% at high z. These corrections are
non-negligible for precision cosmology, and should be considered when testing
General Relativity through the scale-dependence of beta.

understanding of the underlying structures in complex data sets. For instance,
in restaurant recommendation systems, recommendations can be based on rating
histories of customers. In addition to rating histories, customers' social
networks (e.g., Facebook friendships) and restaurant categories information
(e.g., Thai or Italian) can also be used to make better recommendations. The
task of fusing data, however, is challenging since data sets can be incomplete
and heterogeneous, i.e., data consist of both matrices, e.g., the person by
person social network matrix or the restaurant by category matrix, and
higher-order tensors, e.g., the ""ratings"" tensor of the form restaurant by meal
by person.
  In this paper, we are particularly interested in fusing data sets with the
goal of capturing their underlying latent structures. We formulate this problem
as a coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) problem where heterogeneous
data sets are modeled by fitting outer-product models to higher-order tensors
and matrices in a coupled manner. Unlike traditional approaches solving this
problem using alternating algorithms, we propose an all-at-once optimization
approach called CMTF-OPT (CMTF-OPTimization), which is a gradient-based
optimization approach for joint analysis of matrices and higher-order tensors.
We also extend the algorithm to handle coupled incomplete data sets. Using
numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed all-at-once approach is
more accurate than the alternating least squares approach.

one disease and dominance of the other as a function of their relative rates of

stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of growth, dependence that
decreases with increasing network size, but does so sufficiently slowly as
still to be easily visible in systems with millions or billions of individuals.

capacity (the number of bits it can transmit in a unit of time) might be
unbounded: (1) Infinitely many choices of signal strength at any given instant
of time, and (2) Infinitely many instances of time at which signals may be
sent. However channel noise cancels out the potential unboundedness of the
first aspect, leaving typical channels with only a finite capacity per instant
of time. The latter source of infinity seems less studied. A potential source
of unreliability that might restrict the capacity also from the second aspect
is delay: Signals transmitted by the sender at a given point of time may not be
received with a predictable delay at the receiving end. Here we examine this
source of uncertainty by considering a simple discrete model of delay errors.
In our model the communicating parties get to subdivide time as microscopically
finely as they wish, but still have to cope with communication delays that are
macroscopic and variable. The continuous process becomes the limit of our
process as the time subdivision becomes infinitesimal. We taxonomize this class
of communication channels based on whether the delays and noise are stochastic
or adversarial; and based on how much information each aspect has about the
other when introducing its errors. We analyze the limits of such channels and
reach somewhat surprising conclusions: The capacity of a physical channel is
finitely bounded only if at least one of the two sources of error (signal noise
or delay noise) is adversarial. In particular the capacity is finitely bounded
only if the delay is adversarial, or the noise is adversarial and acts with
knowledge of the stochastic delay. If both error sources are stochastic, or if
the noise is adversarial and independent of the stochastic delay, then the
capacity of the associated physical channel is infinite.

Fourier series that lack uniform convergence and suffer from the Gibbs
phenomenon. However, they can be represented accurately by a Fourier series
that is periodic on a larger interval. This is commonly called a Fourier
extension. When constructed in a particular manner, Fourier extensions share
many of the same features of a standard Fourier series. In particular, one can
compute Fourier extensions which converge spectrally fast whenever the function
is smooth, and exponentially fast if the function is analytic, much the same as
the Fourier series of a smooth/analytic and periodic function.
  With this in mind, the purpose of this paper is to describe, analyze and
explain the observation that Fourier extensions, much like classical Fourier
series, also have excellent resolution properties for representing oscillatory
functions. The resolution power, or required number of degrees of freedom per
wavelength, depends on a user-controlled parameter and, as we show, it varies
between 2 and \pi. The former value is optimal and is achieved by classical
Fourier series for periodic functions, for example. The latter value is the
resolution power of algebraic polynomial approximations. Thus, Fourier
extensions with an appropriate choice of parameter are eminently suitable for
problems with moderate to high degrees of oscillation.

theory, based on coupled orientational order parameters for the liquid crystal

theories, it involves an expansion of the free energy in powers of the order
parameters, and hence it overestimates the order parameters that occur in the
low-temperature phase. For that reason, we now develop a new Maier-Saupe-type
model, which explicitly shows the low-temperature saturation of the order
parameters. This model reduces to the Landau theory in the limit of high
temperature or weak coupling, but shows different behavior in the opposite
limit. We compare these calculations with experimental results on ferroelectric

associated with wavelet analysis, wavelet representations, but our framework is
wider and has applications to multi-scale expansions arising in dynamical
systems theory for non-invertible endomorphisms.
  Our main results offer a direct integral decomposition for the general
wavelet representation, and we solve a question posed by Judith Packer. This
entails a direct integral decomposition of the general wavelet representation.
We further give a detailed analysis of the measures contributing to the
decomposition into irreducible representations. We prove results for associated
Martin boundaries, relevant for the understanding of wavelet filters and
induced random-walks, as well as classes of harmonic functions.
  Our setting entails representations built from certain finite-to-one
endomorphisms $r$ in compact metric spaces $X$, and we study their dilations to
automorphisms in induced solenoids. Our wavelet representations are covariant
systems formed from the dilated automorphisms. They depend on assigned measures
$\mu$ on $X$. It is known that when the data $(X, r, \mu)$ are given the
associated wavelet representation is typically reducible. By introducing
wavelet filters associated to $(X, r)$ we build random walks in $X$, path-space
measures, harmonic functions, and an associated Martin boundary.
  We construct measures on the solenoid $(X_\infty, r_\infty)$, built from $(X,
r)$. We show that $r_\infty$ induces unitary operators $U$ on Hilbert space
$\H$ and representations $\pi$ of the algebra $L^\infty(X)$ such that the pair
$(U, r_\infty)$, together with the corresponding representation $\pi$ forms a
cross-product in the sense of $C^*$-algebras. We note that the traditional
wavelet representations fall within this wider framework of $(\H, U, \pi)$
covariant crossed products.

well-described as a homogeneous, isotropic FRW cosmology with a dark energy.
Does the formation of nonlinear cosmic inhomogeneities produce a significant
effect on the average large-scale FLRW dynamics? As an answer, we suggest that
if the length scale at which homogeneity sets in is much smaller than the
Hubble length scale, the back-reaction due to averaging over inhomogeneities is
negligible. This result is supported by more than one approach to study of
averaging in cosmology. Even if no single approach is sufficiently rigorous and
compelling, they are all in agreement that the effect of averaging in the real
Universe is small. On the other hand, it is perhaps fair to say that there is
no definitive observational evidence yet that there indeed is a homogeneity
scale which is much smaller than the Hubble scale, or for that matter, if
today's Universe is indeed homogeneous on large scales. If the Copernican
principle can be observationally established to hold, or is theoretically
assumed to be valid, this provides strong evidence for homogeneity on large
scales. However, even this by itself does not say what the scale of homogeneity
is. If that scale is today comparable to the Hubble radius, only a fully
non-perturbative analysis can establish or rule out the importance of
cosmological back-reaction. This brief elementary report summarizes some recent
theoretical developments on which the above inferences are based.

the aim here is to derive the production rates for these singly- and

charge transfer, and molecular reactions. The theory is illustrated by
calculations of the abundances of eleven of the most cosmically abundant heavy
elements in a model of a typical T Tauri star disk. The physical properties of
the gas are determined with an X-ray irradiated thermal-chemical model, which
shows that the disk atmosphere consists of a hot atmosphere overlaying the
mainly cool body of the disk. There is a warm transition layer where hydrogen,
carbon and oxygen are transformed from atomic to molecular species and the
ionization drops by several orders of magnitude. The doubly charged ions are
then largely confined to the hot outer layers of the disk. The nature of the
dominant ions below the transition depends sensitively on the poorly
constrained abundances of the heavy elements. Observational consequences and
connections with the active layers of the magneto-rotational instability are

Then, we computed the total optical depth along each line of sight to obtain
the emission from the whole configuration. Results. Here, we present
predictions of the free-free emission at radio frequencies from analytic,
radiative shock models in colliding wind binaries. It is shown that the
emission from the wind collision region mainly arises from the optically thick
region of the compressed layer and scales as ~ D^{4/5}, where D is the binary
separation. The predicted flux density from the wind collision region becomes
more important as the frequency increases, showing higher spectral indices than
the expected 0.6 value from the unshocked winds. We also investigate the
emission from short-period WR+O systems calculated with our analytic
formulation. In particular, we apply the model to the binary systems WR 98 and
WR 113 and compare our results with the observations. Our theoretical results
are in good agreement with the observed thermal spectra from these sources.

availability of web resources referenced from papers in scholarly repositories.
Two repositories with different characteristics, arXiv and the UNT digital
library, are studied to determine if the nature of the repository, or of its
content, has a bearing on the availability of the web resources cited by that
content. Memento makes it possible to automate discovery of archived resources
and to consider the time between the publication of the research and the
archiving of the referenced URLs. This automation allows us to process more
than 160000 URLs, the largest known such study, and the repository metadata
allows consideration of the results by discipline. The results are startling:
45% (66096) of the URLs referenced from arXiv still exist, but are not
preserved for future generations, and 28% of resources referenced by UNT papers
have been lost. Moving forwards, we provide some initial recommendations,
including that repositories should publish URL lists extracted from papers that
could be used as seeds for web archiving systems.

curve, which is an operator that takes regular curves in R^2 to curves in R^2.
This operator turned out to be very useful to describe helicoidal surfaces, for
example, it provides an interpretation for the profile curve of helicoidal
surfaces with constant mean curvature similar to the well known interpretation
of the profile curve of Delaunay's surfaces using conics. Recentely, Palmer and
Kuhns used the TreadmillSled to classify all helicoidal surfaces with constant
anisotropic mean curvature coming from axially symmetric anisotropic energy
density. Also the author proved that an helicoidal surface different from a
cylinder has constant Gauss curvature if and only if the TreadmillSled of its
profile curve lies in a vertical semi line contained in the lower or upper half
plane and not contained in the y-axis... Why not the whole vertical line? and
why the semi-line cannot be contained in the y-axis? In this paper we provide
several properties of the TreadmillSled operator, in particular we will answer
the questions in the previous sentence. Finally, we prove that the
TreadmillSled of the profile curve of a minimal helicoidal surface is either a
hyperbola or a the x-axis. The latter case occurs only when the surface is a
helicoid.

our derivation is that it leads to an efficient method for updating the
barycentric weights. If an additional derivative is prescribed at one of the
interpolation points, we show how to update the barycentric coefficients using
only $\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)$ operations. Even in the context of confluent
Newton series, a comparably efficient and general method to update the
coefficients appears not to be known. If the method is properly implemented, it
computes the barycentric weights with fewer operations than other methods and
has very good numerical stability even when derivatives of high order are
involved. We give a partial explanation of its numerical stability.

supernovae SNe Ia from the HST Cluster Supernova Survey. The SNe Ia were
discovered over the redshift interval 0.623 < z < 1.415. Fourteen of these SNe
Ia pass our strict selection cuts and are used in combination with the world's
sample of SNe Ia to derive the best current constraints on dark energy. Ten of
our new SNe Ia are beyond redshift $z=1$, thereby nearly doubling the
statistical weight of HST-discovered SNe Ia beyond this redshift. Our detailed
analysis corrects for the recently identified correlation between SN Ia
luminosity and host galaxy mass and corrects the NICMOS zeropoint at the count
rates appropriate for very distant SNe Ia. Adding these supernovae improves the

theory to the counting of orbifolds of toric Calabi-Yau singularities, with
particular attention to Abelian orbifolds of C^D. By doing so, the work
introduces a novel analytical method for counting Abelian orbifolds, verifying
previous algorithm results. One identifies a p-fold cover of the torus T^{D-1}
with an Abelian orbifold of the form C^D/Z_p, for any dimension D and a prime
number p. The counting problem leads to polynomial equations modulo p for a
given Abelian subgroup of S_D, the group of discrete symmetries of the toric
diagram for C^D. The roots of the polynomial equations correspond to orbifolds
of the form C^D/Z_p, which are invariant under the corresponding subgroup of
S_Ds. In turn, invariance under this subgroup implies a discrete symmetry for
the corresponding quiver gauge theory, as is clearly seen by its brane tiling
formulation.

model with a photon index of 1.92 (-0.17+0.13) (-0.06+0.04), where the first

with the synchrotron radio photon index, 1.95 +- 0.01 in 326 -- 608.5 MHz,
ensures that the excess X-ray emission is attributed to the inverse Compton
emission from the synchrotron-radiating electrons, boosting up the cosmic
microwave background photons. From the X-ray flux density, 51.5 +-3.9

fitting globular cluster (GC) velocities and a stellar density profile. The
X-ray mass distributions are similar in the central region but have varying
outer slopes, while the GC mass profile is higher in the central region and on
the upper end of the range further out. Our models cannot differentiate between
the potentials in the central region, and therefore if non-thermal pressures or
multi-phase components are present in the hot gas, they must be smaller than
previously inferred. In the halo, we find that the PN velocities are sensitive
tracers of the mass, preferring a less massive halo than that derived from the
GC mass profile, but similar to one of the mass distributions derived from
X-rays. Our results show that the GCs may form a dynamically distinct system,
and that the properties of the hot gas derived from X-rays in the outer halo
have considerable uncertainties that need to be better understood. Estimating
the mass in stars using photometric information and a stellar population
mass-to-light ratio, we infer a dark matter mass fraction in NGC 4649 of ~0.39

isotropic to mildly radial in the central ~6 kpc depending on the potential
assumed. Further out, the orbital structure becomes slightly more radial along

medium of thermalized quarks, or the source term, is evaluated in perturbative
thermal field theory. The calculation is performed by directly evaluating the
thermal expectation value of the quark energy-momentum tensor. The fast parton
is coupled to the medium by adding an interaction term to the Lagrangian. I
show that this approach is very general and can be modified to consider more
realistic modeling of fast parton propagation, such as a fast parton created in
an initial hard interaction or the evolution of a parton shower due to medium
induced radiation. For the scenario considered here, it is found that local
excitations fall sharply as a function of the energy of the fast parton. These
local excitations couple directly to the sound mode in hydrodynamics and are
important for generating an observable shockwave structure. This may have
implications for the trigger pT dependence of measurements of azimuthal
dihadron particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions. In particular, one
would be less likely to observe a conical emission pattern for increasing
trigger pT.

that native point defects are charged, and each defect is stable in one charge
state only. Removing electrons from the stable defects always generates defect
complexes containing small hole polarons. Defect formation energies, hence
concentrations, and defect energy landscapes are all sensitive to the choice of
atomic chemical potentials which represent experimental conditions. One can,
therefore, suppress or enhance certain native defects in LiFePO4 via tuning the

between dissimilar elastic materials is weak so that the interface is a
preferential path for the crack. The perturbation analysis is made possible by
means of the fundamental solutions (symmetric and skew-symmetric weight
functions) derived in Piccolroaz et al. (2009). We derive the dipole matrices
of the defects in question and use the corresponding dipole fields to evaluate
effective tractions along the crack faces and interface to describe the
interaction between the main interfacial crack and the defects. For a stable
propagation of the crack, the perturbation of the stress intensity factor
induced by the defects is then balanced by the elongation of the crack along
the interface, thus giving an explicit asymptotic formula for the calculation
of the crack advance. The method is general and applicable to interfacial
cracks with general distributed loading on the crack faces, taking into account
possible asymmetry in the boundary conditions. The analytical results are used
to analyse the shielding and amplification effects of various types of defects
in different configurations. Numerical computations based on the explicit
analytical formulae allows for the analysis of crack propagation and arrest.

for graphene flakes, yet a unified understanding of their relative stability

framework based on isotropic elastic plate theory to chart out the
morphological stability space of suspended nanoribbons with respect to
intrinsic (ribbon elasticity) and engineered (ribbon geometry) parameters, and
the combination of edge and body actuation. The computations highlight a rich
morphological shape space that can be naturally classified into two competing
shapes, bending-like and twist-like, depending on the distribution of ripples
across the interacting edges. The linearized elastic framework yields exact
solutions for these rippled shapes. For compressive edge stresses, the body
strain emerges as a key variable that controls their relative stability and in
extreme cases stabilizes co-existing transverse ripples. Tensile edge stresses
lead to dimples within the ribbon core that decay into the edges, a feature of
obvious significance for stretchable nanoelectronics. The interplay between
geometry and mechanics that we report should serve as a key input for
quantifying the transport along these ribbons.

Helix nebula, the H2 emission is produced inside cometary knots (CKs),
comet-shaped structures believed to be clumps of dense neutral gas embedded
within the ionised gas. Most of the H2 emission of the CKs seems to be produced
in a thin layer between the ionised diffuse gas and the neutral material of the
knot, in a mini photodissociation region (PDR). However, PDR models published
so far cannot fully explain all the characteristics of the H2 emission of the

the H2 emission of the CKs, particularly that produced in the interface H^+/H^0

be produced. Our results show that the production of molecular hydrogen in such

particularly the high excitation temperature of the H2 infrared lines. We find
that the temperature derived from H2 observations even of a single knot, will
depend very strongly on the observed transitions, with much higher temperatures
derived from excited levels. We also proposed that the separation between the
H_alpha and NII peak emission observed in the images of CKs may be an effect of
the distance of the knot from the star, since for knots farther from the
central star the NII line is produced closer to the border of the CK than
H_alpha.

The theoretical HXR and MW emissions were calculated by using the distribution
functions of electron beams found by solving time-dependent Fokker-Planck
approach in a converging magnetic field (Zharkova at al., 2010; Kuznetsov and
Zharkova, 2010) for anisotropic scattering of beam electrons on the ambient

fit by those simulated from FP models which include the effects of electric
field induced by beam electrons and precipitation into a converging magnetic
loop. Magnetic field strengths in the footpoints on the photosphere were
updated with newly calibrated SOHO/MDI data. The observed HXR energy spectrum
above 10 keV is shown to be a double power law which was fit precisely by the
photon HXR spectrum simulated for the model including the self-induced electric
field but without magnetic convergence. The MW emission simulated for different

  Our calculations of the SZ effect include relativistic corrections considered
within the framework of the Wright formalism and use a decomposition technique
of electron DFs into Fourier series. Using multi-frequency measurements of the
SZ effect, we find the solution of a linear system of equations that is used to
derive the Fourier coefficients; we further analyze different frequency samples

Maxwell-Bolzman DF as well as from a Juttner DF with the second electron
population by means of SZ observations for the best frequency sample if the
precision of SZ intensity measurements is less than 0.1%. We demonstrate by
means of 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations of a hot merging galaxy cluster
that the morphologies of SZ intensity maps are different for frequencies
$\nu$=375, 600, 700, 857 GHz. We stress that measurements of SZ intensities at
these frequencies are a promising tool for studying electron distribution
functions in galaxy clusters.

obtained by a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation revealing the existence of a

renormalizes the antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling producing an exponential

The observed difference indicates that the quasar environment has a significant

we have constructed a semi-analytic model to simulate the effect of a luminous
quasar on nearby Ly-alpha emitters. We find the null detection around PKS

the quasar may be suppressing the star formation in nearby galaxies. Our study
illustrates that low redshift quasar environments may serve as a surrogate for
studying the radiative suppression of galaxy formation during the epoch of

there is an inherent tradeoff between training overhead and the amount of

independent Rayleigh distributed channel gains, where the parameters to be
optimized are the number of users considered for transmission in each block and
the corresponding time and power spent on training by each user. We derive
closed form expressions for the optimal parameters in terms K and L, where K is
the number of users considered for transmission in each block and L is the
block length in symbols. Considering the behavior of the system as L grows
large, we optimize K with respect to an approximate expression for the

results obtained with the upgraded Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).
The 16-fold increase in observing bandwidth, from 2 x 128 MHz to 2 x 2048 MHz,
high bit sampling, and addition of 16 zoom windows (each divided into a further
2048 channels) provide major improvements for all ATCA observations. The
benefits of the new system are: (1) hugely increased radio continuum and
polarization sensitivity as well as image fidelity, (2) substantially improved
capability to search for and map emission and absorption lines over large
velocity ranges, (3) simultaneous multi-line and continuum observations, (4)
increased sensitivity, survey speed and dynamic range due to high-bit sampling,
and (5) high velocity resolution, while maintaining full polarization output.
The new CABB system encourages all observers to make use of both spectral line
and continuum data to achieve their full potential.
  Given the dramatic increase of the ATCA capabilities in all bands (ranging
from 1.1 to 105 GHz) CABB enables scientific projects that were not feasible
before the upgrade, such as simultaneous observations of multiple spectral
lines, on-the-fly mapping, fast follow-up of radio transients (e.g., the radio
afterglow of new supernovae) and maser observations at high velocity resolution
and full polarization. The first science results presented here include
wide-band spectra, high dynamic-range images, and polarization measurements,
highlighting the increased capability and discovery potential of the ATCA.

the anatomical resolution of organs as a function of time post-injection.
Importantly, PCA was able to discriminate organs such as the pancreas which
could not be resolved from real-time raw images. Tissue phantom studies were
performed to compare imaging in the NIR II region to the traditional NIR I
biological transparency window (700- 900 nm). Examination of the feature sizes
of a common NIR I dye (indocyanine green, ICG) showed a more rapid loss of

SWNTs in the NIR II region. The effects of increased scattering in the NIR I

metals, which are generally measured from associated X-ray emission lines
assuming that they are from the thermal emission of the outflowing hot gas.
Such line emission, however, can also arise from the charge exchange X-ray
emission (CXE) between highly ionized ions and neutral species. To understand
the feedback of energy and metals, it is crucial to determine the origin of the
X-ray emission lines and to distinguish the contributions from the CXE and the
thermal emission. The origin of the lines can be diagnosed by the K{\alpha}
triplets of He-like ions, because the CXE favors the inter-combination and
forbidden lines, while the thermal emission favors the resonance line. We
analyze the triplets of O VII, Ne IX, and Mg XI observed in the XMM- Newton
reflection grating spectra of the starburst galaxy M82. The flux contribution
of the CXE is 90%, 50%, and 30% to the O VII, Ne IX, and Mg XI triplet,
respectively. Averaged over all the three triplets, the contribution of the CXE
is \sim 50% of the total observed triplet flux. To correctly understand the hot
outflow of starburst galaxies, it is necessary to include the CXE. Based on the
measured CXE contributions to the O VII, Ne IX, and Mg XI triplets, we estimate
the relative abundances of O, Ne, and Mg of the outflow and find they are
similar to the solar ratios.

associated with orbit-crowding region, is resolved into two
physically/kinematically distinct features in the 1.5x1.0 (105x70 pc) 12CO(J =

higher surface gas density, and lower star formation rate, while the narrow
line clumps associated with the starburst ring have opposite characteristics.
Toomre-Q value under unity at the radius of the ring suggests that the
molecular ring is gravitationally unstable to fragment at the scale of the GMA.
The line widths and surface density of gas mass of the clumps show an azimuthal
variation related to the large scale dynamics. The star formation rate, on the
other hand, is not significantly affected by the dynamics, but has a
correlation with the intensity ratio of 12CO (J = 3-2) and 12CO(J = 2-1), which

flaring activity and strong aperiodic variability on time scales similar to or

from the theoretical point of view the problem of non-stationary accretion has
been addressed by many authors, observational study of this phenomenon is often
problematic as it requires very high statistics of X-ray data and a specific
analysis technique. In our research we used high-resolution data taken with
RXTE and INTEGRAL on a sample of bright transient and persistent pulsars, to
perform an in-depth study of their variability on time scales comparable to the

us to collect individual pulses of different amplitude and reveal differences
in their spectra (such an analysis we refer to as ""pulse-to-pulse

luminosity-dependence of pulsars' X-ray spectra in observations where the
averaged (over many pulse cycles) luminosity of the source remained constant

named the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope -- LAMOST)
during the 2009 commissioning phase. Due to the absence of standard stars for
flux calibration, we use the photometric data of 15 intermediate bands in the
Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut (BATC) survey to calibrate the spectra.
Total 59 spectra located in the bulge and disk of the galaxy are obtained.
Kinematic and stellar population properties of the stellar content are derived
with these spectra. We obtain the global velocity field and calculate
corresponding rotation velocities outer to about 7 kpc along the major axis.
These rotation velocity measurements complement those of the gas content, such
as the H {\sc i} and CO. The radial velocity dispersion presents that the stars
in the bulge are more dynamically thermal and the disk is more
rotation-supported. The age distribution shows that the bulge was formed about
12 Gyr ago, the disk is relatively younger, and the ages of some regions along
the spiral arms can reach as young as about 1 Gyr. These young stellar
populations have relatively richer abundance and larger reddening. The overall
average metallicity of the galaxy approximates the solar metallicity and a very
weak abundance gradient is gained. The reddening map gives a picture of a
dust-free bulge and a distinct dusty ring in the disk.

observed in spectroscopy with the Narval spectrograph at the same epoch. We
characterise HD 52265 using both spectroscopic and seismic data. The

We performed a global fit of the oscillation spectrum, over about ten radial

granulation, and analysed a signature of the rotation induced by the
photospheric magnetic activity. Precise determinations of fundamental

  The unitary quantum dynamics","38 pages, no figure",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown in the paper that the unitary quantum dynamics in quantum
mechanics is the universal quantum driving force to speed up a quantum
computation. This assertion supports strongly in theory that the unitary
quantum dynamics is the fundamental and universal principle in nature. On the
other hand, the symmetric structure of Hilbert space of a composite quantum
system is the quantum-computing resource that is not owned by classical
computation. A new quantum-computing speedup theory is set up on the basis of
the unitary quantum dynamics. Both the unitary quantum dynamics and the
symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space of the quantum system are
mainly responsible for an exponential quantum-computing speedup for a general
efficient quantum algorithm. The inherent importance for the unitary quantum
dynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the
unitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the
symmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the
mathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum
system. This unique ability could result in an essential difference of
computational power between quantum and classical computations by combining the
symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space. The new
quantum-computing speedup theory also provides reasonable mechanisms for
exponential quantum-computing speedup for the existing efficient quantum
algorithms based on the quantum parallel principle. These existing quantum
algorithms including the hidden-subgroup-problem quantum algorithms and
conventional quantum search algorithms have the common character that the
symmetric structure of the Hilbert space does not have any effective effect on
these quantum algorithms. This could be the main reason why these quantum
algorithms are quite special and considered to be semiclassical.

black hole binary GX 339--4 in the low/hard state were performed with Suzaku

thermal Comptonization of multicolor disk photons, with a small contribution
from a direct disk component, indicating that the inner disk is almost fully
covered by hot corona with an electron temperature of $\approx$175 keV. The
Comptonizing corona has at least two optical depths, $\tau \approx 1,0.4$.
Analysis of the iron-K line profile yields an inner disk radius of
$(13.3^{+6.4}_{-6.0}) R_{\rm g}$ ($R_{\rm g} $ represents the gravitational
radius $GM/c^2$), with the best-fit inclination angle of $\approx50^\circ$.
This radius is consistent with that estimated from the continuum fit by
assuming the conservation of photon numbers in Comptonization. Our results
suggest that the standard disk of GX 339--4 is likely truncated before reaching
the innermost stable circular orbit (for a non rotating black hole) in the
low/hard state at $\sim$1% of the Eddington luminosity. The one-day averaged
near-infrared light curves are found to be correlated with hard X-ray flux with
$F_{\rm Ks} \propto F_{\rm X}^{0.45}$. The flatter near infrared $\nu F_{\nu}$
spectrum than the radio one suggests that the optically thin synchrotron
radiation from the compact jets dominates the near-infrared flux. Based on a
simple analysis, we estimate the magnetic field and size of the jet base to be
$5\times10^4$ G and $6\times 10^8$ cm, respectively. The synchrotron self
Compton component is estimated to be approximately 0.4% of the total X-ray

study the case of two different radiations polarized in the same direction with
different or equal frequencies. For both cases we find a regime of
superposition or interference of harmonic motions. When the frequencies are

an outcome similar to darkness. Finally, we consider a multiple photoexcitation

system with almost homogeneously distributed As-vacancies (AV), as suggested by
the (75)As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements,we observe a strong
enhancement of the spin-susceptibility by a factor of 3-7. This observation is
attributed to the presence of an electronically localized state around each AV,
carrying a magnetic moment of about 3.2 mu_Bohr per AV or 0.8 mu_Bohr/Fe atom.
From theoretical considerations we find that the formation of a local moment on
neighboring iron sites of an AV sets in when the local Coulomb interaction
exceeds a critical value of about 1.0 eV in the dilute limit. Its estimated
value amounts to ~ 2.5 eV and implies an upper bound of ~ 2 eV for the Coulomb
repulsion at Fe sites beyond the first neighbor-shell of an AV. Electronic
correlations are thus moderate/weak in doped La-1111. The strongly enhanced
spin susceptibility is responsible for the Pauli limiting behavior of the
superconductivity that we observe in As-deficient LaO_0.9F_0.1FeAs_1-delta. In
contrast, no Pauli limiting behavior is found for the optimally doped,
As-stoichiometric LaO_0.9F_0.1FeAs superconductor in accord with its low spin
susceptibility.

tensor products. The multiplication of such fields is decomposed into three
operations, describing the multiplication in the algebra M of functions on
noncommutative space-time, the product in the algebra H of deformed field
oscillators, and the braiding by factor Psi_{M,H} between algebras M and H. For
noncommutativity generated by the twist factor we shall employ the star-product
realizations of the algebra M in terms of functions on standard Minkowski
space. The covariance of single noncommutative quantum fields under deformed
Poincare symmetries is described by the algebraic covariance conditions which
are equivalent to the deformation of generalized Heisenberg equations on
Poincare group manifold. We shall calculate the covariant braided field
commutator, which for free quantum noncommutative fields provides the field
quantization condition and is given by standard Pauli-Jordan function. For
ilustration of our new scheme we present explicit calculations for the
well-known case in the literature of canonically deformed free quantum fields.

is killed at the boundary and which, while alive, jumps instantaneously
according to a spatially dependent exponential clock with intensity $\gamma V$
to a new point, according to a distribution $\mu\in\mathcal P(D)$. From its new
position after the jump, the process repeats the above behavior independently
of what has transpired previously. The generator of this process is an
extension of the operator $-L_{\gamma,\mu}$, defined by L_{\gamma,\mu}u\equiv
-\frac12\Delta u+\gamma V C_\mu(u), with the Dirichlet boundary condition,
where $C_\mu$ is the ""$\mu$-centering"" operator defined by C_\mu(u)=u-\int_Du

  The principal eigenvalue, $\lambda_0(\gamma,\mu)$, of $L_{\gamma,\mu}$
governs the exponential rate of decay of the probability of not exiting $D$ for
large time. We study the asymptotic behavior of $\lambda_0(\gamma,\mu)$ as
$\gamma\to\infty$. In particular, if $\mu$ possesses a density in a
neighborhood of the boundary, which we call $\mu$, then
\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\gamma^{-\frac12}\lambda_0(\gamma,\mu)=\frac{\int_{\partial
D}\frac\mu{\sqrt {V}}d\sigma}{\sqrt2\int_D\frac1{V}d\mu}. If $\mu$ and all its
derivatives up to order $k-1$ vanish on the boundary, but the $k$-th derivative
does not vanish identically on the boundary, then $\lambda_0(\gamma,\mu)$
behaves asymptotically like $c_k\gamma^{\frac{1-k}2}$, for an explicit constant
$c_k$.

the white dwarf. The spin period inferred from the infrared data closely
matches that determined from X-ray and optical observations. WX Pyx is a system
whose orbital period has not been measured directly and which is not too well
constrained. From the IR observations, a likely peak at 5.30 $\pm$ 0.02 hour is
seen in the power spectrum of the object. It is suggested that this corresponds
to the orbital period of the system. In case this is indeed the true orbital
period, some of the system physical parameters may be estimated. Our analysis
indicates that the secondary star is of M2 spectral type and the distance to
the object is 1.53 kpc. An upper limit of 30$^\circ$ for the angle of
inclination of the system is suggested. The mass transfer rate and the magnetic
moment of the white dwarf are estimated to be (0.95 - 1.6)$\times 10^{-9}

shown to achieve a near-minimax rate of convergence. This rate depends both on
the smoothness of the intensity function and the density of the random shifts,
which makes a connection between the classical deconvolution problem in

models are not able to correctly predict the amplitude of the scale-dependent

examine three theoretical approaches based on (1) the statistics of thresholded

(3) a peak-background split method using the conditional mass function. We
first demonstrate that the statistics of thresholded regions, which is shown to
be equivalent at leading order to a local bias expansion, cannot explain the
mass-dependent deviation between theory and N-body simulations. In the two
formulations of the peak-background split on the other hand, we identify an
important, but previously overlooked, correction to the non-Gaussian bias that
strongly depends on halo mass. This new term is in general significant for any
primordial non-Gaussianity going beyond the simplest local fNL model. In a
separate paper, we compare these new theoretical predictions with N-body
simulations, showing good agreement for all simulated types of non-Gaussianity.

quadrant where a number of young/embedded star clusters are projected close to
more evolved, intermediate age clusters. It is also rich in interstellar
matter, and contains evidence of the interplay between massive stars and their
surrounding medium, such as the rim HII region NGC 6188. Aims: We provide
robust estimates of the fundamental parameters (age and distance) of the two
most prominent stellar clusters, NGC 6167 and NGC 6193, that may be used as a
basis for studing the star formation history of the region. Methods: The study
is based on a photometric optical survey (UBVIHa) of NGC 6167 and NGC 6193 and
their nearby field, complemented with public data from 2MASS-VVV, UCAC3, and
IRAC-Spitzer in this region. Results: We produce a uniform photometric
catalogue and estimate more robustly the fundamental parameters of NGC 6167 and
NGC 6193, in addition to the IRAS 16375-4854 source. As a consequence, all of
them are located at approximately the same distance from the Sun in the
Sagittarius-Carina Galactic arm. However, the ages we estimate differ widely:
NGC 6167 is found to be an intermediate-age cluster (20-30 Myr), NGC 6193 a
very young one (1-5 Myr) with PMS, H? emitters and class II objects, and the
IRAS 16375-4854 source is the youngest of the three containing several YSOs.
Conclusions: These results support a picture in which Ara OB1a is a region
where star formation has proceeded for several tens of Myr until the present.
The difference in the ages of the different stellar groups can be interpreted
as a consequence of a triggered star formation process. In the specific case of
NGC 6193, we find evidence of possible non-coeval star formation.

demonstrate the existence of the bias using sample cluster populations,

more suitable and unbiased measures of the rareness of individual clusters.
Each different measure will be most sensitive to different possible types of
new physics. I show how to generalise these measures to quantify the total
`rareness' of a set of clusters. It is seen that, when mass uncertainties are
marginalised over, there is no tension between the standard LambdaCDM
cosmological model and the existence of any observed set of clusters. As a case

to obtain a closed set of kinetic equations for the singlet phase space
distribution functions of each species. The interactions among particles are
considered within a self-consistent approximation and the resulting effective
molecular fields are analyzed. We focus on multispecies diffusion in systems
with short-range hard-core repulsion between particles of unequal sizes and
weak attractive long-range interactions. As a result, the attractive part of
the potential does not contribute explicitly to viscosity but to diffusivity
and the thermodynamic properties. Finally, we obtain a practical scheme to
solve the kinetic equations by employing a discretization procedure derived
from the Lattice Boltzmann approach. Within this framework, we present
numerical data concerning the mutual diffusion properties both in the case of a
quiescent bulk fluid and shear flow inducing Taylor dispersion.

inference and learning from arbitrary uncertain information. It exploits the
calculation properties of finite mixture models, conjugate families and
factorization. Both the joint probability density of the variables and the
likelihood function of the (objective or subjective) observation are
approximated by a special mixture model, in such a way that any desired
conditional distribution can be directly obtained without numerical
integration. We have developed an extended version of the expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of mixture models from
uncertain training examples (indirect observations). As a consequence, any
piece of exact or uncertain information about both input and output values is
consistently handled in the inference and learning stages. This ability,
extremely useful in certain situations, is not found in most alternative
methods. The proposed framework is formally justified from standard
probabilistic principles and illustrative examples are provided in the fields
of nonparametric pattern classification, nonlinear regression and pattern
completion. Finally, experiments on a real application and comparative results
over standard databases provide empirical evidence of the utility of the method
in a wide range of applications.

unconditionally heteroscedastic errors is studied. The volatility structure is
deterministic but time-varying and allows for changes that are commonly
observed in economic or financial multivariate series. Our analysis is based on
the residual autocovariances and autocorrelations obtained from Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS), Generalized Least Squares (GLS)and Adaptive Least Squares (ALS)
estimation of the autoregressive parameters. The ALS approach is the GLS
approach adapted to the unknown time-varying volatility that is then estimated
by kernel smoothing. The properties of the three types of residual
autocovariances and autocorrelations are derived. In particular it is shown
that the ALS and GLS residual autocorrelations are asymptotically equivalent.
It is also found that the asymptotic distribution of the OLS residual
autocorrelations can be quite different from the standard chi-square asymptotic
distribution obtained in a correctly specified VAR model with iid innovations.
As a consequence the standard portmanteau tests are unreliable in our
framework. The correct critical values of the standard portmanteau tests based
on the OLS residuals are derived. Moreover, modified portmanteau statistics
based on ALS residual autocorrelations are introduced. Portmanteau tests with
modified statistics based on OLS and ALS residuals and standard chi-square
asymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis are also proposed. An
extension of our portmanteau approaches to testing the lag length in a vector
error correction type model for co-integrating relations is briefly
investigated. The finite sample properties of the goodness-of-fit tests we
consider are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments. The theoretical results
are also illustrated using two U.S. economic data sets.

cosmic time. During each merger, supermassive black hole binaries are
surrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk that imposes a significant (~1e4 G
for a binary of 1e8 Msun) magnetic field. The motion of the binary through that
field will convert the field energy to Poynting flux, with a luminosity ~1e43
erg/s (B/1e4 G)^2 (M/1e8 Msun)^2, some of which may emerge as synchrotron
emission at frequencies near 1 GHz where current and planned wide-field radio
surveys will operate. We find that the short timescales of many mergers will
limit their detectability with most planned blind surveys to <1 per year over
the whole sky, independent of the details of the emission process and flux
distribution. Including an optimistic estimate for the radio flux makes
detection even less likely, with <1 mergers per year over the whole sky.
However, wide-field radio instruments may be able to localize systems
identified in advance of merger by gravitational waves. Further, radio surveys
may be able to detect the weaker emission produced by the binary's motion as it
is modulated by spin-orbit precession and inspiral well in advance of merger.

describing the diffusive transport in a nanowire. From a physical point of
view, it describes the electron transport in an ultra-scaled confined
structure, taking in account the interactions of charged particles with
phonons. The transport direction is assumed to be large compared to the wire
section and is described by a drift-diffusion equation including effective
quantities computed from a Bloch problem in the crystal lattice. The
electrostatic potential solves a Poisson equation where the particle density
couples on each energy band a two dimensional confinement density with the
monodimensional transport density given by the Boltzmann statistics. On the one
hand, we study the derivation of this Nanowire Drift-Diffusion Poisson model
from a kinetic level description. On the other hand, we present an existence

different contexts, particularly in ecology and systems biology. It can be used
to analyze the stability and bifurcations of steady-state solutions. Although
many dynamical systems in mathematical biology exhibit steady-state behaviour
one also wants to understand nonlocal dynamics beyond equilibrium points. In
this paper we analyze predator-prey dynamical systems and extend the method of
generalized models to periodic solutions. First, we adapt the equilibrium
generalized modeling approach and compute the unique Floquet multiplier of the
periodic solution which depends upon so-called generalized elasticity and scale
functions. We prove that these functions also have to satisfy a flow on
parameter (or moduli) space. Then we use Fourier analysis to provide computable
conditions for stability and the moduli space flow. The final stability
analysis reduces to two discrete convolutions which can be interpreted to
understand when the predator-prey system is stable and what factors enhance or
prohibit stable oscillatory behaviour. Finally, we provide a sampling algorithm
for parameter space based on nonlinear optimization and the Fast Fourier
Transform which enables us to gain a statistical understanding of the stability
properties of periodic predator-prey dynamics.
