138 weeks of observations by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). We
probe the behaviour of the source as a function of time at different brightness
levels. The Fermi spectra in the GeV range can be well described by a wide
underlying lognormal distribution with the photon-photon absorption breaks
produced by the He II and H I Lyman recombination continua (LyC). We find a
power-law dependence of the peak energy on flux and discover anti-correlation
between the column density of the He II LyC and flux. This implies that the
gamma-ray emission zone lies close to the boundary of the high-ionization part
of the broad-line region and moves away from the black hole when the flux
increases. Identification of the gamma-ray production with the relativistic
jet, implies that the jet is already accelerated at sub-parsec distances from
the central black hole, which favours the Blandford-Znajek process as the jet
launching mechanism.

the well known standard gauge transformations (SGT) dictated by the $SU_4(N)$
group under which the zero Fourier modes transform as gauge fields, and a set
of nonstandard gauge transformations (NSGT) determining the gauge nature of the

for removing the degeneration associated with the NSGT, we integrate out the KK

all of the independent canonical-dimension-six operators that are invariant

  should have been 'days'. This has been corrected",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  At present, the best hope for eliminating HIV transmission and bringing the
epidemic of HIV to an end lies in the use of anti-retroviral therapy for
prevention, a strategy referred to variously as Test and Treat (T&T), Treatment
as Prevention (TasP) or Treatment centred Prevention (TcP). One of the key
objections to the use of T&T to stop transmission concerns the role of the
acute phase in HIV transmission. The acute phase of infection lasts for one to
three months after HIV-seroconversion during which time the risk of
transmission may be ten to twenty times higher, per sexual encounter, than it
is during the chronic phase which lasts for the next ten years. Regular testing
for HIV is more likely to miss people who are in the acute phase than in the
chronic phase and it is essential to determine the extent to which this might
compromise the impact of T&T on HIV-transmission.
  Here we show that 1) provided the initial epidemic doubling time is about 1.0
to 1.5 years, as observed in South Africa, random testing with an average test
interval of one year will still bring the epidemic close to elimination even if
the acute phase lasts for 3 months during which time transmission is 26 times
higher than in the chronic phase; 2) testing people regularly at yearly
intervals is significantly more effective then testing them randomly; 3)
testing people regularly at six monthly intervals and starting them on ART
immediately, will almost certainly guarantee elimination.
  In general it seems unlikely that elevated transmission during the acute
phase is likely to change predictions of the impact of treatment on
transmission significantly. Other factors, in particular age structure, the
structure of sexual networks and variation in set-point viral load are likely
to be more important and should be given priority in further analyses.

to its $O(N^n)$ scaling cost. In this paper we describe a fast tree-code for
efficiently approximating multibody potentials that can be factorized as

derive a Barnes-Hut type algorithm for handling interactions among more than

the central limit theorem. Our approach guarantees a user-specified bound on

escape. There is an overall consensus that black holes exist and many
astronomical objects are identified with black holes. White holes were
understood as the exact time reversal of black holes, therefore they should
continuously throw away material. It is accepted, however, that a persistent
ejection of mass leads to gravitational pressure, the formation of a black hole
and thus to the ""death of while holes"". So far, no astronomical source has been
successfully tagged a white hole. The only known white hole is the Big Bang
which was instantaneous rather than continuous or long-lasting. We thus suggest
that the emergence of a white hole, which we name a 'Small Bang', is
spontaneous - all the matter is ejected at a single pulse. Unlike black holes,
white holes cannot be continuously observed rather their effect can only be
detected around the event itself. Gamma ray bursts are the most energetic
explosions in the universe. Long gamma-ray bursts were connected with supernova
eruptions. There is a new group of gamma-ray bursts, which are relatively close
to Earth, but surprisingly lack any supernova emission. We propose identifying
these bursts with white holes. White holes seem like the best explanation of
gamma-ray bursts that appear in voids. We also predict the detection of rare
gigantic gamma-ray bursts with energies much higher than typically observed.

that the 3 dimension kinematics of lobes can be obtained. Thus, for the first

naturally explains the asymmetry displayed in the morphology of these sources,

demonstrated. The precession period may originate from long-term effects of a

transition between nodeless and nodal superconductivity in iron-based
compounds. We find that the low-temperature behavior of the penetration depth,
the specific heat, and the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate are determined by
the scaling properties of a quantum critical point associated with the nascent
nodes. Although the power-law exponents are insensitive to weak short-range
electronic interactions, they can be significantly altered by the curvature of
the Fermi surface or by the three-dimensional character of the gap.
Consequently, the behavior of macroscopic quantities near the onset of nodes
can be used as a criterion to determine the nodal structure of the gap
function.

imply that simulating the dynamics of a Hopfield network, requiring the update

hybrid Boltzmann Machine, requiring the update of N+P neurons but the storage
of only NP synapses. In addition, the well known glass transition of the
Hopfield network has a counterpart in the Boltzmann Machine: It corresponds to
an optimum criterion for selecting the relative sizes of the hidden and visible
layers, resolving the trade-off between flexibility and generality of the

the main regimes in the network dynamics in terms of the key control
parameters: excitability, coupling strength, and network topology. The analysis
reveals the geometry of spontaneous dynamics in electrically coupled network.
Specifically, we show that the location of the minima of a certain continuous
function on the surface of the unit n-cube encodes the most likely activity
patterns generated by the network. By studying how the minima of this function
evolve under the variation of the coupling strength, we describe the principal
transformations in the network dynamics. The minimization problem is also used

between them. In particular, for the weak and strong coupling regimes, we
present asymptotic formulas for the network activity rate as a function of the
coupling strength and the degree of the network. The variational analysis is
complemented by the stability analysis of the synchronous state in the strong
coupling regime. The stability estimates reveal the contribution of the network
connectivity and the properties of the cycle subspace associated with the graph
of the network to its synchronization properties. This work is motivated by the

parameters with non-empty interior.
  There is an interior fixed point of the Poincare' map defined by the system.
This fixed point corresponds to a periodic solution with period $T$ in which
the three cluster exchange positions after time $T/3$. We call this solution
3=cyclic. In all the parameters studied, the fixed point is either:
  * isolated and locally unstable, or,
  * contained in a neutrally stable set of period 3 points.
  In the later case the edges of the neutrally stable set are unstable. This
case exists if either the three clusters are isolated from each other, or, if
they interact in a non-essential way. In both cases the orbits of all other
interior points are asymptotic to the boundary. Thus 3-cyclic solutions are
practically unstable in the sense the arbitrarily small perturbations may lead
to loss of stability and eventual merger of clusters. Since the single cluster
solution (synchronization) is the only solution that is asymptotically stable,
it would seem to be the most likely to be observed in application if the
feedback is similar to the form we propose and is positive.

50 mK, a mobility of 2.6 x 10^6 cm^2/Vs at a density p=6.2 x 10^10 cm^- was
measured. This is the highest mobility reported for a 2DHS to date. Using a
back-gated sample geometry, the density dependence of mobility was studied from
2.8 x 10^10 cm^-2 to 1 x 10^11 cm^-2. The mobility vs. density cannot be fit to
a power law dependence of the form mu ~ p^alpha using a single exponent alpha.
Our data indicate a continuous evolution of the power law with alpha ranging
from ~ 0.7 at high density and increasing to ~ 1.7 at the lowest densities
measured. Calculations specific to our structure indicate a crossover of the
dominant scattering mechanism from uniform background impurity scattering at
high density to remote ionized impurity scattering at low densities. This is
the first observation of a carrier density-induced transition from background
impurity dominated to remote dopant dominated transport in a single sample.

which the periastron distance is close to the tidal disruption radius - three
independent lines of argument indicate the orbit must be deeply plunging or
else the powerful jet we are observing could not be produced. These arguments
stem from (i) comparing the early X-ray light curve to the expected theoretical
fallback rate, (ii) looking at the time of transition to disk-dominated decay,
and (iii) considering the TDE rate. Due to the extreme excess in the tidal
force above that which would be required minimally to disrupt the star in a
deeply plunging orbit at periastron, we suggest this scenario might be referred
to more descriptively as a TOE (tidal obliteration event) rather than a TDE.

the small off-diagonal elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix
and the small quark masses of the first two generations are generated from the
trilinear supersymmetry-breaking terms. The impact of RFV on flavor-physics
observables is studied in detail. We focus on the limiting cases in which the
CKM matrix is either generated in the down-sector, i.e. by the soft
SUSY-breaking mass insertions delta^dLR_i3 (i=1,2), or in the up-quark sector,
i.e. by the mass insertions delta^uLR_i3. In the first case we find an
enhancement of b->s gamma, which constrains the allowed range of sparticle
masses (Fig. 3). In addition, neutral Higgs penguins significantly contribute
to B_s,d->mu^+mu^- and, if also delta^dLR_32 is different from zero, these
Higgs effects are capable of explaining the observed CP phase in the B_s
system. If, on the other hand, the CKM generation takes place in the up-sector,
|epsilon_K| receives additional positive contributions enforcing large squark
and gluino masses (see Fig. 8). In this case also the rare decay K->pi nu nu
receives sizable contributions. In conclusion we find that for SUSY masses
around 1 TeV RFV is an interesting alternative to Minimal Flavor Violation
(MFV).

We find that the global radio continuum spectrum shows signs that free-free
absorption and/or synchrotron losses may be important. The 3cm radio continuum
morphology is similar to that of the Halpha, while the 20cm emission is more
diffuse. We estimate that 50% of the radio continuum emission in the center of
the galaxy is thermal. Our estimate of the magnetic field strength is $30\pm
9.5$ \uG\ in the center and $10\pm3$ \uG\ at the edges. We find that the hot
gas, magnetic, and the gravitational pressures are all the same order of
magnitude. Inside the central star forming regions, we find that the thermal
and turbulent pressures of the HII regions dominate the pressure balance. We do
not detect any significant polarization on size scales greater than 200 pc. We
place an upper limit of 8 \uG\ on the uniform field strength in this galaxy. We
suggest that the diffuse synchrotron region, seen to the north of the main body
of emission at 20cm, is elongated due to a uniform magnetic field with a
maximum field strength of 7.6 \uG. We find that, while the shear in NGC 4214 is
comparable to that of the Milky Way, the supernova rate is half that of the
Milky Way and suggest that the star formation episode in NGC 4214 needs
additional time to build up enough turbulence to drive an $\alpha-\omega$
dynamo.

hydrodynamics via a high-resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) scheme. We track the
inspiral starting from a binary separation of 10M, where M is the total binary
mass. We take the disks to have an inner radius at R_in~15M to account for the
hollow created by the binary torques. Our disks extend to R=65M and have an
initial scale height of H/R=0.03-0.11. The gas is governed by a Gamma-law EOS,
with Gamma equal to 5/3, 4/3, and 1.1. Disks are allowed to relax in the ""early

evolve the metric and matter during the ""late inspiral and merger"" epoch. The
later simulations are designed to track BHBH inspiral following disk-binary
decoupling, through merger and ringdown, terminating before viscosity has time
to fill the hollow about the remnant. We compute the gas flow and accretion
rate and estimate the electromagnetic luminosity due to bremsstrahlung and
synchrotron emission as a perturbation for optically thin disks. The
synchrotron component of the luminosity peaks in the infrared band and should
be detectable by WFIRST and possibly the LSST for a 10^8 M_sun binary embedded

1.7x10^{42} erg s^{-1} corresponding to a star formation rate (SFR) of 14
M_{sun} yr^{-1}. We place, for the first time, a firm lower limit to the
average metallicity of LAEs of Z>~0.09 Z_{sun} (2sigma) based on the
[OII]/(Ha+[NII]) index together with photo-ionization models and empirical
relations. This lower limit of metallicity rules out the hypothesis that LAEs,
so far observed at z~2, are extremely metal poor (Z<2x10^{-2} Z_{sun}) young
galaxies at the 4sigma level. This limit is higher than a simple extrapolation
of the observed mass-metallicity relation of z~2 UV-selected galaxies toward
lower masses (5x10^{8} M_{sun}), but roughly consistent with a recently
proposed fundamental mass-metallicity relation when the LAEs' relatively low
SFR is taken into account. The Ha and Lya luminosities of our NB-selected LAEs
indicate that the escape fraction of Lya photons is ~12-30 %, much higher than
the values derived for other galaxy populations at z~2.

of the Novikov-Thorne model, there can be substantial magnetic stress
throughout the plunging region. Additional dissipation and radiation can
therefore be expected. We use data from a particularly well-resolved simulation
of accretion onto a non-spinning black hole to compute both the radiative
efficiency of such a flow and its spectrum if all emitted light is radiated
with a thermal spectrum whose temperature matches the local effective
temperature. This disk is geometrically thin enough (H/r ~= 0.06) that little
heat is retained in the flow. In terms of light reaching infinity (i.e., after
allowance for all relativistic effects and for photon capture by the black
hole), we find that the radiative efficiency is at least ~=6-10% greater than
predicted by the Novikov-Thorne model (complete radiation of all heat might
yield another ~6%). We also find that the spectrum more closely resembles the
Novikov-Thorne prediction for a/M ~= 0.2--0.3 than for the correct value,
a/M=0. As a result, if the spin of a non-spinning black hole is inferred by
model-fitting to a Novikov-Thorne model with known black hole mass, distance,
and inclination, the inferred a/M is too large by ~= 0.2--0.3.

  welcome",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19033.x",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the effect of entropy injection in the intracluster medium (ICM) in
light of the recent observationally determined universal pressure profile of
the ICM. Beginning with a power-law entropy profile that is expected in the
absence of any feedback, we show that a simple universal prescription of
entropy injection results in the final, observed universal pressure profile.
This simple prescription has two components, one associated with an overall
increase in entropy and another associated with injection in the central parts
of the cluster. Importantly, both the components of entropy injection are
needed to produce the final universal pressure profile. This is indicative of a
need of both preheating the ICM as well {\it in situ} AGN/SNe heating. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the method by extending the calculations to
clusters at high redshift, and predict redshift evolution of cluster scaling
relations that can be tested against data. We show that the self-similar
evolution of the universal pressure profile is equivalent to a negative
evolution of entropy injection with redshift, with a scaling $S_{inj} \propto
(1+z)^{-0.8} S_{inj}(z=0)$. We also show the current observational data are
indicative of the entropy injection decreasing with redshift.

tiny and blue-shifted frequency drift that changes smoothly at a rate of $ \sim

Arp 299. One of these is unclassified, leaving 6 core-collapse events; 2 type
II, 2 type Ib, a type IIb and one object of indistinct type; Ib/IIb. We analyse
the relative numbers of these types, together with their positions with respect
to host galaxy properties, to investigate implications for both progenitor
characteristics and star formation (SF) properties. Our findings are: 1) the
ratio of 'stripped envelope' (SE) events to other type II is higher than that
found in the local Universe. 2) All SE SNe are more centrally concentrated
within the system than the other type II. 3) All SN environments have similar
metallicities and there are no significant metallicity gradients across the
system. 4) The SE SNe all fall on bright SF regions while the other type II are
found to occur away from bright HII regions. We draw two different -but
non-mutually exclusive- interpretations on the system and its supernovae: 1)
The distribution of SNe, and the relatively high fraction of types Ib and IIb
events over other type II can be explained by the young age of the most recent
SF in the system, where insufficient time has expired for the observed to match
the 'true' relative SN rates. This explanation provides additional independent
evidence that both types Ib and IIb SNe arise from progenitors of shorter
stellar lifetime and hence higher mass than other type II. 2) Given the
assumption that types Ib and IIb trace higher mass progenitor stars, the
relatively high frequency of types Ib and IIb to other type II, and also the
centralisation of the former over the latter with respect to host galaxy light
implies that in the centrally peaked and enhanced SF within this system, the
initial mass function is biased towards the production of high mass stars.

no overall effect on the background noise levels, which are dominated by the
thermal noise floor of the cold polar ice, and galactic noise at lower

cold polar ice. These are also the first such measurements for propagation over
such large slant distances in ice. Based on these data, ARA-37, the 200 km^2

We found that when $Z\leq0.02$, the carbon abundance is almost independent of
metallicity if it is plotted against the initial WD mass. However, when
$Z>0.02$, the carbon abundance is not only a function of the initial WD mass,
but also metallicity, i.e. for a given initial WD mass, the higher the
metallicity, the lower the carbon abundance. Based on some previous studies,
i.e. both a high metallicity and a low carbon abundance lead to a lower
production of $^{\rm 56}$Ni formed during SN Ia explosion, the effects of the
carbon abundance and the metallicity on the amount of $^{\rm 56}$Ni are
enhanced by each other, which may account for the variation of maximum
luminosity of SNe Ia, at least qualitatively. Considering that the central
density of WD before supernova explosion may also play a role on the production
of $^{\rm 56}$Ni and the carbon abundance, the metallicity and the central
density are all determined by the initial parameters of progenitor system, i.e.
the initial WD mass, metallicity, orbital period and secondary mass, the amount

case such that each component is degraded. We show the rate-distortion function
for that case, and give the following observations. When the components are
degraded in matched order, the rate distortion function of the product sources
is equal to the sum of the component-wise rate distortion functions. On the
otherhand, the former is strictly smaller than the latter when the component
sources are degraded in mismatched order. The converse proof for the mismatched

Birk and T. Kol (IEEE INFOCOM, 1998). In the present work, a generalization of
index coding scheme, where transmitted symbols are subject to errors, is
studied. Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are
investigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the
side information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of
erroneous symbols $\delta$, what is the shortest length of a linear index code,
such that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This
question turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a
shortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting
capability in the classical coding theory.
  The Singleton bound and two other bounds, referred to as the $\alpha$-bound
and the $\kappa$-bound, for the optimal length of a linear error-correcting
index code (ECIC) are established. For large alphabets, a construction based on
concatenation of an optimal index code with an MDS classical code, is shown to
attain the Singleton bound. For smaller alphabets, however, this construction
may not be optimal. A random construction is also analyzed. It yields another
implicit bound on the length of an optimal linear ECIC.
  Further, the problem of error-correcting decoding by a linear ECIC is
studied. It is shown that in order to decode correctly the desired symbol, the
decoder is required to find one of the vectors, belonging to an affine space
containing the actual error vector. The syndrome decoding is shown to produce
the correct output if the weight of the error pattern is less or equal to the
error-correcting capability of the corresponding ECIC.
  Finally, the notion of static ECIC, which is suitable for use with a family
of instances of an index coding problem, is introduced.

directed center-of-mass motion by a modulation of the Dirac-like equation, if

also an invariant length given by its constant curvature, $\Lambda$ and
spacetime is completely free of dynamics. Thus $c$ and $\Lambda$ are the only
two true constants of the spacetime structure and no other physical constant
could claim this degree of fundamentalness. When matter is introduced, the
spacetime becomes inhomogeneous and dynamic, and its curvature then determines
by the Bianchi differential identity the equation of motion for the Einstein
gravity. The homogeneity thus demands that the natural state of \textit{free
