correction due to the finite speed of light in absolute gravimeters is analyzed
from the viewpoint of special relativity. The relativistic concepts eventually
lead to the two classical approaches to the problem: analysis of the beat
frequency, and introduction of the retarded times. In the first approach, an
additional time delay has to be assumed, because the frequency of the beam
bounced from the accelerated reflector differs at the point of reflection from
that at the point of interference. The retarded times formalism is equivalent
to a single Doppler shift, but results in the same correction as the beat
frequency approach, even though the latter is explicitly combines two Doppler
shifts. In our comments we discuss these and other problems we found with the
suggested treatment of the correction.

transport of high energy particles in magnetic turbulence, either in the source
or en route to the observation sites. For strong turbulence and large rigidity,
the pitch-angle scattering rate is governed by a simple law involving a mean
free path that increases proportionally to the square of the particle energy.
In this paper, we show that perpendicular diffusion deviates from this behavior
in the presence of a mean field. We propose an exact theoretical derivation of
the diffusion coefficients and show that a mean field significantly changes the
transverse diffusion even in the presence of a stronger turbulent field. In
particular, the transverse diffusion coefficient is shown to reach a finite
value at large rigidity instead of increasing proportionally to the square of
the particle energy. Our theoretical derivation is corroborated by a dedicated
Monte Carlo simulation. We briefly discuss several possible applications in
astrophysics.

Systems Biology, although it is notoriously difficult to formally capture its
multifaceted nature. Maintenance of normal system function depends not only on
the stoichiometry of the underlying interrelated components, but also on a
multitude of kinetic parameters. For given parameter values, recent findings
have aimed at characterizing the property of the system components to exhibit
same concentrations in the resulting steady states, termed absolute
concentration robustness (ACR). However, the existing method for determining
system components exhibiting ACR is applicable only to one class of mass-action
networks for which this property can be confirmed, but not discarded. Here we
design a new method which relies on biochemical network decompositions into
subnetworks, called elementary flux modes, to identify ACR in a broader class
of mass-action networks by using only the given stoichiometry. This approach
reduces the problem of determining ACR to that of solving parameterized systems
of linear equations, rendering it amenable to networks of larger sizes. Our
unified framework will be helpful in analyzing this biologically important type
of robustness as well as detection of novel systemic properties independent of
the kinetic parameters for more complex biochemical networks.

in order to model deviations from neutrality, caused for example by different
forms of selection. Best understood is neutral genetic variation at a single
locus, but additional insights can be gained by investigating genetic variation
at multiple loci. The corresponding patterns of variation reflect linkage
disequilibrium and provide information about the underlying multi-locus gene
genealogies. The statistical properties of two-locus genealogies have been
intensively studied for populations of constant census size, as well as for
simple demographic histories such as exponential population growth, and single
bottlenecks. By contrast, the combined effect of recombination and sustained
demographic fluctuations is poorly understood. Addressing this issue, we study
a two-locus Wright-Fisher model of a population subject to recurrent
bottlenecks. We derive coalescent approximations for the covariance of the
times to the most recent common ancestor at two loci. We find, first, that an
effective population-size approximation describes the numerically observed
linkage disequilibrium provided that recombination occurs either much faster or
much more slowly than the population size changes. Second, when recombination
occurs frequently between bottlenecks but rarely within bottlenecks, we observe
long-range linkage disequilibrium. Third, we show that in the latter case, a
commonly used measure of linkage disequilibrium, sigma_d^2 (closely related to
r^2), fails to capture long-range linkage disequilibrium because constituent
terms, each reflecting long-range linkage disequilibrium, cancel. Fourth, we
analyse a limiting case in which long-range linkage disequilibrium can be
described in terms of a Xi-coalescent process allowing for simultaneous
multiple mergers of ancestral lines.

$O(r)$ identical servers, where $r\to\infty$ is the scaling parameter. The
arriving customers belong to one of several classes which determines the
service times in the distributional sense. The system is heavily loaded in the
Halfin-Whitt sense, namely the nominal utilization is $1-a/\sqrt{r}$ where
$a>0$ is the spare capacity parameter. Our goal is to obtain bounds on the
steady state performance metrics such as the number of customers waiting in the
queue $Q^r(\infty)$. While there is a rich literature on deriving process level
(transient) scaling limits for such systems, the results for steady state are
primarily limited to the single class case.
  This paper is the first one to address the case of heterogeneity in the
steady state regime. Moreover, our results hold for any service policy which
does not admit server idling when there are customers waiting in the queue. We
assume that the interarrival and service times have exponential distribution,
and that customers of each class may abandon while waiting in the queue at a
certain rate (which may be zero). We obtain upper bounds of the form
$O(\sqrt{r})$ on both $Q^r(\infty)$ and the number of idle servers. The bounds
are uniform w.r.t. parameter $r$ and the service policy. In particular, we show
that $\limsup_r E \exp(\theta r^{-1/2}Q^r(\infty))<\infty$. Therefore, the
sequence $r^{-1/2}Q^r(\infty)$ is tight and has a uniform exponential tail
bound. We further consider the system with strictly positive abandonment rates,
and show that in this case every weak limit $\hat{Q}(\infty)$ of
$r^{-1/2}Q^r(\infty)$ has a sub-Gaussian tail. Namely $E[\exp(\theta
(\hat{Q}(\infty))^2)]<\infty$, for some $\theta>0$.

in multiferroic compounds, using the Monte Carlo technique. Two simple models
were used to simulate the compounds. In the first one, the magnetic ions are
represented by a spin 1/2 2D Ising lattice of ions, and the electric lattice by
classical moments, coupled one to one with the magnetic moments. The coupling
between both lattices allows to the leading lattice, that is, the magnetic one,
to change the orientation of the electrical dipoles in one direction
perpendicular to the magnetic dipoles. This direction was chosen to accomplish
the symmetry requirements of the magnetoelectric effect. In the second case,
the magnetic lattice is also a 2D Ising lattice, but the electric momenta are
in a lattice that also behaves as an Ising lattice, perpendicular to the
magnetic moments. In this case, the one-to-one coupling of the electric and
magnetic momenta is represented by a two-valued energy parameter, allowing the
possibility of independent transition temperatures for both lattices. Both
models contain three independent parameters. We studied the physical properties
obtained with both models, as functions of the ratio of the three parameters.
The results in both cases allowed us to compare changes in the physics of the
models, and with the physics of compounds measured experimentally.

disciplines have been expressed in terms of high order and fractional PDEs.
Recently, Allouba introduced the Brownian-time Brownian sheet (BTBS) and
connected it to a new system of fourth order interacting PDEs. The interaction
in this multiparameter BTBS-PDEs connection is novel, leads to an
intimately-connected linear system variant of the celebrated
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, and is not shared with its one-time-parameter
counterpart. It also means that these PDEs systems are to be solved for a
family of functions, a feature exhibited in well known fluids dynamics models.
On the other hand, the memory-preserving interaction between the PDE solution
and the initial data is common to both the single and the multi parameter
Brownian-time PDEs. Here, we introduce a new---even in the one parameter
case---proof that judiciously combines stochastic analysis with analysis and
fractional calculus to simultaneously link BTBS to a new system of temporally
half-derivative interacting PDEs as well as to the fourth order system proved
earlier and differently by Allouba. We then introduce a general class of random
fields we call inverse-stable-L\'evy-time Brownian sheets (ISLTBSs), and we
link them to $\beta$-fractional-time-derivative systems of interacting PDEs for
$0<\beta<1$. When $\beta=1/\nu$, $\nu\in\lbr2,3,...\rbr$, our proof also
connects an ISLTBS to a system of memory-preserving $\nu$-Laplacian interacting
PDEs. Memory is expressed via a sum of temporally-scaled $k$-Laplacians of the
initial data, $k=1,..., \nu-1$. Using a
Fourier-Laplace-transform-fractional-calculus approach, we give a conditional
equivalence result that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the
equivalence between the fractional and the high order systems. In the one
parameter case this condition automatically holds.

flow of business processes have been designed since more than 15 years. Which
methods are best suited to verify the bulk of these models? The first step is
to select a formal language which fixes the semantics of the models. We adopt
the language of Boolean systems as reference language for Boolean process
models. Boolean systems form a simple subclass of coloured Petri nets. Their
characteristics are low tokens to model explicitly states with a subsequent
skipping of activations and arbitrary logical rules of type AND, XOR, OR etc.
to model the split and join of the control flow. We apply model checking as a
verification method for the safeness and liveness of Boolean systems. Model
checking of Boolean systems uses the elementary theory of propositional logic,
no modal operators are needed. Our verification builds on a finite complete
prefix of a certain T-system attached to the Boolean system. It splits the
processes of the Boolean system into a finite set of base processes of bounded
length. Their behaviour translates to formulas from propositional logic. Our
verification task consists in checking the satisfiability of these formulas. In
addition we have implemented our model checking algorithm as a java program.
The time needed to verify a given Boolean system depends critically on the
number of initial tokens. Because the algorithm has to solve certain
SAT-problems, polynomial complexity cannot be expected. The paper closes with
the model checking of some Boolean process models which have been designed as
Event-driven Process Chains.

compile a statistical sample of 50 tau_LLS > 2 LLSs drawn from 249 QSO sight
lines that avoid known targeting biases. The incidence of such LLSs per unit
redshift, l(z)=dn/dz, at these redshifts is well described by a single power
law, l(z) = C1 (1+z)^gamma, with gamma=1.33 +/- 0.61 at z<2.6, or with
gamma=1.83 +/- 0.21 over the redshift range 0.2 < z < 4.9. The incidence of
LLSs per absorption distance, l(X), decreases by a factor of ~1.5 over the ~0.6
Gyr from z=4.9 to 3.5; l(X) evolves much more slowly at low redshifts,
decreasing by a similar factor over the ~8 Gyr from z=2.6 to 0.25. We show that
the column density distribution function, f(N(HI)), at low redshift is not well
fitted by a single power law index (f(N(HI)) = C2 N(HI)^(-beta)) over the
column density range 13 < log N(HI) < 22 or log N(HI) >17.2. While low and high
redshift f(N(HI)) distributions are consistent for log N(HI)>19.0, there is
some evidence that f(N(HI)) evolves with z for log N(HI) < 17.7, possibly due
to the evolution of the UV background and galactic feedback. Assuming LLSs are
associated with individual galaxies, we show that the physical cross section of
the optically thick envelopes of galaxies decreased by a factor of ~9 from z~5

significant fraction of the observed population of LLSs arises in the

ground-breaking research in astronomy. The antennas observe omnidirectionally,
and sky sources are observed by signal-processing techniques that combine the
data from all antennas.
  Another new feature of LOFAR is the elaborate use of software to do signal
processing in real time, where traditional telescopes use custom-built

flexible. However, the enormous data rate (198 Gb/s of input data) and
processing requirements compel the use of a supercomputer: we use an IBM Blue
Gene/P.
  This paper presents a collection of new processing pipelines, collectively
called the beam-forming pipelines, that greatly enhance the functionality of
the telescope. Where our first pipeline could only correlate data to create sky
images, the new pipelines allow the discovery of unknown pulsars, observations
of known pulsars, and (in the future), to observe cosmic rays and study
transient events. Unlike traditional telescopes, we can observe in hundreds of
directions simultaneously. This is useful, for example, to search the sky for
new pulsars. The use of software allows us to quickly add new functionality and
to adapt to new insights that fully exploit the novel features and the power of
our unique instrument. We also describe our optimisations to use the Blue

International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2). Aims: To verify the influence
of the source's intrinsic structure on these differences. Methods: Instruments
with mosaics of CCDs were used to acquire the optical positions presented here,
leading us to opt for overlapping techniques to build a virtual, continuous CCD
over the whole angular size of the respective fields of view, whose translation
of the resulting intrumental positions into positions that are consistent with
those in the ICRF2 was made with the help of the UCAC2. Results: The
differences obtained between the optical and VLBI positions of the observed
sources may reach more than 80 milliarcseconds and, taking into consideration
that they are hardly explained only by statistical fluctuations or systematic
errors in the optical reference frame used here, we argue that these
differences can be related to the sources' X-band structure index (8.4 GHz).
Conclusions: In this context, the presence of the intrinsic structure should be
taken into consideration when comparing the optical and VLBI positions of ICRF2

(MBH) binary (MBHB) embedded in a rotating stellar cusp. Following the
observation that stars on counter-rotating (with respect to the MBHB) orbits
extract angular momentum from the binary more efficiently then their
co-rotating counterparts, the eccentricity evolution of the MBHB must depend on
the degree of co-rotation (counter-rotation) of the surrounding stellar
distribution. Using an hybrid scheme that couples numerical three-body
scatterings to an analytical formalism for the cusp-binary interaction, we
verify this hypothesis by evolving the MBHB in spherically symmetric cusps with
different fractions F of co-rotating stars. Consistently with previous works,
binaries in isotropic cusps (F=0.5) tend to increase their eccentricity, and
when F approaches zero (counter-rotating cusps) the eccentricity rapidly
increases to almost unity. Conversely, binaries in cusps with a significant
degree of co-rotation (F>0.7) tend to become less and less eccentric,
circularising quite quickly for F approaching unity. Direct N-body integrations
performed to test the theory, corroborate the results of the hybrid scheme, at
least at a qualitative level. We discuss quantitative differences, ascribing
their origin to the oversimplified nature of the hybrid approach.

function of the protostars in a region of star formation. It is determined
using the protostellar mass function (PMF) in combination with a stellar
evolutionary model that provides the luminosity as a function of instantaneous
and final stellar mass. As in McKee & Offner (2010), we consider three main
accretion models: the Isothermal Sphere model, the Turbulent Core model, and an
approximation of the Competitive Accretion model. We also consider the effect
of an accretion rate that tapers off linearly in time and an accelerating star
formation rate. For each model, we characterize the luminosity distribution
using the mean, median, maximum, ratio of the median to the mean, standard
deviation of the logarithm of the luminosity, and the fraction of very low
luminosity objects. We compare the models with bolometric luminosities observed
in local star forming regions and find that models with an approximately
constant accretion time, such as the Turbulent Core and Competitive Accretion
models, appear to agree better with observation than those with a constant
accretion rate, such as the Isothermal Sphere model. We show that observations
of the mean protostellar luminosity in these nearby regions of low-mass star
formation suggest a mean star formation time of 0.3$\pm$0.1 Myr. Such a
timescale, together with some accretion that occurs non-radiatively and some
that occurs in high-accretion, episodic bursts, resolves the classical
""luminosity problem"" in low-mass star formation, in which observed protostellar
luminosities are significantly less than predicted. An accelerating star
formation rate is one possible way of reconciling the observed star formation
time and mean luminosity.

almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported
exclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we
address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly,
this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus,
challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also
from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length
restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design
that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such
constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to
occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we
develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its
effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically
developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic
style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real

surprisingly successful, mostly due to the very small viscosity of the
Quark-Gluon plasma. In this paper we systematically study the propagation of
small perturbations, also treated hydrodynamically. We start with a number of
known techniques allowing for analytic calculation of the propagation of small
perturbations on top of the expanding fireball. The simplest approximation is
the ""geometric acoustics"", which substitutes the wave equation by mechanical
equations for the propagating ""phonons"". Next we turn to the case in which
variables can be separated, in which case one can obtain not only the eikonal
phases but also amplitudes of the perturbation. Finally, we focus on the so
called Gubser flow, a particular conformal analytic solution for the fireball
expansion, on top of which one can derive closed equations for small
perturbations. Perfect hydrodynamics allows all variables to be separated and
all equations to be solved in terms of known special functions. We can thus
collect the analytical expression for all the harmonics and reconstruct the
complete Green function of the problem. In the viscous case the equations still
allow for variable separation, but one of the equations has to be solved
numerically. We still can collect all the harmonics and show real-time
perturbation evolution, observing viscosity-induced changes in the spectra and
the correlation functions of secondaries. We end up by comparing the calculated
angular shape of the correlation function to the STAR experimental data, and
find, for sufficiently large viscosity, a surprisingly good agreement.

The transitions studied populate intermediate states of importance for the
(neutrinoless) $\beta\beta$ decay of $^{150}$Nd to $^{150}$Sm. Monopole and
dipole contributions to the measured excitation-energy spectra were extracted
by using multipole decomposition analyses. The experimental results were
compared with theoretical calculations obtained within the framework of
Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA), which is one of the main
methods employed for estimating the half-life of the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$
decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) of $^{150}$Nd. The present results thus provide useful
information on the neutrino responses for evaluating the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and
$2\nu\beta\beta$ matrix elements. The $2\nu\beta\beta$ matrix element
calculated from the Gamow-Teller transitions through the lowest $1^{+}$ state
in the intermediate nucleus is maximally about half of that deduced from the
half-life measured in $2\nu\beta\beta$ direct counting experiments and at least
several transitions through $1^{+}$ intermediate states in $^{150}$Pm are
required to explain the $2\nu\beta\beta$ half-life.
  Because Gamow-Teller transitions in the $^{150}$Sm($t$,$^3$He) experiment are
strongly Pauli-blocked, the extraction of Gamow-Teller strengths was
complicated by the excitation of the $2\hbar\omega$, $\Delta L=0$, $\Delta S=1$
isovector spin-flip giant monopole resonance (IVSGMR). However, the near
absence of Gamow-Teller transition strength made it possible to cleanly
identify this resonance, and the strength observed is consistent with the full
exhaustion of the non-energy-weighted sum rule for the IVSGMR.

A first paper in this series concentrated on disc properties. Here, we extend
this analysis to study how the formation history, structure and dynamics of
discs and spheroids relate to the assembly history and structure of their
haloes. We find that discs are generally young, with stars spanning a wide
range in stellar age: the youngest stars define thin discs and have
near-circular orbits, while the oldest stars form thicker discs which rotate ~2
times slower than the thin components, and have 2-3 times larger velocity
dispersions. Unlike the discs, spheroids form early and on short time-scales,
and are dominated by velocity dispersion. We find great variety in their
structure. The inner regions are bar- or bulge-like, while the extended outer
haloes are rich in complex non-equilibrium structures such as stellar streams,
shells and clumps. Our discs have very high in-situ fractions, i.e. most of
their stars formed in the disc itself. Nevertheless, there is a non-negligible
contribution (~15 percent) from satellites that are accreted on nearly coplanar
orbits. The inner regions of spheroids also have relatively high in-situ
fractions, but 65-85 percent of their outer stellar population is accreted. We
analyse the circular velocities, rotation velocities and velocity dispersions
of our discs and spheroids, both for gas and stars, showing that the dynamical
structure is complex as a result of the non-trivial interplay between cooling
and SN heating.

young star clusters hosting MSBHs in hard binaries with massive stars. We show
that a large fraction (~44 per cent) of MSBH binaries are ejected on a short

parent cluster is consistent with observations of X-ray binaries and
ultra-luminous X-ray sources. Furthermore, three-body encounters change the

the eccentricity of the system generally increases. We shortly discuss the

In each
model, the condensation mass increases linearly with radius on small scales,
and more rapidly on large scales, as in ""thermal-nonthermal"" models. Spherical
condensations with this structure form protostars which match the IMF if their
infall is subject to equally likely stopping. However such spherical models do
not match the filamentary nature of cluster gas, and they are too extended to
form protostars having high mass and short spacing. Two hybrid models are
presented, which are spherical on small scales and filamentary on large scales.
In and around clusters, cores embedded in linear filaments match the elongation
of cluster gas, and the central concentration of low-mass stars. In cluster
centers, condensations require a low volume filling factor to produce massive
stars with short spacing. These may have stellate shape, where cores are nodes
of filamentary networks, as seen in some simulations of colliding flows and of
collapsing turbulent clumps. A dense configuration of such stellate

transmission rates between nodes and transmission sources are unknown.
Inferring the underlying dynamics is of outstanding interest since it enables
forecasting, influencing and retarding infections, broadly construed. To this
end, we model diffusion processes as discrete networks of continuous temporal
processes occurring at different rates. Given cascade data -- observed
infection times of nodes -- we infer the edges of the global diffusion network
and estimate the transmission rates of each edge that best explain the observed
data. The optimization problem is convex. The model naturally (without
heuristics) imposes sparse solutions and requires no parameter tuning. The
problem decouples into a collection of independent smaller problems, thus
scaling easily to networks on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes.
Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm both recovers
the edges of diffusion networks and accurately estimates their transmission
rates from cascade data.

and the performance of the formulation for large-scale problems is illustrated
using a representative problem. Two practical and technologically important
problems, one each on enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon-dioxide

examples show that the predictions based on Darcy model are qualitatively and
quantitatively different from that of the predictions based on the modified
Darcy model, which takes into account the dependence of the viscosity on the
pressure. In particular, the numerical example on the geological carbon-dioxide
sequestration shows that Darcy model over-predicts the leakage into an
abandoned well when compared to that of the modified Darcy model. On the other
hand, the modified Darcy model predicts higher pressures and higher pressure
gradients near the injection well. These predictions have dire consequences in
predicting damage and fracture zones, and designing the seal, whose integrity

agents to achieve goals that they may not have been able to achieve on their

computationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 2006)
studied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision
problems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) - games in which each agent is
endowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals
if they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The
input of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g.,
the agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot, Aumann and
Kraus (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using
the theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not
all parts of input act equal - some instances of the problem are indeed
tractable while others still remain intractable.
  We answer an important question left open by Shrot, Aumann and Kraus by
showing that the SC Problem (checking whether a Coalition is Successful) is
W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the coalition. Then via a single
theme of reduction from SC, we are able to show that various problems related
to resources, resource bounds and resource conflicts introduced by Wooldridge
et al are 1. W[1]-hard or co-W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the
coalition. 2. para-NP-hard or co-para-NP-hard when parameterized by |R|. 3. FPT

the X1.5 flare on 14 December 2006. By using OVSA to calibrate the FST the
source position of the zebra pattern can be located on the solar disk. With the
help of multi-wavelength observations and a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
extrapolation, the zebra source is explored in relation to the magnetic field
configuration. New constraints are placed on the source size and position as a
function of frequency and time. We conclude that the zebra burst is consistent
with a double-plasma resonance (DPR) model in which the radio emission occurs
in resonance layers where the upper hybrid frequency is harmonically related to
the electron cyclotron frequency in a coronal magnetic loop.

and Fermi detected narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) to study the blazar sequence
and inverse Compton (IC) models. I. The synchrotron peak luminosities (L_{s})
significantly inverse correlate with the synchrotron peak frequencies
(\nu_{s}), L_{s}\propto\nu_{s}^{-0.44}, which is consistent with the blazar
sequence. In addition to the correlation, there are some blazars showing low
\nu_{s} and low L_{s}. To study the relation between these low \nu_{s} low
L_{s} blazars and the blazar sequence, we present correlations of the parameter
L_{s}\nu_{s}^{1/4} with the ratio of Compton to synchrotron peak frequencies
(r_{Cs}\equiv\nu_{C}/\nu_{s}) and with the ratio of Compton to synchrotron
luminosities (CD\equiv L_{C}/L_{s}). The results indicate that both
correlations are significant with a Pearson's probability for null correlation
of p=0.0218 and p=0.0286 respectively. This does not support the idea that the
low \nu_{s} low L_{s} blazars are sources with less beaming. Another
possibility, as suggested by Ghisellini & Tavecchio, is that these blazars have
relative lower black hole masses. To test this, we collect the black hole
masses of 30 blazars from archives, and find that the hole mass correlates with
the parameter L_{s}\nu_{s}^{0.44} (p=0.0344). Therefore, the black hole masses
of low \nu_{s} low L_{s} blazars are statistically small. The NLS1s are thought
to have lower black hole masses. We find that the four NLS1s detected by Fermi
have low \nu_{s} and low L_{s}. This supports the above result. II. The ratio
r_{Cs} correlates with CD significantly (p=0.00375). The external Compton (EC)
model can naturally explain this correlation, while synchrotron self Compton
(SSC) model can not. This agrees with the findings of many authors that the EC
process dominates the gamma-ray emission of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars.

of predictability and information loss rate was obtained over the Northern
Hemisphere. In seasonal to interannual time scales, the predictability is low
in lower troposphere and high in mid-upper troposphere. But within mid-upper
subtropics troposphere over some ocean area there is a relatively poor
prediction. The conclusions fit the seasonal time scale too. When it goes to
the interannual time scale, the predictability is high in lower troposphere and
low in mid-upper troposphere contrary to the formers. And on the whole the
interannual trend is more predictable than the seasonal trend. The average
information loss rate is low over mid-east Pacific, west of North America,
Atlantic and Eurasia, and the atmosphere over other places have a relatively
high information loss rate in all time scales. Two channels were found steadily
over the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean in subtropics. There exist unstable
channels as well. The four-season impact on predictability and information
communication was studied too. The predictability is low no matter what season
data are removed and each season plays an important role in the existence of
the channels except the winter. The predictability and teleconnections are
paramount issues in atmospheric science, and the teleconnections may be
established by communication channels. So this work is interesting since it
reveals the vertical structure of predictability distribution and channel
locations, the contribution of different time scales to them and their
variations with different seasons.

Angle-resolved photo emission (ARPES) shows kinks in electronic dispersion
curves at characteristic energies that agree with similar structures in the
optical conductivity and tunnelling spectra. Each technique has its advantages.
ARPES is momentum resolved and offers independent measurements of the real and
imaginary part of the contribution of the bosons to the self energy of the
quasiparticles. The optical conductivity can be used on a larger variety of
materials and with the use of maximum entropy techniques reveals rich details
of the spectra including their evolution with temperature and doping. Scanning
tunnelling spectroscopy offers spacial resolution on the unit cell level. We
find that together the various spectroscopies, including recent Raman results,
are pointing to a unified picture of a broad spectrum of bosonic excitations at
high temperature which evolves, as the temperature is lowered into a peak in
the 30 to 60 meV region and a featureless high frequency background in most of
the materials studied. This behaviour is consistent with the spectrum of spin
fluctuations as measured by magnetic neutron scattering. However, there is
evidence for a phonon contribution to the bosonic spectrum as well.

edge states for the graphene nanoribbons, which lead to the quantum spin Hall
effect(QSHE). Here we investigate the role of the spin-orbit interaction both
for the zigzag and armchair nanoribbons with special care in the edge geometry.
For the pristine zigzag nanoribbons, we have shown that one of the $\sigma$
edge bands located near E=0 lifts up the energy of the spin filtered chiral
edge states at the zone boundary by warping the $\pi$-edge bands, and hence the
QSHE does not occur. Upon increasing the carrier density above a certain
critical value, the spin filtered edge states are formed leading to the QSHE.
We suggest that the hydrogen passivation on the edge can recover the original
feature of the QSHE. For the armchair nanoribbon, the QSHE is shown to be
stable. We have also derived the real space effective hamiltonian, which
demonstrates that the on-site energy and the effective spin orbit coupling
strength are strongly enhanced near the ribbon edges. We have shown that the
steep rise of the confinement potential thus obtained is responsible for the
warping of the $\pi$-edge bands.

the direction given by an initial angle of pi/3, and define 1) a compatible
sequence of piecewise Fagnano orbits, 2) an eventually constant compatible
sequence of orbits and 3) a compatible sequence of generalized piecewise
Fagnano orbits. In the case of the infinite (fractal) billiard table, we will
describe what we call stabilizing periodic orbits of the Koch snowflake fractal
billiard. In a sense, we show that it is possible to define billiard dynamics
on a Cantor set. In addition, we will show that the inverse limit of the
footprints of orbits of the prefractal approximations exists in a specific
situation and provide a plausibility argument as to why such an inverse limit
of footprints should constitute the footprint of a well-defined periodic orbit
of the fractal billiard. Using known results for the inverse limit of a
sequence of finite spaces, we deduce that the footprint (i.e., the intersection
of the orbit with the boundary) of a piecewise Fagnano orbit is a topological
Cantor set and a self-similar Cantor set. We allude to a possible
characterization of orbits with an initial direction of pi/3. Such a
characterization would allow one to describe an orbit with an initial direction
of pi/3 of the Koch snowflake billiard as either a piecewise Fagnano orbit, a
stabilizing orbit or a generalized piecewise Fagnano orbit. We then close the
paper by discussing several outstanding open problems and conjectures about the
Koch snowflake fractal billiard, the associated 'fractal flat surface', and
possible connections with the associated fractal drum. In the long-term, the
present work may help lay the foundations for a general theory of fractal

  Access Networks","13 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the increasing demand of capacity in wireless cellular networks, the
small cells such as pico and femto cells are becoming more popular to enjoy a
spatial reuse gain, and thus cells with different sizes are expected to coexist
in a complex manner. In such a heterogeneous environment, the role of
interference management (IM) becomes of more importance, but technical
challenges also increase, since the number of cell-edge users, suffering from
severe interference from the neighboring cells, will naturally grow. In order
to overcome low performance and/or high complexity of existing static and other
dynamic IM algorithms, we propose a novel low-complex and fully distributed IM
scheme, called REFIM, in the downlink of heterogeneous multi-cell networks. We
first formulate a general optimization problem that turns out to require
intractable computation complexity for global optimality. To have a practical
solution with low computational and signaling overhead, which is crucial for
low-cost small-cell solutions, e.g., femto cells, in REFIM, we decompose it
into per-BS problems based on the notion of reference user and reduce feedback
overhead over backhauls both temporally and spatially. We evaluate REFIM
through extensive simulations under various configurations, including the
scenarios from a real deployment of BSs. We show that, compared to the schemes
without IM, REFIM can yield more than 40% throughput improvement of cell-edge
users while increasing the overall performance by 10~107%. This is equal to
about 95% performance of the existing centralized IM algorithm that is known to
be near-optimal but hard to implement in practice due to prohibitive
complexity. We also present that as long as interference is managed well, the
spectrum sharing policy can outperform the best spectrum splitting policy where
the number of subchannels is optimally divided between macro and femto cells.

mass-accreting white dwarf is expected to experience a supersoft X-ray source
(SSS) phase. However, some recent observations showed that the expected number
of the mass-accreting WD is much lower than that predicted from theory,
whatever in spiral or elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we did a binary
population synthesis study on the relative duration of the SSS phase to their
whole mass-increasing phase of WDs leading to SNe Ia. We found that for about
40% progenitor systems, the relative duration is shorter than 2% and the
evolution of the mean relative duration shows that it is always smaller than
5%, whatever for young or old SNe Ia. In addition, before SNe Ia explosion,
more than 55% progenitor systems are experiencing a dwarf novae phase, and only
no more than 10% is staying SSS phase. These results are consistent with the
recent observations, and imply that both in early- and late-type galaxies, only
a small fraction of mass-accreting WD resulting in SNe Ia contribute to the
supersoft X-ray flux. So, although our results are not directly related to the
X-ray output of SN Ia progenitor, the low supersoft X-ray luminosity observed
in early type galaxies may have no ability to exclude the validity of SD model.
On the contrary, it is evidence to support the SD scenario.

more attention on whether they are competing in the fair environment. No matter
how fierce the debates are in the game-design community, it is rarely the case
that one employs statistical analysis to answer this question seriously. But
considering the fact that we can easily gather large amount of user behavior
data on games, it seems potentially beneficial to make use of this data to aid
making decisions on design problems of games. Actually, modern games do not aim
to perfectly design the game at once: rather, they first release the game, and
then monitor users' behavior to better balance the game. In such a scenario,
statistical analysis can be particularly helpful. Specifically, we chose to
analyze the balance of StarCraft II, which is a very successful
recently-released real-time strategy (RTS) game. It is a central icon in
current e-Sports and professional gaming community: from April 1st to 15th,
there were 18 tournaments of StarCraft II. However, there is endless debate on
whether the winner of the tournament is actually superior to others, or it is
largely due to certain design flaws of the game. In this paper, we aim to
answer such a question using traditional statistical tool, logistic regression.

polarities and reversal of the horizontal magnetic field component as
signatures of the emergence of a twisted flux tube within the active region and
along its internal polarity inversion line (PIL). A filament is observed along
the PIL and the active region is assumed to have an arcade structure. To
investigate this scenario, MacTaggart and Hood ({\it Astrophys. J. Lett.} {\bf
716}, 219, 2010) constructed a dynamic flux emergence model of a twisted
cylinder emerging into an overlying arcade. The photospheric signatures
observed by Okamoto {\it et al.} (2008, 2009) are present in the model although
their underlying physical mechanisms differ. The model also produces two
additional signatures that can be verified by the observations. The first is an
increase in the unsigned magnetic flux in the photosphere at either side of the
PIL. The second is the behaviour of characteristic photospheric flow profiles
associated with twisted flux tube emergence. We look for these two signatures
in AR 10953 and find negative results for the emergence of a twisted flux tube
along the PIL. Instead, we interpret the photospheric behaviour along the PIL
to be indicative of photospheric magnetic cancellation driven by flows from the
dominant sunspot. Although we argue against flux emergence within this
particular region, the work demonstrates the important relationship between
theory and observations for the successful discovery and interpretation of
signatures of flux emergence.

crucial objects in planet formation studies. Thus far, only a few disks

Our aim is to determine the dust evolution and the lifetime of the disks
associated with Herbig Ae stars. We imaged the continuum emission at 3 mm and
1.3 mm of the Herbig Ae/Be stars BD+61154, RR Tau, VY Mon and LkHa 198 using
the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). These stars are in the upper end of
the stellar mass range of the Herbig Ae stars (stellar mass greater than 3
solar masses). Our measurements were used to complete the Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED). The modelling of the SED, in particular the FIR-mm part,
allow us to determine the masses and dust properties of these disks. We
detected the disks associated with BD+61154, RR Tau and VY Mon with disk masses
of 0.35 Msun, 0.05 Msun and 0.40 Msun respectively. The disk around LkHa 198
was not detected with an upper limit to the disk mass of 0.004 Msun. We
detected, however, the disks associated with the younger stellar objects LkHa
198--IR and LkHa 198-mm that are located in the vicinity of LkHa 198. The
fitting of the mm part of the SED reveal that the grains in the mid-plane of
the disks around BD+61154, RR Tau and VY Mon have sizes of 1--1000 microns.
Therefore, grains have not grown to centimetre sizes in these disks yet. These
massive (M>3 Msun) and young (about 1 Myr) HAe stars are surrounded by massive
(>0.04 Msun) disks with grains of micron-millimetre sizes. Although grain
growth is proceeding in these disks, their evolutionary stage is prior to the
formation of planetesimals. These disks are less evolved than those detected
around T Tauri and Herbig Be stars.

observation is associated with an unobserved label that we want to retrieve.
More precisely, we assume that there are two groups of observation: normal and
abnormal. The `normal' observations are coming from a known distribution
whereas the distribution of the `abnormal' observations is unknown. Several
models have been developed to fit this unknown distribution. In this paper, we
propose an alternative based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The
inference is done within a variational Bayesian framework and our aim is to
infer the posterior probability of belonging to the class of interest. To this
end, it makes no sense to estimate the mixture component number since each
mixture model provides more or less relevant information to the posterior
probability estimation. By computing a weighted average (named aggregated
estimator) over the model collection, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is one way
of combining models in order to account for information provided by each model.
The aim is then the estimation of the weights and the posterior probability for
one specific model. In this work, we derive optimal approximations of these
quantities from the variational theory and propose other approximations of the
weights. To perform our method, we consider that the data are dependent
(Markovian dependency) and hence we consider a Hidden Markov Model. A
simulation study is carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the estimates in
terms of classification. We also present an application to the analysis of
public health surveillance systems.

atoms quasi-bound by the centrifugal barrier imposed by the angular momentum
involved in the collision. The temporary trapping of the atoms' scattering
wavefunction corresponds to an enhanced atom pair density at low interatomic
separations. This leads to larger overlap of the wavefunctions involved in a
molecule formation process such as photoassociation, rendering the process more
efficient. However, for an ensemble of atoms, the atom pair density will only
be enhanced if the energy of the resonance comes close to the temperature of
the atomic ensemble. Herein we explore the possibility of controlling the
energy of a shape resonance by shifting it toward the temperature of atoms
confined in a trap. The shifts are imparted by the interaction of non-resonant
light with the anisotropic polarizability of the atom pair, which affects both
the centrifugal barrier and the pair's rotational and vibrational levels. We
find that at laser intensities of up to $5\times 10^{9}$ W/cm$^2$ the pair
density is increased by one order of magnitude for $^{87}$Rb atoms at $100

remove the effects of the interplay. We have shown that for the pseudoscalar

exhibiting considerable am dependence which appears to be a manifestation of

characterizes the lensing geometry. When $\bar {\lambda}$ is close to zero,

maximal deflection angle $\delta_{max}$, a feature inexistent in the

properties on important information theoretic quantities such as entropy,
divergence, and capacity. We prove two maximum entropy theorems that strengthen
previously known results. The proof of the former theorem is based on the
so-called circular analog of a given complex-valued random vector. Its
introduction is supported by a characterization theorem that employs a minimum
Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. In the proof of latter theorem, on the
other hand, results about the second-order structure of complex-valued random
vectors are exploited. Furthermore, we address the capacity of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Regardless of the specific distribution of the
channel parameters (noise vector and channel matrix, if modeled as random), we
show that the capacity-achieving input vector is circular for a broad range of
MIMO channels (including coherent and noncoherent scenarios). Finally, we
investigate the situation of an improper and Gaussian distributed noise vector.
We compute both capacity and capacity-achieving input vector and show that
improperness increases capacity, provided that the complementary covariance
matrix is exploited. Otherwise, a capacity loss occurs, for which we derive an
explicit expression.

essential for a full theory of stellar evolution. However the binary properties
of massive stars - frequency, mass ratio and orbital separation - are still
poorly constrained. In order to address this shortcoming we have undertaken a
multiepoch spectroscopic study of the stellar population of the young massive
cluster Westerlund 1. In this paper we present an investigation into the nature
of the dusty Wolf-Rayet star and candidate binary W239. We determined an
orbital period of only 5.05 days - making it one of the most compact WC
binaries yet identified - while we interpret a significant near-IR flare
between 2004-6 as evidence for a third massive stellar component in the system
in a wide eccentric orbit. The presence of a near-IR excess characteristic of
hot dust at every epoch is consistent with the expectation that the subset of
persistent dust forming WC stars are short period binaries. In conjunction with
previous results, the simultaneous presence of both short period Wolf-Rayet
binaries and cool hypergiants within Wd 1 provides compelling evidence for a
bifurcation in the post-Main Sequence evolution of massive stars due to
binarity. Short period O+OB binaries will evolve directly to the Wolf-Rayet
phase, either due to an episode of binary mediated mass loss or via chemically
homogenous evolution. Conversely, long period binaries and single stars will
instead undergo a red loop across the HR diagram via a cool hypergiant phase.
Future analysis of the full spectroscopic dataset for Wd 1 will constrain the
proportion of massive stars experiencing each pathway; hence quantifying the
importance of binarity in massive stellar evolution up to and beyond supernova
and the resultant production of relativistic remnants and X-ray binaries.

as a function of the acceptor:donor ratio, generating FRET saturation curves.
Modeling these curves by Michaelis-Menten kinetics allows characterization by
two parameters, which serve to evaluate apparent affinity between two proteins
and to compare this affinity in different experimental conditions. To reduce
the effect of sampling variability, several statistical samples of the
saturation curve are generated in the same biological conditions. Here we study
three procedures to determine whether statistical samples in a collection are
homogeneous, in the sense that they are extracted from the same regression
model. From the hypothesis testing viewpoint, we considered an F test and a
procedure based on bootstrap resampling. The third method analyzed the problem
from the model selection viewpoint, and used the Akaike information criterion
(AIC). Although we only considered the Michaelis-Menten model, all statistical
procedures would be applicable to any other nonlinear regression model. We
compared the performance of the homogeneity testing methods in a Monte Carlo
study and through analysis in living cells of FRET saturation curves for
dimeric complexes of CXCR4, a seven-transmembrane receptor of the G
protein-coupled receptor family. We show that the F test, the bootstrap
procedure and the model selection method lead in general to similar
conclusions, although AIC gave the best results when sample sizes were small,
whereas the F test and the bootstrap method were more appropriate for large

regarding the minimum number of vertices of a strongly regular graph whose
removal disconnects the graph into non-singleton components.
  We show that strongly regular graphs constructed from copolar spaces and from
the more general spaces called $\Delta$-spaces are counterexamples to Brouwer's
Conjecture. Using J.I. Hall's characterization of finite reduced copolar
spaces, we find that the triangular graphs $T(m)$, the symplectic graphs
$Sp(2r,q)$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$ (for any $q$ prime power), and the
strongly regular graphs constructed from the hyperbolic quadrics $O^{+}(2r,2)$
and from the elliptic quadrics $O^{-}(2r,2)$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$,
respectively, are counterexamples to Brouwer's Conjecture. For each of these
graphs, we determine precisely the minimum number of vertices whose removal
disconnects the graph into non-singleton components. While we are not aware of
an analogue of Hall's characterization theorem for $\Delta$-spaces, we show
that complements of the point graphs of certain finite generalized quadrangles
are point graphs of $\Delta$-spaces and thus, yield other counterexamples to
Brouwer's Conjecture.
  We prove that Brouwer's Conjecture is true for many families of strongly
regular graphs including the conference graphs, the generalized quadrangles
$GQ(q,q)$ graphs, the lattice graphs, the Latin square graphs, the strongly
regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue -2 (except the triangular graphs) and
the primitive strongly regular graphs with at most 30 vertices except for few
cases.
  We leave as an open problem determining the best general lower bound for the
minimum size of a disconnecting set of vertices of a strongly regular graph,
whose removal disconnects the graph into non-singleton components.

neglecting the quantum potential (QP) leads to a singular behavior of quantum

in turn gives rise to the Hawking radiation. The neglect of QP is well founded
at not too small distances $|x| \gg l_h$ from the horizon, where $l_h$ is the

micro-structure with anisotropic stress when a material is subject to strain.
The anisotropic stress due to a constant strain-rate load in a cross-linked
polymer is primarily dependent on the mean-square bond length and mean-square
bond angle. Excluded volume interactions due to chain stacking and spatial
distribution also has a bearing on the stress response. The bond length
distribution along the chain is not uniform. Rather, the bond lengths at the
end of the chains are larger and uniformly decrease towards the middle of the
chain from both ends. The effect is due to the presence of cross-linkers. As
with linear polymers, at high density values, changes in mean-square bond
length dominates over changes in radius of gyration and end-to-end length. That
is, bond deformations dominate over changes in size and shape. A large change
in the mean-square bond length reflects in a jump in the stress response.
Short-chain polymers more or less behave like rigid molecules. Temperature has
a peculiar effect on the response in the sense that even though bond lengths
increase with temperature, stress response decreases with increasing
temperature. This is due to the dominance of excluded volume effects which
result in lower stresses at higher temperatures. At low strain rates, some
relaxation in the bond stretch is observed from $\epsilon=0.2$ to
$\epsilon=0.5$. At high strain rates, internal deformation of the chains
dominate over their uncoiling leading to a rise in the stress levels.

longitudinal direction of the chain and by an infinite range interaction in the
direction transverse to the chain. Our motivations for studying this model come
from recent findings in the theory of error correcting codes based on spatially
coupled graphs. We find that, although much simpler than the codes, the model
studied here already displays similar behaviors. We are interested in the van
der Waals curve in a regime where the size of each Curie-Weiss model tends to
infinity, and the length of the chain and range of the Kac interaction are
large but finite. Below the critical temperature, and with appropriate boundary
conditions, there appears a series of equilibrium states representing kink-like
interfaces between the two equilibrium states of the individual system. The van
der Waals curve oscillates periodically around the Maxwell plateau. These
oscillations have a period inversely proportional to the chain length and an
amplitude exponentially small in the range of the interaction; in other words
the spinodal points of the chain model lie exponentially close to the phase
transition threshold. The amplitude of the oscillations is closely related to a
Peierls-Nabarro free energy barrier for the motion of the kink along the chain.
Analogies to similar phenomena and their possible algorithmic significance for
graphical models of interest in coding theory and theoretical computer science

stellar winds around Teff ~ 21,000 K. Decisive evidence is provided by huge
changes in the optical depth of the Lyman continuum in the inner wind as Teff
changes during the S Dor cycle. These changes cause different Fe ionization
structures in the inner wind. The bistability mechanism is also related to the
different wind parameters during visual minima: the wind terminal velocity was
2-3 times higher and the mass-loss rate roughly two times smaller in 1985-1990
than in 2000-2003. We obtain a projected rotational velocity of 220 +- 50 km/s

puts AG Car extremely close to the Eddington limit modified by rotation

M< 60 Msun. Based on evolutionary models and mass budget, we obtain an initial
mass of ~ 100 Msun and a current mass of 60-70 Msun for AG Car. Therefore, AG
Car is close to, if not at, the Omega-Gamma limit during visual minimum.
Assuming M=70 Msun, we find that Gamma_Omega decreases from 0.93 to 0.72 as AG
Car expands toward visual maximum, suggesting that the star is not above the

the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such
large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation
offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available
imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or
categorical. For mixed-type data the different types are usually handled
separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable
types. We propose a nonparametric method which can cope with different types of
variables simultaneously. We compare several state of the art methods for the
imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation
method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned
classification or regression trees random forest intrinsically constitutes a
multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of
random forest we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of
a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple data sets coming from a diverse
selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values
ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle
missing values, particularly in data sets including different types of
variables. In our comparative study missForest outperforms other methods of
imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and nonlinear
relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of
missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest
exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional
data.

be efficiently controlled but their ratio remains constant. Thus, an
""uncertainty principle"" can be formulated: the loss of reliability occurs when
coherence is enhanced and, vice versa, coherence is weakened when reliability
is enhanced. Treatment of this principle for ensembles of oscillators
synchronized by common noise or global coupling reveals a substantial
difference between the cases of slightly non-identical oscillators and
identical ones with intrinsic noise.

application areas such as social networks, co-citation graphs or road networks.
In the majority of applications, each edge in a network is associated with a
certain cost and an optimal way minimizes the cost while fulfilling a certain
property, e.g connecting a start and a destination node. In this paper, we want
to extend pure cost networks to so-called cost-gain networks. In this type of
network, each edge is additionally associated with a certain gain. Thus, a way
having a certain cost additionally provides a certain gain. In the following,
we will discuss the problem of finding ways providing maximal gain while
costing less than a certain budget. An application for this type of problem is
the round trip problem of a traveler: Given a certain amount of time, which is
the best round trip traversing the most scenic landscape or visiting the most
important sights? In the following, we distinguish two cases of the problem.
The first does not control any redundant edges and the second allows a more
sophisticated handling of edges occurring more than once. To answer the maximum
round trip queries on a given graph data set, we propose unidirectional and
bidirectional search algorithms. Both types of algorithms are tested for the
use case named above on real world spatial networks.

from the accretion disk from cataclysmic variables (CVs). The disk is separated
into concentric rings, with an internal structure from the Wade & Hubeny
disk-atmosphere models. For each ring, a wind atmosphere is calculated in the
co-moving frame with a vertical velocity structure obtained from a solution of
the Euler equation. Using simple assumptions, regarding rotation and the wind
streamlines, these 1D models are combined into a single 2.5D model for which we
compute synthetic spectra. We find that the resulting line and continuum
behavior as a function of the orbital inclination is consistent with the
observations, and verify that the accretion rate affects the wind temperature,
leading to corresponding trends in the intensity of UV lines. In general, we
also find that the primary mass has a strong effect on the P-Cygni absorption
profiles, the synthetic emission line profiles are strongly sensitive to the
wind temperature structure, and an increase in the mass loss rate enhances the
resonance line intensities. Synthetic spectra were compared with UV data for
two high orbital inclination nova-like CVs - RW Tri and V347 Pup. We needed to
include disk regions with arbitrary enhanced mass loss to reproduce reasonably
well widths and line profiles. This fact and a lack of flux in some high
ionization lines may be the signature of the presence of density enhanced
regions in the wind, or alternatively, may result from inadequacies in some of
our simplifying assumptions.

matter. A model of interaction has been studied with scalar field and the
inhomogeneous ideal fluid. Two forms of the ideal fluid have been analysed. A

equations for the energy densities. Brans-Dicke theory has been used to
