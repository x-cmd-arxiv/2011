Interstellar Clouds resembles the highly-studied turbulence in the solar corona
and the solar wind. The turbulence diagnostics for the Local Clouds are the
absorption line widths measured along 32 lines of sight to nearby stars,
yielding measurements for 53 absorption components (Redfield and Linsky 2004).
We have tested whether the Local Cloud turbulence has the following properties
of turbulence in the solar corona or the solar wind: (a) velocity fluctuations
mainly perpendicular to the average magnetic field, (b) a temperature
anisotropy in the sense that the perpendicular temperature is larger than the
parallel temperature (or at least enhanced relative to expectation), and (c) an
ion temperature which is dependent on the ion Larmor radius, in the sense that
more massive ions have higher temperatures. Our analysis of the data does not
show compelling evidence for any of these properties in Local Cloud turbulence,
indicating possible differences with heliospheric plasmas. In the case of
anisotropy of velocity fluctuations, although the expected observational
signature is not seen, we cannot exclude the possibility of relatively high
degrees of anisotropy (anisotropy parameter $\epsilon \sim 0.50 - 0.70$), if
some other process in the the Local Clouds is causing variations in the
turbulent line width from one line of sight to another. We briefly consider
possible reasons for differences between coronal and solar wind turbulence and
that in the Local Clouds.

of superconductivity for underdoped cuprates. We implement the no-double
occupancy constraint with a (semionic) slave-particle formalism. The dopant
generates a vortex-like quantum distortion of the AF background centered on the
empty sites, with opposite chirality for cores on the two N\'eel sublattices.
Empty sites are described in terms of spinless fermionic holons and the
long-range attraction between spin vortices on two opposite N\'eel sublattices
is the holon pairing force, leading eventually to SC. The spin fluctuations are
described by bosonic spinons with a gap generated by scattering on spin
vortices. Due to the occupation constraint, there is a gauge attraction between
holon and spinon, binding them into a physical hole. Through gauge interaction
the spin vortex attraction induces the formation of spin-singlet RVB pairs
reducing the spinon gap. Lowering T, there are two crossovers as precursors of
the SC transition: at the higher one a gas of holon pairs appears, reducing the
hole spectral weight, while at the lower one a gas of spinon pairs also
appears, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs with magnetic
vortices in the plasma phase, supporting a Nernst signal. At an even lower T
the hole pairs become coherent and SC appears beyond a critical doping. The
proposed SC mechanism is not of the BCS-type, because it involves a gain in
kinetic energy (lowering of spinon gap) and it is ""almost"" of the classical 3D
XY-type. Since both the spinon gap and the holon pairing originate from the
same term in the slave-particle representation of the t-J model, this approach
incorporates a strong interplay between AF and SC, giving rise to a universal
relation between Tc and the energy of the resonance mode, as observed in
neutron scattering experiments.

consider a family of exact solutions to the theory, corresponding to
generalized coherent Gaussian and squeezed states. We analyze the behavior of
basic physical observables and impose restrictions on the states based on
physical considerations. These turn out to be enough to select, from all the
generalized coherent states, those that behave semiclassical at late times. We
study then the properties of such states near the bounce where the most
`quantum behavior' is expected. As it turns out, the states remain sharply
peaked and semiclassical at the bounce and the dynamics is very well
approximated by the `effective theory' throughout the time evolution. We
compare the semiclassicality properties of squeezed states to those of the
Gaussian semiclassical states and conclude that the Gaussians are better

after the bounce are negligible, thus ruling out claims of so called `cosmic

hypersurface in context of the MBDT. We illustrate that if the usual spatial
scale factors are functions of time while scale factor of extra dimension is
constant, and scalar field depends on time and fifth coordinate, then in
general, one will encounter inconsistencies in field equations. Then, we assume
the scale factors and scalar field depend on time and extra coordinate as
separated variables in power law forms. Hence, we find a few classes of
solutions in 5D spacetime through which, we probe the one which leads to a
generalized Kasner relations among Kasner parameters. The induced scalar
potential is found to be in power law or in logarithmic form, however, for
constant scaler field and even when scalar field only depends on fifth
coordinate, it vanishes. The conservation law is indeed valid in this MBDT
approach for derived induced energy momentum tensor (EMT). We proceed our
investigations for a few cosmological quantities, where for simplicity we
assume metric and scalar field are functions of time. Hence, the EMT satisfies
barotropic equation of state, and the model indicates that constant mean Hubble
parameter is not allowed. Thus, by appealing to variation of Hubble parameter,
we assume a fixed deceleration parameter, and set evolution of quantities with
respect to the fixed deceleration, BD coupling and state parameters. The WEC
allows a shrinking extra dimension for decelerating expanding universe that, in
the constant scalar field, evolves same as flat FRW spacetime in GR.

about the dynamics. The main difference to the unforced situation is that at
the critical bifurcation parameter, two alternatives exist. In addition to the
possibility of a unique neutral invariant graph, corresponding to a neutral
fixed point, a pair of so-called pinched invariant graphs may occur. In
quasiperiodically forced systems, these are often referred to as 'strange
non-chaotic attractors'. The results on deterministic forcing can be considered
as an extension of the work of Novo, Nunez, Obaya and Sanz on nonautonomous
convex scalar differential equations. As a by-product, we also give a
generalisation of a result by Sturman and Stark on the structure of minimal
sets in forced systems.

gravity-wave distortions can drive propagating electromagnetic signals. Since
forced oscillations provide the natural stage for resonances to occur,
gravito-electromagnetic resonances have been investigated as a means of more
efficient gravity-wave detection methods. In this report, we consider the
coupling between the Weyl and the Maxwell fields on a Minkowski background,
which also applies to astrophysical environments where gravity is weak, at the
second perturbative level. We use covariant methods that describe gravitational
waves via the transverse component of the shear, instead of pure-tensor metric
perturbations. The aim is to calculate the properties of the electromagnetic
signal, which emerges from the interaction of its linear counterpart with an
incoming gravitational wave. Our analysis shows how the wavelength and the
amplitude of the gravitationally driven electromagnetic wave vary with the
initial conditions. More specifically, for certain initial data, the amplitude
of the induced electromagnetic signal is found to diverge. Analogous,
diverging, gravito-electromagnetic resonances were also reported in cosmology.
Given that, we extend our Minkowski-space study to cosmology and discuss
analogies and differences in the physics and in the phenomenology of the
Weyl-Maxwell coupling between the aforementioned two physical environments.

solving its linear programming relaxation, when the simplicial complex
satisfies a simple topological condition (absence of relative torsion). Our
most significant contribution is the simplicial deformation theorem, which
states that one may approximate a general current with a simplicial current
while bounding the expansion of its mass. We present explicit bounds on the

closer to the original current as we make the simplicial complex finer. The
multiscale simplicial flat norm opens up the possibilities of using flat norm

Polana the largest member of this group. The effect of the forced secular modes
superposed to the resonance gives rise to a complex dynamical evolution.
Chaotic diffusion, collisions, close encounters with massive asteroids and
mainly orbital migration due to the Yarkovsky effect generate continuous
captures to and losses from the resonance, with a fraction of asteroids
remaining captured over long time scales and generating a concentration in the
semimajor axis distribution that exceeds by 20% the population of background
asteroids. The Yarkovsky effect induces different dynamics according to the
asteroid size, producing an excess of small asteroids inside the resonance. The
evolution in the resonance generates a signature on the orbits, mainly in
eccentricity, that depends on the time the asteroid remains captured inside the
resonance and on the magnitude of the Yarkovsky effect. The greater the
asteroids, the larger the time they remain captured in the resonance, allowing
greater diffusion in eccentricity and inclination. The resonance generates a
discontinuity and mixing in the space of proper elements producing
misidentification of dynamical family members, mainly for Vesta and Nysa-Polana
families. The half-life of resonant asteroids large enough for not being
affected by the Yarkovsky effect is about 1 Gyr. From the point of view of
taxonomic classes, the resonant population does not differ from the background
population and the excess of small asteroids is confirmed.

this model, strong on-site impurity scattering punches localized holes into the
fabric of d-wave superconductivity similar to a Swiss cheese. Already a
two-dimensional impurity concentration of $n_{\rm imp} = 4%$ gives rise to a
pronounced short-range suppression of the order parameter and a suppression of
the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ by roughly 20% compared to its
pure limit value $T_{c0}$, whereas the superfluid density $\rho_s$ is reduced

initiated by high energy photons, electrons and positrons that are emitted by
CRs during their propagation in the cosmic radiation background and are
independent of the simultaneous emission of gamma-rays in the vicinity of the
source. The corresponding production power by UHE CR nuclei (with mass number A

pair production (~ Z^2). We show that the cosmogenic gamma-ray signal from a
single steady UHE CR source is typically more robust with respect to variations
of the source composition and injection spectrum than the accompanying signal
of cosmogenic neutrinos. We study the diffuse emission from the sum of

basic building block in the calculation is a $K\pi$ amplitude based on
unitarized chiral perturbation theory and with parameters determined by a fit
to elastic LASS data. Its analytic extension to the second sheet allows the
determination of two poles, associated with the $\k$ and the $K^*(1430)$, and a
representation of the amplitude based on them is constructed. The problem of
unitarity in the three-body system is formulated in terms of an integral
equation, inspired in the Faddeev formalism, which implements a convolution
between the weak vertex and the final state hadronic interaction. Three
different topologies are considered for the former and, subsequently, the decay
amplitude is expressed as a perturbation series. Each term in this series is
systematically related to the previous one and a re-summation was performed.
Remaining effects owing to single and double rescattering processes were then
added and results compared to FOCUS data. We found that proper three-body
effects are important at threshold and fade away rapidly at higher energies.
  Our model, based on a vector weak vertex, can describe qualitative features
of the modulus of the decay amplitude and agrees well with its phase in the
elastic region.

find that when uncertainties in the scintillation efficiency of Xenon100 have
been accounted for, the resulting exclusion limit is not sufficiently
constraining to rule out the CoGeNT preferred parameter region, contrary to
previous claims. In the same vein, we also investigate the impact of
astrophysical uncertainties on the preferred WIMP parameters. We find that
within the class of smooth and isotropic WIMP velocity distributions, it is
difficult to reconcile the DAMA and the CoGeNT preferred regions by tweaking
the astrophysics parameters alone. If we demand compatibility between these
experiments, then the inference process naturally concludes that a high value
for the sodium quenching factor for DAMA is preferred.

deformations}, i.e., deformations by ambient cycles of symplectic manifolds, of
the Floer homology and quantum cohomology. Essentially the same kind of
construction is independently carried out by Usher [Us4] in a slightly less
general context. Then we explore various applications of these enhancements to
the symplectic topology, especially new construction of symplectic
quasi-states, quasimorphisms and new Lagrangian intersection results on toric
manifolds. The most novel part of this paper is to use open-closed
Gromov-Witten theory (operator $\frak q$ in [FOOO1] and its variant involving
closed orbits of periodic Hamiltonian system) to connect spectral invariants
(with bulk deformation), symplectic quasi-states, quasimorphism to the
Lagrangian Floer theory (with bulk deformation). We use this open-closed
Gromov-Witten theory to produce new examples. Especially using the calculation
of Lagrangian Floer homology with bulk deformation in [FOOO3,FOOO4], we produce
examples of compact toric manifolds $(M,\omega)$ which admits uncountably many

bipolar jet whose blueshifted component is traced optically along P.A.
approximately 295 degrees at separations of 1.5 - 31 arcseconds from the star.
Complex X-ray emission is revealed, including a very soft non-variable spectral
component (some of which may originate in shocks), a superhot flaring component
(T >= 100 MK), and faint extended structure near the star. The structure is
visible in deconvolved images and extends northwestward out to a separation of
1.7 arcseconds, overlapping the inner part of the optical jet. Image analysis
suggests that most of the extension is real, but some contamination by
PSF-induced structure within the central arcsecond may be present. The
predicted temperature for a shock-heated jet based on jet speed and shock speed
estimates from optical measurements is too low to explain the extended X-ray
structure. Either higher speed material within the jet has escaped optical
detection or other mechanisms besides shock-heating are involved. Alternative
mechanisms that could produce higher temperature plasma at small offsets to the
northwest of RY Tau include magnetic heating in the jet, hot plasmoids ejected
at high speeds, or X-ray emission from a putative close companion whose

component before the GRB trigger, has been suggested in order to explain the
shallow decay phase of the X-ray afterglow detected in many Swift GRBs. If this
""prior emission"" is from an external shock, one would expect a corresponding
optical emission component during the GRB prompt emission phase. In this paper
we apply the available prompt optical emission data (both detections and upper
limits) to constrain such a scenario. We fit the shallow and normal decay
segments of the XRT light curves in our sample with a T_\Delta-shifted single
power law, and extrapolate the X-ray flux back to the time of the early optical
observations. We then use the synchrotron spectrum predicted by the standard
external shock model to extrapolate from the X-ray flux to the optical band,
and obtain the possible range of the predicted optical flux. Finally, we
compare the predictions with the observations. In the cases where later optical
data are available, we also compare the shapes of the optical light curves to
the predicted optical light curves from the external shock prior emission
model. We find that for a good fraction of GRBs (4 out of 8; up to December
2006), the available data already impose severe constraints on the hypothesis.
In particular, the expected optical flux from the prior external shock model is
higher than what the data allow. We conclude that if the shallow-decay X-ray
component were from a prior emission component, it would have to be of an
internal origin with optical flux suppressed.

independent sets of a graph with maximum degree Delta. More generally, for an
input graph G=(V,E) and an activity lambda>0, we are interested in the quantity
Z_G(lambda) defined as the sum over independent sets I weighted as w(I) =
lambda^|I|. In statistical physics, Z_G(lambda) is the partition function for
the hard-core model, which is an idealized model of a gas where the particles
have non-negibile size.
  Recently, an interesting phase transition was shown to occur for the
complexity of approximating the partition function. Weitz showed an FPAS for
the partition function for any graph of maximum degree Delta when Delta is
constant and lambda< lambda_c(Tree_Delta):=(Delta-1)^(Delta-1)/(Delta-2)^Delta.
The quantity lambda_c(Tree_Delta) is the critical point for the so-called
uniqueness threshold on the infinite, regular tree of degree Delta. On the
other side, Sly proved that there does not exist efficient (randomized)
approximation algorithms for lambda_c(Tree_Delta) < lambda <
lambda_c(Tree_Delta)+epsilon(Delta), unless NP=RP, for some function
epsilon(Delta)>0. We remove the upper bound in the assumptions of Sly's result

efficient randomized approximation algorithms for all
lambda>lambda_c(Tree_Delta) for Delta=3 and Delta>= 6. Sly's inapproximability
result uses a clever reduction, combined with a second-moment analysis of
Mossel, Weitz and Wormald which prove torpid mixing of the Glauber dynamics for
sampling from the associated Gibbs distribution on almost every regular graph
of degree Delta for the same range of lambda as in Sly's result. We extend
Sly's result by improving upon the technical work of Mossel et al., via a more
detailed analysis of independent sets in random regular graphs.

from the Spitzer/GLIMPSE and 2MASS databases, the WRs were selected via a
method we have established that exploits their unique infrared colors, which is
mainly the result of excess radiation from free-free scattering within their
dense ionized winds. The selection criteria has been refined since our last
report, and now yields WRs at a rate of ~20% in spectroscopic follow-up of
candidates that comprise a broad color space defined by the color distribution
of all known WRs having B>14 mag. However, there are subregions within the
broad color space which yield WRs at a rate of >50%. Cross-correlation of WR
candidates with archival X-ray point-source catalogs increases the WR detection
rate of the broad color space to ~40%; ten new WR X-ray sources have been
found, in addition to a previously unrecognized X-ray counterpart to a known
WR. The extinction values, distances, and galactocentric radii of all new WRs
are calculated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. Although the
majority of the new WRs have no obvious association with stellar clusters, two
WC8 stars reside in a previously unknown massive-star cluster that lies near
the intersection of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm and the Galaxy's bar, in which
five OB supergiants were also identified. In addition, two WC and four WN stars
were identified in association with the stellar clusters Danks 1 and 2. A WN9
star has also been associated with the cluster [DBS2003] 179. This work brings
the total number of known Galactic WRs to 476, or ~7-8% of the total
empirically estimated population. An examination of their Galactic distribution
reveals a tracing of spiral arms and an enhanced WR surface density toward
several massive-star formation sites (abridged).

carrying away invisible energy. The simplest scenario has low-scale SUSY
breaking, with missing energy only from soft gravitinos. This scenario is
natural, lacks artificial tunings to produce a squeezed spectrum, and is
consistent with gauge coupling unification. The resulting collider signals will

so its statistical properties provide estimates of corresponding properties of
the projected 3D pressure fluctuations. It's power spectrum is a sensitive
probe of the density fluctuations, and the bispectrum can be used to separate
the bias associated with pressure. The bispectrum is often probed with a
one-point real-space analogue, the skewness. In addition to the skewness the
morphological properties, as probed by the well known Minkowski Functionals
(MFs), also require the generalized one-point statistics, which at the lowest
order are identical to the skewness parameters. The concept of generalized
skewness parameters can be extended to define a set of three associated
generalized skew-spectra. We use these skew-spectra to probe the morphology of
the tSZ sky or the y-sky. We show how these power spectra can be recovered from
the data in the presence of arbitrary mask and noise templates using the well
known Pseudo-Cl (PCL) approach for arbitrary beam shape. We also employ an
approach based on the halo model to compute the tSZ bispectrum. The bispectrum
from each of these models is then used to construct the generalized
skew-spectra. We consider the performance of an all-sky survey with Planck-type
noise and compare the results against a noise-free ideal experiment using a
range of smoothing angles. We find that the skew-spectra can be estimated with
very high signal-to-noise ratio from future frequency cleaned tSZ maps that
will be available from experiments such as Planck. This will allow their mode
by mode estimation for a wide range of angular frequencies and will help us to
differentiate them from various other sources of non-Gaussianity.

should be thought of as dynamical features that are stationary in a co-rotating
frame for > t_{dyn}, as implied by the density wave approach for explaining
spiral arms. If such spiral arms have enhanced star formation (SF),
observational tracers for different stages of the SF sequence should show a
spatial ordering, from up-stream to downstream in the corotating frame: dense
HI, CO, tracing molecular hydrogen gas, 24 micron emission tracing enshrouded
SF and UV emission tracing unobscured young stars. We argue that such a spatial
ordering should be reflected in the angular cross-correlation (CC, in polar
coordinates) using all azimuthal positions among pairs of these tracers; the
peak of the CC should be offset from zero, in different directions inside and
outside the corotation radius. Recent spiral SF simulations by Dobbs & Pringle,
show explicitly that for the case of a stationary spiral arm potential such
angular offsets between gas and young stars of differing ages should be
observable as cross-correlation offsets. We calculate the angular
cross-correlations for different observational SF sequence tracers in 12 nearby
spiral galaxies, drawing on a data set with high quality maps of the neutral
gas HI, THINGS), molecular gas (CO, HERACLES) along with 24 micron emission
(Spitzer, SINGS); we include FUV images (GALEX) and 3.6 $\mu$m emission
(Spitzer, IRAC) for some galaxies, tracing aging stars and longer timescales.
In none of the resulting tracer cross-correlations for this sample do we find
systematic angular offsets, which would be expected for a stationary dynamical
spiral pattern of well-defined pattern speed. This result indicates that spiral
density waves in their simplest form are not an important aspect of explaining
spirals in large disk galaxies.

Rayleigh scattering, along with a nominal thermal component. This excess
reflection might indicate the presence of a cloud or haze layer in the

Newtonian sources: the quadrupole contribution is altered, in part due to the
different speed of propagation of the tensor modes; furthermore, there is a
monopole contribution stemming from an extra scalar degree of freedom. A dipole

to constrain the low-energy action of Horava gravity by comparing them with the

achieved by this method, relative to the switching time at a constant,
subcritical temperature, is optimal for an intermediate strength of the writing

relevant to recording media with strong perpendicular anisotropy, such as
ultrathin Co/Pt or Co/Pd multilayers.

Population II (Pop II) stars is poorly known due to a lack of observations of
the period between recombination and reionization. In simulations of the
formation of the first stars, it has been shown that, due to the limited
ability of metal-free primordial gas to cool, the IMF of the first stars is a
few orders of magnitude more massive than the current IMF. The transition from
a high-mass IMF of the first stars to a lower-mass current IMF is thus
important to understand. To study the underlying physics of this transition, we
performed several simulations using the cosmological hydrodynamic adaptive mesh
refinement code Enzo for metallicities of 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, and
10^{-1} Z_{\odot}. In our simulations we include a star formation prescription
that is derived from a metallicity dependent multi-phase ISM structure, an
external UV radiation field, and a mechanical feedback algorithm. We also
implement cosmic ray heating, photoelectric heating and gas-dust
heating/cooling, and follow the metal enrichment of the ISM. It is found that
the interplay between metallicity and UV radiation leads to the co-existence of
Pop III and Pop II star formation in non-zero metallicity (Z/Z_{\odot}
\geq10^{-2}) gas. A cold (T<100 K) and dense (\rho>10^{-22} g cm^{-3}) gas
phase is fragile to ambient UV radiation. In a metal-poor (Z/Z_{\odot}
\leq10^{-3}) gas, the cold and dense gas phase does not form in the presence of
a radiation field of F_{0}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-4} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Therefore,
metallicity by itself is not a good indicator of the Pop III-Pop II transition.
Metal-rich (Z/Z_{\odot}\geq10^{-2}) gas dynamically evolves two to three orders
of magnitude faster than metal poor gas (Z/Z_{\odot}\leq10^{-3}). The
simulations including SNe show that pre-enrichment of the halo does not affect
the mixing of metals.

entropy or g-function in two dimensional BCFTs and it agrees with the finite
part of the holographic entanglement entropy. Moreover, we can naturally derive
a holographic g-theorem. We also analyze the holographic dual of an interval at
finite temperature and show that there is a first order phase transition.

interlayer coupling which becomes stronger as the stacking number of CuO_2

phenomenon in underdoped regions when a magnetic interlayer coupling is strong
enough to stabilize an AFM ordering. In addition, we highlight an unusual

glimpse into the dynamics and evolution of a young stellar object (YSO), namely
our Sun. Much of our knowledge about the astrophysical context of the birth of
the Sun, the chronology of planetary growth from micrometer-sized dust to
terrestrial planets, and the activity of the young Sun comes from the study of
extinct radionuclides such as 26Al (t1/2 = 0.717 Myr). Here we review how the
signatures of extinct radionuclides (short-lived isotopes that were present
when the solar system formed and that have now decayed below detection level)
in planetary materials influence the current paradigm of solar system
formation. Particular attention is given to tying meteorite measurements to
remote astronomical observations of YSOs and modeling efforts. Some extinct
radionuclides were inherited from the long-term chemical evolution of the
Galaxy, others were injected into the solar system by a nearby supernova, and
some were produced by particle irradiation from the T-Tauri Sun. The chronology
inferred from extinct radionuclides reveals that dust agglomeration to form
centimeter-sized particles in the inner part of the disk was very rapid (<50
kyr), planetesimal formation started early and spanned several million years,
planetary embryos (possibly like Mars) were formed in a few million years, and
terrestrial planets (like Earth) completed their growths several tens of
million years after the birth of the Sun.

place during the cosmic history of the universe. In the Bose-Einstein
Condensation model, dark matter can be described as a non-relativistic,
Newtonian gravitational condensate, whose density and pressure are related by a
barotropic equation of state, with barotropic index equal to one. In the
present work, we study the Bose-Einstein Condensation process in a cosmological
context, by assuming that this process can be described (at least
approximately) as a first order phase transition. We analyze the evolution of
the physical quantities relevant for the physical description of the early
universe, namely, the energy density, temperature and scale factor, before,
during and after the Bose-Einstein Condensation (phase transition). We also
consider in detail the epoch when the universe evolved through a mixed
condensate - normal dark matter phase, with a monotonically growing
Bose-Einstein dark matter component. An important parameter characterizing the
Bose-Einstein Condensation is the condensate dark matter fraction, whose time
evolution describes the time dynamics of the conversion process. The behavior
of this parameter during the cosmological condensation process is also analyzed
in detail. To study the cosmological dynamics and evolution we use both
analytical and numerical methods. The presence of the condensate dark matter
and of the Bose-Einstein phase transition could have modified drastically the
cosmological evolution of the early universe, as well as the large scale
structure formation process.

Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, there have developed many microscopic pictures,
some of them are based on the theories that themselves remain to be
experimentally verified, while some cite the Hawking temperature formula and
actually argue in circle (and then they have not provided more information than
the seminal work of Bekenstein and Hawking). Within quantum field theory in
curved spacetime (without introducing any new hypothesis), it is inevitable for
us to attribute the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy to entanglement entropy. In the
first part we just provide a heuristic argument, a rigorous theoretical model
will be presented in our next work.

for normal incidence, when a mirror symmetry normal to the junction is

between the nucleus and its emitted nucleons. The microscopic structure of the
GMR is investigated with the decomposition of the strength function into
individual single-particles quantum numbers. A similar microscopic
decomposition of the spectra of emitted nucleons by direct decay of the GMR is
performed. In this harmonic picture of giant resonance, shifting every
contribution by the initial single-particle energy allows to reconstruct the
GMR strength function. The RPA residual interaction couples bound 1-particle
1-hole states to unbound ones, allowing for the total decay of the GMR. In this

complex configurations. Time-dependent beyond mean-field approaches should be
use, in the future, to extend this method.

We also give an efficient deterministic algorithm that runs in $O(n^2k)$ time

  An important consequence of the above result is that if the crossing number
of a graph $G$ is $t$, then $\boxi(G)$ is $O(t^{1/4}{\lceil\log

We also show that, if $G$ has $n$ vertices, then $\cubi(G)$ is $O(\log n +
t^{1/4}\log t)$.
  Using our bound for the cubicity of $k$-degenerate graphs we show that
cubicity of almost all graphs in $\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ model is $O(d_{av}\log n)$,

a critical compressibility above which the drops (and disks) become unstable
for a spherical perturbation. For a given value of compressibility (and those
of the surface tension and density at the equilibrium), this instability
criterion provides a minimal radius below which the drop cannot be a stable

changes. In particular, we identify another critical compressibility above

the structure and properties of today's complex networks such as the Internet.
This paper studies the feasibility and infeasibility of inferring the network
topology given traceroute data from a worst-case perspective, i.e., without any
probabilistic assumptions on, e.g., the nodes' degree distribution. We attend
to a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose two
fundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the traceroute data: (1)
each trace corresponds to a real path in the network, and (2) the routing paths
are at most a factor 1/alpha off the shortest paths, for some parameter alpha
in (0,1]. In contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of
the set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that a large
number of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic, as long as the
networks have a similar structure. We hence seek to characterize the set of
topologies inferred with our axioms. We introduce the notion of star graphs
whose colorings capture the differences among inferred topologies; it also
allows us to construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general,
inferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important aspects, such
as the nodes' distances or the number of triangles. These negative results are
complemented by a discussion of a scenario where the trace set is best
possible, i.e., ""complete"". It turns out that while some properties such as the
node degrees are still hard to measure, a complete trace set can help to
determine global properties such as the connectivity.

find that both superclusters and supervoids can decrease the temperature of the
CMB by several micro Kelvin in the central region and increase the temperature
slightly in the surrounding area due to the RS effect. The two components of
the RS effect, redshift and gravitational time delay, largely cancel each
other, leaving an equivalent but much smaller effect on the CMB photons that
started out at the same time from the distorted last scattering surface. For
galaxies, the time delay effect is separable from the redshift effect, and the
slight change to the redshift induced by super structures can be at the percent
level of large-scale rms bulk velocities, which might only be detected
statistically. On much smaller scales, a tiny redshift difference between two
images of a strongly lensed source should exist in general, which is related to
the Hubble expansion rate at the source redshift. However, as Loeb (1998)
pointed out, observational issues and the proper motion of the structure would
make such a measurement impossible.

Gaussian and non-Gaussian regression models, with predictors comprising
arbitrary combinations of nonlinear functions and surfaces, spatial effects,
varying coefficients, random effects and further regression terms. The large
flexibility of structured additive regression makes function selection a
challenging and important task, aiming at (1) selecting the relevant
covariates, (2) choosing an appropriate and parsimonious representation of the
impact of covariates on the predictor and (3) determining the required
interactions. We propose a spike-and-slab prior structure for function
selection that allows to include or exclude single coefficients as well as
blocks of coefficients representing specific model terms. A novel
multiplicative parameter expansion is required to obtain good mixing and
convergence properties in a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation approach and is
shown to induce desirable shrinkage properties. In simulation studies and with
(real) benchmark classification data, we investigate sensitivity to
hyperparameter settings and compare performance to competitors. The flexibility
and applicability of our approach are demonstrated in an additive piecewise
exponential model with time-varying effects for right-censored survival times
of intensive care patients with sepsis. Geoadditive and additive mixed logit
model applications are discussed in an extensive appendix.

magnetization in solids-often referred to as the ""modern theory of orbital

orbital magnetization in finite systems such as atoms and molecules is straight
forward, in extended systems or solids it has long eluded calculations owing to
the fact that the position operator is ill-defined in such a context.
Approaches that overcome this problem were first developed in 2005 and in the
first part of this review we present the main ideas reaching from a Wannier
function approach to semi-classical and finite-temperature formalisms. In the
second part, we describe practical aspects of calculating the orbital
magnetization, such as taking k-space derivatives, a formalism for
pseudopotentials, a single k-point derivation, a Wannier interpolation scheme,
and DFT specific aspects. We then show results of recent calculations on Fe,
Co, and Ni. In the last part of this review, we focus on direct applications of
the orbital magnetization. In particular, we will review how properties such as
the nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensor and the electron paramagnetic
resonance g-tensor can elegantly be calculated in terms of a derivative of the
orbital magnetization.

in spiral galaxies we present a Faraday rotation analysis of the edge-on spiral
galaxy NGC 5775. Deep radio-continuum observations in total power and linear
polarization were performed at 8.46 GHz with the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg
telescope. They were analyzed together with archival 4.86 and 1.49 GHz
VLA-data. We thus can derive rotation measures from a comparison of three
frequencies and determine the intrinsic magnetic field structure. A very
extended halo is detected in NGC 5775, with magnetic field lines forming an
X-shaped structure. Close to the galactic disk the magnetic field is
plane-parallel. The scaleheights of the radio emission esimated for NGC 5775
are comaprable with other galaxies. The rotation measure distribution varies
smoothly on both sides along the major axis from positive to negative values.
From the derived distribution of rotation measures and the plane-parallel
intrinsic magnetic field orientation along the galactic midplane we conclude
that NGC 5775 has an 'even axisymmetric' large-scale magnetic field
configuration in the disk as generated by an \alpha \Omega -dynamo which is
accompanied by a quadrupolar poloidal field. The magnetic field lines of the
plane-parallel component are pointing 'outwards'. The observed X-shaped halo
magnetic field, however, cannot be explained by the action of the disk's
mean-field dynamo alone. It is probably due to the influence of the galactic
wind together with the dynamo action.

an important way to constrain the progenitor nature of SNe Ia. Recently,
Strolger et al. (2010) obtained a very delayed DTD, which is much different
from other measurements. They suggested that metallicity could be the origin of
their delayed DTD. In this paper, we show the effect of metallicity on the DTD
of SNe Ia from single-degenerate models (including WD + MS and WD+RG channels).
Via a binary population synthesis approach, we find that the DTD from a low
metallicity population is significantly delayed compared with that from a high
metallicity one. In addition, we also find that a substantial fraction of SNe
Ia have a delay time shorter than 1 Gyr, and the fraction of SNe Ia with short
delay times increases with metallicity, i.e. about 35% for Z=0.001, while more
than 70% for Z=0.02. These results would help to qualitatively explain the
result of Strolger et al. (2010). Furthermore, we noticed that the contribution
of WD + RG channel from the low metallicity population is higher than that from
the high metallicity one. However, we can not quantitatively obtain a DTD
consistent with the results of Strolger et al. (2010) by changing metallicity.
As a consequence, metallicity may partly contribute to the DTD of SNe Ia and
should therefore be checked carefully when one derives the DTD of SNe Ia from
observations.

associated with the Raditladi and Rachmaninoff basins. These basins were
discovered during the first and third MESSENGER flybys of Mercury,
respectively. One of the most interesting features of both basins is their
relatively fresh appearance. The young age of both basins is confirmed by our
analysis on the basis of age determination via crater chronology. The derived
Rachmaninoff and Raditladi basin model ages are about 3.6 Ga and 1.1 Ga,
respectively. Moreover, we also constrain the age of the smooth plains within
the basins' floors. This analysis shows that Mercury had volcanic activity
until recent time, possibly to about 1 Ga or less. We find that some of the
crater size-frequency distributions investigated suggest the presence of a
layered target. Therefore, within this work we address the importance of
considering terrain parameters, as geo-mechanical properties and layering, into
the process of age determination. We also comment on the likelihood of the
availability of impactors able to form basins with the sizes of Rachmaninoff
and Raditladi in relatively recent times.

necessary to develop ways of reducing the search space and avoiding infinite

to speed up the search, but should not violate completeness, so that failure to

behavior. Upon lowering the energy scale, collective phenomena, bound states,
and new effective degrees of freedom emerge. Typical examples include (i)
competing magnetic, charge, and pairing instabilities in two-dimensional
electron systems, (ii) the interplay of electronic excitations and order
parameter fluctuations near thermal and quantum phase transitions in metals,
(iii) correlation effects such as Luttinger liquid behavior and the Kondo
effect showing up in linear and non-equilibrium transport through quantum wires
and quantum dots. The functional renormalization group is a flexible and
unbiased tool for dealing with such scale-dependent behavior. Its starting
point is an exact functional flow equation, which yields the gradual evolution
from a microscopic model action to the final effective action as a function of
a continuously decreasing energy scale. Expanding in powers of the fields one
obtains an exact hierarchy of flow equations for vertex functions. Truncations
of this hierarchy have led to powerful new approximation schemes. This review
is a comprehensive introduction to the functional renormalization group method
for interacting Fermi systems. We present a self-contained derivation of the
exact flow equations and describe frequently used truncation schemes. Reviewing
selected applications we then show how approximations based on the functional
renormalization group can be fruitfully used to improve our understanding of
correlated fermion systems.

Kawasaki dynamics at low temperature in a large finite box with an open
boundary. Each pair of particles occupying neighboring sites has a negative
binding energy provided their types are different, while each particle has a
positive activation energy that depends on its type. There is no binding energy
between particles of the same type. At the boundary of the box particles are
created and annihilated in a way that represents the presence of an infinite
gas reservoir. We start the dynamics from the empty box and are interested in
the transition time to the full box. This transition is triggered by a critical
droplet appearing somewhere in the box. In the first paper we identified the
parameter range for which the system is metastable, showed that the first
entrance distribution on the set of critical droplets is uniform, computed the
expected transition time up to and including a multiplicative factor of order
one, and proved that the nucleation time divided by its expectation is
exponentially distributed, all in the limit of low temperature. These results
were proved under three hypotheses, and involve three model-dependent
quantities: the energy, the shape and the number of critical droplets. In this
second paper we prove the first and the second hypothesis and identify the
energy of critical droplets. The paper deals with understanding the geometric
properties of subcritical, critical and supercritical droplets, which are
crucial in determining the metastable behavior of the system. The geometry
turns out to be considerably more complex than for Kawasaki dynamics with one
type of particle, for which an extensive literature exists. The main motivation

subway networks in an exploratory manner. We show that, remarkably, all these
networks converge to {a shape which shares similar generic features} despite
their geographic and economic differences. This limiting shape is made of a
core with branches radiating from it. For most of these networks, the average
degree of a node (station) within the core has a value of order 2.5 and the
proportion of k=2 nodes in the core is larger than 60%. The number of branches
scales roughly as the square root of the number of stations, the current
proportion of branches represents about half of the total number of stations,
and the average diameter of branches is about twice the average radial
extension of the core. Spatial measures such as the number of stations at a
given distance to the barycenter display a first regime which grows as r^2
followed by another regime with different exponents, and eventually saturates.
These results -- difficult to interpret in the framework of fractal geometry --
confirm and yield a natural explanation in the geometric picture of this core
and their branches: the first regime corresponds to a uniform core, while the
second regime is controlled by the interstation spacing on branches. The
apparent convergence towards a unique network shape in the temporal limit
suggests the existence of dominant, universal mechanisms governing the
evolution of these structures.

explore the impacts of the liquid-liquid transition on dynamics. We locate
characteristic dynamical loci in the phase diagram and compare them with the
previously investigated thermodynamic loci. The low-density liquid phase shows
a crossover from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior, signaling the onset of a

of the asymptotic approach of the low-density liquid to a random tetrahedral

amongst nature's most magnificent explosions. While GRBs launch relativistic
jets, SNe Ib/c are core-collapse explosions whose progenitors have been
stripped of their hydrogen and helium envelopes. Yet for over a decade, one of
the key outstanding questions is which conditions lead to each kind of
explosion and death in massive stars. Determining the fates of massive stars is
not only a vibrant topic in itself, but also impacts using GRBs as star
formation indicators over distances of up to 13 billion light-years and for
mapping the chemical enrichment history of the universe. This article reviews a
number of comprehensive observational studies that probe the progenitor
environments, their metallicities and the explosion geometries of SN with and
without GRBs, as well as the emerging field of SN environmental studies.
Furthermore, it discusses SN 2008D/XRT 080109 that was discovered
serendipitously with the Swift satellite via its X-ray emission from shock
breakout, and that has generated great interest amongst both observers and
theorists while illustrating a novel technique for stellar forensics. The
article concludes with an outlook on how the most promising venues of research

neutrons which, by (n,p) reactions, allow to overcome waiting point nuclei with
rather long beta-decay and proton-capture lifetimes. The synthesis of heavy
elements by the vp process depends sensitively on the \bar{\nu}_e luminosity
and spectrum. As has been shown recently, the latter are affected by collective
neutrino flavor oscillations which can swap the \bar{\nu}_e and
\bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau} spectra above a certain split energy. Assuming such a swap

interference channel (IC) where each transmitter has M antennas and each
receiver has N antennas is studied from a generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF)
perspective. An inner bound on the GDOF is derived using a combination of
techniques such as treating interference as noise, zero forcing (ZF) at the
receivers, interference alignment (IA), and extending the Han-Kobayashi (HK)
scheme to K users, as a function of the number of antennas and the log (INR) /
log (SNR) level. Three outer bounds are derived, under different assumptions of
cooperation and providing side information to receivers. The novelty in the
derivation lies in the careful selection of side information, which results in
the cancellation of the negative differential entropy terms containing signal
components, leading to a tractable outer bound. The overall outer bound is
obtained by taking the minimum of the three outer bounds. The derived bounds
are simplified for the MIMO Gaussian symmetric IC to obtain outer bounds on the
generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF). Several interesting conclusions are
drawn from the derived bounds. For example, when K > N/M + 1, a combination of
the HK and IA schemes performs the best among the schemes considered. When N/M
< K <= N/M + 1, the HK-scheme outperforms other schemes and is shown to be GDOF
optimal. In addition, when the SNR and INR are at the same level, ZF-receiving
and the HK-scheme have the same GDOF performance. It is also shown that many of
the existing results on the GDOF of the Gaussian IC can be obtained as special
cases of the bounds, e.g., by setting K=2 or the number of antennas at each
user to 1.

found that the leading contribution to mass comes from the square root of the
quantum number 'n' which coincides with Bekenstein's proposal. We also found
that the mass of the black hole is directly proportional to the quantum number
'n' when quantum gravity effects are taken into consideration via the modified
uncertainty relation but it reduces the value of mass for a particular value of
the quantum number.

wavenumber space, and the spontaneous flippings or reversals of large scale
fields. Direct numerical simulations of ideal MHD and HD are employed in three
space dimensions, at low resolution, for long periods of time, and with high
accuracy to study several cases: Different geometries, presence of rotation
and/or a uniform magnetic field, and different values of the associated
conserved global quantities. It is conjectured that the origin of all these
long-time phenomena is rooted in the interaction of the longest wavelength
fluctuations available to the system with fluctuations at much smaller scales.
The strength of this non-local interaction is controlled either by the
existence of conserved global quantities with a back-transfer in Fourier space,
or by the presence of a slow manifold in the dynamics.

can one still extract any information about the original unknown state?
Clearly, after a maximally informative measurement, the state of the system
`collapses' into a post-measurement state from which the {\em{same}} observer
cannot obtain further information about the original state of the system.
However, the system still encodes a significant amount of information about the
original preparation for a second observer who is unaware of the actions of the
first one. We study how a series of independent observers can obtain, or
scavenge, information about the unknown state of a system (quantified by the
fidelity) when they sequentially measure it. We give closed-form expressions
for the estimation fidelity, when one or several qudits are available to carry
information about the single-qudit state, and study the `classical' limit when
an arbitrarily large number of observers can obtain (nearly) complete
information on the system. In addition to the case where all observers perform
most informative measurements we study the scenario where a finite number of
observers estimate the state with equal fidelity,regardless of their position
in the measurement sequence; and the scenario where all observers use identical
measurement apparata (up to a mutually unknown orientation) chosen so that a
particular observer's estimation fidelity is maximized.

of optically thin dust. This halo or torus is located within a few AU of the
star, but its origin has not yet been understood. A dynamically excited cloud
of planetesimals colliding to eventually form dust could produce such a
structure. The cause of the dynamical excitation could be one or more planets.
This work investigates an inwardly migrating planet that is dynamically
scattering planetesimals as a possible cause for the observed structures. If
this mechanism is responsible, the observed halo-like structure could be used
to infer the existence of planets in these systems. We present analytical
estimates on the maximum inclination reached owing to dynamical interactions
between planetesimals and a migrating planet. A symplectic integrator is used
to simulate the effect of a migrating planet on a population of planetesimals.
It is found that an inwardly migrating planet is only able to scatter the
material it encounters to highly-inclined orbits if the material is on an
eccentric orbit. Such eccentric orbits can be the result of resonance trapping
and eccentricity pumping. Simulations show that for a certain range of
migration rates and planet masses, resonance capture combined with planetary
migration indeed causes the planetesimals to reach eccentric orbits and
subsequently get scattered to highly-inclined orbits. The size distribution of
the resulting dust is calculated determined to find the total mass and optical
depth, which are found to compare reasonably well with the observed structures.
Dynamical scattering of planetesimals caused by a planet migrating in, followed
by the grinding down of these planetesimals to dust grains, appears to be a
promising explanation for the inferred circumstellar dust clouds. Further study
is needed to see if the haloes can be used to infer the presence of planets.

failures (break-downs, blackouts, collapses, avalanches, ...) that can occur in
realistic networks for distribution and delivery by suppliers to consumers. A
ferromagnetic Hamiltonian with quenched random fields results from policies
that maximize the gap between demand and delivery. Such policies can arise in a
competitive market where firms artificially create new demand, or in a solidary
environment where too high a demand cannot reasonably be met. Network failure
in the context of a policy of solidarity is possible when an initially active
state becomes metastable and decays to a stable inactive state. We explore the
characteristics of the demand and delivery, as well as the topological
properties, which make the distribution network susceptible of failure. An
effective temperature is defined, which governs the strength of the activity
fluctuations which can induce a collapse. Numerical results, obtained by Monte
Carlo simulations of the model on (mainly) scale-free networks, are
supplemented with analytic mean-field approximations to the geometrical random
field fluctuations and the thermal spin fluctuations. The role of hubs versus
poorly connected nodes in initiating the breakdown of network activity is
illustrated and related to model parameters.
