overall ratio of compact to aggregate particles is 65:35 (or 13:7) for Comet
81P/Wild 2 (Burchell et al. 2008). In the present work, we propose a model
which considers cometary dust as a mixture of compact and aggregate particles,
with composition of silicate and organic. We consider compact particles as
spheroidal particles and aggregates as BCCA and BAM2 aggregate with some size
distribution. For modeling Comet 1P/ Halley, the power-law size distribution
n(a)= a^{-2.6}, for both compact and aggregate particles is taken. We take a
mixture of BAM2 and BCCA aggregates with a lower and upper cutoff size around
0.20$\mu m$ and 1$\mu m$. We also take a mixture of prolate, spherical and
oblate compact particles with axial ratio (E) from 0.8 to 1.2 where a lower and
upper cutoff size around 0.1$\mu m$ and 10$\mu m$ are taken. Using T-matrix
code, the average simulated polarization curves are generated which can best
fit the observed polarization data at the four wavelengths $\lambda$ =
0.365$\mu m$, 0.485$\mu m$, 0.670$\mu m$ and 0.684$\mu m$. The suitable mixing
percentage of aggregates emerging out from the present modeling corresponds to
50% BAM2 and 50% BCCA particles and silicate to organic mixing percentage
corresponds to 78% silicate and 22% organic in terms of volume. The present
model successfully reproduces the observed polarization data, especially the
negative branch, more effectively as compared to other work done in the past.
It is found that among the aggregates, the BAM2 aggregate plays a major role,
in deciding the cross-over angle and depth of negative polarization branch.

2"".0-3"".0 (43-65 AU) from the star and an extended outer disk whose surface
brightness declines slowly with increasing radius 3"".0-5"".1 (65-110 AU) from
the star. A precipitous drop in the surface brightness beyond 110 AU suggests
that the outer disk is truncated at that distance. The radial surface-density
profile is peaked at both the inner ring and the outer edge of the disk. The
dust in the outer disk scatters neutrally but isotropically, and it has a low
V-band albedo of 0.1. We also present new Spitzer MIPS photometry and IRS
spectra of HD 92945. These data reveal no infrared excess from the disk
shortward of 30 micron and constrain the width of the 70 micron source to < 180
AU. Assuming the dust comprises compact grains of astronomical silicate with a
surface-density profile described by our scattered-light model of the disk, we
successfully model the 24-350 micron emission with a minimum grain size of
a_min = 4.5 micron and a size distribution proportional to a^-3.7 throughout
the disk, but with a maximum grain size of 900 micron in the inner ring and 50
micron in the outer disk. Our observations indicate a total dust mass of ~0.001
M_earth. However, they provide contradictory evidence of the dust's physical
characteristics: its neutral V-I color and lack of 24 micron emission imply
grains larger than a few microns, but its isotropic scattering and low albedo
suggest a large population of submicron-sized grains. The dynamical causes of
the disk's morphology are unclear, but recent models of dust creation and
transport in the presence of migrating planets indicate an advanced state of
planet formation around HD 92945.

Lassas, Saksman and Siltanen (Inv. Prob. Imag. 2009) showed how to construct

used these prior measures to study linear inverse problems. In this paper we
build on this development of Besov priors to include the case of nonlinear

Fernique-like theorem for Besov measures. This theorem enables us to identify
appropriate conditions on the forward solution operator which, when matched to
properties of the prior Besov measure, imply the well-definedness and
well-posedness of the posterior measure. We then consider the application of
these results to the inverse problem of finding the diffusion coefficient of an

that these excesses in number counts are related to the areas where galaxies at

strongest correlation with the positions of the 1.1mm bright population (S > 5

observed excess in number counts at 1.1mm is galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-group
lensing at moderate amplification levels, that increases in amplitude as one
samples larger and larger flux densities. This effect should also be detectable
in other high redshift populations.

selected three objects (ESO 417-G006, IRAS 05218-1212, and MCG -01-05-047) from
the Swift BAT hard X-ray survey catalog with Swift X-ray Telescope XRT 0.5-10
keV spectra with flat power-law indices as candidate Compton-thick sources for
follow-up observations with the more sensitive instruments on XMM-Newton. The
XMM spectra, however, rule out reflection-dominated models based on the
weakness of the observed Fe K-alpha lines. Instead, the spectra are well-fit by
a model of a power-law continuum obscured by a Compton-thin absorber, plus a
soft excess. This result is consistent with previous follow-up observations of
two other flat-spectrum BAT-detected AGN. Thus, out of the six AGN in the
22-month BAT catalog with apparently flat Swift XRT spectra, all five that have
had follow-up observations are not likely Compton-thick. We also present new
optical spectra of two of these objects, IRAS 05218-1212 and MCG -01-05-047.
Interestingly, though both these AGN have similar X-ray spectra, their optical
spectra are completely different, adding evidence against the simplest form of
the geometric unified model of AGN. IRAS 05218-1212 appears in the optical as a
Seyfert 1, despite the ~8.5x10^22 cm^-2 line-of-sight absorbing column
indicated by its X-ray spectrum. MCG -01-05-047's optical spectrum shows no

organisms, and its consequences include phenotypic differences and genetic
disorders. CNVs are commonly detected by hybridizing genomic DNA to microarrays
of nucleic acid probes. System noise caused by operational and probe
performance variability complicates the interpretation of these data. To
minimize the distortion of genetic signal by system noise, we have explored the
latter in an archive of hybridizations in which no genetic signal is expected.
This archive is obtained by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of a sample
in one channel to the same sample in the other channel, or 'self-self' data.
These self-self hybridizations trap a variety of system noise inherent in
sample-reference (test) data. Through singular value decomposition (SVD) of
self-self data, we have determined the principal components of system noise.
Assuming simple linear models of noise generation, the linear correction of
test data with self-self data -or 'system normalization'- reduces local and
long-range correlations and improves signal-to-noise metrics, yet does not
introduce detectable spurious signal. Using this method, 90% of hybridizations
displayed improved signal-to-noise ratios with an average increase of 7.0%, due
mainly to a reduced median average deviation (MAD). In addition, we have found
that principal component loadings correlate with specific probe variables
including array coordinates, base composition, and proximity to the 5' ends of
genes. The correlation of the principal component loadings with the test data
depends on operational variables, such as the temporal order of processing and
the localization of individual samples within 96-well plates.

considering the most general Lorentz invariant Lagrangian consisting of
point-like operators for neutrinoless double beta decay. It is well known that
the Black Box operators induce Majorana neutrino masses at four-loop level.
This warrants the statement that an observation of neutrinoless double beta
decay guarantees the Majorana nature of neutrinos. We calculate these
radiatively generated masses and find that they are many orders of magnitude
smaller than the observed neutrino masses and splittings. Thus, some lepton
number violating New Physics (which may at tree-level not be related to
neutrino masses) may induce Black Box operators which can explain an observed
rate of neutrinoless double beta decay. Although these operators guarantee
finite Majorana neutrino masses, the smallness of the Black Box contributions
implies that other neutrino mass terms (Dirac or Majorana) must exist. If
neutrino masses have a significant Majorana contribution then this will become
the dominant part of the Black Box operator. However, neutrinos might also be
predominantly Dirac particles, while other lepton number violating New Physics
dominates neutrinoless double beta decay. Translating an observed rate of
neutrinoless double beta decay into neutrino masses would then be completely
misleading. Although the principal statement of the Schechter-Valle theorem
remains valid, we conclude that the Black Box diagram itself generates

Much of the data in its subfields are naturally represented as networks. This
includes trade, diplomatic and conflict relationships. The social structure of
several organization is also of interest to many researchers, such as the
affiliations of legislators or the relationships among terrorist. A key aspect
of studying social networks is understanding the evolutionary dynamics and the
mechanism by which these structures grow and change over time. While current
methods are well suited to describe static features of networks, they are less
capable of specifying models of change and simulating network evolution. In the
following paper I present a new method for modeling network growth and
evolution. This method relies on graph motifs to generate simulated network
data with particular structural characteristic. This technique departs notably
from current methods both in form and function. Rather than a closed-form
model, or stochastic implementation from a single class of graphs, the proposed
""graph motif model"" provides a framework for building flexible and complex
models of network evolution. The paper proceeds as follows: first a brief
review of the current literature on network modeling is provided to place the
graph motif model in context. Next, the graph motif model is introduced, and a
simple example is provided. As a proof of concept, three classic random graph
models are recovered using the graph motif modeling method: the Erdos-Renyi
binomial random graph, the Watts-Strogatz ""small world"" model, and the
Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model. In the final section I discuss
the results of these simulations and subsequent advantage and disadvantages
presented by using this technique to model social networks.

for price-based revenue optimization. More interestingly, mining our dataset,
we find evidence that Groupon customers are sensitive to other, ""soft"",

value of the inverse range parameter of the intermolecular potential in the
Yukawa fluid is fixed so that the ratio of the density at the critical point to
the liquid density at the triple point in this model coincides with the same
ratio in water. Subsequently, a (relatively simple) nonlinear rescaling of the

coexistence curve of real water in the temperature-density plane with good
accuracy, except close to the triple point. Such rescaling may be physically
interpreted in terms of an effective temperature-dependent attractive hard-core
Yukawa interaction potential which in turn introduces an extra temperature
dependence in the equation of state. With the addi- tion of a multiplicative
factor to obtain from the model the critical pressure of real water, the
corrected equation of state yields reasonably accurate isotherms in the liquid

breakthrough results of Dror Weitz (2006) and Allan Sly (2010) have identified
$\lambda_c(T_D)$ as a threshold where the hardness of estimating the above
partition function undergoes a computational transition.
  We focus on the well-studied particular case of the square lattice
$\integers^2$, and provide a new lower bound for the uniqueness threshold, in
particular taking it well above $\lambda_c(T_4)$. Our technique refines and
builds on the tree of self-avoiding walks approach of Weitz, resulting in a new
technical sufficient criterion (of wider applicability) for establishing strong
spatial mixing (and hence uniqueness) for the hard-core model. Our new
criterion achieves better bounds on strong spatial mixing when the graph has
extra structure, improving upon what can be achieved by just using the maximum
degree. Applying our technique to $\integers^2$ we prove that strong spatial
mixing holds for all $\lambda<2.3882$, improving upon the work of Weitz that
held for $\lambda<27/16=1.6875$. Our results imply a fully-polynomial
deterministic approximation algorithm for estimating the partition function, as
well as rapid mixing of the associated Glauber dynamics to sample from the

step from centimetre sized pre-planetesimals to kilometre sized planetesimals

pre-planetesimals may be halted by a combination of fragmentation in disruptive
collisions and mutual rebound with compaction. However, the right amount of
fragmentation is necessary to explain the observed dust features in late T
Tauri discs. Therefore, detailed data on the outcome of pre-planetesimal
collisions is required and has to be presented in a suitable and precise
format. We propose and apply a new classification scheme for pre-planetesimal
collisions based on the quantitative aspects of four fragment populations: the
largest and second largest fragment, a power-law population, and a
sub-resolution population. For the simulations of pre-planetesimal collisions,
we adopt the SPH numerical scheme with extensions for the simulation of porous
solid bodies. By means of laboratory benchmark experiments, this model was
previously calibrated and tested for the correct simulation of the compaction,
bouncing, and fragmentation behaviour of macroscopic highly porous silica dust
aggregates. It is shown that previous attempts to map collision data were much
too oriented on qualitatively categorising into sticking, bouncing, and
fragmentation events. We show that the four-populations model encompasses all
previous categorisations and in addition allows for transitions. This is
because it is based on quantitative characteristic attributes of each
population such as the mass, kinetic energy, and filling factor. As a
demonstration of the applicability and the power of the four-populations model,
we utilise it to present the results of a study on the influence of collision
velocity in head-on collisions of intermediate porosity aggregates.

faster and better sampled optical follow-up, which has unveiled a very complex
behaviour. This complexity is triggering the interest of the whole GRB
community. The GROND multi-channel imager is used to study optical and
near-infrared (NIR) afterglows of GRBs with unprecedented optical and
near-infrared temporal and spectral resolution. The GRB 081029 has a very
prominent optical rebrightening event and is an outstanding example of the
application of the multi-channel imager to GRB afterglows. Aims. Here we
exploit the rich GROND multi-colour follow-up of GRB 081029 combined with XRT
observations to study the nature of late-time rebrightenings that appear in the
optical-NIR light-curves of some GRB afterglows. Methods. We analyse the
optical and NIR observations obtained with the seven-channel Gamma-Ray burst
Optical and Near-infrared Detector (GROND) at the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope and
the X-ray data obtained with the XRT telescope on board the Swift observatory.
The multi-wavelength temporal and spectral evolution is discussed in the
framework of different physical models. Results. The extremely steep optical
and NIR rebrightening observed in GRB 081029 cannot be explained in the
framework of the standard forward shock afterglow model. The absence of a
contemporaneous X-ray rebrightening and the evidence of a strong spectral
evolution in the optical-NIR bands during the rise suggest two separate
components that dominate in the early and late-time lightcurves, respectively.
The steepness of the optical rise cannot be explained even in the framework of
the alternative scenarios proposed in the literature unless a late-time
activity of the central engine is assumed.

star WR 110 (HD 165688) reveals a fundamental periodicity of P = 4.08 +/- 0.55
days along with a number of harmonics at periods P/n, with n ~ 2,3,4,5 and 6,
and a few other possible stray periodicities and/or stochastic variability on
timescales longer than about a day. Spectroscopic RV studies fail to reveal any
plausible companion with a period in this range. Therefore, we conjecture that
the observed light-curve cusps of amplitude ~ 0.01 mag that recur at a 4.08 day
timescale may arise in the inner parts, or at the base of, a corotating
interaction region (CIR) seen in emission as it rotates around with the star at
constant angular velocity. The hard X-ray component seen in WR 110 could then
be a result of a high velocity component of the CIR shock interacting with the
ambient wind at several stellar radii. Given that most hot, luminous stars
showing CIRs have two CIR arms, it is possible that either the fundamental
period is 8.2 days or, more likely in the case of WR 110, there is indeed a
second weaker CIR arm for P = 4.08 days, that occurs ~ two thirds of a rotation
period after the main CIR. If this interpretation is correct, WR 110 therefore
joins the ranks with three other single WR stars, all WN, with confirmed CIR
rotation periods (WR 1, WR 6, and WR 134), albeit with WR 110 having by far the
lowest amplitude photometric modulation. This illustrates the power of being
able to secure intense, continuous high-precision photometry from space-based
platforms such as MOST. It also opens the door to revealing low-amplitude
photometric variations in other WN stars, where previous attempts have failed.
If all WN stars have CIRs at some level, this could be important for revealing
sources of magnetism or pulsation in addition to rotation periods.

presented. A program in Mathematica based on the structure of FeynCalc which
automatically simplifies a set of amplitudes up to the hexagon level of rank 5
has been created for this purpose. We focus on two different topologies. The
first involves all the virtual contributions needed for quadruple electroweak
vector boson production, i.e. pp -> VVVV + X. In the second, the remaining
""bosonic"" corrections to electroweak triple vector boson production with an
additional jet (pp -> VVV j + X) are computed. We show the factorization
formula of the infrared divergences of the bosonic contributions for VVVV and
VVVj production with V=(W,Z,gamma). Stability issues associated with the
evaluation of the hexagons up to rank 5 are studied. The CPU time of the
FORTRAN subroutines rounds the 2 milliseconds and seems to be competitive with
other more sophisticated methods. Additionally, in Appendix A the master
equations to obtain the tensor coefficients up to the hexagon level in the
external momenta convention are presented including the ones needed for small

prediction that the first, chemically pristine (population III) stars formed
with very high characteristic masses. Since isolated population III stars are
likely to be beyond the reach of JWST, small population III galaxies may offer
the best prospects of directly probing the properties of metal-free stars.
Here, we present Yggdrasil, a new spectral synthesis code geared towards the
first galaxies. Using this model, we explore the JWST imaging detection limits
for population III galaxies and investigate to what extent such objects may be
identified based on their JWST colours. We predict that JWST should be able to
detect population III galaxies with stellar population masses as low as ~10^5
Msolar at z=10 in ultra deep exposures. Over limited redshift intervals, it may
also be possible to use colour criteria to select population III galaxy
candidates for follow-up spectroscopy. The colours of young population III
galaxies dominated by direct star light can be used to probe the stellar
initial mass function (IMF), but this requires almost complete leakage of
ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. The colours of objects
dominated by nebular emission show no corresponding IMF sensitivity. We also
note that a clean selection of population III galaxies at z~7-8 can be achieved
by adding two JWST/MIRI filters to the JWST/NIRCam filter sets usually
discussed in the context of JWST ultra deep fields.

variety of high-energy processes. Observations in the X-ray and centimetric
radio wavelength ranges are thought to constrain some of these processes, e.g.,
coronal-type magnetic activity. There is a well-known empirical correlation of
radio and X-ray luminosities in active stars, the so-called Guedel-Benz
relation. Previous evidence whether YSOs are compatible with this relation
remains inconclusive for the earliest evolutionary stages. The main difficulty
is that due to the extreme variability of these sources, simultaneous
observations are essential. Until now, only few YSOs and only a handful of
protostars have been observed simultaneously in the X-ray and radio range. To
expand the sample, we have obtained such observations of two young clusters
rich in protostars, NGC 1333 and IC 348. While the absolute sensitivity is
lower for these regions than for more nearby clusters like CrA, we find that
even in deep continuum observations carried out with the NRAO Very Large Array,
the radio detection fraction for protostars in these clusters is much lower
than the X-ray detection fraction. Very few YSOs are detected in both bands,
and we find the radio and X-ray populations among YSOs to be largely distinct.
We combine these new results with previous simultaneous Chandra and VLA
observations of star-forming regions and find that YSOs with detections in both
bands appear to be offset toward higher radio luminosities for given X-ray
luminosities when compared to the Guedel-Benz relation, although even in this
sensitive dataset most sources are too weak for the radio detections to provide
information on the emission processes. The considerably improved sensitivity of
the Expanded Very Large Array will provide a better census of the YSO radio
population as well as better constraints on the emission mechanisms.

suggest that these observations can be reproduced with a single structure. In
this simulation a stellar bar evolved from the disk, and the boxy bulge
originated from it through secular evolution and the buckling instability. We
calculate starcount distributions for this model at different longitudes and
latitudes, in a similar way as observers have done for resolved starcounts.
Good agreement between the simulation and the observations can be achieved for
a suitable snapshot, even though the simulation has a single boxy bulge and
bar} structure. In this model, part of the long bar signature is due to a
volume effect in the starcounts, and another part is due to chosing a snapshot
in which the planar part of the boxy bulge and bar has developed leading ends
through interaction with the adjacent spiral arm heads. We also provide
predictions from this model for the line-of-sight velocity distributions at the
longitudes with the long bar signature, for comparison with upcoming surveys.

distortion and variation in surface temperature from the pole to the equator.
Radiatively driven mass loss is temperature dependent, so rapid rotation
produces variation in mass loss and angular momentum loss rates across the
surface of the star, which is expected to affect the evolution of rapidly
rotating massive stars. In this work, we investigate the two dimensional
effects of rotation on radiatively driven mass loss and the associated loss of
angular momentum in ZAMS models with solar metallicity. Using 2D stellar
models, which give the variation in surface parameters as a function of
co-latitude, we implement two different mass loss prescriptions describing
radiatively driven mass loss. We find a significant variation in mass loss
rates and angular momentum loss as a function of co-latitude. We find that the
mass loss rate decreases as the rotation rate increases for models at constant
initial mass, and derive scaling relations based on these models. When
comparing 2D to 1D mass loss rates, we find that although the total angle
integrated mass loss does not differ significantly, the 2D models predict less
mass loss from the equator and more mass loss from the pole than the 1D
predictions using von Zeipel's law. As a result, rotating models lose less
angular momentum in 2D than in 1D, which will change the subsequent evolution
of the star. The evolution of these models will be investigated in future work.

and the scales involved for an SU(2) gauge group, using traditional QCD
instanton methods. We represent the vacuum functional as the partition function
of a bion-anti-bion plasma and obtain the next-to-leading dependence of the
mass gap on the S**1 size L at fixed strong-coupling scale Lambda. We find
that, at small Lambda x L, the mass gap is an increasing function of L for
theories with four massless adjoint Weyl fermions, a case left undetermined by
the previous leading-order analysis, and comment on the approach to R**4.

presumed to be synchrotron emission by PeV (10^{15} eV) electrons in milligauss
magnetic fields, presents a strong challenge to particle acceleration models.
The observed photon energies exceed the upper limit (~100 MeV) obtained by
balancing the acceleration rate and synchrotron radiation losses under standard
conditions where the electric field is smaller than the magnetic field. We
argue that a linear electric accelerator, operating at magnetic reconnection
sites, is able to circumvent this difficulty. Sufficiently energetic electrons
have gyroradii so large that their motion is insensitive to small-scale
turbulent structures in the reconnection layer and is controlled only by
large-scale fields. We show that such particles are guided into the
reconnection layer by the reversing magnetic field as they are accelerated by
the reconnection electric field. As these electrons become confined within the
current sheet, they experience a decreasing perpendicular magnetic field that
may drop below the accelerating electric field. This enables them to reach
higher energies before suffering radiation losses and hence to emit synchrotron
radiation in excess of the 100 MeV limit, providing a natural resolution to the
Crab gamma-ray flare paradox.

other, that recently brightened by around 5 mags and were reported as possible
new FU Orionis-type variables.
  The outburst spectrum of V2492 Cyg shows atomic emission features throughout
the optical and near-infrared. In the optical, Halpha is in emission and has an
associated blue-shifted absorption component. The far-red CaII triplet lines
are also in emission and, as with Halpha, possess significant blue-shifted
absorption. The optical TiO molecular bands are also in emission. In the
near-infrared, Pabeta, Brgamma, and the CO overtone bandheads are strongly in
emission. Such spectral characteristics are very similar to those exhibited by
both EX Lupi, the progenitor of the EXor class of eruptive variables, during
its 2008 extreme outburst, and V1647 Ori during its elevated phase in 2003.
  Additionally, we consider archival data on V2492 Cyg and investigate the
pre-outburst nature of this young star. We construct a quiescent-phase spectral
energy distribution which, via model fitting, gives insight into the
circumstellar environment of the object prior to the current eruption.
  Our investigation strongly suggests that the V2492 Cyg outburst appears to be
more consistent with an EXor event, a fact supported by its recent 2 mag fading

photometric range of delta~0.7 mag. In 2005, the nucleus exhibits a
significantly smaller photometric range that is attributed to viewing geometry
effects. An analysis of these effects showed that 176P likely has an axis ratio
of 1.8<b/a<2.1, an obliquity of epsilon~60 deg, and a solstice position at a
true anomaly of ~20 deg. Numerical modeling found that 176P's activity can only
be reproduced by asymmetric dust emission, such as a cometary jet. We find
plausible fits to our observations using models assuming ~10 micron dust
particles continuously emitted over 176P's active period, and a jet direction
of 180 < alpha_jet < 120 deg and delta_jet ~ -60 deg. We do not find good fits
to our observations using models of impulsive dust emission, i.e., what would
be expected from an impact. Since for a rotating body, the time-averaged
direction of a non-equatorial jet is equivalent to the direction of the nearest
rotation pole, we find an equivalent orbital obliquity of 50 < epsilon < 75
deg, consistent with the results of our lightcurve analysis. The results of our
lightcurve analysis and dust modeling analysis are furthermore both consistent
with the seasonal heating hypothesis used to explain the modulation of 176P's
activity. Additional observations are highly encouraged to further characterize
176P's active behavior as the object approaches perihelion on 2011 July 01.

polarization, but not energy, as all energy is stored locally. The local
evolution of the part of the system where energy is stored drives the rest of
the system through long-range entanglement. We also examine approximations for
the ground state of this Hamiltonian in the strong field limit, and study how

turns out useful.
  The strength of modern cosmology lies in consistency across independent,
often unrelated pieces of evidence. Therefore, every alternative method of
restricting cosmic equation of state is important. Strongly gravitationally
lensed quasar-galaxy systems create such new opportunity by combining stellar
kinematics (central velocity dispersion measurements) with lensing geometry
(Einstein radius determination form position of images).
  In this paper we apply such method to a combined data sets from SLACS and LSD
surveys of gravitational lenses. In result we obtain the cosmic equation of
state parameters, which generally agree with results already known in the
literature. This demonstrates that the method can be further used on larger
samples obtained in the future. Independently noticed systematic deviation
between fits done on standard candles and standard rulers is revealed in our
findings. We also identify an important selection effect crucial to our method
associated with geometric configuration of the lensing system along line of

event, representing a helioseismic response to the flare impact in the solar
photosphere, which was observed with the HMI instrument on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). The impulsively excited acoustic waves formed a compact
wavepacket traveling through the solar interior and appearing on the surface as
expanding wave ripples. The initial flare impacts were observed in the form of
compact and rapid variations of the Doppler velocity, line-of-sight magnetic
field and continuum intensity. These variations formed a typical two-ribbon
flare structure, and are believed to be associated with thermal and
hydrodynamic effects of high-energy particles heating the lower atmosphere. The
analysis of the SDO/HMI and X-ray data from the Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) shows that the helioseismic waves were initiated
by the photospheric impact in the early impulsive phase, observed prior to the
hard X-ray (50-100 keV) impulse, and were probably associated with atmospheric
heating by relatively low-energy electrons (~6-50 keV) and heat flux transport.
The impact caused a short motion in the sunspot penumbra prior to the
appearance of the helioseismic wave. It is found that the helioseismic wave
front traveling through a sunspot had a lower amplitude and was significantly
delayed relative to the front traveling outside the spot. These observations
open new perspectives for studying the flare photospheric impacts and for using
the flare-excited waves for sunspot seismology.

electrical conductivity reduce to those of Capdeboscq and Vogelius when the
volume fraction is asymptotically small. Other volume fraction bounds derived

the body in a water filled cylinder with a piston at one end and measuring the

developed for JDEM. We further compare these four alternative WFIRST
configurations to JDEM-Omega and to the European Space Agency's Euclid mission,
and to an alternative Euclid configuration making use of the lessons learned
here that delivers performance approaching that of WFIRST. We find that the
unobstructed pupil is a major benefit to weak lensing owing to its tighter
point spread function, improved signal to noise, and higher resolved galaxy
count. Using two simultaneous plate scales in a fully focal system is practical
and simplifies the optical train, and the use of a prism in converging light
offers improved throughput compared to a grism. We find that a 45 degree outer
baffle cutoff angle, combined with fully articulated solar panels and K-band
antenna, substantially increase the exoplanet yield. Presented at the 217th AAS

outcomes of an observation must be equally likely. The condition of equally
likely outcomes may be enforced in quantum theory by ensuring that one's state
$\rho$ is maximally different, or complementary, to the measured observable.
This requires the ability to perform unitary operations on the state,
conditioned on the results of prior measurements. We consider the case of
measurement of a component of angular momentum for a qudit (a $D$-dimensional
system, with $D=2J+1$). For weak or continuous-in-time (i.e. repeated weak)
measurements, we show that the complementarity condition ensures an average
improvement, in the rate of purification, of only 2. However, we show that by
choosing the optimal control protocol of this type, one can attain the best
possible scaling, $O(D^{2})$, for the average improvement. For this protocol
the acquisition of information is nearly deterministic. Finally we contrast
these results with those for complementarity-based protocols in a register of
qbits.

of AGN number counts in three hard X-ray bandpasses: 6-10 keV, 10-30 keV and
30-60 keV. Separate predictions are presented for the number counts of Compton
thick AGNs, the most heavily obscured active galaxies. The number counts are
calculated for five different models of the XRB that differ in the assumed hard
X-ray luminosity function, the evolution of the Compton thick AGNs, and the
underlying AGN spectral model. The majority of the hard X-ray number counts
will be Compton thin AGNs, but there is a >10x increase in the Compton thick
number counts from the 6-10 keV to the 10-30 keV band. The Compton thick
population show enough variation that a hard X-ray number counts measurement
will constrain the models. The computed number counts are used to consider
various survey strategies for the NuSTAR mission, assuming a total exposure
time of 6.2 Ms. We find that multiple surveys will allow a measurement of

Polar warmth in these interglacials and in the Pliocene does not imply that a
substantial cushion remains between today's climate and dangerous warming, but
rather that Earth is poised to experience strong amplifying polar feedbacks in
response to moderate global warming. Thus goals to limit human-made warming to
2{\deg}C are not sufficient - they are prescriptions for disaster. Ice sheet
disintegration is nonlinear, spurred by amplifying feedbacks. We suggest that
ice sheet mass loss, if warming continues unabated, will be characterized
better by a doubling time for mass loss rate than by a linear trend. Satellite
gravity data, though too brief to be conclusive, are consistent with a doubling
time of 10 years or less, implying the possibility of multi-meter sea level
rise this century. Observed accelerating ice sheet mass loss supports our
conclusion that Earth's temperature now exceeds the mean Holocene value. Rapid
reduction of fossil fuel emissions is required for humanity to succeed in
preserving a planet resembling the one on which civilization developed.

The results of the calculations show that for the sticking probability of
alpha_j=1, C, silicate, Si, and FeS grains can condense at early times of
~100--300 days after the explosion, whereas Fe and SiC grains cannot form
substantially. Due to the low gas density in SNe Ia with no H-envelope, the
average radii of the newly formed grains are generally below 0.01 micron, being
much smaller than those in Type II-P SNe. This supports our previous conclusion
that the radius of dust formed in the ejecta is smaller in SNe with less
massive envelopes. The total dust mass ranges from 3x10^{-4} M_sun to 0.2 M_sun
for alpha_j=0.1--1, depending on whether or not CO and SiO molecules are
formed. We also estimate the optical depths and thermal emission by the newly
formed dust and compare to the relevant observations of SNe Ia. We find that
the formation of C grains in SNe Ia is suppressed to be consistent with the
observational constraints. This implies that energetic photons and electrons
heavily depress the formation efficiency of C grains or that the outermost C-O
layer of SNe Ia is almost fully burned. Finally, we perform the calculations of
dust destruction in the SN remnants and find that dust grains formed in the
ejecta of SNe Ia are almost completely destroyed in the shocked gas before
being injected into the interstellar medium. This indicates that SNe Ia are
unlikely to be the major sources of interstellar dust.

magnitudes with a spherical NEATM model, we compute the predicted fluxes after

errors of 5-10%, yielding minimum relative diameter and albedo errors of ~10%

compared to the albedos at 3.4 and 4.6 microns, which contain a mix of
reflected sunlight and thermal emission for most asteroids. We derive a linear
relationship between subsolar temperature and effective temperature, which
allows the color corrections given in Wright et al. (2010) to be used for

wavelength region for searching for exoplanets around M dwarfs in the coming
decade. It is based on calculating the Q factor, a measure of flux-normalized
Doppler sensitivity in the fringing spectra created with DFDI. We calculate the
Q factor as a function of spectral resolution R, stellar projected rotational
velocity V sini, stellar effective temperature T_eff and optical path
difference (OPD) of the interferometer. We also compare the DFDI Q factor to
that for the popular cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph method (the direct
echelle (DE) method). Given the IR Doppler measurement is likely to be
detector-limited for a while, we introduce new merit functions, which is
directly related to photon-limited RV uncertainty, to evaluate Doppler
performance with the DFDI and DE methods. We find that DFDI has strength in
wavelength coverage and multi-object capability over the DE for a limited
detector resource. We simulate the performance of the InfraRed Exoplanet
Tracker (IRET) based on the DFDI design, being considered for the next
generation IR Doppler measurements. The predicted photon-limited RV uncertainty
suggests that IRET is capable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in habitable
zone around nearby bright M dwarfs if they exist. A new method is developed to
quantitatively estimate the influence of telluric lines on RV uncertainty. Our
study shows that photon-limited RV uncertainty can be reached if 99% of the
strength of telluric lines can be removed from the measured stellar spectra. At
low to moderate levels of telluric line strength removal (50% to 90%), the
optimal RV uncertainty is typically a factor of 2-3 times larger than
photon-limited RV uncertainty.

dynamic instability of microtubules (MTs) in cells. The MTs switches between
two states, assembly state and disassembly state. In assembly state, the growth
of MTs includes two processes: free GTP-tubulin binding to the tip of
protofilament (PF) and conformation change of PF, during which the first
tubulin unit which curls outwards is rearranged into MT surface using the
energy released from the hydrolysis of GTP in the penultimate tubulin unit. In

release of GDP-tibulin from the tip of PF and one new tubulin unit curls out of
the MT surface. Switches between these two states, which are usually called
rescue and catastrophe, happen stochastically with external force dependent
rates. Using this two-state model with parameters obtained by fitting the
recent experimental data, detailed properties of MT growth are obtained, we
find that MT is mainly in assembly state, its mean growth velocity increases
with external force and GTP-tubulin concentration, MT will shorten in average
without external force. To know more about the external force and GTP-tubulin

constrained with the new Herschel and MIR Spitzer data. A submillimetre excess
is often found in low metallicity galaxies, which,if tracing very cold dust,
would highlight large dust masses not easily reconciled in some cases, given
the low metallicities and expected gas-to-dust mass ratios. The galaxies are
also mapped in the FIR fine-structure lines (63 and 145mu OI, 158mu CII, 122
and 205mu NII, 88mu OIII) probing the low density ionised gas, the HII regions
and photodissociation regions. While still early in the Herschel mission we can
already see, along with earlier studies, that line ratios in the metal-poor ISM
differ remarkably from those in the metal-rich starburst environments. In dwarf
galaxies, L[CII]/L(CO) (>10^4) is at least an order of magnitude greater than
in the most metal-rich starburst galaxies. The enhanced [CII] arises from the
larger photodissociation region where H2, not traced by the CO, can exist. The
88mu [OIII] line usually dominates the FIR line emission over galaxy-wide
scales in dwarf galaxies, not the 158mu [CII] line which is the dominant FIR
cooling line in metal-rich galaxies. All of the FIR lines together can
contribute 1% to 2% of the L(TIR). The Herschel Dwarf Galaxy survey will
provide statistical information on the nature of the dust and gas in low
metallicity galaxies, elucidating the origin of the submm excess in dwarf
galaxies, and help determine a ([CII] +CO) to H2 conversion factor, thus
providing observational constraints on chemical evolution models of galaxies.

the pendular regime, based upon numerical experiments using the discrete
element method, compared to a microstructural elastoplastic model. Water
effects are taken into account by adding capillary menisci at contacts and
their consequences in terms of force and water volume are studied. Simulations
of triaxial compression tests are used to investigate both macro and
micro-effects of a partial saturation. The results provided by the two methods
appear to be in good agreement, reproducing the major trends of a partially
saturated granular assembly, such as the increase in the shear strength and the
hardening with suction. Moreover, a capillary stress tensor is exhibited from
capillary forces by using homogenisation techniques. Both macroscopic and
microscopic considerations emphasize an induced anisotropy of the capillary
stress tensor in relation with the pore fluid distribution inside the material.
In so far as the tensorial nature of this fluid fabric implies shear effects on
the solid phase associated with suction, a comparison has been made with the
standard equivalent pore pressure assumption. It is shown that water effects
induce microstrural phenomena that cannot be considered at the macro level,
particularly when dealing with material history. Thus, the study points out
that unsaturated soil stress definitions should include, besides the
macroscopic stresses such as the total stress, the microscopic interparticle
stresses such as the ones resulting from capillary forces, in order to
interpret more precisely the implications of the pore fluid on the mechanical
behaviour of granular materials.

between the Andreev states leading to a large suppression of the supercurrent

follow a simple Bessel-function-like behavior, and (iii) at finite temperature,
the microwave field can enhance the critical current by means of transitions
connecting the continuum of states outside the gap region and the Andreev

discoverability of the points employing a typical ATLAS-type search based on
missing transverse momentum (MET), a search based on an optimised MT2 cut and a
combination of the two, taking into account standard model backgrounds. The
discovery reach of the strategies can depend strongly on the systematic
uncertainty in the background, subject to the stringency of the cuts and the
details of the background simulation. By combining the MET and MT2 based
strategies, with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb^-1 (10 fb^-1) at 7 TeV, 4-8%
(42%) of the points are discoverable, depending on the systematic uncertainty
on the background. At 14 TeV and with 10 fb^-1, 96% of the points are
discoverable. While the majority of points can be discovered by both strategies
at sqrt{s} = 14 TeV and with 1 fb^-1, there are some that are left undiscovered
by a MET search strategy, but which are discovered by the MT2 strategy, and
vice versa, therefore it is essential that one performs both in parallel. We
discuss some of the factors that can make points more difficult to observe.

fluid pressure is taken into account even in the homogeneous and isotropic

approximation and compared to the one predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. The
difference between the CCDM and $\Lambda$CDM predictions at the perturbative
level is quantified by using three different statistical methods, namely: a
simple $\chi^{2}$-analysis in the relevant space parameter, a Bayesian
statistical inference, and, finally, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We find that
under certain circumstances the CCDM scenario analysed here predicts an overall
dynamics (including Hubble flow and matter fluctuation field) which fully
recovers that of the traditional cosmic concordance model. Our basic conclusion
is that such a reduction of the dark sector provides a viable alternative
description to the accelerating $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

branches propagating polewards rather than equatorwards (the solar case).
Stellar dynamo theory allows polewards propagating dynamo waves for certain
governing parameters. We try to unite observations and theory, restricting our
investigation to the simplest mean-field dynamo models. We suggest a crude
preliminary systematization of the reported cases of polar activity branches.
Then we present results of dynamo model simulations which contain magnetic
structures with polar dynamo waves, and identify the models which look most
promising for explaining the latitudinal distribution of spots in dwarf stars.
Those models require specific features of stellar rotation laws, and so
observations of polar activity branches may constrain internal stellar
rotation. Specifically, we find it unlikely that a pronounced poleward branch
can be associated with a solar-like internal rotation profile, while it can be
more readily reproduced in the case of a cylindrical rotation law appropriate
for fast rotators. We stress the case of the subgiant component of the active
close binary HR 1099 which, being best investigated, presents the most severe
problems for a dynamo interpretation. Our best model requires dynamo action in
two layers separated in radius. Observations of polar activity branches provide
valuable information for understanding stellar activity mechanisms and internal
rotation, and thus deserve intensive observational and theoretical
investigation. Current stellar dynamo theory seems sufficiently robust to
accommodate the phenomenology.

long spin periods (10 - 200 ms) and massive ($\ga 0.4 M_{\odot}$) white dwarf
(WD) companions. Recently, precise mass measurements have been performed for
the pulsar and the WD in the IMBP PSR J1802-2124. Some observed properties,
such as the low mass of the pulsar, the high mass of the WD, the moderately
long spin period, and the tight orbit, imply that this system has undergone a
peculiar formation mechanism. In this work, we attempt to simulate the detailed
evolutionary history of PSR J1802-2124. We propose that a binary system
consisting of a neutron star (NS, of mass $1.3 M_{\odot}$) and an He star (of
mass $1.0 M_{\odot}$), and with an initial orbital period of 0.5 d, may have
been the progenitor of PSR J1802-2124. Once the He star overflows its Roche
lobe, He-rich material is transferred onto the NS at a relatively high rate of
$\sim 10^{-7}-10^{-6} M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$, which is significantly higher
than the Eddington accretion rate. A large amount of the transferred material
is ejected from the vicinity of the NS by radiation pressure and results in the
birth of a mildly recycled pulsar. Our simulated results are consistent with
the observed parameters of PSR J1802-2124. Therefore, we argue that the NS + He
star evolutionary channel may be responsible for the formation of most IMBPs
with orbital periods $\la 3 \rm d$.

the significant limitations of this approach is that each bore has a specific
cutoff frequency, which can be higher than most Larmor frequencies of at the
magnetic field strengths commonly in use for MR imaging and spectroscopy today.
We overcome this limitation by using a central conductor in the waveguide and
thereby converting it to a transmission line (TL), which has no cutoff
frequency. Broadband propagation of waves through the sample thus becomes
possible. NMR spectra and images with such an arrangement are presented and
genuine traveling wave behavior is demonstrated. In addition to facilitating
NMR spectroscopy and imaging in smaller bores via traveling waves, this
approach also allows one to perform multinuclear traveling wave experiments (an
example of which is shown), and to study otherwise difficult-to-access samples

deliver higher cut-off frequencies than traditional semiconductors such as Si

observed to be higher than that in GFETs. The optimum device biasing conditions
for AFETs require smaller biasing currents, and thus, lower power dissipation
compared to GFETs. The degradation in high-frequency performance in the

We assume that $p\geq

paths by time $t$, i.e., the random measure on $\R^d$ that assigns to any
measurable set $A\subset \R^d$ the amount of intersection local time of the
motions spent in $A$ by time $t$. Earlier results of Chen \cite{Ch09} derived
the logarithmic asymptotics of the upper tails of the total mass $\ell_t(\R^d)$
as $t\to\infty$. In this paper, we derive a large-deviation principle for the
normalised intersection measure $t^{-p}\ell_t$ on the set of positive measures
on some open bounded set $B\subset\R^d$ as $t\to\infty$ before exiting $B$. The
rate function is explicit and gives some rigorous meaning, in this asymptotic
regime, to the understanding that the intersection measure is the pointwise
product of the densities of the normalised occupation times measures of the $p$
motions. Our proof makes the classical Donsker-Varadhan principle for the
latter applicable to the intersection measure.
  A second version of our principle is proved for the motions observed until
the individual exit times from $B$, conditional on a large total mass in some
compact set $U\subset B$. This extends earlier studies on the intersection
measure by K\""onig and M\""orters \cite{KM01,KM05}.

quantify the effect of baryon physics on the weak gravitational lensing shear
signal. The simulations consider a number of processes, such as radiative
cooling, star formation, supernovae and feedback from active galactic nuclei
(AGN). Van Daalen et al. (2011) used the same simulations to show that baryon
physics, in particular the strong feedback that is required to solve the
overcooling problem, modifies the matter power spectrum on scales relevant for
cosmological weak lensing studies. As a result, the use of power spectra from
dark matter simulations can lead to significant biases in the inferred
cosmological parameters. We show that the typical biases are much larger than
the precision with which future missions aim to constrain the dark energy
equation of state, w_0. For instance, the simulation with AGN feedback, which
reproduces X-ray and optical properties of groups of galaxies, gives rise to a
~40% bias in w_0. We demonstrate that the modification of the power spectrum is
dominated by groups and clusters of galaxies, the effect of which can be
modelled. We consider an approach based on the popular halo model and show that
simple modifications can capture the main features of baryonic feedback.
Despite its simplicity, we find that our model, when calibrated on the
simulations, is able to reduce the bias in w_0 to a level comparable to the
size of the statistical uncertainties for a Euclid-like mission. While
observations of the gas and stellar fractions as a function of halo mass can be
used to calibrate the model, hydrodynamic simulations will likely still be
needed to extend the observed scaling relations down to halo masses of 10 ^12

the Kepler satellite. The analysis has allowed us to determine the large and
small frequency separations, and the frequency of maximum oscillation power.
The high signal-to-noise ratio of the observations allowed us to identify 25
independent pulsation modes whose frequencies range approximately from 300 to
500 muHz. The observed oscillation frequencies together with the accurate
determination of the atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, gravity and
metallicity), provided by additional ground-based spectroscopic observations,
enabled us to theoretically interpret the observed oscillation spectrum. KIC
4351319 appears to oscillate with a well defined solar-type p-modes pattern due
to radial acoustic modes and non-radial nearly pure p modes. In addition,
several non-radial mixed modes have been identified. Theoretical models well
reproduce the observed oscillation frequencies and indicate that this star,

operators which is useful in describing the paramagnetic phase and transitions
to magnetically ordered phases in magnetic systems with large single-ion
easy-plane anisotropy $D$. Considering the exchange interaction between spins
as a perturbation and using the diagram technique we derive the elementary
excitation spectrum and the ground state energy in the third order of the
perturbation theory. In the special case of S=1 we obtain these expressions
also using simpler spin representations some of which were introduced before.
Comparison with results of previous numerical studies of 2D systems with S=1
demonstrates that our approach works better than other analytical methods
applied before for such systems. We apply our results for the elementary
excitation spectrum analysis obtained experimentally in $\rm NiCl_2$-$\rm
4SC(NH_2)_2$ (DTN). It is demonstrated that a set of model parameters (exchange
constants and $D$) which has been used for DTN so far describes badly the
experimentally obtained spectrum. A new set of parameters is proposed using
which we fit the spectrum and values of two critical fields of DTN.

variables in the local observable universe, which is limited to a portion of
the whole universe. To provide a theoretical prediction of the observable
fluctuations, we need to preserve the gauge-invariance in the local universe,
which is referred to the genuine gauge-invariance. The importance of the
genuine gauge-invariance is highlighted in the study of primordial fluctuations
in the infrared (IR) limit. The stability against IR loop corrections to
primordial fluctuations is guaranteed in requesting the genuine
gauge-invariance. The genuine gauge-invariance also gives the impact on the
detectable fluctuations. We showed that at observable scales the bi-spectrum
calculated in the conventional perturbation theory vanishes in the squeezed
limit, if we request the genuine gauge invariance. This indicates that the
conventional bi-spectrum is, in this limit, dominated by a gauge artifact,
which cannot be observed. These studies have been elaborated in single-field
models of inflation. In this paper we generalize our argument to multi-field
models of inflation, where, in addition to the adiabatic field, the entropy
field can participate in the generation of primordial fluctuations. We will
find that the entropy field can generate the observable fluctuations, which
cannot be eliminated by gauge transformations in the local universe.

photodissociation of D2O in an amorphous D2O ice surface at 10-90 K, in order
to investigate the influence of isotope effects on the photodesorption
processes. As for H2O, the main processes after UV photodissociation are
trapping and desorption. There are three desorption processes: D atom, OD
radical, and D2O molecule photodesorption. D2O desorption takes places either
by direct desorption of a recombined D2O molecule, or when an energetic D atom
produced by photodissociation kicks a surrounding D2O molecule out of the
surface by transferring part of its momentum. Desorption probabilities are
compared quantitatively with those for H2O obtained from previous MD
simulations of UV photodissociation of amorphous water ice. The main
conclusions are the same, but the average D atom photodesorption probability is
smaller than that of the H atom (by about a factor of 0.9) because D has lower
kinetic energy than H, whereas the average OD radical photodesorption
probability is larger than that of OH (by about a factor of 2.5-2.9 depending
on Tice) because OD has higher translational energy than OH for every Tice
studied. The average D2O photodesorption probability is larger than that of H2O
(by about a factor of 1.4-2.3 depending on Tice), and this is entirely due to a
larger contribution of the D2O kick-out mechanism. This is an isotope effect:
the kick-out mechanism is more efficient for D2O ice, because the D atom formed
after D2O photodissociation has a larger momentum than photogenerated H atoms
from H2O, and D transfers momentum more easily to D2O than H to H2O. The total
yield has been compared with experiments and the total yield from previous
simulations. We find better agreement when we compare experimental yields with
calculated yields for D2O ice than when we compare with calculated yields for
H2O ice.

LCDM""), Gurzadyan and Penrose (2011) claim for the second time to find evidence
for pre-Big Bang activity in the form of concentric circles of low variance in
the WMAP data. The same claim was made in November 2010, but quickly shown to
be false by three independent groups. The culprit was simply that Gurzadyan and
Penrose's simulations were based on an inappropriate power spectrum. In the
most recent paper, they now claim that the significance is indeed low if the
simulations are based on the realization-specific WMAP spectrum (ie., the one
directly measured from the sky maps and affected by cosmic variance), but not
if the simulations are based on a theoretical LCDM spectrum. In this respect,
we note that the three independent reanalyses all based their simulations on
the LCDM spectrum, not the observed WMAP spectrum, and this alone should
suffice to show that the updated claims are also incorrect. In fact, it is
evident from the plots shown in their new paper that the spectrum is still
incorrect, although in a different way than in their first paper. Thus,
Gurzadyan and Penrose's new claims are just as wrong as those made in the first
paper, and for the same reason: The simulations are not based on an appropriate
power spectrum. Still, while this story is of little physical interest, it may
have some important implications in terms of scienctific sociology: Looking
back at the background papers leading up to the present series by Gurzadyan and
Penrose, in particular one introducing the Kolmogorov statistic, we believe one
can find evidence that a community based and open access referee process may be
more efficient at rejecting incorrect results and claims than a traditional
journal based approach.

selection of Latin squares can be decisive. A factor to take into account is
the symmetry that the experimental space must verify and which is established
by the autotopism group of each Latin square. Although the size of this group
is known for Latin squares of order up to 10, a classification of the different
symmetries has not yet been done. In this paper, given a cycle structure of a
Latin square autotopism, it is studied the regularity of the incidence
structure formed by the set of autotopisms having this cycle structure and the
set of Latin squares remaining stable by at least one of the previous
autotopisms. Moreover, it is proven that every substructure given by the
isotopism class of a Latin square is a 1-$(v,k,r)$ design. Since the
corresponding parameter $k$ is known for Latin squares of order up to 7, we
obtain the rest of the parameters of all these substructures and, consequently,
a classification of all possible symmetries is reached for these orders.

how the behavior of thermodynamical quantities such as the trace anomaly should
depend on the gauge algebra in both the confined and deconfined phase. The
obtained results compare favourably with recent and accurate lattice data in

strong for the blueshift of the total profile particularly. However, both

$\Theta=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)\in\mathfrak{A}_n$, we study in this paper the

pharmaceutical and food industries, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and
civil engineering. In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often
then to improve the degree of homogenisation of a substance being stirred,
referred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the
variance of the concentration of the scalar, which can be related to the $L^2$
norm of the concentration field. Recently other norms have been used to
quantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms.
These norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the
absence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in
the sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients
differently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the
applications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be
used to optimise the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then
review recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously-replenished
scalar field --- the source-sink problem. In that case the flows that optimally
reduce the norms are associated with transport rather than mixing: they push
sources onto sinks, and vice versa.

aggregation and interactions between synthetic materials and proteins. Using
all atom molecular simulations in implicit solvent we illustrate the effects of
nanoparticle size, shape, and volume fraction on oligomer formation of an
amyloidogenic peptide from the transthyretin protein. Surprisingly, we find
that inert spherical crowding particles destabilize in-register $\beta$-sheets
formed by dimers while stabilizing $\beta$-sheets comprised of trimers and
tetramers. As the radius of the nanoparticle increases crowding effects
decrease, implying smaller crowding particles have the largest influence on the
earliest amyloid species. We explain these results using a theory based on the
depletion effect. Finally, we show that spherocylindrical crowders destabilize
the ordered $\beta$-sheet dimer to a greater extent than spherical crowders,
which underscores the influence of nanoparticle shape on protein aggregation.

look for signatures of pressure broadening and macroscopic velocity structure.
We find that pressure broadening contributes significantly to the line widths,
but it is not the sole cause of the broad lines. We compare radio continuum and
dust emission distributions and find a good correspondence. We also discuss
maser emission and multi-wavelength observations reported in the literature for

of single particle's trajectories, which moves in a triangular array of rigid

length of trajectories and perform a level spacing analysis of the spectrum of
this matrix. We find that a universal behavior occurs both in level spacing
distribution and spectral rigidity. In order to examine diffusion in this
classical system, we investigate the variance of the length of trajectories
versus number of collisions to disks. In the case where there is a
finite-horizon, such a variance scales linearly with number of bounces. This
shows that a normal diffusion exists and a central limit theorem is maintained
in this regime.
