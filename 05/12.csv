interacting oscillatory units in physics and biology. The order parameter which
quantifies synchronization was so far found to be chaotic only in systems with
inhomogeneities. Here we show that even symmetric systems of identical
oscillators may not only exhibit chaotic dynamics, but also chaotically
fluctuating order parameters. Our findings imply that neither inhomogeneities
nor amplitude variations are necessary to obtain chaos, i.e., nonlinear
interactions of phases give rise to the necessary instabilities.

the Godunov code PLUTO, where the disk is turbulent due to the
magnetorotational instability. We study the migration for planets with
different planet-star mass ratios $q=M_{p}/M_{s}$. In agreement with previous
studies, for the low-mass planet cases ($q=5\times10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$),
migration is dominated by random fluctuations in the torque. For a Jupiter-mass
planet $(q=M_{p}/M_{s}=10^{-3}$ for $M_{s}=1M_{\odot})$, we find a reduction of
the magnetic stress inside the orbit of the planet and around the gap region.
After an initial stage where the torque on the planet is positive, it reverses
and we recover migration rates similar to those found in disks where the
turbulent viscosity is modelled by an $\alpha$ viscosity. For the
intermediate-mass planets ($q=5\times10^{-5}, 10^{-4}$ and $2\times10^{-4}$) we
find a new and so far unexpected behavior. In some cases they experience
sustained and systematic outwards migration for the entire duration of the
simulation. For this case, the horseshoe region is resolved and torques coming
from the corotation region can remain unsaturated due to the stresses in the
disk. These stresses are generated directly by the magnetic field. The
magnitude of the horseshoe drag can overcome the negative Lindblad contribution
when the local surface density profile is flat or increasing outwards, which we
see in certain locations in our simulations due to the presence of a zonal
flow. The intermediate-mass planet is migrating radially outwards in locations
where there is a positive gradient of a pressure bump (zonal flow).

limit of strong scattering, or large $\chi N$, but yield qualitatively
different predictions for symmetric copolymers far from the ODT and for

these particles is a significant indicator of the presence of fissionable
material. Cosmogenic processes can also mimic these types of correlated
signals. However, if the background is sufficiently low and fully
characterized, significant changes in the correlated event rate in the presence

Since fission emissions are isotropic, adequate sensitivity to these
multiplicities requires a high efficiency detector with a large solid angle
with respect to the target. Water Cerenkov detectors are a cost-effective
choice when large solid angle coverage is required. In order to characterize

control electromagnetic field in the terahertz regime. The mobility as a
function of bias possesses a large threshold value when entering a nonlinear
transport regime. This value depends on the temperature, electron density,
impurity scattering strength, nanoribbon width and correlation length for the
line-edge roughness. An enhanced electron mobility beyond this threshold has
been observed, which is related to the initially-heated electrons in high
energy states with a larger group velocity. However, this mobility enhancement
quickly reaches a maximum governed by the Fermi velocity in graphene and the
dramatically increased phonon scattering. Super-linear and sub-linear
temperature dependences of the mobility are seen in the linear and nonlinear
transport regimes, which is attributed separately to the results of sweeping
electrons from the right Fermi edge to the left one through elastic scattering
and moving electrons from low-energy states to high-energy ones through
field-induced electron heating. The threshold field is pushed up by a decreased
correlation length in the high field regime, and is further accompanied by a
reduced magnitude in the mobility enhancement. This implies an anomalous
high-field increase of the line-edge roughness scattering with decreasing
correlation length due to the occupation of high-energy states by field-induced
electron heating. Additionally, a self-consistent device modeling has been
proposed for graphene transistors under an optical modulation on its gate,
which employs Boltzmann moment equations up to the third order for describing
fast carrier dynamics and full wave electromagnetics coupled to the Boltzmann
equation for describing spatial-temporal dependence of the total field.

weighted estimate for the Haar shifts, which is linear in the $A_2$ norm of the
weight and in the complexity of the shift. Together with the representation of
a general Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operator as a weighted average (over all dyadic
lattices) of Haar shifts, (cf. arXiv:1010.0755v2[math.CA],
arXiv:1007.4330v1[math.CA]) it gives a significantly simpler proof of the
so-called the $A_2$ conjecture.
  The main estimate is a very general fact about concave functions, which can
be very useful in other problems of martingale Harmonic Analysis. Concave
functions of such type appear as the Bellman functions for bounds on the
bilinear form of martingale multipliers, thus the main estimate allows for the
transference of the results for simplest possible martingale multipliers to
more general martingale transforms.
  Note that (although this is not important for the $A_2$ conjecture for
general Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators) this elementary proof gives the best
known (linear) growth in the complexity of the shift.

oscillator dynamics. In the presence of dissipation, the role of nonlinearity
is strongly manifested in the steady state dynamics of the indirectly coupled
anharmonic oscillators. We further illustrate the effect of nonlinearities by
studying the coupling between an electromagnetic field in a cavity with one
movable mirror which is modeled as a nonlinear oscillator. For this case we
present a full analytical treatment, which is valid in a regime where both the
nonlinearity and the coupling due to radiation pressure is weak. We show that,
without the need of any conditional measurements on the cavity field, the state
of the movable mirror is non-classical as a result of the combined effect of
the intrinsic nonlinearity and the radiation pressure coupling. This
interaction is also shown to be responsible for squeezing the movable mirror's
position quadrature beyond the minimum uncertainty state even when the mirror

different k-modes in the initial Gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is not
true in real space: the values of the density field at a given spatial

nontrivial way. We show that when the excursion set approach is extended to
include such correlations, then one must be careful to account for the fact
that the associated prediction for halo bias is explicitly a real-space
quantity. Therefore, care must be taken when comparing the predictions of this
approach with measurements in simulations, which are typically made in

These remarkable properties come at a price: stout beers do not foam
spontaneously and special technology, such as the widgets used in cans, is
needed to promote foaming. Nevertheless the same mechanism, nucleation by gas
pockets trapped in cellulose fibres, responsible for foaming in carbonated
drinks is active in stout beers, but at an impractically slow rate. This gentle
rate of bubble nucleation makes stout beers an excellent model system for the
scientific investigation of the nucleation of gas bubbles. The equipment needed

in the practical design of MH-class algorithm implementations. Many

decoupling of simulation design from the constraints of data analysis. The
recording uses only one bit per sample, which is an upper bound on the rate at

arbitrary warmness of Dark Matter. An equivalent equation of state has been
used by Sakharov to predict the oscillations in the matter power spectrum. Two
kind of tests are accounted for in what follows, namely the ones coming from
the dynamics of the conformal factor of the homogeneous and isotropic metric

demonstrated its high effectiveness, permitting to explore a large volume in
the space of mentioned parameters in a rather economic way. Taking together the
results of such tests as Supernova type Ia (Union2 sample), $H(z)$, CMB ($R$

favored model. At the same time, for the 2dfGRS data alone we found that an
alternative model with a very small quantity of a Dark Matter is also viable.
This output is potentially relevant in view of the fact that the LSS is the
only test which can not be affected by the possible quantum contributions to
the low-energy gravitational action.

internal energy, entropy, and free energy as functionals of the local density
field. A central formal difficulty for an orbital-free representation is
construction of the corresponding functionals for non-interacting particles in
an arbitrary external potential. That problem is posed here in the context of
the equilibrium statistical mechanics of an inhomogeneous system. The density
functionals are defined and shown to be equal to the extremal state for a
functional of the reduced one-particle statistical operators. Convexity of the
latter functionals implies a class of general inequalities. First, it is shown
that the familiar von Weizs\""acker lower bound for zero temperature functionals
applies at finite temperature as well. An upper bound is obtained in terms of a
single-particle statistical operator corresponding to the Thomas-Fermi
approximation. Next, the behavior of the density functionals under coordinate
scaling is obtained. The inequalities are exploited to obtain a class of upper
and lower bounds at constant temperature, and a complementary class at constant
density. The utility of such constraints and their relationship to
corresponding results at zero temperature are discussed.

class of moves based on nonequilibrium dynamics: candidate configurations are
generated through a finite-time process in which a system is actively driven
out of equilibrium, and accepted with criteria that preserve the equilibrium
distribution. The acceptance rule is similar to the Metropolis acceptance
probability, but related to the nonequilibrium work rather than the
instantaneous energy difference. Our method is applicable to sampling from both
a single thermodynamic state or a mixture of thermodynamic states, and allows
both coordinates and thermodynamic parameters to be driven in nonequilibrium
proposals. While generating finite-time switching trajectories incurs an
additional cost, driving some degrees of freedom while allowing others to
evolve naturally can lead to large enhancements in acceptance probabilities,
greatly reducing structural correlation times. Using nonequilibrium driven
processes vastly expands the repertoire of useful Monte Carlo proposals in
simulations of dense solvated systems.

increases extinction risk by reducing the average per-capita growth rate of
populations. To understand the interactive effects of environmental
stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and dispersal on population growth, we
study the following model for population abundances in $n$ patches: the
conditional law of $X_{t+dt}$ given $X_t=x$ is such that when $dt$ is small the
conditional mean of $X_{t+dt}^i-X_t^i$ is approximately $[x^i\mu_i+\sum_j(x^j
D_{ji}-x^i D_{ij})]dt$, where $X_t^i$ and $\mu_i$ are the abundance and per
capita growth rate in the $i$-th patch respectivly, and $D_{ij}$ is the
dispersal rate from the $i$-th to the $j$-th patch, and the conditional
covariance of $X_{t+dt}^i-X_t^i$ and $X_{t+dt}^j-X_t^j$ is approximately $x^i
x^j \sigma_{ij}dt$. We show for such a spatially extended population that if
$S_t=(X_t^1+...+X_t^n)$ is the total population abundance, then $Y_t=X_t/S_t$,
the vector of patch proportions, converges in law to a random vector $Y_\infty$
as $t\to\infty$, and the stochastic growth rate $\lim_{t\to\infty}t^{-1}\log
S_t$ equals the space-time average per-capita growth rate
$\sum_i\mu_i\E[Y_\infty^i]$ experienced by the population minus half of the
space-time average temporal variation $\E[\sum_{i,j}\sigma_{ij}Y_\infty^i
Y_\infty^j]$ experienced by the population. We derive analytic results for the
law of $Y_\infty$, find which choice of the dispersal mechanism $D$ produces an
optimal stochastic growth rate for a freely dispersing population, and
investigate the effect on the stochastic growth rate of constraints on
dispersal rates. Our results provide fundamental insights into ""ideal free""
movement in the face of uncertainty, the persistence of coupled sink
populations, the evolution of dispersal rates, and the single large or several

hot L-dwarfs has become a promising tool to search for rocky planets as well as
to follow-up planetary candidates around dwarfs found by transit surveys. These
stars are faint at optical wavelengths, as their spectral flux distribution
peaks at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. For this reason, it is desirable to
measure the radial velocities in this wavelength regime. However, in the NIR
there are only very few medium- and high-resolution spectrographs available
which are mounted at large telescopes. In the near future, high-resolution
spectrographs for the NIR will be built, which will allow us to search for
rocky planets around cool M-dwarfs and L-dwarfs from radial velocities
monitoring.
  Methods. Stellar atmosphere synthetic models for an M- and an L-dwarf with
temperatures of 2200 K and 1800 K, respectively, and a theoretical spectrum of
the Earth's transmission in the spectral range from 0.9 to 2.5 \mum are used.
We simulate a series of Doppler-shifted spectra observed with different
resolving powers and signal-to-noise ratios, and for different rotational
broadenings of the dwarf. For different combinations of the input parameters we
recover the radial velocity by means of cross-correlation with a high
signal-to-noise ratio template and determine the associate uncertainties.
  Results. The highest precision in radial velocity measurements for the cool
M-dwarf is found in the Y band around 1.0 \mum, while for the L-dwarf it is
determined in the J band around 1.25 \mum. We note that synthetic models may
lack of some faint absorption features or underestimate their abundances.
Conversely, some instrumental/calibration aspects that are not taken into
account in our estimations would rise the uncertainties.

the formation of substructure and the growth of reionization bubbles due to the

redshifts of satellite candidates. We do this for four different reionization
models, and also compare results to instantaneous reionization. Using a simple
procedure for selecting satellites and assigning luminosities in the
simulations, we compare the resulting satellite populations. We find that the
overall number of satellites depends sensitively on the reionization model,
with a factor of 3-4 variation between the four models for a given host halo,
although the difference is entirely in the population of faint satellites (M_V
> -10). In addition, we find that for a given reionization model the total
number of satellites differs by 10%-20% between the patchy and homogeneous
scenarios, provided that the redshift is chosen appropriately for the
instantaneous case. However, the halo-halo scatter from the six Aquarius halos
is large, up to a factor of 2-3, and so is comparable to the difference between
reionization scenarios. In order to use the population of faint dwarf galaxies

interstellar medium into its atomic and molecular hydrogen components, using
the galaxy formation model GALFORM in the LCDM framework. We calculate the
molecular-to-atomic hydrogen mass ratio, H2/HI, in each galaxy using two
different approaches; the pressure-based empirical relation of Blitz &
Rosolowsky and the theoretical model of Krumholz, McKeee & Tumlinson, and apply
them to consistently calculate the star formation rates of galaxies. We find
that the model based on the Blitz & Rosolowsky law predicts an HI mass
function, CO(1-0) luminosity function, correlations between the H2/HI ratio and
stellar and cold gas mass, and infrared-CO luminosity relation in good
agreement with local and high redshift observations. The HI mass function
evolves weakly with redshift, with the number density of high mass galaxies
decreasing with increasing redshift. In the case of the H2 mass function, the
number density of massive galaxies increases strongly from z=0 to z=2, followed
by weak evolution up to z=4. We also find that the H2/HI ratio of galaxies is
strongly dependent on stellar and cold gas mass, and also on redshift. The
slopes of the correlations between H2/HI and stellar and cold gas mass hardly
evolve, but the normalisation increases by up to two orders of magnitude from
z=0-8. The strong evolution in the H2 mass function and the H2/HI ratio is
primarily due to the evolution in the sizes of galaxies and secondarily, in the
gas fractions. The predicted cosmic density evolution of HI agrees with the
observed evolution inferred from DLAs, and is dominated by low/intermediate
mass halos. We find that previous theoretical studies have largely
overestimated the redshift evolution of the global H2/HI ratio due to limited
resolution. We predict a maximum of rho_H2/rho_HI~1.2 at z~3.5.

accurately modelled by assuming light traces mass, successfully uncovering
large numbers of multiple-images. Approximate critical curves and the effective

distribution of member galaxies and scaled by their luminosities. We use a
subsample of 10 well-studied clusters covered by both SDSS and HST to calibrate

the first 10,000 clusters analysed in the range $0.1<z<0.55$, and compare them

genuine high-z candidates from intermediate redshift (z~2-4) galaxies with

of intermediate brightness (H_160~24-26 mag) with strong IRAC detections, we
only find one plausible z~10 galaxy candidate in the whole data set, previously
reported in Bouwens et al. (2011). The newer data cover a 3x larger area and
provide much stronger constraints on the evolution of the UV luminosity
function (LF). If the evolution of the z~4-8 LFs is extrapolated to z~10, six
z~10 galaxies are expected in our data. The detection of only one source
suggests that the UV LF evolves at an accelerated rate before z~8. The
luminosity density is found to increase by more than an order of magnitude in
only 170 Myr from z~10 to z~8. This increase is >=4x larger than expected from
the lower redshift extrapolation of the UV LF. We are thus likely witnessing
the first rapid build-up of galaxies in the heart of cosmic reionization.
Future deep HST WFC3/IR data, reaching to well beyond 29 mag, can enable a more
robust quantification of the accelerated evolution around z~10.

interpretation of anomalous microwave emission. In this paper, we present a
method to calculate the rotational emission from small grains of irregular
shape with moments of inertia $I_{1}> I_{2}> I_{3}$. We show that a torque-free
rotating irregular grain with a given angular momentum radiates at multiple
frequency modes. The resulting spinning dust spectrum has peak frequency and
emissivity increasing with the degree of grain shape irregularity, which is
defined by $I_{1}:I_{2}:I_{3}$. We discuss how the orientation of dipole moment
$\bmu$ in body coordinates affects the spinning dust spectrum for different
regimes of internal thermal fluctuations. We show that the spinning dust
emissivity for the case of strong thermal fluctuations is less sensitive to the
orientation of $\bmu$ than in the case of weak thermal fluctuations. We
calculate spinning dust spectra for a range of gas density and dipole moment.
The effect of compressible turbulence on spinning dust emission intensity is
investigated. We show that the emission intensity in a turbulent medium
increases by a factor from 1.2-1.4 relative to that in a uniform medium, as
sonic Mach number $M_{s}$ increases from 2-7. Finally, spinning dust parameters
are constrained by fitting our improved model to five-year {\it Wilkinson

discrete memoryless broadcast channel with generalized feedback. The coding
strategy involves block-Markov superposition coding, using Marton's coding
scheme for the broadcast channel without feedback as the starting point. If the
message rates in the Marton scheme are too high to be decoded at the end of a
block, each receiver is left with a list of messages compatible with its
output. Resolution information is sent in the following block to enable each
receiver to resolve its list. The key observation is that the resolution
information of the first receiver is correlated with that of the second. This
correlated information is efficiently transmitted via joint source-channel
coding, using ideas similar to the Han-Costa coding scheme. Using the result,
we obtain an achievable rate region for the stochastically degraded AWGN
broadcast channel with noisy feedback from only one receiver. It is shown that
this region is strictly larger than the no-feedback capacity region.

the new method leads to superresolution but with higher detection efficiency.

ratio, 0.35-2 keV luminosity ($\sim6\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and size
($\sim20$ pc) consistent with that of a supernova remnant, although the low

galaxy IOK-1 at z=6.96. The sensitivity of this measurement is >5x deeper than
for previous measurements. From this deep narrowband imaging, combined with
broadband observations in the F125W and F160W filters, we find the He II flux
to be 1.2+/- 1.0x 10^-18 ergs/s/cm^2, corresponding to a 1\sigma upper limit on
the Pop III star formation rate (SFR) of ~ 0.5 M_sun/yr for the case of a
Salpeter IMF with 50-500M_sun and mass loss. Given that the broadband
measurements can be fit with a UV continuum spectral flux density of ~ 4.85x
10^-10x \lambda ^-2.46 ergs/s/cm^2/A, which corresponds to an overall SFR of
~16+/-2.6 M_sun/yr, massive Pop III stars represent < 6% of the total star
formation. This measurement places the strongest limit yet on metal-free star
formation at high redshift, although the exact conversion from He II luminosity
to Pop III SFR is highly uncertain due to the unknown IMF, stellar evolution,
and photoionization effects. Although we have not detected He II \lambda 1640

catalog for the galaxies in the SDSS DR8 imaging area that, after masking,
covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). We investigate
fluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function of
Galactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,
photometric offset, and North/South Galactic hemisphere. We find that the
presence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are not
traditionally masked) effectively remove area. Failing to correct for such
stars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlation
function, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. We describe how
one can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing any
galaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. Additionally, we
apply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errors
imparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. We find
that failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces a
systematic error on w. We measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05

for the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generally

(re)heating, for application to exoplanets such as the asymmetrically heated
""hot Jupiters"" and gas giants on highly eccentric orbits. We establish that an
understanding of the dominant drag mechanisms and their dependence on local
atmospheric conditions is critical for accurate modeling, not just in their
ability to limit wind speeds, but also because they could possibly change the
energetics of the circulation enough to alter the nature of the flow. We
discuss possible sources of drag and estimate the strength necessary to
significantly influence the atmospheric energetics. As we show, the frictional
heating depends on the magnitude of kinetic energy dissipation as well as its
spatial variation, so that the more localized a drag mechanism is, the weaker
it can be and still affect the circulation. We also use the derived formalism
to estimate the rate of numerical loss of kinetic energy in a few previously
published hot Jupiter models with and without magnetic drag and find it to be
surprisingly large, at 5-10% of the incident stellar irradiation.

Pole recorded 32 billion muons generated in air showers produced by cosmic rays
with a median energy of 20 TeV. With a data set of this size, it is possible to
probe the southern sky for per-mille anisotropy on all angular scales in the
arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays. Applying a power spectrum
analysis to the relative intensity map of the cosmic ray flux in the southern
hemisphere, we show that the arrival direction distribution is not isotropic,
but shows significant structure on several angular scales. In addition to
previously reported large-scale structure in the form of a strong dipole and
quadrupole, the data show small-scale structure on scales between 15 degrees
and 30 degrees. The skymap exhibits several localized regions of significant
excess and deficit in cosmic ray intensity. The relative intensity of the
smaller-scale structures is about a factor of 5 weaker than that of the dipole
and quadrupole structure. The most significant structure, an excess localized
at right ascension 122.4 degrees and declination -47.4 degrees, extends over at
least 20 degrees in right ascension and has a post-trials significance of 5.3
sigma. The origin of this anisotropy is still unknown.

producing stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and may be critical to
account for SN Ib/c progenitors. RY Scuti is an extremely rare example of a
massive binary star caught in this brief but important phase. Its toroidal
nebula indicates equatorial mass loss during RLOF, while the mass-gaining star
is apparently embedded in an opaque accretion disk. RY Scuti's toroidal nebula
has two components: an inner ionised double-ring system, and an outer dust
torus that is twice the size of the ionised rings. We present two epochs of
Lband Keck NGS-AO images of the dust torus, plus three epochs of HST images of
the ionised gas rings. Proper motions show that the inner ionised rings and the
outer dust torus came from two separate ejection events roughly 130 and 250 yr
ago. This suggests that RLOF in massive contact binaries can be accompanied by
eruptive and episodic burst of mass loss, reminiscent of LBVs. We speculate
that the repeating outbursts may arise in the mass gainer from instabilities
associated with a high accretion rate. If discrete mass-loss episodes in other
RLOF binaries are accompanied by luminous outbursts, they might contribute to
the population of extragalactic optical transients. When RLOF ends for RY
Scuti, the overluminous mass gainer, currently surrounded by an accretion disk,
will probably become a B[e] supergiant and may outshine the hotter mass-donor
star that should die as a Type Ib/c supernova.

backaction-evading optical measurement of a microwave quadrature. In this

red-sideband optical pumping, the relations are shown to resemble those of a
beam splitter for the traveling fields, so that in the ideal case of zero
parasitic loss and critical coupling, microwave photons can be coherently
up-converted to ""flying"" optical photons with unit efficiency, and vice versa.
With blue-sideband pumping, the modulator acts as a nondegenerate parametric
amplifier, which can generate two-mode squeezing and hybrid entangled photon
pairs at optical and microwave frequencies. These fundamental operations
provide a potential bridge between circuit quantum electrodynamics and quantum
optics.

setting, wherein a user queries the system by providing a song, and the system
responds with a list of relevant or similar song recommendations. Such
applications ultimately depend on the notion of similarity between items to
produce high-quality results. Current state-of-the-art systems employ
collaborative filter methods to represent musical items, effectively comparing
items in terms of their constituent users. While collaborative filter
techniques perform well when historical data is available for each item, their
reliance on historical data impedes performance on novel or unpopular items. To
combat this problem, practitioners rely on content-based similarity, which
naturally extends to novel items, but is typically out-performed by
collaborative filter methods.
  In this article, we propose a method for optimizing contentbased similarity
by learning from a sample of collaborative filter data. The optimized
content-based similarity metric can then be applied to answer queries on novel

proposed system yields accurate and efficient representations of audio content,
and experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy over

the medium induced dynamics, that are still not well understood. In particular,
there is a broadening and even a double hump structure of the away-side peak
appearing in azimuthal correlation studies in Au+Au collisions which is absent
in p+p collisions at the same energies. These features are already present but
suppressed in p+p collisions: 2 to 3 parton processes produce such structures

bottom-up process considered are $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves prominent in synaptic

$\mathbf{A}$ on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ momentum, $\mathbf{p}$. The canonical
momentum of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, $\mathbf{\Pi} =
\mathbf{p} + q \mathbf{A}$ (SI units), is calculated, where the charge of
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is $q = - 2 e$, $e$ is the magnitude of the charge of an

quite influential on the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions, in
both classical and quantum mechanics. Molecular scales of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
wave dynamics are coupled with $\mathbf{A}$ fields developed at macroscopic
regional scales measured by coherent neuronal firing activity measured by scalp
EEG. The project has three main aspects: fitting $\mathbf{A}$ models to EEG
data as reported here, building tripartite models to develop $\mathbf{A}$
models, and studying long coherence times of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves in the
presence of $\mathbf{A}$ due to coherent neuronal firings measured by scalp
EEG. The SMNI model supports a mechanism wherein the $\mathbf{p} + q
\mathbf{A}$ interaction at tripartite synapses, via a dynamic centering
mechanism (DCM) to control background synaptic activity, acts to maintain
short-term memory (STM) during states of selective attention.

disorder strength suggests a cross-over from weakly localized to a very weakly

from algebraic graph theory, group theory, dynamical systems, and statistical
physics. A graph's sandpile group is part of a larger algebraic structure on
the graph, known as its sandpile monoid. Most of the work on sandpiles so far
has focused on the sandpile group rather than the sandpile monoid of a graph,
and has also assumed the underlying graph to be undirected. A notable exception
is the recent work of Babai and Toumpakari, which builds up the theory of
sandpile monoids on directed graphs from scratch and provides many connections
between the combinatorics of a graph and the algebraic aspects of its sandpile
monoid.
  In this paper we primarily consider sandpile monoids on directed graphs, and
we extend the existing theory in four main ways. First, we give a combinatorial
classification of the maximal subgroups of a sandpile monoid on a directed
graph in terms of the sandpile groups of certain easily-identifiable subgraphs.
Second, we point out certain sandpile results for undirected graphs that are
really results for sandpile monoids on directed graphs that contain exactly two
idempotents. Third, we give a new algebraic constraint that sandpile monoids
must satisfy and exhibit two infinite families of monoids that cannot be
realized as sandpile monoids on any graph. Finally, we give an explicit
combinatorial description of the sandpile group identity for every graph in a
family of directed graphs which generalizes the family of (undirected)
distance-regular graphs. This family includes many other graphs of interest,
including iterated wheels, regular trees, and regular tournaments.

\pi-pulses, and investigate their inherent robustness to uncertainty in the
magnitude of the drift Hamiltonian. Next, we construct a quantum-control

pulse criteria and optimal control theory for unitary operations. By
perturbatively expanding the unitary time-evolution operator for an open
quantum system, previous analysis of environment-decoupling control pulses has
calculated explicit control-field criteria to suppress environment-induced
errors up to (but not including) third order from \pi/2- and \pi-pulses. We
systematically integrate this criteria with optimal control theory,
incorporating an estimate of the uncertain parameter, to produce improvements
in gate fidelity and robustness, demonstrated via a numerical example based on
double quantum dot qubits. For the qubit model used in this work, post facto
analysis of the resulting controls suggests that realistic control-field
fluctuations and noise may contribute just as significantly to gate errors as

perovskite manganite NdBaMn$_2$O$_6$, which has the $A$-type (layered)
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Electrons (holes) are introduced by
partial substitution of Ba$^{2+}$ (Nd$^{3+}$) with Nd$^{3+}$ (Ba$^{2+}$).
Electron-doping generates ferromagnetic (FM) clusters in the $A$-type AFM
matrix. With increasing the electron-doping level, the volume fraction of the
FM phase or the number of the FM clusters is abruptly increasing. In contrast,
the $A$-type AFM phase is robust against the hole-doping, and no FM correlation
is observed in the hole-doped NdBaMn$_2$O$_6$.

spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and ground-based high-angular resolution
mid-infrared spectroscopy of 13 nearby Seyfert galaxies. This allowed us to put
tight constraints on torus model parameters such as the viewing angle, the
radial thickness of the torus Y, the angular size of the cloud distribution
sigma_torus, and the average number of clouds along radial equatorial rays N_0.
The viewing angle is not the only parameter controlling the classification of a
galaxy into a type 1 or a type 2. In principle type 2s could be viewed at any
viewing angle as long as there is one cloud along the line of sight. A more
relevant quantity for clumpy media is the probability for an AGN photon to
escape unabsorbed. In our sample, type 1s have relatively high escape
probabilities, while in type 2s, as expected, tend to be low. Our fits also
confirmed that the tori of Seyfert galaxies are compact with torus model radii
in the range 1-6pc. The scaling of the models to the data also provided the AGN
bolometric luminosities, which were found to be in good agreement with
estimates from the literature. When we combined our sample of Seyfert galaxies
with a sample of PG quasars from the literature to span a range of
L_bol(AGN)~10^{43}-10^{47}erg/s, we found plausible evidence of the receding
torus. That is, there is a tendency for the torus geometrical covering factor
to be lower at high AGN luminosities than at low AGN luminosities. This is
because at low AGN luminosities the tori appear to have wider angular sizes and
more clouds along radial equatorial rays. We cannot, however rule out the
possibility that this is due to contamination by extended dust structures not
associated with the dusty torus at low AGN luminosities, since most of these in
our sample are hosted in highly inclined galaxies. (Abridged)

saturated regime in which non-linear effects such as bistability play an
important role. From the universal behavior of the Jaynes-Cummings model with

training based reciprocal Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) system, with (i)
perfect Channel State Information (CSI) at the Receiver (CSIR) and noisy CSI at
the Transmitter (CSIT), and (ii) noisy CSIR and noisy CSIT. In both the cases,
the CSIT is acquired through Reverse Channel Training (RCT), i.e., by sending a
training sequence from the receiver to the transmitter. A channel-dependent
fixed-power training scheme is proposed for acquiring CSIT, along with a
forward-link data transmit power control scheme. With perfect CSIR, the
proposed scheme is shown to achieve a diversity order that is quadratically
increasing with the number of receive antennas. This is in contrast with
conventional orthogonal RCT schemes, where the diversity order is known to
saturate as the number of receive antennas is increased, for a given channel
coherence time. Moreover, the proposed scheme can achieve a larger DMT compared
to the orthogonal training scheme. With noisy CSIR and noisy CSIT, a three-way
training scheme is proposed and its DMT performance is analyzed. It is shown
that nearly the same diversity order is achievable as in the perfect CSIR case.
The time-overhead in the training schemes is explicitly accounted for in this
work, and the results show that the proposed channel-dependent RCT and data
power control schemes offer a significant improvement in terms of the DMT,
compared to channel-agnostic orthogonal RCT schemes. The outage performance of
the proposed scheme is illustrated through Monte-Carlo simulations.

zone of a fast moving red supergiant star, where the circumstellar and

familiar bow shock, contact discontinuity, and wind termination shock
morphology forms, with localized instability development. Our model includes a
detailed treatment of dust grains in the stellar wind, and takes into account
the drag forces between dust and gas. The dust is treated as pressureless gas
components binned per grainsize, for which we use ten representative grainsize
bins. Our simulations allow to deduce how dust grains of varying sizes become
distributed throughout the circumstellar medium. We show that smaller dust
grains (radius <0.045 micro-meters) tend to be strongly bound to the gas and
therefore follow the gas density distribution closely, with intricate
finestructure due to essentially hydrodynamical instabilities at the
wind-related contact discontinuity. Larger grains which are more resistant to
drag forces are shown to have their own unique dust distribution, with
progressive deviations from the gas morphology. Specifically, small dust grains
stay entirely within the zone bound by shocked wind material. The large grains
are capable of leaving the shocked wind layer, and can penetrate into the
shocked or even unshocked interstellar medium. Depending on how the number of
dust grains varies with grainsize, this should leave a clear imprint in
infrared observations of bowshocks of red supergiants and other evolved stars.

(e.g. M-dwarfs) may be longer lived than their solar-type counterparts. This
question is particularly relevant to assess the planet-making potential of
these lower mass discs. Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young
stars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial
distribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of
disc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference
between the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest
neighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older
population should appear more spread out.
  To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial
distribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low
mass star forming regions. We find no evidence for significant age differences
between the disc-bearing low-mass (later than M2) and 'solar-type' (earlier
than M2) stars in these regions. We model our results by constructing and
analysing synthetic fractal distributions that we evolve for typical values of
the velocity dispersions. A comparison of simple models to our MST analysis
suggests that the lifetime of discs around M-stars is similar to that of discs
around solar-type stars. Furthermore, a model-independent spatial analysis of
the observations robustly shows that any age differences between the two
samples must be smaller than the average age difference between disc-bearing
classical T-Tauri stars and disc-less Weak-Lined T-Tauri stars.

Temperature-dependent spontaneous imbibition experiments on 8OCB reveal the
existence of a paranematic phase due to the molecular alignment induced by the

present velocity gradient in the pores is likely to further enhance this
ordering phenomenon and prevent any layering in molecular stacks, eventually

It is a review of the biophysical mechanisms that underly cell motility. It
mainly focuses on the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and cell-motility mechanisms.
Bacterial motility as well as the composition of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton
is only briefly mentioned. The article is organized as follows. In Section III,
I first present an overview of the diversity of cellular motility mechanisms,
which might at first glance be categorized into two different types of
behaviors, namely ""swimming"" and ""crawling"". Intracellular transport, mitosis -
or cell division - as well as other extensions of cell motility that rely on
the same essential machinery are briefly sketched. In Section IV, I introduce
the molecular machinery that underlies cell motility - the cytoskeleton - as
well as its interactions with the external environment of the cell and its main
regulatory pathways. Sections IV D to IV F are more detailed in their
biochemical presentations; readers primarily interested in the theoretical
modeling of cell motility might want to skip these sections in a first reading.
I then describe the motility mechanisms that rely essentially on
polymerization-depolymerization dynamics of cytoskeleton filaments in Section
V, and the ones that rely essentially on the activity of motor proteins in
Section VI. Finally, Section VII is devoted to the description of the
integrated approaches that have been developed recently to try to understand
the cooperative phenomena that underly self-organization of the cell
cytoskeleton as a whole.

  doi:10.1613/jair.4164",,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new measure of the discrepancy in strategic games between the
social welfare in a Nash equilibrium and in a social optimum, that we call
selfishness level. It is the smallest fraction of the social welfare that needs
to be offered to each player to achieve that a social optimum is realized in a
pure Nash equilibrium. The selfishness level is unrelated to the price of
stability and the price of anarchy and is invariant under positive linear
transformations of the payoff functions. Also, it naturally applies to other
solution concepts and other forms of games.
  We study the selfishness level of several well-known strategic games. This
allows us to quantify the implicit tension within a game between players'
individual interests and the impact of their decisions on the society as a
whole. Our analyses reveal that the selfishness level often provides a deeper
understanding of the characteristics of the underlying game that influence the
players' willingness to cooperate.
  In particular, the selfishness level of finite ordinal potential games is
finite, while that of weakly acyclic games can be infinite. We derive explicit
bounds on the selfishness level of fair cost sharing games and linear
congestion games, which depend on specific parameters of the underlying game
but are independent of the number of players. Further, we show that the
selfishness level of the $n$-players Prisoner's Dilemma is $c/(b(n-1)-c)$,
where $b$ and $c$ are the benefit and cost for cooperation, respectively, that
of the $n$-players public goods game is $(1-\frac{c}{n})/(c-1)$, where $c$ is
the public good multiplier, and that of the Traveler's Dilemma game is
$\frac{1}{2}(b-1)$, where $b$ is the bonus. Finally, the selfishness level of
Cournot competition (an example of an infinite ordinal potential game, Tragedy
of the Commons, and Bertrand competition is infinite.

in the two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice with
or without easy-plane anisotropy. The model takes account of competing
interactions: a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interaction $J_1$ and an
antiferromagnetic third nearest-neighbor interaction $J_3$. As a result, the
ground state is a spiral spin configuration for $-4 < J_1/J_3 < 0$. In this
structure, global spin rotation cannot compensate for the effect of 120-degree
lattice rotation, in contrast to the conventional 120-degree structure of the
nearest-neighbor interaction model. We find that this model exhibits a
first-order phase transition with breaking of the lattice rotation symmetry at
a finite temperature. The transition is characterized as a $Z_2$ vortex
dissociation in the isotropic case, whereas it can be viewed as a $Z$ vortex
dissociation in the anisotropic case. Remarkably, the latter is continuously
connected to the former as the magnitude of anisotropy decreases, in contrast
to the recent work by Misawa and Motome [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. \textbf{79} (2010)

for explaining the origin of approximately half of the A>60 stable nuclei
observed in nature. In recent years nuclear astrophysicists have developed more
and more sophisticated r-process models, by adding new astrophysical or nuclear
physics ingredients to explain the solar system composition in a satisfactory
way. Despite these efforts, the astrophysical site of the r-process remains
unidentified. The composition of the neutron star outer crust material is
investigated after the decompression that follows its possible ejection. The
composition of the outer crust of a neutron star is estimated before and after
decompression. Two different possible initial conditions are considered, namely
an idealized crust composed of cold catalyzed matter and a crust initially in
nuclear statistical equilibrium at temperatures around 10 GK. We show that in
this second case before decompression and at temperatures typically
corresponding to 8 GK, the Coulomb effect due to the high densities in the
crust leads to an overall composition of the outer crust in neutron-rich nuclei
with a mass distribution close to the solar system r-abundance distribution.
Such distributions differ, however, from the solar one due to a systematic
shift in the second peak to lower values. After decompression, the capture of
the few neutrons per seed nucleus available in the hot outer crust leads to a
final distribution of stable neutron-rich nuclei with a mass distribution of 80
< A < 140 nuclei in excellent agreement with the solar distribution, provided
the outer crust is initially at temperatures around 8 GK and all layers of the
outer crust are ejected. The decompression of the neutron star matter from the
outer crust provides suitable conditions for a robust r-processing of the light
species, i.e., r-nuclei with A < 140.

could carry significant implications as to the distribution of dark matter in

kinematical analysis of two Sculptor group galaxies, NGC 247 and NGC 300. The
Fabry-Perot data were taken at the 36-cm Marseille Telescope in La Silla,
Chile, offering a large field of view. With almost 20 hours of observations for
each galaxy, very faint diffuse emission is detected. Typical emission measures
of 0.1 cm^-6 pc are reached. For NGC 247, emission extending up to a radius
comparable with that of the HI disc (r~13') is found, but no emission is seen
beyond the HI disc. For NGC 300, we detect ionized gas on the entirety of our
field of view (r_max~14'), and find that the bright HII regions are embedded in
a diffuse background. Using the deep data, extended optical rotation curves are
obtained, as well as mass models. These are the most extended optical rotation
curves thus far for these galaxies. We find no evidence suggesting that NGC 247
has a warped disc, and to account for our non detection of Halpha emission
beyond its HI disc, as opposed to the warped galaxy NGC 253, our results favour

i.e., an ecosystem constructed out of so-called digital organisms (see below),
that can foster the development of novel distributed services. In this context,
a human user equipped with his/her own mobile devices, can be though of as a
digital organism (DO), a subsystem characterized by a set of peculiar features
and resources it can offer to the rest of the ecosystem for use from its peer
DOs. The internal organization of the DO must address issues of management of
its own resources, including power consumption. Inside the DO and among DOs,
peer-to-peer interaction mechanisms can be conveniently deployed to favor
resource sharing and data dissemination. Throughout this paper, we show that
most of the solutions and technologies needed to construct a digital ecosystem
are already available. What is still missing is a framework (i.e., mechanisms,
protocols, services) that can support effectively the integration and
cooperation of these technologies. In addition, in the following we show that
that framework can be implemented as a middleware subsystem that enables novel
and ubiquitous forms of computation and communication. Finally, in order to
illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce some experimental

executed atomically, ie every robot that is activated at instant t
instantaneously executes a full cycle between t and t+1. ATOM being strictly
stronger than CORDA, all impossibility results in ATOM also hold in CORDA. We
show that it is impossible to explore a grid of at least three nodes with less
than three robots in ATOM. (This first result holds for both deterministic and
probabilistic settings.) Next, we show that it is impossible to
deterministically explore a (2,2)-Grid with less than 4 robots, and a
(3,3)-Grid with less than 5 robots, respectively. Then, we propose
deterministic algorithms in CORDA to exhibit the optimal number of robots

compressible astrophysics code, CASTRO. CASTRO uses an Eulerian grid with
block-structured adaptive mesh refinement based on a nested hierarchy of
logically-rectangular variable-sized grids with simultaneous refinement in both
space and time. The gray radiation solver is based on a mixed-frame formulation
of radiation hydrodynamics. In our approach, the system is split into two
parts, one part that couples the radiation and fluid in a hyperbolic subsystem,
and another parabolic part that evolves radiation diffusion and source-sink
terms. The hyperbolic subsystem is solved explicitly with a high-order Godunov
scheme, whereas the parabolic part is solved implicitly with a first-order
backward Euler method.

exploration could provide a useful tool for a better understanding of the early
Universe because they belong to the most distant and violent objects that
astronomers know. This thesis tries to bring more information about a so-called
group of intermediate-duration bursts claimed by different authors employing
different data samples. Firstly, duration and spectral hardness properties of
bursts from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager are
statistically analysed. The obtained results bring a suspicion that these
intermediate bursts gather into a separate group. Secondly, these bursts are
investigated in more detail with respect to their spectral lags, peak count
rates, redshifts, supernova observations, and so forth. Thirdly, long-duration
bursts with known redshifts and with derived pseudo-redshifts detected by The
Burst and Transient Source Experiment, Swift and Fermi bursts with known
redshifts, are used to study the cosmological effects on the observed flux and
fluence distributions.

We investigate the H-alpha observations of the flare events made with a 15 cm
solar tower telescope at ARIES, Nainital, India. The propagation
characteristics of the CMEs have been derived from the three-dimensional images
of the solar wind (i.e., density and speed) obtained from the interplanetary
scintillation data, supplemented with other ground- and space-based
measurements. The TRACE, SXI and H-alpha observations revealed two successive
ejections (of speeds ~350 and ~100 km/s), originating from the same filament
channel, which were associated with two high speed CMEs (~1223 and ~1660 km/s,
respectively). These two ejections generated propagating fast shock waves
(i.e., fast drifting type II radio bursts) in the corona. The interaction of
these CMEs along the Sun-Earth line has led to the severity of the storm.
According to our investigation, the interplanetary medium consisted of two
merging magnetic clouds (MCs) that preserved their identity during their
propagation. These magnetic clouds made the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
southward for a long time, which reconnected with the geomagnetic field,
resulting the super-storm (Dst_peak=-472 nT) on the Earth.

jets and the observational implications of numerical simulations of
relativistic jets in two dimensions. We confirm earlier numerical results that
sideways expansion of relativistic jets during the bulk of the afterglow
emission phase is logarithmic in time and find that this also applies to narrow
jets with half opening angle of 0.05 radians. As a result, afterglow jets
remain highly nonspherical until after they have become nonrelativistic.
Although sideways expansion steepens the afterglow light curve after the jet
break, the jet edges becoming visible dominates the jet break, which means that
the jet break is sensitive to the observer angle even for narrow jets. Failure
to take the observer angle into account can lead to an overestimation of the
jet energy by up to a factor 4. This weakens the challenge posed to the
magneter energy limit by extreme events such as GRB090926A. Late time radio
calorimetry based on a spherical nonrelativistic outflow model remains relevant
when the observer is approximately on-axis and where differences of a few in
flux level between the model and the simulation are acceptable. However, this
does not imply sphericity of the outflow and therefore does not translate to
high observer angles relevant to orphan afterglows. For more accurate
calorimetry and in order to model significant late time features such as the
rise of the counterjet, detailed jet simulations remain indispensable.

for atoms incident at velocities ~1 mm/s, achieved in recent experiments. This
enhancement is brought about by weakening the Casimir-Polder attraction between
the atom and the surface, which induces the quantum reflection. We show that
suspended graphene membranes also produce higher quantum reflection
probabilities than bulk matter. Temporal changes in the electrical resistance
of such membranes, produced as atoms stick to the surface, can be used to
monitor the reflection process, non-invasively and in real time. The resistance
change allows the reflection probability to be determined purely from
electrical measurements without needing to image the reflected atom cloud
optically. Finally, we show how perfect atom mirrors may be manufactured from
semiconductor heterostructures, which employ an embedded two-dimensional

performed wavelet and principal component analysis in the data in order to
remove instrumental signatures. An old stellar population component (age > 5
Gyr) is dominant within the inner ~ 130 pc which we attribute to the galaxy
bulge. Beyond this region, up to the borders of the observation field, young to
intermediate age components (0.1--0.7 Gyr) dominate. As for Mrk 1066,
previously studied by us, we find a spatial correlation between this
intermediate age component and a partial ring of low stellar velocity
dispersions (sigma*). Low-sigma* nuclear rings have been observed in other
active galaxies and our results for Mrk 1157 and Mrk 1066 reveal that they are
formed by intermediate age stars. Such age is consistent with a scenario in
which the origin of the low-sigma* rings is a past event which triggered an
inflow of gas and formed stars which still keep the colder kinematics of the
gas from which they have formed. No evidence for the presence of an unresolved
featureless continuum and hot dust component -- as found in Mrk1066 -- are
found for Mrk 1157.

SAGE1CJ053634, an IR point-source detected by Spitzer/SAGE (Meixner et al
2006). The source was observed in the SAGE-Spec program (Kemper et al., 2010)
and was included to determine the nature of sources with deviant IR colours.
The spectrum shows a redshifted (z=0.14+-0.005) silicate emission feature with
an exceptionally high feature-to-continuum ratio and weak polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) bands. We compare the source with models of emission from
dusty tori around AGNs from Nenkova et al. (2008). We present a diagnostic
diagram that will help to identify similar sources based on Spitzer/MIPS and
Herschel/PACS photometry. The SED of SAGE1CJ053634 is peculiar because it lacks
far-IR emission and a clear stellar counterpart. We find that the SED and the
IR spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pc
around an accreting black hole. There is no need to invoke emission from the
host galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although a
possible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the SED analysis.
The hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaks
at 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thin
emission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. The weak PAH
emission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formation
templates strongly over-predict the measured far-IR flux levels. The SED of
SAGE1CJ053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the more
distant universe. The conspicuous absence of host-galaxy IR emission places
limits on the far-IR emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

intelligences (ETIs) because they deliberately prevent us from detecting them.
While a valid solution to Fermi's Paradox, it is not particularly amenable to
rigorous scientific analysis, as it implicitly assumes a great deal about the
sociological structure of a plurality of civilisations. Any attempt to assess
its worth must begin with its most basic assumption - that ETIs share a
uniformity of motive in shielding Earth from extraterrestrial contact. This
motive is often presumed to be generated by the influence of the first
civilisation to arrive in the Galaxy. I show that recent work on inter-arrival
time analysis, while necessary, is insufficient to assess the validity of the
Zoo Hypothesis (and its related variants). The finite speed of light prevents
an early civilisation from exerting immediate cultural influence over a later
civilisation if they are sufficiently distant. I show that if civilisation
arrival times and spatial locations are completely uncorrelated, this strictly
prevents the establishment of total hegemony throughout the Galaxy. I finish by
presenting similar results derived from more realistic Monte Carlo Realisation
simulations (where arrival time and spatial locations are partially
correlated). These also show that total hegemony is typically broken, even when
the total population of civilisations remains low. In the terminology of
previous studies of solutions to Fermi's Paradox, this confirms the Zoo
Hypothesis as a ""soft"" solution. However, an important question to be resolved
by future work is the extent to which many separate hegemonies are established,
and to what extent this affects the Zoo Hypothesis.

The high density phase of this matter in the presence of a magnetic field is
known to be the Magnetic Color-Flavor-Locked (MCFL) phase of color
superconductivity. We derive the Fierz identities of the theory and show how
the explicit breaking of the rotational symmetry by the uniform magnetic field
field opens new channels of interactions and allows the formation of a new
diquark condensate. The new order parameter is a spin-1 diquark condensate
proportional to the component in the field direction of the average magnetic
moment of the pairs of charged quarks. In the region of large fields, the new
condensate's magnitude becomes comparable to the larger of the two scalar gaps.
Since there is no solution of the gap equations with nonzero scalar gaps and
zero value of this magnetic moment condensate, its presence in the MCFL phase
is unavoidable. This is consistent with the fact that the extra condensate does
not break any symmetry that has not already been broken by the known MCFL gaps.
The spin-1 condensate enhances the condensation energy of pairs formed by
charged quarks and the magnetization of the system. We discuss the possible
consequences of the new order parameter on the issue of the chromomagnetic
instability that appears in color superconductivity at moderate density.

this paper we quantitatively investigate the effect of these quasi-periodic
modulations on the convection electric field at Titan. We show that the
electric field can be significantly perturbed away from the nominal radial
orientation inferred from Voyager 1 observations, and demonstrate that upstream
categorisation schemes must be used with care when undertaking quantitative
studies of Titan's magnetospheric interaction, particularly where assumptions
regarding the orientation of the convection electric field are made.

are responsible for at least some of the Sun's hot corona, but whether they are
the explanation for most of the multi-million degree plasma has been a matter
of ongoing debate. We here present evidence that nanoflares are widespread in
an active region observed by the X-Ray Telescope on-board the Hinode mission.
The distributions of intensity fluctuations have small but important
asymmetries, whether taken from individual pixels, multi-pixel subregions, or
the entire active region. Negative fluctuations (corresponding to reduced
intensity) are greater in number but weaker in amplitude, so that the median
fluctuation is negative compared to a mean of zero. Using MonteCarlo
simulations, we show that only part of this asymmetry can be explained by
Poisson photon statistics. The remainder is explainable with a tendency for
exponentially decreasing intensity, such as would be expected from a cooling
plasma produced from a nanoflare. We suggest that nanoflares are a universal
heating process within active regions.

challenges in the field of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is to
understand whether and how the high energy scale physics associated with
Mott-like excitations (|E-E$_{F}$|>1 eV) is involved in the condensate
formation. Here we show the interplay between the many-body high-energy CuO2
excitations at 1.5 and 2 eV and the onset of HTSC. This is revealed by a novel
optical pump supercontinuum-probe technique, which provides access to the
dynamics of the dielectric function in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_{0.92}$Y$_{0.08}$Cu$_2$O$_{8+{\delta}}$ over an extended energy

coupled neurons. The neurons are connected as in a directed Erd\""os-Renyi graph
with average connectivity $<k>$ scaling as a power law with the number of
neurons in the network. The scaling is controlled by a parameter $\gamma$,
which allows to pass from massively connected to sparse networks and therefore
to modify the topology of the system. At a macroscopic level we observe two
distinct dynamical phases: an Asynchronous State (AS) corresponding to a
desynchronized dynamics of the neurons and a Partial Synchronization (PS)
regime associated with a coherent periodic activity of the network. At low
connectivity the system is in an AS, while PS emerges above a certain critical
average connectivity $<k>_c$. For sufficiently large networks, $<k>_c$
saturates to a constant value suggesting that a minimal average connectivity is
sufficient to observe coherent activity in systems of any size irrespectively
of the kind of considered network: sparse or massively connected. However, this
value depends on the nature of the synapses: reliable or unreliable. For
unreliable synapses the critical value required to observe the onset of
macroscopic behaviors is noticeably smaller than for reliable synaptic
transmission. Due to the disorder present in the system, for finite number of
neurons we have inhomogeneities in the neuronal behaviors, inducing a weak form
of chaos, which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. In such a limit the
disordered systems exhibit regular (non chaotic) dynamics and their properties
correspond to that of a homogeneous fully connected network for any
$\gamma$-value. Apart for the peculiar exception of sparse networks, which
remain intrinsically inhomogeneous at any system size.

  2. The author thanks Earl Campbell and Christian Gogolin for pointing out the
  crucial error",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-locality is a powerful resource for various communication and information
theoretic tasks, e.g., to establish a secret key between two parties, or to
reduce the communication complexity of distributed computing. Typically, the
more non-local a system is, the more useful it is as a resource for such tasks.
We address the issue of non-locality distillation, i.e., whether it is possible
to create a strongly non-local system by local operations on several weakly
non-local ones. More specifically, we consider a setting where non-local
systems can be realized via measurements on underlying shared quantum states.
The hardest instances for non-locality distillation are the isotropic quantum
systems: if a certain isotropic system can be distilled, then all systems of
the same non-locality can be distilled as well. The main result of this paper
is that non-locality cannot be distilled from such isotropic quantum systems.
Our results are based on the theory of cross norms defined over the tensor
product of certain Banach spaces. In particular, we introduce a
single-parameter family of cross norms, which is used to construct a hierarchy
of convex sets that are closed under local operations. This hierarchy
interpolates between the set of local systems and an approximation to the set
of quantum systems.
