  Linear-Time Codes","73 pages, 28 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of designing network codes that are both
communicationally and computationally efficient over packet line networks with
worst-case schedules is considered. In this context, random linear network
codes (dense codes) are asymptotically capacity-achieving, but require highly
complex coding operations. To reduce the coding complexity, Maymounkov et al.
proposed chunked codes (CC). Chunked codes operate by splitting the message
into non-overlapping chunks and send a randomly chosen chunk at each
transmission time by a dense code. The complexity, that is linear in the chunk
size, is thus reduced compared to dense codes. In this paper, the existing
analysis of CC is revised, and tighter bounds on the performance of CC are
derived. As a result, we prove that (i) CC with sufficiently large chunks are
asymptotically capacity-achieving, but with a slower speed of convergence
compared to dense codes; and (ii) CC with relatively smaller chunks approach
the capacity with an arbitrarily small but non-zero constant gap. To improve
the speed of convergence of CC, while maintaining their advantage in reducing
the computational complexity, we propose and analyze a new CC scheme with
overlapping chunks, referred to as overlapped chunked codes (OCC). We prove
that for smaller chunks, which are advantageous due to lower computational
complexity, OCC with larger overlaps provide a better tradeoff between the
speed of convergence and the message or packet error rate. This implies that
for smaller chunks, and with the same computational complexity, OCC outperform
CC in terms of the speed of approaching the capacity for sufficiently small
target error rate. In fact, we design linear-time OCC with very small chunks
(constant in the message size) that are both computationally and
communicationally efficient, and that outperform linear-time CC.

  Learning of Affine Subspaces",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is now practically the norm for data to be very high dimensional in areas
such as genetics, machine vision, image analysis and many others. When
analyzing such data, parametric models are often too inflexible while
nonparametric procedures tend to be non-robust because of insufficient data on
these high dimensional spaces. It is often the case with high-dimensional data
that most of the variability tends to be along a few directions, or more
generally along a much smaller dimensional submanifold of the data space. In
this article, we propose a class of models that flexibly learn about this
submanifold and its dimension which simultaneously performs dimension
reduction. As a result, density estimation is carried out efficiently. When
performing classification with a large predictor space, our approach allows the
category probabilities to vary nonparametrically with a few features expressed
as linear combinations of the predictors. As opposed to many black-box methods
for dimensionality reduction, the proposed model is appealing in having clearly
interpretable and identifiable parameters. Gibbs sampling methods are developed
for posterior computation, and the methods are illustrated in simulated and

flux threading the cores is dragged into the stars, the stellar field would be
orders of magnitude stronger than observed. This well-known ""magnetic flux
problem"" demands that most of the core magnetic flux be decoupled from the
matter that enters the star. We carry out the first exploration of what happens
to the decoupled magnetic flux in 3D, using an MHD version of the ENZO adaptive
mesh refinement code. The field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sink
particle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phase
of star formation. We find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near the
accreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. The high pressure is
released anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. It drives a
low-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled.
This decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3D MHD
simulations of star formation. It generates a strong asymmetry in the
protostellar accretion flow, potentially giving a kick to the star. In the
presence of an initial core rotation, the structure presents an obstacle to the
formation of a rotationally supported disk, in addition to magnetic braking, by
acting as a rigid magnetic wall that prevents the rotating gas from completing
a full orbit around the central object. We conclude that the decoupled magnetic
flux from the stellar matter can strongly affect the protostellar collapse
dynamics.

suboptimal mixing, and present some simple, inexpensive alternatives that can

bifurcation in a differentially rotating tokamak plasma. Such a bifurcation is
more probable in a region of zero magnetic shear than one of finite magnetic
shear because in the former case the component of the sheared toroidal flow
that is perpendicular to the magnetic field has the strongest suppressing
effect on the turbulence. In the zero-magnetic-shear regime, there are no
growing linear eigenmodes at any finite value of flow shear. However,
subcritical turbulence can be sustained, owing to the transient growth of modes
driven by the ion temperature gradient (ITG) and the parallel velocity gradient
(PVG). Nonetheless, in a parameter space containing a wide range of temperature
gradients and velocity shears, there is a sizeable window where all turbulence
is suppressed. Combined with the relatively low transport of momentum by
collisional (neoclassical) mechanisms, this produces the conditions for a
bifurcation from low to high temperature and velocity gradients. The path of
this bifurcation is mapped out using interpolation from a large number of
simulations. Numerical simulations are also used to construct a parametric
model which accurately describes the combined effect of the temperature
gradient and the flow gradient over a wide range of their values. Using this
parametric model, it is shown that in this reduced-transport state, heat is
transported almost neoclassically, while momentum transport is dominated by
subcritical PVG turbulence. It is further shown that for any given input of
torque, there is an optimum input of heat which maximises the temperature
gradient. The parametric model describes both the behaviour of the subcritical
turbulence and the complicated effect of the flow shear on the transport
stiffness. It may prove useful for transport modelling of tokamaks with sheared
flows.

magneto-acoustic waves near their reflection level in the solar atmosphere,
with implications both for coronal oscillations and for active region
helio-seismology. In active regions this reflection typically occurs high
enough that the Alfv\'en speed $a$ greatly exceeds the sound speed $c$, well
above the $a=c$ level where the fast and slow modes interact. In order to focus
on the fundamental characteristics of fast/Alfv\'en conversion, stripped of
unnecessary detail, it is therefore useful to freeze out the slow mode by
adopting the gravitationally stratified cold MHD model $c\to0$. This provides a
benchmark for fast-to-Alfv\'en mode conversion in more complex atmospheres.
Assuming a uniform inclined magnetic field and an exponential Alfv\'en speed
profile with density scale height $h$, the Alfv\'en conversion coefficient
depends on three variables only; the dimensionless
transverse-to-the-stratification wavenumber $\kappa=kh$, the magnetic field
inclination from the stratification direction $\theta$, and the polarization
angle $\phi$ of the wavevector relative to the plane containing the
stratification and magnetic field directions. We present an extensive
exploration of mode conversion in this parameter space and conclude that
near-total conversion to outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves typically occurs
for small $\theta$ and large $\phi$ ($80^\circ$--$90^\circ$), though it is
absent entirely when $\theta$ is exactly zero (vertical field). For wavenumbers
of helioseismic interest, the conversion region is broad enough to encompass
the whole chromosphere.

memoryless channel, an encoder, which encodes the source symbols sequentially
with knowledge of future source symbols upto a fixed finite lookahead, d, with
or without feedback of the past channel output symbols and a decoder, which
sequentially constructs the source symbols using the channel output. The
objective is to minimize the expected per-symbol distortion. For a fixed finite
lookahead d>=1 we invoke the theory of controlled markov chains to obtain an
average cost optimality equation (ACOE), the solution of which, denoted by
D(d), is the minimum expected per-symbol distortion. With increasing d, D(d)
bridges the gap between causal encoding, d=0, where symbol by symbol
encoding-decoding is optimal and the infinite lookahead case, d=\infty, where
Shannon Theoretic arguments show that separation is optimal. We extend the
analysis to a system with finite state decoders, with or without noise-free
feedback. For a Bernoulli source and binary symmetric channel, under hamming
loss, we compute the optimal distortion for various source and channel
parameters, and thus obtain computable bounds on D(d). We also identify regions
of source and channel parameters where symbol by symbol encoding-decoding is
suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our approach by
applying it in additional coding scenarios, such as the case where the
sequential decoder can take cost constrained actions affecting the quality or
availability of side information about the source.

region among a paramagnetic metal, band insulator, and Mott insulator. The
underlying mechanism is nesting instability of the Fermi surface by a

regions that regulate gene transcription. Expression QTL is used to study the
regulatory structure of normal tissues and to search for genetic factors in
complex diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. A modern eQTL
dataset contains millions of SNPs and thousands of transcripts measured for
hundreds of samples. This makes the analysis computationally complex as it
involves independent testing for association for every transcript-SNP pair. The
heavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular, often forces
analysts to restrict their attention to just a subset of transcripts and SNPs.
As larger genotype and gene expression datasets become available, the demand
for fast tools for eQTL analysis increases. We present a new method for fast
eQTL analysis via linear models, called Matrix eQTL. Matrix eQTL can model and
test for association using both linear regression and ANOVA models. The models
can include covariates to account for such factors as population structure,
gender, and clinical variables. It also supports testing of heteroscedastic
models and models with correlated errors. In our experiment on large datasets
Matrix eQTL was thousands of times faster than the existing popular software
for QTL/eQTL analysis. Matrix eQTL is implemented as both Matlab and R packages
and thus can easily be run on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems. The software

one-component Gaussian core model (GCM) at high densities. The nucleation rate
at a fixed supersaturation is found to decrease as the density increases. At
very high densities, the nucleation is not observed at all in the time window
accessed by long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Concomitantly, the system
exhibits typical slow dynamics of the supercooled fluids near the glass
transition point. We compare the simulation results of the supercooled GCM with
the predictions of mode-coupling theory (MCT) and find that the agreement
between them is better than any other model glassformers studied numerically in
the past. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation
is weaker and the non-Gaussian parameter is smaller than canonical
glassformers. Analysis of the probability distribution of the particle
displacement clearly reveals that the hopping effect is strongly suppressed in
the high density GCM. We conclude from these observations that the GCM is more
amenable to the mean-field picture of the glass transition than other models.
This is attributed to the long-ranged nature of the interaction potential of
the GCM in the high density regime. Finally, the intermediate scattering
function at small wavevectors is found to decay much faster than its self part,
indicating that dynamics of the large-scale density fluctuations decouples with
the shorter-ranged caging motion.

usually entails quantizing a source that lives on the Grassmann manifold. Most
work on limited feedback beamforming considered single-shot quantization. In
wireless systems, however, the channel is temporally correlated, which can be
used to reduce feedback requirements. Unfortunately, conventional predictive
quantization does not incorporate the non-Euclidean structure of the Grassmann

where the differential geometric structure of the Grassmann manifold is used to
formulate a predictive vector quantization encoder and decoder. We analyze the
quantization error and derive bounds on the distortion attained by the proposed
algorithm. We apply the algorithm to a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output

synchronizes to a time-dependent state [Atay et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,
144101 (2004)], which may be periodic or chaotic depending on the delay; when
the delays are sufficiently heterogeneous, the synchronization proceeds to a
steady-state, which is unstable for the uncoupled map [Masoller and Marti,

time-dependent to steady-state synchronization as the width of the delay
distribution increases. We also compare the two transitions to synchronization
as the coupling strength increases. We use transition probabilities calculated
via symbolic analysis and ordinal patterns. We find that, as the coupling
strength increases, before the onset of steady-state synchronization the
network splits into two clusters which are in anti-phase relation with each
other. On the other hand, with increasing delay heterogeneity, no cluster
formation is seen at the onset of steady-state synchronization; however, a
rather complex unsynchronized state is detected, revealed by a diversity of
transition probabilities in the network nodes.

potential to fulfil this demand. Here, we report on the fabrication and

along the Hubble sequence. Not only the disk undergoes morphological and
kinematic changes, but also a preexisting classical bulge may be dynamically
changed by the secular processes driven primarily by the bar. We study the
influence of a growing bar on the dynamical evolution of a low mass classical
bulge such as might be present in galaxies like the Milky Way. Using
self-consistent high resolution {\it N}-body simulations, we study how an
initially isotropic non-rotating small classical bulge absorbs angular momentum
emitted by the bar. The basic mechanism of this angular momentum exchange is
through resonances and a considerable fraction of the angular momentum is
channeled through Lagrange point (-1:1) and ILR (2:1) orbits. In the phase of
rapid dynamical growth, also retrograde non-resonant orbits absorb significant
angular momentum. As a result of this angular momentum gain, the initially
non-rotating classical bulge transforms into a fast rotating, radially
anisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the similarly fast rotating boxy
bulge formed from the disk. Towards the end of the evolution, the classical
bulge develops cylindrical rotation. By that time, its inner regions host a
""classical bulge-bar"" whose distinct kinematics could serve as direct
observational evidence for the secular evolution in the galaxy. Some
implications of these results are discussed briefly.

maximum SSP step size for methods that include negative coefficients and
downwind-biased semi-discretizations. We prove that the downwind SSP
coefficient for linear multistep methods of order greater than one is at most
equal to two, while the downwind SSP coefficient for explicit Runge--Kutta
methods is at most equal to the number of stages of the method. In contrast,
the maximal downwind SSP coefficient for second order Runge--Kutta methods is

magnetoresistance (MR) of La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) thin films (0.10 < x < 0.25).
These two observables are promising for the detection of stripes. Subtle
features of the conductance anisotropy are revealed by measuring the transverse
resistance Rxy in zero magnetic field. It is demonstrated that the sign of Rxy
depends on the orientation of the LSCO Hall bar with respect to the terrace
structure of the substrate. Unit-cell-high substrate step edges must therefore
be a dominant nucleation source for antiphase boundaries during film growth. We
show that the measurement of Rxy is sensitive enough to detect the
cubic-tetragonal phase transition of the SrTiO3(100) (STO) substrate at 105 K.
The MR of LSCO thin films shows for 0.10 < x < 0.25 a non-monotonic temperature
dependence, resulting from the onset of a linear term in the MR above 90 K. We
show that the linear MR scales with the absolute Hall resistivity, with the
constant of proportionality independent of temperature. Such scaling suggests
that the linear MR originates from current distortions induced by structural or
electronic inhomogeneities. The possible role of stripes for both the MR and
the conductance anisotropy is discussed throughout the paper.
