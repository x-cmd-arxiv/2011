pQCD predictions. The presence of a hot medium (a Quark Gluon Plasma described
by hydrodynamics) affects the final spectra of open-charm (beauty) hadrons and
their decay electrons with respect to what found in pp collisions. The
propagation of c and b quarks in the plasma is based on a picture of multiple
uncorrelated random collisions, described by a relativistic Langevin equation.
A microscopic evaluation of the transport coefficients is provided within a
pQCD approach (with proper resummation of medium effects). Results for the
final spectra of heavy-flavor hadrons and decay-electrons are given, with

function P(h) of the T=0 SK-model as the difference between a split Gaussian
and the first excited state $\psi_1$ of a weakly anharmonic oscillator with
nonanalytic shift by means of the analogy $P(h)<->|\psi_1(x)|$. New numerical
calculations of the leading 100 orders of replica symmetry breaking (RSB) were
performed in order to obtain P(h), employing the exact mapping between density
of states $\rho(E)$ of the fermionic SK-model and P(h) of the standard model,
as derived by Perez-Castillo and Sherrington. Fast convergence towards a fixed
point function $\rho(E)$ for infinite steps of RSB is observed. A surprisingly
small number of harmonic oscillator wave-functions suffices to represent this
fixed point function. This allows to determine an anharmonic potential V(x)
with nonanalytic shift, whose first excited state represents $\rho(E)$ and
hence P(h). The harmonic potential with unconventional shift $V_2(x)\sim
(|x|-x_0)^2=(x-x_0\,sign(x))^2$ yields already a very good approximation, since
anharmonic couplings of $V(x)-V_2(x)\sim |x|^{m}, m>2,$ decay rapidly with
increasing m. We compare the pseudogap-forming effect of replica symmetry
breaking, hosted by the fermionic SK-model, with the analogous effect in the

asynchrony between signals transmitted by multiple transmitters. That is,
symbols transmitted by different transmitters could arrive at the receiver with
symbol misalignment as well as relative carrier-phase offset. A second
important issue is how to integrate channel coding with PNC to achieve reliable
communication. This paper investigates these two issues and makes the following
contributions: 1) We propose and investigate a general framework for decoding
at the receiver based on belief propagation (BP). The framework can effectively
deal with symbol and phase asynchronies while incorporating channel coding at
the same time. 2) For unchannel-coded PNC, we show that for BPSK and QPSK
modulations, our BP method can significantly reduce the asynchrony penalties
compared with prior methods. 3) For unchannel-coded PNC, with half symbol
offset between the transmitters, our BP method can drastically reduce the
performance penalty due to phase asynchrony, from more than 6 dB to no more
than 1 dB. 4) For channel-coded PNC, with our BP method, both symbol and phase
asynchronies actually improve the system performance compared with the
perfectly synchronous case. Furthermore, the performance spread due to
different combinations of symbol and phase offsets between the transmitters in
channel-coded PNC is only around 1 dB. The implication of 3) is that if we
could control the symbol arrival times at the receiver, it would be
advantageous to deliberately introduce a half symbol offset in unchannel-coded
PNC. The implication of 4) is that when channel coding is used, symbol and
phase asynchronies are not major performance concerns in PNC.

a Mott insulator subject to a strong laser or a static electric field is
studied in the one-dimensional Hubbard model. Two nonlinear effects cause the
excitation, i.e., multi-photon absorption and quantum tunneling. Keldysh
crossover between the two mechanisms occurs as the field strength and photon
energy is changed. The calculation is done analytically by the Landau-Dykhne
method in combination with the Bethe ansatz solution and the results are
compared with those of the time dependent density matrix renormalization group.
Using this method, we calculate distribution function of the generated
doublon-hole pairs and show that it drastically changes as we cross the Keldysh
crossover line. After calculating the tunneling threshold for several
representative one-dimensional Mott insulators, possible experimental tests of
the theory is proposed such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the
upper Hubbard band in the quantum tunneling regime. We also discuss the
relation of the present theory with a many-body extension of electron-positron
pair production in nonlinear quantum electrodynamics known as the Schwinger
mechanism.

lymphocyte expansion/suppression (e.g. lymphoproliferative syndromes),
subpopulation unbalance (e.g. HIV, EBV infections) and ageing (thought of as
noise growth); the correlation of such states to auto-immune diseases is also

substantial couplings to a pair of light quarks or to one light and one heavy

of the examples being the interaction of the low-frequency dynamics in the
atmosphere with the fast turbulent weather dynamics. One of the key questions
about chaotic multiscale systems is how the fast dynamics affects chaos at the
slow variables, and, therefore, impacts uncertainty and predictability of the
slow dynamics. Here we demonstrate that the linear slow-fast coupling with the
total energy conservation property promotes the suppression of chaos at the
slow variables through the rapid mixing at the fast variables, both
theoretically and through numerical simulations. A suitable mathematical
framework is developed, connecting the slow dynamics on the tangent subspaces
to the infinite-time linear response of the mean state to a constant external
forcing at the fast variables. Additionally, it is shown that the uncoupled
dynamics for the slow variables may remain chaotic while the complete
multiscale system loses chaos and becomes completely predictable at the slow
variables through increasing chaos and turbulence at the fast variables. This
result contradicts the common sense intuition, where, naturally, one would
think that coupling a slow weakly chaotic system with another much faster and
much stronger mixing system would result in general increase of chaos at the
slow variables.

Furthermore, these types of processes are typically multivariate and only
adequately described by complex nonlinear relationships involving externally
measured covariates. Ignoring these aspects of the data and implementing
standard approaches can lead to models that fail to provide adequate scientific
understanding of the underlying ecological processes, possibly resulting in a
loss of inferential power. One method of dealing with data having excess zeros
is to consider the class of univariate zero-inflated generalized linear models.
However, this class of models fails to address the multivariate and nonlinear
aspects associated with the data usually encountered in practice. Therefore, we
propose a semiparametric bivariate zero-inflated Poisson model that takes into
account both of these data attributes. The general modeling framework is
hierarchical Bayes and is suitable for a broad range of applications. We

(BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) may be directly detected, making a thorough
theoretical understanding of these systems a high priority. As an additional
motivation, these systems may represent a subset of short-duration gamma-ray
burst (sGRB) progenitors. BH-NS mergers are expected to result from primordial,
quasi-circular inspiral as well as dynamically formed capture binaries. The
latter channel allows mergers with high eccentricity, resulting in a richer
variety of outcomes. We perform general relativistic simulations of BH-NS
interactions with a range of impact parameters, and find significant variation
in the properties of these events that have potentially observable
consequences, namely the GW signature, remnant accretion disk mass, and amount
of unbound material.

homotopy category of $k$-linear dg-categories, between dg-categories of
equivariant factorizations. This motivates a notion, similar to that of
Kuznetsov, which we call the extended Hochschild cohomology algebra of the
category of equivariant factorizations. In some cases of geometric interest,
extended Hochschild cohomology contains Hochschild cohomology as a subalgebra
and Hochschild homology as a homogeneous component. We use our factorization
model for the internal Hom to calculate the extended Hochschild cohomology for
equivariant factorizations on affine space.
  Combining the computation of extended Hochschild cohomology with the
Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism and a theorem of Orlov recovers and
extends Griffiths' classical description of the primitive cohomology of a
smooth, complex projective hypersurface in terms of homogeneous pieces of the
Jacobian algebra. In the process, the primitive cohomology is identified with
the fixed subspace of the cohomological endomorphism associated to an
interesting endofunctor of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on
the hypersurface. We also demonstrate how to understand the whole Jacobian
algebra as morphisms between kernels of endofunctors of the derived category.
  Finally, we present a bootstrap method for producing algebraic cycles in
categories of equivariant factorizations. As proof of concept, we show how this
reproves the Hodge conjecture for all self-products of a particular K3 surface
closely related to the Fermat cubic fourfold.

data consist of 790 square degrees of sky observed at 150 GHz during 2008 and
2009. Here we present the power spectrum over the multipole range 650 < ell <
3000, where it is dominated by primary CMB anisotropy. We combine this power
spectrum with the power spectra from the seven-year Wilkinson Microwave

0.0112. We detect, at ~5-sigma significance, the effect of gravitational
lensing on the CMB power spectrum, and find its amplitude to be consistent with
the LCDM cosmological model. We explore a number of extensions beyond the LCDM
model. Each extension is tested independently, although there are degeneracies
between some of the extension parameters. We constrain the tensor-to-scalar
ratio to be r < 0.21 (95% CL) and constrain the running of the scalar spectral

Timing Explorer (RXTE). The pulsar's spin-down rate implies a rotation-powered
luminosity Edot = 1.2 x 10^{38} erg/s, a surface dipole magnetic field strength
B_s = 1.0 x 10^{12} G, and a characteristic age of 8.9 kyr. PSR J2022+3842 is
thus the second-most energetic Galactic pulsar known, after the Crab, as well
as the most rapidly-rotating young, radio-bright pulsar known. The radio
pulsations are highly dispersed and broadened by interstellar scattering, and
we find that a large (delta-f / f ~= 1.9 x 10^{-6}) spin glitch must have
occurred between our discovery and confirmation observations. The X-ray pulses
are narrow (0.06 cycles FWHM) and visible up to 20 keV, consistent with
magnetospheric emission from a rotation-powered pulsar. The Chandra X-ray image
identifies the pulsar with a hard, unresolved source at the midpoint of the
double-lobed radio morphology of SNR G76.9+1.0 and embedded within faint,
compact X-ray nebulosity. The spatial relationship of the X-ray and radio
emissions is remarkably similar to extended structure seen around the Vela

absorbed power-law model with column density N_H = (1.7\pm0.3) x 10^{22}

luminosity of PSR J2022+3842 is L_X(2-10 keV) = 7.0 x 10^{33} erg s^{-1}.
Despite being extraordinarily energetic, PSR J2022+3842 lacks a bright X-ray

provide significant lensing signals and are well detected in their
reconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. Combining the current results and our
previous weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we compare
gravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. We
revisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in our
sample is in tension with the current LambdaCDM structure formation paradigm.
We find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gas
temperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperature
relation at z >~ 1. For the power law slope of the M-TX relation (M propto
T^{\alpha}), we obtain \alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. This is consistent with the
theoretical self-similar prediction \alpha=3/2 and with the results previously
reported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. However, our
normalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that the
normalization in the M-TX relation might evolve. After correcting for Eddington
bias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we find
that the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides a
tension with the current Lambda CDM model. The combined probability of finding
the four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization over

characterizing how frequent habitable worlds and life may be within the Galaxy.
Whilst much effort has been spent on searching for Earth-like planets, large
moons may also be common, temperate abodes for life as well. The methods to
detect extrasolar moons, or ""exomoons"" are more subtle than their planetary
counterparts and in this thesis I aim to provide a method to find such bodies
in transiting systems, which offer the greatest potential for detection. Before
one can search for the tiny perturbations to the planetary signal, an
understanding of the planetary transit must be established. Therefore, in
Chapters 3 to 5 I discuss the transit model and provide several new insights.
Chapter 4 presents new analytic expressions for the times of transit minima and
the transit duration, which will be critical in the later search for exomoons.
Chapter 5 discusses two sources of distortion to the transit signal, namely
blending (with a focus on the previously unconsidered self-blending scenario)
and light curve smearing due to long integration times. I provide methods to
compensate for both of these effects, thus permitting for the accurate
modelling of the planetary transit light curve. In Chapter 6, I discuss methods
to detect exomoons through their gravitational influence on the host planet,
giving rise to transit timing and duration variations (TTV and TDV). The
previously known TTV effect is updated with a new model and the associated
critical problems are outlined. I then predict a new effect, TDV, which solves
these problems, making exomoon detection viable. Chapter 7 presents a
feasibility study for detecting habitable-zone exomoons with Kepler, where it
is found that moons down to 0.2 Earth masses are detectable. Finally,
conclusions and future work are discussed in Chapter 8.

the absence of the baryon and lepton number violating interactions of dimension

decays of the right-handed neutrinos and baryon number violating signals from
the decays of squarks and gauginos without conflict with the bounds coming from
proton decay, n-nbar oscillations and dinucleon decays.

characterized by their masses and spins and are described by the Kerr metric.
Several parametric deviations from the Kerr metric have been suggested to study
observational signatures in both the electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
spectra that differ from the expected Kerr signals. Due to the no-hair theorem,
however, such spacetimes cannot be regular everywhere outside the event
horizons, if they are solutions to the Einstein field equations; they are often
characterized by naked singularities or closed time-like loops in the regions
of the spacetime that are accessible to an external observer. For observational
tests of the no-hair theorem that involve phenomena in the vicinity of the
circular photon orbit or the innermost stable circular orbit around a black
hole, these pathologies limit the applicability of the metrics only to compact
objects that do not spin rapidly. In this paper, we construct a Kerr-like
metric which depends on a set of free parameters in addition to its mass and
spin and which is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon. We derive
expressions for the energy and angular momentum of a particle on a circular
equatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the locations of the
innermost stable circular orbit and the circular photon orbit. We demonstrate
that these orbits change significantly for even moderate deviations from the
Kerr metric. The properties of our metric make it an ideally suited spacetime
to carry out strong-field tests of the no-hair theorem in the electromagnetic
spectrum using the properties of accretion flows around astrophysical black
holes of arbitrary spin.

  We have confirmed our previous result (Knigge, Leigh & Sills 2009) that there
is a clear, but sub-linear, correlation between the number of blue stragglers
found in the cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it. By
considering a larger spatial extent than just the core, our results suggest
that mass segregation is not the dominant effect contributing to the observed
sub-linearity. We also investigate the radial distributions of the different
stellar populations in our sample of clusters. Our results are consistent with
a linear relationship between the number of stars in these populations and the
total mass enclosed within the same radius. Therefore, we conclude that the
cluster dynamics does not significantly affect the relative distributions of
these populations in our sample.

successfully distinguishes between star formation and AGN emission. The MEx
classification scheme relies on a novel probabilistic approach splitting
galaxies into sub-categories with more confidence than alternative high-z
diagnostic diagrams. It recognizes that galaxies near empirical boundaries on
traditional diagrams have an uncertain classification and thus a non-zero
probability of belonging to more than one category. An outcome of this work is
a system of statistical weights that can be used to compute global properties
of galaxy samples. We apply the MEx diagram to 2,812 galaxies at 0.3<z<1 in the
Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North and Extended Groth Strip fields,
and compare it to an independent X-ray classification scheme. We identify
Compton-thick AGN candidates with large X-ray absorption, which we infer from
the luminosity ratio between hard X-ray emission and [OIII]5007, a nearly
isotropic tracer of AGN. X-ray stacking of sources that were not detected
individually supports the validity of the MEx diagram and yields a very flat
spectral slope for the Compton-thick candidates (Gamma~0.4, unambiguously
indicating absorbed AGN). We present evidence that composite galaxies, which
are difficult to identify with alternative high-redshift diagrams, host the
majority of the highly-absorbed AGN. Our findings suggest that the interstellar
medium of the host galaxy provides significant absorption in addition to the
torus invoked in AGN unified models.

properties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission is
associated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nuclei
within galaxies in the clusters themselves. The excess reaches a maximum at a
radius of ~0.8 Mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 S_250um>34 mJy sources on average

far-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to AGN) then
this corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 M_sun/yr per cluster

effects likely dominate for low mass stars, high mass and Population III stars

the central object from spinning up to more than half of its breakup velocity,
because higher rotation rates lead to bar-like deformations that enable
efficient angular momentum transfer to the surrounding medium. We also find
that the long-term spin evolution of the central object is dictated by the
properties of the surrounding disc. In particular, spiral modes with azimuthal
wavenumber $m=2$ couple more effectively to its spin than the lopsided $m=1$
mode, which was found to inhibit spin evolution. We suggest that even in the
absence of magnetic fields, gravitational torques may provide an upper limit on

G353.6-0.7, in spatial coincidence with the unidentified TeV source HESS
J1731-347 has motivated further observations of the source with the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Cherenkov telescope array to test a possible
association of the gamma-ray emission with the SNR. With a total of 59 hours of
observation, representing about four times the initial exposure available in
the discovery paper of HESS J1731-347, the gamma-ray morphology is investigated
and compared with the radio morphology. An estimate of the distance is derived
by comparing the interstellar absorption derived from X-rays and the one
obtained from 12CO and HI observations. The deeper gamma-ray observation of the
source has revealed a large shell-type structure with similar position and
extension (r~0.25{\deg}) as the radio SNR, thus confirming their association.
By accounting for the H.E.S.S. angular resolution and projection effects within
a simple shell model, the radial profile is compatible with a thin, spatially
unresolved, rim. Together with RX J1713.7-3946, RX J0852.0-4622 and SN 1006,
HESS J1731-347 is now the fourth SNR with a significant shell morphology at TeV
energies. The derived lower limit on the distance of the SNR of 3.2 kpc is used
together with radio and X-ray data to discuss the possible origin of the
gamma-ray emission, either via inverse Compton scattering of electrons or the
decay of neutral pions resulting from proton-proton interaction.

which reionized the universe, an additional source of ionizing photons that
must also contribute to reionization in this scenario is the supernovae (SNe)
which mark the end of the life of massive stars. Here we estimate the relative
contributions of SNe and stars to reionization. While the rate at which
ionizing photons are produced in SN shocks is well below that at which they are
produced by stars, the harder spectra of radiation emitted from SNe leads to an
enhanced escape fraction of SN generated photons relative to that of stellar
photons. In particular, along a given line of sight out of a galaxy, we find
that for neutral hydrogen column densities N_H >~10^18 cm^-2 the contribution
to reionization from SNe is greater than that from stars. Drawing on the
results of simulations presented in the literature, we find that the overall
(line of sight-averaged) SNe shock-generated ionizing photon escape fraction is
larger than the stellar photon escape fraction by a factor of \simeq 4 to
\simeq 7, depending on the metallicity of the stellar population. Overall, our
results suggest that the effect of SNe is an enhancement of up to ~ 10 percent
in the fraction of hydrogen reionized by stellar sources. We briefly discuss
the implications of our results for the population of galaxies responsible for
reionization.

1644+57) that was initially identified as a long-duration gamma-ray burst

a luminosity comparable to its peak value. The astrometric coincidence of the
source with the center of its host galaxy, together with other considerations,
motivated the interpretation that Sw 1644+57 was produced by an outburst from a
10^{6-7} M_sun black hole at the center of the galaxy. Here we consider the
alternate possibility that Sw 1644+57 is indeed a long-duration GRB, albeit a
particularly long one. We discuss the general properties of very long-duration,
low-power GRB-like transients associated with the core-collapse of a massive
star. Both neutron star (magnetar) spindown and black hole accretion can power
such events. The requirements for producing low-power, very long-duration GRBs
by magnetar spindown are similar to those for powering extremely luminous
supernovae by magnetar spindown, suggesting a possible connection between these
two unusual types of transients. Alternatively, Sw 1644+57 be associated with
the faintest core-collapse explosions: the collapse of a rotating red
supergiant in a nominally failed supernova can power accretion onto a
solar-mass black hole for up to ~ 100 days; the jet produced by black hole
accretion inevitably unbinds the outer envelope of the progenitor, leading to a
weak ~ 10^{49} erg explosion. In both neutron star and black hole models, a jet
can burrow through the host star in a few days, with a kinetic luminosity ~
10^{45-46} ergs/s, sufficient to power the observed emission of Sw 1644+57.

luminosity, radio luminosity, and black hole mass for hard state Galactic black
holes and their supermassive analogs. The fundamental plane suggests that, at
low-accretion rates, the physical processes regulating the conversion of an
accretion flow into radiative energy could be universal across the entire black
hole mass scale. However, there is still a need to further refine the
fundamental plane in order to better discern the radiative processes and their
geometry very close to the black hole, in particular the source of hard X-rays.
Further refinement is necessary because error bars on the best-fit slopes of
the fundamental plane are generally large, and also the inferred coefficients
can be sensitive to the adopted sample of black holes. In this work, we regress
the fundamental plane with a Bayesian technique. Our approach shows that
sub-Eddington black holes emit X-ray emission that is predominantly optically
thin synchrotron radiation from the jet, provided that their radio spectra are
flat or inverted. X-ray emission dominated by very radiatively inefficient
accretion flows are excluded at the >3\sigma\ level. We also show that it is
difficult to place FR I galaxies onto the fundamental plane because their X-ray
jet emission is highly affected by synchrotron cooling. On the other hand, BL
Lac objects fit onto the fundamental plane. Including a uniform subset of
high-energy peaked BL Lac objects from the SDSS, we find sub-Eddington black
holes with flat/inverted radio spectra follow log L_x=(1.45\pm0.04)log
L_R-(0.88\pm0.06)\logM_{BH}-6.07\pm1.10, with \sigma_{int}=0.07\pm0.05 dex.
Finally, we discuss how the effects of synchrotron cooling of jet emission from
the highest black hole masses can bias fundamental plane regressions, perhaps
leading to incorrect inferences on X-ray radiation mechanisms.

meta-field theory, that is, a non-quantized but consistent representation of
supergravity, the supersymmetry between gravitons and gravitinos. The
introduction of meta-fields furnishes an independent framework for the study of
gravity despite of constraints of quantization, treating the supersymmetric
partners as deterministic actors of gravitation and not simply probabilistic

not quantizable in the same foot as the other fields, what does not means that
we can not understand gravity by similar formal veins. Also, present work
proposes the implementation of the so-called SCYL program (Supersymmetric
Cosmology at Yonder Locals), an attempt to apply supergravity as a meta-field
theory to solve problems on astrophysical cosmology. The SCYL program is an
effort directed to search convergence between the knowledge brought by
cosmology and by supersymmetry to attain more clearness about the structure and

the background pixels, finding the center and radius of the galaxy, generating
the radial intensity plot, and then computing the slopes of the peaks detected
in the radial intensity plot to measure the spirality of the galaxy and
determine its morphological class. Unlike algorithms that are based on machine
learning, Ganalyzer is based on measuring the spirality of the galaxy, a task
that is difficult to perform manually, and in many cases can provide a more
accurate analysis compared to manual observation. Ganalyzer is simple to use,
and can be easily embedded into other image analysis applications. Another
advantage is its speed, which allows it to analyze ~10,000,000 galaxy images in
five days using a standard modern desktop computer. These capabilities can make
Ganalyzer a useful tool in analyzing large datasets of galaxy images collected

bounce configurations. The scaling of the bounce action with respect to the
most relevant dimensionless couplings and ratios of scales is analyzed. In the
case of the decays towards the susy vacua generated by nonperturbative effects,
the results confirm previous analytical estimations of this scaling, obtained
by assuming a triangular potential barrier. The decay rates towards susy vacua
generated by R-symmetry breaking interactions turn out to be more than
sufficiently suppressed for the phenomenologically relevant parameter range,
and their behavior in this regime differs from analytic estimations valid for
parametrically small scale ratios. It is also shown that in models with
spectator fields, even though the decays towards vacua involving nonzero
spectator VEVs don't have a strong parametric dependence on the scale ratios,
the ISS vacuum can still be made long-lived in the presence of R-symmetry
breaking interactions.

three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with N = 6 supersymmetry and conjectured
that in a certain limit, this theory is dual to type IIA string theory on
AdS4xCP3. Since then, a great deal of evidence has been accumulated which
suggests that the ABJM theory is integrable in the planar limit. Integrability
is a very useful property that allows many physical observables, such as
anomalous dimensions and scattering amplitudes, to be computed efficiently. In
the first half of this thesis, we will explain how to use integrabilty to
compute the anomalous dimensions of long, single-trace operators in the ABJM
theory. In particular, we will describe how to compute them at weak coupling
using a Bethe Ansatz, and how to compute them at strong coupling using string
theory. The latter approach involves using algebraic curve and world-sheet
techniques to compute the energies of string states dual to gauge theory
operators. In the second half of this thesis, we will discuss integrability
from the point of view of on-shell scattering amplitudes in the ABJM theory. In
particular, we will describe how to parameterize the amplitudes in terms of
supertwistors and how to relate higher-point tree-level amplitudes to
lower-point tree-level amplitudes using a recursion relation. We will also
explain how this recursion relation can be used to show that all tree-level
amplitudes of the ABJM theory are invariant under dual superconformal symmetry.
This symmetry is hidden from the point of the action and implies that the
theory has Yangian symmetry, which is a key feature of integrability. This
thesis is mainly based on the material in [101], [83], and [84].

that makes it simple for developers to migrate their smartphone applications to

cloud and provides method level computation offloading. Advancing on previous
works, it focuses on the elasticity and scalability of the server side and
enhances the power of mobile cloud computing by parallelizing method execution
using multiple Virtual Machine (VM) images. We evaluate the system using a
range of benchmarks starting from simple micro-benchmarks to more complex
applications. First, we show that the execution time and energy consumption
decrease two orders of magnitude for the N-queens puzzle and one order of
magnitude for a face detection and a virus scan application, using cloud
offloading. We then show that if a task is parallelizable, the user can request
more than one VM to execute it, and these VMs will be provided dynamically. In
fact, by exploiting parallelization, we achieve a greater reduction on the
execution time and energy consumption for the previous applications. Finally,
we use a memory-hungry image combiner tool to demonstrate that applications can
dynamically request VMs with more computational power in order to meet their
computational requirements.

that include a Sommerfeld enhancement (SFE), 2) different representative
benchmark models of supersymmetric DM, and 3) cosmic ray (CR) induced pion
decay. Among all clusters/groups of a flux-limited X-ray sample, we predict
Virgo, Fornax and M49 to be the brightest DM sources and find a particularly
low CR-induced background for Fornax. For a minimum substructure mass given by
the DM free-streaming scale, cluster halos maximize the substructure boost for
which we find a factor above 1000. Since regions around the virial radius
dominate the annihilation flux of substructures, the resulting surface
brightness profiles are almost flat. This makes it very challenging to detect
this flux with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Assuming cold dark
matter with a substructure mass distribution down to an Earth mass and using
extended Fermi upper limits, we rule out the leptophilic models in their
present form in 28 clusters, and limit the boost from SFE in M49 and Fornax to
be < 5. This corresponds to a limit on SFE in the Milky Way of < 3, which is
too small to account for the increasing positron fraction with energy as seen
by PAMELA and challenges the DM interpretation. Alternatively, if SFE is
realized in Nature, this would imply a limiting substructure mass of M_lim >
10^4 M_sol - a problem for structure formation. Using individual cluster
observations, it will be challenging for Fermi to constrain our selection of DM
benchmark models without SFE. The Fermi upper limits are, however, closing in
on our predictions for the CR flux using an analytic model based on
cosmological hydrodynamical cluster simulations. We limit the CR-to-thermal
pressure in nearby bright galaxy clusters of the Fermi sample to < 10% and in
Norma and Coma to < 3%.

energy release in the solar atmosphere. We report a near disk-center jet on
2010 July 20, observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. In this event, the
standard interchange magnetic reconnection between an emerging flux spanning 9
x 10^3 km and ambient open fields is followed by a blowout-like eruption. In
the ""standard"" stage, as the emerging negative element approached the nearby
positive network fields, a jet with a dome-like base in EUV grew for 30 minutes
before the jet spire began to migrate laterally with enhanced flux emergence.
In the ""blowout"" stage, the above converging fields collided and the subsequent
cancellation produced a UV microflare lasting seven minutes, in which the dome
of the jet seemed to be blown out as (1) the spire swung faster and exhibited
an unwinding motion before vanishing, (2) a rising loop and a blob erupted
leaving behind cusped structures, with the blob spiraling outward in
acceleration after the flare maximum, and (3) ejecting material with a
curtain-like structure at chromospheric to transition-region temperatures also
underwent a transverse motion. It is thus suggested that the flare reconnection
rapidly removes the outer fields of the emerging flux to allow its twisted core
field to erupt, a scenario favoring the jet-scale magnetic breakout model as
recently advocated by Moore et al. in 2010.

this equivalence, namely whether classic uniqueness theorems of static black

surfaces or not. Our main theorem states that, under reasonable hypotheses, a
static spacetime satisfying the null energy condition and containing an
asymptotically flat initial data set, possibly with boundary, which possesses a
bounding weakly outer trapped surface is a unique spacetime. A related result
to this theorem was given in arXiv:0711.1299, where we proved that no bounding

nearly-linear running time and easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis
for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we propose new update
rule and label propagation criterion in LPA to improve both its computational
efficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is
optimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm.
This change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks)
the number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our
generalization of the LPA update rule that takes into account, with varying
strength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label.
Experiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks
show that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities
compared to those found by the original LPA. The benefit of considering
positive neighborhood strength is pronounced especially on real-world networks
containing sufficiently large fraction of nodes with high clustering

stability can be guaranteed for smaller prediction horizons via Lyapunov
arguments if more than only the first control is implemented. Since such a
procedure may be harmful in terms of robustness, we derive conditions which
allow to increase the rate at which state measurements are used for feedback
while maintaining stability and desired performance specifications. Our main
contribution consists in developing two algorithms based on the deduced
conditions and a corresponding stability theorem which ensures asymptotic
stability for the MPC closed loop for significantly shorter prediction
horizons.

and sensor can be lost or delayed can be challenging with respect to stability
and performance. One way to overcome the resulting problems is the use of
prediction based compensation schemes. Instead of a single input, a sequence of
(predicted) future controls is submitted and implemented at the actuator. If
suitable, so-called prediction consistent compensation and control schemes,
such as certain predictive control approaches, are used, stability of the
closed loop in the presence of delays and packet losses can be guaranteed. In
this paper, we show that control schemes employing prediction based delay
compensation approaches do posses inherent robustness properties. Specifically,
if the nominal closed loop system without delay compensation is ISS with
respect to perturbation and measurement errors, then the closed loop system
employing prediction based delay compensation techniques is robustly stable. We
analyze the influence of the prediction horizon on the robustness gains and
illustrate the results in simulation.

transfer calculation around point sources within a three-dimensional Cartesian
grid by using the oct-tree structure for the distribution of radiation sources.
In one prescription, distant radiation sources are grouped as a bright extended
source when the group's angular size, $\theta_{\rm s}$, is smaller than a
critical value, $\theta_{\rm crit}$, and radiative transfer is solved on
supermeshes whose angular sizes are similar to that of the group of sources.
The supermesh structure is constructed by coarse-graining the mesh structure.
With this method, the computational time scales with $N_{\rm m} \log(N_{\rm m})
\log(N_{\rm s})$ where $N_{\rm m}$ and $N_{\rm s}$ are the number of meshes and
that of radiation sources, respectively. While this method is very efficient,
it inevitably overestimates the optical depth when a group of sources acts as
an extended powerful radiation source and affects distant meshes. In the other
prescription, a distant group of sources is treated as a bright point source
ignoring the spatial extent of the group and the radiative transfer is solved
on the meshes rather than the supermeshes. This prescription is simply a
grid-based version of {\scriptsize START} by Hasegawa & Umemura and yields
better results in general with slightly more computational cost ($\propto
N_{\rm m}^{4/3} \log(N_{\rm s})$) than the supermesh prescription. Our methods
can easily be implemented to any grid-based hydrodynamic codes and are
well-suited to the adaptive mesh refinement methods.

interact sharing a common working area. In order to avoid collisions, the

e.g., an interacting human, need to be modelled and distinguished from
premodelled objects like workbenches or robots by image processing such as the
background subtraction method.
  The quality of such an approach massively depends on the settings of the

error of the distance using the objects modelled by the background subtraction

This state appears with opening a charge gap between a noncollinear

obstacles that consist of cylindrical columns distributed periodically and
perforated domains with punctured balls. If the decay rate of the capac- ity of
columns or the capacity of punctured ball is too high or too small, the limit
of u\k{o} will converge to trivial solutions. The critical decay rates of
having nontrivial solution are obtained with the construction of barriers. We
also show the limit of u\k{o} satisfies a homogenized equation with a term
showing the effect of the highly oscillating obstacles or perforated domain in
viscosity sense.

years, yielding new approximate filters such as the probability hypothesis
density (PHD), cardinalised PHD (CPHD), and multiple target multi-Bernoulli
(MeMBer). These new methods have largely been based on approximations that
side-step the need for measurement-to-track association. Comparably, RFS
methods that incorporate data association, such as Morelande and Challa's (M-C)
method, have received little attention. This paper provides a RFS algorithm
that incorporates data association similarly to the M-C method, but retains
computational tractability via a recently developed approximation of marginal
association weights. We describe an efficient method for resolving the track
coalescence phenomenon which is problematic for joint probabilistic data
association (JPDA) and related methods (including M-C). The method utilises a
network flow optimisation, and thus is tractable for large numbers of targets.
Finally, our derivation also shows that it is natural for the multi-target
density to incorporate both a Poisson point process (PPP) component
(representing targets that have never been detected) and a multi-Bernoulli
component (representing targets under track). We describe a method of
recycling, in which tracks with a low probability existence are transferred
from the multi-Bernoulli component to the PPP component, effectively yielding a
hybrid of M-C and PHD.

explicitly extremal non-supersymmetric solutions in the cases in which the

  We compare (supersymmetry) Bogomol'nyi bounds with extremality bounds, we
find the first-order flow equations for the non-extremal solutions and the
corresponding superpotential, which gives in the different extremal limits
different superpotentials for extremal black holes. We also compute the

in all cases that their product gives the square of the moduli-independent

With these parameters, we make 17 models and calculate the cloud evolution ~
10^4 years after the protostar formation. We find that early evolution of the
star-disk system can be qualitatively classified into four modes: the massive
disk, early fragmentation, late fragmentation, and protostar dominant modes. In
the 'massive disk mode' to which the majority of models belong, the disk mass
is greater than the protostellar mass for over 10^4 years and no fragmentation
occurs in the circumstellar disk. The collapsing cloud shows fragmentation
before the protostar formation in the 'early fragmentation mode'. The
circumstellar disk shows fragmentation after the protostar formation in the
'late fragmentation mode', in which the secondary star substantially gains its
mass from the circumstellar disk after fragmentation and it has a mass
comparable to that of the primary star. The protostellar mass rapidly increases
and exceeds the circumstellar disk mass in the 'protostar dominant mode'. This
mode appears only when the initial molecular cloud core has a considerably
small rotational energy. Comparison of our results with observations indicates
that a majority of protostar has a fairly massive disk during the main
accretion phase: the circumstellar disk mass is comparable to or more massive
than the protostar. It is expected that such a massive disk promotes gas-giant
formation by gravitational instability in a subsequent evolution stage.

associates to each nonzero $D$-submodule $E$ of $K$, $E^b := \bigcap\{EV \mid V
valuation overring of D\}$, is a semistar operation that plays an important
role in many questions of ring theory (e.g., if $I$ is a nonzero ideal in $D$,
$I^b$ coincides with its integral closure). In a first part of the paper, we
study the integral domains that are $b$-Noetherian (i.e., such that, for each
nonzero ideal $I$ of $D$, $I^b = J^b$ for some a finitely generated ideal $J$
of $D$). For instance, we prove that a $b$-Noetherian domain has Noetherian
spectrum and, if it is integrally closed, is a Mori domain, but integrally
closed Mori domains with Noetherian spectra are not necessarily $b$-Noetherian.
We also characterize several distinguished classes of $b$-Noetherian domains.
In a second part of the paper, we study more generally the e.a.b. semistar
operation of finite type $\star_a$ canonically associated to a given semistar
operation $\star$ (for instance, the $b$-operation is the e.a.b. semistar
operation of finite type canonically associated to the identity operation).
These operations, introduced and studied by Krull, Jaffard, Gilmer and
Halter-Koch, play a very important role in the recent generalizations of the
Kronecker function ring. In particular, in the present paper, we classify
several classes of integral domains having some of the fundamental operations
$d$, $t$, $w$ and $v$ equal to some of the canonically associated e.a.b.
operations $b$, $t_a$, $w_a$ and $v_a$.

concerned: 1) the relative motion of particle in spatial domain; 2) the
particle velocity variations in time domain. The difficulty on treating the
systems is originated from the fact that the motion in time domain and the
motion in spatial domain are coupled together completely. Generally, for a
Hamilton dynamic system established by a set of general velocity functions,
several abstract theories have been well established, such as Lie algebra,
Symplectic manifold, Poisson brackets, and others. However, mathematically, to
find out a general Hamilton function is very difficult even for very simple
problems. Inspired by these abstract mathematic researches, the Hamilton
dynamic system is studied by geometrical field theory of deformation. Firstly,
referring to the instant configuration, the deformation tensor in spatial
domain and the velocity transformation tensor in time domain are established
for a dynamic system defined by a set of general velocity functions. Secondly,
the general deformation tensor in velocity space domain is obtained. From
continuum mechanics point, the stress tensor is defined through introducing
background feature of space. Then, the general motion equations are
established. Based on them, the simple motions are divided into two classes: 1)
stable motion; and 2) radiating motion. Both of them have quantum solution
structures. The features of space-time continuum are studied to obtain some
intrinsic understanding about basic physical facts. This research shows an
engineering way to treat the Hamilton dynamic system.

parameters defining the signal can be stably determined from the samples, a
condition that lies at the heart of every sampling theorem. Consequently, our
analysis subsumes previously studied nonlinear acquisition devices and
nonlinear signal classes. In particular, we do not restrict attention to
memoryless nonlinear distortions or to union-of-subspace models. This allows
treatment of various finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals that were not
previously studied, including, for example, continuous phase modulation
transmissions. Our strategy relies on minimizing the error between the measured
samples and those corresponding to our signal estimate. This least-squares (LS)
objective is generally non-convex and might possess many local minima.
Nevertheless, we prove that under the stability hypothesis, any optimization
method designed to trap a stationary point of the LS criterion necessarily
converges to the true solution. We demonstrate our approach in the context of
recovering pulse streams in settings that were not previously treated.
Furthermore, in situations for which other algorithms are applicable, we show
that our method is often preferable in terms of noise robustness.

We present the first theoretical SN Ia light curves calculated with the

Our goal is to produce light curves and spectra of hydro models of all types of

type Ia supernovae light curves. A simple solver was imple- mented which keeps
track of energy conservation in the atmosphere during the free expansion phase.
Results. The correct operation of the new additions to PHOENIX were verified in
test calculations. Furthermore, we calculated theo- retical light curves and
compared them to the observed SN Ia light curves of SN 1999ee and SN 2002bo. We
obtained LTE as well as NLTE model light curves. Conclusions. We have verified

intended as a tool for the mathematician who studies computability in Analysis.
In a single tape cell a GTM can store a symbol, a real number, a continuous
real function or a probability measure, for example. The model is based on TTE,
the representation approach for computable analysis. As a main result we prove
that the functions that are computable via given representations are closed
under GTM programming. This generalizes the well known fact that these
functions are closed under composition. The theorem allows to speak about
objects themselves instead of names in algorithms and proofs. By using GTMs for
specifying algorithms, many proofs become more rigorous and also simpler and
more transparent since the GTM model is very simple and allows to apply
well-known techniques from Turing machine theory. We also show how finite or
infinite sequences as names can be replaced by sets (generalized
representations) on which computability is already defined via representations.
This allows further simplification of proofs. All of this is done for
multi-functions, which are essential in Computable Analysis, and
multi-representations, which often allow more elegant formulations. As a
byproduct we show that the computable functions on finite and infinite
sequences of symbols are closed under programming with GTMs. We conclude with
examples of application.

TeV blazars, monitored on a total of 116 nights (including 55 nights newly

the INOV characteristics of the two major subclasses of TeV detected BL Lacs,
namely LBLs and HBLs, for which we find the INOV DCs to be ~ 63 % and ~ 38 %,

HBLs persists even when only their TeV detected subsets are considered. Despite
dense sampling, the intranight light curves of the 22 TeV blazars have not
revealed even a single feature on time scale substantially shorter than 1 hour,

intriguing feature, clearly detected in the light curve of the HBL J1555+1111,

paper, we compare the integrated colors of globular clusters in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with those predicted from commonly used simple
stellar population (SSP) models. The colors are based on SDSS observations of
M31's clusters and provide the largest population of star clusters with
accurate photometry available from the survey. As such, it is a unique sample
with which to compare SSP models with SDSS observations. From this work, we
identify a significant offset between the SSP models and the clusters' g-r
colors, with the models predicting colors which are too red by g-r\sim0.1. This
finding is consistent with previous observations of luminous red galaxies in
the SDSS, which show a similar discrepancy. The identification of this offset
in globular clusters suggests that it is very unlikely to be due to a minority
population of young stars. The recently updated SSP model of Maraston &
Stromback better represents the observed g-r colors. This model is based on the
empirical MILES stellar library, rather than theoretical libraries, suggesting

contrast to continuous harmonic functions on graphs and establish deep
connections between standard results in the study of random walks on graphs and

from $O(n^{30})$ to $O(n^{7})$. Proving that the transience class is small
validates the general notion that for most natural phenomenon, the time during
which the system is transient is small. In addition, we use the machinery
developed to prove a number of auxiliary results. We exhibit an equivalence
between two other tessellations of plane, the honeycomb and triangular
lattices. We give general upper bounds on the transience class as a function of
the number of edges to the sink.
  Further, for planar sandpiles we derive an explicit algebraic expression
which provably approximates the transience class of $G$ to within $O(|E(G)|)$.
This expression is based on the spectrum of the Laplacian of the dual of the
graph $G$. We also show a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{3})$ on the transience

qualitative and quantitative agreement with the lattice data. In this paper, we
shall elaborate further on this aspect. First, we shall show that more
dimension 2 condensates can be taken into account than considered so far and,
in addition, we shall give firm evidence that these condensates are in fact
present by discussing the effective potential. It follows thus that the
Gribov-Zwanziger action dynamically transforms itself into the refined version,
thereby showing that the continuum nonperturbative Landau gauge fixing, as
implemented by the Gribov-Zwanziger approach, is consistent with lattice
simulations.

subject of debate. A wide range of masses have been reported in the literature
ranging from as high as 8 M_Earth to as low as 2.3 M_Earth. Although most mass
determinations give a density consistent with a rocky planet, the lower value
permits a bulk composition that can be up to 50% water. We present an analysis
of the CoRoT-7b radial velocity measurements that uses very few and simple
assumptions in treating the activity signal. By only analyzing those radial
velocity data for which multiple measurements were made in a given night we
remove the activity related radial velocity contribution without any a priori
model. We demonstrate that the contribution of activity to the final radial
velocity curve is negligible and that the K-amplitude due to the planet is well
constrained. This yields a mass of 7.42 +/- 1.21 M_Earth and a mean density of
rho = 10.4 +/- 1.8 gm cm^-3. CoRoT-7b is similar in mass and radius to the
second rocky planet to be discovered, Kepler-10b, and within the errors they
have identical bulk densities - they are virtual twins. These bulk densities
lie close to the density - radius relationship for terrestrial planets similar
to what is seen for Mercury. CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b may have an internal
structure more like Mercury than the Earth.

dramatic structures in the local Universe: the Shapley supercluster and the

evolved from an overdense region in the initial Gaussian fluctuation field,
with currently popular choices for the background cosmological model and the
shape and amplitude sigma8 of the initial power spectrum, we estimate that the
total mass of the system is within 20 percent of 1.8 x 10^16 Msun/h. Extreme
value statistics show that the existence of this massive concentration is not
unexpected if the initial fluctuation field was Gaussian, provided there are no
other similar objects within a sphere of radius 200 Mpc/h centred on our
Galaxy. However, a similar analysis of the Sloan Great Wall, a more distant (z
~ 0.08) and extended concentration of structures (volume ~ 7.2 x 10^5
(Mpc/h)^3) suggests that it is more unusual. We estimate its total mass to be
within 20 percent of 1.2 x 10^17 Msun/h; even if it is the densest such object
of its volume within z=0.2, its existence is difficult to reconcile with
Gaussian initial conditions if sigma8 < 0.9. This tension can be alleviated if
this structure is the densest within the Hubble volume. Finally, we show how
extreme value statistics can be used to address the likelihood that an object
like Shapley exists in the same volume which contains the Great Wall, finding,
again, that Shapley is not particularly unusual. It is straightforward to
incorporate other models of the initial fluctuation field into our formalism.

their expansion can be detected within years to decades. The pattern of
expansion probes the internal velocity field and provides clues to the nebula
ejection mechanism. In the case of non-symmetric nebulae, and bipolar nebulae
in particular, it can also provide information on the development of the
morphology. We have measured the expansion proper motions in NGC 6302 from two
epochs of HST imaging, separated by 9.43 years. This is used to determine the
expansion age and the structure of the velocity field. We use HST images in the
[N II] 6583{\AA} filter from HST WF/PC2 and WFC3. The proper motions were
obtained for a set of 200 individual tiles within 90"" of the central star. The
velocity field shows a characteristic linear increase of velocity with radial
distance (a so-called Hubble flow). It agrees well with a previous
determination by Meaburn et al. (2008), made in a lobe further from the star,
which was based on a much longer time span. The pattern of proper motion
vectors is mostly radial and the origin is close to the position of the central
star directly detected by Szyszka et al. (2009). The results show that the
lobes of NGC 6302 were ejected during a brief event 2250 \pm 35yr ago. In the
inner regions there is evidence for a subsequent acceleration of the gas by an
additional 9.2 km/s, possibly related to the onset of ionization. The dense and
massive molecular torus was ejected over 5000yr, ending about 2900yr ago. The
lobes were ejected after a short interlude (the 'jet lag') of \sim 600 yr
during a brief event. The torus and lobes orig- inate from separate mass-loss
events with different physical processes. The delay between the cessation of
equatorial mass loss and the ejection of the lobes provides an important
constraint for explaining the final mass-loss stages of the progenitor stellar
system.

are presented for twelve temperatures (300 -- 1300$^{\circ}$C in 100$^{\circ}$C
intervals and 1370$^{\circ}$C) and each line list covers the 740 -- 2100
cm$^{-1}$ range, which includes the majority of the $\nu_{2}$ umbrella bending
mode region (11 $\mu$m) and the $\nu_{4}$ asymmetric bending mode region (6.2
$\mu$m). We also demonstrate the useful technique of obtaining empirical lower
state energies from a set of spectra recorded at different sample temperatures.
Using our NH$_{3}$ spectra, we have estimated lower state energies ($E_{Low}$
in cm$^{-1}$) and our values have been incorporated into the line lists along
with calibrated wavenumbers ($\tilde{\nu}$ in cm$^{-1}$) and calibrated line
intensities ($S'$ in cm/molecule) for each line. We expect our hot NH$_{3}$
line lists to find direct application in the modelling of planetary atmospheres
and brown dwarfs.

observed as bright patches in the core of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). If, as
generally assumed, this emission is caused by Thomson-scattered light from the
solar surface, it should be strongly polarised tangentially to the solar limb.
However, the observations of a CME made with the SECCHI/STEREO coronagraphs on
31 August 2007 show that the emission from these bright core patches is
exceptionally low polarised. We used the polarisation ratio method of Moran and
Davila (2004) to localise the barycentre of the CME cloud. By analysing the
data from both STEREO spacecraft we could resolve the plane-of-the-sky
ambiguity this method usually suffers from. Stereoscopic triangulation was used
to independently localise the low-polarisation patch relative to the cloud. We
demonstrated for the first time that the bright core material is located close
to the centre of the CME cloud. We show that the major part of the CME core
emission, more than 85% in our case, is H$\alpha$ radiation and only a small
fraction is Thomson-scattered light. Recent calculations also imply that the
plasma density in the patch is 8 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ or more compared to 2.6
10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ for the Thomson-scattering CME environment surrounding the
core material.

astronomy. Namely, I studied the cut-off shape of the Crab pulsar spectrum to
distinguish between the leading scenarios for the pulsar models.
  Pulsars are celestial objects, which emit periodic pulsed electromagnetic
radiation (pulsation) from radio to high energy gamma-rays. Two major scenarios
evolved in past 40 years to explain the pulsation mechanism: the inner
magnetosphere scenario and the outer magnetosphere scenario. Both scenarios
predict a high energy cut-off in the gamma-ray energy spectrum, but with
different cut-off sharpness. An exponential cut-off is expected for the outer
magnetosphere scenario while a super-exponential cut-off is predicted for the
inner magnetosphere scenario. Therefore, one of the best ways to confirm or
rule out these scenarios is to measure the energy spectrum of a pulsar at
around the cut-off energy, i.e., at energies between a few GeV and a few tens
of GeV. All past attempts (>10) to measure pulsars with ground-based
instruments have failed while satellite-borne detectors had a too small area to
study detailed spectra in the GeV domain.
  In this thesis, the gamma-ray emission at around the cut-off energy from the
Crab pulsar is studied with the MAGIC telescope. The public data of the
satellite-borne gamma-ray detector, Fermi-LAT, are also analyzed in order to
discuss the MAGIC observation results in comparison with the adjacent energy
band.

usually be described by one Gaussian convolution kernel. This can be a crude
approximation and we need a linear combination of 2/3 Gaussian kernels to
account for tails.If image structures are recorded by appropriate measurements,
these structures are always blurred. The ideal image (source function without
any blurring) is subjected to Gaussian convolutions to yield a blurred image,
which is recorded by a detector array. The inverse problem of this procedure is
the determination of the ideal source image from really determined image. If
the scatter parameters are known, we are able to calculate the idealistic
source structure by a deconvolution. We shall extend it to linear combinations
of two/three Gaussian convolution kernels in order to found applications to
aforementioned image processing, where a single Gaussian kernel would be crude.
In this communication, we shall derive a new deconvolution method for a linear
combination of 2/3 Gaussian kernels with different rms values, namely the
formulation of an inhomogeneous Fredholm integral equation of second kind and
the related Liouville - Neumann series (LNS) to calculate solutions in every
desired order. The LNS solution provides the source function rho in terms of
the Fredholm kernel Kf. We can verify some advantages of LNS in image
processing. Applications of the LNS solution are inverse problems (2 or 3
Gaussian kernels) of image processing in CBCT and IMRT detector arrays of
portal imaging. A particular advantage of LNS is given, if the scatter
functions depend on x,y,z. This fact implies that the scatter functions can be
scaled according to the electron density provided by image reconstruction
procedures.

which allows to calculate the friction velocity u* via the spectrum of waves S

equation for the momentum flux, averaged over the wave-field ensemble, which
takes place in the wave-zone located between troughs and crests of waves.
Derivation of the balance equation is presented, and the following main
features of the model are formulated. First, the total momentum flux includes
only two physically different types of components: the ""wave"" part TAUw
associated with the energy transfer to waves, and the ""tangential"" part TAUt
that does not provide such transfer. Second, component TAUw is split into two
constituents having different mathematical representation: (a) for the
low-frequency (energy-containing) part of the wave spectrum, the analytical
expression of momentum flux TAUw is given directly via the local wind at the
standard horizon, W; (b) for the high-frequency part of the wave spectrum, flux
TAUw is determined by friction velocity u*. Third, the tangential component of
the momentum flux TAUt is parameterized by using the similarity theory,
assuming that the wave-zone is an analogue of the traditional friction layer,
and in this zone the constant eddy viscosity is realized, inherent to the wave
state. The constructed model was verified on the basis of simultaneous
measurements of two-dimensional wave spectrum S and friction velocity u*, done
for a series of fixed values of W. It is shown that the mean value of the
relative error for the drag coefficient, obtained with the proposed model, is
15-20%, only.

that for $t>k = 3$ and $\gamma >0$, $ t^3_{2}(n,K_t^3) \le (1-
\frac{2}{t^2-3t+4} + \gamma) n$ provided $n$ is large and $t | n$. We also
bound $t^3_{2}(n,K_t^3)$ from below. In particular, we deduce that
$t^3_2(n,K_4^3) = (3/4+o(1))n$ answering a question of Pikhurko. In addition,
we prove that $t^k_{k-1}(n,K_t^k) \le (1- \binom{t-1}{k-1}^{-1} + \gamma)n$ for
$\gamma >0$, $k \ge 6$ and $t \ge (3+ \sqrt5)k/2$ provided $n$ is large and $t
| n$.

the Mott metal-to-insulator transition in various of the title
quasi-two-dimensional organic charge-transfer salts by means of fluctuation
(noise) spectroscopy. The observed $1/f$-type fluctuations are quantitatively
very well described by a phenomenological model based on the concept of
non-exponetial kinetics. The main result is a correlation-induced enhancement
of the fluctuations accompanied by a substantial shift of spectral weight to
low frequencies close to the Mott critical endpoint. This sudden slowing down
of the electron dynamics may be a universal feature of metal-to-insulator
transitons. For the less correlated metallic materials, we find a
crossover/transition from hopping transport of more-or-less localized carriers
at elevated temperatures to a low-temperature regime, where a metallic coupling
of the layers allows for coherent interlayer transport of delocalized
electrons.

Updated from previous version",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.86.046107",,"physics.geo-ph physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Earthquakes are a complex spatiotemporal phenomenon, the underlying mechanism
for which is still not fully understood despite decades of research and
analysis. We propose and develop a network approach to earthquake events. In
this network, a node represents a spatial location while a link between two
nodes represents similar activity patterns in the two different locations. The
strength of a link is proportional to the strength of the cross-correlation in
activities of two nodes joined by the link. We apply our network approach to a
Japanese earthquake catalog spanning the 14-year period 1985-1998. We find
strong links representing large correlations between patterns in locations
separated by more than 1000 km, corroborating prior observations that
earthquake interactions have no characteristic length scale. We find network
characteristics not attributable to chance alone, including a large number of
network links, high node assortativity, and strong stability over time.

on the principle of physical-layer network coding. To date, only a simplified
version of physical-layer network coding (PNC) method, called analog network
coding (ANC), has been successfully implemented. The advantage of ANC is that
it is simple to implement; the disadvantage, on the other hand, is that the
relay amplifies the noise along with the signal before forwarding the signal.
PNC systems in which the relay performs XOR or other denoising PNC mappings of
the received signal have the potential for significantly better performance.
However, the implementation of such PNC systems poses many challenges. For
example, the relay must be able to deal with symbol and carrier-phase
asynchronies of the simultaneous signals received from the two end nodes, and
the relay must perform channel estimation before detecting the signals. We
investigate a PNC implementation in the frequency domain, referred to as FPNC,
to tackle these challenges. FPNC is based on OFDM. In FPNC, XOR mapping is
performed on the OFDM samples in each subcarrier rather than on the samples in
the time domain. We implement FPNC on the universal soft radio peripheral
(USRP) platform. Our implementation requires only moderate modifications of the
packet preamble design of 802.11a/g OFDM PHY. With the help of the cyclic
prefix (CP) in OFDM, symbol asynchrony and the multi-path fading effects can be
dealt with in a similar fashion. Our experimental results show that
symbol-synchronous and symbol-asynchronous FPNC have essentially the same BER
performance, for both channel-coded and unchannel-coded FPNC.

Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) concept using data recorded in high granularity
calorimeters. Pairs of overlaid pion showers from CALICE 2007 test beam data
are reconstructed by the PandoraPFA program developed to implement PFA for a
future lepton collider. Recovery of a neutral hadron's energy in the vicinity
of a charged hadron is studied. The impact of the two overlapping hadron
showers on energy resolution is investigated. The dependence of the confusion
error on the distance between a 10 GeV neutral hadron and a charged pion is
derived for pion energies of 10 and 30 GeV which are representative of a 100
GeV jet. The comparison of these test beam data results with Monte Carlo
simulation is done for various hadron shower models within the GEANT4
framework. The results for simulated particles and for beam data are in good
agreement thereby providing support for previous simulation studies of the
power of Particle Flow Calorimetry at a future lepton collider.
