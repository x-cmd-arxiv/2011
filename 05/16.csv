matter density fields, we investigate the consequences of these transforms for
cosmological parameter estimation. The power spectrum of the log-density
provides the tightest cosmological parameter error bars (marginalized or not),
giving a factor of 2-3 improvement over the conventional power spectrum in all
five parameters tested. For the tilt, n_s, the improvement reaches a factor of
5. Similar constraints are achieved if the log-density power spectrum and
conventional power spectrum are analyzed together. Rank-order Gaussianization
seems just as useful as a log transform to constrain n_s, but not other
parameters. Dividing the overdensity by its dispersion in few-Mpc cells, while
it diagonalizes the covariance matrix, does not seem to help with parameter
constraints. We also provide a code that emulates these power spectra over a

source such as a planet or a protoplanetary disk. Future facilities like SPHERE

exoplanets. The Extreme Polarimeter (ExPo) is a dual-beam imaging polarimeter
that currently can reach contrast ratios of 10^5, enough to characterize
circumstellar environments. We present the data reduction steps for a dual-beam
imaging polarimeter that can reach contrast ratios of 10^5. The data obtained
with ExPo at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) are analyzed. Instrumental
artifacts and noise sources are discussed for an unpolarized star and for a
protoplanetary disk (AB Aurigae). The combination of fast modulation and
dual-beam techniques allow us to minimize instrumental artifacts. A proper data
processing and alignment of the images is fundamental when dealing with large
contrasts. Imaging polarimetry proves to be a powerful method to resolve

focused on p-adic self-similar strings, in which the nonarchimedean theory
takes a more natural form than its archimedean counterpart. In contrast with
the archimedean setting, all p-adic self-similar strings are lattice and hence,
their complex dimensions (as well as their zeros) are periodically distributed
along finitely many vertical lines. The general theory is illustrated by some
simple examples, the nonarchimedean Cantor, Euler, and Fibonacci strings.

7 X-ray sources, 3 of which are previously unidentified. This cluster hosts a
well-known bright low-mass X-ray binary, source A (or XB 1832-330). Source B
shows unusual rapid flaring variability, with an average L_X(0.5-10 keV)
~2*10^{34} ergs/s, but with minutes-long flares up to L_X=9*10^{34} ergs/s. Its
spectrum can be fit by an absorbed power-law of photon index Gamma~1.24, and
hardens as the countrate decreases. This suggests that part or all of the
variation might be due to obscuration by the rim of a highly inclined accretion
disk. Sources C and D, with L_X ~10^{33} ergs/s, have soft and unusual spectra.
Source C requires a very soft component, with a spectrum peaking at 0.5 keV,
which might be the hot polar cap of a magnetically accreting polar cataclysmic
variable.
  Source D shows a soft spectrum (fit by a power-law of photon index ~2.3) with
marginal evidence for an emission line around 1 keV; its nature is unclear. The
faint new sources E, F, and G have luminosities of 1-2*10^{32} ergs/s, if
associated with the cluster (which is likely). E and F have relatively hard
spectra (consistent with power-laws with photon index ~1.5). G lacks soft
photons, suggesting absorption with N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2}.

very opposite orientations, in specialization of universities in the UK. We
find a polarity in specialism that goes considerably beyond the usual one of

point to the role of medical/bioscience research income in the former, and
economic and business sectoral niche player roles in the latter.

appreciated, and indeed can all be viewed as a common mass bound specialized
for a variety of purposes. A consequence of this is that one may understand
better the strengths and weaknesses of each variable, and the circumstances in
which each can be used to best effect. In order to achieve this, we find it
necessary first to revisit the seemingly empty and infertile wilderness
populated by the subscript ""T"" (as in pT) in order to remind ourselves what
this process of transversification actually means. We note that, far from being
simple, transversification can mean quite different things to different people.

kernel has been effectively and extensively applied in many areas of machine
learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and kernel principal component
analysis (kernel PCA). Kernel trick is to define a kernel function which relies
on the inner-product of data in the feature space without knowing these feature
space data. In this paper, the kernel trick will be employed to extend the
algorithm of spectrum sensing with leading eigenvector under the framework of
PCA to a higher dimensional feature space. Namely, the leading eigenvector of
the sample covariance matrix in the feature space is used for spectrum sensing
without knowing the leading eigenvector explicitly. Spectrum sensing with
leading eigenvector under the framework of kernel PCA is proposed with the
inner-product as a measure of similarity. A modified kernel GLRT algorithm
based on matched subspace model will be the first time applied to spectrum
sensing. The experimental results on simulated sinusoidal signal show that
spectrum sensing with kernel PCA is about 4 dB better than PCA, besides, kernel
GLRT is also better than GLRT. The proposed algorithms are also tested on the
measured DTV signal. The simulation results show that kernel methods are 4 dB
better than the corresponding linear methods. The leading eigenvector of the
sample covariance matrix learned by kernel PCA is more stable than that learned
by PCA for different segments of DTV signal.

astrophysical properties of the condensate (density profile, rotational

principle. To test the validity of the model we compare first the tangential
velocity equation of the model with a sample of eight rotation curves of dwarf
galaxies. We find a good agreement between the theoretically predicted rotation
curves (without any baryonic component) and the observational data. The mean
value of the logarithmic inner slope of the mass density profile of dwarf

Bose - Einstein condensate model are also systematically compared with the
predictions of the standard Cold Dark Matter model. The non-singular density
profiles of the Bose-Einstein condensed dark matter generally show the presence
of an extended core, whose presence is due to the strong interaction between

particular attention to the role played by complex spin variable j. The BPST

important concept in understanding qualitative behavior of the scattering

the saddle point contribution and at most a finite number of pole

point phase), kinematical variable (q,x,t) dependence of ln (1/q) evolution and

moderate intensity and short chain lengths, the approximation of a
mono-exponential decay of the magnetization fluctuations is found to be valid
at low temperatures; for strong fields and long chains, a multi-exponential
decay should rather be assumed. The effect of an oscillating magnetic field,
with intensity much smaller than that of the static one, is included in the

that, for an open chain with $N$ spins, $\chi(\omega)$ can be written as a
weighted sum of $N$ frequency contributions, with a sum rule relating the
frequency weights to the static susceptibility of the chain. Very good
agreement is found between the theoretical dynamic susceptibility and the ac
susceptibility measured in moderate static fields ($H_{\rm dc}\le 2$ kOe),

counterpart. During the first 10 days, the optical emission evolved as an
expanding, cooling blackbody after which an additional component, consistent
with a faint supernova, emerged. We determine its distance to 1.6 Gpc by
fitting the spectral-energy distribution and light curve of the optical
emission with a GRB-supernova template. Deep optical observations may have
revealed a faint, unresolved host galaxy. Our proposed progenitor is a helium
star-neutron star merger that underwent a common envelope phase expelling its
hydrogen envelope. The resulting explosion created a GRB-like jet which gets
thermalized by interacting with the dense, previously ejected material and thus
creating the observed black-body, until finally the emission from the supernova
dominated. An alternative explanation is a minor body falling onto a neutron
star in the Galaxy (Campana et al. 2011).

It is distinguished from a Gutzwiller-projected BCS superconductor by an
explicit separation of Cooper pairing and resonating valence bond (RVB)
pairing. Such a state satisfies the precise sign structure of the t-J model,
just like that a BCS state satisfies the Fermi-Dirac statistics. This new class
of wavefunctions can be intrinsically characterized and effectively manipulated
by electron fractionalization with neutral spinons and backflow spinons forming
a two-component RVB structure. While the former spinon is bosonic, originated
from the superexchange correlation, the latter spinon is found to be fermionic,
accompanying the hopping of bosonic holons. The low-lying emergent gauge fields
associated with such a specific fractionalization are of mutual Chern-Simons
type. Corresponding to this superconducting ground state, three types of
elementary excitations are identified. Among them a Bogoliubov nodal
quasiparticle is conventional, while the other two are neutral excitations of
non-BCS type that play crucial roles in higher energy/temperaure regimes. Their
unique experimental implications for the cuprates are briefly discussed.

However, when 1/R increases, the results of UED tend to diminish and at $1/R =

Compared with data from CDF of $B_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$, the 1/R tends to be
larger than $350 \mathrm{GeV}$. We also note that the zero crossing point of
the forward-backward asymmetry is become smaller, which will be an important
plat to prob the contribution from the extra dimension model. The results
obtained in this work will be very useful in searching new physics beyond SM.

compiled a deep catalogue of dwarf galaxies in the nearby Lynx-Cancer void.
This void hosts some of the most metal-poor dwarfs known to date. It borders
the Local Volume at the negative supergalactic Z (SGZ) coordinates and has the
size of more than 16 Mpc. With a distance to its centre of only 18 Mpc it is
close enough to allow the search for the faintest dwarfs. Within the void 75
dwarf (-11.9 > M_B > -18.0) and 4 subluminous (-18.0 > M_B > -18.4) galaxies
have been identified. We present the parameters of the void galaxies and give a
detailed analysis of the completeness of the catalogue as a function of
magnitude and surface brightness. The catalogue appears almost complete to M_B
< -14 mag, but misses part of the fainter low surface brightness (LSB) face-on
galaxies. This sample of void galaxies builds the basis of forthcoming
observational studies that will give insight into the main stellar population,
HI-mass-to-light ratio, metallicity and age for comparison with dwarfs in
higher density regions. We briefly summarize the information on the unusual
objects in the void and conclude that their concentration hints that voids are
environments that are favourable for finding and studying unevolved dwarf
galaxies.

standard techniques fail to yield sharp results. A sharp minimax lower bound is
established by applying the general lower bound technique based on testing two

bounding the chi-square distance between two normal mixtures. An estimator is
constructed using approximation theory and Hermite polynomials and is shown to
be asymptotically sharp minimax when the means are bounded by a given value
$M$. It is shown that the minimax risk equals $\beta_*^2M^2({\frac{\log\log

ejecta properties such as density and composition, which in turn can tell us
about their progenitors and the explosion mechanism. A very large number of
atomic processes are important for spectrum formation. Several tools for
calculating SN spectra exist, but they mainly focus on the very early or late
epochs. The intermediate phase, which requires a NLTE treatment of radiation
transport has rarely been studied. In this paper we present a new SN radiation
transport code, NERO, which can look at those epochs. All the atomic processes
are treated in full NLTE, under a steady-state assumption. This is a valid
approach between roughly 50 and 500 days after the explosion depending on SN
type. This covers the post-maximum photospheric and the early and the
intermediate nebular phase. As a test, we compare NERO to the radiation
transport code of Jerkstrand et al. (2011) and to the nebular code of Mazzali
et al. (2001). All three codes have been developed independently and a
comparison provides a valuable opportunity to investigate their reliability.
Currently, NERO is one-dimensional and can be used for predicting spectra of
synthetic explosion models or for deriving SN properties by spectral modelling.
To demonstrate this, we study the spectra of the 'normal' SN Ia 2005cf between
50 and 350 days after the explosion and identify most of the common SN Ia line
features at post maximum epochs.

true for relative, i.e. oracle-based computations. Conversely, by the

  In their search for a similar topological characterization of relatively
computable multivalued functions f:[0,1]=>R (aka relations), Brattka and
Hertling (1994) have considered two notions: weak continuity (which is weaker
than relative computability) and strong continuity (which is stronger than
relative computability). Observing that uniform continuity plays a crucial role
in the Weierstrass Theorem, we propose and compare several notions of uniform
continuity for relations. Here, due to the additional quantification over
values y in f(x), new ways of (linearly) ordering quantifiers arise, yet none
of them turn out as satisfactory.
  We are thus led to a notion of uniform continuity based on the Henkin
Quantifier; and prove it necessary for relative computability. In fact
iterating this condition yields a strict hierarchy of notions each necessary,
and the omega-th level also sufficient, for relative computability.

particles and particle size will also affect the calculated infrared colours.
Large particles also tend to be strongly forward-scattering, and we show that
assuming isotropic scattering in this case also leads to very large errors in
the spectrum. Thus, care must be taken in the choice of radiative transfer
method for heat balance or spectral calculations when clouds are present in the
atmosphere. Besides the choice of radiative transfer method, the type of
particles that are predicted by models will change conclusions about e.g.
infrared colours and trace gas abundances. As a result, knowledge of the
scattering properties of the clouds is essential when deriving temperature
profiles or gas abundances from direct infrared observations of exoplanets or
brown dwarfs and from secondary eclipse measurements of transiting exoplanets,
since scattering clouds will change the depth of gas absorption features, among
other things. Thus, ignoring the presence of clouds can yield retrieved
properties that differ significantly from the real atmospheric properties.

that appear to be missing a broad iron K alpha line. These objects represent a
challenge to the established paradigm for active galactic nuclei, where a
relatively cold accretion disc feeds the central black hole. In that paradigm,
X-ray illumination of the accretion disc should lead to continuum and
fluorescence emission from iron which is broadened and shifted by relativistic
effects close the hole. We extend the work of Nandra et al. (2007), who found
no evidence for such a component in an earlier analysis of these objects, by
testing a variety of more complex relativistic reflection models. Specifically,
we consider the possibility that the disc is highly ionised, and/or that the
the reflection is heavily blurred by strong relativistic effects in a Kerr
geometry. We find that in 8/11 of the observations with no apparent broad iron
line, the fit is significantly improved when an ionised or strongly blurred
reflector is included, and that all 11 observations allow for such a component.
The disc inclinations are found generally to be around 60 degrees, which when
combined with a steep emissivity profile results in strong relativistic
blurring of the reflection, rendering the K alpha line difficult to distinguish
from the underlying continuum. Nevertheless, relativistic reflection does
appear to be present, and the strength of the smeared reflection is similar to
that expected from a flat disc illuminated by a point source. Such blurred
reflection and the associated steep radial emissivity profiles are consistent
with the gravitational light bending of the continuum photons close to the
black hole.

noise. This flickering produces transient peaks in the observed power spectrum
in the 15-65 min period range. Only in one of our 12 optical datasets can we
see evidence for a period that cannot be reproduced using the red noise model.
This period of 51 minutes coincides with the strongest period detected by
Shahbaz et al. (2008) and can thus be taken as the prime candidate for the

correlated with the surface density of molecular gas. This has lead many
authors to suggest that there exists a causal relationship between the chemical
state of the gas and its ability to form stars -- in other words, the
assumption that the gas must be molecular before star formation can occur. We
test this hypothesis by modelling star formation within a dense cloud of gas
with properties similar to a small molecular cloud using a series of different
models of the chemistry, ranging from one in which the formation of molecules
is not followed and the gas is assumed to remain atomic throughout, to one that
tracks the formation of both H2 and CO. We find that presence of molecules in
the gas has little effect on the ability of the gas to form stars: star
formation can occur just as easily in atomic gas as in molecular gas. At low
densities (< 10^4 cm^-3), the gas is able to cool via C+ fine-structure
emission almost as efficiently as via CO rotational line emission, while at
higher densities, the main cooling process involves the transfer of energy from
gas to dust, meaning that the presence of molecules is again unimportant.
Cooling by H2 is particularly inefficient, accounting for as little as 1
percent of the overall cooling in the cloud. Rather than the chemical makeup,
we find that the most important factor controlling the rate of star formation
is the ability of the gas to shield itself from the interstellar radiation
field. As this is also a prerequisite for the survival of molecules within the
gas, our results support a picture in which molecule formation and the
formation of cold gas are both correlated with the column density of the cloud
-- and thus its ability to shield itself -- rather than being directly
correlated with each other.

common principles of processing are employed throughout its extent. In
particular, the patterns of connectivity observed in the superficial layers of
the visual cortex are consistent with the recurrent excitation and inhibitory
feedback required for cooperative-competitive circuits such as the soft
winner-take-all (WTA). WTA circuits offer interesting computational properties
such as selective amplification, signal restoration, and decision making. But,
these properties depend on the signal gain derived from positive feedback, and
so there is a critical trade-off between providing feedback strong enough to
support the sophisticated computations, while maintaining overall circuit
stability. We consider the question of how to reason about stability in very
large distributed networks of such circuits. We approach this problem by
approximating the regular cortical architecture as many interconnected
cooperative-competitive modules. We demonstrate that by properly understanding
the behavior of this small computational module, one can reason over the
stability and convergence of very large networks composed of these modules. We
obtain parameter ranges in which the WTA circuit operates in a high-gain
regime, is stable, and can be aggregated arbitrarily to form large stable
networks. We use nonlinear Contraction Theory to establish conditions for
stability in the fully nonlinear case, and verify these solutions using
numerical simulations. The derived bounds allow modes of operation in which the
WTA network is multi-stable and exhibits state-dependent persistent activities.
Our approach is sufficiently general to reason systematically about the
stability of any network, biological or technological, composed of networks of
small modules that express competition through shared inhibition.

personal robot. An object should not only be placed stably, but should also be
placed in its preferred location/orientation. For instance, a plate is
preferred to be inserted vertically into the slot of a dish-rack as compared to
be placed horizontally in it. Unstructured environments such as homes have a
large variety of object types as well as of placing areas. Therefore our
algorithms should be able to handle placing new object types and new placing
areas. These reasons make placing a challenging manipulation task. In this
work, we propose a supervised learning algorithm for finding good placements
given the point-clouds of the object and the placing area. It learns to combine
the features that capture support, stability and preferred placements using a
shared sparsity structure in the parameters. Even when neither the object nor
the placing area is seen previously in the training set, our algorithm predicts

determine the density and the kinetic temperature of this relatively warm gas

filaments is large 10E9 Msun (assuming a Galactic N(H2)/Ico ratio). This is 10%
of the total mass of molecular gas detected in this cD galaxy. This gas has
large-scale velocities comparable to those seen in Halpha. The origin of the
filaments is still unclear, but their formation is very likely linked to the
AGN positive feedback (Revaz et al., 2008) that regulates the cooling of the
surrounding X-ray-emitting gas as suggested by numerical simulations. We also
present high-resolution spectra of the galaxy core. The spatial characteristics
of the double-peaked profile suggest that the molecular web of filaments and
streamers penetrates down to radii of less than 2 kpc from the central AGN and
eventually feed the galaxy nucleus. The mass of gas inside the very central
region is ~10E^9 Msun, and is similar to the mass of molecular gas found in the

thus their relative momenta are negligibly small (just to fulfill the

But in dense nuclear matter, those $\alpha$ particles still obey the Pauli

making $^8Be$ which leave the ground state energy unchanged. Further braiding

quantization of Yang-Mills theories and perturbative quantum gravity in curved

Faddeev-Popov ghosts for Yang-Mills theories and perturbative quantum gravity
in the covariant gauge. In the third part we investigate the physical
equivalence of covariant Wightman graviton two-point function with the physical
graviton two-point function.
  The Feynman propagators of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts for Yang-Mills theories
and perturbative quantum gravity in the covariant gauge are infrared (IR)
divergent in de Sitter spacetime. We point out, that if we regularize these
divergences by introducing a finite mass and take the zero mass limit at the
end, then the modes responsible for these divergences will not contribute to
loop diagrams in computations of time-ordered products in either Yang-Mills
theories or perturbative quantum gravity. We thus find effective Feynman
propagators for ghosts in Yang-Mills theories and perturbative quantum gravity
by subtracting out these divergent modes.
  It is known that the covariant graviton two-point function in de Sitter
spacetime is infrared divergent for some choices of gauge parameters. On the
other hand it is also known that there are no infrared problems for the
physical graviton two-point function obtained by fixing all gauge degrees of
freedom, in global coordinates. We show that the covariant Wightman graviton
two-point function is equivalent to the physical one in the sense that they
result in the same two-point function of any local gauge-invariant quantity.
Thus any infrared divergence in the Wightman graviton two-point function in de

visible in polar coronal holes, but are also present in plume-like structures
originating from equatorial coronal holes and quiet-Sun regions. Outflows are
also visible in the ""interplume"" regions throughout the atmosphere.
Furthermore, the structures traced out by these flows in both plume and
inter-plume regions continually exhibit transverse (Alfvenic) motion. Our
finding suggests that high-speed outflows originate mainly from the magnetic
network of the quiet Sun and coronal holes, and that the plume flows observed
are highlighted by the denser plasma contained therein. These outflows might be
an efficient means to provide heated mass into the corona and serve as an
important source of mass supply to the solar wind. We demonstrate that the

the internal angular momentum transport processes. The double zone model, in
which the star's radiative core and convective envelope are assumed to rotate
as solid bodies, is used to test simple relationships between the core-envelope
coupling timescale, tau_c, and rotational properties, like the envelope angular
velocity or the differential rotation at the core-envelope interface. The trial
relationships are tested by fitting the model parameters to available
observations via a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. The synthetic distributions
are tested for compatibility with their observational counterparts by means of
the standard Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. A power-law dependence of tau_c on
the inner differential rotation leads to a more satisfactory agreement with
observations than a two-value prescription for tau_c, which would imply a
dichotomy between the initially slow (P_rot > 3 d) and fast (P_rot < 3 d)
rotators. However, we find it impossible to reconcile the high fraction of fast
rotators in alpha Per with the rotation period distributions in stellar systems
at earlier and later evolutionary stages. This could be explained by local
environmental effects (e.g. early removal of circumstellar discs due to UV
radiation and winds from nearby high-mass stars) or by observational biases.
The low KS probability that the synthetic and observed distributions are not
incompatible, found in some cases, may be due to over-simplified assumptions of
the double zone model, but the large relative uncertainties in the age
determination of very young clusters and associations are expected to play a

time parameter itself be an integer-valued process, and call the orginal
process a random walk at random time. We find the scaling limit which
generalizes the so-called iterated Brownian motion. Khoshnevisan and Lewis
[Ann. Appl. Probab. 9 (1999) 629-667] suggested ""the existence of a form of
measure-theoretic duality"" between iterated Brownian motion and a Brownian
motion in random scenery. We show that a random walk at random time can be
considered a random walk in ""alternating"" scenery, thus hinting at a mechanism
behind this duality. Following Cohen and Samorodnitsky [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16
(2006) 1432-1461], we also consider alternating random reward schema associated
to random walks at random times. Whereas random reward schema scale to local
time fractional stable motions, we show that the alternating random reward
schema scale to indicator fractional stable motions. Finally, we show that one
may recursively ""subordinate"" random time processes to get new local time and
indicator fractional stable motions and new stable processes in random scenery
or at random times. When $\alpha=2$, the fractional stable motions given by the
recursion are fractional Brownian motions with dyadic $H\in(0,1)$. Also, we see
that ""un-subordinating"" via a time-change allows one to, in some sense, extract
Brownian motion from fractional Brownian motions with $H<1/2$.

  Representation","To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), 2011.
  30 pages",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weight constraint and aggregate programs are among the most widely used logic
programs with constraints. In this paper, we relate the semantics of these two
classes of programs, namely the stable model semantics for weight constraint
programs and the answer set semantics based on conditional satisfaction for
aggregate programs. Both classes of programs are instances of logic programs
with constraints, and in particular, the answer set semantics for aggregate
programs can be applied to weight constraint programs. We show that the two
semantics are closely related. First, we show that for a broad class of weight
constraint programs, called strongly satisfiable programs, the two semantics
coincide. When they disagree, a stable model admitted by the stable model
semantics may be circularly justified. We show that the gap between the two
semantics can be closed by transforming a weight constraint program to a
strongly satisfiable one, so that no circular models may be generated under the
current implementation of the stable model semantics. We further demonstrate
the close relationship between the two semantics by formulating a
transformation from weight constraint programs to logic programs with nested
expressions which preserves the answer set semantics. Our study on the
semantics leads to an investigation of a methodological issue, namely the
possibility of compact representation of aggregate programs by weight
constraint programs. We show that almost all standard aggregates can be encoded
by weight constraints compactly. This makes it possible to compute the answer
sets of aggregate programs using the ASP solvers for weight constraint
programs. This approach is compared experimentally with the ones where
aggregates are handled more explicitly, which show that the weight constraint
encoding of aggregates enables a competitive approach to answer set computation
for aggregate programs.
