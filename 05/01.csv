bound for data transmissions unrealistic to guarantee. In contrast, the
statistically-bounded delay with a small violation probability has been widely
used for delay quality-of-service (QoS) characterization and evaluation. While
existing research mainly focused on the statistical-delay control in single-hop
links, in this paper we propose the QoS-driven power-allocation scheme over
two-hop wireless relay links to statistically upper-bound the end-to-end delay
under the decodeand- forward (DF) relay transmissions. Specifically, by
applying the effective capacity and effective bandwidth theories, we first
analyze the delay-bound violation probability over two tops each with
independent service processes. Then, we show that an efficient approach for
statistical-delay guarantees is to make the delay distributions of both hops
identical, which, however, needs to be obtained through asymmetric resource
allocations over the two hops. Motivated by this fact, we formulate and solve
an optimization problem aiming at minimizing the average power consumptions to
satisfy the specified end-to-end delay-bound violation probability over two-hop
relay links. Also conducted is a set of simulations results to show the impact
of the QoS requirements, traffic load, and position of the relay node on the
power allocation under our proposed optimal scheme.

design over cognitive Ad Hoc networks (CAHNs) is how to efficiently utilize

propose a novel diversity technology called \emph{Multi-Channel Diversity}

MCD, we develop a MCD based MAC (MCD-MAC) protocol, which can efficiently
utilize available channel resources through joint power-channel allocation.
Particularly, we convert the joint power-channel allocation to the
Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem, such that we can obtain the optimal
transmission strategy to maximize the network throughput through dynamic
programming. Simulation results show that our proposed MCD-MAC protocol can
significantly increase the network throughput as compared to the existing

simple subsystems. In order to understand such large systems it is natural to
tear the system into these subsystems. Conversely we must understand how to
invert this tearing. In other words, we must understand interconnection. Such
an understanding has already successfully understood in the context of
Hamiltonian systems on vector spaces via the port-Hamiltonian systems program.
In port-Hamiltonian systems theory, interconnection is achieved through the
identification of shared variables, whereupon the notion of composition of
Dirac structures allows one to interconnect two systems. In this paper we seek
to extend the port-Hamiltonian systems program to Lagrangian systems on
manifolds and extend the notion of composition of Dirac structures
appropriately. In particular, we will interconnect Lagrange-Dirac systems by
modifying the respective Dirac structures of the involved subsystems. We define
the interconnection of Dirac structures via an interaction Dirac structure and
a tensor product of Dirac structures. We will show how the dynamics of the
interconnected system is formulated as a function of the subsystems, and we
will elucidate the associated variational principles. We will then illustrate
how this theory extends the theory of port-Hamiltonian systems and the notion
of composition of Dirac structures to manifolds with couplings which do not
require the identification of shared variables. Lastly, we will close with some
examples: a mass-spring mechanical systems, an electric circuit, and a
nonholonomic mechanical system.

171 UBV photometric observations of the 2010 eclipse, were analyzed in an
effort to better understand the eclipsing binary eps Aur. The main results
follow. (1) We attempted to recover a spectrum of the companion by
disentangling the observed spectra of the eps Aur binary failed, but we were
able to disentangle the spectrum of telluric lines and obtain a mean spectrum
of the F-type primary star. The latter was then compared to a grid of synthetic
spectra for a number of plausible values of T(eff) and log(g), but a reasonably
good match was not found. However, we conclude that the observed spectrum is
that of a low-gravity star. (2) We examined changes in the complex H-alpha line
profiles over the past 16 years, with particular emphasis on the 2009-2011
eclipse period, by subtracting a mean out-of-eclipse H-alpha profile
(appropriately shifted in radial velocity) from the observed spectra. We find
that the dark disk around the unseen companion has an extended 'atmosphere'
that manifests itself via blueshifted and redshifted H-alpha 'shell'
absorptions seen projected against the F star. Significantly, the H-alpha shell
line first appeared three years before first contact of the optical eclipse
when the system was not far past maximum separation. (3) Analyses of radial
velocities and central intensities of several strong, unblended spectral lines,
as well as UBV photometry, demonstrated that these observables showed apparent
multiperiodic variability during eclipse. The dominant period of 66.21 was
common to all the observables, but with different phase shifts between these
variables. This result strongly supports our earlier suggestion that the
photometric variability seen during eclipse is intrinsic to the F star, and
therefore, the idea of a central brightening due to a hole in the disk should
be abandoned.

cancelled by the existing O($a$) boundary counterterm. However, its

Kayser, and Refsdal (1988) proposed to use HAEs to study the central regions of
quasars in GLSs. In this paper, we consider some problems concerning the
identification of different source types on the basis of the HAE observations.
We compare the results of light curve simulations to estimate a feasibility to
distinguish different source models in GLSs. Analytic approximation methods
yielding solutions of the lens equation in a vicinity of fold caustic crossing
events are presented. The results are used to obtain amplification factors,
which the higher-order corrections for the Gaussian, power-law, and
limb-darkening models of a source take into account.

number of polytropic stellar models having different values of the
dimensionless angular momentum J/M^2, where J and M are the asymptotic angular
momentum and mass of the star, respectively. For neutron stars with J/M^2<1,
i.e., ""sub-Kerr"" models, we were able to find models that are dynamically
unstable and that collapse promptly to a rotating black hole. Both the dynamics
of the collapse and the consequent emission of gravitational waves resemble the
one seen for uniformly rotating stars, although with an overall decrease in the
efficiency of gravitational-wave emission. For stellar models with J/M^2>1,
i.e., ""supra-Kerr"" models, on the other hand, we were not able to find models
that are dynamically unstable and all of the computed supra-Kerr models were
found to be far from the stability threshold. For these models a gravitational
collapse is possible only after a very severe and artificial reduction of the
pressure, which then leads to a torus developing nonaxisymmetric instabilities
and eventually contracting to a stable axisymmetric stellar configuration.
While this does not exclude the possibility that a naked singularity can be
produced by the collapse of a differentially rotating star, it also suggests
that cosmic censorship is not violated and that generic conditions for a
supra-Kerr progenitor do not lead to a naked singularity.

variability of the luminous blue variable star V532 in M33. The photometric
variations are traced from 1960 to 2010, spectral variations - from 1992 to
2009. The star has revealed an absolute maximum of visual brightness
(1992-1994, high/cold state) and an absolute minimum (2007-2008, low/hot
state). The variability of the spectrum of V532 is fully consistent with the
temperature variations in its photosphere, while both permitted and forbidden
lines are formed in an extended stellar atmosphere. Broad components of the
brightest lines were found, the broadening of these components is due to
electron scattering in the wind parts closest to the photosphere. The wind
velocity clearly depends on the size of the stellar photosphere or on the
visual brightness, when brightness declines, the wind velocity increases. In
the absolute minimum a kinematic profile of the V532 atmosphere was detected.
The wind velocity increases and its temperature declines with distance from the
star. In the low/hot state, the spectral type of the star corresponds to
WN8.5h, in the high/cold state - to WN11. We studied the evolution of V532
along with the evolution of AG Car and the massive WR binary HD5980 in SMC.
During their visual minima, all the three stars perfectly fit with the WNL star
sequence by Crowther and Smith (1997). However, when visual brightness
increases, all the three stars form a separate sequence. It is possible that
this reflects a new property of LBV stars, namely, in the high/cold states they
do not pertain to the bona fide WNL stars.

  We introduce a notion of a sheaf of vector spaces on a graph, and develop the
foundations of homology theories for such sheaves. One sheaf invariant, its
""maximum excess,"" has a number of remarkable properties. It has a simple
definition, with no reference to homology theory, that resembles graph
expansion. Yet it is a ""limit"" of Betti numbers, and hence has a short/long
exact sequence theory and resembles the $L^2$ Betti numbers of Atiyah. Also,
the maximum excess is defined via a supermodular function, which gives the
maximum excess much stronger properties than one has of a typical Betti number.
  Our sheaf theory can be viewed as a vast generalization of algebraic graph
theory: each sheaf has invariants associated to it---such as Betti numbers and
Laplacian matrices---that generalize those in classical graph theory.
  We shall use ""Galois graph theory"" to reduce the Strengthened Hanna Neumann
Conjecture to showing that certain sheaves, that we call $\rho$-kernels, have
zero maximum excess. We use the symmetry in Galois theory to argue that if the

the maximum energies of accelerated particles and result in specific features

field amplification by the CR currents and pressure anisotropies may affect the
shocked gas temperatures and compression, both in the shock precursor and in
the downstream flow, if the shock is an efficient CR accelerator. Strong
fluctuations of the magnetic field on scales above the radiation formation
length in the shock vicinity result in intermittent structures observable in
synchrotron emission images. Resonant and non-resonant CR streaming
instabilities in the shock precursor can generate mesoscale magnetic fields

limit theorems in probability theory play an important role in the development
of probability theory and its applications. Strassen (1964) extended LIL to
large classes of functional random variables, it is well known as the
invariance principle for LIL which provide an extremely powerful tool in
probability and statistical inference. But recently many phenomena show that
the linearity of probability is a limit for applications, for example in
finance, statistics. As while a nonlinear expectation--- G-expectation has
attracted extensive attentions of mathematicians and economists, more and more
people began to study the nature of the G-expectation space. A natural question
is: Can the classical invariance principle for LIL be generalized under
G-expectation space? This paper gives a positive answer. We present the
invariance principle of G-Brownian motion for the law of the iterated logarithm
under G-expectation.

continuum model analysis for the overall mechanical properties of

l_{0}, defined as \Sqrt{Dh_{0}/4G}, where D is the stiffness of the graphene
sheet, h_{0} and G are the height of interlayer crosslink and shear modulus
respectively. When the size of the graphene sheets exceeds 3l_{0}, the
tension-shear (TS) chain model that are widely used for nanocomposites fails to
predict the overall mechanical properties of the graphene-based papers. Instead
we proposed here a deformable tension-shear (DTS) model by considering the
elastic deformation of the graphene sheets, also the interlayer and intralayer
crosslinks. The DTS is then applied to predict the mechanics of graphene-based
paper materials under tensile loading. According to the results we thus obtain,
optimal design strategies are provided for designing graphene papers with
ultrahigh stiffness, strength and toughness.

calculated {\em directly} within a realistic scenario for the storage and
release of superfluid vorticity; therefore, the explanation of giant glitches
in terms of vortices has not yet been tested against observations. We present
the first physically reasonable model, both at the microscopic and macroscopic
level (spherical geometry, n=1 polytropic density profile, density-dependent
pinning forces compatible with vortex rigidity), to determine where in the star
the vorticity is pinned, how much of it, and for how long. For standard neutron
star parameters ($M=1.4 M_{\odot}, R_s=10$ km, $\dot{\Omega}=\dot{\Omega}_{\rm
Vela}=-10^{-10}$ Hz s$^{-1}$), we find that maximum pinning forces of order
$f_m\approx10^{15}$ dyn cm$^{-1}$ can accumulate $\Delta L_{\rm
gl}\approx10^{40}$ erg s of superfluid angular momentum, and release it to the
crust at intervals $\Delta t_{\rm gl}\approx3$ years. This estimate of $\Delta
L_{\rm gl}$ is one order of magnitude smaller than what implied indirectly by
current models for post-glitch recovery, where the core and inner-crust
vortices are taken as physically disconnected; yet, it successfully yields the
magnitudes observed in recent Vela glitches for {\em both} jump parameters,
$\Delta\Omega_{\rm gl}$ and $\Delta\dot{\Omega}_{\rm gl}$, provided one assumes
that only a small fraction ($<10%$) of the total star vorticity is coupled to
the crust on the short timescale of a glitch. This is reasonable in our
approach, where no layer of normal matter exists between the core and the
inner-crust, as indicated by existing microscopic calculation. The new scenario
presented here is nonetheless compatible with current post-glitch models.

the observation of objects at large galactiocentric distances. With this aim,
we are exploring the planetary nebula population towards the Galactic
Anticentre. In this article, the discovery and physico-chemical study of a new
planetary nebula towards the Anticentre direction, IPHASX J052531.19+281945.1
(PNG 178.1-04.0), is presented. The planetary nebula was discovered from the
IPHAS survey. Long-slit follow-up spectroscopy was carried out to confirm its
planetary nebula nature and to calculate its physical and chemical
characteristics. The newly discovered planetary nebula turned out to be located
at a very large galactocentric distance (D_GC=20.8+-3.8 kpc), larger than any
previously known planetary nebula with measured abundances. Its relatively high
oxygen abundance (12+log(O/H) = 8.36+-0.03) supports a flattening of the
Galactic abundance gradient at large galactocentric distances rather than a
linearly decreasing gradient.

consider the asymptotic behavior of the galactic rotation curves in the brane

High Surface Brightness and Low Surface Brightness galaxies. For the chosen
sample of galaxies we determine first the baryonic parameters by fitting the
photometric data to the adopted galaxy model; then we test the hypothesis of
the Weyl fluid acting as dark matter on the chosen sample of spiral galaxies by
fitting the tangential velocity equation of the combined baryonic-Weyl model to
the rotation curves. We give an analytical expression for the rotational
velocity of a test particle on a stable circular orbit in the exterior region
to a galaxy, with Weyl fluid contributions included. The model parameter ranges
for which the $\chi^2$ test provides agreement (within 1$\sigma$ confidence
level) with observations on the velocity fields of the chosen galaxy sample are
then determined. There is a good agreement between the theoretical predictions

long-range magnetic order arises from the combined effect of crystal symmetry

screening masses are calculated through an Ansatz from the zero-temperature
case, based on complex-conjugate poles for the momentum-space propagators. As
recently reported in [1], we find good fits to the proposed form at all
temperatures considered, with different ratios of real to imaginary part of the
pole masses for the longitudinal (electric) and transverse (magnetic)
propagators. The behavior of the magnetic propagator D_T(p) is in agreement
with the dimensional-reduction picture, showing infrared suppression (with a
turnover in momentum) and violation of spectral positivity at all nonzero
temperatures considered. The longitudinal propagator D_L(p) appears to reach a
plateau at small momenta and is subject to severe finite-Nt effects around the
critical temperature Tc. As a consequence, only lattices with temporal extent
Nt > 8 seem to be free from systematic errors. After these errors are removed,
the infrared-plateau value is considerably reduced around the transition and
the sharp peak observed previously for this quantity at Tc is no longer
present. The resulting infrared behavior for D_L(p) at Tc is essentially the
same as for 0.5Tc . An investigation of the temperature range between 0.5Tc and

involving harmonic numbers and derangement numbers. As examples, we use the
Abel-Zeilberger algorithm to prove the Paule-Schneider identities, the
Apery-Schmidt-Strehl identity, Calkin's identity and some identities involving
Fibonacci numbers.

full scaling property, an almost model-independent description of the
proton-proton differential cross section data at high energies (19.4 GeV - 62.5
GeV) is obtained. In the impact parameter and eikonal frameworks, the extracted
inelastic overlap function presents a peripheral effect (tail) above 2 fm and
the extracted opacity function is characterized by a zero (change of sign) in
the momentum transfer space, confirming results from previous model-independent
analyses. Analytical parametrization for these empirical results are introduced
and discussed. The importance of investigations on the inverse problems in
high-energy elastic hadron scattering is stressed and the relevance of the
proposed representation is commented. A short critical review on the use of
Martin's formula is also presented.
