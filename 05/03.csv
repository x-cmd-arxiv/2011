cosmological data but can be used in other fields where one must interpolate
quantities given at a discrete point set. The software comes with a wide suite
of options to facilitate the analysis of 2- and 3-dimensional data and of both
numerical simulations and galaxy redshift surveys. For comparison purposes, the

gamma-ray emitters can provide insight into their relative contributions to the
extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) and the natures of their spectra at
GeV energies. We calculate the spectral shapes of the contributions to the EGB
arising from BL Lacertae type objects (BL Lacs) and flat-spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs) assuming blazar spectra can be described as broken power laws. We fit
the resulting total blazar spectral shape to the Fermi Large Area Telescope
measurements of the EGB, finding that the best-fit shape reproduces well the
shape of the Fermi EGB for various break scenarios. We conclude that a scenario
in which the contribution of blazars is dominant cannot be excluded on spectral
grounds alone, even if spectral breaks are shown to be common among Fermi
blazars. We also find that while the observation of a featureless (within
uncertainties) power-law EGB spectrum by Fermi does not necessarily imply a
single class of contributing unresolved sources with featureless individual
spectra, such an observation and the collective spectra of the separate
contributing populations determine the ratios of their contributions. As such,
a comparison with studies including blazar gamma-ray luminosity functions could
have profound implications for the blazar contribution to the EGB, blazar
evolution, and blazar gamma-ray spectra and emission.

molecules, it is very common to impose holonomic constraints on the fastest
degrees of freedom; normally bond lengths, but also possibly bond angles.
However, as any other element that affects the physical model, the imposition
of constraints must be assessed from the point of view of accuracy: both the
dynamics and the equilibrium statistical mechanics are model-dependent, and
they will be changed if constraints are used. In this review, we investigate
the accuracy of constrained models at the level of the equilibrium statistical
mechanics distributions produced by the different dynamics. We carefully derive
the canonical equilibrium distributions of both the constrained and
unconstrained dynamics, comparing the two of them by means of a ""stiff""
approximation to the latter. We do so both in the case of flexible and hard
constraints, i.e., when the value of the constrained coordinates depends on the
conformation and when it is a constant number. We obtain the different
correcting terms associated with the kinetic energy mass-metric tensor
determinants, but also with the details of the potential energy in the vicinity
of the constrained subspace (encoded in its first and second derivatives). This
allows us to directly compare, at the conformational level, how the imposition
of constraints changes the thermal equilibrium of molecular systems with
respect to the unconstrained case. We also provide an extensive review of the
relevant literature, and we show that all models previously reported can be
considered special cases of the most general treatments presented in this work.
Finally, we numerically analyze a simple methanol molecule in order to
illustrate the theoretical concepts in a practical case.

over the decades. The introduction of transformational optics has revitalized
this field by providing a general method to design material distributions to
hide the subject from detection. By transforming space and light propagation, a
three-dimensional (3D) object is perceived as having a reduced number of
dimensions, in the form of points, lines, and thin sheets, making it
""undetectable"" judging from the scattered field. Although a variety of cloaking
devices have been reported at microwave and optical frequencies, the
spectroscopically important Terahertz (THz) domain remains unexplored.
Moreover, due to the difficulties in fabricating cloaking devices that are
optically large in all three dimensions, hiding realistic 3D objects has yet to
be demonstrated. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a 3D
THz cloaking device fabricated using a scalable Projection
Microstereolithography process. The cloak operates at a broad frequency range
between 0.3 and 0.6 THz, and is placed over an {\alpha}- lactose monohydrate
absorber with rectangular shape. Characterized using angularresolved reflection
THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), the results indicate that the THz
invisibility cloak has successfully concealed both the geometrical and
spectroscopic signatures of the absorber, making it undetectable to the
observer.

electronic phase existing in three dimensions that cannot be reduced to
multiple copies of quantum-Hall-like states. Their topological order can be
realized at room temperatures without magnetic fields and they can be turned
into magnets and exotic superconductors leading to world-wide interest and
activity in topological insulators. One of the major challenges in going from
quantum Hall-like 2D states to 3D topological insulators is to develop new
experimental approaches/methods to precisely probe this novel form of
topological-order since the standard tools and settings that work for IQH-state
also work for QSH states. The method to probe 2D topological-order is
exclusively with charge transport, which either measures quantized transverse
conductance plateaus in IQH systems or longitudinal conductance in quantum spin
Hall (QSH) systems. In a 3D topological insulator, the boundary itself supports
a two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and transport is not (Z$_2$)
topologically quantized. In this paper, we review the birth of momentum- and
spin-resolved spectroscopy as a new experimental approach and as a directly
boundary sensitive method to study and prove topological-order in
three-dimensions via the direct measurements of the topological invariants
{$\nu_o$} that are associated with the Z$_2$ topology of the spin-orbit band
structure and opposite parity band inversions, which led to the experimental
discovery of the first 3D topological insulators. We also discuss how
spectroscopic methods are leading to the identification of spin-orbit

energy resource under the demanded performance metrics. Based on the wireless
resource trading relationship, we derive the optimal energy-bandwidth and
energy-time wireless resource trading relationship for green wireless

bandwidths or different delays for different transmission distances with
available bandwidths and acceptable delay bounds in wireless networks. Our
conducted simulations show that the energy consumption of wireless networks can

waves in a coronal loop is developed. The model includes the lower atmospheres
at the two ends of the loop. The waves originate on small spatial scales (less
than 100 km) inside the kilogauss flux elements in the photosphere. The model
describes the nonlinear interactions between Alfven waves using the reduced MHD
approximation. The increase of Alfven speed with height in the chromosphere and
transition region (TR) causes strong wave reflection, which leads to
counter-propagating waves and turbulence in the photospheric and chromospheric
parts of the flux tube. Part of the wave energy is transmitted through the TR
and produces turbulence in the corona. We find that the hot coronal loops
typically found in active regions can be explained in terms of Alfven wave
turbulence, provided the small-scale footpoint motions have velocities of 1-2
km/s and time scales of 60-200 s. The heating rate per unit volume in the
chromosphere is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than that in the corona. We
construct a series of models with different values of the model parameters, and
find that the coronal heating rate increases with coronal field strength and
decreases with loop length. We conclude that coronal loops and the underlying

repulsion between a plate with a hole and a cylinder centered above it to
geometries in which the central object can no longer be treated as a point
dipole. We show through numerical calculations that as the distance between the
plate and central object decreases, there is an intermediate regime in which
the repulsive force increases dramatically. Beyond this, the force rapidly
switches over to attraction as the separation decreases further to zero, in
line with the proximity force approximation. We demonstrate that this effect
can be understood as a competition between an increased repulsion due to a
larger polarizability of the central object interacting with increased fringing
fields near the edge of the plate, and attractive forces due primarily to the
nonzero thickness of the plate. In comparison with our previous work, we find
that using the same plate geometry but replacing the single cylinder with a
ring of cylinders, or more generally an extended uniaxial conductor, the
repulsive force can be enhanced by a factor of approximately $10^3$. We
conclude that this enhancement, although quite dramatic, is still too small to
yield detectable repulsive Casimir forces.

fluctuating service availability, where resources are available only some of
the time, and the schedule must dynamically respond to the changing available

of the system dynamics leads to important insights for stability, performance

there exists a motivic $t$-structure for the category of Voevodsky's
$S$-motives (as constructed by Cisinski and Deglise). If $S$ is 'very
reasonable' (for example, of finite type over a field) then the heart of this
$t$-structure (the category of mixed motivic sheaves over $S$) is endowed with
a weight filtration with semi-simple factors. We also prove a certain 'motivic
decomposition theorem' (assuming the conjectures mentioned) and characterize
semi-simple motivic sheaves over $S$ in terms of those over its residue fields.
Our main tool is the theory of weight structures. We actually prove somewhat
more than the existence of a weight filtration for mixed motivic sheaves: we
prove that the motivic $t$-structure is transversal to the Chow weight
structure for $S$-motives (that was introduced previously and independently by
D. Hebert and the author; weight structures and their transversality with
t-structures were also defined by the author in recent papers). We also deduce
several properties of mixed motivic sheaves from this fact. Our reasoning
relies on the degeneration of Chow-weight spectral sequences for 'perverse
'etale homology' (that we prove unconditionally); this statement also yields
the existence of the Chow-weight filtration for such (co)homology that is
strictly restricted by ('motivic') morphisms.

precise proper motions, which are unavailable for most MW satellites. Of the 4
satellites with published proper motions, only the Small Magellanic Cloud is
clearly associated with the LMC. Taken at face value, the proper motions of
Carina, Fornax and Sculptor rule them out as potential associates, but this
conclusion should be revisited when better data become available. The dearth of

CP, the observed CP is probably generated close to the event horizon by the
Faraday conversion process. We use a simple model to show that the phase shift

sufficient condition to make the handedness of CP independent of frequency.

some of their customers who are virtual service providers. These providers may
call for the connectivity service which fulfils the specificity of their
services, for instance a multicast transition with allocated bandwidth. On the
other hand, network operators want to make profit by trading the connectivity
service of requested quality to their customers and to limit their
infrastructure investments (or do not invest anything at all).
  We focus on circuit switching optical networks and work on repetitive
multicast demands whose source and destinations are {\em \`a priori} known by
an operator. He may therefore have corresponding trees ""ready to be allocated""
and adapt his network infrastructure according to these recurrent
transmissions. This adjustment consists in setting available branching routers
in the selected nodes of a predefined tree. The branching nodes are
opto-electronic nodes which are able to duplicate data and retransmit it in
several directions. These nodes are, however, more expensive and more energy
consuming than transparent ones.
  In this paper we are interested in the choice of nodes of a multicast tree
where the limited number of branching routers should be located in order to
minimize the amount of required bandwidth. After formally stating the problem
we solve it by proposing a polynomial algorithm whose optimality we prove. We
perform exhaustive computations to show an operator gain obtained by using our
algorithm. These computations are made for different methods of the multicast
tree construction. We conclude by giving dimensioning guidelines and outline

associated to a given path acts non trivially on spin network links that are
transversal to the path (a crossing). We provide an explicit construction of

along the line of sight. This noise is overcome when stacking clusters, as too
are the effects of cluster asphericity and substructure, permitting a stringent
test of theoretical models. We derive a mean radial mass profile of four
similar mass clusters of high-quality HST and Subaru images, in the range
R=40kpc/h to 2800kpc/h, where the inner radial boundary is sufficiently large
to avoid smoothing from miscentering effects. The stacked mass profile is
detected at 58-sigma significance over the entire radial range, with the
contribution from the cosmic noise included. We show that the projected mass
profile has a continuously steepening gradient out to beyond the virial radius,
in remarkably good agreement with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White form
predicted for the family of CDM-dominated halos in gravitational equilibrium.

  figures",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fitness effects of mutations fall on a continuum ranging from lethal to
deleterious to beneficial. The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among
random mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a
mathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species
all revealed a characteristic bimodal shaped DFE, featuring peaks at neutrality
and lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness
effects are still unknown, and presumably thought to vary unpredictably from
one mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a
simple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic
stability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects. We
assume that moderately destabilizing mutations inflict a fitness penalty
proportional to the reduction in folded protein, which depends continuously on
folding free energy (\Delta G). Most mutations in our model affect fitness by
altering \Delta G, while, based on simple estimates, \approx10% abolish
activity and are unconditionally lethal. Mutations pushing \Delta G>0 are also
considered lethal. Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in
mutation/selection/drift steady-state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less
stable proteins and a more dispersed DFE, i.e. less mutational robustness.
Small population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our
model, a continuum of non-lethal mutations reduces fitness by \approx2% on
average, while \approx10-35% of mutations are lethal, depending on N and m.
Compensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation
rates. More broadly, we conclude that interplay between biophysical and
population genetic forces shapes the DFE.

the VERITAS telescope array between 2008 and 2010, at energies above 300 GeV.
In the past, both ground-based gamma-ray telescopes VERITAS and MAGIC have
reported detections of TeV emission near the apastron phases of the binary
orbit. The observations presented here show no strong evidence for TeV emission
during these orbital phases; however, during observations taken in late 2010,
significant emission was detected from the source close to the phase of
superior conjunction (much closer to periastron passage) at a 5.6 standard
deviation (5.6 sigma) post-trials significance. In total, between October 2008
and December 2010 a total exposure of 64.5 hours was accumulated with VERITAS
on LS I +61 303, resulting in an excess at the 3.3 sigma significance level for
constant emission over the entire integrated dataset. The flux upper limits
derived for emission during the previously reliably active TeV phases (i.e.
close to apastron) are less than 5% of the Crab Nebula flux in the same energy
range. This result stands in apparent contrast to previous observations by both
MAGIC and VERITAS which detected the source during these phases at >10% of the
Crab Nebula flux. During the two year span of observations, a large amount of
X-ray data were also accrued on LS I +61 303 by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT)
and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Timing (RXTE) Proportional Counter Array
(PCA). We find no evidence for a correlation between emission in the X-ray and
TeV regimes during 20 directly overlapping observations. We also comment on
data obtained contemporaneously by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).

parametrization of the quark mixing matrix based on the triminimal expansion of
the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) parametrization. The CP-odd phase in the QM
parametrization is around $90^\circ$ just as that in the CKM parametrization.
We point out that the QM parametrization can be readily obtained from the
Wolfenstein parametrization after appropriate phase redefinition for quark
fields and that the phase $\delta$ in both QM and CKM parametrizations is
related to the unitarity angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, namely,
$\delta= \beta+\gamma$ or $\pi-\alpha$. We show that both QM and Wolfenstein
parametrizations can be deduced from the CKM and Chau-Keung-Maiani ones. By
deriving the QM parametrization from the Fritzsch-Xing (FX) parametrization of
the quark mixing matrix, we find that the phase of the FX form is in the
vicinity of $-270^\circ$ and hence $\sin\delta\approx 1$. We discuss the
seeming discrepancy between the Wolfenstein and QM parametrizations at the high
order of $\lambda\approx |V_{us}|$.

we place ourselves in the context of the globalizing parametrization which is

small, that is, for almost incompressible materials. To obtain a fixed error in
the phase velocity of Rayleigh surface waves as $\mu\to 0$, our analysis
predicts that the grid size must be proportional to $\mu^{1/2}$ for a second

$\mu^{1/4}$. Numerical experiments confirm this scaling and illustrate the
superior efficiency of the fourth order method.

solution of the Fokker-Planck equation delivers a simple expression for the
resulting probability density function (PDF) of the water vapour field and also
of the relative humidity. This solution agrees completely with a numerical
simulation of the process, and the humidity PDF exhibits several features of
interest, such as bimodality close to the source and unimodality further from
the source. The PDFs of specific and relative humidity are broad and
non-Gaussian. The domain averaged relative humidity PDF is bimodal with
distinct moist and dry peaks, a feature which we show agrees with middleworld
isentropic PDFs derived from the ERA interim dataset.

the accuracy of the solution and the computational cost. Moreover, We also show

spectrum sensing error aware MAC protocol for a CR network collocated with
multiple primary networks. We explicitly consider both types of sensing errors

with which secondary users collaboratively sense the licensed channels. The
sensing policies are then incorporated into p-Persistent CSMA to coordinate
opportunistic spectrum access for CR network users. We present an analysis of
the interference and throughput performance of the proposed CR MAC, and find
the analysis highly accurate in our simulation studies. The proposed sensing
error aware CR MAC protocol outperforms two existing approaches with
considerable margins in our simulations, which justify the importance of
considering spectrum sensing errors in CR MAC design.

The family generates the most general solutions to the Ward-Takahashi

family, chiral symmetry is realized in such a way that a change in the Wilson
action under non-linear symmetry transformation is canceled with a change in
the functional measure. We discuss that the family of solutions reduces via a
field redefinition to a family of the Wilson actions with some composite object
of the scalar fields which has a simple transformation property. For this
family, chiral symmetry is linearly realized with a continuum analog of the
operator extension of $\gamma_5$ used on the lattice. We also show that there
exist some appropriate Dirac fields which obey the standard chiral
transformations with $\gamma_5$ in contrast to the lattice case. Their Yukawa
interactions with scalars, however, becomes non-linear.

and composite galaxies. We used a sample of 89 379 galaxies with a good
signal-to-noise ratio from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (data release 7). Using
the classification scheme presented in Paper I, we classified these galaxies
with a diagnostic diagram involving the [Oiii]5007 /Hbeta and [Oii]3726+3729
/Hbeta emission-line ratios. Then we derived a supplementary diagnostic
involving Dn(4000) to improve this classification, in the regions where objects
of different types are mixed. To show the validity of our spectral
classification we established success-rate and contamination charts, then we
compared our results to those obtained with the reference classification that
was scheme obtained also using Halpha, [Nii]6584, and [Sii]6717+6731 emission
lines. We show that our supplementary classification based on the Dn(4000)
index allows to separate unambiguously star-forming galaxies from Seyfert 2 in
the region where they were mixed in Paper I. It also significantly reduces the
region where star-forming galaxies are mixed with composites.

value of the preferred boundary term in the covariant Hamiltonian formalism.
The boundary term depends upon a choice of reference and a time-like
displacement vector field (which can be associated with an observer) on the
boundary of the region. Here we analyze the spherical symmetric cases. For the
obvious analytic choice of reference based on the metric components, we find
that this technique gives the same quasi-local energy values using several
standard coordinate systems and yet can give different values in some other
coordinate systems. For the homogeneous-isotropic cosmologies, the energy can
be non-positive, and one case which is actually flat space has a negative
energy. As an alternative, we introduce a way to determine the choice of both
the reference and displacement by extremizing the energy. This procedure gives
the same value for the energy in different coordinate systems for the
Schwarzschild space, and a non-negative value for the cosmological models, with
zero energy for the dynamic cosmology which is actually Minkowski space. The
timelike displacement vector comes out to be the dual mean curvature vector of
the two-boundary.

we find the expected linear response behaviour as a function of their

inverse; interestingly, we find that a long memory of earlier outcomes can
occasionally compensate for the choice of a globally inferior strategy.

fraction at intermediate and high redshifts (0.2<z<0.8) is more dramatic in
groups of galaxies than in clusters. In order to understand the origin of S0s
in groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation of
spirals into S0s through group-related physical processes. Our chemodynamical
simulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influenced
by repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those with
thin disks and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into S0s with
thick disks and without prominent spiral arm structure. Such tidal interactions
can also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals and
consequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. Owing to rapid
consumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the S0s can
become gas-poor. The S0s transformed from spirals in this way have young and
metal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. The
simulated S0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radial
line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitor
spirals. The formation processes of S0s due to tidal interactions depend not
only on the masses and orbits of the progenitor spirals, but also on group
mass. A significant fraction (10-30%) of stars and gas can be stripped during
this spiral to S0 morphological transformation so that intragroup stars and gas
can be formed. Based on these results, we discuss structures, kinematics,
chemical properties, and the Tully-Fisher relation of S0s in groups.

dynamics are commonly studied in short-term clinical trials with frequent data
collection design. For example, the elimination process of plasma virus during

accomplished using a fully Bayesian approach. Doubly interval-censored data are

compare Fourier-space shell-to-shell energy transfer rates of three

simulation driven by random flow, a simulation of Boussinesq convection, and a
simulation of fully compressible convection that includes physics relevant to
the near-surface layers of the Sun. For each of the simulations studied, we
find that the dynamo mechanism is universal in the kinematic regime because
energy is transferred from the turbulent flow to the magnetic field from
wavenumbers in the inertial range of the energy spectrum. The addition of
physical effects relevant to the solar near-surface layers, including
stratification, compressibility, partial ionization, and radiative energy
transport, does not appear to affect the nature of the dynamo mechanism. The
role of inertial-range shear stresses in magnetic field amplification is
independent from outer-scale circumstances, including forcing and
stratification. Although the shell-to-shell energy transfer functions have
similar properties to those seen in mean-flow driven dynamos in each simulation
studied, the saturated states of these simulations are not universal because
the flow at the driving wavenumbers is a significant source of energy for the
magnetic field.

semantics, and web-scalable implementations. Due to a careful choice of
representational primitives, MMT allows us to integrate existing representation
languages for formal mathematical knowledge in a simple, scalable formalism. In
particular, MMT abstracts from the underlying mathematical and logical
foundations so that it can serve as a standardized representation format for a
formal digital library. Moreover, MMT systematically separates logic-dependent

linear polarization, as well as changes in Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)

events at different wavebands is confirmed at high statistical significance by
probability arguments and Monte-Carlo simulations. A series of sharp peaks in
optical linear polarization, as well as a pronounced maximum in the 7 mm
polarization of a superluminal jet knot, indicate rapid fluctuations in the
degree of ordering of the magnetic field. These results lead us to conclude
that the outburst occurred in the jet both in the quasi-stationary ""core"" and
in the superluminal knot, both parsecs downstream of the supermassive black
hole. We interpret the outburst as a consequence of the propagation of a
disturbance, elongated along the line of sight by light-travel time delays,
that passes through a standing recollimation shock in the core and propagates
down the jet to create the superluminal knot. The multi-wavelength light curves
vary together on long time-scales (months/years), but the correspondence is
poorer on shorter time-scales. This, as well as the variability of the
polarization and the dual location of the outburst, agrees with the
expectations of a multi-zone emission model in which turbulence plays a major
role in modulating the synchrotron and inverse Compton fluxes.

flux supports the idea that photoevaporation of the atmosphere may take place
in close-in planets. Integrated effects have to be accounted for. A proper
calculation of the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation requires to estimate
the total irradiation from the whole XUV range. Aims: The purpose of this paper
is to extend the analysis of the photoevaporation in planetary atmospheres from
the accessible X-rays to the mostly unobserved EUV range by using the coronal
models of stars to calculate the EUV contribution to the stellar spectra. The
mass evolution of planets can be traced assuming that thermal losses dominate
the mass loss of their atmospheres. Methods: We determine coronal models for 82
stars with exoplanets that have X-ray observations available. Then a synthetic
spectrum is produced for the whole XUV range (~1-912 {\AA}). The determination
of the EUV stellar flux, calibrated with real EUV data, allows us to calculate
the accumulated effects of the XUV irradiation on the planet atmosphere with
time, as well as the mass evolution for planets with known density. Results: We
calibrate for the first time a relation of the EUV luminosity with stellar age
valid for late-type stars. In a sample of 109 exoplanets, few planets with
masses larger than ~1.5 Mj receive high XUV flux, suggesting that intense
photoevaporation takes place in a short period of time, as previously found in
X-rays. The scenario is also consistent with the observed distribution of
planet masses with density. The accumulated effects of photoevaporation over
time indicate that HD 209458b may have lost 0.2 Mj since an age of 20 Myr.
Conclusions: Coronal radiation produces rapid photoevaporation of the
atmospheres of planets close to young late-type stars. More complex models are
needed to explain fully the observations.

systolic geometry was recently studied by Horowitz, Katz, and Katz, where we
obtained a strengthening of Loewner's torus inequality containing a ""defect

Here the analogous isosystolic defect term depends on the metric and ""measures""
its deviation from being flat. Namely, the defect is the variance of the
function f which appears as the conformal factor expressing the metric on the
torus as f^2(x,y)(dx^2+dy^2), in terms of the flat unit-area metric in its
conformal class. A key tool turns out to be the computational formula for
probabilistic variance, which is a kind of a sharpened version of the

At variance the critical chemical potentials (at zero temperature) are very

We present Monte Carlo mass-loss predictions for very massive stars in the
range 40-300 Msun, with large luminosities and Eddington factors Gamma. Using
our new dynamical approach, we find an upturn in the mass-loss vs. Gamma
dependence, at the point where the winds become optically thick. This coincides
with the location where wind efficiency numbers surpass the single-scattering
limit of Eta = 1, reaching values up to Eta = 2.5. Our modelling suggests a
transition from common O-type winds to Wolf-Rayet characteristics at the point
where the winds become optically thick. This transitional behaviour is also
revealed with respect to the wind acceleration parameter beta, which starts at
values below 1 for the optically thin O-stars, and naturally reaches values as
high as 1.5-2 for the optically thick Wolf-Rayet models. An additional finding
concerns the transition in spectral morphology of the Of and WN characteristic
He II line at 4686 Angstrom. When we express our mass-loss predictions as a
function of the electron scattering Gamma_e (=L/M) only, we obtain a mass-loss
Gamma dependence that is consistent with a previously reported power-law Mdot
propto Gamma^5 (Vink 2006) that was based on our semi-empirical modelling
approach. When we express Mdot in terms of both Gamma and stellar mass, we find
Mdot propto M^0.8 Gamma^4.8 for our high Gamma models. Finally, we confirm that
the Gamma-effect on the mass-loss predictions is much stronger than that of an
increased helium abundance, calling for a fundamental revision in the way mass

temperatures $T\ll T_K$, the standard interpretation is that a
spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ impurity is screened by a surrounding `Kondo cloud' of
spatial extent $\xi_K$. We argue that renormalization group (RG) flow between
any two fixed points (FPs) results in a characteristic length-scale, observed
in real-space as a crossover between physical behaviour typical of each FP. In
the simplest example of the Anderson impurity model, three FPs arise; and we
show that `free orbital', `local moment' and `strong coupling' regions of space
can be identified at zero temperature. These regions are separated by two
crossover length-scales $\xi_{\text{LM}}$ and $\xi_K$, with the latter
diverging as the Kondo effect is destroyed on increasing temperature through
$T_K$. One implication is that moment formation occurs inside the `Kondo
cloud', while the screening process itself occurs on flowing to the strong
coupling FP at distances $\sim \xi_K$. Generic aspects of the real-space
physics are exemplified by the two-channel Kondo model, where $\xi_K$ now
separates `local moment' and `overscreening' clouds.

methods, which may require $10^{3-6}$ runs cannot be used directly. Surrogate
models such as quadratic response surfaces, polynomial chaos expansions or
kriging (which are built from a limited number of runs of the original model)
are then introduced as a substitute of the original model to cope with the
computational cost. In practice it is almost impossible to quantify the error
made by this substitution though. In this paper we propose to use a kriging
surrogate of the performance function as a means to build a quasi-optimal
importance sampling density. The probability of failure is eventually obtained
as the product of an augmented probability computed by substituting the
meta-model for the original performance function and a correction term which
ensures that there is no bias in the estimation even if the meta-model is not

Generally, the
number of spanning trees in a network can be obtained by computing a related
determinant of the Laplacian matrix of the network. However, for a large
generic network, evaluating the relevant determinant is computationally
intractable. In this paper, we develop a fairly generic technique for computing
determinants corresponding to self-similar networks, thereby providing a method
to determine the numbers of spanning trees in networks exhibiting
self-similarity. We describe the computation process with a family of networks,
called $(x,y)$-flowers, which display rich behavior as observed in a large
variety of real systems. The enumeration of spanning trees is based on the
relationship between the determinants of submatrices of the Laplacian matrix
corresponding to the $(x,y)$-flowers at different generations and is devoid of
the direct laborious computation of determinants. Using the proposed method, we
derive analytically the exact number of spanning trees in the $(x,y)$-flowers,
on the basis of which we also obtain the entropies of the spanning trees in
these networks. Moreover, to illustrate the universality of our technique, we
apply it to some other self-similar networks with distinct degree
distributions, and obtain explicit solutions to the numbers of spanning trees
and their entropies. Finally, we compare our results for networks with the same
average degree but different structural properties, such as degree distribution
and fractal dimension, and uncover the effect of these topological features on
the number of spanning trees.

to a given hub node (node with maximum degree) averaged over all starting
points in scale-free small-world networks exhibits a sublinear or linear
dependence on network order $N$ (number of nodes), which indicates that hub
nodes are very efficient in receiving information if one looks upon the random
walker as an information messenger. Thus far, the efficiency of a hub node
sending information on scale-free small-world networks has not been addressed
yet. In this paper, we study random walks on the class of Koch networks with
scale-free behavior and small-world effect. We derive some basic properties for
random walks on the Koch network family, based on which we calculate
analytically the partial mean first-passage time (PMFPT) defined as the average
of MFPTs from a hub node to all other nodes, excluding the hub itself. The
obtained closed-form expression displays that in large networks the PMFPT grows
with network order as $N \ln N$, which is larger than the linear scaling of
SMFPT to the hub from other nodes. On the other hand, we also address the case
with the information sender distributed uniformly among the Koch networks, and
derive analytically the entire mean first-passage time (EMFPT), namely, the
average of MFPTs between all couples of nodes, the leading scaling of which is
identical to that of PMFPT. From the obtained results, we present that although
hub nodes are more efficient for receiving information than other nodes, they
display a qualitatively similar speed for sending information as non-hub nodes.
Moreover, we show that the location of information sender has little effect on
the transmission efficiency. The present findings are helpful for better
understanding random walks performed on scale-free small-world networks.

observations were made during 2011 January 30 - February 3 using
photo-polarimeter mounted at the 1.2m telescope of Mt Abu InfraRed

0.41%$ degree of polarization (DP) with steady position angle (PA) at
43$^\circ$ on 2011 January 30. During Jan 31 and Feb 1, while polarization
shows some variation, position angle remains steady for the night. Several
olarization flashes occurred during February 2 and 3 resulting in changes in
the DP by more than 4% at short time scales ($\sim$ 17 to 45 mins). A mild
increase in the linear polarization with frequency is noticed during the nights
of February 2 & 3. The source exhibited significant inter-night variations in
the degree of polarization (changed by about 2 to 9%) and position angle
(changed by 2 to 22$^\circ$) during the five nights of observations. The
intra-night activity shown by the source appears to be related to turbulence in
the relativistic jet. Sudden change in the PA accompanied by a rise in the DP
could be indicative of the fresh injection of electrons in the jet. The
detection of high and variable degree of polarization categorizes the source as
low energy peaked blazar.

high-redshift quasars in a cosmological environment. In a box of 64 h-1 Mpc
base length we employ dark matter only simulations. For estimating the hydrogen
temperature and density distribution we use the effective equation of state.
Hydrogen is assumed to be in photoionisation equilibrium with a model
background flux which is fit to recent observations of the mean optical depth
and transmission flux statistics. At redshifts z = 3, 4, and 4.8, we select
model quasar positions at the centre of the 20 most massive halos and 100 less
massive halos identified in the simulation. From each assumed quasar position
we cast 100 random lines of sight for two box length including the changes in
the ionisation fractions by the QSO flux field and derive mock Ly{\alpha}
spectra. The proximity effect describes the dependence of the mean normalised
optical depth {\xi} = {\tau}eff, QSO/{\tau}eff, Ly{\alpha} as a function of the
ratio of the ionisation rate by the QSO and the background field, {\omega} =
{\Gamma}QSO/{\Gamma}UVB, i.e. the profile {\xi} = (1 + {\omega}/a)-0.5, where a
strength parameter a is introduced. The strength parameter measures the
deviation from the theoretical background model and is used to quantify any
influence of the environmental density field. We reproduce an unbiased
measurement of the proximity effect which is not affected by the host halo
mass. The scatter between different lines of sight and different quasar host
positions increases with decreasing redshift. Around the host halos, we find
only a slight average overdensity in the proximity zone at comoving radii of 1
< rc < 10h-1 Mpc. However, a clear power-law correlation of the strength
parameter with the average overdensity in rc is found, showing an
overestimation of the ionising background in overdense regions and an
underestimation in underdense regions.

illustrating the mechanisms by which the fractal patterns can be generated from
central place systems. The structural dimension of the traditional central
place models is d=2 indicating no intermittency in the spatial distribution of
human settlements. This dimension value is inconsistent with empirical
observations. Substituting the complete space filling with the incomplete space
filling, we can obtain central place models with fractional dimension D<d=2
indicative of spatial intermittency. Thus the conventional central place models
are converted into fractal central place models. If we further integrate the
chance factors into the improved central place fractals, the theory will be
able to well explain the real patterns of urban places. As empirical analyses,
the US cities and towns are employed to verify the fractal-based models of

temperature of the WD atmosphere seems to increase at the beginning of the SSS
phase from ~70 to ~80 eV. The luminosity of M31N 2007-12b during maximum was at
the Eddington limit of a massive WD and dropped by ~30% in the observation 60 d
after outburst. The radius of the emission region is ~6x10^8 cm. In the four
bright state observations, we detected a stable 1110 s pulsation, which we
interpret as the WD rotation period. In addition, we detect dips in three
observations that might represent a 4.9 h or 9.8 h binary period of the system.
Nova envelope models with <50% mixing between solar-like accreted material and
the degenerate core of the WD can be used to describe the data. We derive a WD
mass of 1.2 Msun, as well as an ejected and burned mass of 2.0x10^{-6} Msun}

centre of a cool-core group or cluster of galaxies is immersed in hot gas.
Bondi accretion should occur at a rate determined by the properties of the gas
at the Bondi radius and the mass of the black hole. X-ray observations of
massive nearby elliptical galaxies, including M87 in the Virgo cluster,
indicate a Bondi accretion rate Mdot which roughly matches the total kinetic
power of the jets, suggesting that there is a tight coupling between the jet
power and the mass accretion rate. While the Bondi model considers non-rotating
gas, it is likely that the external gas has some angular momentum, which
previous studies have shown could decrease the accretion rate drastically. We
investigate here the possibility that viscosity acts at all radii to transport
angular momentum outward so that the accretion inflow proceeds rapidly and
steadily. The situation corresponds to a giant Advection Dominated Accretion
Flow (ADAF) which extends from beyond the Bondi radius down to the black hole.
We find solutions of the ADAF equations in which the gas accretes at just a
factor of a few less than Mdot. These solutions assume that the atmosphere
beyond the Bondi radius rotates with a sub-Keplerian velocity and that the
viscosity parameter is large, alpha~0.1. The infall time of the ADAF solutions
is no more than a few times the free-fall time. Thus the accretion rate at the
black hole is closely coupled to the surrounding gas, enabling tight feedback
to occur. We show that jet powers of a few per cent of Mdot c^2 are expected if
either a fraction of the accretion power is channeled into the jet or the black
hole spin energy is tapped by a strong magnetic field pressed against the black
hole by the pressure of the accretion flow.(Truncated)

(1) optically-selected members with rest-frame V(AB) magnitude <-21.5 and (2)
mid-IR selected members brighter than (M*+0.5), i.e. essentially a stellar mass
cut. In both samples, we measure \agnfrac ~1% with a strong upper limit of ~3%
at z<1. This uniformly low IR-AGN fraction at z<1 is surprising given the
fraction of 24 micron sources in the same galaxy clusters is observed to
increase by about a factor of four from z~0 to z~1; this indicates that most of
the detected 24 micron flux is due to star formation. Only in our single galaxy
cluster at z=1.24 is the IR-AGN fraction measurably higher at ~15% (all
members; ~70% for late-types only). In agreement with recent studies, we find
the cluster IR-AGN are predominantly hosted by late-type galaxies with blue
optical colors, i.e. members with recent/ongoing star formation. The four
brightest IR-AGN are also X-ray sources; these IR+X-ray AGN all lie outside the
cluster core (Rproj>0.5 Mpc) and are hosted by highly morphologically disturbed
members. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that \agnfrac in
massive galaxy clusters is not strongly correlated with star formation at z<1,

spectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. One of
the key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic
oscillations in the distribution of Ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of a
sample of ~150,000 z>2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter
distance at z\approx2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the
expansion rate of the Universe at z > 2. One of the biggest challenges in
achieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over
2.2 < z < 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. During the first year
of the BOSS survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and tested
to meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in this
redshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. To achieve these surface densities,
the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g <= 22.0 or r<=21.85.
While detection of the BAO signature in the Ly-alpha absorption in quasar
spectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysical
studies do. We therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targets
deg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. This ""CORE""
subsample will be fixed for Years Two through Five of the survey. In this paper
we describe the evolution and implementation of the BOSS quasar target
selection algorithms during the first two years of BOSS operations. We analyze
the spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z>2.2 quasars were
spectroscopically confirmed by BOSS. Our current algorithms select an average
of 15 z > 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch SDSS
imaging. Multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can further
improve the efficiency and completeness of BOSS quasar target selection.

many-body excitations) in a weakly interacting Bose gas of chemical potential
$\mu$ subjected to a disordered potential $V$. We introduce a general mapping
(valid for weak inhomogeneous potentials in any dimension) of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations onto a single-particle Schr\""odinger-like equation with an
effective potential. For disordered potentials, the Schr\""odinger-like equation
accounts for the scattering and localization properties of the Bogoliubov
quasiparticles. We derive analytically the localization lengths for correlated
disordered potentials in the one-dimensional geometry. Our approach relies on a
perturbative expansion in $V/\mu$, which we develop up to third order, and we
discuss the impact of the various perturbation orders. Our predictions are
shown to be in very good agreement with direct numerical calculations. We
identify different localization regimes: For low energy, the effective
disordered potential exhibits a strong screening by the quasicondensate density
background, and localization is suppressed. For high-energy excitations, the
effective disordered potential reduces to the bare disordered potential, and
the localization properties of quasiparticles are the same as for free
particles. The maximum of localization is found at intermediate energy when the
quasicondensate healing length is of the order of the disorder correlation
length. Possible extensions of our work to higher dimensions are also
discussed.

Schur function S with the constraint that the extension is of size 2p x 2p.
Under the assumption that S is strictly contractive in at least one point of
the imaginary axis, we determine the minimal McMillan degree of the extension.
In particular, we show that it is generically given by the number of zeros of
odd multiplicity of I-SS*. A constructive characterization of all such
extensions is provided in terms of a symmetric realization of S and of the
outer spectral factor of I-SS*. The authors's motivation for the problem stems
from Surface Acoustic Wave filters where physical constraints on the
electro-acoustic scattering matrix naturally raise this mathematical issue.

supergravity. This is obtained by considering a stack of D3-branes in type IIB
supergravity and deforming the world-volume by a plane wave. The plane wave is
sourced by the type IIB axion. The superposition of the plane wave and the
D3-branes is 1/4 BPS. The near horizon geometry of this configuration is a
5-dimensional z=0 Schroedinger space-time times a 5-sphere. This geometry is
also 1/4 BPS. Upon compactification along the direction in which the wave is
traveling the 5-dimensional z=0 Schroedinger space-time reduces to a
4-dimensional z=2 Lifshitz space-time. The compactification is such that the
circle is small for weakly coupled type IIB string theory. This reduction
breaks the supersymmetries. Further, we propose a general method to construct
analytic z=2 Lifshitz black brane solutions. The method is based on deforming
5-dimensional AdS black strings by an axion wave and reducing to 4-dimensions.
We illustrate this method with an example.

$d\ge 2$) with sides of length $\ell_1,..., \ell_n$, viewed up to translations.
The spaces $E_d(\ell)$ are parameterized by their length vectors
$\ell=(\ell_1,..., \ell_n)\in \R^n_{>}$ encoding the length parameters.
Generically, $E_{d}(\ell)$ is a closed smooth manifold of dimension
$(n-1)(d-1)-1$ supporting an obvious action of the orthogonal group ${O}(d)$.
However, the quotient space $E_{d}(\ell)/{O}(d)$ (the moduli space of shapes of
$n$-gons) has singularities for a generic $\ell$, assuming that $d>3$; this
quotient is well understood in the low dimensional cases $d=2$ and $d=3$. Our
main result in this paper states that for fixed $d\ge 3$ and $n\ge 3$, the
diffeomorphism types of the manifolds $E_{d}(\ell)$ for varying generic vectors
$\ell$ are in one-to-one correspondence with some combinatorial objects --
connected components of the complement of a finite collection of hyperplanes.
This result is in the spirit of a conjecture of K. Walker who raised a similar
problem in the planar case $d=2$.

subsonically, at higher stress their speed abruptly increased to 1.9 times the
speed of shear waves, then slowly grew with stress. There is evidence that
immediately after nucleation dislocations can move faster than pressure waves.

much more difficult than anticipated, mainly because the morphological,

indeed. Here I focus on recent results and touch upon the bright near future of
