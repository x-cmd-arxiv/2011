of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays spectrum at (1 - 3) EeV and a steadily heavier
composition with energy increasing. In order to explain this feature we assume
that (1 - 3) EeV protons are extragalactic and derive their maximum
acceleration energy, E_p^{max} \simeq 4 EeV, compatible with both the spectrum
and the composition. We also assume the rigidity-dependent acceleration
mechanism of heavier nuclei, E_A^{max} = Z x E_p^{max}. The proposed model has
rather disappointing consequences: i) no pion photo-production on CMB photons
in extragalactic space and hence ii) no high-energy cosmogenic neutrino fluxes;
iii) no GZK-cutoff in the spectrum; iv) no correlation with nearby sources due
to nuclei deflection in the galactic magnetic fields up to highest energies.

Stabilization occurs through the coupling to a heavy fermion doublet in a
reduced version of the standard model. We combine the vacuum polarization
energy of fermion zero-point fluctuations and the binding energy of occupied
energy levels, which are of the same order in a semi-classical expansion.
Populating these bound states assigns a charge to the string. We show that
strings carrying fermion charge become stable if the electro-weak bosons are
coupled to a fermion that is less than twice as heavy as the top quark. The
vacuum remains stable in our model, because neutral strings are not
energetically favored. These findings suggests that extraordinarily large
fermion masses or unrealistic couplings are not required to bind a cosmic
string in the standard model.

factors, on social interactions with other group members. Our present
understanding of social rules in animal collectives is mainly based on
empirical fits to observations, with less emphasis in obtaining
first-principles approaches that allow their derivation. Here we show that
patterns of collective decisions can be derived from the basic ability of
animals to make probabilistic estimations in the presence of uncertainty. We
build a decision-making model with two stages: Bayesian estimation and
probabilistic matching. In the first stage, each animal makes a Bayesian
estimation of which behavior is best to perform taking into account personal
information about the environment and social information collected by observing
the behaviors of other animals. In the probability matching stage, each animal
chooses a behavior with a probability equal to the Bayesian-estimated
probability that this behavior is the most appropriate one. This model derives
very simple rules of interaction in animal collectives that depend only on two
types of reliability parameters, one that each animal assigns to the other
animals and another given by the quality of the non-social information. We test
our model by obtaining theoretically a rich set of observed collective patterns
of decisions in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a shoaling
fish species. The quantitative link shown between probabilistic estimation and
collective rules of behavior allows a better contact with other fields such as
foraging, mate selection, neurobiology and psychology, and gives predictions
for experiments directly testing the relationship between estimation and

particularly, the magnetic twists B_{\phi}/B_z=0.0065 and 0.0255 can achieve
deviations from 2 of the same order of magnitude as in the observations.

very high redshift, Gamma Rays Bursts (GRBs) have recently attracted a lot of
interest to probe the Hubble diagram (HD) deep into the matter dominated era
and hence complement Type Ia Supernoave (SNeIa). However, lacking a local GRBs
sample, calibrating the scaling relations proposed as an equivalent to the
Phillips law to standardize GRBs is not an easy task because of the need to
estimate the GRBs luminosity distance in a model independent way. We consider
here three different calibration methods based on the use of a fiducial
$\Lambda$CDM model, on cosmographic parameters and on the local regression on
SNeIa. We find that the calibration coefficients and the intrinsic scatter do
not significantly depend on the adopted calibration procedure. We then
investigate the evolution of these parameters with the redshift finding no
statistically motivated improvement in the likelihood so that the no evolution
assumption is actually a well founded working hypothesis. Under this
assumption, we then consider possible systematics effects on the HDs introduced
by the calibration method, the averaging procedure and the homogeneity of the
sample arguing against any significant bias. We nevertheless stress that a
larger GRBs sample with smaller uncertainties is needed to definitely conclude
that the different systematics considered here have indeed a negligible impact
on the HDs thus strengthening the use of GRBs as cosmological tools.

decade has focused on massive, luminous starburst galaxies (submm galaxies and
AGN host galaxies). The far infrared luminosities are ~ 1e13 Lsun, implying
star formation rates, SFR > 1e3 Msun/year. Molecular gas reservoirs are found
with masses: M(H_2) > 1e10 (alpha/0.8}) Msun. The CO excitation in these
luminous systems is much higher than in low redshift spiral galaxies. Imaging
of the gas distribution and dynamics suggests strongly interacting and merging
galaxies, indicating gravitationally induced, short duration (~ 1e7 year)
starbursts. These systems correspond to a major star formation episode in
massive galaxies in proto-clusters at intermediate to high redshift. Recently,
radio observations have probed the more typical star forming galaxy population
(SFR ~ 100 Msun/year), during the peak epoch of Universal star formation (z ~
1.5 to 2.5). These observations reveal massive gas reservoirs without
hyper-starbursts, and show that active star formation occurs over a wide range
in galaxy stellar mass. The conditions in this gas are comparable to those
found in the Milky Way disk. A key result is that the peak epoch of star
formation in the Universe also corresponds to an epoch when the baryon content
of star forming galaxies was dominated by molecular gas, not stars. We consider
the possibility of tracing out the dense gas history of the Universe, and
perform initial, admittedly gross, calculations. ABRIDGED

vacancy using a combination of the density-functional, tight-binding, and
impurity Green's function approaches. Density functional studies are performed
with the all-electron spin-polarized linear augmented plane wave (LAPW) method.
The three $sp^2 \sigma$ dangling bonds adjacent to the vacancy introduce
localized states (V$\sigma$) in the mid-gap region, which split due to the
crystal field and a Jahn-Teller distortion, while the $p_z \pi$ states
introduce a sharp resonance state (V$\pi$) in the band structure. For a planar
structure, symmetry strictly forbids hybridization between the $\sigma$ and the
$\pi$ states, so that these bands are clearly identifiable in the calculated
band structure. As for the magnetic moment of the vacancy, the Hund's-rule
coupling aligns the spins of the four localized V$\sigma_1 \uparrow
\downarrow$, V$\sigma_2 \uparrow $, and the V$\pi \uparrow$ electrons resulting
in a S=1 state, with a magnetic moment of $2 \mu_B$, which is reduced by about
$0.3 \mu_B$ due to the anti-ferromagnetic spin-polarization of the $\pi$ band
itinerant states in the vicinity of the vacancy. This results in the net
magnetic moment of $1.7 \mu_B$. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we
reproduce the well-known $\sim 1/r$ decay of the localized V$\pi$ wave function
with distance and in addition find an interference term coming from the two
Dirac points, previously unnoticed in the literature. The long-range nature of
the V$\pi$ wave function is a unique feature of the graphene vacancy and we
suggest that this may be one of the reasons for the widely varying relaxed
structures and magnetic moments reported from the supercell band calculations

collapse supernovae (SNe) is based on the dominance of the neutrino density
n_nu over the net electron density n_e. However, this condition is not met
during the post-bounce accretion phase, when the dense matter in a SN is piled
up above the neutrinosphere. As recently pointed-out, a dominant matter term in
the anisotropic SN environment would dephase the flavor evolution for neutrinos
traveling on different trajectories, challenging the occurrence of the
collective behavior in the dense neutrino gas. Using the results from recent
long term simulations of core-collapse SN explosions, based on three flavor
Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry, we find that both the
situations of complete matter suppression (when n_e >> n_nu) and matter-induced
decoherence (when n_e \gtrsim n_nu) of flavor conversions are realized during
the accretion phase. The matter suppression at high densities prevents any
possible impact of the neutrino oscillations on the neutrino heating and hence
on the dynamics of the explosion. Furthermore, it changes the interpretation of
the Earth matter effect on the SN neutrino signal during the accretion phase,
allowing the possibility of the neutrino mass hierarchy discrimination at not
too small values of the leptonic mixing angle \theta_{13} (i.e.
\sin^2{\theta}_{13} \gtrsim 10^{-3}).

applications such as: the scalar elliptic (pressure) equation and the stream

constant in the corresponding abstract energy estimate is shown to be robust
with respect to mesh parameters as well as the contrast, which is defined as
the ratio of high and low values of the conductivity (or permeability). The
derived stable decomposition allows to construct additive overlapping Schwarz
iterative methods with condition numbers uniformly bounded with respect to the
contrast and mesh parameters. The coarse spaces are obtained by patching
together the eigenfunctions corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues of
certain local problems. A detailed analysis of the abstract setting is
provided. The proposed decomposition builds on a method of Efendiev and Galvis,

discretizations of the second order elliptic problem in Galerkin and mixed

with that of a fixed disk under the action of a parallel magnetic field,

different from the iron pnictides, where the NN magnetic exchange coupling is

temperature change and ocean heat gain together constrain the net climate
forcing and ocean mixing rates. We conclude that most climate models mix heat
too efficiently into the deep ocean and as a result underestimate the negative
forcing by human-made aerosols. Aerosol climate forcing today is inferred to be
1.6 \pm 0.3 W/m2, implying substantial aerosol indirect climate forcing via
cloud changes. Continued failure to quantify the specific origins of this large
forcing is untenable, as knowledge of changing aerosol effects is needed to
understand future climate change. We conclude that recent slowdown of ocean
heat uptake was caused by a delayed rebound effect from Mount Pinatubo aerosols
and a deep prolonged solar minimum. Observed sea level rise during the Argo

the ascendency of ice melt leads us to anticipate acceleration of the rate of

scaling up of these methods and techniques to achieve large scale universal

easily controllable and stable microwave sources instead of complex laser
systems on the other hand promises to remove obstacles to scalability.
Important remaining drawbacks in this approach are the use of magnetic field
sensitive states, which shorten coherence times considerably, and the
requirement to create large stable magnetic field gradients. Here, we present
theoretically a novel approach based on dressing magnetic field sensitive
states with microwave fields which addresses both issues and permits fast
quantum logic. We experimentally demonstrate basic building blocks of this
scheme to show that these dressed states are long-lived and coherence times are
increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to bare magnetic field
sensitive states. This changes decisively the prospect of microwave-driven ion
trap QIP and offers a new route to extend coherence times for all systems that

unconditionally energy stable and uniquely solvable at each time step. We then
show that, using the compactness method, the finite element solution has an
accumulation point that is a weak solution of the PDE system. As a result, the
convergence result also provides a constructive proof of the existence of
global-in-time weak solutions to the Darcy-Cahn-Hilliard phase field model in

  The Halpha emission line was strongly detected in all sources. Two components
-- a very broad (>~5000 km/s) Gaussian and an intermediate-width (>~1500 km/s)
Gaussian, were required to fit the Halpha profile of all observed QSOs. Narrow
(<~1000 km/s) lines were not detected in the sample QSOs.
  Relative to the Halpha-derived QSO redshift, the rest-frame UV emission lines
in these sub-mm bright QSOs show larger than average blue-shifted velocities,
potentially tracing strong -- up to 3000 km/s -- outflows in the Broad Line
Region.
  With the exception of the one QSO which shows exceptionally broad Halpha
lines, the black hole masses of the QSO sample are in the range log Mbh =
9.0--9.7 and the Eddington fractions are between 0.5 and ~1. In black hole mass
and accretion rate, this sub-mm bright QSO sample is indistinguishable from the
Shemmer et al. (2004) optically-bright QSO sample at z~2; the latter is likely
dominated by sub-mm dim QSOs. Previous authors have demonstrated a correlation,
over six orders of magnitude, between SFR and accretion rate in active
galaxies: the sub-mm bright QSOs lie at the upper extremes of both quantities
and their SFR is an order of magnitude higher than that predicted from the

angular momentum loss drives CVs to initially evolve from longer to shorter
orbital periods until a minimum period is reached (\approx 80 min). At roughly
this stage, the donors becomes degenerate, expand in size, and the systems move
towards longer Porb. Theory predicts that 70% of all CVs should have passed
their minimum period and have sub-stellar donors, but until recently, no such
systems were known. I present one CV showing evidence of harbouring a sub-dwarf
donor, SDSS J1507+52. Due to the system's unusually short Porb of about 65 min,
and very high space velocity, two origins for SDSS J1507+52 have been proposed;
either the system was formed from a young WD/brown-dwarf binary, or the system
is a halo CV. In order to distinguish between these two theories, I present UV
spectroscopy and find a metallicity consistent with halo origin. Systems close
to Pmin are expected to have low accretion rates. Some of these CVs show
absorption in their spectra, implying that the underlying WD is exposed. This
yields a rare opportunity to study the WD in a CV. I introduce two new systems
showing WD signatures in their light curves and spectra, SDSS J1457+51 and BW
Scl. Despite the fact that CVs close to Pmin should be faint, we find systems
that are much too bright for their Porb. Such a system is T Pyx - a recurrent
nova with an unusually high accretion rate and a photometrically determined
Porb < 2 hr. T Pyx is about 2 times brighter than any other CV at its period.
However, to confirm its evolutionary status, a more reliable period
determination is needed. Here, I present a spectroscopic study, confirming T
Pyx as a short-period CV. In this thesis, I discuss what implications these
systems may have on the current understanding of CV evolution, and the
importance of studying individual systems in general.

revealed that the directions in which Voigt waves propagate is highly sensitive
to the orientation of the component particles and to the volume fraction of the

effective mechanism to capture Triton. The subsequent evolution of Triton's
post-capture orbit could have proceeded through gravitational tides. The study
by Agnor & Hamilton (2006) is repeated in the framework of the Nice model to
determine the post-capture orbit of Triton. After capture it is then subjected
to tidal evolution. The perturbations from the Sun and the figure of Neptune
are included. The perturbations from the Sun acting on Triton cause it to spend
a long time in its high-eccentricity phase, usually of the order of 10 Myr,
while the typical time to circularise to its current orbit is some 200 Myr. The
current orbit of Triton is consistent with an origin through binary capture and
tidal evolution, even though the model prefers Triton to be closer to Neptune
than it is today. The probability of capturing Triton in this manner is
approximately 0.7%. Since the capture of Triton was at most a 50% event --
since only Neptune has one, but Uranus does not -- we deduce that in the
primordial trans-Neptunian disc there were 100 binaries with at least one
Triton-sized member. Morbidelli et al. (2009) concludes there were some 1000
Triton-sized bodies in the trans-Neptunian proto-planetary disc, so the
primordial binary fraction with at least one Triton-sized member is 10%. This
value is consistent with theoretical predictions, but at the low end. If Triton
was captured at the same time as Neptune's irregular satellites, the far
majority of these, including Nereid, would be lost. This suggests either that
Triton was captured on an orbit with a small semi-major axis a < 50 R_N (a rare
event), or that it was captured before the dynamical instability of the Nice
model, or that some other mechanism was at play. The issue of keeping the
irregular satellites remains unresolved.

Dirichlet to Neumann map. The approximations are Dirichlet to Neumann maps of
special resistor networks, that are uniquely recoverable from the measurements.
Inversion on optimal grids has been proposed and analyzed recently, but the
study of noise effects on the inversion has not been carried out. In this paper
we present a numerical study of both the linearized and the nonlinear inverse
problem. We take three different parametrizations of the unknown conductivity,
with the same number of degrees of freedom. We obtain that the parametrization
induced by the inversion on optimal grids is the most efficient of the three,
because it gives the smallest standard deviation of the maximum a posteriori
estimates of the conductivity, uniformly in the domain. For the nonlinear
problem we compute the mean and variance of the maximum a posteriori estimates
of the conductivity, on optimal grids. For small noise, we obtain that the
estimates are unbiased and their variance is very close to the optimal one,
given by the Cramer-Rao bound. For larger noise we use regularization and
quantify the trade-off between reducing the variance and introducing bias in
the solution. Both the full and partial measurement setups are considered.

of dimer of eicosane molecules has two well ordered helical hairpins that are
stacked perpendicular to each other. As a prelude to studying folding in
confined spaces we used simulations to understand changes in hydrophobic and
ionic interactions in nano droplets. Solvation of hydrophobic and charged
species change drastically in nano water droplets. Hydrophobic species are
localized at the boundary. The tendency of ions to be at the boundary where
water density is low increases as the charge density decreases. Interaction
between hydrophobic, polar, and charged residue are also profoundly altered in

formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms,
e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to
fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of
the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of
samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing
existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the
cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms
converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the
paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are
provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned
solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the
computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of
that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal)
counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between

window onto the growth rate of large scale structure and a method for testing
general relativity. We investigate through a comparison of N-body simulations
to various extensions of perturbation theory beyond the linear regime, the
robustness of cosmological parameter extraction, including the gravitational
growth index, \gamma. We find that the Kaiser formula and some perturbation
theory approaches bias the growth rate by 1-sigma or more relative to the
fiducial at scales as large as k > 0.07 h/Mpc. This bias propagates to
estimates of the gravitational growth index as well as \Omega_m and the
equation of state parameter and presents a significant challenge to modelling
redshift space distortions. We also determine an accurate fitting function for
a combination of line of sight damping and higher order angular dependence that
allows robust modelling of the redshift space power spectrum to substantially
higher k.

ideal-Higgs-like points not only pass LEP constraints but are also acceptable
in terms of the numerous constraints now available, including those from the
Tevatron and $B$-factory data, $(g-2)_\mu$ and the relic density $\Omega h^2$.
In general for this particular methodology and range of parameters chosen, very
few points corresponding to said previous studies were found, and those that
were found were at best $2\sigma$ away from the preferred relic density value.
Instead, there exist a class of points, which combine a mostly singlet-like
Higgs with a mostly singlino-like neutralino coannihilating with the lightest
stau, that are able to effectively pass all implemented constraints in the
region $80<m_h<100$. It seems that the spin-independent direct detection cross
section acts as a key discriminator between ideal Higgs points and the hard to
detect singlino-like points.

tiles are required to ""cooperate"" in order to be able to bind to a growing tile
assembly (a.k.a., temperature 2 self-assembly), then Turing universal
computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \times N$ squares is
achievable in the aTAM (Rotemund and Winfree, STOC 2000). So yes, in a
computational sense, the aTAM is quite powerful! However, if one completely
removes this cooperativity condition (a.k.a., temperature 1 self-assembly),
then the computational ""power"" of the aTAM (i.e., its ability to support Turing
universal computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \times N$ squares)
becomes unknown. On the plus side, the aTAM, at temperature 1, isn't only
Turing universal but also supports the efficient self-assembly $N \times N$
squares if self-assembly is allowed to utilize three spatial dimensions (Fu,
Schweller and Cook, SODA 2011). We investigate the theoretical ""power"" of a
seemingly simple, restrictive class of tile assembly systems (TASs) in which
(1) the absolute value of every glue strength is 1, (2) there's a single
negative strength glue type and (3) unequal glues can't interact. We call these
the \emph{restricted glue} TASs (rgTAS). We first show the tile complexity of
producing an $N \times N$ square with an rgTAS is $O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log
n})$. We also prove that rgTASs are Turing universal with a construction that
simulates an arbitrary Turing machine. Next, we provide results for a variation
of the rgTAS class, partially restricted glue TASs, which is similar except
that the magnitude of the negative glue's strength can only assumed to be $\ge
1$. These results consist of a construction with $O(\log n)$ tile complexity
for building $N \times N$ squares, and one which simulates a Turing machine but
with a greater scaling factor than for the rgTAS construction.

Gene-expression energies, obtained for thousands of mouse genes by numerization

generalized to sets of genes and the problem of optimal markers of a classical

are introduced here and are springs with a force proportional to the
displacement in a direction other than the direction of the spring terminals.
Possible homogenizations of the transformed networks are presented, with
potential applications to cloaking. In the second and third parts we present
cloaking methods that are based on cancelling an incident field using active
devices which are exterior to the cloaked region and that do not generate
significant fields far away from the devices. In the second part, the exterior
cloaking problem for the Laplace equation is reformulated as the problem of
polynomial approximation of analytic functions. An explicit solution is given
that allows to cloak larger objects at a fixed distance from the cloaking
device, compared to previous explicit solutions. In the third part we consider

Aharonov-Bohm interferometer containing a double quantum dot using the
nonequilibrium Green's function method. Under the condition that one of the
three terminals is a voltage probe, we show that the linear conductance is
symmetric with respect to the magnetic field (phase symmetry). However, in the
nonlinear transport regime, the phase symmetry is broken. Unlike two-terminal
transport, the phase symmetry is broken even in noninteracting electron
systems. Based on the lowest-order nonlinear conductance coefficient with
respect to the source-drain bias voltage, we discuss the direction in which the
phase shifts with the magnetic field. When the higher harmonic components of
the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are negligible, the phaseshift is a
monotonically increasing function with respect to the source-drain bias
voltage. To observe the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with higher visibility, we
need strong coupling between the quantum dots and the voltage probe. However,
this leads to dephasing since the voltage probe acts as a B\""{u}ttiker
dephasing probe. The interplay between such antithetic concepts provides a peak
in the visibility of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations when the coupling between
the quantum dots and the voltage probe changes.

Anderson to a quantum Hall insulator takes place when the Drude value of the
non-diagonal conductivity is equal to 1/2. The weaker is the magnetic field the
harder it is to locate a delocalization transition using quantum simulations.
The main idea of the present study is that the position of the transition does
not change when a strong local inhomogeneity is introduced. Since the strong
inhomogeneity suppresses interference, transport reduces to classical
percolation. We show that the corresponding percolation problem is bond
percolation over two sublattices coupled to each other by random bonds.
Simulation of this percolation allows to access the domain of very weak
magnetic fields. Simulation results confirm the criterion \sigma_{xy}=1/2 for
values \sigma_{xx}\sim 10, where they agree with earlier quantum simulation
results. However for larger \sigma_{xx} we find that the transition boundary is
described by \sigma_{xy} \sigma_{xx}^k with k= 0.5, i.e., the transition takes
place at higher magnetic fields. The strong inhomogeneity limit of
magnetotransport in the presence of a random magnetic field, pertinent to
composite fermions, corresponds to a different percolation problem. In this
limit we find for the delocalization transition boundary \sigma_{xy}
\sigma_{xx}^{0.6}.

Quantum repeater network development is currently at the stage where we risk
similar duplication when separate systems are combined. We propose a unifying

notion of a Quantum Recursive Network Architecture, developed from the emerging
classical concept of 'recursive networks', extending recursive mechanisms from
a focus on data forwarding to a more general distributed computing request
framework. Recursion abstracts independent transit networks as single relay
nodes, unifies software layering, and virtualizes the addresses of resources to
improve information hiding and resource management. Our architecture is useful
for building arbitrary distributed states, including fundamental distributed

block computation strategies for computing symmetric Boolean functions. We
study three classes of functions: threshold functions, delta functions and
interval functions. We provide exactly optimal strategies for the first two
classes, and a scaling law order-optimal strategy with optimal preconstant for
interval functions. We also extend the results to the case of integer
measurements and certain integer-valued functions. We use lower bounds from
communication complexity theory, and provide an achievable scheme using
information theoretic tools.
  Next, we consider the case where nodes measurements are random and drawn from
independent Bernoulli distributions. We address the problem of optimal function
computation so as to minimize the expected total number of bits that are
transmitted. In the case of computing a single instance of a Boolean threshold
function, we show the surprising result that the optimal order of transmissions
depends in an extremely simple way on the values of previously transmitted
bits, and the ordering of the marginal probabilities of the Boolean variables.
  The approach presented can be generalized to the case where each node has a
block of measurements, though the resulting problem is somewhat harder, and we
conjecture the optimal strategy. We further show how to generalize to a pulse
model of communication. One can also consider the related problem of
approximate computation given a fixed number of bits. In this case, the optimal
strategy is significantly different, and lacks an elegant characterization.
However, for the special case of the parity function, we show that the greedy
strategy is optimal.

factor, where epsilon is an arbitrary small positive constant. It needs
O(n^{3/4}log_{1+epsilon}^2(n) communication rounds with high probability (n

our algorithm currently has the best approximation factor for the facility
location problem in a distributed setting. It is based on a greedy sequential
approximation algorithm by Jain et al. (J. ACM 50(6), pages: 795-824, 2003).
The main difficulty in executing this sequential algorithm lies in dealing with
situations, where multiple facilities are eligible for opening, but (in order
to preserve the approximation factor of the sequential algorithm) only a subset
of them can actually be opened. Note that while the presented runtime bound of
our algorithm is ""with high probability"", the approximation factor is not ""in

contribution is a sublinear time selection mechanism that, while increasing the
approximation factor by an arbitrary small additive term, allows us to decide
which of the eligible facilities to open.

  The night sky brightness in the relevant wavelength regime for
photomultipliers was found to be at the same level as measured in similar
campaigns at the established Cherenkov telescope sites of Khomas, Namibia, and
at La Palma. The brightness of dark regions in the sky is about 2 x 10^12

bright regions of the sky towards the galactic plane. The brightness in V band
is 21.6 magnitudes per arcsec^2 in the dark regions. All brightness levels are
averaged over the field of view of the instrument of about 1.3 x 10^(-3) sr.

annihilation cross section. During the dark star phase, the star expands over a
thousand solar-radii, while the surface temperature remains below 10^4 K. The
energy generated by nuclear reactions is not dominant during this phase. We
also study models with different gas mass accretion rates and the DM particle
masses. All our models for different DM particle masses pass the dark star
phase. The final mass of the dark stars is essentially unchanged for DM mass of
m_DM <= 10 GeV. Gravitational collapse of the massive dark stars will leave
massive black holes with mass as large as 1000 M_sun in the early universe.

in the solar corona.
  Aims: There are two main competing views about the origin of coronal shocks:
that they originate in either blast waves ignited by the pressure pulse of a
flare or piston-driven shocks due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We studied
three well-observed type II bursts in an attempt to place tighter constraints
on their origins.
  Methods: The type II bursts were observed by the ARTEMIS radio spectrograph
and imaged by the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH) at least at two frequencies.
To take advantage of projection effects, we selected events that occurred away
from disk center.
  Results: In all events, both flares and CMEs were observed. In the first
event, the speed of the shock was about 4200 km/s, while the speed of the CME
was about 850 km/s. This discrepancy ruled out the CME as the primary shock
driver. The CME may have played a role in the ignition of another shock that
occurred just after the high speed one. A CME driver was excluded from the
second event as well because the CMEs that appeared in the coronagraph data
were not synchronized with the type II burst. In the third event, the
kinematics of the CME which was determined by combining EUV and white light
data was broadly consistent with the kinematics of the type II burst, and,
therefore, the shock was probably CME-driven.
  Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the diversity of conditions that may lead
to the generation of coronal shocks.

on a planet's thermal structure and the related heat flux across the core
mantle boundary. For terrestrial planets more massive than the Earth, our
calculations suggest that a substantial part of the lowermost mantle is in a
sluggish convective regime, primarily due to pressure effects on viscosity.
Hence, we find substantially higher core temperatures than previously reported
from parameterized convection models. We also discuss the effect of melting
point depression in the presence of impurities (e.g., sulfur) in iron-rich
cores and compare corresponding melting relations to the calculated thermal
structure. Since impurity effects become less important at the elevated

iron-rich cores are likely solid, implying that a self-sustained magnetic field

mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs (i.e., a permutation). We
propose and investigate a wireless switching framework in which a multi-antenna
relay is responsible for switching traffic among a set of $N$ stations. We
refer to such a relay as a MIMO switch. With beamforming and linear detection,
the MIMO switch controls which stations are connected to which other stations.
Each beamforming matrix realizes a permutation pattern among the stations. We
refer to the corresponding permutation matrix as a switch matrix. By scheduling
a set of different switch matrices, full connectivity among the stations can be
established. In this paper, we focus on ""fair switching"" in which equal amounts
of traffic are to be delivered for all $N(N-1)$ ordered pairs of stations. In
particular, we investigate how the system throughput can be maximized. In
general, for large $N$ the number of possible switch matrices (i.e.,
permutations) is huge, making the scheduling problem combinatorially
challenging. We show that for the cases of N=4 and 5, only a subset of $N-1$
switch matrices need to be considered in the scheduling problem to achieve good
throughput. We conjecture that this will be the case for large $N$ as well.
This conjecture, if valid, implies that for practical purposes, fair-switching
scheduling is not an intractable problem. We also investigate MIMO switching
with physical-layer network coding in this paper. We find that it can improve
throughput appreciably.

theoretically and verified experimentally scaling laws of magnetotunneling

self-consistent analysis of magnetotunneling data at different levels of bias,
dissipation powers and for different mesa sizes, which precludes the influence
of self-heating. It is found that $H_{c2}(0)$ for Bi(Pb)-2212 is $\simeq 70$ T

magnetoresistance is suppressed exponentially at $T>T_c/2$, but remains

showing repetitive brightenings due to increased accretion from the
circumstellar disk to the star. In this paper, we report on medium-resolution
near-infrared spectroscopy of EX\,Lup taken during its extreme outburst in
2008, as well as numerical modeling with the aim of determining the physical
conditions around the star. We detect emission lines from atomic hydrogen,
helium, and metals, as well as first overtone bandhead emission from carbon
monoxide. Our results indicate that the emission lines are originating from gas
located in a dust-free region within ~ 0.2 AU of the star. The profile of the
CO bandhead indicates that the CO gas has a temperature of 2500 K, and is
located in the inner edge of the disk or in the outer parts of funnel flows.
The atomic metals are probably co-located with the CO. Some metallic lines are
fluorescently excited, suggesting direct exposure to ultraviolet photons. The
Brackett series indicates emission from hot (10000 K) and optically thin gas.
The hydrogen lines display a strong spectro-astrometric signal, suggesting that
the hydrogen emission is probably not coming from an equatorial boundary layer;
a funnel flow or disk wind origin is more likely. This picture is broadly
consistent with the standard magnetospheric accretion model usually assumed for
normally accreting T Tauri stars. Our results also set constraints on the
eruption mechanism, supporting a model where material piles up around the
corotation radius and episodically falls onto the star.

reduce the formation energies of these defects. In the presence of both V

models, phase diagrams are constructed by averaging over the ensemble of
theories that possesses the relevant symmetries of the problem. Although
approximate in nature, this approach has a number of advantages. First, it can
be useful in distinguishing generic features from model-dependent details.
Second, it can help in understanding the `minimal' number of symmetry
constraints required to reproduce specific phase structures. Third, the
robustness of predictions can be checked with respect to variations in the
detailed description of the interactions. Finally, near critical points, random
matrix models bear strong similarities to Ginsburg-Landau theories with the
advantage of additional constraints inherited from the symmetries of the
underlying interaction. These constraints can be helpful in ruling out certain
topologies in the phase diagram. In this Key Issue, we illustrate the basic
structure of random matrix models, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and

coronal hole spicules reach coronal temperatures. We combine multi-instrument
co-observations obtained with the SUMER/SoHO and with the EIS/SOT/XRT/Hinode.
The analysed three large spicules were found to be comprised of numerous thin
spicules which rise, rotate and descend simultaneously forming a bush-like
feature. Their rotation resembles the untwisting of a large flux rope. They
show velocities ranging from 50 to 250 km/s. We clearly associated the red- and
blue-shifted emissions in transition region lines with rotating but also with
rising and descending plasmas, respectively. Our main result is that these
spicules although very large and dynamic, show no presence in spectral lines
formed at temperatures above 300 000 K. The present paper brings out the
analysis of three Ca II H large spicules which are composed of numerous dynamic
thin spicules but appear as macrospicules in EUV lower resolution images. We
found no coronal counterpart of these and smaller spicules. We believe that the
identification of phenomena which have very different origins as macrospicules
is due to the interpretation of the transition region emission, and especially
the He II emission, wherein both chromospheric large spicules and coronal X-ray
jets are present. We suggest that the recent observation of spicules in the
coronal AIA/SDO 171 A and 211 A channels is probably due to the existence of
transition region emission there.

that the inner layers of the supernova ejecta ($v \lsim 8000$\,\kms) contain
less mass than predicted by classical explosion models like W7. If this inner
region contains $\sim 0.5 \Msun$ of material, as opposed to $\sim 0.9 \Msun$ in
Chandrasekhar-mass models developed within the Single Degenerate scenario, the
low density inhibits recombination, favouring the large \FeIII/\FeII\ ratio
observed in the optical, and decreases the flux in the \FeII\ lines which
dominate the IR spectrum. The most likely scenario may be an explosion of a
sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. Alternatively, the violent/dynamical merger
of two white dwarfs with combined mass exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit also
shows a reduced inner density.

achieve better alignment. In order to overcome problems associated with false
peaks in the cross correlations function, we use artificially blurred images
for the early stage of the iterative cross correlation method and segment the
intermediate class average from every iteration step. These two additional
manipulations combined with the reduced search space size in the cross

affecting the stellar matter. In particular, the low-energy excitations, whose
energy is proportional to the transfered momentum, can play a major role in the
emission and propagation of neutrinos. In this paper, we focus on the density
modes associated with the proton component in the homogeneous matter of the
outer core of neutron stars (at density between one and three times the nuclear
saturation density, where the baryonic constituants are expected to be neutrons
and protons). In this region, it is predicted that the protons are
superconductor. We study the respective roles of the proton pairing and Coulomb
interaction in determining the properties of the modes associated with the
proton component. This study is performed in the framework of the Random Phase
Approximation, generalized in order to describe the response of a superfluid
system.The formalism we use ensures that the Generalized Ward's Identities are
satisfied. An important conclusion of this work is the presence of a
pseudo-Goldstone mode associated with the proton superconductor in neutron-star
matter. Indeed, the Goldstone mode, which characterizes a pure superfluid, is
suppressed in usual superconductors due to the long-range Coulomb interaction,
which only allows a plasmon mode. However, for the proton component of stellar
matter, the Coulomb field is screened by the electrons and a pseudo-Goldstone
mode occurs, with a velocity increased by the Coulomb interaction.

progenitors remains disputed. Short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)
are less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, and
exhibit significantly fainter afterglows. Aims: It is of critical importance to
establish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different GRB
population models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. The Swift GRB
090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. Its duration
(T_90=1.28 s) places GRB 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while the
high redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectral
characteristics are more similar to those of long-duration GRBs. Methods: On
the basis of data obtained with the Tautenburg 2m telescope (Germany) and the
7-channel imager GROND (La Silla, Chile), we compiled the most finely sampled
light curve available for a short burst optical/NIR afterglow. The light curve
was then analysed in a standard fashion. GROND and XRT data were used to
determine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow across
more than three orders of magnitude. Results: Our data show that a light curve
break exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. This light curve
decay is achromatic in the optical/NIR bands, and interpreted as a post-jet
break phase. The X-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.
Conclusions: The half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as the
luminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that GRB 090426
is probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger of
two compact objects.

Focusing on commensurate fillings away from half filling, we find a strong
asymmetry between attractive and repulsive interactions. Attraction is found to
always lead to pairing, associated with a spin gap, and to pair crystallization
for very strong mass imbalance. In the repulsive case the two atomic components
remain instead fully gapless over a large parameter range; only a very strong
mass imbalance leads to the opening of a spin gap. The spin-gap phase is the
precursor of a crystalline phase occurring for an even stronger mass imbalance.
The fundamental asymmetry of the phase diagram is at odds with recent
theoretical predictions, and can be tested directly via time-of-flight

tool for evaluating the worst-case efficiency of asynchronous systems. The tool
is based on some well-established results in the setting of a timed process
algebra (PAFAS: a Process Algebra for Faster Asynchronous Systems). To show the
applicability of FASE to concrete meaningful examples, we consider three
implementations of a bounded buffer and use FASE to automatically evaluate
their worst-case efficiency. We finally contrast our results with previous ones
where the efficiency of the same implementations has already been considered.

  holes","40 pages, 15 figures","Class.Quant.Grav.29:055003,2012","10.1088/0264-9381/29/5/055003",,"gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the dynamical formation and evolution of 2 +
1-dimensional charged black holes. We numerically study dynamical collapses of
charged matter fields in an anti de Sitter background and note the formation of
black holes using the double-null formalism. Moreover, we include re-normalized
energy-momentum tensors assuming the S-wave approximation to determine
thermodynamical back-reactions to the internal structures. If there is no
semi-classical effects, the amount of charge determines the causal structures.
If the charge is sufficiently small, the causal structure has a space-like
singularity. However, as the charge increases, an inner Cauchy horizon appears.
If we have sufficient charge, we see a space-like outer horizon and a time-like
inner horizon, and if we give excessive charge, black hole horizons disappear.
We have some circumstantial evidences that weak cosmic censorship is still
satisfied, even for such excessive charge cases. Also, we confirm that there is
mass inflation along the inner horizon, although the properties are quite
different from those of four-dimensional cases. Semi-classical back-reactions
will not affect the outer horizon, but they will affect the inner horizon. Near
the center, there is a place where negative energy is concentrated. Thus,
charged black holes in three dimensions have two types of curvature
singularities in general: via mass inflation and via a concentration of
negative energy. Finally, we classify possible causal structures.
