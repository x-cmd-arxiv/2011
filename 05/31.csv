  is an expanded version of a paper that was presented in IEEE INFOCOM 2008",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of quickest event detection with sleep-wake
scheduling in small extent wireless sensor networks in which, at each time
slot, each sensor node in the awake state observes a sample and communicates
the information to the fusion centre. The sensor nodes in the sleep state do
not sample or communicate any information to the fusion centre (FC), thereby
conserving energy. At each time slot, the FC, after having received the samples
from the sensor nodes in the wake state, makes a decision to stop (and thus
declare that the event has occurred) or to continue observing. If it decides to
continue, the FC also makes the decision of choosing the number of sensor nodes
to be in the wake state in the next time slot. We consider three alternative
approaches to the problem of choosing the number of sensor nodes to be in the
wake state in time slot k+1, based on the information available at time slot k,
namely, 1. optimal control of M_{k+1}, the number of sensor nodes to be in the
awake state in time slot k+1, 2. optimal control of q_{k+1}, the probability of
a sensor node to be in the awake state in time slot k+1, and 3. optimal
probability q that a sensor node is in the awake state in any time slot. In
each case, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process. We show
that a sufficient statistic for the decision at time k is the a posteriori
probability of change Pi_k. Also, we show that the optimal stopping rule is a
threshold rule on Pi_k. The optimal policy for M_{k+1} can keep very few
sensors wake during the prechange phase and then quickly increase the number of
sensors in the wake state when a change is ""suspected"". Among the three
sleep-wake algorithms described, we observe that the total cost is minimum for
the optimum control of M_{k+1} and is maximum for the optimum control on q.

With $M_i$ and $N_i$ denoting the number of antennas at transmitter $i$ and

were recently characterized by Huang et al., Zhu and Guo, and by the authors of
this paper for all values of numbers of antennas except when $\min(M_1,N_1) >

stars is applied to resolved stellar populations under the common assumption
that they mainly consist of single-age old stellar populations. We explore the
effect of the presence of mixed-age stellar populations on deriving photometric
metallicities. Methods. We use photometric data sets for the five Galactic
dwarf spheroidals Sculptor, Sextans, Carina, Fornax, and Leo II in order to
derive their photometric metallicity distribution functions from their resolved
red giant branches using isochrones of the Dartmouth Stellar Evolutionary
Database. We compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic
metallicities based on the analysis of the near-infrared Ca triplet (Ca T),
both on the metallicity scale of Carretta & Gratton and on the scale defined by
the Dartmouth isochrones. In addition, we compare the photometric metallicities
with published spectroscopic metallicities based on spectral synthesis and
medium-resolution spectroscopy, and on high resolution spectra where available.
Results. The mean properties of the spectroscopic and photometric metallicity
samples are comparable within the intrinsic scatter of each method although the
mean metallicities of dSphs with pronounced intermediate-age population
fractions may be underestimated by the photometric method by up to a few tenths
of dex in [Fe/H]. The star-by-star differences of the spectroscopic minus the
photometric metallicities show a wide range of values along the fiducial
spectroscopic metallicity range, with the tendency to have systematically lower
photometric metallicities for those dwarf spheroidals with a higher fraction of
intermediate-age populations. Such discrepancies persist even in the case of
the purely old Sculptor dSph, where one would na\""ively expect a very good
match when comparing with medium or low resolution metallicity measurements.
Overall, the agreement between Ca T metallicities and photometric metallicities
is very good in the metallicity range from ~ -2 dex to ~ -1.5 dex. We find that
the photometric method is reliable in galaxies that contain small (less than
15%) intermediate-age stellar fractions. Therefore, in the presence of
mixed-age stellar populations, one needs to quantify the fraction of the
intermediate-age stars in order to assess their effect on determining
metallicities from photometry alone. Finally, we note that the comparison of
spectroscopic metallicities of the same stars obtained with different methods
reveals similarly large discrepancies as the comparison with photometric
metallicities.

above it mainly evolve via mergers. Including gas dissipation in major mergers,
efficiently shrinks galaxies, especially those with final mass Ms < 10^11 Msun
that are the most gas-rich, improving the match with different observables. We
find that the predicted scatter in sizes at fixed stellar mass is still larger
than the observed one by up to <40%. Spheroids are, on average, more compact at
higher redshifts at fixed stellar mass, and at fixed redshift and stellar mass
larger galaxies tend to be more starforming. More specifically, while for
bulge-dominated galaxies the model envisages a nearly mass-independent decrease
in sizes, the predicted size evolution for intermediate-mass galaxies is more
complex. The z=2 progenitors of massive galaxies with mass around Ms and
B/T>0.7 at z=0, are found to be mostly disc-dominated galaxies with a median
B/T ~ 0.3, with only ~20% remaining bulge-dominated. The model also predicts
that central spheroids living in more massive haloes tend to have larger sizes
at fixed stellar mass. Including host halo mass dependence in computing
velocity dispersions, allows the model to properly reproduce the correlations
with stellar mass. We also discuss the fundamental plane, the correlations with
galaxy age, the structural properties of pseudobulges, and the correlations

function, which can be evaluated, contains a term which accounts for the cost
of assigning a fraction of the total degree to an ""infinite"" degree component,
that is, when an atypical ""condensation"" effect occurs with respect to the

of a coupled system of ODEs from which power law bounds for the limiting degree

that the process can deviate to a variety of atypical nonpower law
distributions with finite cost, including distributions typically associated

$j_0$ comparable with the intrachain exchange. Indeed, the transition amplitude
characterizing the transfer quality exhibits a maximum for a finite optimal
value $j_0^{opt}(N)$, where $N$ is the channel length. We show that
$j_0^{opt}(N)$ scales as $N^{-1/6}$ for large $N$ and that it ensures a
high-quality entanglement transfer even in the limit of arbitrarily long
channels, almost independently of the channel initialization. For instance, the
average quantum-state transmission fidelity exceeds 90% for any chain length.

adjusting the channel length to its optimal value.

in which the effect of the event at a sensor node depends on the distance
between the event and the sensor node; in particular, in the Boolean sensing
model, all sensors in a disk of a given radius around the event are equally
affected. Following the prior work reported in
\cite{nikiforov95change_isolation},
\cite{nikiforov03lower-bound-for-det-isolation},

weak Lefschetz property in many new cases.
  For numerous classes of punctured hexagonal regions we find closed formulae
for the enumerations of signed lozenge tilings, and thus the field
characteristics in which the associated algebras fail to the have the weak
Lefschetz property. Further, we offer a conjecture for a closed formula for the
enumerations of signed lozenge tilings of symmetric punctured hexagonal

by Migliore, Mir\'o-Roig, and the second author that classifies the {\em level}
artinian monomial almost complete intersections in three variables that have
the weak Lefschetz property in characteristic zero. Moreover, the formulae are
used to generate families of algebras which never, or always, have the weak

take samples periodically and then contend over a {\em random access network}

procedures at the fusion center to process the measurements. The Bayesian
setting is assumed; i.e., the fusion center has a prior distribution on the
change time. In the first procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion
center is \emph{network-oblivious} and makes a decision only when a complete
vector of measurements taken at a sampling instant is available. In the second
procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is \emph{network-aware}
and processes measurements as they arrive, but in a time causal order. In this
case, the decision statistic depends on the network delays as well, whereas in
the network-oblivious case, the decision statistic does not depend on the
network delays. This yields a Bayesian change detection problem with a tradeoff
between the random network delay and the decision delay; a higher sampling rate
reduces the decision delay but increases the random access delay. Under
periodic sampling, in the network--oblivious case, the structure of the optimal
stopping rule is the same as that without the network, and the optimal change
detection delay decouples into the network delay and the optimal decision delay
without the network. In the network--aware case, the optimal stopping problem
is analysed as a partially observable Markov decision process, in which the
states of the queues and delays in the network need to be maintained. A
sufficient statistic for decision is found to be the network-state and the
posterior probability of change having occurred given the measurements received

more suitable for explaining the known data on occupation of some caves in

are related to that structure and which leave certain aspects of the structure
invariant. Examples are the automorphism group, the self-embedding monoid, the
endomorphism monoid, or the polymorphism clone of a structure. Such functions
can be particularly well understood when the relational structure is countably
infinite and has a first-order definition in another relational structure which
has a finite language, is totally ordered and homogeneous, and has the Ramsey
property. This is because in this situation, Ramsey theory provides the
combinatorial tool for analyzing these functions -- in a certain sense, it
allows to represent such functions by functions on finite sets.
  This is a survey of results in model theory and theoretical computer science
obtained recently by the authors in this context. In model theory, we approach
the problem of classifying the reducts of countably infinite ordered
homogeneous Ramsey structures in a finite language, and certain decidability
questions connected with such reducts. In theoretical computer science, we use
the same combinatorial methods in order to classify the computational
complexity for various classes of infinite-domain constraint satisfaction
problems. While the first set of applications is obviously of an infinitary

""the MacDonald torque"" is often combined with an assumption that the quality
factor Q is frequency-independent. This makes the method inconsistent, because
the MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the
inverse tidal frequency.
  Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called ""the Darwin
torque"". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary
frequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the
literature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal
frequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a
corrected version of the MacDonald torque.
  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties
of realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is
more complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit
interaction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme
for the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances. We derive the
frequency-dependence of the tidal torque from the first principles, i.e., from
the expression for the mantle's compliance in the time domain. We also explain
that the tidal torque includes not only the secular part, but also an
oscillating part.
  We demonstrate that the lmpq term of the Darwin-Kaula expansion for the tidal
torque smoothly goes through zero, when the secondary traverses the lmpq
resonance (e.g., the principal tidal torque smoothly goes through nil as the
secondary crosses the synchronous orbit).
  We also offer a possible explanation for the unexpected frequency-dependence
of the tidal dissipation rate in the Moon, discovered by LLR.

The cavities are internally confined by external pressure, with zero gradient

$\Gamma>4/3$, the expansion ultimately leads to the formation of large-scale

partially offset the adiabatic and radiative losses of radio emitting
electrons. We demonstrate that if the formation of large-scale current sheets

segregation is inherent in the cluster. The present-day luminosity and mass

of planet formation, is a complex dynamical problem that involves many orders
of magnitudes. To serve this purpose, we present a new hybrid algorithm that
combines a Fokker-Planck approach with the advantages of a pure
direct-summation N-body scheme, with a very accurate integration of close
encounters for the orbital evolution of the larger bodies with a statistical
model, envisaged to simulate the very large number of smaller planetesimals in
the disc. Direct-summation techniques have been historically developped for the
study of dense stellar systems such as open and globular clusters and, within
some limits imposed by the number of stars, of galactic nuclei. The number of
modifications to adapt direct-summation N-body techniques to planetary dynamics
is not undemanding and requires modifications. These include the way close
encounters are treated, as well as the selection process for the ""neighbour
radius"" of the particles and the extended Hermite scheme, used for the very
first time in this work, as well as the implementation of a central potential,
drag forces and the adjustment of the regularisation treatment. For the
statistical description of the planetesimal disc we employ a Fokker-Planck
approach. We include dynamical friction, high- and low-speed encounters, the
role of distant encounters as well as gas and collisional damping and then
generalise the model to inhomogenous discs. We then describe the combination of
the two techniques to address the whole problem of planetesimal dynamics in a
realistic way via a transition mass to integrate the evolution of the particles
according to their masses.

by the tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by a neutron star (NS) or stellar
mass black hole (BH). At radii r <~ 1e8.5-1e9 cm the midplane density and
temperature are sufficiently high to burn the initial white dwarf material into
increasingly heavier elements (e.g. Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni) at sequentially
smaller radii. When the energy released by nuclear reactions is comparable to
that released gravitationally, we term the disk a nuclear-dominated accretion
flow (NuDAF). At small radii <~1e7 cm Fe photo-disintegrates into He and then
free nuclei, and cooling by neutrinos may be efficient. At the high accretion
rates of relevance ~ 0.1-1e-4 Msun/s, most of the disk is radiatively
inefficient and prone to outflows powered by viscous dissipation and nuclear
burning. Outflow properties are calculated by requiring that material in the
midplane be marginally bound (Bernoulli constant <~ 0), due (in part) to
cooling by matter escaping the disk. For reasonable assumptions regarding the
properties of disk winds, we show that a significant fraction >50-80 per cent
of the total WD mass is unbound. The ejecta composition is predominantly O, C,
Si, Mg, Ne, Fe, and S [He, C, Si, S, Ar, and Fe], in the case of C-O [He] WDs,
respectively, along with a small quantity ~1e-3-1e-2 Msun of radioactive Ni56

the radioactive decay of Ni56 and radio transients powered by the interaction
of the ejecta with the interstellar medium. We address whether recently

Focusing on the presence of an accretion flow, and accounting for the amount of

we are able to follow the growth, evolution, and dispersal of individual giant
molecular clouds. Our model clouds reproduce the scaling relations observed in
both galactic and extragalactic clouds. We find that accretion and star
formation contribute contribute roughly equal amounts of turbulent kinetic
energy over the lifetime of the cloud. Clouds attain virial equilibrium and
grow in such a way as to maintain roughly constant surface densities, with
typical surface densities of order 50 - 200 Msun pc^-2, in good agreement with
observations of giant molecular clouds in the Milky Way and nearby external
galaxies. We find that as clouds grow, their velocity dispersion and radius
must also increase, implying that the linewidth-size relation constitutes an
age sequence. Lastly, we compare our models to observations of giant molecular
clouds and associated young star clusters in the LMC and find good agreement
between our model clouds and the observed relationship between H ii regions,
young star clusters, and giant molecular clouds.

than in brighter systems, a trend that could be explained by a truncated and/or
steeper IMF in small galaxies. However, at low star formation rates (SFRs), the
Halpha to FUV ratio can vary due to stochastic sampling even for a universal
IMF, a hypothesis that has, prior to this work, received limited investigation.
Using SLUG, a fully stochastic code for synthetic photometry in star clusters
and galaxies, we compare the Halpha and FUV luminosity in a sample of ~450
nearby galaxies with models drawn from a universal Kroupa IMF and a modified
IMF, the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF). Once random
sampling and time evolution are included, a Kroupa IMF convolved with the
cluster mass function reproduces the observed Halpha distribution at all FUV
luminosities, while a truncated IMF as implemented in current IGIMF models
underpredicts the Halpha luminosity by more than an order of magnitude at the
lowest SFRs. We conclude that the observed luminosity is the result of the
joint probability distribution function of the SFR, cluster mass function, and
a universal IMF, consistent with parts of the IGIMF theory, but that a
truncation in the IMF in clusters is inconsistent with the observations. Future
work will examine stochastic star formation and its time dependence in detail
to study whether random sampling can explain other observations that suggest a
varying IMF.

to the surrounding distribution of matter. In order to understand the motion of
the Local Group with respect to the Cosmic Microwave Background, a deep all-sky
map of the galaxy distribution is required. Here we present a new redshift
compilation of 69~160 galaxies, dubbed 2M++, to map large-scale structures of
the Local Universe over nearly the whole sky, and reaching depths of K <= 12.5,
or 200 Mpc/h. The target catalogue is based on the Two-Micron-All-Sky Extended
Source Catalog (2MASS-XSC). The primary sources of redshifts are the 2MASS
Redshift Survey, the 6dF galaxy redshift survey and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (DR7). We assess redshift completeness in each region and compute the
weights required to correct for redshift incompleteness and apparent magnitude
limits, and discuss corrections for incompleteness in the Zone of Avoidance. We
present the density field for this survey, and discuss the importance of
large-scale structures such as the Shapley Concentration.

reduction in which the internal space is a sphere. Examples include type IIB
supergravity reduced on S^5, and eleven-dimensional supergravity reduced on S^4
or S^7. Consistency means that any solution of the dimensionally-reduced theory
lifts to give a solution in the higher dimension. Although supersymmetry seems
to play a role in the consistency of these reductions, it cannot be the whole
story since consistent sphere reductions of non-supersymmetric theories are
also known, such as the reduction of the effective action of the bosonic string
in any dimension D on either a 3-sphere or a (D-3)-sphere, retaining the gauge
bosons of SO(4) or SO(D-2) respectively. We show that although there is no
supersymmetry, there is nevertheless a natural Killing spinor equation for the
D-dimensional bosonic string. A projection of the full integrability condition
for these Killing spinors gives rise to the bosonic equations of motion (just
as happens in the supergravity examples). Thus it appears that by extending the
notion of supersymmetry to ""pseudo-supersymmetry"" in this way, one may be able
to obtain a broader understanding of a relation between Killing spinors and
consistent sphere reductions.

discrete memoryless channel whose input and output are matrices (over a finite
field) related by a multiplicative transfer matrix. The model considered here
assumes that all transfer matrices with the same rank are equiprobable, so that
the channel is completely characterized by the rank distribution of the
transfer matrix. This model is seen to be more flexible than previously
proposed ones in describing random linear network coding systems subject to
link erasures, while still being sufficiently simple to allow tractability. The
model is also conservative in the sense that its capacity provides a lower
bound on the capacity of any channel with the same rank distribution. A main
contribution is to express the channel capacity as the solution of a convex
optimization problem which can be easily solved by numerical computation. For
the special case of constant-rank input, a closed-form expression for the
capacity is obtained. The behavior of the channel for asymptotically large
field size or packet length is studied, and it is shown that constant-rank
input suffices in this case. Finally, it is proved that the well-known approach
of treating inputs and outputs as subspaces is information-lossless even in
this more general model.

we consider the means to convert a relational model into a hypergraph model in
two layers. At the bottom layer, each relational tuple can be considered as a
star graph centered where the primary key node is surrounded by non-primary key

disposal of a network searching for spectral opportunities. In this work, we
employ the idea of sequential detection to obtain a quick, yet reliable,
decision regarding primary activity. Local detectors take measurements, and
only a few of them transmit the log likelihood ratios (LLR) to a fusion center
in descending order of LLR magnitude. The fusion center runs a sequential test
with a maximum imposed on the number of sensors that can report their LLR
measurements. We calculate the detection thresholds using two methods. The
first achieves the same probability of error as the optimal block detector. In
the second, an objective function is constructed and decision thresholds are
obtained via backward induction to optimize this function. The objective
function is related directly to the primary and secondary throughputs with
inbuilt privilege for primary operation. Simulation results demonstrate the
enhanced performance of the approaches proposed in this paper. We also
investigate the case of fading channels between the local sensors and the

univocally associated to a label. Reasoning algorithms manage labeled
constraints, associated label lists, and sets of mutually inconsistent
disjuncts. These algorithms guarantee consistency and obtain a minimal network.
Additionally, constraints can be organized in a hierarchy of alternative
temporal contexts. Therefore, we can reason on context-dependent disjunctive

(RRd) stars. About 400 RR Lyr stars are members of the Sagittarius Dwarf
Spheroidal Galaxy. The catalog includes the time-series photometry collected in
the course of the OGLE survey, basic parameters of the stars, finding charts,
and cross-identifications with other catalogs of RR Lyr stars toward the Milky
Way center.
  We notice that some RRd stars in the Galactic bulge show unusually short
periods and small ratio of periods, down to P_F=0.35 days and P_1O/P_F=0.726.
In the Petersen diagram double-mode RR Lyr stars form a parabola-like
structure, which connects shorter- and longer-period RRd stars. We show that
the unique properties of the bulge RRd stars may be explained by allowing for
the wide range of the metal abundance extending up to [Fe/H]=-0.36.
  We report the discovery of an RR Lyr star with additional eclipsing
variability with the orbital period of 15.2447 days. Some statistical features
of the RR Lyr sample are presented. We discuss potential applications of our
catalog in studying the structure and history of the central region of the
Galaxy, mapping the interstellar extinction toward the bulge, studying globular
clusters and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.

relativity to account for the intrinsic spin of matter. Spacetime torsion,
generated by spin of Dirac fields, induces gravitational repulsion in fermionic
matter at extremely high densities and prevents the formation of singularities.
Accordingly, the big bang is replaced by a bounce that occurred when the energy
density $\epsilon\propto gT^4$ was on the order of $n^2/m_\textrm{Pl}^2$ (in
natural units), where $n\propto gT^3$ is the fermion number density and $g$ is
the number of thermal degrees of freedom. If the early Universe contained only
the known standard-model particles ($g\approx 100$), then the energy density at
the big bounce was about 15 times larger than the Planck energy. The minimum
scale factor of the Universe (at the bounce) was about $10^{32}$ times smaller
than its present value, giving $\approx 50 \mum$. If more fermions existed in
the early Universe, then the spin-torsion coupling causes a bounce at a lower
energy and larger scale factor. Recent observations of high-energy photons from
gamma-ray bursts indicate that spacetime may behave classically even at scales
below the Planck length, supporting the classical spin-torsion mechanism of the
big bounce. Such a classical bounce prevents the matter in the contracting
Universe from reaching the conditions at which a quantum bounce could possibly
occur.

acting on the impurity leads to the Bloch oscillations of the impurity around a

threading an ADAF, and find that the magnetic field can be dragged inward by
the accretion flow efficiently, if the magnetic Prandtl number P~1. This is due
to the large radial velocity of the ADAF. It is found that the magnetic
pressure can be as high as ~50% of the gas pressure in the inner region of the
ADAF close to the black hole horizon, even if the external imposed vertical
field strength is <5% of the gas pressure at the outer radius of the ADAF,
which is caused by the gas plunging rapidly to the black hole within the
marginal stable circular orbit. In the inner region of the ADAF, the flow is
significantly pressured in the vertical direction by the magnetic field, and
therefore its gas pressure can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in
the ADAF without magnetic fields. This means that the magnetic field strength
near the black hole is underestimated by assuming equipartition between
magnetic and gas pressure with the conventional ADAF model. Our results show
that the magnetic field strength of the flow near the black hole horizon can be
more than one order of magnitude higher than that in the ADAF at 6GM/c^2, which
implies the Blandford-Znajek mechanism could be more important than the
Blandford-Payne mechanism for ADAFs. We find that the accretion flow is
decelerated near the black hole by the magnetic field when the external imposed
field is strong enough or the gas pressure of the flow is low at the outer
radius, or both. This corresponds to a critical accretion rate, below which the
accretion flow will be arrested by the magnetic field near the black hole for a
given external imposed field. In this case, the gas may accrete as magnetically
confined blobs diffusing through field lines in the region very close to the
black hole horizon, which is similar to those in compact stars.

provides a strictly larger region for all L>2. The principle of the CMS coding
scheme is to include a common message in every subset of the descriptions,
unlike the VKG scheme which sends a single common message in all the
descriptions. In essence, we show that allowing for a common codeword in every
subset of descriptions provides better freedom in coordinating the messages

Networks (MANET) is studied. The problem is to disseminate a piece of
information, initially held by a distinguished source node, to all nodes in a
set defined by some predicate. We use a model of MANETs that is well suited for
dynamic networks and opportunistic communication. In this model nodes are
placed in a plane, in which they can move with bounded speed, and communication
between nodes occurs over a collision-prone single channel. In this setup
informed and uninformed nodes can be disconnected for some time (bounded by a
parameter alpha), but eventually some uninformed node must become neighbor of
an informed node and remain so for some time (bounded by a parameter beta). In
addition, nodes can start at different times, and they can crash and recover.
Under the above framework, we show negative and positive results for different
types of randomized protocols, and we put those results in perspective with
respect to previous deterministic results.

impact of covariates on outcomes. The impact is described by the conditional
quantile function and its functionals. In this paper we develop the
nonparametric QR-series framework, covering many regressors as a special case,
for performing inference on the entire conditional quantile function and its
linear functionals. In this framework, we approximate the entire conditional
quantile function by a linear combination of series terms with
quantile-specific coefficients and estimate the function-valued coefficients
from the data. We develop large sample theory for the QR-series coefficient
process, namely we obtain uniform strong approximations to the QR-series
coefficient process by conditionally pivotal and Gaussian processes. Based on
these strong approximations, or couplings, we develop four resampling methods
(pivotal, gradient bootstrap, Gaussian, and weighted bootstrap) that can be
used for inference on the entire QR-series coefficient function.
  We apply these results to obtain estimation and inference methods for linear
functionals of the conditional quantile function, such as the conditional
quantile function itself, its partial derivatives, average partial derivatives,
and conditional average partial derivatives. Specifically, we obtain uniform
rates of convergence and show how to use the four resampling methods mentioned
above for inference on the functionals. All of the above results are for
function-valued parameters, holding uniformly in both the quantile index and
the covariate value, and covering the pointwise case as a by-product. We
demonstrate the practical utility of these results with an example, where we
estimate the price elasticity function and test the Slutsky condition of the
individual demand for gasoline, as indexed by the individual unobserved
propensity for gasoline consumption.

between itinerant and localized regimes of electrons in solids. The zero-order
approximation of this theory corresponds to extended dynamical mean-field
theory (EDMFT), a regular way to calculate nonlocal corrections to EDMFT is
provided. It is shown that dual ladder summation gives a conserving
approximation beyond EDMFT. The method is especially suitable for consideration
of collective magnetic and charge excitations and allows to calculate their

Our upperbound was based on a monotonicity property of a rate-region (called
the assisted residual information region) associated with the assisted common
information formulation. In this note we present further results. We explore
the connection of assisted common information with the Gray-Wyner system. We
show that the assisted residual information region and the Gray-Wyner region
are connected by a simple relationship: the assisted residual information
region is the increasing hull of the Gray-Wyner region under an affine map.
Several known relationships between GK common information and Gray-Wyner system
fall out as consequences of this. Quantities which arise in other source coding
contexts acquire new interpretations. In previous work we showed that assisted
common information can be used to derive upperbounds on the rate at which a
pair of parties can {\em securely sample} correlated random variables, given
correlated random variables from another distribution. Here we present an
example where the bound derived using assisted common information is much
better than previously known bounds, and in fact is tight. This example
considers correlated random variables defined in terms of standard variants of
oblivious transfer, and is interesting on its own as it answers a natural
question about these cryptographic primitives.

nuclei, knowledge of not only first-order but also second-order nonadiabatic
couplings (NAC), is required. Here we propose a method to efficiently calculate
second-order NAC from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), on the
basis of the Casida ansatz adapted for the computation of first-order NAC,
which has been justified in our previous work and can be shown to be valid for
calculating second-order NAC between ground state and singly excited states
within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation. Test calculations of second-order NAC in
the immediate vicinity of Jahn-Teller and Renner-Teller intersections show that
calculation results from TDDFT, combined with modified linear response theory,
agree well with the prediction from the Jahn-Teller / Renner-Teller models.
Contrary to the diverging behavior of first-order NAC near all types of
intersection points, the Cartesian components of second-order NAC are shown to
be negligibly small near Renner-Teller glancing intersections, while they are
significantly large near the Jahn-Teller conical intersections. Nevertheless,
the components of second-order NAC can cancel each other to a large extent in
Jahn-Teller systems, indicating the background of neglecting second-order NAC
in practical dynamics simulations. On the other hand, it is shown that such a
cancellation becomes less effective in an elliptic Jahn-Teller system and thus
the role of second-order NAC needs to be evaluated in the rigorous framework.
Our study shows that TDDFT is promising to provide accurate data of NAC for
full quantum mechanical simulation of nonadiabatic processes.

magnetic fields $H = 0.05$, 0.10 and 0.5 T in the temperature range 4-20 K.
These have enabled us to deduce that the anomalous temperature behaviour of the
coherent magnetic scattering from the Cu sublattice, which shows sharp
intensity minima at \Tcn1 $\approx 18$K and \Tcn2 $\approx 8$ K, is due to
cross-overs in the sign of the interaction between strongly coupled, weakly
ferromagnetic, CuO$_2$ layers. At \Tcn1\ the coupling changes from
ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic and long-range order between layers is
temporarily lost. \Tcn2\ is the temperature at which the Gd moments order and a
further reorganisation of the interlayer order takes place. The weak
ferromagnetism of the CuO layers is found to be due to a small rotation of the
Cu moments in the same direction as that in which their coordinating oxygen
squares rotate in the tetragonal to orthorhombic distortion of the crystal
structure. Further analysis of the flipping ratio measurements has enabled us
to model the magnetic structures of the zero-field and the field-induced phases

the derived expressions which does not require channel state information at the

each distributed antenna (DA) port, we consider the optimization of pairings of

ergodic sum rate among mode candidates. In our proposed scheme, the number of
mode candidates are greatly reduced compared to that of ideal mode selection.
In addition, we analyze the signal to noise ratio cross-over point for
different modes using the sum rate expressions. Through Monte Carlo
simulations, we show the accuracy of our derivations for the ergodic sum rate.
Moreover, simulation results with the pathloss modeling confirm that the
proposed scheme produces the average sum rate identical to the ideal mode

independent ratio between two angular diameter distances $D_{ds}/D_s$ from
various large systematic gravitational lens surveys and lensing by galaxy
clusters combined with X-ray observations, and check the possibility to use it
in the future as complementary to other cosmological probes. On one hand,
strongly gravitationally lensed quasar-galaxy systems create such a new
opportunity by combining stellar kinematics (central velocity dispersion
measurements) with lensing geometry (Einstein radius determination from
position of images). We apply such a method to a combined gravitational lens
data set including 70 data points from Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) and Lens
Structure and Dynamics survey (LSD). On the other hand, a new sample of 10
lensing galaxy clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 carefully
selected from strong gravitational lensing systems with both X-ray satellite
observations and optical giant luminous arcs, is also used to constrain three
dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, constant $w$ and CPL) under a flat universe
assumption. For the full sample ($n=80$) and the restricted sample ($n=46$)
including 36 two-image lenses and 10 strong lensing arcs, we obtain relatively
good fitting values of basic cosmological parameters, which generally agree

the only known X-ray binary consisting of a hot sub-dwarf and a white dwarf.
The white dwarf rotates very rapidly (P=13.2 s) and has a dynamically measured
mass of 1.28+/-0.05 M_sun. Its X-ray emission consists of a strongly pulsed,
soft component, well fit by a blackbody with kT~40 eV, accounting for most of
the luminosity, and a fainter hard power-law component (photon index ~1.6). A
luminosity of ~10^{32} erg/s is produced by accretion onto the white dwarf of
the helium-rich matter from the wind of the companion, which is one of the few
hot sub-dwarfs showing evidence of mass-loss. A search for optical pulsations
at the South African Astronomical Observatory 1.9-m telescope gave negative
results. X-rays were detected also during the white dwarf eclipse. This
emission, with luminosity 2x10^{30} erg/s, can be attributed to HD 49798 and
represents the first detection of a hot sub-dwarf star in the X-ray band.
HD49798/RXJ0648.0-4418 is a post-common envelope binary which most likely
originated from a pair of stars with masses ~8-10 M_sun. After the current
He-burning phase, HD 49798 will expand and reach the Roche-lobe, causing a
higher accretion rate onto the white dwarf which can reach the Chandrasekhar
limit. Considering the fast spin of the white dwarf, this could lead to the
formation of a millisecond pulsar. Alternatively, this system could be a Type
Ia supernova progenitor with the appealing characteristic of a short time
delay, being the descendent of relatively massive stars.

that a rotation of astrophysical jets can be caused by magnetohydrodynamic
shocks in a helical magnetic field. Shock compression of the helical magnetic
field results in a toroidal Lorentz force component which will accelerate the
jet material in toroidal direction. This process transforms magnetic angular
momentum (magnetic stress) carried along the jet into kinetic angular momentum
(rotation). The mechanism proposed here only works in a helical magnetic field
configuration. We demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism by axisymmetric
MHD simulations in 1.5D and 2.5D using the PLUTO code. In our setup the jet is
injected into the ambient gas with zero kinetic angular momentum (no rotation).
Different dynamical parameters for jet propagation are applied such as the jet
internal Alfven Mach number and fast magnetosonic Mach number, the density
contrast of jet to ambient medium, or the external sonic Mach number of the
jet. The mechanism we suggest should work for a variety of jet applications,
e.g. protostellar or extragalactic jets, and internal jet shocks (jet knots) or
external shocks between the jet and ambient gas (entrainment). For typical
parameter values for protostellar jets, the numerically derived rotation
feature looks consistent with the observations, i.e. rotational velocities of
0.1-1 percent of the jet bulk velocity.

is suppressed by large inelastic quasi-particle (QP) scattering rate gamma* ~
Delta. In the fully-gapped s-wave state without sign reversal (s++), a
hump-shaped enhancement appears in the neutron spectrum just above 2Delta,
since the inelastic QP scattering is prohibited by the SC gap. That is, the
hump structure is produced by the dissipationless QPs for Ek<3Delta. The
obtained result is more consistent with experimental spectra, compared to the
results of our previous paper with Delta=50meV. On the other hand, both height
and weight of the resonance peak in the fully-gapped s-wave states with sign

associated to interactions of an outflow with the medium. Some of these systems
are, or may be, high-mass binaries harboring young nonaccreting pulsars, in
which the stellar and the pulsar winds collide, generating a powerful outflow
that should terminate at some point in the ambient medium. This work studies
the evolution and termination, as well as the related radiation, of the
shocked-wind flow generated in high-mass binaries hosting powerful pulsars. A
characterization, based on previous numerical work, is given for the
stellar/pulsar wind interaction. Then, an analytical study of the further
evolution of the shocked flow and its dynamical impact on the surrounding
medium is carried out. Finally, the expected nonthermal emission from the flow
termination shock, likely the dominant emitting region, is calculated. The
shocked wind structure, initially strongly asymmetric, becomes a
quasi-spherical, supersonically expanding bubble, with its energy coming from
the pulsar and mass from the stellar wind. This bubble eventually interacts
with the environment on ~pc scales, producing a reverse and, sometimes, a
forward shock. Nonthermal leptonic radiation can be efficient in the reverse
shock. Radio emission is expected to be faint, whereas X-rays can easily reach
detectable fluxes. Under very low magnetic fields and large nonthermal
luminosities, gamma rays may also be significant. We conclude that the
complexity of the stellar/pulsar wind interaction is likely to be smoothed out
outside the binary system, where the wind-mixed flow accelerates and eventually
terminates in a strong reverse shock. This shock may be behind the extended
X-rays observed in some binary systems. For very powerful pulsars, part of the
unshocked pulsar wind may directly interact with the large-scale environment.

clustering algorithm, which is adaptive to the heterogeneous model. This
algorithm enables the nodes to select the cluster head according to factors
such as energy and communication cost, thus the nodes with higher residual
energy have higher probability to become a cluster head than those with lower
residual energy, so that the network energy can be dissipated uniformly. In
order to reduce energy consumption when broadcasting in clustering phase and
prolong network lifetime, an energy consumption prediction model is established
for regular data acquisition nodes. Simulation results show that compared with
current clustering algorithms, this algorithm can achieve longer sensor network

momentum (OAM) emerge as a new tool in high-energy physics. Recently, it was
suggested to generate high-energy photons with non-zero OAM (twisted photons)
by the Compton backscattering of laser twisted photons on relativistic electron
beams. Twisted electrons in the intermediate energy range have also been
demostrated experimentally; twisted protons and other particles can in
principle be created in a similar way. Collisions of energetic twisted states
can offer a new look at particle properties and interactions. A theoretical
description of twisted particle scattering developed previously treated them as
pure Bessel states and ran into difficulty when describing the OAM of the final
twisted particle at non-zero scattering angles. Here we develop further this
formalism by incorporating two additional important features. First, we treat
the initial OAM state as a wave packet of a finite transverse size rather than
a pure Bessel state. This realistic assumption allows us to resolve the
existing controversy between two theoretical analyses for non-forward
scattering. Second, we describe the final twisted particle in terms of the
orbital helicity --- the OAM projection on its average direction of propagation
rather than on the fixed reaction axis. Using this formalism, we determine to
what extent the twisted state is transferred from the initial to final OAM
particle in a generic scattering kinematics. As a particular application, we
prove that in the Compton backscattering the orbital helicity of the final
photon stays close to the OAM projection of the initial photon.

friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health
that include race, gender, and school year as covariates. We employ a
stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm to fit a logistic regression
model that includes these explanatory variables as well as a latent stochastic
blockmodel component and additional node-specific effects. Although
maximum-likelihood estimates do not appear consistent in this context, we are
able to evaluate confidence sets as a function of different blockmodel
partitions, which enables us to qualitatively assess the significance of
estimated residual network structure relative to a baseline, which models
covariates but lacks block structure.

three-patches particles. For all the compositions we find in the vDOS a
pronounced peak at low frequency whose height grows on increasing the fraction

with the vDOS of a long linear chain of two-patches particles and we find that

zero-force condition that makes the branes ""float along"" at constant speed, or
soar, requires the velocity to be purely imaginary. While these probes are not
physical, their no-force condition implies the existence of hidden relations
between the warp factors and electric potentials of non-extremal solutions in
certain duality frames, and this provides insight into the structure of such
solutions and can greatly simplify the search for them.

Stardust mission. Meanwhile, observations of the distribution of hot minerals
in young stellar systems suggest that these materials were produced in the
inner part of the primordial nebula and have been transported outward in the
formation zone of comets. We investigate the possibility that photophoresis
provides a viable mechanism to transport high-temperature materials from the
inner solar system to the regions in which the comets were forming. We use a
grid of time-dependent disk models of the solar nebula to quantify the distance
range at which hot minerals can be transported from the inner part of the disk
toward its outer regions as a function of their size and density. The particles
considered here are in the form of aggregates that presumably were assembled
from hot mineral individual grains ranging down to submicron sizes and formed
by condensation within the hottest portion of the solar nebula. Our
particle-transport model includes the photophoresis, radiation pressure, and
gas drag. Depending on the postulated disk parameters and the density of
particles, 10-2 to 10-1 m aggregates can reach heliocentric distances up to 35
AU in the primordial nebula over very short timescales (no more than a few
hundred thousand years). 10-3 m particles follow the same trajectory as the
larger ones but their maximum migration distance does not exceed 26 AU and is
reached at later epochs in the disks. On the other hand, 10-5 to 10-4 m
aggregates are continuously pushed outward during the evolution of the solar
nebula. Our simulations suggest that irrespective of the employed solar nebula
model, photophoresis is a mechanism that can explain the presence of hot
temperature minerals in the formation region of comets.

Finally, the unification in the framework of quantum field theories remains an

theory, even at large distances. As long as those ""dark sides"" of the universe

simultaneously (1) guides the sampling such that hypotheses corresponding to
all true structures can be quickly retrieved and (2) filters the hypotheses
such that only a small but very promising subset remain. This permits the usage
of simple agglomerative clustering on the surviving hypotheses for accurate

carried out between a bulk and a nanometric sample (grain size ~ 60 nm)

magnetic field - temperature history. The magnetoresistance of the samples also
show strong irreversibility with respect to sweeping of the field between
highest positive and negative values. Moreover, resistivity is found to
increase with time after field cooling and then switching off the field. All
these phenomena have been attributed to phase separation effect and arrest of
phases in the samples. Furthermore, the bulk sample displays a spin glass like
behaviour as evident from frequency dependence of linear ac magnetic
susceptibility and critical divergence of the nonlinear ac magnetic
susceptibility. The experimentally obtained characteristic time t after
dynamical scaling analysis of the frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility
is found to be t=10-17 s which implies that the system is different from a
canonical spin glass. An unusual frequency dependence of the second harmonic of
ac susceptibility around the magnetic transition temperature led us to
designate the magnetic state of the sample to be glassy ferromagnetic. On
reduction of grain size low field magnetoresistance and phase arrest phenomena
are found to enhance but the glassy state is observed to be destabilized in the

diffuse foreground emission components from the Milky Way. We employ simple
kurtosis statistic as the measure of non-Gaussian properties and perform a
linear combination of 5 frequency maps provided by Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in its 7 year data release in such a way that the
cleaned map has a minimum kurtosis which leads to a non-Gaussianity minimized,
foreground cleaned CMB map. We validate the method by performing Monte-Carlo
simulations. To minimize any residual foreground contamination from the cleaned
map we flag out region near the galactic plane based upon results from
simulations. Outside the masked region our new estimate of CMB map matches well
with the WMAP's ILC map. A simple pseudo-$C_l$ based CMB TT power spectrum
derived from the non-gaussianity minimized map reproduces the earlier results

does not introduce any negative bias in angular power spectrum in low multipole

the tensor gauge field, which has certain relation to gravitation. Similarly to
the vector case, we find a nice feature that after removing all gauge degrees
of freedom the angular momentum of the tensor gauge field vanishes for a
stationary system. This angular momentum also shows a one-parameter invariance
over the infinitely many ways of complete gauge fixing for the tensor field.
The tensor gauge coupling, however, does exhibit a critical difference from the
vector gauge coupling that it may induce intrinsic interaction terms into the
spatial translation and rotation generators, leaving none of the ten Poincar\'e
generators interaction-free.

that the CO2 bands at 4.2 micron in three brown dwarfs are much stronger than
expected from the unified cloudy model (UCM) based on recent solar C & O
abundances. This result has been a puzzle, but we now find that this is simply
an abundance effect: We show that these strong CO2 bands can be explained with
the UCMs based on the classical C & O abundances (log Ac and log Ao), which are
about 0.2 dex larger compared to the recent values. Since three other brown
dwarfs could be well interpreted with the recent solar C & O abundances, we
require at least two model sequences based on the different chemical
compositions to interpret all the AKARI spectra. The reason for this is that
the CO2 band is especially sensitive to C & O abundances, since the CO2
abundance depends approximately on AcAo^2 --- the cube of C & O abundances. For
this reason, even low resolution spectra of very cool dwarfs, especially of CO2
cannot be understood unless a model with proper abundances is applied. For the
same reason, CO2 is an excellent indicator of C & O abundances, and we can now
estimate C & O abundances of brown dwarfs: Three out of six brown dwarfs
observed with AKARI should have high C & O abundances similar to the classical
solar values (e.g. logAc = 8.60 and logAo = 8.92), but the other three may have
low C & O abundances similar to the recent solar values (e.g. logAc = 8.39 and
logAo = 8.69). This result implies that three out of six brown dwarfs are
highly metal rich relative to the Sun if the recent solar C & O abundances are
correct.

based on the impossibility of infinite descent. To this end we use a program
abstraction in which transitions are described by Monotonicity Constraints over

allowed, we have size-change graphs. In the last decade, both theory and
practice have evolved significantly in this restricted framework. The crucial
underlying assumption of most of the past work is that the domain of the
variables is well-founded. In a recent paper I showed how to extend and adapt
some theory from the domain of size-change graphs to general monotonicity
constraints, thus complementing previous work, but remaining in the realm of
well-founded domains. However, monotonicity constraints are, interestingly,
capable of proving termination also in the integer domain, which is not
well-founded. The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of
monotonicity constraints in this domain. We lay the necessary theoretical
foundation, and present precise decision procedures for termination; finally,
we provide a procedure to construct explicit global ranking functions from
monotonicity constraints in singly-exponential time, and of optimal worst-case

goals are prioritised by the modeller. In this note, we consider the problem of
classifying the elements of a parameter ensemble above or below a given

unweighted-- are formulated. The weighted TCL can be used to emphasize the
estimation of false positives over false negatives or the converse. We prove
that the weighted and unweighted TCLs are optimized by the ensembles of
unit-specific posterior quantiles and posterior medians, respectively. In
addition, we relate these classification loss functions on parameter ensembles
to the concepts of posterior sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we find some
relationships between the unweighted TCL and the absolute value loss, which
explain why both functions are minimized by posterior medians.
