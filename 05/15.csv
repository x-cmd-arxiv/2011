boundary condition in the lattice sites located on the particle boundaries. The
focus on the lattice sites, instead of the links between them, as done in the
more used methods, represents a great simplification in the algorithm. A fully
description of the method will be presented, in addition to simulations
comparing the proposed method with other methods and, also, with experimental

ideas from random networks we investigate the effect of connectivity on
transport. In particular, we argue that the presence of disorder in the
topology of vertices crucially modifies the transport features of a network:
irregular networks involve homogeneous segments and have a bimodal distribution
of edge densities, whereas regular networks are dominated by shocks leading to
a unimodal density distribution. The proposed numerical approach of solving for
mean-field transport on networks provides a general framework for studying
TASEP on large networks, and is expected to generalize to other transport
processes.

a hadron, including transverse profile, and is also non-perturbative
information necessary in describing a variety of hard processes, such as meson
leptoproduction and double deeply virtual Compton scattering (DDVCS). In order
to unveil non-perturbative aspects of GPD, we study DDVCS at small $x$ in
gravitational dual description. Using the complex spin $j$-plane representation
of DDVCS amplitude, we show that GPD is well-defined and can be extracted from
the amplitude even in the strong coupling regime. It also turns out that the
saddle point value in the $j$-plane representation plays an important role;
there are two phases in the imaginary part of the amplitude of DDVCS and GPD,
depending on relative position of the saddle point and the leading pole in the
$j$-plane, and crossover between them is induced by the change of the
kinematical variables. The saddle point value also directly controls
kinematical variable dependence of many observables in one of the two phases,
and indeed the dependence is qualitatively in nice agreement with HERA
measurements. Such observation that the gravity dual shares basic properties of
the real world QCD suggests that information from BFKL theory might be used to
reduce error in the gravity dual predictions of the form factor and of GPD.

largest integer $k$ that $G$ admits a proper coloring by $k$ colors, such that

of the other color classes. El Sahili and Kouider [About b-colorings of regular

true that every $d$-regular graph $G$ of girth at least 5 satisfies

Discrete Appl. Math. 157 (2009), 1787-1793] showed that the Petersen graph
provides a negative answer to this question, and then conjectured that the
Petersen graph is the only exception. In this paper, we investigate a
strengthened form of the question.
  The edge connectivity of a graph $G$, denoted by $\lambda(G)$, is the minimum
cardinality of a subset $U$ of $E(G)$ such that $G\setminus U$ is either
disconnected or a graph with only one vertex. A $d$-regular graph $G$ is called
super-edge-connected if every minimum edge-cut is the set of all edges incident
with a vertex in $G$, i.e., $\lambda(G)=d$ and every minimum edge-cut of $G$
isolates a vertex. We show that if $G$ is a $d$-regular graph that contains no
4-cycle, then $\phi(G)=d+1$ whenever $G$ is not super-edge-connected.

coefficients from global, direct numerical simulations. The subsequent use of
these parameters in mean-field models enables us to compare self-consistent
dynamo models with their mean-field counterparts. So far, this has been done
for a simulation of rotating magnetoconvection and a simple benchmark dynamo,
which are both (quasi-)stationary. Aims. It is shown that chaotically
time-dependent dynamos in a low Rossby number regime may be appropriately
described by corresponding mean-field results. Also, it is pointed out under
which conditions mean-field models do not match direct numerical simulations.
Methods. We solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a rotating,
spherical shell in the Boussinesq approximation. Based on this, we compute
mean-field coefficients for several models with the help of the previously
developed test-field method. The parameterization of the mean electromotive
force by these coefficients is tested against direct numerical simulations. In
addition, we use the determined dynamo coefficients in mean-field models and
compare the outcome with azimuthally averaged fields from direct numerical
simulations. Results. The azimuthally and time-averaged electromotive force in
fast rotating dynamos is sufficiently well parameterized by the set of
determined mean-field coefficients. In comparison to the previously considered
(quasi-)stationary dynamo, the chaotic time-dependence leads to an improved
scale separation and thus to a better agreement between direct numerical
simulations and mean-field results.

studies treatment effect estimation with the method of matching weights. This

with optimal sampling property, and no need for choosing matching algorithm and

weight estimator is developed that has the double robust property, i.e., the
estimator is consistent if either the outcome model or the propensity score

single experiment may have several detectors, each of which can alone be used
to derive an upper limit from the set of detected events, and the experiment
can be run during multiple periods. There can also be more than one experiment
which produces an upper limit. Six methods are discussed for producing a
combined upper limit. These methods all assume use of either the optimum
interval method or the maximum gap method for finding an upper limit in the
face of poorly known background.

Double Chooz will soon present new data. If we expect $\sin\theta_{13}$ to be
0.1-0.2, which is close to the present experimental upper bound, we should not
persist in the paradigm of the tri-bimaximal mixing. We discuss breaking the
tri-bimaximal mixing by adding a simple mass matrix, which could be derived
from some non-Abelian discrete symmetries. It is found that
$\sin\theta_{13}=0.1-0.2$ is expected in our model independent analysis of the
generalized mass matrix for the normal or inverted hierarchical neutrino mass
spectrum. On the other hand, $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ are
expected to be not far from 1/2 and 1/3, respectively. As a typical example, we
also discuss the $A_4$ flavor model with the 1 and 1' flavons, which break the
tri-bimaximal mixing considerably. In this modified version of the Altarelli
and Feruglio model, $\sin\theta_{13}$ is predicted to be around 0.15 in the
case of the normal hierarchical neutrino masses $m_3\gg m_2, m_1$, and 0.2 in
the case of the inverted hierarchy $m_3\ll m_2, m_1$. The form of the neutrino
mass matrix looks rather interesting --- it is suggestive of other discrete
symmetries as well.

Heat shock is a
well-characterized model of cellular dynamics. S. cerevisiae is an appropriate
model organism, since both its protein-protein interaction network
(interactome) and stress response at the gene expression level have been well
characterized. However, the analysis of the reorganization of the yeast
interactome during stress has not been investigated yet. We calculated the
changes of the interaction-weights of the yeast interactome from the changes of
mRNA expression levels upon heat shock. The major finding of our study is that
heat shock induced a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections
of yeast interactome modules. In agreement with this the weighted diameter of
the yeast interactome had a 4.9-fold increase in heat shock. Several key
proteins of the heat shock response became centers of heat shock-induced local
communities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules
after heat shock. The observed changes resemble to a ""stratus-cumulus"" type
transition of the interactome structure, since the unstressed yeast interactome
had a globally connected organization, similar to that of stratus clouds,
whereas the heat shocked interactome had a multifocal organization, similar to
that of cumulus clouds. Our results showed that heat shock induces a partial
disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome. This change
may be rather general occurring in many types of stresses. Moreover, other
complex systems, such as single proteins, social networks and ecosystems may
also decrease their inter-modular links, thus develop more compact modules, and
display a partial disintegration of their global structure in the initial phase
of crisis. Thus, our work may provide a model of a general, system-level
adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.

criterion, whereas ductile materials blunt a sharp crack by plastic responses.
Upon continuous pulling ductile materials exhibit a necking instability which
is dominated by a plastic flow. Usually one discusses the brittle to ductile
transition as a function of increasing temperature. We introduce an athermal
brittle to ductile transition as a function of the cut-off length of the
inter-particle potential. On the basis of extensive numerical simulations of
the response to pulling the material boundaries at a constant speed we offer an
explanation of the onset of ductility via the increase in the density of
plastic modes as a function of the potential cutoff length. Finally we can
resolve an old riddle: in experiments brittle materials can be strained under
grip boundary conditions, and exhibit a dynamic crack when cut with a
sufficiently long initial slot. Mysteriously, in molecular dynamics simulations
it appeared that cracks refused to propagate dynamically under grip boundary
conditions, and continuous pulling was necessary to achieve fracture. We argue
that this mystery is removed when one understands the distinction between
brittle and ductile athermal amorphous materials.

theory (PFMT). In particular, we apply our model calculations to determine the
electronic conductance for freely suspended monatomic linear sodium wires
(MLNaW) between leads of the same element, and for the diatomic copper-cobalt
wires (DLCuCoW) between copper leads on a Cu(111) substrate. Calculations for
the MLNaW system confirm the correctness and functionality of our PFMT
approach. We present novel transmission spectra for this system, and show that
its transport properties exhibit the conductance oscillations for the odd- and
even-number wires in agreement with previously reported first-principle
results. The numerical calculations for the DLCuCoW wire nanojunctions are
motivated by the stability of these systems at low temperatures. Our results
for the transmission spectra yield for this system, at its Fermi energy, a
monotonic exponential decay of the conductance with increasing wire length of
the Cu-Co pairs. This is a cumulative effect which is discussed in detail in
the present work, and may prove useful for applications in nanocircuits.
Furthermore, our PFMT formalism can be considered as a compact and efficient
tool for the study of the electronic quantum transport for a wide range of
nanomaterial wire systems. It provides a trade-off in computational efficiency
and predictive capability as compared to slower first-principle based methods,

classification tasks. Traditionally, feature selection methods are designed to
obtain a feature subset that can lead to high classification accuracy. However,
classification accuracy has recently been shown to be an inappropriate
performance metric of classification systems in many cases. Instead, the Area
Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and its multi-class
extension, MAUC, have been proved to be better alternatives. Hence, the target
of classification system design is gradually shifting from seeking a system
with the maximum classification accuracy to obtaining a system with the maximum
AUC/MAUC. Previous investigations have shown that traditional feature selection
methods need to be modified to cope with this new objective. These methods most
often are restricted to binary classification problems only. In this study, a
filter feature selection method, namely MAUC Decomposition based Feature
Selection (MDFS), is proposed for multi-class classification problems. To the
best of our knowledge, MDFS is the first method specifically designed to select
features for building classification systems with maximum MAUC. Extensive
empirical results demonstrate the advantage of MDFS over several compared
feature selection methods.

self-repelling motion"", a one-dimensional self-interacting process introduced
by Toth and Werner, that has very different path properties than usual
diffusion processes. We then use these estimates to study certain of these path
properties such as its law of iterated logarithms for both small and large
times.

out of equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems. By extending theoretical ideas
based on the assumption that time-reparametrization invariance develops
asymptotically we deduce the scaling properties of diverse high-order
correlation functions. We examine these predictions with numerical tests in a
standard glassy model, the 3d Edwards-Anderson spin-glass, and in a system
where time-reparametrization invariance is not expected to hold, the 2d
ferromagnetic Ising model, both at low temperatures. Our results enlighten a
qualitative difference between the fluctuation properties of the two models and
show that scaling properties conform to the time-reparametrization invariance
scenario in the former but not in the latter.

and noncommutative motives. Making use of Hochschild homology, we introduce the
category NNum(k)_F of noncommutative numerical motives (over a base ring k and
with coefficients in a field F). We prove that NNum(k)_F is abelian semi-simple
and that Grothendieck's category Num(k)_Q of numerical motives embeds in
NNum(k)_Q after being factored out by the action of the Tate object. As an
application we obtain an alternative proof of Jannsen's semi-simplicity result,
which uses the noncommutative world instead of a Weil cohomology.

This general Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism starts with a proper
definition of humanoid's configuration manifold, which is a set of all robot's
active joint angles. Based on the `covariant force law', the general humanoid's
dynamics and control are developed. Autonomous Lagrangian dynamics is
formulated on the associated `humanoid velocity phase space', while autonomous
Hamiltonian dynamics is formulated on the associated `humanoid momentum phase
space'. Neural-like hierarchical humanoid control naturally follows this
geometrical prescription. This purely rotational and autonomous dynamics and
control is then generalized into the framework of modern non-autonomous
biomechanics, defining the Hamiltonian fitness function. The paper concludes
with several simulation examples.
  Keywords: Humanoid robots, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, neural-like
humanoid control, time-dependent biodynamics

  Conference on Lie-Admissible Treatment of Irreversible Processes (ICLATIP-3).
  To appear in Algebras, Groups and Geometries","Hadronic Journal 34, 149-159 (2011)",,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the concept of black hole has been considered very
fascinating by scientists even before the introduction of Einstein's general
relativity. They should be the final result of an irreversible gravitational
collapse of very massive bodies. However, an unsolved problem concerning such
objects is the presence of a space-time singularity in their core. Such a
problem was present starting by the first historical papers concerning black
holes. It is a common opinion that this problem could be solved when a correct
quantum gravity theory will be, finally, constructed. In this work we review a
way to remove black hole singularities at a classical level i.e. without
arguments of quantum gravity. By using a particular non-linear electrodynamics
Lagrangian, an exact solution of Einstein field equations is shown. The
solution prevents the collapsing object to reach the gravitational radius, thus
the final result becomes a black star, i.e. an astrophysical object where both
of singularities and event horizons are removed. Such solution is not only a
mathematical artifice. In fact, this kind of Lagrangian has been recently used
in various analysis in astrophysics, like surface of neutron stars and pulsars.
The authors also recently adapted the analysis on a cosmological context by
showing that the big-bang singularity can be removed too.
