Quantum systems are interpreted as symbolic representations of such fields (not

model is intended for simulation of transient enhanced diffusion including
redistribution of ion-implanted boron during low temperature annealing. The
following mechanisms of boron diffusion were proposed, namely: the mechanism of
a long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron interstitials and the mechanism
due to the formation, migration, and dissolution of the ""impurity atom -
silicon self-interstitial"" pairs. Based on the model, simulation of the
redistribution of boron implanted into silicon substrates for annealing
temperatures of 800 and 900 Celsius degrees was carried out. The calculated
boron concentration profiles agree well with the experimental data. It was
shown that for a temperature of 800 Celsius degrees the transport of impurity
atoms occurred due to the long-range migration of nonequilibrium boron
interstitials generated during cluster transformation or dissolution. On the
other hand, it was found that at a temperature of 900 Celsius degrees the pair
diffusion mechanism played a main role in the significant transient enhanced
diffusion. A number of parameters describing the transport of nonequilibrium
boron interstitials and transient enhanced diffusion of substitutionally
dissolved boron atoms were determined. For example, it was found that at a
temperature of 900 Celsius degrees the time-average enhancement of boron
diffusion was approximately equal to 44 times. The results obtained are
important for the development of methods of transient enhanced diffusion
suppression keeping in mind the scaling of the dimensions of silicon integrated
microcircuits.

bct-U phase. The enthalpy differences between the bct and bcc phase decrease
with pressure, but bcc is energetically unfavorable at least up to 1.3 TPa, the

multiverses except Tegmark's <<mathematical multiverse>> are too small to
explain the fine tuning, so that they merely shift the problem up one level.
But the <<mathematical multiverse>> is surely too large. To prove this
assessment, we have performed a number of experiments with cellular automata of
complex behavior, which can be considered as universes in the mathematical
multiverse. The analogy between what happens in some automata (in particular
Conway's <<Game of Life>>) and the real world is very strong. But if the
results of our experiments can be extrapolated to our universe, we should
expect to inhabit -- in the context of the multiverse -- a world in which at
least some of the laws and constants of nature should show a certain time
dependence. Actually, the probability of our existence in a world such as ours
would be mathematically equal to zero. In consequence, the results presented in
this paper can be considered as an inkling that the hypothesis of the

obtain performance guarantees. Unfortunately, in the real world, sensing
matrices do not always come from random processes. It is therefore desirable to
evaluate whether an arbitrary matrix, or frame, is suitable for sensing sparse
signals. To this end, the present paper investigates two parameters that
measure the coherence of a frame: worst-case and average coherence. We first
provide several examples of frames that have small spectral norm, worst-case
coherence, and average coherence. Next, we present a new lower bound on
worst-case coherence and compare it to the Welch bound. Later, we propose an
algorithm that decreases the average coherence of a frame without changing its
spectral norm or worst-case coherence. Finally, we use worst-case and average
coherence, as opposed to the Restricted Isometry Property, to garner
near-optimal probabilistic guarantees on both sparse signal detection and
reconstruction in the presence of noise. This contrasts with recent results
that only guarantee noiseless signal recovery from arbitrary frames, and which
further assume independence across the nonzero entries of the signal---in a
sense, requiring small average coherence replaces the need for such an
assumption.

investigate the relative contribution of these effects to the cross-helicity

distributed mean-field model and a flux-transport dynamo model. We show that
the contribution from the density stratification follows the evolution of the
radial magnetic field, while large-scale electric currents produce a more
complicated pattern of the cross-helicity of the comparable magnitude. We
suggest that the results of observational analysis of the cross-helicity will
depend on the averaging scales. Our results show that the pattern of the

asymptotically high energies, the energy loss in static and dynamical medium
approach the same value, we find that the physical origin of the energy loss in
these two cases is different.

  We apply the developed formalism to radio monitoring data for Cyg X-1, which
allows us to obtain strong constraints on the structure of its inner jet. With
the data at 15 GHz, and taking into account an anisotropy of the stellar wind
in Cyg X-1, we estimate the location of the peak of that emission along the jet
at about one orbital separation, i.e., $\sim 3\times 10^{12}$ cm. Given a
previous determination of the turnover frequency in Cyg X-1, this implies the
location of the base of the jet at $\sim 10^3$ gravitational radii. We also
obtain corresponding results at 8.3 GHz and 2.25 GHz, which roughly follow the
standard conical partially self-absorbed jet model. Furthermore, we find that
the level of the orbital modulation depends on the radio flux, with the
modulation being substantially stronger when the radio flux is lower. This is
explained by the height of the radio emission along the jet decreasing with the
decreasing radio flux, as predicted by jet models. Based on the finding of the
flux-dependent orbital modulation, we are able to estimate a range of the
possible changes of the form of the radio/X-ray correlation in Cyg X-1 due to
free-free absorption. We also derive predictions for the orbital modulation and

larger critical radius $r_c$ for the percolation of their continuum percolation
models than spatially homogeneous point processes. It has already been shown,
and we reaffirm it in this paper, that the $dcx$ ordering of point processes is
suitable to compare their clustering tendencies. Hence, it was tempting to
conjecture that $r_c$ is increasing in $dcx$ order. Some numerical evidences
support this conjecture for a special class of point processes, called
perturbed lattices, which are ""toy models"" for determinantal and permanental
point processes. However, the conjecture is not true in full generality, since
one can construct a Cox point process with degenerate critical radius $r_c=0$,
that is $dcx$ larger than a given homogeneous Poisson point process.
Nevertheless, we are able to compare some nonstandard critical radii related,
respectively, to the finiteness of the expected number of void circuits around
the origin and asymptotic of the expected number of long occupied paths from
the origin in suitable discrete approximations of the continuum model. These
new critical radii sandwich the ""true"" one. Surprisingly, the inequalities for
them go in opposite directions, which gives uniform lower and upper bounds on
$r_c$ for all processes $dcx$ smaller than some given process. In fact, the
above results hold under weaker assumptions on the ordering of void
probabilities or factorial moment measures only. Examples of point processes
comparable to Poisson processes in this weaker sense include determinantal and
permanental processes. More generally, we show that point processes $dcx$
smaller than homogeneous Poisson processes exhibit phase transitions in certain
percolation models based on the level-sets of additive shot-noise fields, as
e.g. $k$-percolation and SINR-percolation.

noncrossing if there are no two arcs of the same color that are intersecting.
We show that oscillating domino tableaux with at most two columns are in

that knowledge of many short-distance processes at next-to-leading order may be

show, based on simulations, that much could be learnt about friction by
sliding, via e.g. an electric field, the trapped ion chains over a periodic
corrugated potential. Unlike infinite chains where, according to theory, the
classic Aubry transition to free sliding may take place, trapped chains are
always pinned. Nonetheless we find that a properly defined static friction
still vanishes Aubry-like at a symmetric-asymmetric structural transition,
ubiquitous for decreasing corrugation in both straight and zig-zag trapped

could thus become exquisitely accessible in future cold ion tribology.

altitude no higher than the bottom of the field of view of LASCO C2. In
addition, all front-side CMEs have accompanying flares. These common
observational features shed light on the excitation conditions of streamer wave
events.
  We also conduct a further analysis on one specific streamer wave event on 5
June 2003. The heliocentric distances of 4 wave troughs/crests at various
exposure times are determined; they are then used to deduce the wave properties
like period, wavelength, and phase speeds. It is found that both the period and
wavelength increase gradually with the wave propagation along the streamer
plasma sheet, and the phase speed of the preceding wave is generally faster
than that of the trailing ones. The associated coronal seismological study
yields the radial profiles of the Alfv\'en speed and magnetic field strength in
the region surrounding the streamer plasma sheet. Both quantities show a
general declining trend with time. This is interpreted as an observational
manifestation of the recovering process of the CME-disturbed corona. It is also
found that the Alfv\'enic critical point is at about 10 R$_\odot$ where the

intrinsically dynamic and nonlinear, and are subject to non-negligible amounts
of random fluctuations. Such conditions are ubiquitous in physical systems,
where they have been studied for decades using the tools of statistical and
nonlinear physics. The goal of this review is to show how approaches
traditionally used in physics can help in reaching a systems-level
understanding of living cells. To that end, we present an overview of the
dynamical phenomena exhibited by genetic circuits and their functional
significance. We also describe the theoretical and experimental approaches that
are being used to unravel the relationship between circuit structure and
function in dynamical cellular processes under the influence of noise, both at
the single-cell level and in cellular populations, where intercellular coupling
plays an important role.

arbitrarily small perfect fluid pressures are introduced in the classic black
hole formation scenario as described by Oppenheimer, Snyder and Datt (OSD) [1].
This extends a previous result on tangential pressures [2] to the more
physically realistic scenario of perfect fluid collapse. The existence of
classes of pressure perturbations is shown explicitly, which has the property
that injecting any smallest pressure changes the final fate of the dynamical
collapse from a black hole to a naked singularity. It is therefore seen that
any smallest neighborhood of the OSD model, in the space of initial data,
contains collapse evolutions that go to a naked singularity outcome. This gives
an intriguing insight on the nature of naked singularity formation in
gravitational collapse.

integral values on the control points of the original time series data; the EEF
can be obtained from the derivative of the spline function passing through the
integral values on the control points. By choosing control points with
different criteria, the EEF can be used to find the intrinsic mode
function(IMF, fluctuation) and the residue (trend); to fit the curve of the
original data function; and to take samples on original data with equivalent
effect. As examples of application, results of trend and fluctuation on real
stock historical data are calculated on different time scales. A new approach
to extend the EEF to 2D intrinsic mode decomposition is introduced to resolve
the inter slice non continuity problem, some photo image decomposition examples
are presented.

near-kagome quantum magnet vesignieite, Cu3BaV2O8(OH)2, are presented as

intrinsic susceptibility of the kagome sites which closely resembles that of
the quantum spin liquid herbertsmithite [A. Olariu et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 100,
087202 (2008)]. It is therefore surprising that, at Tc ~ 9 K, a transition to a
heterogeneous ground state is observed. A gradual wipeout of half the NMR
intensity indicates a slowly fluctuating spin liquid component and a detailed
analysis of the linewidth reveals the onset of static magnetism at the
remaining half of the sites. It is proposed that this transition and unusual
ground state originate from a nearby quantum critical point induced by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

for the purpose of assessing the feasibility of an acoustic neutrino detection
array at the South Pole. The SPATS hardware consists of four vertical strings
deployed in the upper 500 m of the South Pole ice cap. The strings form a
trapezoidal array with a maximum baseline of 543 m. Each string has 7 stages
equipped with one transmitter and one sensor module. Sound is detected or
generated by piezoelectric ceramic elements inside the modules. Analogue
signals are sent to the surface on electric cables where they are digitized by
a PC-based data acquisition system. The data from all strings are collected on
a central computer in the IceCube Laboratory from where they are send to a
central data storage facility via a satellite link or stored locally on tape. A
technical overview of SPATS and its performance is presented.

related to each of $N$ servers and through comparing the numbers of customers
in these orbits, we introduce a retrial supermarket model of $N$ identical
servers, where two probing-server choice numbers are respectively designed for
dynamically allocating each primary arrival and each retrial arrival into these
orbits when the chosen servers are all busy. Note that the designed purpose of
the two choice numbers can effectively improve performance measures of this
retrial supermarket model.
  This paper analyzes a simple and basic retrial supermarket model of N
identical servers, that is, Poisson arrivals, exponential service and retrial
times. To this end, we first provide a detailed probability computation to set
up an infinite-dimensional system of differential equations (or mean-field
equations) satisfied by the expected fraction vector. Then, as N goes to
infinity, we apply the operator semigroup to obtaining the mean-field limit (or
chaos of propagation) for the sequence of Markov processes which express the
state of this retrial supermarket model. Specifically, some simple and basic
conditions for the mean-field limit as well as for the Lipschitz condition are
established through the first two moments of the queue length in any orbit.
Finally, we show that the fixed point satisfies a system of nonlinear equations
which is an interesting networking generalization of the tail equations given
in the M/M/1 retrial queue, and also use the fixed point to give performance
analysis of this retrial supermarket model through numerical computation.

existence of appropriate kinds of accumulation points for arbitrary sequences
on some fixed index set (Corollary 3.5).
  We discuss corresponding notions related to sequential compactness, and to
pseudocompactness, or, more generally, properties connected with the existence
of limit points of sequences of subsets. In spite of the great generality of
our treatment, many results here appear to be new even in very special cases,
such as $D$-compactness and $D$-pseudocompactness, for $D$ an ultrafilter, and
weak (quasi) $M$-(pseudo)-compactness, for $M$ a set of ultrafilters, as well
