However, if a group of nodes do not cooperate, the performance of the DSR

Simulations results of the model show that the effect of the attack is

quasars with $0.4<z<0.8$ is studied. This low redshift sample is useful since
any corresponding FIRST radio observations are sensitive enough to detect
extended flux in even the weakest FR II radio sources. In the sample, 2.7% of
the sources have detectable extended emission on larger than galactic scales
($>$ 20 - 30 kpc). The frequency of quasars with FR II level extended radio
emission is $\approx 2.3%$ and $>0.4%$ of quasars have FR I level extended
radio emission. The lower limit simply reflects the flux density limit of the
survey. The distribution of the long term time averaged jet powers of these
quasars, $\bar{Q}$, has a broad peak $\sim 3\times 10^{44}$ ergs/sec that turns
over below below $10^{44}$ ergs/sec and sources above $10^{45}$ ergs/sec are
extremely rare. It is found that the correlation between the bolometric (total
thermal) luminosity of the accretion flow, $L_{bol}$, and $\bar{Q}$ is not
strong. The correlation of $\bar{Q}$ with narrow line luminosity is stronger
than the correlation with broad line luminosity and the continuum luminosity.
It is therefore concluded that previous interpretations of correlations of
$\bar{Q}$ with narrow line strengths in radio galaxies as a direct correlation
of jet power and accretion power have been overstated. It is explained why this
interpretation mistakenly overlooks the sizeable fraction of sources with weak
accretion luminosity and powerful jets discovered by Ogle et al (2006).

kiloparsec of the E0 LINER/Seyfert 1 galaxy Arp102B. The arms are observed in
H-alpha emission and located East and West of the nucleus, extending up to
about 1 kpc from it. We use narrow-band imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope
Advanced Camera for Surveys, in combination with archival VLA radio images at
3.6 and 6 cm to investigate the origin of the nuclear spiral. From the H-alpha
luminosity of the spiral, we obtain an ionized gas mass of the order of one
million solar masses. One possibility is that the nuclear spiral represents a
gas inflow triggered by a recent accretion event which has replenished the
accretion disk, giving rise to the double-peaked emission-line profiles
characteristic of Arp102B. However, the radio images show a one-sided curved
jet which correlates with the eastern spiral arm observed in the H-alpha image.
A published milliarcsecond radio image also shows one-sided structure at
position angle about 40 degrees, approximately aligned with the inner part of
the eastern spiral arm. The absence of a radio counter-part to the western
spiral arm is tentatively interpreted as indicating that the jet is
relativistic, with an estimated speed of 0.45c. Estimates of the jet kinetic
energy and the ionizing luminosity of the active nucleus indicate that both are
capable of ionizing the gas along the spiral arms. We conclude that, although
the gas in the nuclear region may have originated in an accretion event, the
mini-spiral is most likely the result of a jet-cloud interaction rather than an
inflowing stream.

to a class of topological quantum Dp-branes as well to KK theory. These branes
emerge when there are non-trivial NS-NS H-fluxes where the topological classes
are determined by wild embeddings S^2 -> S^3. Then wild embeddings of higher

exotic smoothness as well Casson handles. Next we build C*-algebras
corresponding to the embeddings. Finally we consider topological quantum
D-branes as those which emerge from wild embeddings in question. We construct
an action for these quantum D-branes and show that the classical limit agrees
with the Born-Infeld action such that flat branes = usual embeddings.

efficiency and quality, we propose to use a single analog error correction code

is to get analog coding right. We show that this can be achieved by cleverly
exploiting an elegant ""butterfly"" property of chaotic systems. Specifically, we
demonstrate a tail-biting triple-branch baker's map code and its
maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed

state-of-the-art implementations of push-relabel and augmenting path algorithms
that are specifically designed to solve these problems. The experiments show
that the pseudoflow variants are in most cases faster than the other

  We also show that one particular implementation---the matching pseudoflow
algorithm---is theoretically efficient. For a graph with $n$ nodes, $m$ arcs,
$n_1$ the size of the smaller set in the bipartition, and the maximum matching
value $\kappa \leq n_1$, the algorithm's complexity given input in the form of
adjacency lists is $O(\min{n_1\kappa,m} + \sqrt{\kappa}\min{\kappa^2,m})$.
Similar algorithmic ideas are shown to work for an adaptation of Hopcroft and

operations on words of size $\lambda$, the complexity of the pseudoflow
algorithm is further improved to $O(\min{n_1\kappa, \frac{n_1n_2}{\lambda}, m}

wave packet appears to spread like a free particle, albeit more slowly. It is
argued that, on some scales (lower than the Planck scale), this theory predicts
significant deviation from conventional (linear) quantum mechanics. However,
owing to the difficulty of controlling quantum coherence on the one hand, and
the weakness of gravity on the other, definitive experimental falsification
poses a technologically formidable challenge.

the solution of a deterministic differential delay equation. To study this we
analytically study the bifurcation properties of an apparently simple
differential delay equation and then numerically investigate the probabilistic
properties of chaotic solutions of the same equation. Our results show that
solutions of the deterministic equation with randomly selected initial
conditions display a Gaussian-like density for long time, but the densities are
supported on an interval of finite measure. Using these chaotic solutions as
velocities, we are able to produce Brownian-like motions, which show
statistical properties akin to those of a classical Brownian motion over both
short and long time scales. Several conjectures are formulated for the
probabilistic properties of the solution of the differential delay equation.
Numerical studies suggest that these conjectures could be ""universal"" for
similar types of ""chaotic"" dynamics, but we have been unable to prove this.

density matrix becomes nearly diagonal, where the states giving extrema of
interaction energy are privileged to describe the quantum decoherence. This
approach is compatible with the von Neumann's old work, which has been recently
studied with renewed interest: The thermal mixture of states can be reached by
the time average of a density of matrix due to the oscillation phase factor,
$e^{-i(E_i-E_j)t/\hbar}.$ One of the direct results is the localization of

North simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in INTEGRAL
gamma-ray burst (GRB) 080603A, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset of
the GRB. This optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emerging
afterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to X-ray
light curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireball
model. The intrinsic extinction toward GRB 080603A is high (A_V,z = 0.8 mag),
and the well-sampled X-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution is
interesting in requiring an LMC2 extinction profile, in contrast to the
majority of GRBs. Comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected optical
flux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-Compton origin for the prompt
gamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from the
inhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. In this scenario, a large velocity
irregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milder
internal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. Flat
gamma-ray spectra, roughly F propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many GRBs. If the
flat spectrum extends down to the optical band in GRB 080603A, the optical
flare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. If
this is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding the
nature of the emission process in the prompt phase of GRBs and highlights the
importance of deep (R> 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable of
detecting faint, prompt optical emission.

and fitting the SNIa data (Union2), the marginalized likelihood distribution of

increasing, but there might be a tendency that the cosmic acceleration will
slow down in the near future. We also fit the Hubble evolution data together

that the present decelerating expansion is excluded within $2\sigma$ error.
Further exploration on this problem is also approached in a non-parametrization
method by directly reconstructing the deceleration parameter from the distance
modulus of SNIa, which depends neither on the validity of general relativity
nor on the content of the universe or any assumption regarding cosmological

In this new scheme, the theory remains infra-red finite even in the chiral

toward the Fe II type during the pre-maximum halt, and then toward the He/N
type again. This course of spectral transition was observed for the first time
in the long history of the nova research. In the rebrightening stage after the
initial brightness maximum, we could identify many emission lines accompanied
by a stronger absorption component of the P-Cygni profile at the brightness
maxima. We found that the velocity of the P-Cygni absorption component measured
from the emission peak decreased at the brightness maxima. Furthermore, we
compared the spectra of V5558 Sgr with V723 Cas, and other novae which

subsequently decay into meson pairs, MMbar, is an important signature for such
processes at hadron colliders. However there is a potentially important
background from the direct QCD production of meson pairs, as mediated for
example by the exclusive gg --> MMbar hard scattering subprocess. This is in
fact an interesting process in its own right, testing novel aspects of
perturbative QCD technology. We explicitly calculate the gg --> MMbar helicity
amplitudes for different meson states within the hard exclusive formalism, and
comment on the application of MHV techniques to the calculation. Using these
results, we describe how meson pair CEP can be calculated in the perturbative
regime, and present some sample numerical predictions for a variety of final
states. We also briefly consider the dominant non-perturbative contributions,
which are expected to be important when the meson transverse momentum is small.

pulsar is used, rather than the standard glitch model, in the 1360-day interval
after the first glitch. The sampling of the following 260-day is not frequent
enough to be phase-connected. After that interval, our timing analysis yields
that there is a fractional frequency change of
$\frac{\Delta\nu}{\nu}\sim8.20(2)\times10^{-7}$. Moreover, we report two
frequency shifts of fractional changes,
$\frac{\Delta\nu}{\nu}\sim3\times10^{-8},-1\times10^{-8}$: The first one at MJD
$\sim53750$ had a positive fractional frequency change in contrast to the
second one at MJD $\sim54880$ for which the pulse frequency decreased. These

core resemble a very rich filament, while another rich supercluster in the SGW,
SCl~111, resembles a ""multispider"" - an assembly of high density regions
connected by chains of galaxies. Using Minkowski functionals we study the
substructure of individual galaxy populations determined by their color in
these superclusters. We assess the statistical significance of the results with
the halo model and smoothed bootstrap. We study the galaxy content and the
properties of groups of galaxies in two richest superclusters of the SGW,
paying special attention to bright red galaxies (BRGs) and to the first ranked
galaxies in SGW groups. About 1/3 of BRGs are spirals. The scatter of colors of
elliptical BRGs is smaller than that of spiral BRGs. About half of BRGs and of
first ranked galaxies in groups have large peculiar velocities. Groups with
elliptical BRGs as their first ranked galaxies populate superclusters more
uniformly than the groups, which have a spiral BRG as its first ranked galaxy.
The galaxy and group content of the core of the supercluster SCl~126 shows
several differences in comparison with the outskirts of this supercluster and
with the supercluster SCl~111. Our results suggest that the formation history

task. This problem has been devoted a lot of attention in the last decade but
there are still some open issues. First, the control flow graph (CFG) of a
binary program is needed to compute the WCET and this CFG is built using some
internal knowledge of the compiler that generated the binary code; moreover
once constructed the CFG has to be manually annotated with loop bounds. Second,
the algorithms to compute the WCET (combining Abstract Interpretation and
Integer Linear Programming) are tailored for specific architectures: changing
the architecture (e.g. replacing an ARM7 by an ARM9) requires the design of a
new ad hoc algorithm. Third, the tightness of the computed results (obtained
using the available tools) are not compared to actual execution times measured
on the real hardware. In this paper we address the above mentioned problems. We
first describe a fully automatic method to compute a CFG based solely on the
binary program to analyse. Second, we describe the model of the hardware as a
product of timed automata, and this model is independent from the program
description. The model of a program running on a hardware is obtained by
synchronizing (the automaton of) the program with the (timed automata) model of
the hardware. Computing the WCET is reduced to a reachability problem on the
synchronised model and solved using the model-checker UPPAAL. Finally, we
present a rigorous methodology that enables us to compare our computed results
to actual execution times measured on a real platform, the ARM920T.

consider the case of empirically determined fungal networks, and analyze the

growth involves the expansion of fluid filled vessels, which necessarily
involves the movement of fluid. In three empirically determined fungal networks
we found that the minimum currents consistent with the observed growth would
effectively transport resource throughout the network over the time-scale of

two resistivity dropping stages. The first is caused by the normal
superconducting transition, and the second is supposed to be related to the
weak-link between the grains. A model for the resistivity dropping related to
the weak-link behavior is proposed, which is based on the Josephson junctions
formed by the impurities in grain boundaries like FeAs, Sm2O3 and cracks
together with the adjacent grains. These Josephson junctions can be easily
broken by the applied fields and the excitations currents, leading to the
anomalous resistivity tail in many polycrystalline iron-based superconductors.
The calculated resistivity dropping agrees well with the experimental data,

around 25 GPa and 200 K. Further, it does not show any post-tetragonal phase
transition and remains in the tetragonal phase upto 25 GPa at 300 K. The dPc/dT
is found to be positive for the CaFeAsF & CaFe2As2, however the same was not

appears that the closeness of the Fe-As-Fe bond angle to its ideal tetrahedral

low temperature.

three-coordinated silicon. The results show that the nature of adhesion between
graphene and its substrate is qualitatively dependent on the surface defect
type. In particular, the interaction between graphene and silicon-terminated
SiO$_2$ originates exclusively from the vdW interaction, whereas the
oxygen-terminated surface provides additional ionic contribution to the binding
arising from interfacial charge transfer ($p$-type doping of graphene). Strong
doping contrast for the different surface terminations provides a mechanism for
the charge inhomogeneity of graphene on amorphous SiO$_2$ observed in

the typical electronic structure of graphene in the vicinity of the Dirac point
remains unaltered in contact with the SiO$_2$ substrate, which points to the
absence of the covalent interactions between graphene and amorphous silica. The
case of hydrogen-passivated SiO$_2$ surfaces is also examined. In this

the interface distances obtained are shown to be in good agreement with recent

simultaneously satisfying the desired requirements on the distortion level at a

uncertainty-- at an eavesdropper (referred to as Eve). It is further assumed
the presence of a (public) rate-limited link between Alice and Bob. In this
setting, Eve perfectly observes the information bits sent by Alice to Bob and
has also access to a correlated source which can be used as side information. A
second encoder (referred to as Charlie) helps Bob in estimating Alice's source
by sending a compressed version of its own correlated observation via a
(private) rate-limited link, which is only observed by Bob. For instance, the
problem at hands can be seen as the unification between the Berger-Tung and the
secure source coding setups. Inner and outer bounds on the so called
rates-distortion-equivocation region are derived. The inner region turns to be
tight for two cases: (i) uncoded side information at Bob and (ii) lossless
reconstruction of both sources at Bob --secure distributed lossless
compression. Application examples to secure lossy source coding of Gaussian and
binary sources in the presence of Gaussian and binary/ternary (resp.) side
informations are also considered. Optimal coding schemes are characterized for

there is a clear trend in the photon energy as a function of the distance to

perpendicular to the jet axis by Chandra. A comparison of our X-ray data of the
L1551 IRS 5 jet both with models as well as X-ray observations of other

shocks are also consistent with the observed morphology if the supply of jet
material by the ejection of new blobs is sufficiently constant. We conclude
that the study of the X-ray emission of protostellar jet sources allows us to

problem of alloy solidification can be found. In the first, the material in the
diffuse interfaces is assumed to be in an intermediate state between solid and
liquid, with a unique local composition. In the second, the interface is seen
as a mixture of two phases that each retain their macroscopic properties, and a
separate concentration field for each phase is introduced. It is shown here
that both types of models can be obtained by the standard variational procedure
if a grand-potential functional is used as a starting point instead of a
free-energy functional. The dynamical variable is then the chemical potential
instead of the composition. In this framework, a complete analogy with
phase-field models for the solidification of a pure substance can be
established. This analogy is then exploited to formulate quantitative
phase-field models for alloys with arbitrary phase diagrams. The precision of
the method is illustrated by numerical simulations with varying interface
thickness.

blocks are calculated and it is found that when the number of the iterations of
the renormalziation trends infinity, the concurrence develops two staturated
values which are associated with two different phases, i.e., Ising-like and
spin-fluid phases. We also investigate the first derivative of the concurrence,
and find that there exists non-analytic behaviors at the quantum critical
point, which directly associate with the divergence of the correlation length.
Further insight, the scaling behaviors of the system are analyzed, it is shown
that how the maximum value of the first derivative of the concurrence reaches
the infinity and how the critical point is touched as the size of the system
becomes large.

relatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified SB1

behavior consistent with the three-dimensional (3D) XY universality class. We
relate this finding to a 3D Z6 clock model description of the enlarged symmetry

within 35 degrees of the axis of a relativistic radio jet, based on two-epoch
radio flux density variability. It is true if the surface brightness of a radio
source is observed to change by a sufficiently large amount, the inferred
brightness temperature will exceed 10^12 K and Doppler beaming in our direction
must be invoked to avoid a Compton cooling catastrophe. However, flux density
changes cannot be linked to surface brightness changes without knowledge of the
size of the source. If an optically thick source changes in projected area but
not surface brightness, its brightness temperature is constant and its flux
variability yields no constraint on its orientation. Moreover, as pointed out
by Rees, spherical expansion of an emission source at relativistic speeds
yields an apparently superluminal increase in its projected area, which can
explain short-timescale flux density variability without requiring a
relativistic jet oriented near to our line of sight. Therefore, two-epoch radio
flux density variability by itself cannot unambiguously identify sources with
jets directed towards us. Only VLBI imaging can robustly determine the fraction
of broad absorption line quasars which are polar.

field or a function field are the basic objects of study in the arithmetic of

(with complements in \cite{Bhatnagar}) that asserts that a ""polarized"" self-map
of a projective variety is essentially the restriction of a self-map of the
projective space given by the polarization. In this paper we study the natural
self-maps defined the following way: $F$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree
$d$ in $(N+1)$ variables $X_i$ defining a smooth hypersurface. Suppose the
characteristic of the field does not divide $d$ and define the map of partial
derivatives $\phi_F = (F_{X_0},...,F_{X_N})$. The map $\phi_F$ is defined
everywhere due to the following formula of Euler: $\sum X_i F_{X_i} = d F$,
which implies that a point where all the partial derivatives vanish is a
non-smooth point of the hypersuface F=0. One can also compose such a map with
an element of $\PGL_{N+1}$. In the particular case addressed in this article,
N=1, the smoothness condition means that $F$ has only simple zeroes. In this
manner, fixed points and their multipliers are easy to describe and, moreover,
with a few modifications we recover classical dynamical systems like the Newton
method for finding roots of polynomials or the Latt\`es map corresponding to
the multiplication by 2 on an elliptic curve.

uncertainties of the detections. The source detection limit varies across the
survey field but the typical 50% completion limit is ~17th mag (Vega System) in
the 1.90 micron band. A comparison with the expected stellar magnitude
distribution shows that these sources are primarily Main-Sequence massive stars
(>7M) and evolved lower mass stars at the distance of the GC. In particular,
the observed source magnitude distribution exhibits a prominent peak, which
could represent the Red Clump stars within the GC. The observed magnitude and
color of these RC stars support a steep extinction curve in the near-IR toward
the GC. The flux ratios of our detected sources in the two bands also allow for
an adaptive and statistical estimate of extinction across the field. With the
subtraction of the extinction-corrected continuum, we construct a net Pa
emission map and identify a set of Pa-emitting sources, which should mostly be
evolved massive stars with strong stellar winds. The majority of the identified
Pa point sources are located within the three known massive GC stellar
clusters. However, a significant fraction of our Pa-emitting sources are
located outside the clusters and may represent a new class of `field' massive

generation uses a coincidence of 2 or 3 nearest neighbour pixels for producing
an event trigger. The results of this study suggest that a trigger field of
11$\times$11 pixels ($\sim$ $3.4^o$ $\times$ $3.4^o$) is quite optimum for
achieving maximum effective collection area for $\gamma$-rays from a point

found that both 2 or 3 nearest neighbour pixels yield nearly similar results up

$\gamma$-rays. Beyond zenith angle of ~$25^o$, the results suggest that a

simulated integral rates has also been made with corresponding measured values
for validating the predictions of the Monte Carlo simulations, especially the
effective collection area, so that energy spectra of sources (or flux upper
limits in case of no detection) can be determined reliably. Reasonably good
