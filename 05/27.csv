  Decomposition",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new algorithm is presented for computing a canonical rank-R tensor
approximation that has minimal distance to a given tensor in the Frobenius
norm, where the canonical rank-R tensor consists of the sum of R rank-one
components. Each iteration of the method consists of three steps. In the first
step, a tentative new iterate is generated by a stand-alone one-step process,
for which we use alternating least squares (ALS). In the second step, an
accelerated iterate is generated by a nonlinear generalized minimal residual
(GMRES) approach, recombining previous iterates in an optimal way, and
essentially using the stand-alone one-step process as a preconditioner. In
particular, the nonlinear extension of GMRES is used that was proposed by
Washio and Oosterlee in [ETNA Vol. 15 (2003), pp. 165-185] for nonlinear
partial differential equation problems. In the third step, a line search is
performed for globalization. The resulting nonlinear GMRES (N-GMRES)
optimization algorithm is applied to dense and sparse tensor decomposition test
problems. The numerical tests show that ALS accelerated by N-GMRES may
significantly outperform both stand-alone ALS and a standard nonlinear
conjugate gradient optimization method, especially when highly accurate
stationary points are desired for difficult problems. The proposed N-GMRES
optimization algorithm is based on general concepts and may be applied to other
nonlinear optimization problems.

  In this paper we develop PD-MDS, a metric MDS algorithm designed specifically
for the Poincare disk (PD) model of the hyperbolic plane. Emphasizing the
importance of proceeding from first principles in spite of the availability of
various black box optimizers, our construction is based on an elementary

carefully addressed when implementing this as well as more sophisticated
iterative optimization methods in a hyperbolic space model.

phases of matter with topological origins. These phases result in remarkably
robust macroscopic phenomena such as the edge modes in integer quantum Hall
systems, the gapless surface states of topological insulators, and elementary
excitations with non-abelian statistics in fractional quantum Hall systems and
topological superconductors. Many of these states hold promise in the
applications to quantum memories and quantum computation. Artificial quantum
systems, with their precise controllability, provide a versatile platform for
creating and probing a wide variety of topological phases. Here we investigate
topological phenomena in one dimension, using photonic quantum walks. The
photon evolution simulates the dynamics of topological phases which have been
predicted to arise in, for example, polyacetylene. We experimentally confirm
the long-standing prediction of topologically protected localized states
associated with these phases by directly imaging their wavefunctions. Moreover,
we reveal an entirely new topological phenomenon: the existence of a
topologically protected pair of bound states which is unique to periodically
driven systems. Our experiment demonstrates a powerful new approach for
controlling topological properties of quantum systems through periodic driving.

partitions produced by these algorithms. We then examine the largest connected

partitioning strategies that explicitly minimise the number of cliques split.
We further examine several modern overlapping community finding algorithms, in
terms of the interaction between cliques and the communities they find, and in
terms of the global overlap of the sets of communities they find. We conclude
that, due to the connectedness of many networks, any community finding
algorithm that produces partitions must fail to find at least some significant
structures. Moreover, contrary to traditional intuition, in some empirical
networks, strong ties and cliques frequently do cross community boundaries;
much community structure is fundamentally overlapping and unpartitionable in

theoretical and practical importance.
  In this paper we investigate the relation between an operator invertibility
and the rank of its integral kernel to develop a local inverse theory. An
operator is called locally invertible provided that any function can be
recovered from its transformed image if the latter is known in an arbitrary
open subset of its domain, i.e., if its image is known locally. It turns out
that the local invertibility holds for any analytical kernel whose Taylor
functions are linearly independent in any open subset of their domain - the
so-called local linear independence condition.
  We also establish an equivalence between local linear independence and the
so-called full rank a.e. property. The latter can be described as follows: for
any finite, random sample of points, the square matrix obtained by applying,
pairwise, the kernel function on them, has full rank almost surely. As an
illustration, we show that the geodesic distance function on a sphere in more
than one dimensions is of full rank a.e., in contrast to the Euclidean distance
which is not.

ensure that the parties of the communication are authentic. Such task is
accomplished by quantum authentication protocols which are distributed
algorithms based on the intrinsic properties of Quantum Mechanics. The choice
of an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very
delicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in
face of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in
the literature, little is known about them in this perspective, and this lack
of knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to
overcome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to
evaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their
quantum communication complexity. Based on our investigation, no similar
methods to analyze quantum authentication protocols were found in the
literature. Pursuing this further, our approach has advantages that need to be
highlighted: it characterizes a systematic procedure to evaluate quantum
authentication protocols; its evaluation is intuitive, based only on the
protocol execution; the resulting measure is a concise notation of what
resources a quantum authentication protocol demands and how many communications
are performed; it allows comparisons between protocols; it makes possible to
analyze the communication effort when an eavesdropping occurs; and, lastly, it
is likely to be applied in almost any quantum authentication protocol. To
illustrate the proposed approach, we also bring results about its application
in ten existing quantum authentication protocols (data origin authentication
and identity authentication). Such evaluations increase the knowledge about the
existing protocols, presenting its advantages, limitations and contrasts.

superconductivity in many of these strongly correlated metallic systems
originates in the physics of quantum phase transitions, but quite diverse
perspectives have emerged on the fundamentals of the electron-pairing physics,
ranging from Hertz style critical spin fluctuation glue to the holographic
superconductivity of string theory. Here we demonstrate that the gross energy
scaling differences that are behind these various pairing mechanisms are
directly encoded in the frequency and temperature dependence of the dynamical

blue straggler numbers taken from the catalogue of Leigh, Sills & Knigge
(2011). We can summarize our key results as follows: (1) Binary star evolution
consistently dominates blue straggler production in all our best-fitting
models. (2) In order to account for the observed sub-linear dependence of blue
straggler numbers on the core masses (Knigge, Leigh & Sills 2009), the core
binary fraction must be inversely proportional to the total cluster luminosity
and should always exceed at least a few percent. (3) In at least some clusters,
blue straggler formation must be enhanced by dynamical encounters (either via
direct collisions or by stimulating mass-transfer to occur by altering the
distribution of binary orbital parameters) relative to what is expected by
assuming a simple population of binaries evolving in isolation. (4) The
agreement between the predictions of our model and the observations can be
improved by including blue stragglers that form outside the core but later
migrate in due to dynamical friction. (5) Longer blue straggler lifetimes are
preferred in models that include blue stragglers formed outside the core since
this increases the fraction that will have sufficient time to migrate in via
dynamical friction.

where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the main
fueling channel for black hole accretion. We confirm that obscured quasars
mainly reside in massive galaxies (Mstar>10^10 Msun) and that the fraction of
galaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellar
mass. We stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitude
diagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring the
influence that AGN activity can have on such a process. We instead use the
correlation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forming
galaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. We find that at z ~1,
~62% of Type-2 QSOs hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates are
comparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. The fraction of
star-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. We
also find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specific
star-formation rate of the Type-2 QSO hosts is in excellent agreement with that
measured for star-forming galaxies. From the morphological analysis, we
conclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only a
few of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. Finally, bulge-dominated
galaxies tend to host Type-2 QSOs with low Eddington ratios (lambda<0.1), while
disk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers BHs accreting at high

different domains of laser field parameters (frequency nu and field strength
E). A huge quantity of optical photons of the quasiclassical laser field is
necessary to satisfy the conservation laws of energy and momentum of the

photons corresponds to the order of perturbation theory, a vanishingly small
photon production rate results for the optical region and strongly subcritical

photons is small and the production rate of photons from the one-photon
annihilation process becomes accessible to observations for subcritical fields
E <~ E_c. In the infrared region the photon distribution has a 1/k spectrum
typical for flicker noise.

alternative to supersymmetry. We construct their low-energy effective
Lagrangian making only few specific assumptions about the strong sector. These

sources of explicit breaking. In particular we assume that all the explicit
breaking is associated with the couplings of the strong sector to the Standard
Model fields, that is gauge and (proto)-Yukawa interactions. Under those

parameters associated to the top sector. Another crucial property of our
scenarios is the presence of a discrete symmetry, in addition to custodial
SO(4), that controls the $T$-parameter. That can either be simple CP or a $Z_2$
that distinguishes the two Higgs doublets. Among various possibilities we study
in detail models based on SO(6)/SO(4)$\times$ SO(2), focussing on their

two carbon stars with detached shells, U Cam and DR Ser. The polarized light
traces the dust distribution around the stars. From the polarimeter images the
polarized intensity, the polarization degree, and the polarization angle over
the images are calculated. The location and extent of dust structures are
examined in the images. The total dust mass and the dust-to-gas ratios of the
detached shells are also calculated. The images of the circumstellar envelope
of W Aql show what seems to be an elongated structure in the south-west
direction. The detached shells of U Cam and DR Ser are clearly seen in the
images. This is the first time the detached shell around DR Ser has been
imaged. The radii and widths of the shells are determined and found to be 7.9""
and 7.6"", and 0.9"" and 1.2"", for U Cam and DR Ser, respectively. This is
consistent with previous results. The dust masses of the feature south-west of
W Aql, and in the shells of U Cam and DR Ser are also estimated and found to be
1x10^-6, 5x10^-7, and 2x10^-6 Msun, respectively. W Aql is a known binary and
the shape of the circumstellar envelope seems to be in line with what could be
expected from binary interaction on these scales. For the shells, the results
are in agreement with previous investigations. Ages and formation time-scales
are also estimated for the detached shells and found to be consistent with the

shape for the column density probability distribution function (Npdf). Instead,
clouds without star formation seem to possess a lognormal distribution, while
clouds with active star formation develope a power-law tail at high column
densities. The lognormal behavior of the Npdf has been interpreted in terms of
turbulent motions dominating the dynamics of the clouds, while the power-law
behavior occurs when the cloud is dominated by gravity. In the present
contribution we use thermally bi-stable numerical simulations of cloud
formation and evolution to show that, indeed, these two regimes can be
understood in terms of the formation and evolution of molecular clouds: a very
narrow lognormal regime appears when the cloud is being assembled. However, as
the global gravitational contraction occurs, the initial density fluctuations
are enhanced, resulting, first, in a wider lognormal Npdf, and later, in a
power-law Npdf. We thus suggest that the observed Npdf of molecular clouds are
a manifestation of their global gravitationally contracting state. We also show
that, contrary to recent suggestions, the exact value of the power-law slope is
not unique, as it depends on the projection in which the cloud is being
observed.

that hold for strong secrecy metrics and arbitrary channels.
  Specifically, we show that at least for symmetric wiretap channels, random
capacity-based constructions fail to achieve the strong secrecy capacity while
channel-resolvability-based constructions achieve it. We then leverage channel
resolvability to establish the secrecy-capacity region of arbitrary broadcast
channels with confidential messages and a cost constraint for strong secrecy
metrics. Finally, we specialize our results to study the secrecy capacity of
wireless channels with perfect channel state information, mixed channels and
compound channels with receiver Channel State Information (CSI), as well as the
secret-key capacity of source models for secret-key agreement. By tying secrecy
to channel resolvability, we obtain achievable rates for strong secrecy metrics
with simple proofs.

throughout their evolution. We finally demonstrate that the instability strip
of pulsating V777 Her white dwarfs contains no nonvariables, if the hydrogen

of these criteria, constituting a sequence of increasing optimality guarantees.
Two of these are based on deordering plans, which means that ordering relations
may only be removed, not added, while the third one uses reordering, where
arbitrary modifications to the ordering are allowed. It is shown that only the
weakest one of the three criteria is tractable to achieve, the other two being
NP-hard and even difficult to approximate. Similarly, optimising the parallel
execution time of a plan is studied both for deordering and reordering of
plans. In the general case, both of these computations are NP-hard. However, it
is shown that optimal deorderings can be computed in polynomial time for a
class of planning languages based on the notions of producers, consumers and
threats, which includes most of the commonly used planning languages. Computing
optimal reorderings can potentially lead to even faster parallel executions,

logic part defines what the program must do, the control part -- how to do it.
The Logic Programming paradigm was developed with the intention of separating
the logic from the control. Recently, extensive research has been conducted on
automatic generation of control for logic programs. Only a few of these works
considered the issue of automatic generation of control for improving the
efficiency of logic programs. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for
automatic finding of lowest-cost subgoal orderings. The algorithm works using
the divide-and-conquer strategy. The given set of subgoals is partitioned into
smaller sets, based on co-occurrence of free variables. The subsets are ordered
recursively and merged, yielding a provably optimal order. We experimentally
demonstrate the utility of the algorithm by testing it in several domains, and
discuss the possibilities of its cooperation with other existing methods.

been applied to urban and regional analysis for a long time. However, most
allometric analyses were devoted to the single proportional relation between
two elements of a geographical system. Few researches focus on the allometric
scaling of multielements. In this paper, a process of multiscaling allometric
analysis is developed for the studies on spatio-temporal evolution of complex
systems. By means of linear algebra, general system theory, and by analogy with
the analytical hierarchy process, the concepts of allometric growth can be
integrated with the ideas from fractal dimension. Thus a new methodology of
geo-spatial analysis and the related theoretical models emerge. Based on the
least squares regression and matrix operations, a simple algorithm is proposed
to solve the multiscaling allometric equation. Applying the analytical method
of multielement allometry to Chinese cities and regions yields satisfying
results. A conclusion is reached that the multiscaling allometric analysis can
be employed to make a comprehensive evaluation for the relative levels of urban
and regional development, and explain spatial heterogeneity. The notion of
multiscaling allometry may enrich the current theory and methodology of spatial
analyses of urban and regional evolution.

formalisms for the representation of structured knowledge used both in
knowledge representation and in databases. In this paper we study the basic
issues underlying such representation formalisms and single out both their
common characteristics and their distinguishing features. Such investigation
leads us to propose a unifying framework in which we are able to capture the
fundamental aspects of several representation languages used in different
contexts. The proposed formalism is expressed in the style of description
logics, which have been introduced in knowledge representation as a means to
provide a semantically well-founded basis for the structural aspects of
knowledge representation systems. The description logic considered in this
paper is a subset of first order logic with nice computational characteristics.
It is quite expressive and features a novel combination of constructs that has
not been studied before. The distinguishing constructs are number restrictions,
which generalize existence and functional dependencies, inverse roles, which
allow one to refer to the inverse of a relationship, and possibly cyclic
assertions, which are necessary for capturing real world domains. We are able
to show that it is precisely such combination of constructs that makes our
logic powerful enough to model the essential set of features for defining class
structures that are common to frame systems, object-oriented database
languages, and semantic data models. As a consequence of the established
correspondences, several significant extensions of each of the above formalisms
become available. The high expressiveness of the logic we propose and the need
for capturing the reasoning in different contexts forces us to distinguish
between unrestricted and finite model reasoning. A notable feature of our
proposal is that reasoning in both cases is decidable. We argue that, by virtue
of the high expressive power and of the associated reasoning capabilities on
both unrestricted and finite models, our logic provides a common core for
class-based representation formalisms.

spaces: solutions and prioritizations. Successive solutions are only indirectly
related, via the re-prioritization that results from analyzing the prior
solution. Similarly, successive prioritizations are generated by constructing
and analyzing solutions. This `coupled search' has some interesting properties,

reasoning for a family of formalisms known as Description Logics. The approach
is based on the notion of adding new concept constructors, and includes a
heuristic methodology for specifying the desired extensions, as well as a
modularized software architecture that supports implementing extensions. The
architecture detailed here falls in the normalize-compared paradigm, and
supports both intentional reasoning (subsumption) involving concepts, and
extensional reasoning involving individuals after incremental updates to the
knowledge base. The resulting approach can be used to extend the reasoner with
specialized notions that are motivated by specific problems or application
areas, such as reasoning about dates, plans, etc. In addition, it provides an
opportunity to implement constructors that are not currently yet sufficiently
well understood theoretically, but are needed in practice. Also, for
constructors that are provably hard to reason with (e.g., ones whose presence
would lead to undecidability), it allows the implementation of incomplete
reasoners where the incompleteness is tailored to be acceptable for the
application at hand.

of thermal and electric currents greatly reduces switching errors, and
simultaneously reduces the electric switching current density by more than an

numerically. As compared to STT-MRAM with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy,
magnonic STT-MRAM reduces the overall switching energy by almost 80%.

improved tunnel barrier reliability. The combination of lower power, improved
reliability, higher integration density, and larger read margin make magnonic
STT-MRAM a promising choice for future non-volatile storage.

outflows through newly performed two-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic
simulations. By starting from a torus threaded with weak toroidal magnetic
fields and by controlling the central density of the initial torus, rho_0, we
can reproduce three distinct modes of accretion flow. In model A with the
highest central density, an optically and geometrically thick supercritical
accretion disk is created. The radiation force greatly exceeds the gravity
above the disk surface, thereby driving a strong outflow (or jet). Because of
the mild beaming, the apparent (isotropic) photon luminosity is ~22L_E (where
L_E is the Eddington luminosity) in the face-on view. Even higher apparent
luminosity is feasible if we increase the flow density. In model B with a
moderate density, radiative cooling of the accretion flow is so efficient that
a standard-type, cold, and geometrically thin disk is formed at radii greater
than ~7R_S (where R_S is the Schwarzschild radius), while the flow is
radiatively inefficient otherwise. The magnetic-pressure-driven disk wind
appears in this model. In model C the density is too low for the flow to be
radiatively efficient. The flow thus becomes radiatively inefficient accretion
flow, which is geometrically thick and optically thin. The magnetic-pressure
force, in cooperation with the gas-pressure force, drives outflows from the
disk surface, and the flow releases its energy via jets rather than via
radiation. Observational implications are briefly discussed.

the capacity of the interference channel for high signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). Most prior work on IA is based on the impractical assumption that
perfect and global channel-state information(CSI) is available at all
transmitters. To implement IA, each receiver has to feed back CSI to all
interferers, resulting in overwhelming feedback overhead. In particular, the
sum feedback rate of each receiver scales quadratically with the number of
users even if the quantized CSI is fed back. To substantially suppress feedback
overhead, this paper focuses on designing efficient arrangements of feedback
links, called feedback topologies, under the IA constraint. For the
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) K-user interference channel, we propose
the feedback topology that supports sequential CSI exchange (feedback and
feedforward) between transmitters and receivers so as to achieve IA
progressively. This feedback topology is shown to reduce the network feedback
overhead from a cubic function of K to a linear one. To reduce the delay in the
sequential CSI exchange, an alternative feedback topology is designed for
supporting two-hop feedback via a control station, which also achieves the
linear feedback scaling with K. Next, given the proposed feedback topologies,
the feedback-bit allocation algorithm is designed for allocating feedback bits
by each receiver to different feedback links so as to regulate the residual
interference caused by the finite-rate feedback. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed bit allocation leads to significant throughput gains
especially in strong interference environments.

flash of a helium accreting neutron star in a binary system have been
investigated. Since the ignition points determine the properties of a
thermonuclear flash of type I X-ray bursts, we examine the cases of different
accretion rates, $dM/dt (\dot{M})$, of helium from $3\times10^{-10} M_{\odot}
\rm yr^{-1}$ to $3\times10^{-8} M_{\odot} \rm yr^{-1}$, which could cover the
observed accretion rates. We find that for the cases of low accretion rates,
nuclear burnings are ignited at the helium layers of rather low densities. As a
consequence, helium deflagration would be triggered for all cases of lower
accretion rate than $\dot{M}\simeq 3\times10^{-8} M_{\odot} \rm yr^{-1}$. We
find that OKK rate could be barely consistent with the available observations
of the X-ray bursts on the helium accreting neutron star. However this
coincidence is found to depend on the properties of crustal heating and the
neutron star model.We suggest that OKK rate would be reduced by a factor of
$10^{2-3}$ for $10^8$ K in the range of the observational errors.

typically collect a relatively small fraction of nodes and their associated
edges. Past work in this area has primarily focused on obtaining a
representative sample of nodes and on efficient estimation of local graph
properties (such as node degree distribution or any node attribute) based on
that sample. However, less is known about estimating the global topology of the
underlying graph.
  In this paper, we show how to efficiently estimate the coarse-grained
topology of a graph from a probability sample of nodes. In particular, we
consider that nodes are partitioned into categories (e.g., countries or
work/study places in OSNs), which naturally defines a weighted category graph.
We are interested in estimating (i) the size of categories and (ii) the
probability that nodes from two different categories are connected. For each of
the above, we develop a family of estimators for design-based inference under
uniform or non-uniform sampling, employing either of two measurement
strategies: induced subgraph sampling, which relies only on information about
the sampled nodes; and star sampling, which also exploits category information
about the neighbors of sampled nodes. We prove consistency of these estimators
and evaluate their efficiency via simulation on fully known graphs. We also
apply our methodology to a sample of Facebook users to obtain a number of
category graphs, such as the college friendship graph and the country
friendship graph; we share and visualize the resulting data at

Current research is addressing this issue by investigating three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamic models that extend from the photosphere to the corona. By
studying the average properties of emission line profiles synthesized from the
simulation runs and comparing them to observations with present-day
instrumentation, we investigate the origin of mass flows in the solar
transition region and corona. Doppler shifts were determined from the emission
line profiles of various extreme-ultraviolet emission lines formed in the range
of $T=10^4-10^6$ K. Plasma velocities and mass flows were investigated for
their contribution to the observed Doppler shifts in the model. In particular,
the temporal evolution of plasma flows along the magnetic field lines was
analyzed. Comparing observed vs. modeled Doppler shifts shows a good
correlation in the temperature range $\log(T$/[K])=4.5-5.7, which is the basis
of our search for the origin of the line shifts. The vertical velocity obtained
when weighting the velocity by the density squared is shown to be almost
identical to the corresponding Doppler shift. Therefore, a direct comparison
between Doppler shifts and the model parameters is allowed. A simple
interpretation of Doppler shifts in terms of mass flux leads to overestimating
the mass flux. Upflows in the model appear in the form of cool pockets of gas
that heat up slowly as they rise. Their low temperature means that these
pockets are not observed as blueshifts in the transition region and coronal
lines. For a set of magnetic field lines, two different flow phases could be
identified. The coronal part of the field line is intermittently connected to
subjacent layers of either strong or weak heating, leading either to mass flows
into the loop or to the draining of the loop.

by a time-like thin shell in the nontrivial case in which the inner region of

We will then show that, while the evolution is determined by a large set of
constraints, an analytical description for the evolution of the bubble radius
can be obtained by formally expanding for short times after the shell attains
its minimum size. In particular, we will find that a bubble of radiation,
starting out with vanishing expansion speed, can be matched with an expanding
dust exterior, but not with a collapsing dust exterior, regardless of the dust
energy density. The former case can then be used to describe the nucleation of
a bubble of radiation inside an expanding dust cloud, although the final
configuration contains more energy than the initial dust, and the reverse
process, with collapsing radiation transforming into collapsing dust, is
therefore energetically favored. We however speculate a (small) decaying vacuum
energy or cosmological constant inside dust could still trigger nucleation.
Finally, our perturbative (yet analytical) approach can be easily adapted to
different combinations of matter inside and outside the shell, as well as to
more general surface density, of relevance for cosmology and studies of defect

studied in detail, where the renormalization of the Lorentz force leads to a
system of non-linear differential equations for 3 Lorentz scalars. The system
is then solved numerically, where it is shown that the mass-shell deviation
scalar $\ve$ either smoothly falls down to 0 (this result provides a mechanism
for the mass stability of the off-shell theory), or strongly diverges under
more extreme conditions. In both cases, no runaway motion is observed.
Stability analysis indicates that the system seems to have chaotic behavior in
the divergent case. It is also shown that, although a motion under which the
mass-shell deviation $\ve$ is constant but not-zero, is indeed possible, but,
it is unstable, and eventually it either decays to 0 or diverges.

measurement of the charge variation on the island using a nearby charge
detector. Finally, the charge feedback signal clearly evidences loading into
excited states of the dynamic quantum dot during single-electron pump

state and the Extreme Island state spectra are best described by a two
component model consisting of a soft multi-colour blackbody emission likely
originating from the accretion disk and a harder Comptonized emission from the
boundary layer. Evidence for a hard tail (extending to ~50 keV) is found during
the Banana state; this further (transient) component, accounting for atleast
~1.5% of the source luminosity, is modeled by a power-law. Aql X-1 is the
second Atoll source after GX 13+1 to show a high energy tail. The presence of a
weak but broad Fe line provides further support for a standard accretion disk
extending nearly to the neutron star surface. The input photons for the
Comptonizing boundary layer could either be the disk photons or the hidden
surface of the star or both. The luminosity of the boundary layer is similar to
the disk luminosity in the banana state and is about six times larger in the

quasiparticle corrections of more than 1.0 eV to the Kohn-Sham band gaps from

self-energy corrections transform the SiC sheet from a indirect LDA band gap to
a direct band gap material. Furthermore, the quasiparticle band gaps of SiC-NTs
with different chiralities behave very differently as a function of tube
diameter, and this can be attributed to the difference in the curvature-induced
orbital rehybridization between the different chiral nanotubes. The calculated
optical absorption spectra are dominated by discrete exciton peaks due to
exciton states with large binding energy up to 2.0 eV in the SiC sheet and
SiC-NTs. The formation of strongly bound excitons is attributed to the enhanced
electron-hole interaction in these low dimensional systems. Remarkably, the
excited electron amplitude of the exciton wavefunction is found to peak on the
Si atoms near the hole position (which is on the C site) in the zigzag SiC-NTs,
indicating a charge transfer from an anion (hole) to its neighboring cations by
photoexcitation. In contrast, this pronounced peak structure disappear in the

anisotropy during growth. Overall kinetics and shape selection features of step
meandering are analyzed assuming their dependence on the external particle flux
and on the temperature. It appears that at relatively high temperatures and low
fluxes steps move regularly preserving their initial shapes of straight,
parallel lines. For higher fluxes and at wide range of temperatures step
meandering happens. It is shown that, depending on the initial surface
parameters, two different scenarios of step meandering are realized. In both
these regimes meandering has different character as a function of time. For
relatively high fluxes meanders have wavelengths shorter than the terrace width
and they grow independently. Eventually surface ends up as a rough structure.
When flux is lower regular pattern of meanders emerges. Step meander even if
Schwoebel barrier is absent. Too high barrier destroys step stability. The
amplitude of wavelike step meanders increases in time up to a saturation value.
The mechanism of such meander development is elucidated.

to freely vary the light polarization of a free-electron laser, when the latter
is operated in the so-called nonlinear harmonic-generation regime. In such

fundamental emission, gaining access to the shortest possible wavelengths the
device can generate. In this letter we provide the first experimental
characterization of the polarization of the harmonic light produced by a

metal-poor group includes about a third of the total. It shows a moderate O-Na
anticorrelation, and similarly to other clusters, the O-poor second generation
stars are more centrally concentrated than the O-rich first generation ones.
This whole population is La-poor, with a pattern of abundances for n-capture
elements which is very close to a scaled r-process one. The metal-intermediate
group includes the majority of the cluster stars. This is a much more complex
population, with an internal spread in the abundances of most elements. It
shows an extreme O-Na anticorrelation, with a very numerous population of
extremely O-poor and He-rich second generation stars. This second generation is
very centrally concentrated. This whole population is La-rich, with a pattern
of the abundances of n-capture elements that shows a strong contribution by the
s-process. The spread in metallicity within this metal-intermediate population
is not very large, and we might attribute it either to non uniformities of an
originally very extended star forming region, or to some ability to retain a
fraction of the ejecta of the core collapse SNe that exploded first, or both.
As previously noticed, the metal-rich group has an Na-O correlation, rather
than anticorrelation. There is evidence for the contribution of both massive
stars ending their life as core-collapse SNe, and intermediate/low mass stars,
producing the s-capture elements. Kinematics of this population suggests that
it formed within the cluster rather than being accreted.

allowing a steady state present a dual scenario, where either the hub

presented. The modifications of the classical DLA model are in the attachment
to the cluster rules and in the scheme of particle generation/killing. In the
classical DLA model if a particle reaches the growing cluster it sticks to it
immediately and irreversibly and then the next particle is released. We will
abandon this original prerequisite, and by changing the sticking probability to
the cluster we will change the diffusion regime towards more kinetic one. For a
growing cluster consisting of only one type of particles this variation in the
sticking probability is (more or less) a rude violation of the hypothesis for
diffusion limitation in the DLA model. Since in a lot of experiments different
types of particles are used with different sticking probabilities (e.g.
different regimes of attachment), we develop a modified DLA model with two
types of particles. The second modification we introduce at that point is a
scheme for particle generation/killing we call ""second chance"" - when a
particle is killed after reaching a given limiting distance from the cluster,
it is killed and then returned to the point it was originally generated. Thus
the model is capable to produce a great variety of growing patterns (fractals,
spirals) by changing only a single parameter and we are able to construct a
morphological diagram of our generalized DLA model with two different types of
particles.

under the assumption of LTE is presented. Unlike flux-limited diffusion the
method is polychromatic, includes scattering, and is able to treat the
optically thick and free-streaming regimes simultaneously. The algorithm is
tested on a variety of 1-d and 2-d problems, and good agreement with benchmark
solutions is found. The method is used to calculate the time-varying spectral
energy distribution from a circumstellar disc illuminated by a protostar whose
accretion luminosity is varying. It is shown that the time lag between the
optical variability and the infrared variability results from a combination of
the photon travel time and the thermal response in the disc, and that the lag
is an approximately linear function of wavelength.

slow wind solution in fast rotating massive stars, we explore numerically the
parameter space of radiation-driven flows to search for new wind solutions in
slowly rotating stars, that could explain the origin of these discrepancies. We
solve the 1-D hydrodynamical equation of rotating radiation-driven winds at
different stellar latitudes and explore the influence of ionization's changes
throughout the wind in the velocity profile. We have found that for particular
sets of stellar and line-force parameters, a new slow solution exists over the
entire star when the rotational speed is slow or even zero. In the case of slow
rotating A-type supergiant stars the presence of this novel slow solution at
all latitudes leads to mass losses and wind terminal velocities which are in
agreement with the observed values. The theoretical Wind Momentum-Luminosity
Relationship derived with these slow solutions shows very good agreement with

important dynamical processes, including chemical reactions, epidemic
outbreaks, and biological evolution. Despite their fundamental role in complex
systems, traveling waves remain elusive because they are often dominated by
rare fluctuations in the wave tip, which have defied any rigorous analysis so
far. Here, we show that by adjusting nonlinear model details, noisy traveling
waves can be solved exactly. The moment equations of these tuned models are
closed and have a simple analytical structure resembling the deterministic
approximation supplemented by a nonlocal cutoff term. The peculiar form of the
cutoff shapes the noisy edge of traveling waves and is critical for the correct
prediction of the wave speed and its fluctuations. Our approach is illustrated
and benchmarked using the example of fitness waves arising in simple models of
microbial evolution, which are highly sensitive to number fluctuations. We
demonstrate explicitly how these models can be tuned to account for finite
population sizes and determine how quickly populations adapt as a function of
population size and mutation rates. More generally, our method is shown to
apply to a broad class of models, in which number fluctuations are generated by
branching processes. Because of this versatility, the method of model tuning
may serve as a promising route toward unraveling universal properties of
complex discrete particle systems.

we present a series of idealized 3D compressible magnetoconvection experiments
that differ from previous such experiments in several details, bringing them
closer to realistic solar conditions. An initially vertical magnetic field B 0
is imposed on a time snapshot of fully developed solar-like turbulent
convection in a layer bounded by a stable layer from above. Upon relaxation to
a statistically steady state, the structure of the flow field and magnetic
field is examined. Instead of the vigorous granular convection (GRC) well known
to take place in magnetized or weakly magnetized convection, for high values of
B0 heat is transported by small-scale convection (SSC) in the form of narrow,
persistent convective columns consisting of slender upflows accompanied by
adjacent downflow patches, which are reminiscent of the 'convectons' identified
in earlier semianalytic models. For moderate field strengths, flux separation
(FXS) is observed: isolated field-free inclusions of GRC are embedded in a
strongly magnetized plasma with SSC. Between the SSC and FXS regimes, a
transitional regime (F/S) is identified where convectons dynamically evolve
into multiply segmented granular inclusions and back. Our results agree in some
aspects more closely with observed umbral structures than earlier idealized
models, because they do reproduce the strong localized, patchy downflows
immediately adjacent to the narrow convective columns. Based on recent
observations of umbral dots, we suggest that in some cases the conditions in
sunspot umbrae correspond to the newly identified F/S transitional regime.

  Intelligence and Statistics April 11-13, 2011 Ft. Lauderdale, FL, USA",,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a nonparametric generalization of belief propagation, Kernel
Belief Propagation (KBP), for pairwise Markov random fields. Messages are
represented as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and
message updates are simple linear operations in the RKHS. KBP makes none of the
assumptions commonly required in classical BP algorithms: the variables need
not arise from a finite domain or a Gaussian distribution, nor must their
relations take any particular parametric form. Rather, the relations between
variables are represented implicitly, and are learned nonparametrically from
training data. KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where
kernels are defined (Rd, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric
models are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not
exist. The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial in the
training data size. We also propose a constant time approximate message update
procedure by representing messages using a small number of basis functions. In
experiments, we apply KBP to image denoising, depth prediction from still
images, and protein configuration prediction: KBP is faster than competing
classical and nonparametric approaches (by orders of magnitude, in some cases),
while providing significantly more accurate results.

Service (QoS) in MANET. However, limited battery power, other resource
constraints and mobility of nodes make QoS provisioning difficult to achieve in
MANET. This difficulty can be overcome by using a cross-layer approach for
routing. In [1] Patil et al., proposed a cross-layer routing protocol named
Cost Based Power Aware Cross Layer - AODV (CPACL-AODV) which overcomes the
limitation of battery power of nodes. Though many similar energy efficient and
cross-layer routing protocols have been proposed for MANET, none of them
handles QoS. A novel MANET routing protocol, Type of Service, Power and
Bandwidth Aware AODV (TSPBA-AODV), which overcomes resource constraints and
simultaneously provides QoS guarantees using a cross-layer approach, is
proposed in this paper. In addition the effect of variation in nodes' mobility
on performance of TSPBA-AODV is compared with that of CPACL-AODV [1] for two
different types of network traffic. As shown by the results of simulations
performed, TSPBA-AODV performs better than CPACL-AODV for MANET in which nodes
move with small speeds (speeds up to 40 Km/hr approx.). In addition the effect
of variation in data sending rate of nodes on performance of the protocols is
also studied. As shown by the results of simulations performed, TSPBA-AODV
performs better than CPACL-AODV for all variations in data sending rate of
nodes.

Jaynes, originator of the maximum entropy interpretation of statistical
mechanics, emphasized that there is an inevitable trade-off between the
conflicting requirements of robustness and accuracy for any inferencing
algorithm. This is because robustness requires discarding of information in
order to reduce the sensitivity to outliers. The principal of nonlinear
statistical coupling, which is an interpretation of the Tsallis entropy
generalization, can be used to quantify this trade-off. The coupled-surprisal,
-ln_k (p)=-(p^k-1)/k, is a generalization of Shannon surprisal or the
logarithmic scoring rule, given a forecast p of a true event by an inferencing
algorithm. The coupling parameter k=1-q, where q is the Tsallis entropy index,
is the degree of nonlinear coupling between statistical states. Positive
(negative) values of nonlinear coupling decrease (increase) the surprisal
information metric and thereby biases the risk in favor of decisive (robust)
algorithms relative to the Shannon surprisal (k=0). We show that translating
the average coupled-surprisal to an effective probability is equivalent to
using the generalized mean of the true event probabilities as a scoring rule.
The metric is used to assess the robustness, accuracy, and decisiveness of a
fusion algorithm. We use a two-parameter fusion algorithm to combine input
probabilities from N sources. The generalized mean parameter 'alpha' varies the
degree of smoothing and raising to a power N^beta with beta between 0 and 1
provides a model of correlation.

constrain dark energy. To capitalise on this potential it is necessary to
measure galaxy shapes with great accuracy, which in turn requires a detailed
model for the image blurring, the Point Spread Function (PSF). In general the
PSF varies with wavelength and therefore the PSF integrated over an observing
filter depends on the spectrum of the object. For a typical galaxy the spectrum
varies across the galaxy image, thus the PSF depends on the position within the
image. We estimate the bias on the shear due to such colour gradients by
modelling galaxies using two co-centered, co-elliptical Sersic profiles, each
with a different spectrum. We estimate the effect of ignoring colour gradients
and find the shear bias from a single galaxy can be very large depending on the
properties of the galaxy. We find that halving the filter width reduces the
shear bias by a factor of about 5. We show that, to first order, tomographic
cosmic shear two point statistics depend on the mean shear bias over the galaxy
population at a given redshift. For a single broad filter, and averaging over a
small galaxy catalogue, we find a mean shear bias which is subdominant to the
predicted statistical errors for future cosmic shear surveys. However, the true
mean shear bias may exceed the statistical errors, depending on how accurately
the catalogue represents the observed distribution of galaxies in the cosmic
shear survey. We then investigate the bias on the shear for two-filter imaging
and find that the bias is reduced by at least an order of magnitude. Lastly, we
find that it is possible to calibrate galaxies for which colour gradients were
ignored using two-filter imaging of a fair sample of noisy galaxies, if the
galaxy model is known. For a S/N of 25 the number of galaxies required in each
tomographic redshift bin is of order 1e4.

participants in a distribution network. Traditional client-server based video
streaming solutions sustain precious bandwidth provision rate on the server.
Recently, several P2P streaming systems have been organized to provide
on-demand and live video streaming services on the wireless network at reduced
server cost. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing is a new pattern to construct
disseminated network applications. Typical error control techniques are not
very well matched and on the other hand error prone channels has increased
greatly for video transmission e.g., over wireless networks and IP. These two
facts united together provided the essential motivation for the development of
a new set of techniques (error concealment) capable of dealing with
transmission errors in video systems. In this paper, we propose an flexible
multiple description coding method named as Flexible Spatial-Temporal (FST)
which improves error resilience in the sense of frame loss possibilities over
independent paths. It introduces combination of both spatial and temporal
concealment technique at the receiver and to conceal the lost frames more
effectively. Experimental results show that, proposed approach attains
reasonable quality of video performance over P2P wireless network.
