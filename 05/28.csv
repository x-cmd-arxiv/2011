to temperature, which may lead to non-monotonic temperature dependence of the

conditions the biexcitonic interband polarization can be coherently transferred
to the excitonic one, leading to an extended life time of the total coherent

fundamental problem in turbulent combustion theory. Several models have been
proposed to study the turbulent flame speed, such as the G-equations, the
F-equations (Majda-Souganidis model) and reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA)
equations. In the first part of this paper, we show that flow induced strain
reduces front speeds of G-equations in periodic compressible and shear flows.
The F-equations arise in asymptotic analysis of reaction-diffusion-advection
equations and are quadratically nonlinear analogues of the G-equations. In the
second part of the paper, we compare asymptotic growth rates of the turbulent
flame speeds from the G-equations, the F-equations and the RDA equations in the
large amplitude ($A$) regime of spatially periodic flows. The F and G equations
share the same asymptotic front speed growth rate; in particular, the same
sublinear growth law $A\over \log(A)$ holds in cellular flows. Moreover, in two
space dimensions, if one of these three models (G-equation, F-equation and the
RDA equation) predicts the bending effect (sublinear growth in the large flow),
so will the other two. The nonoccurrence of speed bending is characterized by
the existence of periodic orbits on the torus and the property of their
rotation vectors in the advective flow fields. The cat's eye flow is discussed
as a typical example of directional dependence of the front speed bending. The
large time front speeds of the viscous F-equation have the same growth rate as
those of the inviscid F and G-equations in two dimensional periodic
incompressible flows.

opacity contributed by Thomson scattering and thermal bremsstrahlung. Our
analysis is concentrated on a detailed numerical investigation of hot
two-dimensional, Bondi-Hoyle accretion flows with various Mach numbers. We find
significant differences with respect to purely hydrodynamical evolutions. In
particular, once the system relaxes to a radiation-pressure dominated regime,
the accretion rates become about two orders of magnitude smaller than in the
purely hydrodynamical case, remaining however super-Eddington as are the
luminosities. Furthermore, when increasing the Mach number of the inflowing
gas, the accretion rates become smaller because of the smaller cross section of
the black hole, but the luminosities increase as a result a stronger emission
in the shocked regions. Overall, our approach provides the first
self-consistent calculation of the Bondi-Hoyle luminosity, most of which is
emitted within r~100 M from the black hole, with typical values L/L_Edd ~ 1-7,
and corresponding energy efficiencies eta_BH ~ 0.09-0.5. The possibility of
computing luminosities self-consistently has also allowed us to compare with
the bremsstrahlung luminosity often used in modelling the electromagnetic
counterparts to supermassive black-hole binaries, to find that in the
optically-thick regime these more crude estimates are about 20 times larger

to an observer at infinity. But we argue that the {\it accessible} information

information carrying signals from a system that has fallen too close to the
horizon. Extremal holes have T=0, but there is a minimum energy required to
emit a quantum in the short proper time left before the horizon is crossed. If
we attempt to bring the system back to infinity for observation, then
acceleration radiation destroys the information. All three considerations give
a critical distance from the horizon $d\sim \sqrt{r_H\over \Delta E}$, where
$r_H$ is the horizon radius and $\Delta E$ is the energy scale characterizing
the system. For systems in string theory where we pack information as densely
as possible, this acceleration constraint is found to have a geometric
interpretation. These estimates suggest that in theories of gravity we should
measure information not as a quantity contained inside a given system, but in
terms of how much of that information can be reliably accessed by another

approach similar in spirit to the equilibrium theory given by Gibbs. Requiring
Hamilton's principle of stationary action to be satisfied on average during a
trajectory, we add constraints on the transition probability distribution which
lead to a path probability of the Onsager-Machlup form. Additional constraints
derived from energy and momentum conservation laws then introduce heat exchange
and external driving forces into the system, with Lagrange multipliers related
to the temperature and pressure of an external thermostatic system. The result
is a fully time-dependent, non-local description of a nonequilibrium ensemble.
Detailed accounting of the energy exchange and the change in information
entropy of the central system then provides a description of the entropy
production which is not dependent on the specification or existence of a
steady-state or on any definition of thermostatic variables for the central
system. These results are connected to the literature by showing a method for
path re-weighting, creation of arbitrary fluctuation theorems, and by providing
a simple derivation of Jarzynski relations referencing a steady-state. In
addition, we identify path free energy and entropy (caliber) functionals which
generate a first law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by relating changes in
the driving forces to changes in path averages. Analogous to the Gibbs
relations, the variations in the path averages yield fluctuation-dissipation
theorems. The thermodynamic entropy production can also be stated in terms of
the caliber functional, resulting in a simple proof of our microscopic form for
the Clausius statement. We find that the maximum entropy route provides a clear
derivation of the path free energy functional, path-integral, Langevin,
Brownian, and Fokker-Planck statements of nonequilibrium processes.

supremum being taken over intervals of length not exceeding $2\pi$. It contains
the periodic functions integrable in the sense of Lebesgue and

$|n|\to\infty$. The convolution is defined for $f\in\alext$ and $g$ a periodic
function of bounded variation. The convolution commutes with translations and
is commutative and associative. There is the estimate $\|f\ast g\|_\infty\leq
\|f\|_\T \|g\|_\bv$. For $g\in L^1(\T)$, $\|f\ast g\|_\T\leq \|f\|_\T \|g\|_1$.

to derive a master equation for the propagation of monochromatic

analize its solutions in the high frequency approximation using the `standard'

results of the geometrical optics at short distances. However, it modifies the
asymptotic behavior of the circularly polarized beams in the late-time regime.
We demonstrate that the corresponding equations for the circularly polarized
beam can be effectively obtained by modification of the background geometry by
including a small factor proportional to $\omega^{-1}$ whose sign corresponds
to photon helicity. We obtain the modified equations for circularly polarized
rays by using such a `renormalization' procedure, and calculate the

flat dwarf galaxies, both rotating and non-rotating. The main goal is to
investigate possible mechanisms to explain the observed dichotomy in radial
stellar metallicity profiles of dwarf galaxies: dwarf irregulars (dIrr) and
flat, rotating dwarf ellipticals (dE) generally possess flat metallicity
profiles, while rounder and non-rotating dEs show strong negative metallicity
gradients. These simulations show that flattening by rotation is key to
reproducing the observed characteristics of flat dwarf galaxies, proving
particularly efficient in erasing metallicity gradients. We propose a
""centrifugal barrier mechanism"" as an alternative to the previously suggested
""fountain mechanism"" for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and
flat, rotating dEs. While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little
influence, the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas, so
that star formation (SF) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally
concentrated, occurring galaxy-wide. Additionally, this leads to more
continuous SFHs by preventing large-scale oscillations in the SFR
(""breathing""), and creates low density holes in the ISM, in agreement with
observations of dIrrs. Our general conclusion is that rotation has a
significant influence on the evolution and appearance of dwarf galaxies, and we
suggest angular momentum as a second parameter (after galaxy mass as the
dominant parameter) in dwarf galaxy evolution. Angular momentum differentiates
between SF modes, making our fast rotating models qualitatively resemble dIrrs,
which does not seem possible without rotation.

without feedback are developed when the source is highly intermittent. In the
system model of interest, the codeword is transmitted at a random time within a
prescribed window whose length corresponds to the level of asynchronism between
the transmitter and the receiver. The decoder operates sequentially and
communication rate is defined as the ratio between the message size and the
elapsed time between when transmission commences and when the decoder makes a
decision.
  For such systems, general upper and lower bounds on capacity as a function of
the level of asynchronism are established, and are shown to coincide in some
nontrivial cases. From these bounds, several properties of this asynchronous
capacity are derived. In addition, the performance of training-based schemes is
investigated. It is shown that such schemes, which implement synchronization
and information transmission on separate degrees of freedom in the encoding,
cannot achieve the asynchronous capacity in general, and that the penalty is
particularly significant in the high-rate regime.

combined with clustering measurements to select samples of galaxies at
different redshifts likely to follow a progenitor-to-descendant relationship.
As the method uses clustering information, we refer to galaxy samples selected
this way as clustering-selected samples. We apply this method to infer the
number of mergers during the evolution of MUSYC early-type galaxies (ETGs) from
z~1 to the present-day. Methods: The method consists in using clustering
information to infer the typical dark-matter halo mass of the hosts of the
selected progenitor galaxies. Using LambdaCDM predictions, it is then possible
to follow these haloes to a later time where the sample of descendants will be
that with the clustering of these descendant haloes. Results: This technique
shows that ETGs at a given redshift evolve into brighter galaxies at lower
redshifts (considering rest-frame, passively evolved optical luminosities).
This indicates that the stellar mass of these galaxies increases with time and
that, in principle, a stellar mass selection at different redshifts does not
provide samples of galaxies in a progenitor-descendant relationship.
Conclusions: The comparison between high redshift ETGs and their likely
descendants at z=0 points to a higher number density for the progenitors by a
factor 5.5+-4.0, implying the need for mergers to decrease their number density
by today. Because the luminosity densities of progenitors and descendants are
consistent, our results show no need for significant star-formation in ETGs
since z=1, which indicates that the needed mergers are dry, i.e. gas free.

unobserved zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). The peak is much more pronounced
and easily observed using electromigration-induced break junction (BJ) contacts
rather than macroscopic 4-probe electrodes. We attribute this ZBCP to quantum
correlations amongst electrons, in view of other temperature- ($\it{T}$-) and
magnetic ($\it{B}$-) dependent measurements as well as predictions of the
Hubbard model and dynamic mean field theory in this transition regime. Metallic
film resistances ($\it{R}$'s) increase linearly with $\it{T}$, but with
suggested scattering lengths that, anomalously, are shorter than inter-atomic
distances. Similar so-called ""bad-metallic"" behaviour has been observed in
several studies of correlated systems, and is still being understood. We find
here that the anomalous $\it{R}$ behaviours are associated with the ZBCP. This
system can serve as a new test bed for studying correlated electrons and points
to a nano building-block strategy for fashioning novel correlated materials.

Lyman-alpha radiation backgrounds at high redshift. At these early epochs the
backgrounds are symptoms of a universe newly lit with its first stars. LW
photons (11.5-13.6 eV) are of particular interest because they dissociate
molecular hydrogen, the primary coolant in the first minihalos. By using a
variation of the halo model, we efficiently generate power spectra for any
choice of radiation background. We find that the LW power spectrum typically
traces the matter power spectrum at large scales but turns over at the scale
corresponding to the effective `horizon' of LW photons (~100 comoving Mpc),
unless the sources are extremely rare. The series of horizons that characterize
the Lyman-alpha flux profile shape the fluctuations of that background in a
similar fashion, though those imprints are washed out once one considers
fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the 21-cm signal. The Lyman-alpha
background strongly affects the redshifted 21-cm signal at just about the time
the LW background begins to dissociate molecular hydrogen, so measuring that
background's properties will reveal important information about the transition
from early Population III stars to more normal stars. Around this time we find
that fluctuations in the LW background are weak; the fractional standard
deviation is less than ~0.5 on scales > 10 cMpc, only rising to be of order
unity on scales < 1 cMpc. This should not lead to substantial spatial
fluctuations in molecular hydrogen content, except at the earliest times. Even
then, most halos form far from other sources, so the transition from star
formation in low-mass to high-mass halos is rather homogeneous across the
universe.

mergers - and on the age of the last substantial accretion event. We use this
to constrain the mass assembly history of two apparently relaxed nearby
Early-Type Galaxies (ETGs) selected from the Atlas-3D sample, NGC 680 and NGC
5557. Our ultra deep optical images obtained with MegaCam on the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope reach 29 mag/arcsec^2 in the g-band. They reveal
very low-surface brightness (LSB) filamentary structures around these
ellipticals. Among them, a gigantic 160 kpc long tail East of NGC 5557 hosts
gas-rich star-forming objects. NGC 680 exhibits two major diffuse plumes
apparently connected to extended HI tails, as well as a series of arcs and
shells. Comparing the outer stellar and gaseous morphology of the two
ellipticals with that predicted from models of colliding galaxies, we argue
that the LSB features are tidal debris, the star-forming objects near NGC 5557,
long lived Tidal Dwarf Galaxies and that each of the two ETGs was assembled
during a relatively recent, major wet merger, which likely occurred at a
redshift below z = 0.5. The inner kinematics of NGC 680 is typical for fast
rotators which make the bulk of nearby ETGs in the Atlas-3D sample. NGC 5557
belongs to the poorly populated class of massive, round, slow rotators that are
predicted by semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to be the
end-product of a complex mass accretion history, involving ancient major
mergers and more recent minor mergers. Our observations suggest that under
specific circumstances a single binary merger may dominate the formation
history of such objects and thus that at least some massive ETGs may form at
relatively low redshift (abridged).

multiplication in semiconductor quantum dots is presented. We investigate the
underlying dynamics in the electronic subband occupations and the time-resolved
optical emission spectrum, focusing on the interplay between the light-matter
and the Coulomb interaction. We find a transition between qualitatively
differing behaviors of carrier multiplication, which is controlled by the ratio
of the interaction induced time scale and the pulse duration of the exciting
light pulse. On short time scales, i.e., before intra-band relaxation, this
opens the possibility of detecting carrier multiplication without refering to
measurements of (multi-)exciton lifetimes.

equilibrium theory could have been derived simply from a description of the
available problem information. In addition, our presentation leads to novel
insights into questions associated with symmetry and non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics. Two surprising consequences to be explored in further
work are that (in)distinguishability factors are automatically predicted from
the problem formulation and that a quantity related to the thermodynamic
entropy production is found by considering information loss in non-equilibrium
processes. Using the problem of ion channel thermodynamics as an example, we
illustrate the idea of building up complexity by successively adding
information to create progressively more complex descriptions of a physical
system. Our result is that such statistical mechanical descriptions can be used
to create transparent, computable, experimentally-relevant models that may be
informed by more detailed atomistic simulations. We also derive a theory for
the kinetic behavior of this system, identifying the nonequilibrium `process'
free energy functional. The Gibbs relation for this functional is a
fluctuation-dissipation theorem applicable arbitrarily far from equilibrium,
that captures the effect of non-local and time-dependent behavior from
transient driving forces. Based on this work, it is clear that statistical
mechanics is a general tool for constructing the relationships between

spectroscopic survey VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) comprising ~4800 galaxies. We
find that for z<2, in the interval of magnitudes considered by this survey, the
LFs obtained using photometric and spectroscopic redshifts show a remarkable
agreement. This good agreement led us to use all four Deep fields of CFHTLS
comprising ~386000 galaxies to compute the LF of the combined fields and
estimate directly the error in the parameters based on field-to-field
variation. We find that the characteristic absolute magnitude M* of Schechter
fits fades by ~0.7mag from z~1.8 to z~0.3, while the characteristic density
phi* increases by a factor of ~4 in the same redshift bin. We use the galaxy
classification provided by the template fitting program used to compute
photometric redshifts and split the sample into galaxy types. We find that
these Schechter parameters evolve differently for each galaxy type, an
indication that their evolution is a combination of several effects: galaxy
merging, star formation quenching and mass assembly. All these results are
compatible with those obtained by different spectroscopic surveys such as VVDS,
DEEP2 and zCosmos, which reinforces the fact that photometric redshifts can be
used to study galaxy evolution, at least for the redshift bins adopted so far.
This is of great interest since future very large imaging surveys containing
hundreds of millions of galaxies will allow to obtain important precise
measurements to constrain the evolution of the LF and to explore the dependence
of this evolution on morphology and/or color helping constrain the mechanisms
of galaxy evolution.

(diffuse) measures on the domain $\Omega$. The uniform Glivenko--Cantelli
property with respect to non-atomic measures is no longer a necessary
condition, and consistent learnability cannot in general be expected. Our
criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter $\VC({\mathscr
C}\,{\mathrm{mod}}\,\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of $\mathscr C$
modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by ""thickening up"" single
points in the definition of VC dimension to uncountable ""clusters"".
Equivalently, $\VC(\mathscr C\modd\omega_1)\leq d$ if and only if every
countable subclass of $\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\leq d$ outside a
countable subset of $\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed as the
classical VC dimension of $\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset of a
compactification of $\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions on
$\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA). Similar
results are obtained for function learning in terms of fat-shattering dimension
modulo countable sets, but, just like in the classical distribution-free case,
the finiteness of this parameter is sufficient but not necessary for PAC
learnability under non-atomic measures.

and average delay of two user slotted ALOHA over a Gilbert-Elliott channel,
where users have channel state information and adapt their transmission
probabilities according to the channel state. Each channel has two states,
namely, the 'good' and 'bad' states. In the 'bad' state, the channel is assumed
to be in deep fade and the transmission fails with probability one, while in
the 'good' state, there is some positive success probability. We calculate the
Stability region with and without Multipacket Reception capability as well as
the average delay without MPR. Our results show that the stability region of
the controlled S-ALOHA is always a superset of the stability region of
uncontrolled S-ALOHA. Moreover, if the channel tends to be in the 'bad' state
for long proportion of time, then the stability region is a convex Polyhedron
strictly containing the TDMA stability region and the optimal transmission
strategy is to transmit with probability one whenever the nodes have packets
and it is shown that this strategy is delay optimal. On the other hand, if the
channel tends to be in the 'good' state more often, then the stability region
is bounded by a convex curve and is strict subset of the TDMA stability region.
We also show that enhancing the physical layer by allowing MPR capability can
significantly enhance the performance while simplifying the MAC Layer design by
the lack of the need of scheduling under some conditions. Furthermore, it is
shown that transmission control not only allows handling higher stable arrival
rates but also leads to lower delay for the same arrival rate compared with
ordinary S-ALOHA.

vector field topology for 2-D vector fields. Vector field topology is defined
for steady vector fields and aims at discriminating the domain of a vector
field into regions of qualitatively different behaviour. The presented approach
represents a generalization for saddle-type critical points and their
separatrices to unsteady vector fields based on generalized streak lines, with
the classical vector field topology as its special case for steady vector
fields. The concept is closely related to that of Lagrangian coherent
structures obtained as ridges in the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field. The
proposed approach is evaluated on both 2-D time-dependent synthetic and vector
fields from computational fluid dynamics.

so severely by several problems encountered in young clusters, such as
intra-cluster extinction and large uncertainties in brown dwarf models. We
present the results of a deep photometric survey to study the MF of the central
region of the old open cluster Praesepe (age~590$^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr, distance
~190$^{+6.0}_{-5.8}$ pc), down to the substellar regime. We performed an
optical ($riz$ and $Y$-band) photometric survey of Praesepe using the Large
Binocular Telescope Camera covering an area of ~0.59 deg$^2$ in the cluster
centre from $i$~19.0 mag (~100 M_Jup) down to a 5$\sigma$ detection limit at
$i$~25.6mag (~40 M_Jup). The survey is approximately 95% complete at $i=23.8$
mag and $z=22.0$ mag (~55 M_Jup). We identify 59 cluster member candidates, of
which 37 are substellar, by comparing with the predictions of a dusty
atmosphere model. The MF of those candidates rises from the substellar boundary
until ~67 M_Jup and then declines. This is quite different from the form
inferred for other open clusters older than 50 Myr, but seems to be similar to
those found in very young open clusters, the MFs of which peak at ~10 M_Jup.
Either Praesepe really does have a different MF from other clusters or they had
similar initial MFs but a different dynamical evolution. Since most of the
candidates are faint, we lack astrometric or spectroscopic follow-ups to test
their memberships. However, the contaminations by field dwarfs, galaxies, or
giants are found to have little effect on the shape of MF and therefore the MF
of `real' cluster members should have similar characteristics.

a substantial fraction of the ejected mass does not reach the escape velocity.
To reach this conclusion we use a self-similar solution under simplifying
assumptions. Most of the gravitational energy of a companion white dwarf (WD)
is released in the envelope of a massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) or the
red giant branch (RGB) star in a very short time. This rapid energy release
forms a blast wave in the envelope. We follow the blast wave propagation from
the center of the AGB outwards, and show that ~1-10 per cent of the ejected
envelope remains bound to the remnant binary system. We suggest that due to
angular momentum conservation and further interaction with the binary system,
the fallback material forms a circumbinary disk around the post-AGB Core and
the companion WD. The interaction of the circumbinary disk with the binary
system will reduce the orbital separation much more than expected from the
dynamical phase (where the envelope is ejected) of the CE alone. The smaller
orbital separation favors a merger at the end of the CE phase or a short time
after, while the core is still hot. This is another channel to form a massive
WD with super-Chandrasekhar mass that might explode as a type Ia supernova. We
term this the core-degenerate (CD) scenario.

order and lead to a superfluid of boson pairs if the spin-orbit coupling is
isotropic or nearly isotropic. Such a phase supports fractionalized quantum
vortices. The Kosterlize-Thouless transition from superfluid to normal state is
driven by proliferation of half vortices. When the ground state is a plane wave

Kosterlize-Thouless transition. However, the critical temperature will drop to
zero for isotropic spin-orbit coupling.

with minimum degree $\delta$, the rainbow connection number is upper bounded by

Induction, a formal inductive framework which combines algorithmic information
theory with the Bayesian framework. Although it achieves excellent theoretical
results and is based on solid philosophical foundations, the requisite
technical knowledge necessary for understanding this framework has caused it to
remain largely unknown and unappreciated in the wider scientific community. The

as criticisms of Solomonoff and induction in general. In particular we examine
how Solomonoff induction addresses many issues that have plagued other

a-invariant of a subalgebra A. In particular we show that if $A \subset B$ is a
finite homogeneous inclusion of standard graded domains over an algebraically
closed field with A normal and B of minimal multiplicity then A has minimal
multiplicity. In some sense these results are algebraic generalizations of
Hurwitz type theorems.

investigate the background and perturbation evolution in this model,
calculating the most general quadratic actions for tensor and scalar
cosmological perturbations to give the stability criteria and the power spectra

continuum and the 12CO(J=3-2), 13CO(J=3-2), 13CO(J=2-1), C18O(J=2-1),
HCN(J=3-2), HCO+(J=4-3) and HCO+(J=3-2) line emission in the circumnuclear disk
(r=100pc) of the proto-typical Seyfert type-2 galaxy NGC1068, carried out with
the Submillimeter Array. We further include in our analysis new 13CO(J=1-0) and
improved 12CO(J=2-1) observations of NGC1068 at high angular resolution
(1.0-2.0"") and sensitivity, conducted with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer. Based on the complex dynamics of the molecular gas emission
indicating non-circular motions in the central ~100pc, we propose a scenario in
which part of the molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk of NGC1068 is
radially blown outwards as a result of shocks. This shock scenario is further
supported by quite warm (Tkin>=200K) and dense (nH2=10^4cm^-3) gas constrained
from the observed molecular line ratios. The HCN abundance in the circumnuclear
disk is found to be [HCN]/[12CO]=10^-3.5. This is slightly higher than the
abundances derived for galactic and extragalactic starforming/starbursting
regions. This results lends further support to X-ray enhanced HCN formation in
the circumnuclear disk of NGC1068, as suggested by earlier studies. The HCO+
abundance ([HCO+]/[12CO]=10^-5) appears to be somewhat lower than that of
galactic and extragalactic starforming/starbursting regions. When trying to fit
the cm to mm continuum emission by different thermal and non-thermal processes,
it appears that electron-scattered synchrotron emission yields the best results
while thermal free-free emission seems to over-predict the mm continuum
emission.

Kagan-Maximov (Flynn-Stoneham) mechanism at phonon scattering. According to the
presented model, the probability of proton location in shallow potential well
(point mutation form) is directly proportional to temperature. It was shown
that the point mutation probability decreases with increasing replication

cross-sections, being sinusoidal, change sign along the baseline; some start
positive and some negative at the collision point. For each of them one seeks
the baseline distance to the first differential cross-section maximum.

describe many common problems, it seems to have limitation in solving more
complicated problem with more constrains, like resource leveling which is
actually a NP problem. This paper tries to find a better solution for it by
using neural network. In order to give the neural network description of
resource leveling problem, a new description method called Augmented permute
matrix is proposed by expending the ability of the traditional one. An Embedded
Hybrid Model combining Hopfield model and SA are put forward to improve the
optimization in essence in which Hopfield servers as State Generator for the
SA. The experiment results show that Augmented permute matrix is able to
completely and appropriately describe the application. The energy function and
hybrid model given in this study are also highly efficient in solving resource
leveling problem.
