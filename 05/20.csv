contacts between a normal metal and a multi-band superconductor with extended
s\pm pairing symmetry. We demonstrate that the interband impurity scattering
broadens the coherent peak near the superconducting gap and significantly
reduces its height even at relatively low scattering rates. This broadening is
consistent with a number of recent experiments performed for both tunnel
junctions and larger diffusive contacts. Our theory helps to better evaluate
the energy gap of iron-based superconductors from point contact Andreev
spectroscopy measurements.

sampled chaotic attractors as a function of the sampling period {\tau}. It is
shown that if the Bandt and Pompe procedure is used to assign a probability
distribution function (PDF) to the pertinent time series, the statistical
complexity measure (SCM) attains a definite maximum for a specific sampling
period tM. If the usual histogram approach is used instead in order to assign
the PDF to the time series, the SCM remains almost constant at any sampling
period {\tau}. The significance of tM is further investigated by comparing it
with typical times given in the literature for the two main reconstruction
processes: the Takens' one in a delay-time embedding, and the exact
Nyquist-Shannon reconstruction. It is shown that tM is compatible with those
times recommended as adequate delay ones in Takens' reconstruction. The
reported results correspond to three representative chaotic systems having
correlation dimension 2 < D2 < 3. One recent experiment confirms the analysis

be described in terms of polycrystalline vacuum. Viewed in this way, special
relativity is not a primitive concept, but rather it statistically emerges when
a coarse graining average over distances of order, or longer than the Compton
wavelength is taken. By analyzing the robustness of such a special relativity
under small variations in the polycrystalline grain-size distribution we
naturally arrive at the notion of doubly-special relativistic dynamics. In this
way, a previously unsuspected, common statistical origin of the two frameworks
is brought to light. Salient issues such as the role of gauge fixing in
emergent relativity, generalized commutation relations, Hausdorff dimensions of
representative path-integral trajectories and a connection with Feynman

data have received considerable attention both in practical applications and
theoretical analysis. In particular, the convergence of graph Laplacians
obtained from sampled data to certain continuous operators has become an active
research topic recently. Most of the existing work has been done under the
assumption that the data is sampled from a manifold without boundary or that
the functions of interests are evaluated at a point away from the boundary.
However, the question of boundary behavior is of considerable practical and
theoretical interest. In this paper we provide an analysis of the behavior of
graph Laplacians at a point near or on the boundary, discuss their convergence
rates and their implications and provide some numerical results. It turns out
that while points near the boundary occupy only a small part of the total
volume of a manifold, the behavior of graph Laplacian there has different
scaling properties from its behavior elsewhere on the manifold, with global
effects on the whole manifold, an observation with potentially important
implications for the general problem of learning on manifolds.

realistic ontology for quantum mechanics, based on two main ideas. First, a
logic (system of reasoning) is employed which is compatible with the
Hilbert-space structure of quantum mechanics as understood by von Neumann:
quantum properties and their negations correspond to subspaces and their
orthogonal complements. It employs a special (single framework) syntactical
rule to construct meaningful quantum expressions, quite different from the
quantum logic of Birkhoff and von Neumann. Second, quantum time development is
treated as an inherently stochastic process under all circumstances, not just
when measurements take place. The time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation
provides probabilities, not a deterministic time development of the world. The
resulting interpretive framework has no measurement problem and can be used to
analyze in quantum terms what is going on before, after, and during physical
preparation and measurement processes. In particular, appropriate measurements
can reveal quantum properties possessed by the measured system before the
measurement took place. There are no mysterious superluminal influences:
quantum systems satisfy an appropriate form of Einstein locality. This ontology
provides a satisfactory foundation for quantum information theory, since it
supplies definite answers as to what the information is about. The formalism of
classical (Shannon) information theory applies without change in suitable
quantum contexts, and this suggests the way in which quantum information theory
extends beyond its classical counterpart.

properties of the mantle, their tidal counterparts are determined both by the
bulk properties and self-gravitation of a body as a whole. For a qualitative
estimate, we model the body with a homogeneous sphere and express the tidal
phase lag through the lag in a sample of material. Although simplistic, our
model is sufficient to understand that the lags are not identical. The
difference emerges because self-gravitation pulls the tidal bulge down. At low
frequencies, this reduces strain and makes tidal damping less efficient in
larger bodies. At high frequencies, competition between self-gravitation and
rheology becomes more complex, though for sufficiently large superearths the
same rule works: the larger the body, the weaker tidal damping in it. Being
negligible for small terrestrial planets and moons, the difference between the
seismic and tidal lagging (and likewise between the seismic and tidal damping)
becomes very considerable for superearths. In those, it is much lower than what
one might expect from using a seismic quality factor. The tidal damping rate
deviates from the seismic damping rate especially in the zero-frequency limit,
and this difference takes place for bodies of any size. So the equal in
magnitude but opposite in sign tidal torques, exerted on one another by the
primary and the secondary, go smoothly through zero as the secondary crosses
the synchronous orbit. We describe the mantle rheology with the Andrade model,
allowing it to lean towards the Maxwell model at the lowest frequencies. To
implement this additional flexibility, we reformulate the Andrade model by
endowing it with a free parameter which is the ratio of the anelastic timescale
to the viscoelastic Maxwell time of the mantle. Some uncertainty in this
parameter's frequency-dependence does not influence our principal conclusions.

The optical conductivity spectra contain, in addition to the free carrier
response at low frequency, a temperature-dependent gap-like suppression at
rather high energy scale near 0.6 eV. This suppression evolves with the
As-Fe-As bond angle induced by electron- or hole-doping. Furthermore, the
feature becomes much weaker in the Fe-chalcogenide compounds. We elaborate that
the feature is caused by the strong Hund's rule coupling effect between the
itinerant electrons and localized electron moment arising from the multiple Fe

which is complete to an extinction-corrected K-band magnitude of 13.25 and has
spectroscopic redshifts for roughly 40% of the galaxies, including nearly all
brighter than K = 11.25. We then use a stacking analysis to determine the
average luminosity function, radial distribution, and velocity distribution of
cluster galaxies in several richness classes, and use the results to update the
parameters of the matched filter before repeating the cluster search. We also
investigate the correlations between a cluster's richness and its velocity
dispersion and core radius, using these relations to refine priors that are
applied during the cluster search process. After the second cluster search
iteration, we repeat the stacking analysis. We find a cluster galaxy luminosity
function that fits a Schechter form, with parameters M_K* - 5 log h =
-23.64\pm0.04 and \alpha = -1.07\pm0.03. We can achieve a slightly better fit
to our luminosity function by adding a Gaussian component on the bright end to
represent the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) population. The radial number
density profile of galaxies closely matches a projected Navarro-Frenk-White

well-known cluster centering issues and outside the virial radius due to
correlated structure. The velocity distributions are Gaussian in shape, with

shown that while the Galilei group is a deformation of the Poincar\'e group,
and the Poincar\'e group is a deformation of the conformal group, the conformal
group ends the road, it is {\em rigid\}. There are thus compelling mathematical
and physical reasons for promoting the conformal group to the role of the
fundamental symmetry of space--time, more important than the Poincar\'e group
that formed the group-theoretical basis of special and general theories of
relativity. While the action of the conformal group on Minkowski space is
singular, it naturally extends to a nonsingular action on the compactified
Minkowski space, often referred to in the literature as ""Minkowski space plus
light-cone at infinity"". Unfortunately in some textbooks the true structure of
the compactified Minkowski space is sometimes misrepresented, including false
proofs and statements that are simply wrong. In this paper we present in, a
simple way, two different constructions of the compactified Minkowski space,
both stemming from the original idea of Roger Penrose, but putting stress on
the mathematically subtle points and relating the constructions to the Clifford
algebra tools. In particular the little-known antilinear Hodge star operator is
introduced in order to connect real and complex structures of the algebra. A
possible relation to Waldyr Rodrigues' idea of gravity as a plastic deformation
of Minkowski's vacuum is also indicated.

analysis is applied to orbits around an oblate central object with a distant
perturber. If the equatorial plane of the central object is aligned with the
orbit of the distant perturber (axisymmetric potential), a single instability
zone, in which eccentricity grows exponentially, is found between two critical
inclinations; if misaligned (non-axisymmetric potential), a rich set of
critical inclinations separating stable and unstable zones is obtained
(Vashkoviak 1974). The analysis is also applied to a general quadratic
potential. Similarly, for non-axisymmetric cases, multiple stability and
instability zones are obtained. Here eccentricity can reach very high values in
the instability zones even when the potential's deviation from axisymmetry is
small.

<r_e> = 1.66 \pm 0.79 kpc (i.e., ~ 50-70% the size of local late-type galaxies

incorporate strong feedback from star forming regions. The mean half-light

Poiseuille problem. For several values of the wavenumber $\alpha$, we obtain
the branch of periodic flows which are born at the Hopf bifurcation of the
laminar flow. It is known that, taking $\alpha\approx1$, the branch of periodic
solutions has several Hopf bifurcations to quasi-periodic orbits. For the first
bifurcation, previous calculations seem to indicate that the bifurcating
quasi-periodic flows are stable and go backwards with respect to the Reynolds
number, $Re$. By improving the precision of previous works we find that the
bifurcating flows are unstable and go forward with respect to $Re$. We have
also analysed the second Hopf bifurcation of periodic orbits for several
$\alpha$, to find again quasi-periodic solutions with increasing $Re$. In this
case the bifurcated solutions are stable to superharmonic disturbances for $Re$
up to another new Hopf bifurcation to a family of stable 3-tori. The proposed
numerical scheme is based on a full numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes
equations, together with a division by 3 of their total dimension, and the use
of a pseudo-Newton method on suitable Poincar\'e sections. The most intensive
part of the computations has been performed in parallel. We believe that this
methodology can also be applied to similar problems.

continue to dominate their profiles at 17 GHz. Older pulsars (>10^5 years)
appear to be almost completely depolarised. Our detection of PSR J0437-4715 is
the highest frequency observation of a millisecond pulsar to date, and implies
a luminosity at 17 GHz of 14 {\mu}Jy kpc^2, and a mean spectral index of 2.2.
We find that the spectral index of the magnetar PSR J1622-4950 is flat between
1.4 and 24 GHz, similar to the other known radio magnetars XTE J1810-197 and 1E

polarised. Analysis of the frequency evolution of the profile of PSR J0835-4510

in their amplitude. The width and separation of the components remains fixed
and the spectral index of each component can be determined independently.

theories in D space-time dimensions are described by requiring open strings to
end on a stack of N Dp-branes of space-time dimension D=p+1. The large N
leading trajectory \alpha(t)=1+\alpha' t+\Sigma(t) can be extracted, through
order g^2, from the s\to-\infty limit, at fixed t, of the four open string tree

\Sigma(t)\sim-Cg^2(-\alpha' t)^{(D-4)/2}/(D-4). This result precisely tracks
the 1-loop Reggeized gluon of gauge theory in D>4 space-time dimensions. In
particular, for D\to4 it reproduces the known infrared divergences of gauge
theory in 4 dimensions with a Regge trajectory behaving as -\ln(-\alpha^\prime
t). We also study \Sigma(t) in the limit t\to-\infty and show that, when D<8,
it behaves as \alpha^\prime t/(\ln(-\alpha^\prime t))^{\gamma}, where \gamma>0
depends on D and the number of massless scalars. Thus, as long as 4<D<8, the
1-loop correction stays small relative to the tree trajectory for the whole

ranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, and
naturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelength

extreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. By
integrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities in
different redshift ranges. This approach allows for efficient, consistent, and
fast classification and photometric redshift estimation. This is achieved by
combining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basis
of our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through the
use of many simple components with many parameters. We show that this technique
is competitive with the best photometric quasar classification
techniques---which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and high
signal-to-noise ratio data---and with the best photometric redshift techniques
when applied to broadband optical data. We demonstrate that the inclusion of UV
and NIR data significantly improves photometric quasar--star separation and
essentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent to
the ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noise
ratio. For quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the SDSS 84 and 97 percent of
the objects with GALEX UV and UKIDSS NIR data have photometric redshifts within
0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to about
a factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. Our code

consistent with a significant component of the electron and positron fluxes
between 20 GeV and 1 TeV being produced through dark matter annihilation or
decay. However, since the measurements are also consistent with astrophysical
interpretations, the message is unclear. In this paper, we point out that dark
matter can have a more distinct signal in cosmic rays, that of a charge
asymmetry. Such charge asymmetry can result if the dark matter's abundance is
due to a relic asymmetry, allowing its decay to generate an asymmetry in
positrons and electrons. This is analogous to the baryon asymmetry, where
decaying neutrons produce electrons and not positrons. We explore benchmark
scenarios where the dark matter decays into a leptophilic charged Higgs boson
or electroweak gauge bosons. These models have observable signals in gamma rays
and neutrinos, which can be tested by Fermi and IceCube. The most powerful test
will be at AMS-02, given its ability to distinguish electron and positron
charge above 100 GeV. Specifically, an asymmetry favoring positrons typically
predicts a larger positron ratio and a harder (softer) high energy spectrum for
positrons (electrons) than charge symmetric sources. We end with a brief
discussion on how such scenarios differ from the leading astrophysical
explanations.

significant performance gains over the legacy direct transmission scheme.
Compared with single relay based cooperation schemes, utilizing multiple relays
further improves the reliability and rate of transmissions. Distributed
space-time coding (DSTC), as one of the schemes to utilize multiple relays,
requires tight coordination between relays and does not perform well in a
distributed environment with mobility. In this paper, a cooperative medium
access control (MAC) layer protocol, called \emph{STiCMAC}, is designed to
allow multiple relays to transmit at the same time in an IEEE 802.11 network.
The transmission is based on a novel DSTC scheme called \emph{randomized
distributed space-time coding} (\emph{R-DSTC}), which requires minimum
coordination. Unlike conventional cooperation schemes that pick nodes with good
links, \emph{STiCMAC} picks a \emph{transmission mode} that could most improve
the end-to-end data rate. Any station that correctly receives from the source
can act as a relay and participate in forwarding. The MAC protocol is
implemented in a fully decentralized manner and is able to opportunistically
recruit relays on the fly, thus making it \emph{robust} to channel variations
and user mobility. Simulation results show that the network capacity and delay
performance are greatly improved, especially in a mobile environment.

evaluating slightly more complicated expressions. However, the simplified
log-normal approximation, although as simple as the normal approximation,
yields confidence regions that are almost as accurate as those obtained from
the log-normal approximation. The empirical corrections to the normal
approximation do not yield more accurate covariances and confidence regions
than the (simplified) log-normal approximation. Moreover, they fail to produce
positive-semidefinite data covariance matrices in certain cases, rendering them
unusable for parameter estimation. The simplified log-normal approximation
should be used in favour of the normal approximation for parameter estimation
and parameter error forecasts. Any approximation to the cosmic shear covariance
should ensure a positive-semidefinite data covariance matrix.

Dipolar Frustrated Ising Ferromagnet. We show that this system has an
Ising-nematic phase at low temperatures in the square lattice, where positional

Ginsburg-Landau theory, which has an isotropic-nematic phase transition with

most massive stars, and the manner in which protostars continue to accrete and
grow in mass beyond \sim10Msun is still a controversial topic. In this study we
use several prescriptions of stellar accretion and a description of the
Galactic gas distribution to simulate the luminosities and spatial distribution
of massive protostellar population of the Galaxy. We then compare the
observables of each simulation to the results of the Red MSX Source (RMS)
survey, a recently compiled database of massive young stellar objects. We find
that the observations are best matched by accretion rates which increase as the
protostar grows in mass, such as those predicted by the turbulent core and
competitive accretion (i.e. Bondi-Hoyle) models. These 'accelerating accretion'
models provide very good qualitative and quantitative fits to the data, though
we are unable to distinguish between these two models on our simulations alone.
We rule out models with accretion rates which are constant with time, and those
which are initially very high and which fall away with time, as these produce
results which are quantitatively and/or qualitatively incompatible with the
observations. To simultaneously match the low- and high-luminosity YSO
distribution we require the inclusion of a 'swollen-star' pre-main-sequence
phase, the length of which is well-described by the Kelvin-Helmholz timescale.
Our results suggest that the lifetime of the YSO phase is \sim 10^5yrs, whereas
the compact Hii-region phase lasts between \sim 2 - 4 \times 10^5yrs depending
on the final mass of the star. Finally, the absolute numbers of YSOs are best
matched by a globally averaged star-formation rate for the Galaxy of
1.5-2Msun/yr.

model at finite temperature including the baryon octet and neutrino trapping.
For quark matter we use an $SU(3)_f$ Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model including color
superconductivity. The finite size effects on the just deconfined droplets are
considered in the frame of the multiple reflection expansion. In addition, we
consider that just deconfined quark matter is transitorily out of equilibrium
respect to weak interaction, and we impose color neutrality and flavor
conservation during the transition. We calculate self-consistently the surface
tension and curvature energy density of the quark hadron inter-phase and find
that it is larger than the values typically assumed in the literature. The
transition density is calculated for drops of different sizes, and at different
temperatures and neutrino trapping conditions. Then, we show that
energy-density fluctuations are much more relevant for deconfinement than
temperature and neutrino density fluctuations. We calculate the critical size
spectrum of energy-density fluctuations that allows deconfinement as well as
the nucleation rate of each critical bubble. We find that drops with any radii
smaller than 800 fm can be formed at a huge rate when matter achieves the bulk
transition limit of 5-6 times the nuclear saturation density.

for gamma gamma^* \to M using light-front holographic methods. The Chern-Simons
action, which is a natural form in 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space,
leads directly to an expression for the photon-to-pion TFF for a class of
confining models. Remarkably, the predicted pion TFF is identical to the
leading order QCD result where the distribution amplitude has asymptotic form.
The Chern-Simons form is local in AdS space and is thus somewhat limited in its
predictability. It only retains the q \bar q component of the pion
wavefunction, and further, it projects out only the asymptotic form of the
meson distribution amplitude. It is found that in order to describe
simultaneously the decay process \pi^0 \rightarrow gamma gamma and the pion TFF
at the asymptotic limit, a probability for the q \bar q component of the pion
wavefunction P_{q \bar q}=0.5 is required; thus giving indication that the
contributions from higher Fock states in the pion light-front wavefunction need
to be included in the analysis. The probability for the Fock state containing
four quarks (anti-quarks) which follows from analyzing the hadron matrix
elements, P_{q \bar q q \bar q} \sim 10 %, agrees with the analysis of the pion
elastic form factor using light-front holography including higher Fock
components in the pion wavefunction. The results for the TFFs for the eta and
eta^\prime mesons are also presented. The rapid growth of the pion TFF
exhibited by the BaBar data at high Q^2 is not compatible with the models
discussed in this article, whereas the theoretical calculations are in
agreement with the experimental data for the eta and eta^\prime TFFs.

shown experimentally to be capable of producing accurate reconstructions from
sparse-view data. In particular TV-based reconstruction is very well suited for
images with piecewise nearly constant regions. Computationally, however,
TV-based reconstruction is much more demanding, especially for 3D imaging, and
the reconstruction from clinical data sets is far from being close to
real-time. This is undesirable from a clinical perspective, and thus there is
an incentive to accelerate the solution of the underlying optimization problem.
The TV reconstruction can in principle be found by any optimization method, but
in practice the large-scale systems arising in CT image reconstruction preclude
the use of memory-demanding methods such as Newton's method. The simple
gradient method has much lower memory requirements, but exhibits slow
convergence. In the present work we consider the use of two accelerated
gradient-based methods, GPBB and UPN, for reducing the number of gradient
method iterations needed to achieve a high-accuracy TV solution in CT image
reconstruction. The former incorporates several heuristics from the
optimization literature such as Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step size selection and
nonmonotone line search. The latter uses a cleverly chosen sequence of
auxiliary points to achieve a better convergence rate. The methods are memory
efficient and equipped with a stopping criterion to ensure that the TV
reconstruction has indeed been found. An implementation of the methods (in C
with interface to Matlab) is available for download from
http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~pch/TVReg/. We compare the proposed methods with the
standard gradient method, applied to a 3D test problem with synthetic few-view
data. We find experimentally that for realistic parameters the proposed methods
significantly outperform the gradient method.

The bombs flare repetitively with much rapid variation at time scales of

consequence of rapid migration of planetesimals and low mass cores into
specific trapping sites in protoplanetary discs. We present analytical modeling
of inhomogeneities in protoplanetary discs around a variety of young stars, -
from Herbig Ae/Be to classical T Tauri and down to M stars, - and show how they
give rise to planet traps. The positions of these traps define the initial
orbital distribution of multiple protoplanets. We investigate both corotation
and Lindblad torques, and show that a new trap arises from the
(entropy-related) corotation torque. This arises at that disc radius where disc
heating changes from viscous to stellar irradiation dominated processes. We
demonstrate that up to three traps (heat transitions, ice lines and dead zones)
can exist in a single disc, and that they move differently as the disc
accretion rate $\dot{M}$ decreases with time. The interaction between the giant
planets which grow in such traps may be a crucial ingredient for establishing
planetary systems. We also demonstrate that the position of planet traps
strongly depends on stellar masses and disc accretion rates. This indicates
that host stars establish preferred scales of planetary systems formed around
them. We discuss the potential of planet traps induced by ice lines of various
molecules such as water and CO, and estimate the maximum and minimum mass of
planets which undergo type I migration. We finally apply our analyses to
accounting for the initial conditions proposed in the Nice model for the origin

superfluid order parameter changes its sign across the barrier. Because of
this, the phase of the superfluid order parameter outside the junction is shown
to be twisted by $\pi$ along the ring, which naturally leads to a circulating
supercurrent. While the ordinary supercurrent state is obtained as a metastable

relation between an annihilation and creation operators, deduces that a point
mass can be described by a Gaussian function instead of the usual Dirac delta
function. However, we argue this specific quantization by adopting the
canonical one (based on the canonical commutation relation between a field and
its conjugate momentum) and show that a point mass should still be described by
the Dirac delta function, which implies that the concept of point particles is
still valid when we deal with the noncommutativity by following the coordinate
coherent states approach. In order to investigate the dependence on
quantization procedures, we apply the two quantization procedures to the Unruh
effect and Hawking radiation and find that they give rise to significantly
different results. Under the first quantization procedure, the Unruh
temperature and Unruh spectrum are not deformed by noncommutativity, but the
Hawking temperature is deformed by noncommutativity while the radiation
specturm is untack. However, under the second quantization procedure, the Unruh
temperature and Hawking temperature are untack but the both spectra are
modified by an effective greybody (deformed) factor.

composed of the kinetic energy including the five Fe 3d-orbitals, the
orthorhombic crystalline electric field (CEF) energy, and the two-orbital
Kugel'-Khomski\u{i}-type superexchange interaction. Our basic assumption is
that the antiferromagnetic (AF) state in the parent compounds can be described
by the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, and that the electrons in these orbitals
have relatively strong electron correlation in the vicinity of the AF state. In
order to study the physical origin of the structure-sensitive SC transition
temperature, the effect of orthorhombic distortion is taken into account as the
energy-splitting, $\Delta_{\textrm{ortho.}}$, between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$
orbitals. We find that the eigenvalue of the linearized gap equation decreases
accompanied with the reduction of the partial density of states for the
$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals as $\Delta_{\textrm{ortho.}}$ increases, and
that the dominant pairing symmetry is an unconventional fully gapped
$s_{+-}$-wave pairing. We also find large anisotropy of the SC gap function in
the orthorhombic phase. We propose that the CEF energy plays an important role
in controlling $T_{\textrm{c}}$ and the SC gap function, and that
orbital-selective superconductivity is a key feature in iron-based
superconductors, which causes the structure-sensitive $T_{\textrm{c}}$.

(1\sigma) with distances based on main sequence fitting method and on kinematic

explicit computation of critical exponents for the decay of avalanches in the
Abelian sandpile model (ASM) on a large family of infinite graphs. We begin by
introducing the notion of criticality of the ASM for limits of finite graphs in
local convergence, which naturally leads to the question about criticality of
the ASM in the random weak limit. Our main technical ingredient is a sufficient
condition for almost sure criticality of the ASM on sequences of finite cacti
(i.e., separable graphs whose blocks are cycles or single edges) under the
assumption that the random weak limit is almost surely 1-ended. Examples that
allow explicit computations of the critical exponents come from actions of
finitely generated groups on regular rooted trees, by automorphisms.
Restricting the action to the consecutive levels of the tree defines a sequence
of finite graphs whose limits in the local convergence are orbital Schreier
graphs for the action of the group on the boundary of the tree. In the case of
iterated monodromy groups of complex polynomials, these graphs are cacti, and
we show that for 1-ended ones, the critical exponent for the decay of the mass
of avalanches depends on the growth of the graph. The well-known Basilica group
related to $z^2-1$ gives rise to uncountably many 4-regular one-ended graphs of
quadratic growth with the critical exponent for the mass of avalanches equal to
1; as well as uncountably many new non-critical examples of quadratic growth
(thus not quasi-isometric to $\mathbb{Z}$). Another iterated monodromy group
that we consider provides uncountably many graphs with the critical exponent
equal to $2\log 2/\log 3 >1$. Finally, we also exhibit graphs of polynomial
growth with arbitrarily small critical exponent.

superfluid neutron stars. The importance of these effects is illustrated with a
simple example of a radially pulsating general relativistic star. Two main
effects are taken into account: (i) temperature dependence of the entrainment
matrix and (ii) the variation of the size of superfluid region with
temperature. Four models are considered, which include either one or both of
these two effects. Pulsation spectra are calculated for these models, and
asymptotes for eigenfrequencies at temperatures close to critical temperature
of neutron superfluidity, are derived. It is demonstrated that models that
allow for the temperature effect (ii) but disregard the effect (i), yield
unrealistic results. Eigenfunctions for the normal- and superfluid-type
pulsations are analyzed. It is shown that superfluid pulsation modes
practically do not appear at the neutron-star surface and, therefore, can
hardly be observed by measuring the modulation of the electromagnetic radiation
from the star. The e-folding times for damping of pulsations due to the shear
viscosity and nonequilibrium modified Urca processes are calculated and their
asymptotes at temperatures close to the neutron critical temperature, are
obtained. It is demonstrated that superfluid pulsation modes are damped by 1--3
orders of magnitude faster than normal modes.

destroyed by the dissipation of the cavities for a finite time interval and the
stationary quantum discord can arise in the interaction of atoms with cavities
as the time approach to infinite. The transition time is sensitive to the
initial state parameter of the two atoms and the mean photon number of the

completely unaffected by the dissipation of the cavities if we choose the

and extreme model for the effect of baryonic physics (neglected in gravity-only
simulations of large-scale structure formation) on the dark-matter. We find
that such an infalling clump is extremely efficient in altering the structure
of the halo and reducing its central density: a clump of 1% the mass of the
halo can remove about twice its own mass from the inner halo and transform a
cusp into a core or weaker cusp. If the clump is subsequently removed,
mimicking a galactic wind, the central halo density is further reduced and the
mass removed from the inner halo doubled. Lighter clumps are even more
efficient: the ratio of removed mass to clump mass increases slightly towards
smaller clump masses. This process is the more efficient the more radially
anisotropic the initial dark-matter velocities. While such a clumpy infall may
be somewhat unrealistic, it demonstrates that the baryons need to transfer only
a small fraction of their initial energy to the dark matter via dynamical
friction to explain the discrepancy between predicted dark-matter density
profiles and those inferred from observations of dark-matter dominated
galaxies.

linear polarization ($Q/I, U/I$) in both these papers. In this paper we extend
these previous works to include the effect of weak oriented magnetic fields
(Hanle effect) on line scattering. We generalize the technique of Stokes vector
decomposition in terms of the irreducible spherical tensors $\mathcal{T}^K_Q$,
developed in \citet{anuknn11}, to the case of RT with Hanle effect. A fast
iterative method of solution (based on the Stabilized Preconditioned
Bi-Conjugate-Gradient technique), developed in \citet{anuetal11}, is now
generalized to the case of RT in magnetized three-dimensional media. We use the
efficient short-characteristics formal solution method for multi-D media,
generalized appropriately to the present context. The main results of this
paper are the following: (1) A comparison of emergent $(I, Q/I, U/I)$ profiles
formed in one-dimensional (1D) media, with the corresponding emergent,
spatially averaged profiles formed in multi-D media, shows that in the
spatially resolved structures, the assumption of 1D may lead to large errors in
linear polarization, especially in the line wings. (2) The multi-D RT in
semi-infinite non-magnetic media causes a strong spatial variation of the
emergent $(Q/I, U/I)$ profiles, which is more pronounced in the line wings. (3)
The presence of a weak magnetic field modifies the spatial variation of the
emergent $(Q/I, U/I)$ profiles in the line core, by producing significant
changes in their magnitudes.

using general quantum probe states entangled over M signal and M' idler mode
pairs of which the signal modes are bounced off the beam splitter while the
idler modes are retained losslessly. We obtain a lower bound on the output
state fidelity valid for any pure input state. We define number-diagonal signal
(NDS) states to be input states whose density operator in the signal modes is
diagonal in the multimode number basis. For such input states, we derive series
formulas for the optimal error probability, the output state fidelity, and the
Chernoff-type upper bounds on the error probability. For the special cases of
quantum reading of a classical digital memory and target detection (for which
the reflectivities are real valued), we show that for a given input signal
photon probability distribution, the fidelity is minimized by the NDS states
with that distribution and that for a given average total signal energy N_s,
the fidelity is minimized by any multimode Fock state with N_s total signal
photons. For reading of an ideal memory, it is shown that Fock state inputs
minimize the Chernoff bound. For target detection under high-loss conditions, a
no-go result showing the lack of appreciable quantum advantage over coherent
state transmitters is derived. A comparison of the error probability
performance for quantum reading of number state and two-mode squeezed vacuum
state (or EPR state) transmitters relative to coherent state transmitters is
presented for various values of the reflectances. While the nonclassical states
in general perform better than the coherent state, the quantitative performance

the absence/presence of a temperature inversion; the possible maintenance, via

hyperviscosity and hence its utility in distinguishing between different hot

explained by probing their conformational properties using small angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS). The SAXS studies indicate assembly of elongated PEDOT-PSS
globules on the walls of nanotubes, coating them partially thereby limiting the
interaction between the nanotubes in the polymer matrix. This results in a
charge transport governed mainly by small polarons in the conducting polymer
despite the presence of metallic MWNTs. At T > 4 K, hopping of the charge
carriers following 1D-VRH is evident which also gives rise to a positive
magnetoresistance (MR) with an enhanced localization length (~ 5 nm) due to the
presence of MWNTs. However, at T < 4 K, the observation of an unconventional
positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) is attributed to small
polaron tunnelling. The exceptionally large negative MR observed in this
temperature regime is conjectured to be due to the presence of quasi-1D MWNTs
that can aid in lowering the tunnelling barrier across the nanotube - polymer
boundary resulting in large delocalization.

histograms of the pixel values that lie within a fixed neighborhood of any
given pixel location. Such transforms are useful in image processing
applications such as classification and segmentation, especially when dealing
with textures that can be distinguished by the distributions of their pixel
intensities and colors. We, in particular, use them to identify and delineate
biological tissues found in histology images obtained via digital microscopy.
In this paper, we introduce a mathematical formalism that rigorously justifies
the use of local histograms for such purposes. We begin by discussing how local
histograms can be computed as systems of convolutions. We then introduce
probabilistic image models that can emulate textures one routinely encounters
in histology images. These models are rooted in the concept of image occlusion.
A simple model may, for example, generate textures by randomly speckling opaque
blobs of one color on top of blobs of another. Under certain conditions, we
show that, on average, the local histograms of such model-generated-textures
are convex combinations of more basic distributions. We further provide several
methods for creating models that meet these conditions; the textures generated
by some of these models resemble those found in histology images. Taken
together, these results suggest that histology textures can be analyzed by
decomposing their local histograms into more basic components. We conclude with
a proof-of-concept segmentation-and-classification algorithm based on these
ideas, supported by numerical experimentation.

galaxies are spiral-like with bulge to disc ratios typical of Sb and Sc
galaxies. We find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1
and 6:1 are nearly always classified as Fast Rotators according to the Atlas3D
criterion (based on the lambda_R parameter): they preserve the structure of the
input fast rotating spiral progenitors. They have intrinsic ellipticities
larger than 0.5, cover intrinsic lambda_R values between 0.2 and 0.6, within
the range of observed Fast Rotators. Major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and
1:1) lead to both Fast and Slow Rotators. Most of the Fast Rotators produced in
major mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities between 0.4 and
0.6. Most Slow Rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellar
Kinematically Distinct Core (KDC) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these KDCs
are built from the stellar components of the progenitors. Besides a handful of
specific observed systems -- the counter-rotating discs (2-sigma galaxies) --
these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of Slow Rotators in
the nearby Universe. The mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamental
parameter for the formation of Slow Rotators in these binary mergers, but it
also requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (Sb) progenitor galaxy
with respect to the orbital angular momentum. (Abridged)

general linear groups over a finite field of fixed order q as the dimension n
approaches infinity, namely $(1-q^{-5}) \prod_{i=3}^\infty (1-q^{-i}) = 1 -
q^{-3} + O(q^{-4}).$ We study cyclic matrices in a maximal reducible matrix
group or algebra, that is, in the largest subgroup or subalgebra that leaves
invariant some proper nontrivial subspace. We modify Wall's generating function
approach to determine the limiting proportions of cyclic matrices in maximal
reducible matrix groups and algebras over a field of order q, as the dimension
of the underlying vector space increases while that of the invariant subspace
remains fixed. The limiting proportion in a maximal reducible group is proved
to be $1 - q^{-2} + O(q^{-3})$; note the change of the exponent of q in the

appears as a feature common to the most energetic jets. Although X-ray emission
seems to originate from shocks internal to jets, the mechanism forming these
shocks remains controversial. One of the best studied X-ray jet is HH 154 that
has been observed by Chandra over a time base of about 10 years. We analyze the
Chandra observations of HH 154 by investigating the evolution of its X-ray
source. We show that the X-ray emission consists of a bright stationary

developing a hydrodynamic model describing a protostellar jet originating from
a nozzle and compare the X-ray emission synthesized from the model with the
X-ray observations. The model takes into account the thermal conduction and
radiative losses and shows that the jet/nozzle leads to the formation of a
diamond shock at the nozzle exit. The shock is stationary over the period
covered by our simulations and generates an X-ray source with luminosity and
spectral characteristics in excellent agreement with the observations. We
conclude that the X-ray emission from HH 154 is consistent with a diamond shock
originating from a nozzle through which the jet is launched into the ambient
medium. We suggest that the physical origin of the nozzle could be related to
the dense gas in which the HH 154 driving source is embedded and/or to the
magnetic field at the jet launching/collimation region.

properties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. This has been possible thanks to
the Pacs Evolutionary Probe (PEP) survey of the GOODS South field performed

two-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by the
data reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 Mpc and r_0~6.7 Mpc,
respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo masses
M>~10^{12.4} M_sun. Objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,
with r_0~19 Mpc and r_0~17 Mpc in the two considered PACS channels. This
dramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connected
with the presence of a wide, M>~10^{14} M_sun, filamentary structure which
includes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. An investigation of the
properties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-forming
activity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect of
more isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. Lastly, we also
present our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous and
dark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. We find that the
increase of (average) stellar mass in galaxies <M*> between z~1 and z~2 is
about a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting such
objects (<M*>[z~1]/<M*>[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs M_{halo}[z~1]/M_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). Our
findings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massive
galaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,
while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form of
luminous matter.

fiducial LCDM cosmology by measuring the cumulative distribution function of
the most massive haloes in a sample of subvolumes of identical size tiled on
the sky at a fixed redshift. The fact that the most massive clusters probe the
high-mass tail of the mass function, where the difference between LCDM and
alternative cosmological models is strongest, makes our method particularly
interesting as a cosmological probe. We utilise general extreme value
statistics (GEV) to obtain a cumulative distribution function of the most
massive objects in a given volume. We sample this distribution function
according to the number of patches covered by the survey area for a range of
different ""test cosmologies"" and for differently accurate mass estimations of
the haloes. By fitting this sample with the GEV distribution function, we can
study which parameters are the most sensitive with respect to the test
cosmologies. We find that the peak of the probability distribution function of
the most massive halo is well suited to test the validity of the fiducial LCDM
model, once we are able to establish a sufficiently complete large-area survey
with M_lim=10^14.5 M_sun/h (M_lim=10^14 M_sun/h) at redshifts above z=1
(z=1.5). Being of cumulative nature the proposed measure is robust and an
accuracy of 20-30% in the cluster masses would be sufficient to test for
alternative models. Since one only needs the most massive system in each
angular patch, this method would be ideally suited as a first fast consistency
check before going into a more complex statistical analysis of the observed
halo sample.

influence on terrestrial biological evolution. We know of around 180 high
velocity impact craters on the Earth with ages up to 2400Myr and diameters up
to 300km. Some studies have identified a periodicity in their age distribution,
with periods ranging from 13 to 50Myr. It has further been claimed that such
periods may be causally linked to a periodic motion of the solar system through
the Galactic plane. However, many of these studies suffer from methodological
problems, for example misinterpretation of p-values, overestimation of
significance in the periodogram or a failure to consider plausible alternative
models. Here I develop a Bayesian method for this problem in which impacts are
treated as a stochastic phenomenon. Models for the time variation of the impact
probability are defined and the evidence for them in the geological record is
compared using Bayes factors. This probabilistic approach obviates the need for
ad hoc statistics, and also makes explicit use of the age uncertainties. I find
strong evidence for a monotonic decrease in the recorded impact rate going back
in time over the past 250Myr for craters larger than 5km. The same is found for
the past 150Myr when craters with upper age limits are included. This is
consistent with a crater preservation/discovery bias modulating an otherwise
constant impact rate. The set of craters larger than 35km (so less affected by
erosion and infilling) and younger than 400Myr are best explained by a constant
impact probability model. A periodic variation in the cratering rate is
strongly disfavoured in all data sets. There is also no evidence for a
periodicity superimposed on a constant rate or trend, although this more
complex signal would be harder to distinguish.

faster and to explore the tradeoffs between planning objectives and delivery
efficiency.
  Methods: A convex multicriteria dose optimization problem is solved for an
angular grid of 180 equi-spaced beams. This allows the planner to navigate the
ideal dose distribution Pareto surface and select a plan of desired target
coverage versus organ at risk sparing. The selected plan is then made VMAT
deliverable by a fluence map merging and sequencing algorithm, which combines
neighboring fluence maps based on a similarity score and then delivers the
merged maps together, simplifying delivery. Successive merges are made as long
as the dose distribution quality is maintained. The complete algorithm is
called VMERGE.
  Results: VMERGE is applied to three cases: a prostate, a pancreas, and a
brain. In each case, the selected Pareto-optimal plan is matched almost exactly
with the VMAT merging routine, resulting in a high quality plan delivered with
a single arc in less than five minutes on average.
  VMERGE offers significant improvements over existing VMAT algorithms. The
first is the multicriteria planning aspect, which greatly speeds up planning
time and allows the user to select the plan which represents the most desirable
compromise between target coverage and organ at risk sparing. The second is the
user-chosen epsilon-optimality guarantee of the final VMAT plan. Finally, the
user can explore the tradeoff between delivery time and plan quality, which is
a fundamental aspect of VMAT that cannot be easily investigated with current
commercial planning systems.

neutrino telescope. The algorithm consists of a hit merging and hit selection
procedure followed by fitting steps for a track hypothesis and a point-like
light source. It is particularly well-suited for real time applications such as
online monitoring and fast triggering of optical follow-up observations for
multi-messenger studies. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated with
Monte Carlo simulations and various distributions are compared with that

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/738/1/10",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The origin of kpc-scale holes in the atomic hydrogen (H I) distributions of
some nearby dwarf irregular galaxies presents an intriguing problem. Star
formation histories (SFHs) derived from resolved stars give us the unique
opportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape the
currently visible H I distribution. Our sample of five nearby dwarf irregular
galaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total H I mass and absolute
B-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. We
use Very Large Array H I line data to estimate the energy required to create
the centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. We compare this energy estimate to
the past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed from
SFHs derived from data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The inferred
integrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds our
energy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expected
efficiencies. Therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficient
energy to produce the observed holes. However, we find no obvious signature of
single star forming events responsible for the observed structures when
comparing the global SFHs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or to
those of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. We also fail to
find evidence of a central star cluster in FUV or Halpha imaging. We conclude
that large H I holes are likely formed from multiple generations of star
formation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.

canonical ensemble is mathematically equivalent to the classic approach of
Boltzmann, Gibbs and Darwin-Fowler. The two approaches, however, ""interpret"" a
same mathematical theorem differently; most notably observing mean-energy in
the former and energy conservation in the latter. However, applying the same
MaxEnt method to grand canonical ensemble fails; while carefully following the
classic approach based on Boltzmann's microcanonical {\em equal probability a
priori} produces the correct statistics: One does not need to invoke quantum
mechanics; and there is no Gibbs paradox. MaxEnt and related minimum relative
entropy principle are based on the mathematical theorem concerning large
deviations of rare fluctuations. As a scientific method, it requires classic
mechanics, or some other assumptions, to provide meaningful {\em prior
distributions} for the expected-value based statistical inference. A naive
assumption of uniform prior is not valid in statistical mechanics.

(ERE) for a two-level system illuminated by a broadband light field, setting a
limit for their validity that depends on the light spectral properties (namely
on the height and width of its spectrum). Starting from the optical Bloch
equations for individual atoms, the ensemble averaged atomic inversion is shown
to follow ERE under two concurrent hypotheses: (i) the decorrelation of the
inversion at a given time from the field at later times, and (ii) a Markov
approximation owed to the short correlation time of the light field. The latter
is then relaxed, leading to effective Bloch equations for the ensemble average
in which the atomic polarization decay rate is increased by an amount equal to
the width of the light spectrum, what allows its adiabatic elimination for
large enough spectral width. Finally the use of a phase-diffusion model of
light allows us to check all the results and hypotheses through numerical
simulations of the corresponding stochastic differential equations.
