we show that this property pertains if the q-tuple is enlarged with independent

with disorder and confinement. Here we have examined how a change in porous
structure by preplating a monolayer of krypton affects the superfluid
properties of $^4$He adsorbed or confined in a nanoporous Gelsil glass, which
has a three-dimensional interconnected network of nanopores of 5.8 nm in
diameter. Isotherms of adsorption and desorption of nitrogen show that
monolayer preplating of Kr decreases the effective pore diameter to 4.7 nm and
broadens the pore size distribution by about eight times from the sharp
distribution of the bare Gelsil sample. The superfluid properties were studied
by a torsional oscillator for adsorbed film states and pressurized liquid
states, both before and after the monolayer Kr preplating. In the film states,
both the superfluid transition temperature $T_{\mathrm c}$ and the superfluid
density decrease about 10 percent by Kr preplating. The suppression of film
superfluidity is attributed to the quantum localization of $^4$He atoms by the
randomness in the substrate potential, which is caused by the
preplating--induced broadening of the pore size distribution. In the
pressurized liquid states, the superfluid density $\rho_{\mathrm s}$ is found
to increase by 10 percent by Kr preplating, whereas $T_{\mathrm c}$ is
decreased by 2 percent at all pressures. The unexpected enhancement of
$\rho_{\mathrm s}$ might indicate the existence of an unknown disorder effect
for confined $^4$He.

the conductivity of metallic surfaces in the clean system remains finite even

characterize spectral properties of the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of
theories with fermionic degrees of freedom beyond semiclassical approximation.
We obtain a general class of bosonic polynomial potentials for which the
Schr\""oedinger operator has a discrete spectrum. This class includes all the
scalar potentials in membrane, 5-brane, p-branes, multiple M2 branes, BLG and
ABJM theories. We also give a sufficient condition for discreteness of the
spectrum for supersymmmetric and non supersymmetric theories with a fermionic
contribution. We characterize then the spectral properties of different
theories: the BMN matrix model, the supermembrane with central charges and a
bound state of $N$ D2 with $m$ D0. We show that, while the first two models
have a purely discrete spectrum with finite multiplicity, the latter has a
continuous spectrum starting from a constant given in terms of the monopole
charge.

We establish a scaling relation between sizes of holes and the magnitude of the

sharp contrast with homogeneous superconductors, where all vortices are known
to be simple. The proof is based on $\Gamma$-convergence approach which is

stars with 6 nuclear-theory-based equations of state (EOSs) described by
piecewise polytropes. Our purpose is to explore the dependence of the dynamical
behavior of the binary neutron star merger and resulting gravitational
waveforms on the EOS of the supernuclear-density matter. The numerical results
show that the merger process and the first outcome are classified into three
types; (i) a black hole is promptly formed, (ii) a short-lived hypermassive
neutron star (HMNS) is formed, (iii) a long-lived HMNS is formed. The type of
the merger depends strongly on the EOS and on the total mass of the binaries.
For the EOS with which the maximum mass is larger than 2Msun, the lifetime of
the HMNS is longer than 10 ms for a total mass m_0=2.7Msun. A recent radio
observation suggests that the maximum mass of spherical neutron stars is M_max
\geq 1.97\pm 0.04Msun in one \sigma level. This fact and our results support
the possible existence of a HMNS soon after the onset of the merger for a
typical binary neutron star with m_0=2.7Msun. We also show that the torus mass
surrounding the remnant black hole is correlated with the type of the merger
process; the torus mass could be large, \geq 0.1Msun, in the case that a
long-lived HMNS is formed. We also show that gravitational waves carry
information of the merger process, the remnant, and the torus mass surrounding
a black hole.

bounded function in terms of few linear phases with large Fourier coefficients
plus a part that is pseudorandom with respect to linear phases. The
Goldreich-Levin algorithm can be viewed as an algorithmic analogue of such a
decomposition as it gives a way to efficiently find the linear phases
associated with large Fourier coefficients.
  In the study of ""quadratic Fourier analysis"", higher-degree analogues of such
decompositions have been developed in which the pseudorandomness property is
stronger but the structured part correspondingly weaker. For example, it has
previously been shown that it is possible to express a bounded function as a
sum of a few quadratic phases plus a part that is small in the $U^3$ norm,
defined by Gowers for the purpose of counting arithmetic progressions of length
4. We give a polynomial time algorithm for computing such a decomposition.
  A key part of the algorithm is a local self-correction procedure for
Reed-Muller codes of order 2 (over $\F_2^n$) for a function at distance
$1/2-\epsilon$ from a codeword. Given a function $f:\F_2^n \to \{-1,1\}$ at
fractional Hamming distance $1/2-\epsilon$ from a quadratic phase (which is a
codeword of Reed-Muller code of order 2), we give an algorithm that runs in
time polynomial in $n$ and finds a codeword at distance at most $1/2-\eta$ for
$\eta = \eta(\epsilon)$. This is an algorithmic analogue of Samorodnitsky's
result, which gave a tester for the above problem. To our knowledge, it
represents the first instance of a correction procedure for any class of codes,
beyond the list-decoding radius.
  In the process, we give algorithmic versions of results from additive
combinatorics used in Samorodnitsky's proof and a refined version of the

Especially, flavonoids, a kind of secondary metabolites, of plant species are
interesting examples. Since plant species are believed to have specific
flavonoids with respect to diverse environment, elucidation of design
principles of metabolite distributions across plant species is important to
understand metabolite diversity and plant evolution. In the previous work, we
found heterogeneous connectivity in metabolite distributions, and proposed a
simple model to explain a possible origin of heterogeneous connectivity. In
this paper, we show further structural properties in the metabolite
distribution among families inspired by analogy with plant-animal mutualistic
networks: nested structure and modular structure. An earlier model represents
that these structural properties in bipartite relationships are determined
based on traits of elements and external factors. However, we find that the
architecture of metabolite distributions is described by simple evolution
processes without trait-based mechanisms by comparison between our model and
the earlier model. Our model can better predict nested structure and modular

mass estimates for flux limited samples of quasars. We do this by comparing the
BH mass estimates to those derived by randomly reassigning the quasar
broad-line widths to different objects and re-calculating the BH mass. For 9000
BH masses derived from the H_beta line we find that the distributions of
original and randomized BH masses in the M_BH-redshift plane and the
M_BH-luminosity plane are formally identical. A 2D KS test does not find a
difference at >90% confidence. For the MgII line (32000 quasars) we do find
very significant differences between the randomized and original BH masses, but
the amplitude of the difference is still small. The difference for the CIV line
(14000 quasars) is 2-3sigma and again the amplitude of the difference is small.
Subdividing the data into redshift and luminosity bins we find that the median
absolute difference in BH mass between the original and randomized data is
0.025, 0.01 and 0.04 dex for H_beta, MgII and CIV respectively. The maximum
absolute difference is always <=0.1 dex. We investigate whether our results are
sensitive to corrections to MgII virial masses (e.g. Onken & Kollmeier 2008).
These corrections do not influence our results. Moreover, the mass residual -
Eddington ratio correlation discussed by Onken & Kollmeier is more directly
attributable to the slope of the relation between H_beta and MgII line width.
Our results imply that the measured quasar broad-line velocity widths provide
little extra information, after allowing for the mean velocity width. In this
case virial estimates are equivalent to M_BH L^alpha, with L/L_edd L^(1-alpha)
(with alpha~0.5). This leaves an unanswered question of why the accretion
efficiency changes with luminosity in just the right way to keep the mean
broad-line widths fixed as a function of luminosity. (abridged)

previous investigations in showing a general trend of increased CO abundances

regions. Observations taken over a few nights generally show very similar CO
distributions, but significant changes are apparent over longer periods. In
past studies it has been assumed that the CO latitudinal variation occurs near
35 km altitude, at which K-band sensitivity to CO is greatest. By modeling the
detailed spectrum of the excess CO at high latitudes we show that it occurs at
altitudes around 45 km, much higher than has previously been assumed, and that
there cannot be significant contribution from levels of 36 km or lower. We
suggest that this is most likely due to downwelling of CO-rich gas from the
upper atmosphere at these latitudes, with the CO being removed by around 40 km
through chemical processes such as the reaction with sulfur trioxide.

H-alpha and X-ray emission are prominent in singular, low-mass objects later
than spectral class M. These activity signatures are interpreted as being
caused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What
remains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can
produce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal
gas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud
particles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the
ambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field
coupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.
However, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.
  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate
collisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust
collisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone
are not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside
the cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas
phase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes. Cosmic
rays are likely to increase the global level of ionisation, but their influence
decreases if a strong, large scale magnetic field is present as on Brown
Dwarfs.
  We suggest that although thermal gas ionisation declines in objects across
the fully-convective boundary, dust charging by collisional processes can play
an important role in the lowest mass objects. The onset of atmospheric dust may
therefore correlate with the anomalous X-ray and radio emission in atmospheres
that are cool, but charged more than expected by pure thermal ionisation.

quadratic variation. The notion introduced here generalizes the classical one,
of M\'etivier and Pellaumail which is quite restrictive. We make use of the
notion of $\chi$-covariation which is a generalized notion of covariation for
processes with values in two Banach spaces $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$. $\chi$ refers
to a suitable subspace of the dual of the projective tensor product of $B_{1}$
and $B_{2}$. We investigate some $C^{1}$ type transformations for various
classes of stochastic processes admitting a $\chi$-quadratic variation and
related properties. If $\X^1$ and $\X^2$ admit a $\chi$-covariation, $F^i: B_i
\rightarrow \R$, $i = 1, 2$ are of class $C^1$ with some supplementary
assumptions then the covariation of the real processes $F^1(\X^1)$ and
$F^2(\X^2)$ exist. A detailed analysis will be devoted to the so-called window
processes. Let $X$ be a real continuous process; the $C([-\tau,0])$-valued
process $X(\cdot)$ defined by $X_t(y) = X_{t+y}$, where $y \in [-\tau,0]$, is
called {\it window} process. Special attention is given to transformations of
window processes associated with Dirichlet and weak Dirichlet processes. In
fact we aim to generalize the following properties valid for $B=\R$. If $\X=X$
is a real valued Dirichlet process and $F:B \rightarrow \R$ of class $C^{1}(B)$
then $F(\X)$ is still a Dirichlet process. If $\X=X$ is a weak Dirichlet
process with finite quadratic variation, and $F: C^{0,1}([0,T]\times B)$ is of
class $C^{0,1}$, then $[ F(t, \X_t) ] $ is a weak Dirichlet process. We specify
corresponding results when $B=C([-\tau,0])$ and $\X=X(\cdot)$. This will
consitute a significant Fukushima decomposition for functionals of windows of
(weak) Dirichlet processes. As applications, we give a new technique for
representing path-dependent random variables.

multidimensional theory of General Relativity.
  Vector fields in general relativity form a three-parametric variety. Our
consideration includes the fields with a nonzero covariant divergence.
Depending on the relations between the particular parameters and the symmetry
of a problem, the vector fields can be longitudinal and/or transverse,
ultrarelativistic (i.e. massless) or nonrelativistic (massive), and so on.
  The longitudinal and transverse vector fields are considered separately in
detail in the background of the de Sitter cosmological metric. In most cases
the field equations reduce to Bessel equations, and their temporal evolution is
analyzed analytically. The energy-momentum tensor of the most simple zero-mass
longitudinal vector fields enters the Einstein equations as an additive to the
cosmological constant. In this case the de Sitter metric is the exact solution
of the Einstein equations. Hence, the most simple zero-mass longitudinal vector
field pretends to be an adequate tool for macroscopic description of dark
energy as a source of the expansion of the Universe at a constant rate. The
zero-mass vector field does not vanish in the process of expansion. On the
contrary, massive fields vanish with time. Though their amplitude is falling
down, the massive fields make the expansion accelerated.
  The macroscopic analysis of vector fields in cosmology gives up the hope that
the major puzzle -- attraction between individual objects and expansion of the
Universe as a whole -- can be solved within the Einstein's theory of general
relativity.

with the star formation likely to have been triggered by the collision between
the two galaxies. We measure some key physical parameters in an integrated and
spatially resolved manner for the ring galaxy. Using observed B-I colours and
the H-alpha equivalent widths, we conclude that two stellar components (a young
and an old population) are required to simultaneously match both observed
quantities. We constrain the age range, light and mass fractions of the young
star formation in the ring, finding a modest age range, a light fraction of
less than a third, and a negligible (<1%) mass fraction. We postulate that the
redder colours observed in the SE corner of the ring galaxy could correspond to
the nuclear bulge of the original disk galaxy from which the ring was created,
consistent with the stellar mass in the SE quadrant being 30-50% of the total.
The ring appears to have been a typical disk galaxy prior to the encounter. The
ring shows electron densities consistent with typical values for star-forming
HII regions. The eastern half of the ring exhibits a metallicity a factor of ~2
higher than the western half. The ionisation parameter, measured across the

the octupole component of the WMAP ILC 7 map, by looking at a_3,1 and a_3,3,

remarkably strong cross-correlations between the phases of kinematic dipole and
ILC 7 octupole, in full agreement with previous results. We further test the
multipole range 2<l<100, by investigating the ratio between the l+m=even and
l+m=odd parts of power spectra. We compare the results to simulations of a
Gaussian random sky, and find significant departure from the statistically
isotropic and homogeneous case, for a very broad range of multipoles. We found
that for the most prominent peaks of our estimator, the phases of the
corresponding harmonics are coherent with phases of the octupole. We believe,
our test would be very useful for detections of various types of residuals of

spontaneous cell polarisation. It consists in a drift-diffusion equation set in
the half-space, with the coupling involving the trace value on the boundary. We
characterize the following behaviours in the one-dimensional case: solutions
are global if the mass is below the critical mass and they blow-up in finite
time above the critical mass. The higher-dimensional case is also discussed.
The results are reminiscent of the classical Keller-Segel system in double the
dimension. In addition, in the one-dimensional case we prove quantitative
convergence results using relative entropy techniques. This work is
complemented with a more realistic model that takes into account dynamical
exchange of molecular content at the boundary. In the one-dimensional case we
prove that blow-up is prevented. Furthermore, density converges towards a non
trivial stationary configuration.

influence of electron polaron effect and other mechanisms of mass-enhancement
(related to momentum dependence of the self-energies) on effective mass and
scattering times of light and heavy components in the clean case (electron -
electron scattering and no impurities). We find the tendency towards
phase-separation (towards negative partial compressibility of heavy particles)
in a 3D case for large mismatch between the densities of heavy and light bands
in a strong coupling limit. We also observe that for low temperatures and equal
densities the resistivity in a homogeneous state R(T) ~ T^2 - behaves in a
Fermi-liquid fashion both in 3D and 2D cases. For temperatures higher then
effective bandwidth for heavy electrons T > Wh* the coherent behavior of heavy
component is totally destroyed. The heavy particles move diffusively in the
surrounding of light particles. At the same time the light particles scatter on
the heavy ones as if on immobile (static) impurities. In this regime the heavy
component is marginal, while the light one is not. The resistivity goes on
saturation for T > Wh* in the 3D case. In 2D the resistivity has a maximum and
localization tail due to weak - localization corrections of Altshuler - Aronov
type. Such behavior of resistivity in 3D could be relevant for some
uranium-based heavy-fermion compounds like UNi2Al3 and in 2D for some other
mixed-valence compounds possibly including the layered manganites. We also

concerns the deepness of the antinucleon-nucleus optical potential. In this
work we study this task in the framework of the non-linear derivative (NLD)
model which describes consistently bulk properties of nuclear matter and Dirac
phenomenology of nucleon-nucleus interactions. We apply the NLD model to
antinucleon interactions in nuclear matter and find a strong decrease of the
vector and scalar self-energies in energy and density and thus a strong
suppression of the optical potential at zero momentum and, in particular, at
FAIR energies. This is in agreement with available empirical information and,
therefore, resolves the issue concerning the incompatibility of G-parity
arguments in relativistic mean-field (RMF) models. We conclude the relevance of
our results for the future activities at FAIR.

large-scale distributed online platforms like Google, Amazon or Facebook. Their
applicability results from the fact that most services of online platforms
access the stored data objects via their primary key. However, NoSQL systems do
not efficiently support services referring more than one data object, e.g. the
term-based search for data objects. To address this issue we propose our
architecture based on an inverted index on top of a NoSQL system. For queries
comprising more than one term, distributed indices yield a limited performance
in large distributed systems. We propose two extensions to cope with this
challenge. Firstly, we store index entries not only for single term but also
for a selected set of term combinations depending on their popularity derived
from a query history. Secondly, we additionally cache popular keys on gateway
nodes, which are a common concept in real-world systems, acting as interface
for services when accessing data objects in the back end. Our results show that
we can significantly reduces the bandwidth consumption for processing queries,
with an acceptable, marginal increase in the load of the gateway nodes.

that radiation pressure is clearly incapable of stopping dust from flowing into

lepton mixing matrix, namely, it has the QM-like parametrization, and assume
the tribimaximal mixing (TBM) pattern for the neutrino mixing matrix. The
deviation of the leptonic mixing matrix from the TBM one is then systematically
studied. While the deviation of the solar and atmospheric neutrino mixing
angles from the corresponding TBM values, i.e. $\sin^2\theta_{12}=1/3$ and
$\sin^2\theta_{23}=1/2$, is fairly small, we find a nonvanishing reactor mixing
angle given by $\sin\theta_{13}\approx \lambda/\sqrt{2}$ ($\lambda\approx 0.22$
being the Cabibbo angle). Specifically, we obtain $\theta_{13}\simeq
9.2^{\circ}$ and $\delta_{CP} \simeq \delta_{\rm QM} \simeq {\cal

where does causal order come from, and is it a necessary property of nature? We
address these questions from the standpoint of quantum mechanics in a new
framework for multipartite correlations which does not assume a pre-defined
global causal structure but only the validity of quantum mechanics locally. All
known situations that respect causal order, including space-like and time-like
separated experiments, are captured by this framework in a unified way.
Surprisingly, we find correlations that cannot be understood in terms of
definite causal order. These correlations violate a 'causal inequality' that is
satisfied by all space-like and time-like correlations. We further show that in
a classical limit causal order always arises, which suggests that space-time
may emerge from a more fundamental structure in a quantum-to-classical
transition.

This is due to a known peculiarity of highly tailed distributions, that they

renders under this lognormal assumption cosmological probes such as the

fundamentally limited once the field becomes non linear, for any parameter of

P\'{o}lya on d-dimensional lattices -- has potential as a measure for the
analysis of networks. We present an efficient method for finding return
probability distributions for connected undirected graphs. We argue that return
probability has the same discriminatory power as existing k-step measures -- in
particular, beta centrality (with negative beta), the graph-theoretical power
index (GPI), and subgraph centrality. We compare the running time of our
algorithm to beta centrality and subgraph centrality and find that it is
significantly faster. When return probability is used to measure the same
phenomena as beta centrality, it runs in linear time -- O(n+m), where n and m
are the number of nodes and edges, respectively -- which takes much less time
than either the matrix inversion or the sequence of matrix multiplications
required for calculating the exact or approximate forms of beta centrality,
respectively. We call this form of return probability the P\'{o}lya power index
(PPI). Computing subgraph centrality requires an expensive eigendecomposition
of the adjacency matrix; return probability runs in half the time of the
eigendecomposition on a 2000-node network. These performance improvements are
important because computationally efficient measures are necessary in order to
analyze large networks.

observations toward a nearby embedded cluster, Serpens South, using the ASTE 10
m telescope. Our CO ($J=3-2$) map reveals that many outflows are crowded in the
dense cluster-forming clump that can be recognized as a HCO$^+$ clump with a
size of $\sim$ 0.2 pc and mass of $\sim$ 80 M$_\odot$. The clump contains
several subfragments with sizes of $\sim$ 0.05 pc. By comparing the CO
($J=3-2$) map with the 1.1 mm dust continuum image taken by AzTEC on ASTE, we
find that the spatial extents of the outflow lobes are sometimes
anti-correlated with the distribution of the dense gas and some of the outflow
lobes apparently collide with the dense gas. The total outflow mass, momentum,
and energy are estimated at 0.6 $M_\odot$, 8 $M_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$, and 64
$M_\odot$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$, respectively. The energy injection rate due to the
outflows is comparable to the turbulence dissipation rate in the clump,
implying that the protostellar outflows can maintain the supersonic turbulence
in this region. The total outflow energy seems only about 10 percent the clump
gravitational energy. We conclude that the current outflow activity is not
enough to destroy the whole cluster-forming clump, and therefore star formation
is likely to continue for several or many local dynamical times.

note that in the latter case and in the case of the phase states generation the
output state is in the linear modes, which prevents its subsequent degradation

  junctions",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.84.043628",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a two-mode Bose Josephson junction the dynamics induced by a sudden quench
of the tunnel amplitude leads to the periodic formation of entangled states.
For instance, squeezed states are formed at short times and macroscopic
superpositions of phase states at later times. The two modes of the junction
can be viewed as the two arms of an interferometer; use of entangled states
allows to perform atom interferometry beyond the classical limit. Decoherence
due to the presence of noise degrades the quantum correlations between the
atoms, thus reducing phase sensitivity of the interferometer. We consider the
noise induced by stochastic fluctuations of the energies of the two modes of
the junction. We analyze its effect on squeezed states and macroscopic
superpositions and study quantitatively the amount of quantum correlations
which can be used to enhance the phase sensitivity with respect to the
classical limit. To this aim we compute the squeezing parameter and the quantum
Fisher information during the quenched dynamics. For moderate noise intensities
we show that these useful quantum correlations increase on time scales beyond
the squeezing regime. This suggests multicomponent superpositions as
interesting candidates for high-precision atom interferometry.

identifying a strong correlation between sentiments expressed online and CDC-

Simulations of infectious disease transmission show that if clusters of
negative vaccine sentiments lead to clusters of unprotected individuals, the
likelihood of disease outbreaks are greatly increased. Online social media
provide unprecedented access to data allowing for inexpensive and efficient
tools to identify target areas for intervention efforts and to evaluate their

blue stars. Further, we find ongoing star formation as traced by H alpha
emission in 10 of the 11 galaxies with H alpha imaging obtained to date. Taken

detailed dynamical analysis requires the completion of data acquisition, the

thoroughly analyze. We build on this connection along two main strands. First
of all, we exhibit a manifestly local bi-Hamiltonian structure of the

precise the relation between this canonical Frobenius structure and the one
that underlies the Gromov-Witten theory of the resolved conifold in the
equivariantly Calabi-Yau case; a key role is played by Dubrovin's notion of

spectroscopy in the optical spectral range (3700 - 6900 {\AA}), mapping their
physical-chemical properties, using both the direct method and appropriate
strong-line methods. We make a statistical analysis of the resulting
distributions and we compare them with the integrated properties of the
galaxies. Our results indicate that outer parts of the three galaxies are
placed on the ""AGN-zone"" of the [NII]/H{\alpha} vs. [OIII]/H{\beta} diagnostic
diagram most likely due to a high N/O combined with the excitation structure in
these regions. From the statistical analysis, it is assumed that a certain
property can be considered as spatially homogeneous (or uniform) if a normal
gaussian function fits its distribution in several regions of the galaxy.
Moreover, a disagreement between the integrated properties and the mean values
of the distribution usually appears when a gaussian does not fit the
corresponding distribution. We find that for Mrk 930, the uniformity is found
for all parameters, except for electron density and reddening. The rotation
curve together with the H{\alpha} map and UV images, reveal a perturbed
morphology and possible interacting processes. The N/O is found to be constant
in the three studied objects at spatial scales of the order of several kpc so
we conclude that the number of WR stars estimated from spectroscopy is not
sufficient to pollute the ISM and to produce the observed N/O excess in these

this paper, we make two contributions to the learning literature. First, we
introduce a new filtering method, the state-observation sampling (SOS) filter,
for general state-space models with intractable observation densities. Second,
we develop an indirect inference-based estimator for a large class of
incomplete-information economies. We demonstrate the good performance of these

temporal distribution of supernova remnants on the spectrum and chemical
composition of cosmic rays observed at Earth. The calculations are carried out
for different choices of the diffusion coefficient D(E) experienced by cosmic
rays during propagation in the Galaxy. In particular, at high energies we
assume that D(E)\sim E^{\delta}, with $\delta=1/3$ and $\delta=0.6$ being the
reference scenarios. The large scale distribution of supernova remnants in the
Galaxy is modeled following the distribution of pulsars, with and without
accounting for the spiral structure of the Galaxy. We find that the stochastic
fluctuations induced by the spatial and temporal distribution of supernovae,
together with the effect of spallation of nuclei, lead to mild but sensible
violations of the simple, leaky-box-inspired rule that the spectrum observed at
Earth is $N(E)\propto E^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=\gamma+\delta$, where $\gamma$
is the slope of the cosmic ray injection spectrum at the sources. Spallation of
nuclei, even with the small rates appropriate for He, may account for slight
differences in spectral slopes between different nuclei, providing a possible
explanation for the recent CREAM observations. For $\delta=1/3$ we find that
the slope of the proton and helium spectra are $\sim 2.67$ and $\sim 2.6$
respectively at energies above 1 TeV (to be compared with the measured values
of $2.66\pm 0.02$ and $2.58\pm 0.02$). For $\delta=0.6$ the hardening of the He
spectra is not observed. We also comment on the effect of time dependence of
the escape of cosmic rays from supernova remnants, and of a possible clustering
of the sources in superbubbles. In a second paper we will discuss the
implications of these different scenarios for the anisotropy of cosmic rays.

determine the contribution to anisotropy resulting from both the large scale

remnants. The naive expectation that the anisotropy amplitude scales as D(E) is
shown to be an oversimplification which does not reflect in the predicted
anisotropy for any realistic distribution of the sources. The fluctuations in
the anisotropy pattern are dominated by nearby sources, so that predicting or
explaining the observed anisotropy amplitude and phase becomes close to
impossible. We find however that the very weak energy dependence of the
anisotropy amplitude below $10^{5}$ GeV and the rise at higher energies, can
best be explained if the diffusion coefficient is $D(E)\sim E^{1/3}$. Faster
diffusion, for instance with $\delta=0.6$, leads in general to an exceedingly
large anisotropy amplitude. The spiral structure introduces interesting trends
in the energy dependence of the anisotropy pattern, which qualitatively reflect
the trend seen in the data. For large values of the halo size we find that the
anisotropy becomes dominated by the large scale regular structure of the source
distribution, leading indeed to a monotonic increase of $\delta_A$ with energy.

time flows at different rates in different regions of space-time. Therefore,
due to quantum complementarity the visibility will drop to the extent to which
the path information becomes available from reading out the proper time from

proportional to the total pressure. In this particular case, we find that the
parameters which dominate the limit-cycle properties are the mass-supply rate
and the value of the alpha-viscosity parameter. Although the duration of the
cycle (or the outburst) does not exhibit any clear dependence on the black hole
spin, the maximal outburst luminosity (in the Eddington units) is positively
correlated with the spin value. We suggest a simple method for a rough estimate
of the black hole spin based on the maximal luminosity and the ratio of
outburst to cycle durations. We also discuss a temperature-luminosity relation

new horizons in the study of the stellar parameters of giant stars, and
provided new important constraints for the atmospheric and evolutionary
models.We aim to determine which stellar parameters can be constrained by using
infrared interferometry and spectroscopy, in the case of C-stars what is the
precision which can be achieved and what are the limitations. For this purpose
we obtained new infrared spectra and combined them with unpublished
interferometric measurements for five mildly variable carbon-rich asymptotic
giant branch stars. The observations were compared with a large grid of
hydrostatic model atmospheres and with new isochrones which include the
predictions of the thermally pulsing phase. For the very first time we are able
to reproduce spectra in the range between 0.9 and 4 $\mu$m, and $K$ broad band
interferometry with hydrostatic model atmospheres. Temperature, mass, log$(g)$,
C/O and a reasonable range for the distance were derived for all the objects of
our study. All our targets have at least one combination of best-fitting
parameters which lays in the region of the HR-diagram where C-stars are
predicted. We confirm that low resolution spectroscopy is not sensitive to the
mass and log$(g)$ determination. For hydrostatic objects the $3\,\mu$m feature
is very sensitive to temperature variations therefore it is a very powerful
tool for accurate temperature determinations. Interferometry can constrain
mass, radius and log$(g)$ but a distance has to be assumed. The large
uncertainty in the distance measurements available for C-rich stars remains a
major problem.

recovery of sparse signals in noise. Specifically, we show that any sequential
measurement procedure fails provided the average number of measurements per
dimension grows slower then log s / D(f0||f1) where s is the level of sparsity,
and D(f0||f1) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the underlying
distributions. For comparison, we show any non-sequential procedure fails
provided the number of measurements grows at a rate less than log n /
D(f1||f0), where n is the total dimension of the problem. Lastly, we show that
a simple procedure termed sequential thresholding guarantees exact support
recovery provided the average number of measurements per dimension grows faster
than (log s + log log n) / D(f0||f1), a mere additive factor more than the
lower bound.

active quantum wells and metal gratings supporting surface plasmon polarition
resonances. Finite-difference time-domain simulations show that by matching the
surface plasmon polarition resonance with the active wavelength regime of the
quantum well a strong transmission enhancement is observed when illuminating
the sample with p-polarized radiation. This transmission enhancement is further
increased by taking advantage of the Fabry-Perot resonances of the structure.
