Abbe's diffraction limit, have emerged. To obtain a rough estimate of the
resolution of such superlenses, imaging of two subwavelength slits, separated
by a subwavelength gap \textit{d} is typically performed. The resolution
$\Delta$ of the lens corresponds to the minimum possible gap $d_{min}$ for
which a distinct image of the two slits can be resolved ($\Delta \sim
d_{min}$). In this letter, we present a more quantitative estimate of the
resolution of manufactured lenses by fitting analytical near-field image
profiles, obtained from imaging a two-slit object with a theoretical
negative-index lens of known resolution, to experimental data. We conclude the
discussion by applying our analytical method to 3 case examples of superlensing
from the literature. As shown, this method is particularly attractive for
rapidly assessing the performance of fabricated superresolution lenses.

  proceedings of the conference Quantum Field Theory and Gravity (Regensburg,
  2010)",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shape dynamics is a completely background-independent universal framework of
dynamical theories from which all absolute elements have been eliminated. For
particles, only the variables that describe the shapes of the instantaneous
particle configurations are dynamical. In the case of Riemannian
three-geometries, the only dynamical variables are the parts of the metric that
determine angles. The local scale factor plays no role. This leads to a
shape-dynamic theory of gravity in which the four-dimensional diffeomorphism
invariance of general relativity is replaced by three-dimensional
diffeomorphism invariance and three-dimensional conformal invariance. Despite
this difference of symmetry groups, it is remarkable that the predictions of
the two theories -- shape dynamics and general relativity -- agree on spacetime
foliations by hypersurfaces of constant mean extrinsic curvature. However, the
two theories are distinct, with shape dynamics having a much more restrictive
set of solutions. There are indications that the symmetry group of shape
dynamics makes it more amenable to quantization and thus to the creation of
quantum gravity. This introduction presents in simple terms the arguments for
shape dynamics, its implementation techniques, and a survey of existing
results.

calculate their properties. I suggest the reason is that existing theories stem
from the classical theory of ideal or simple gases in which (to a first
approximation) atoms do not interact. Even the law of mass action describes
reactants as if they were ideal. I propose that theories of ionic solutions
should start with the theory of complex fluids because that theory is designed
to deal with interactions from the beginning. The variational theory of complex
fluids is particularly well suited to describe mixtures like the solutions in
and outside biological cells. When a component or force is added to a solution,
the theory derives - by mathematics alone - a set of partial differential
equations that captures the resulting interactions self-consistently. Such a
theory has been implemented and shown to be computable in biologically relevant
systems but it has not yet been thoroughly tested in equilibrium or flow.

important constraint for microlensing, eclipsing binary, planetary transit, and
interferometric observations, but is generally treated as a parameterized
curve, such as a linear-plus-square-root law. Many analyses assume
limb-darkening coefficients computed from model stellar atmospheres. However,
previous studies, using I({\mu}) from plane- parallel models, have found that
fits to the flux-normalized curves pass through a fixed point, a common {\mu}
location on the stellar disk, for all values of T eff, log g and wavelength.
Aims. We study this fixed {\mu}-point to determine if it is a property of the
model stellar atmospheres or a property of the limb-darkening laws.
Furthermore, we use this limb-darkening law as a tool to probe properties of
stellar atmospheres for comparison to limb- darkening observations. Methods.
Intensities computed with plane-parallel and spherically-symmetric Atlas models
(characterized by the three fundamental parameters L\star, M\star and R\star)
are used to reexamine the existence of the fixed {\mu}-point for the
parametrized curves. Results. We find that the intensities from our spherical
models do not have a fixed point, although the curves do have a minimum spread
at a {\mu}-value similar to the parametrized curves. We also find that the
parametrized curves have two fixed points, {\mu}1 and {\mu}2, although {\mu}2
is so close to the edge of the disk that it is missed using plane-parallel
atmospheres. We also find that the spherically- symmetric models appear to
agree better with published microlensing observations relative to
plane-parallel models.

invariants like the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemann curvature. If the
metric becomes degenerate (as in singular semi-Riemannian geometry), these
constructions no longer work, because they are based on the inverse of the
metric, and on related operations like the contraction between covariant
indices. In this article we develop the geometry of singular semi-Riemannian
manifolds. First, we introduce an invariant and canonical contraction between
covariant indices, applicable even for degenerate metrics. This contraction
applies to a special type of tensor fields, which are radical-annihilator in
the contracted indices. Then, we use this contraction and the Koszul form to
define the covariant derivative for radical-annihilator indices of covariant
tensor fields, on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds named
radical-stationary. We use this covariant derivative to construct the Riemann
curvature, and show that on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds,
named semi-regular, the Riemann curvature is smooth. We apply these results to
construct a version of Einstein's tensor whose density of weight 2 remains
smooth even in the presence of semi-regular singularities. We can thus write a
densitized version of Einstein's equation, which is smooth, and which is
equivalent to the standard Einstein equation if the metric is non-degenerate.

neighbouring patches drives matter out of the surrounding voids, into walls and
filaments before it finally gets accreted onto virialised dark matter halos. As
these walls/filaments constitute the boundaries of asymmetric voids, they
acquire a net transverse motion, which explains the angular momentum rich

when applied to nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with
superlinearly growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift
coefficients. Classical Monte Carlo simulations do, however, not suffer from
this divergence behavior of Euler's method because this divergence behavior
happens on rare events. Indeed, for such nonlinear SDEs the classical Monte
Carlo Euler method has been shown to converge by exploiting that the Euler
approximations diverge only on events whose probabilities decay to zero very
rapidly. Significantly more efficient than the classical Monte Carlo Euler
method is the recently introduced multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method. The main
observation of this article is that this multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method
does - in contrast to classical Monte Carlo methods - not converge in general
in the case of such nonlinear SDEs. More precisely, we establish divergence of
the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method for a family of SDEs with superlinearly
growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficients. In
particular, the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method diverges for these
nonlinear SDEs on an event that is not at all rare but has probability one. As
a consequence for applications, we recommend not to use the multilevel Monte
Carlo Euler method for SDEs with superlinearly growing nonlinearities. Instead
we propose to combine the multilevel Monte Carlo method with a slightly
modified Euler method. More precisely, we show that the multilevel Monte Carlo
method combined with a tamed Euler method converges for nonlinear SDEs with
globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficients and preserves its
strikingly higher order convergence rate from the Lipschitz case.

symmetries. With the ordering of spins in a ferromagnet or the freezing of a

the disordered one. In contrast, topological states are distinguished by
specific \textit{topological} properties that are encoded in their quantum
mechanical wavefunctions. Frequently, a consequence of these properties is that
there are robust ""topologically protected"" states on the sample's boundaries.
The edge states of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) are the classic example. In
the last few years, it was realized that another class of such topological
matter may exist in 3D band insulators with large spin-orbit interaction. These
so-called topological insulators are predicted to host robust surface states,
which exhibit a number of interesting properties including spin helicity,
immunity to back-scattering, and weak \textit{anti}--localization. There are
predictions of a number of unusual phenomena associated with these surface
states, including a proximity-effect-induced exotic superconducting state with
Majorana fermions bound to a vortex and an `axion' electromagnetic response,
and proposals for applications, such as their use in terahertz devices. In this
Letter we report the observation of an unprecedentedly large rotation of the
polarization plane of linearly polarized light reflected from thin films of the

be as large as 65$^\circ$ and is due almost entirely to the surface states. Our

exchange.
  We begin by considering a directed graph G = (V, E) on the sensor nodes,
where the goal is to determine the optimal encoders on each edge which achieve
function computation at the collector node. Our goal is to characterize the
rate region in R^{|E|}, i.e., the set of points for which there exist feasible
encoders with given rates which achieve zero-error computation for
asymptotically large block length. We determine the solution for directed
trees, specifying the optimal encoder and decoder for each edge. For general
directed acyclic graphs, we provide an outer bound on the rate region by
finding the disambiguation requirements for each cut, and describe examples
where this outer bound is tight.
  Next, we address the scenario where nodes are connected in an undirected tree
network, and every node wishes to compute a given symmetric Boolean function of
the sensor data. Undirected edges permit interactive computation, and we
therefore study the effect of interaction on the aggregation and communication
strategies. We focus on sum-threshold functions, and determine the minimum
worst-case total number of bits to be exchanged on each edge. The optimal
strategy involves recursive in-network aggregation which is reminiscent of
message passing. In the case of general graphs, we present a cutset lower
bound, and an achievable scheme based on aggregation along trees. For complete
graphs, we prove that the complexity of this scheme is no more than twice that
of the optimal scheme.

model, matter and gauge superfields reside in the 5D bulk while a SUSY breaking
sector and the Higgs doublet superfields are localized on the infrared brane.
The Yukawa coupling hierarchy in SM can be naturally explained through the
wavefunction localization of the matter superfields. While sparticles obtain
their flavor-blind soft SUSY breaking masses dominantly from the
gaugino-mediated SUSY breaking, flavor-violating soft terms arise through the
gravity-mediated SUSY breaking which are controlled by the wavefunction
localization of the matter superfields. This structure of the model allows us
to predict the sparticle mass spectrum including flavor-violating terms. We
first explicitly determine the 5D disposition of matter superfields from the
low energy experimental data on SM fermion masses, CKM matrix and the neutrino
oscillation parameters. Then, we calculate particle mass spectra and estimate
the effects of the flavor-violating soft terms, which should be compared with
the current experimental constraints. With gravitino being the lightest
sparticle (LSP), the next-to-LSP, which is long-lived, is predicted most likely
to be either singlet smuon-like or selectron-like. The model can be tested at
collider experiments through flavor-violating processes involving sparticles.
The flavor structure among sparticle, once observed, gives us a clue to deep
understanding of the origin of Yukawa coupling hierarchy.

fundamental role in establishing the possibility of accretional collisions in
such extreme cases. The most important secular parameters are the forced
eccentricity and secular frequency, which depend on the initial conditions of
the particles, as well as on the mass and orbital parameters of the secondary
star. We construct a second-order theory (with respect to the masses) for the
planar secular motion of small planetasimals and deduce new expressions for the
forced eccentricity and secular frequency. We also reanalyze the radial
velocity data available for Gamma-Cephei and present a series of orbital
solutions leading to residuals compatible with the best fits. Finally, we
discuss how different orbital configurations for Gamma-Cephei may affect the
dynamics of small bodies in circunmstellar motion. For Gamma-Cephei, we find
that the classical first-order expressions for the secular frequency and forced
eccentricity lead to large inaccuracies around 50 % for semimajor axes larger
than one tenth the orbital separation between the stellar components. Low
eccentricities and/or masses reduce the importance of the second-order terms.
The dynamics of small planetesimals only show a weak dependence with the
orbital fits of the stellar components, and the same result is found including
the effects of a nonlinear gas drag. Thus, the possibility of planetary
formation in this binary system largely appears insensitive to the orbital fits
adopted for the stellar components, and any future alterations in the system
parameters (due to new observations) should not change this picture. Finally,
we show that planetesimals migrating because of gas drag may be trapped in
mean-motion resonances with the binary, even though the migration is divergent.

showing that they conflict with observation, and focused attention on a few

so strong that it completely cancels the field of the charge clouds at the

1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited ""bluer-when-brighter""
trends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to
88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation
unambiguously confirmed that the ""bluer-when-brighter"" trend is common in the
emission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation
component with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red
component. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to
exhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay
phases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color
correlation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively
weak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of
polarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and
PKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714. We also investigated the dependence
of the degree of variability on the luminosity and the synchrotron peak
frequency, \nu_peak. As a result, we found that lower luminosity and higher
\nu_peak objects had smaller variations in their amplitudes both in the flux,
color, and polarization degree. Our observation suggests the presence of
several distinct emitting sources, which have different variation time-scales,
colors, and polarizations. We propose that the energy injection by, for
example, internal shocks in relativistic shells is a major factor for blazar
variations on time scales of both days and months.

call such an object the Gravitationally Equivalent of an Atom (GEA). Mini black
holes are expected to lose mass through quantum evaporation, which has become
well accepted on purely theoretical grounds. Since all attempts to directly
observe x-rays from an evaporating black hole have failed, we examine the
possibility of the inverse test: search for extant mini black holes by looking
for emissions from matter bound in a GEA. If quantum evaporation does not
occur, then miniature black holes left over from the early universe may be
stable, contribute to dark matter, and in principle be detectable through
emissions associated with the bound matter. We show that small black holes-with
masses below \sim10^12 kg-can bind matter without readily absorbing it into the
black hole but the emissions are too weak to be detected from earth.

bifurcation (SBB), through which the asymmetric modes emerge from the symmetric

supercritical bifurcation if the nonlinearity is localized in relatively broad
domains around two central sites, and also in the ring of a small size, i.e.,
in effectively nonlocal settings. The family of antisymmetric modes does not
undergo bifurcations, and features both stable and unstable portions. The
evolution of unstable localized modes is investigated by means of direct

of the subcritical bifurcation, give rise to breathers oscillating between the

stars represent the extension of the well-known DZ sequence towards cooler
temperatures and fill the gap around Teff = 6500 K present in a previous study.
The metal abundances are similar to those in the hotter DZ, but the lowest

interpretation is complicated in terms of the accretion/diffusion scenario,
because we do not know if accretion is still occurring or has ended long ago.
Independent of that uncertainty, the masses of the metals currently present in

real networks and synthetic networks against random failures or intentional

measures to characterize the vitality of a vertex in maintaining the integrity
of the network but not the only one. Damage, the decrease of the largest
component size that was caused by the removal of a vertex, intuitively is a
more destructive guide for intentional attack on networks since the network
functionality is usually measured by the largest component size. However, it is
surprising to find that little is known about behaviors of real networks or
synthetic networks against intentional attack guided by damage (damage attack),
in which adversaries always choose the vertex with the largest damage to
attack.
  In this article, we dedicate our efforts to understanding damage attack and
behaviors of real networks as well as synthetic networks against this attack.
To this end, existing attacking models, statistical properties of damage in
complex networks are first revisited. Then, we present the empirical analysis
results about behaviors of complex networks against damage attack with the
comparisons to degree attack. It is surprising to find a cross-point for
diverse networks before which damage attack is more destructive than degree
attack. Further investigation shows that the existence of cross-point can be
attributed to the fact that: degree attack tends produce networks with more
heterogenous damage distribution than damage attack. Results in this article
strongly suggest that damage attack is one of most destructive attacks and
deserves our research efforts.Our understandings about damage attack may also
shed light on efficient solutions to protect real networks against damage
attack.

Specifically, combining pixel timing information with an improved direction
reconstruction algorithm, leads to improvements in angular and core resolution
as large as ~40% and ~30%, respectively, when compared with the same algorithm
without the use of timing. Above 10 TeV, this results in an angular resolution
approaching 0.05 degrees, together with a core resolution better than ~15 m.
The off-axis post-cut gamma-ray acceptance is energy dependent and its full
width at half maximum ranges from 4 degrees to 8 degrees. For shower directions
that are up to ~6 degrees off-axis, the angular resolution achieved by using
timing information is comparable, around 100 TeV, to the on-axis angular
resolution. The telescope specifications and layout we describe here are geared
towards energies above 10 TeV. However, the methods can in principle be applied
to other energies, given suitable telescope parameters. The 5-telescope cell
investigated in this study could initially pave the way for a larger array of
sparsely spaced telescopes in an effort to push the collection area to >10 km2.

  determination using stellar chronology with white dwarfs in wide binaries","10 pages, 8 figures, Accepted by A\&A 2011 March 30",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201116775",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stellar ages are extremely difficult to determine and often subject to large
uncertainties, especially for field low-mass stars. We plan to carry out a
calibration of the decrease in high-energy emissions of low-mass GKM stars with
time, and therefore precise age determination is a key ingredient. The overall
goal of our research is to study the time evolution of these high-energy
emissions as an essential input to studing exoplanetary atmospheres.
  We propose to determine stellar ages with a methodology based on wide
binaries. We are interested in systems composed of a low-mass star and a white
dwarf (WD), where the latter serves as a stellar chronometer for the system. We
aim at obtaining reliable ages for a sample of late-type stars older than 1
Gyr.
  We selected a sample of wide binaries composed by a DA type WD and a GKM
companion. High signal-to-noise, low-resolution spectroscopic observations were
obtained for most of the WD members of the sample. Atmospheric parameters were
determined by fitting the spectroscopic data to appropiate WD models. The total
ages of the systems were derived by using cooling sequences, an initial-final
mass relationship and evolutionary tracks, to account for the progenitor life.
  The spectroscopic observations have allowed us to determine ages for the
binary systems using WDs as cosmochronometers. We obtained reliable ages for 27
stars between 1 and 5 Gyr, which is a range where age determination becomes
difficult for field objects.

useful knowledge representation paradigm. They have recently been used to
complement the expressive power of Description Logics (DLs), leading to the
study of integrative formal frameworks, generally referred to as hybrid
knowledge bases, where both DL axioms and rules can be used to represent
knowledge. The need to use these hybrid knowledge bases in dynamic domains has
called for the development of update operators, which, given the substantially
different way Description Logics and rules are usually updated, has turned out
to be an extremely difficult task.
  In [SL10], a first step towards addressing this problem was taken, and an
update operator for hybrid knowledge bases was proposed. Despite its
significance -- not only for being the first update operator for hybrid
knowledge bases in the literature, but also because it has some applications -
this operator was defined for a restricted class of problems where only the
ABox was allowed to change, which considerably diminished its applicability.
Many applications that use hybrid knowledge bases in dynamic scenarios require
both DL axioms and rules to be updated.
  In this paper, motivated by real world applications, we introduce an update
operator for a large class of hybrid knowledge bases where both the DL
component as well as the rule component are allowed to dynamically change. We
introduce splitting sequences and splitting theorem for hybrid knowledge bases,
use them to define a modular update semantics, investigate its basic
properties, and illustrate its use on a realistic example about cargo imports.

avoids light absorption in the substrate and therefore associated thermal
problems, and even allows the use of opaque materials with possibly favourable
mechanical and thermal properties. Recently, the all-reflective coupling of two
cavities with a low-efficiency 3-port diffraction grating was theoretically
investigated. Such a grating has an additional (a third) port. However, it was
shown that the additional port does not necessarily decrease the bandwidth of
the coupled cavities. Such an all-reflective scheme for cavity coupling is of
interest in the field of gravitational wave detection. In such detectors light
that is resonantly enhanced inside the so-called power-recycling cavity is
coupled to (kilometre-scale) Fabry-Perot resonators representing the arms of a
Michelson interferometer. In order to achieve a high sensitivity over a broad
spectrum, the Fabry-Perot resonators need to have a high bandwidth for a given
(high) power build-up. We realized such an all-reflective coupling in a

therefore encourage the application of all-reflective cavity couplers in future

${\bf H}^n$ denotes the product of $n$ upper half-planes, $H^2$, equipped with
the co-compact action of $\Gamma \subset SL(2, {\mathbb R})^n$) and $({\bf
H}^n)^*/\Gamma$ (where $(H^2)^* = H^2\cup \{{\rm cusp\,\, of}\,\,\Gamma\}$ and
$\Gamma$ is a congruence subgroup of $SL(2, {\mathbb R})^n$). The cohomology
groups of the Hilbert variety, which inherit a Hodge structure (in the sense of
Deligne), are analyzed, as well as bifiltered sequences, weight and Hodge
filtrations, and it is argued that the torsion part of the cuspidal cohomology
is involved in the global anomaly condition. Indeed, in presence of the
cuspidal part, all cohomology classes can be mapped to the boundary of the
space and the cuspidal contribution can be involved in the global anomaly
condition.

quantization rules look like for the RI formulation of mechanics. We point out
that in this case some of the rules acquire an intuitively clearer form. Hence
the formulation could be an alternative starting point for teaching the basic
principles of quantum mechanics. The advantages can be resumed as follows. a)
In RI formulation both the temporal and the spatial coordinates are subject to
quantization. b) The canonical Hamiltonian of RI formulation is proportional to
the quantity $\tilde H=p_t+H$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the initial
formulation. Due to the reparametrization invariance, the quantity $\tilde H$
vanishes for any solution, $\tilde H=0$. So the corresponding
quantum-mechanical operator annihilates the wave function, $\hat{\tilde
H}\Psi=0$, which is precisely the Schr\""odinger equation
$i\hbar\partial_t\Psi=\hat H\Psi$. As an illustration, we discuss quantum
mechanics of the relativistic particle.

as a function of time, both by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) measurements of
paper samples and by numerical simulations of a crystal plasticity or discrete
dislocation dynamics model. This model has a jamming or yielding phase
transition, around which power-law or Andrade creep is found. During primary
creep, the relative strength of the strain rate fluctuations increases with
time in both cases - the spatially averaged creep rate obeys the Andrade law
$\epsilon_t \sim t^{-0.7}$, while the time dependence of the spatial
fluctuations of the local creep rates is given by $\Delta \epsilon_t \sim
t^{-0.5}$. A similar scaling for the fluctuations is found in the logarithmic
creep regime that is typically observed for lower applied stresses. We review
briefly some classical theories of Andrade creep from the point of view of such
spatial fluctuations. We consider these phenomenological, time-dependent creep
laws in terms of a description based on a non-equilibrium phase transition
separating evolving and frozen states of the system when the externally applied
load is varied. Such an interpretation is discussed further by the data
collapse of the local deformations in the spirit of absorbing state/depinning
phase transitions, as well as deformation-deformation correlations and the
width of the cumulative strain distributions. The results are also compared
with the order parameter fluctuations observed close to the depinning
transition of the 2$d$ Linear Interface Model or the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson
equation.

environment, including the dust production rate and its variations along its
preperihelion orbit. The comet was observed during its approach to the Sun on
four epochs between early-June 2008 and mid-January 2009, over a large range of
heliocentric distances that will be covered by the mission in 2014. An
anomalous enhancement of the coma dust density was measured towards the comet
nucleus. The scalelength of this enhancement increased with decreasing
heliocentric distance of the comet. This is interpreted as a result of an
unusually slow expansion of the dust coma. Assuming a spherical symmetric coma,
the average amount of dust as well as its ejection velocity have been derived.
The latter increases exponentially with decreasing heliocentric distance (\rh),
ranging from about 1 m/s at 3 AU to about 25-35 m/s at 1.4 AU. Based on these

fundamental step toward the implementation of a quantum information processor.
In nano-devices this operation is counteracted by the solid-state environment,
characterized by a broadband and non-monotonic power spectrum, often 1/f at low
frequencies. For single-qubit gates, incoherent processes due to fluctuations
acting on different time scales result in peculiar short- and long-time

decoherence times, T1 and T2, simply related to the symmetry of the

low frequencies is instead responsible for defocusing processes and algebraic
short-time behavior. In this paper, we identify the relevant decoherence times
of an entangling operation due to the different decoherence channels
originating from solid-state noise. Entanglement is quantified by concurrence,
which we evaluate in an analytic form employing a multi-stage approach. The
'optimal' operating conditions of reduced sensitivity to noise sources are
identified. We apply this analysis to a superconducting \sqrt{i-SWAP} gate for

(radio) simultaneous multiwavelength study of the microquasar Cygnus X-1, which
aimed at an investigation of the origin of its mid-infrared emission. Compact
jets were present in two out of three observations, and we show that they
strongly contribute to the mid-infrared continuum. During the first
observation, we detect the spectral break - where the transition from the
optically thick to the optically thin regime takes place - at about 2.9e13 Hz.
We then show that the jet's optically thin synchrotron emission accounts for
the Cygnus X-1's emission beyond 400 keV, although it cannot alone explain its
3-200 keV continuum. A compact jet was also present during the second
observation, but we do not detect the break, since it has likely shifted to
higher frequencies. In contrast, the compact jet was absent during the last
observation, and we show that the 5-30 micron mid-infrared continuum of Cygnus
X-1 stems from the blue supergiant companion star HD 226868. Indeed, the
emission can then be understood as the combination of the photospheric
Raleigh-Jeans tail and the bremsstrahlung from the expanding stellar wind.
Moreover, the stellar wind is found to be clumpy, with a filling factor f
{\infty}~0.09-0.10. Its bremsstrahlung emission is likely anti-correlated to
the soft X-ray emission, suggesting an anti-correlation between the mass-loss
and mass-accretion rates. Nevertheless, we do not detect any mid-infared
spectroscopic evidence of interaction between the jets and the Cygnus X-1's

worldwide clock comparisons will require also an improvement of the local
signal distribution systems. For example, the future ACES (atomic clock
ensemble in space) mission shall demonstrate remote time scale comparisons at
the uncertainty level of 100 ps. To ensure that the ACES ground instrument will
be synchronized to the local time scale at PTB without a significant
uncertainty contribution, we have developed a means for calibrated clock
comparisons through optical fibers. An uncertainty below 50 ps over a distance
of 2 km has been demonstrated on the campus of PTB. This technology is thus in
general a promising candidate for synchronization of enhanced time transfer
equipment with the local realizations of UTC . Based on these experiments we
estimate the uncertainty level for calibrated time transfer through optical

that do not display a spread in metallicity. Unusual features of their CMD can
be interpreted in terms of differences in the Helium content of the stars
belonging to the sub-populations. Differences in He abundance have never been
directly observed. We attempt to measure these differences in two giant stars
of NGC 2808 with very similar parameters but different Na and O abundances,
hence that presumably belong to different sub-populations, by directly
comparing their He I 10830 {\AA} lines. The He 10830 {\AA} line forms in the
upper chromosphere. Our detailed models derive the chromospheric structure
using the Ca II and H$\alpha$, and simulate the corresponding He I 10830 line
profiles. We show that, at a given value of He abundance, the He I 10830
equivalent width cannot significantly change without a corresponding much
larger change in the Ca II lines. We have used the VLT-CRIRES to obtain
high-resolution spectra in the 10830 {\AA} region, and the VLT-UVES to obtain
spectra of the Ca II and H$\alpha$ lines of our target stars. The two target
stars have very similar Ca II and H$\alpha$ lines, but different appearances in
the He region. One line, blueshifted by 17 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the He
10830 rest wavelength, is detected in the spectrum of the Na-rich star, whereas
the Na-poor star spectrum is consistent with a non-detection. The difference in
the spectra is consistent and most closely explained by an He abundance
difference between the two stars of $\Delta Y \ge$ 0.17.We provide direct
evidence of a significant He line strength difference in giant stars of NGC
2808 belonging to different sub-populations, which had been previously detected
by other photometric and spectroscopic means.

inference takes into account the multivariate information between voxels and is
currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitive information is
encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However,
it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of
dimensionality, since there are far more features than samples, i.e., more
voxels than fMRI volumes. To address this problem, different methods have been
proposed, such as, among others, univariate feature selection, feature
agglomeration and regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider a
sparse hierarchical structured regularization. Specifically, the penalization
we use is constructed from a tree that is obtained by spatially-constrained
agglomerative clustering. This approach encodes the spatial structure of the
data at different scales into the regularization, which makes the overall
prediction procedure more robust to inter-subject variability. The
regularization used induces the selection of spatially coherent predictive
brain regions simultaneously at different scales. We test our algorithm on real

restrict the phase of $\kappa_{tcR}^{\gamma}$, and the combined bound results
in the upper limit, $\mathcal B(t\to c\gamma)<0.21%$, which is lower than the
CDF result. For real $\kappa_{tcR}^{\gamma}$, the upper bound on $\mathcal

obtaining slow-roll inflation with the required number of 60 e-foldings along
with non-trivial non-Gaussianities and gravitational waves. For studying
cosmology and phenomenology within a single string compactification scheme, we
provide a geometric resolution to a long-standing tension between LVS cosmology
and LVS phenomenology after incorporating the effect of a single mobile
spacetime-flling D3-brane and stacks of fluxed D7-branes wrapping the ""big""

for the Swiss-Cheese CY, we calculate geometric Kaehler potential in LVS limit
which are subdominant as compared to the tree level and (non-) perturbative
contributions. The issues in string phenomenology which has been addressed in
this review article, include realizing order one YM couplings, obtaining O(TeV)
gravitino and explicit calculation of various soft masses and couplings along
with the possibility of realizing fermionic mass scales of first two
generations, order eV neutrino mass scale and an estimate of the proton

stabilization via inclusion of fluxes in the same type IIB compactification
scheme. These issues include the existence of area codes, `inverse-problem'
related to non-supersymmetric black hole attractors and existence of fake

mono-metallic globular clusters the presence of the sodium versus oxygen
anticorrelation, within each subset of stars with iron content in the range
-1.9<~[Fe/H]<~-1.3. These findings suggest that, while the second generation
formation history in omega Cen is more complex than that of mono-metallic
clusters, it shares some key steps with those simpler cluster. In addition, the
giants in the range -1.3<[Fe/H]<~-0.7 show a direct O--Na correlation, at
moderately low O, but Na up to 20 times solar. These peculiar Na abundances are
not shared by stars in other environments often assumed to undergo a similar
chemical evolution, such as in the field of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These
O and Na abundances match well the yields of the massive asymptotic giant
branch stars (AGB) in the same range of metallicity, suggesting that the stars
at [Fe/H]>-1.3 in omega Cen are likely to have formed directly from the pure
ejecta of massive AGBs of the same metallicities. This is possible if the
massive AGBs of [Fe/H]>-1.3 in the progenitor system evolve when all the
pristine gas surrounding the cluster has been exhausted by the previous star
formation events, or the proto--cluster interaction with the Galaxy caused the
loss of a significant fraction of its mass, or of its dark matter halo, and the
supernova ejecta have been able to clear the gas out of the system. The absence
of dilution in the metal richer populations lends further support to a scenario
of the formation of second generation stars in cooling flows from massive AGB
progenitors. We suggest that the entire formation of omega Cen took place in a
few 10^8yr, and discuss the problem of a prompt formation of s--process
elements.

  objects with the IBIS gamma ray telescope","To appear in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201116516",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first detection of a gamma ray line with an energy of about 500 keV from
the center our Galaxy dates back to the early seventies. Thanks to the
astrophysical application of high spectral resolution detectors, it was soon
clear that this radiation was due to the 511 keV photons generated by
electron-positron annihilation. Even though the physical process are known, the
astrophysical origin of this radiation is still a mystery. The spectrometer SPI
aboard the INTEGRAL gamma-ray satellite has been used to produce the first
all-sky map in light of the 511 keV annihilation, but no direct evidence for
511 keV galactic compact objects has been found [...] We present the first deep
IBIS 511 keV all-sky map, obtained by applying standard analysis to about 5
years of data. Possible 511 keV signals are also searched over hour-day-month
timescales. The IBIS sensitivity at 511 keV depends on the detector quantum
efficiency at this energy and on the background. Both these quantities were
estimated in this work. We find no evidence of Galactic 511 keV point sources.
With an exposure of 10 Ms in the center of the Galaxy, we estimate a $1.6
\times 10^{-4}\,ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ flux 2 sigma upper limit. A similar limit
is given in a wide area in the Galactic center region with similar exposures.
The IBIS 511 keV flux upper limits for microquasars and supernova remnants
detected in the hard X domain ($E > 20\, keV$) are also reported. Our results
are consistent with a diffuse $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation scenario. If positrons
are generated in compact objects, we expect that a significant fraction of them
propagate in the interstellar medium before there are annihilated away from
their birth places.

binary compact object mergers and the associated gravitational wave emission.
Our analysis is based on general-relativistic simulations, in the spatial
conformal flatness approximation, using smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics for the
evolution of matter, and we use a set of equal and unequal mass models,
described by two nonzero-temperature hadronic equations of state and by one
strange star equation of state. Through Fourier transforms of the evolution of
matter variables, we can identify a number of oscillation modes, as well as
several nonlinear components (combination frequencies). We focus on the
dominant m=2 mode, which forms a triplet with two nonlinear components that are
the result of coupling to the quasiradial mode. A corresponding triplet of
frequencies is identified in the gravitational wave spectrum, when the
individual masses of the compact objects are in the most likely range of 1.2 to
1.35 $M_\odot$. We can thus associate, through direct analysis of the dynamics
of the fluid, a specific frequency peak in the gravitational wave spectrum with
the nonlinear component resulting from the difference between the m=2 mode and
the quasiradial mode. Once such observations become available, both the m=2 and
quasiradial mode frequencies could be extracted, allowing for the application
of gravitational-wave asteroseismology to the post-merger remnant and leading
to tight constraints on the equation of state of high-density matter.
