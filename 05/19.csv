measure for the statistics of random fields. When used in Bayesian parameter
estimation, their likelihood function is usually replaced by a Gaussian
approximation. However, this has been shown to be insufficient.
  Aims: For the case of Gaussian random fields, we search for an exact
probability distribution of correlation functions, which could improve the
accuracy of future data analyses.
  Methods: We use a fully analytic approach, first expanding the random field
in its Fourier modes, and then calculating the characteristic function.
Finally, we derive the probability distribution function using integration by
residues. We use a numerical implementation of the full analytic formula to
discuss the behaviour of this function.
  Results: We derive the univariate and bivariate probability distribution
function of the correlation functions of a Gaussian random field, and outline
how higher joint distributions could be calculated. We give the results in the
form of mode expansions, but in one special case we also find a closed-form
expression. We calculate the moments of the distribution and, in the univariate
case, we discuss the Edgeworth expansion approximation. We also comment on the
difficulties in a fast and exact numerical implementation of our results, and
on possible future applications.

spatial motion of the atom inside the cavity in the resonant case leads to a
transition between topologically different solutions. This effect is manifested
by a singularity in the inter-level transition spectrum. In the non-resonant

state information (CSIT) to maintain orthogonality between the users. Such
techniques have proven quite fragile in time-varying channels because the CSIT
is inherently imperfect due to estimation and feedback delay, as well
quantization noise. An alternative approach recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and
Tse (MAT) allows for significant multiplexing gain in the multi-input
single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) even with transmit CSIT that is
completely stale, i.e. uncorrelated with the current channel state. With $K$
users, their scheme claims to lose only a $\log(K)$ factor relative to the full
$K$ degrees of freedom (DoF) attainable in the MISO BC with perfect CSIT for
large $K$. However, their result does not consider the cost of the feedback,
which is potentially very large in high mobility (short channel coherence
time). In this paper, we more closely examine the MAT scheme and compare its
DoF gain to single user transmission (which always achieves 1 DoF) and partial
CSIT linear precoding (which achieves up to $K$). In particular, assuming the
channel coherence time is $N$ symbol periods and the feedback delay is $N_{\rm
fd}$ we show that when $N < (1+o(1)) K \log K$ (short coherence time), single
user transmission performs best, whereas for $N> (1+o(1)) (N_{\rm fd}+ K / \log
K)(1-\log^{-1}K)^{-1}$ (long coherence time), zero-forcing precoding
outperforms the other two. The MAT scheme is optimal for intermediate coherence
times, which for practical parameter choices is indeed quite a large and
significant range, even accounting for the feedback cost.

on a sample of 214 red giant branch, 31 red clump/horizontal branch, and 74

previous sample of only giant stars. We find that the thick disk [alpha/Fe]
ratios are enhanced, and have little variation (<0.1 dex), in agreement with
our previous study. The augmented sample further allows, for the first time,
investigation of the gradients in the metal-poor thick disk. For stars with
[Fe/H] < -1.2, the thick disk shows very small gradients, <0.03 +/- 0.02
dex/kpc, in alpha-enhancement, while we find a +0.01 +/- 0.04 dex/kpc radial

contributing little. Our results thus disfavor direct accretion of stars from
dwarf galaxies into the thick disk as a major contributor to the thick disk

pre-existing thin stellar disk by a minor merger, or efficient radial migration

A=B, C=0 (and permutations) are again the first flows that result in dynamo
with a decreased onset. (b) The most symmetric flow A=B=C is the second type of
flow that results in dynamo. It is and remains a local maximum. (c) At larger
Rm the flow A=B=2C/5 (and permutations) appears as the third type of flow that
results in dynamo. As Rm is increased it becomes the flow with the largest
growth rate. The growth rates appear to have some correlation with the Lyaponov
exponents but constructive re-folding of the field lines appears equally
important in determining the fasted dynamo flow.

precision such that problems far beyond the scale of the present Standard Model
of particle physics become accessible to experimental investigation. Due to the
close links between particle physics and cosmology, these studies also permit a
deep look into the very first instances of our universe. First addressed in
this article, both in theory and experiment, is the problem of baryogenesis ...
The question how baryogenesis could have happened is open to experimental
tests, and it turns out that this problem can be curbed by the very stringent
limits on an electric dipole moment of the neutron, a quantity that also has
deep implications for particle physics. Then we discuss the recent spectacular
observation of neutron quantization in the earth's gravitational field and of
resonance transitions between such gravitational energy states. These
measurements, together with new evaluations of neutron scattering data, set new
constraints on deviations from Newton's gravitational law at the picometer
scale. Such deviations are predicted in modern theories with extra-dimensions
that propose unification of the Planck scale with the scale of the Standard
Model ... Another main topic is the weak-interaction parameters in various
fields of physics and astrophysics that must all be derived from measured
neutron decay data. Up to now, about 10 different neutron decay observables
have been measured, much more than needed in the electroweak Standard Model.
This allows various precise tests for new physics beyond the Standard Model,
competing with or surpassing similar tests at high-energy. The review ends with
a discussion of neutron and nuclear data required in the synthesis of the
elements during the ""first three minutes"" and later on in stellar
nucleosynthesis.

many Hubble depths. The novel finding is a clear drop in the average scattering

average trend <M> computed in paper IX. Other correlations of the M scattering

make it possible to extrapolate the SNe Ia absolute magnitude M0 at a central
redshift z0=0, with M0=-17.9+-0.1 and a few final ECM solutions of the SNe Ia

paper, we extend this analysis by considering the quantisation of additional
bosonic fields necessary to obtain a complete SUSY multiplet next to graviton
and gravitino in various dimensions. As a generic example, we study concretely
the quantisation of the 3-index photon of 11d SUGRA, but our methods easily
extend to more general p-form fields. Due to the presence of a Chern-Simons
term for the 3-index photon, which is due to local SUSY, the theory is
self-interacting and its quantisation far from straightforward. Nevertheless,
we show that a reduced phase space quantisation with respect to the 3-index
photon Gauss constraint is possible. Specifically, the Weyl algebra of
observables, which deviates from the usual CCR Weyl algebras by an interesting
twist contribution proportional to the level of the Chern-Simons theory, admits
a background independent state of the Narnhofer-Thirring type.

easily, because of a virus that immediately after sending all the content of

the capability of using short-range communication technology like blue-tooth or
Wi-Fi, where nodes are carried by mobile users, and where links appear and
disappear according to the social relationships between the users. Our idea is
to use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal
smart-phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the legitimate owner of the

that works very well when the adversary is an insider, a malicious node in the
network that is part, or not very far, from the social community of the
original device that has been cloned. Community Certificates work very well
when the adversary is an outsider, a node that has the goal of using the stolen
credentials when interacting with other nodes that are far in the social
network from the original device. When combined, these mechanisms provide an
excellent protection against this very strong attack. We prove our ideas and

II and IX, the standard method of defining the curvature through closed
holonomies is not admissible. Instead, one has to implement the quantum
constraints by approximating the connection via open holonomies. In the case of
flat k=0 FRW and Bianchi I models, these two quantization methods coincide, but
in the case of the closed $k$=1 FRW model they might yield different quantum
theories. In this manuscript we explore these two quantizations and the
different effective descriptions they provide of the bouncing cyclic universe.
In particular, as we show in detail, the most dramatic difference is that in
the theory defined by the new quantization method, there is not one, but two
different bounces through which the cyclic universe alternates. We show that
for a `large' universe, these two bounces are very similar and, therefore,
practically indistinguishable, approaching the dynamics of the holonomy based

areas as diverse as ecosystem management, emergency response, and cell
reprogramming. A fundamental property of networks is that the perturbation of
one node can affect other nodes, in a process that may cause the entire or
substantial part of the system to change behavior and possibly collapse. Recent
research in metabolic and food-web networks has demonstrated the concept that
network damage caused by external perturbations can often be mitigated or
reversed by the application of compensatory perturbations. Compensatory
perturbations are constrained to be physically admissible and amenable to
implementation on the network. However, the systematic identification of
compensatory perturbations that conform to these constraints remains an open
problem. Here, we present a method to construct compensatory perturbations that
can control the fate of general networks under such constraints. Our approach
accounts for the full nonlinear behavior of real complex networks and can bring
the system to a desirable target state even when this state is not directly
accessible. Applications to genetic networks show that compensatory
perturbations are effective even when limited to a small fraction of all nodes
in the network and that they are far more effective when limited to the
highest-degree nodes. The approach is conceptually simple and computationally
efficient, making it suitable for the rescue, control, and reprogramming of
large complex networks in various domains.

Newly-formed stars tend to be concentrated along the central axis of the cloud

parameters, the time, $t_{_\star}$, at which star formation starts is
proportional to $\Phi_{_{\rm LyC}}^{-1/3}$. The pattern of star formation found

inaccurately handled with standard time integration schemes, leading to poor

first time that, in the absence of radiative cooling, concordance of thermal
and kinetic feedback are achieved when using an accurate time integration. In
order to preserve the concordance of feedback methods when using a more
efficient time integration scheme - as for instance the hierarchical time-step
scheme - we implement a modified version of the time-step limiter proposed by
Saitoh & Makino (2009). We apply the limiter to general test cases, and first
show that this scheme violates energy conservation up to almost four orders of
magnitude when energy is injected at random times. To tackle this issue, we
find necessary, not only to ensure a fast information propagation, but also to
enforce a prompt response of the system to the energy perturbation. The method
proposed here to handle strong feedback events enables us to achieve energy
conservation at percent level in all tests, even if all the available energy is
injected into only one particle. We argue that concordance of feedback methods
can be achieved in numerical simulations only if the time integration scheme
preserve a high energy conservation level.

Milky Way mass galaxies at the present-day have a bright LBG progenitor in the
redshift range 3<z<4, while 95% have a faint LBG progenitor in the same
redshift range, and 7% have a faint LBG progenitor at 10<z<11. With our
multiwavelength model, we also investigate the overlap between the LBG
population and that of submillimetre selected galaxies (SMGs); at z=3, only ~1%
of bright LBGs are also predicted to also be bright SMGs (with an 850 mum flux

and dark matter, recently shown to arise generically at high redshift, on
baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at low redshift. The amplitude
of the relative velocity effect at low redshift is model-dependent, but can be
parameterized by using an unknown bias. We find that if unaccounted, the
relative velocity effect can shift the BAO peak position and bias estimates of
the dark energy equation-of-state due to its non-smooth, out-of-phase
oscillation structure around the BAO scale. Fortunately, the relative velocity
effect can be easily modeled in constraining cosmological parameters without
substantially inflating the error budget. We also demonstrate that the presence
of the relative velocity effect gives rise to a unique signature in the galaxy
bispectrum, which can be utilized to isolate this effect. Future dark energy
surveys can accurately measure the relative velocity effect and subtract it
from the power spectrum analysis to constrain dark energy models with high

calculation of the $\beta$-function which describes the evolution of this
theory's running coupling constant predicts that it has a second zero at a
finite coupling. This non-trivial zero would be an infrared stable fixed point,
in which case the theory with massless quarks would be a conformal field
theory. However, if the interaction between quarks and antiquarks becomes
strong enough that a chiral condensate forms before this IR fixed point is
reached, the theory is QCD-like with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and
confinement. However, the presence of the nearby IR fixed point means that
there is a range of couplings for which the running coupling evolves very
slowly, i.e. it 'walks'. We are simulating the lattice version of this theory
with staggered quarks at finite temperature studying the changes in couplings
at the deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoring transitions as the temporal
extent ($N_t$) of the lattice, measured in lattice units, is increased. Our
earlier results on lattices with $N_t=4,6$ show both transitions move to weaker
couplings as $N_t$ increases consistent with walking behaviour. In this paper
we extend these calculations to $N_t=8$. Although both transition again move to
weaker couplings the change in the coupling at the chiral transition from
$N_t=6$ to $N_t=8$ is appreciably smaller than that from $N_t=4$ to $N_t=6$.
This indicates that at $N_t=4,6$ we are seeing strong coupling effects and that
we will need results from $N_t > 8$ to determine if the chiral-transition
coupling approaches zero as $N_t \rightarrow \infty$, as needed for the theory
to walk.

5000 km/s, and carried out HI 21 cm line and H-band imaging observations. The
near-infrared Tully-Fisher relation was calibrated with a large sample of

distances and the peculiar velocities of the LV sample galaxies. Among the 36
sample LV galaxies with good quality HI line width measurements, only 15

in order to avoid the effect of Malmquist bias. The average peculiar velocity
of these 15 galaxies is found to be -419+208-251 km/s, which is not
significantly different from zero. Due to the intrinsically large scatter of
Tully-Fisher relation, we cannot conclude whether there is a systematic motion

of $g$. This is analogous to the usual theory of polar varieties in algebraic
geometry, where holomorphic functions are studied by looking at the
intersection of their fibers with those of a linear form. Here we replace the
linear form by a real quadratic map, the Morse function $g$.
  We then study $\mathcal{F}$ by looking at the intersection of its leaves with
the level sets of $g$, and the way how these intersections change as the sphere
gets smaller.

is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over the
approximate redshift (z) range 8--1.5. It will image >250,000 distant galaxies
using three separate cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope, from the
mid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure Type Ia
supernovae at z>1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles for
cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each with
extensive ancillary data. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates
cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of
galaxies down to a stellar mass of 10^9 M_\odot to z \approx 2, reaching the
knee of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies to z \approx 8.
The survey covers approximately 800 arcmin^2 and is divided into two parts. The
CANDELS/Deep survey (5\sigma\ point-source limit H=27.7 mag) covers \sim 125
arcmin^2 within GOODS-N and GOODS-S. The CANDELS/Wide survey includes GOODS and
three additional fields (EGS, COSMOS, and UDS) and covers the full area to a
5\sigma\ point-source limit of H \gtrsim 27.0 mag. Together with the Hubble
Ultra Deep Fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered ""wedding cake"" approach
that has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. Data from the survey are
nonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. In
this paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the CANDELS team
science goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selection
and geometry, and the observing design. The Hubble data processing and products
are described in a companion paper.

extensive multiwavelength observations. The primary CANDELS data consist of
imaging obtained in the Wide Field Camera 3 / infrared channel (WFC3/IR) and
UVIS channel, along with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The
CANDELS/Deep survey covers \sim125 square arcminutes within GOODS-N and
GOODS-S, while the remainder consists of the CANDELS/Wide survey, achieving a
total of \sim800 square arcminutes across GOODS and three additional fields
(EGS, COSMOS, and UDS). We summarize the observational aspects of the survey as
motivated by the scientific goals and present a detailed description of the
data reduction procedures and products from the survey. Our data reduction
methods utilize the most up to date calibration files and image combination
procedures. We have paid special attention to correcting a range of
instrumental effects, including CTE degradation for ACS, removal of electronic
bias-striping present in ACS data after SM4, and persistence effects and other
artifacts in WFC3/IR. For each field, we release mosaics for individual epochs
and eventual mosaics containing data from all epochs combined, to facilitate
photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry. A more
detailed overview of the science goals and observational design of the survey
are presented in a companion paper.

a role in self-dual field theory (see Juhl, 2009), and is defined in terms of

an effective field theory without explicit pions. Using the singlet
neutron-proton scattering length, the deuteron, and the triton binding energy
as input, the predictions $\ants=9.2\pm2.6 $fm, $\antt=7.6\pm1.6 $fm,
$\aphes=3.6\pm0.32 $fm, and $\aphet=3.1\pm 0.23 $fm are obtained. The
calculations employ the resonating group method and include the Coulomb
interaction when appropriate. The theoretical uncertainty is assessed via a
variation of the regulator parameter of the short-distance interaction from
$400 $MeV to $1.6 $GeV. The phase-shift and scattering-length results for the
proton-Helium-3 system are consistent with a recent phase shift analysis and
with model calculations. For neutron-triton, the results for the scattering
lengths in both singlet and triplet channels are significantly smaller than
suggested by R-matrix and partial-wave-analysis extractions from data. For a
better understanding of this discrepancy, the sensitivity of the low-energy
four-body scattering system to variations in the neutron-neutron and
proton-proton two-nucleon scattering lengths is calculated. Induced by strong
charge-symmetry-breaking contact interactions, this dependence is found
insignificant. In contrast, a strong correlation between the neutron-triton

single molecule calculation were succeeded to reconstruct the absorption
spectra but required to be scaling to match the experimental one. Different
computational methods (ab initio and semi-empirical) exhibit the differences in
the energy correction factor and the presence of transition states, however,
still conserve the main spectral features. In general, the semi-empirical
methods provide a better energy scaling factor, which means closer to the
experimental one. However, they lack of fine features or vertical transitions
with respect to the experimental spectra. The ab initio calculations result
more complete features than the semi-empirical methods, especially the TDDFT
with high level of basis sets that provides a good accuracy in transition
energies. The contribution of ground states and excited states orbitals in the
main vertical transitions is discussed based on orbital structure. This might
gives a new perspective to explain the energy transfer phenomena in the

active galactic nuclei, we examine radio loudness as a function of Eddington
ratio for a previously published sample of 199 AGN from five different
populations. After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total
radio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities
only, applying a previously established mass correction for these core
luminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley
type I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than
Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the
distribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is
much narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness
distribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated
radio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We
furthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire
sample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing
the AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries. We conclude that if the
mass-corrected core radio luminosity is a good measure of jet power, then black
hole spin may have considerably less impact on jet power than previously
reported, or that our sample does not include the extremes of spin. If the
spread in jet power is small then we suggest that characteristics of the
ambient environment and/or the radio source age could be equally as important
in producing a radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy seen in total radio luminosity.

spin-based information processing devices. Its highly advanced fabrication
technology facilitates the transition from individual devices to large-scale
processors, and the availability of an isotopically-purified $^{28}$Si form
with no magnetic nuclei overcomes what is a main source of spin decoherence in
many other materials. Nevertheless, the coherence lifetimes of electron spins
in the solid state have typically remained several orders of magnitude lower
than what can be achieved in isolated high-vacuum systems such as trapped ions.
Here we examine electron spin coherence of donors in very pure $^{28}$Si
material, with a residual $^{29}$Si concentration of less than 50 ppm and donor
densities of $10^{14-15}$ per cm$^3$. We elucidate three separate mechanisms
for spin decoherence, active at different temperatures, and extract a coherence
lifetime $T_2$ up to 2 seconds. In this regime, we find the electron spin is
sensitive to interactions with other donor electron spins separated by ~200 nm.
We apply a magnetic field gradient in order to suppress such interactions and
obtain an extrapolated electron spin $T_2$ of 10 seconds at 1.8 K. These
coherence lifetimes are without peer in the solid state by several orders of
magnitude and comparable with high-vacuum qubits, making electron spins of
donors in silicon ideal components of a quantum computer, or quantum memories
for systems such as superconducting qubits.

  For a model, being resplendent is a strengthening of being kappa-saturated.
Restricting ourselves to the case kappa > |T| for transparency, a model M is
kappa-resplendent means: when we expand M by <kappa individual constants (c_i:i

lambda=lambda^ kappa + 2^ {|T|}. Then we get a complete and satisfying answer:
this depends just on T being stable or unstable. In this case proving that for

mega-science project to build the largest single dish radio telescope in the
world. Its innovative engineering concept and design pave a new road to realize
a huge single dish in the most effective way. FAST also represents Chinese
contribution in the international efforts to build the square kilometer array
(SKA). Being the most sensitive single dish radio telescope, FAST will enable
astronomers to jump-start many science goals, for example, surveying the
neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way and other galaxies, detecting faint pulsars,
looking for the first shining stars, hearing the possible signals from other
civilizations, etc.
  The idea of sitting a large spherical dish in a karst depression is rooted in
Arecibo telescope. FAST is an Arecibo-type antenna with three outstanding
aspects: the karst depression used as the site, which is large to host the
500-meter telescope and deep to allow a zenith angle of 40 degrees; the active
main reflector correcting for spherical aberration on the ground to achieve a
full polarization and a wide band without involving complex feed systems; and
the light-weight feed cabin driven by cables and servomechanism plus a parallel
robot as a secondary adjustable system to move with high precision. The
feasibility studies for FAST have been carried out for 14 years, supported by
Chinese and world astronomical communities. The project time is 5.5 years from
the commencement of work in March of 2011 and the first light is expected to be
in 2016.
  This review intends to introduce FAST project with emphasis on the recent
progress since 2006. In this paper, the subsystems of FAST are described in
modest details followed by discussions of the fundamental science goals and
examples of early science projects.

multiverse are the same thing, and that the multiverse is necessary to give
exact operational meaning to probabilistic predictions from quantum mechanics.
  Decoherence - the modern version of wave-function collapse - is subjective in
that it depends on the choice of a set of unmonitored degrees of freedom, the
""environment"". In fact decoherence is absent in the complete description of any
region larger than the future light-cone of a measurement event. However, if
one restricts to the causal diamond - the largest region that can be causally
probed - then the boundary of the diamond acts as a one-way membrane and thus
provides a preferred choice of environment. We argue that the global multiverse
is a representation of the many-worlds (all possible decoherent causal diamond
histories) in a single geometry.
  We propose that it must be possible in principle to verify quantum-mechanical
predictions exactly. This requires not only the existence of exact observables
but two additional postulates: a single observer within the universe can access
infinitely many identical experiments; and the outcome of each experiment must
be completely definite. In causal diamonds with finite surface area,
holographic entropy bounds imply that no exact observables exist, and both
postulates fail: experiments cannot be repeated infinitely many times; and
decoherence is not completely irreversible, so outcomes are not definite. We
argue that our postulates can be satisfied in ""hats"" (supersymmetric multiverse
regions with vanishing cosmological constant). We propose a complementarity
principle that relates the approximate observables associated with finite
causal diamonds to exact observables in the hat.

advantage for the implementation and so hybrid systems to benefit from several
systems would be able to provide a promising approach. One of the common hybrid
approach is to combine a superconducting qubit as a controllable qubit and the
other quantum system with a long coherence time as a memory qubit. The
superconducting qubit allows us to have an excellent controllability of the
quantum states and the memory qubit is capable of storing the information for a
long time. By tuning the energy splitting between the superconducting qubit and
the memory qubit, it is believed that one can realize a selective coupling
between them. However, we have shown that this approach has a fundamental
drawback concerning energy leakage from the memory qubit. The detuned
superconducting qubit is usually affected by severe decoherence, and this
causes an incoherent energy relaxation from the memory qubit to the
superconducting qubit via the imperfect decoupling. We have also found that
this energy transport can be interpreted as an appearance of anti quantum Zeno
effect induced by the fluctuation in the superconducting qubit. We also discuss
a possible solution to avoid such energy relaxation process, which is feasible
with existing technology.

spectroscopy --- is probing unocccupied electronic states. By investigating the
L2,3-edge x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and x-ray magnetic

improves the LSDA results, in particular concerning the asymmetry of the L3
white line. Differences with respect to the experiment, nevertheless, remain
--- particularly concerning the ratio of the intensities of the L3 and L2
peaks. The changes in the XMCD peak intensities invoked by the use of the
LSDA+DMFT are a consequence of the improved description of the orbital
polarization and are consistent with the XMCD sum rules. Accounting for the
core hole within the final state approximation does not generally improve the
results. This indicates that to get more accurate L2,3-edge XANES and XMCD

profited from the introduction of major staple crops which had been
domesticated elsewhere; in both regions, the temperate climate and originally
predominant forest vegetation provided an environmental context conducive to
agriculture. To understand the different paths to agricultural subsistence, an
integrated view of technological innovation, domestication and exchange of
domesticates, migration and trade is required within the constraints imposed by
the environmental context and geography. This study makes use of a numerical
model of regional socio-technological evolution which builds on adaptation of
important characteristics of prehistoric societies such as technology and
subsistence diversity. With this Global Land Use and Technological Evolution
Simulator (GLUES), regional transitions from foraging to agropastoralism, and
associated land use and demographic changes are realistically hindcasted. I
show that the model is capable of explaining the different timing, speed, and
transition mechanisms: Europe received a large package of foreign domesticates
and converted rapidly to agriculture, this fast transition can be best
explained with demic and cultural diffusion followed by fast adoption by
resident foragers. In contrast, ENA trajectories show a more gradual
transition. Hunting-gathering and agropastoral life style coexisted for a long
time and agriculture was adopted slowly into the existing subsistence scheme.

(FSO) systems, when multiple parallel relays are employed and there is no

all-active FSO relaying, where all the available relays transmit concurrently,
we propose schemes that select only a single relay to participate in the
communication between the source and the destination in each transmission slot.
This selection is based on the channel state information (CSI) obtained either
from all or from some of the FSO links. Thus, the need for synchronizing the
relays' transmissions is avoided and the slowly varying nature of the
atmospheric channel is exploited. For both relay selection and all-active
relaying, novel closed-form expressions for their outage performance are
derived, assuming the versatile Gamma-Gamma channel model. Furthermore, based
on the derived analytical results, the problem of allocating the optical power
resources to the FSO links is addressed, and optimum and suboptimum solutions
are proposed. Numerical results are provided for equal and non-equal length FSO
links, which illustrate the outage behavior of the considered relaying

leads only to minor changes compared to the one-particle picture of the local

substantial increase of the thermopower: the number of (quasi-)electrons around
the Fermi level is much more suppressed than that of the (quasi-)holes. Hence,
there is a particle-hole imbalance acting in the same direction as a similar

positive thermopower. Introducing a thermoelectric spectral density, we located

studied for three initial configurations: complete and partial population

leads to a strong increase of the tunneling time period analogous to the

forms of the generators to get the explicit form of the massive fields of any

raising operators of the little group, then dictates other amplitudes with
higher helicity in the same spin multiplets. The formalism allows, in
principle, to determine the electromagnetic form-factors of charged particles

conductivity of three-dimensional composites in the presence of a strong
magnetic field. On the one hand, it is shown that for general composites the
antisymmetric part of the effective conductivity cannot be bounded solely in
terms of the antisymmetric part of the local conductivity, contrary to the
columnar case. So, a suitable rank-two laminate the conductivity of which has a
bounded antisymmetric part together with a high-contrast symmetric part, may
generate an arbitrarily large antisymmetric part of the effective conductivity.
On the other hand, bounds are provided which show that the antisymmetric part
of the effective conductivity must go to zero if the upper bound on the
antisymmetric part of the local conductivity goes to zero, and the symmetric
part of the local conductivity remains bounded below and above. Elementary
bounds on the effective moduli are derived assuming the local conductivity and
effective conductivity have transverse isotropy in the plane orthogonal to the
magnetic field. New Hashin-Shtrikman type bounds for two-phase
three-dimensional composites with a non-symmetric conductivity are provided
under geometric isotropy of the microstructure. The derivation of the bounds is
based on a particular variational principle symmetrizing the problem, and the
use of Y-tensors involving the averages of the fields in each phase.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We implement it in the context
of nearly full sky, multifrequency, B-mode polarization observations,
incorporating statistical uncertainties due to the CMB sky statistics,
instrumental noise, as well as the presence of the foreground signals. We model
the effects of a subtraction of these using a parametric maximum likelihood
technique and optimize the instrumental configuration with predefined or
arbitrary observational frequency channels, constraining either a total number
of detectors or a focal plane area. We showcase the proposed formalism by
applying it to two cases of experimental setups based on the CMBpol and COrE
mission concepts looked at as dedicated B-mode experiments. We find that, if
the models of the foregrounds available at the time of the optimization are
sufficiently precise, the procedure can help to either improve the potential
scientific outcome of the experiment by a factor of a few, while allowing one
to avoid excessive hardware complexity, or simplify the instrument design
without compromising its science goals. However, our analysis also shows that
even if the available foreground models are not considered to be sufficiently
reliable, the proposed procedure can guide a design of more robust experimental
setups. While better suited to cope with a plausible, greater complexity of the
foregrounds than that foreseen by the models, these setups could ensure science
results close to the best achievable, should the models be found to be correct.

specific WSN systems or are integrated in complex applications. Thus it is very
difficult to comparatively study their performance and almost impossible to
reuse them in future applications under a different scope. In this work we
study a large body of well established algorithms. We identify their main
building blocks and propose a component-based architecture for developing
clustering algorithms that (a) promotes exchangeability of algorithms thus
enabling the fast prototyping of new approaches, (b) allows cross-layer
implementations to realize complex applications, (c) offers a common platform

demonstrating the scalability of the original algorithms beyond their original

storage, has only been demonstrated with near-infrared excitation to date.
However, in absorbing materials, such high photon energies can lead to
significant dissipation, making switch back times long and miniaturization
challenging. In manganites, magnetism is directly coupled to the lattice, as
evidenced by the response to external and chemical pressure, or to
ferroelectric polarization. Here, femtosecond mid-infrared pulses are used to
excite the lattice in La0.5Sr1.5MnO4 and the dynamics of electronic order are
measured by femtosecond resonant soft x-ray scattering with an x-ray free
electron laser. We observe that magnetic and orbital orders are reduced by
excitation of the lattice. This process, which occurs within few picoseconds,
is interpreted as relaxation of the complex charge-orbital-spin structure
following a displacive exchange quench - a prompt shift in the equilibrium
value of the magnetic and orbital order parameters after the lattice has been
distorted. A microscopic picture of the underlying unidirectional lattice
displacement is proposed, based on nonlinear rectification of the
directly-excited vibrational field, as analyzed in the specific lattice
symmetry of La0.5Sr1.5MnO4. Control of magnetism through ultrafast lattice
excitation has important analogies to the multiferroic effect and may serve as
a new paradigm for high-speed optomagnetism.

morphologies: the former is disk-dominated while the latter is almost entirely
bulge-dominated. It has been argued (van der Kruit 1983) that since the two
galaxies, which are optically so different, have similar rotation curves their
total mass distributions cannot be related in any way to the light
distributions. This would lead to the conclusion that dark matter is the
dominating component of the mass. We have derived new rotation curves from
recent, high-sensitivity HI observations and have found that the shapes of the
rotation curves are significantly different for the two galaxies. They indicate
that in NGC7814 the mass is more concentrated to the centre as compared to
NGC891. This reflects the distribution of light which is more centrally
concentrated in NGC7814 than in NGC891. Mass and light do seem to be closely
related. This is confirmed by the analysis of the rotation curves in mass
components: solutions close to the maximum light (bulge + disk) do provide
excellent fits. In NGC891 bulge and disk can explain the rotation curve without
any need for dark matter out to ~15 kpc. In NGC7814 the bulge dominates in the
inner parts; further out the rotation curve is well reproduced by a maximum
disk but its M/L ratio is excessively high. A substantial dark matter
contribution, closely coupled to the luminous component, seems, therefore,
necessary.

variate that is evaluated directly using the simulation data. Here, the
performance of this estimator is assessed numerically for free energy
calculations in generic binary alloys and compared to those of other estimators
taken from the literature. A systematic investigation with varying simulation
parameters of a simplified system, the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model, is first
carried out in the transmutation ensemble using path-sampling. We observe
numerically that (i) the variance of the Delmas-Jourdain estimator is indeed
reduced compared to that of other estimators; and that (ii) the resulting
reduction is close to the maximal possible one, despite the inaccuracy in the
estimated control variate. More extensive path-sampling simulations involving a
FeCr alloy system described by a many-body potential additionally show that
(iii) gradual transmutations accommodate the atomic frustrations, thus
alleviating the numerical ergodicity issue present in numerous alloy systems
and eventually enabling the determination of phase coexistence conditions.

the longitudinal dataset of Italian cattle movements that reports the mobility

inter-relations between topology, function and dynamical nature of the system

stationarity of statistical distributions coexists with a strong and
non-trivial evolutionary dynamics at the node and link levels, on all

patterns of structural changes affecting nodes' centrality and farms' spreading
potential, thus limiting the efficiency of interventions based on partial

uncover the presence of a temporal arrow describing the evolution of the system

them jointly when extracting EWPT bounds and to fully take in to account the

consequence is that the extra gauge bosons must be heavier than 250 GeV. Their
couplings to SM fermions, even if bounded, might be of the same order of
magnitude than the SM ones. In contrast to other Higgsless models, the 4-site
model is not fermiophobic. The new gauge bosons could thus be discovered in the

understood, and in particular the growth of dust aggregates above millimeter
sizes has recently turned out to be a difficult task in our understanding [Zsom
et al. 2010, A&A, 513, A57]. Laboratory experiments have shown that dust
aggregates of these sizes stick to one another only at unreasonably low
velocities. However, in the protoplanetary disk, millimeter-sized particles are
known to have been ubiquitous. One can find relics of them in the form of solid
chondrules as the main constituent of chondrites. Most of these chondrules were
found to feature a fine-grained rim, which is hypothesized to have formed from
accreting dust grains in the solar nebula. To study the influence of these
dust-coated chondrules on the formation of chondrites and possibly
planetesimals, we conducted collision experiments between millimeter-sized,
dust-coated chondrule analogs at velocities of a few cm/s. For 2 and 3 mm
diameter chondrule analogs covered by dusty rims of a volume filling factor of
0.18 and 0.35-0.58, we found sticking velocities of a few cm/s. This velocity
is higher than the sticking velocity of dust aggregates of the same size. We
therefore conclude that chondrules may be an important step towards a deeper
understanding of the collisional growth of larger bodies. Moreover, we analyzed
the collision behavior in an ensemble of dust aggregates and non-coated
chondrule analogs. While neither the dust aggregates nor the solid chondrule
analogs show sticking in collisions among their species, we found an enhanced
sicking efficiency in collisions between the two constituents, which leads us
to the conjecture that chondrules might act as ""catalyzers"" for the growth of
larger bodies in the young Solar System.

Extensive broadband observational data are available for this system from radio
band to very high energy (VHE) range. The multi-frequency emission is unpulsed
and nonthermal, and is generally thought to be related to the relativistic
electrons accelerated from the interaction between the pulsar wind and the
stellar wind, where X-ray emission is from the synchrotron process and the VHE
emission is from the inverse Compton (IC) scattering process. Here a shocked
wind model with variation of the magnetic parameter $\sigma$ is developed for
explaining the observations. By choosing proper param- eters, our model could
reproduce two-peak profile in X-ray and TeV light curves. The effect of the
disk exhibits an emission and an absorption components in the X-ray and TeV

boosting the synchrotron spectrum. This model can possibly be used and be
checked in other similar systems such as LS I+61o303 and LS 5039.

worth further studies in the laboratory. The sticking threshold velocity of
millimeter-sized dust aggregates is such a critical value that had so far only
theoretically been derived, as the relevant velocities could not be reached in

first time to study free collisions of mm-sized dust aggregates down to

between 0.2 and 3 cm/s led to sticking, suggesting a transition from perfect
sticking to perfect bouncing with a certain sticking probability instead of a
sharp velocity threshold. We developed a model to explain the physical
processes involved in dust-aggregate sticking, derived dynamic material

deduced the velocity below which aggregates always stick. For millimeter-sized

for the detection of gravitational waves---are computationally expensive,
especially for binaries with high mass ratios or with rapidly spinning
constituent holes. Existing codes for evolving binary black holes rely on
explicit timestepping methods, for which the timestep size is limited by the
smallest spatial scale through the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Binary
inspiral typically involves spatial scales (the spatial resolution required by
a small or rapidly spinning hole) which are orders of magnitude smaller than
the relevant (orbital, precession, and radiation-reaction) timescales
characterizing the inspiral. Therefore, in explicit evolutions of binary black
holes, the timestep size is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the
relevant physical timescales. Implicit timestepping methods allow for larger
timesteps, and they often reduce the total computational cost (without
significant loss of accuracy) for problems dominated by spatial rather than
temporal error, such as for binary-black-hole inspiral in corotating
coordinates. However, fully implicit methods can be difficult to implement for
nonlinear evolution systems like the Einstein equations. Therefore, in this
paper we explore implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods and use them for the first
time to evolve black-hole spacetimes. Specifically, as a first step toward IMEX
evolution of a full binary-black-hole spacetime, we develop an IMEX algorithm
for the generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations and use this
algorithm to evolve stationary and perturbed single-black-hole spacetimes.
Numerical experiments explore the stability and computational efficiency of our
method.

follow-up observations of two Herschel-ATLAS (H-ATLAS) detected strongly lensed
distant galaxies. In one of the targeted galaxies H-ATLAS J090311.6+003906
(SDP.81) we detect [OIII] 88\mum and [CII] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noise
ratio of ~5. We do not have any positive line identification in the other
fainter target H-ATLAS J091305.0-005343 (SDP.130). Currently SDP.81 is the
faintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the FTS, with
continuum flux just below 200 mJy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. The
derived redshift of SDP.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, in
agreement with ground-based CO measurements. This is the first detection by
Herschel of the [OIII] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.
Comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociation
region (PDR) models with different physical conditions, we derive the PDR cloud
density n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-UV ionizing radiation field G_0 ~ 200 (in
units of the Habing field -- the local Galactic interstellar radiation field of
1.6x10^{-6} W/m^2). Using the CO derived molecular mass and the PDR properties
we estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. These
characteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. The radio
observations indicate that SDP.81 deviates significantly from the local
FIR/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission is
coming from an AGN. The constraints on the source size from millimiter-wave
observations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible AGN
contribution to less than 33%. These indications, together with the high
[OIII]/FIR ratio and the upper limit of [OI] 63\mum/[CII] 158\mum suggest that
some fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an AGN.

in a quantum wire drives a transition from a metallic to an insulating state
when the wave number of the modulation becomes commensurate with the Fermi wave
length of the electrons in the wire. It was suggested that the effect may be
put to practical use in a future spin transistor design. In the present article
we revisit the problem and present a detailed analysis of the underlying
physics. First, we explore how the build-up of charge density wave correlations
in the quantum wire due to the periodic gate configuration that produces the
Rashba modulation influences the transition to the insulating state. The
interplay between the modulations of the charge density and that of the
spin-orbit coupling turns out to be quite subtle: Depending on the relative
phase between the two modulations, the joint action of the Rashba interaction
and charge density wave correlations may either enhance or reduce the Rashba
current blockade effect. Secondly, we inquire about the role of the Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling that is generically present in a quantum wire embedded in
semiconductor heterostructure. While the Dresselhaus coupling is found to work
against the current blockade of the insulating state, the effect is small in
most materials. Using an effective field theory approach, we also carry out an
analysis of effects from electron- electron interactions, and show how the
single-particle gap in the insulating state can be extracted from the more
easily accessible collective charge and spin excitation thresholds. The
smallness of the single-particle gap together with the anti-phase relation
between the Rashba and chemical potential modulations pose serious difficulties
for realizing a Rashba-controlled current switch in an InAs-based device. Some
alternative designs are discussed.

  Webcams",,,,,"cs.NI stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Realistic modeling of vehicular mobility has been particularly challenging
due to a lack of large libraries of measurements in the research community. In
this paper we introduce a novel method for large-scale monitoring, analysis,
and identification of spatio-temporal models for vehicular mobility using the
freely available online webcams in cities across the globe. We collect
vehicular mobility traces from 2,700 traffic webcams in 10 different cities for
several months and generate a mobility dataset of 7.5 Terabytes consisting of
125 million of images. To the best of our knowl- edge, this is the largest data
set ever used in such study. To process and analyze this data, we propose an
efficient and scalable algorithm to estimate traffic density based on
background image subtraction. Initial results show that at least 82% of
individual cameras with less than 5% deviation from four cities follow
Loglogistic distribution and also 94% cameras from Toronto follow gamma
distribution. The aggregate results from each city also demonstrate that Log-
Logistic and gamma distribution pass the KS-test with 95% confidence.
Furthermore, many of the camera traces exhibit long range dependence, with
self-similarity evident in the aggregates of traffic (per city). We believe our
novel data collection method and dataset provide a much needed contribution to
the research community for realistic modeling of vehicular networks and
mobility.
