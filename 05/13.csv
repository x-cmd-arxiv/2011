the structures of diamondoids in the excited state show a distortion which is

measure how apparent morphologies (disk, elliptical, peculiar) correlate with
physical properties, such as quantitative structure and spectral-types. One
primary result is that apparent morphology does not correlate strongly with
stellar populations, nor with galaxy structure at this epoch, suggesting a
chaotic formation history for Hubble types at z > 1. By using a locally defined
definition of disk and elliptical galaxies based on structure and
spectral-type, we find no true ellipticals at z > 2, and a fraction of
3.2+/-2.3% at 1.5 < z < 2. Local counterparts of disk galaxies are at a similar
level of 7-10%, much lower than the 75% fraction at lower redshifts. We further
compare WFC3 images with the rest-frame UV view of galaxies from ACS imaging,
showing that galaxies imaged with ACS that appear peculiar often contain an
`elliptical' like morphology in WFC3. We show through several simulations that
this larger fraction of elliptical-like galaxies is partially due to the
courser PSF of WFC3, and that the `elliptical' class very likely includes
early-type disks. We also measure the merger history for our sample using CAS
parameters, finding a redshift evolution increasing with redshift, and a peak
merger fraction of ~30% at z~2 for the most massive galaxies with M_*> 10^{10}
M_sol, consistent with previous results from ACS and NICMOS. We compare our
results to semi-analytical model results and find a relatively good agreement
between our morphological break-down and the predictions. Finally, we argue
that the peculiars, ellipticals and peculiar ellipticals have similar

pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules. The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of
apoptosis is governed up-stream of mitochondria, by the family of Bcl-2
proteins, and down-stream of mitochondria, by low-probability events, such as
apoptosome formation, and by feedback circuits involving caspases and inhibitor
of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP. All these regulatory mechanisms
ensure that cells only commit to death once a threshold of damage has been
reached and the anti-apoptotic reserve of the cell is overcome. As cancer cells
are invariably exposed to strong intracellular and extracellular stress
stimuli, they are particularly reliant on the expression of anti-apoptotic
proteins. Hence, many cancer cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to agents
that inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecules, such as BH3 mimetics, while normal
cells remain relatively insensitive to single agent treatments with the same
class of molecules. Targeting different proteins within the apoptotic network
with combinatorial treatment approaches often achieves even greater
specificity. This led us to investigate the sensitivity of leukemia and
lymphoma cells to a pro-apoptotic action of a BH3 mimetic combined with a small
molecule inhibitor of XIAP. Using computational probabilistic model of
apoptotic pathway, verified by experimental results from human leukemia and
lymphoma cell lines, we show that inhibition of XIAP has a non-linear effect on
sensitization towards apoptosis induced by the BH3 mimetic HA14-1. This study
justifies further ex vivo and animal studies on the potential of the treatment
of leukemia and lymphoma with a combination of BH3 mimetics and XIAP
inhibitors.

quality of a physical property of a quantum system being independent of

disturbing the subsequent evolution of a system. One of the key requirement for
testing the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality, or Bell's time

such a measurement for maximally mixed states. The operation of the circuit is

the 3-500um SEDs of galaxies at 0<z<2.5, supplemented by a local reference
sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer and AKARI data. We find that the ratio of total
IR luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, IR8 (=Lir/L8), follows a Gaussian
distribution centered on IR8=4 and defines an IR main sequence (MS). A minority
population (<20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values of
IR8 consist of starbursts (SB) with compact projected star formation densities.
IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star
formation from compact SBs with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness
(>3x10^10 Lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific SFR (i.e., SBs). The rest-frame,
UV-2700A size of these distant SBs is typically half that of MS galaxies,
supporting the correlation between star formation density and SB activity that
is measured for the local sample. Locally, (U)LIRGs are systematically in the
SB mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the ""normal"" MS mode. This
confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called
""mid-IR excess"" population of galaxies found at z>1.5 by previous studies. MS
galaxies have strong PAH emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting
from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust~15-50 K), and an effective
Tdust~31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their IR SED. Galaxies in
the SB regime instead exhibit weak PAH EW and a sharper far-IR bump with an
effective Tdust~40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR
emission of X-ray AGNs is predominantly produced by star formation and that
candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically
occur in compact, dusty SBs. After correcting for the effect of SBs on IR8, we
identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.

photons in a plasma wire, that is, a system in which the electrons are confined
to a one-dimensional tube or wire, but are otherwise free. We find the
appropriate expression for the photon \emph{free-field} propagator in such a
medium, and write down the dispersion relation in terms of the free-field
propagator and the photon self-energy. The self-energy is then calculated in
the one-loop approximation and the corresponding dispersion relation is
determined and studied in some detail. Our work differs from previous work on
this subject in that we do not adopt any specific electronic wave functions in
the coordinates that are transverse to the idealized wire, or rely on
particular features of the electronic structure. We treat the electrons as a
free gas of particles, constrained to move in one dimension, but otherwise in a
model-independent way only following the rules of TFT adapted to the situation
at hand. For the appropriate conditions of the plasma the \emph{static
approximation} can be employed and the dispersion relation reduces to the
results obtained in previous works, but the formula that we obtain is valid
under more general conditions, including those in which the static
approximation is not valid. In particular, the dispersion relation has several
branches, which are not revealed if the static approximation is used. The
dispersion relations obtained reproduce several unique features of these
systems that have been observed in recent experiments.

fixed redshift exhibit similar amplitudes of clustering. In addition, QSO
clustering evolution at z>0.5 is well fitted by a model that assumes a fixed
host halo mass, implying that QSOs may occur in a relatively narrow range of
halo and BH mass. We argue that the slow evolution of early-type galaxies out
to z~1-2 may also provide support for a slow evolution of QSO host BH masses.
The result would mean that if high-z QSOs radiate at Eddington rates then low-z
SyI must radiate at ~100x less than Eddington. We conclude that models where
QSOs radiate at L_Edd require M_BH and M_halo to be decoupled to circumvent the
clustering results. While single BH mass and flickering models fit the z>0.5
clustering results, they appear to be rejected by the z~0, M_BH-L relation from
reverberation mapping. We find that the inclusion of z<0.5 QSO clustering data
improves the fit of a long-lived QSO model and suggest that the predictions of
a PLE model for QSO BH masses agree reasonably with UV-bump and reverberation
estimates (abridged).

given in terms of a perturbation of the AdS-CFT solution, with the perturbation
parameter being the radius of curvature of the brane metric compared to the AdS
length \ell. The brane metric is then a specific perturbation of the AdS-CFT
boundary metric. For low curvatures the RSII solution reproduces 4d GR on the
brane. The leading correction is from local higher derivative curvature terms.
The subleading correction is derived from similar terms and also the dual CFT
stress tensor. Recently AdS-CFT solutions with 4d Schwarzschild boundary metric
were numerically constructed. We modify the boundary conditions to introduce
the RSII brane, and use elliptic numerical methods to solve the resulting
boundary value problem. We construct large RSII static black holes with radius
up to ~ 20 \ell. For large radius the RSII solutions are indeed close to the
associated AdS-CFT solution. In this case the local curvature corrections
vanish, and we confirm the leading correction is given by the AdS-CFT solution
stress tensor. We also follow the black holes to small radius << \ell, where as
expected they transition to a 5d behaviour. Our numerical solutions indicate
the RSII black holes are dynamically stable for axisymmetric perturbations for
all radii.

Prestellar cores feature a flat central part of the column density and volume
density profiles of the same size indicating the existence of a uniform density
inner region. The size of this region is set by the thermal pressure force
which depends only on the central volume density and temperature of the core,
and can provide a direct measurement of the central volume density. Thus a
simple length measurement can immediately yield a central density estimate
independent of any dynamical model for the core and without the need for
fitting. Using the radius at which the column density is 90% of the central
value as an estimate of the size of the flat inner part of the column density
profile yields an estimate of the central volume density within a factor of 2

constrain the LMXB formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies. We confirm that
NGC1399 has the highest LMXB fraction in GCs of all nearby elliptical galaxies
studied so far, even though the exact value depends on galactocentric distance
due to the interplay of a differential GC vs galaxy light distribution and the
GC color dependence. In fact LMXBs are preferentially hosted by bright, red GCs
out to $>5 R_{eff}$ of the galaxy light. The finding that GC hosting LMXBs
follow the radial distribution of their parent GC population, argues against
the hypothesis that the external dynamical influence of the galaxy affects LMXB
formation in GCs. On the other hand field LMXBs closely match the host galaxy
light, thus indicating that they are originally formed in situ and not inside
GCs. We measure GC structural parameters, finding that the LMXB formation
likelihood is influenced independently by mass, metallicity and GCs structural
parameters. In particular the GC central density plays a major role in
predicting which GC host accreting binaries. Finally our analysis shows that
LMXBs in GCs are marginally brighter than those in the field, and in particular
the only color-confirmed GC with $L_X>10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ shows no
variability, which may indicate a superposition of multiple LMXBs in these

the formation of a secularly-formed ""pseudo"" bulge, with the final

fields in gravitationally stratified plasmas using simplified, plane-parallel
numerical simulations. Since the physical heating mechanism remains uncertain
in massive halos such as groups or clusters, we adopt a simple,
observationally-motivated prescription which enforces global thermal
equilibrium when averaged over large scales. The plasma remains susceptible to
local thermal instability, however, and cooling drives an inward flow of
material. In contrast to previous results, we argue that the thermal stability
of the plasma is independent of its convective stability. We find that the
ratio of the cooling timescale to the dynamical timescale t_cool/t_ff controls
the saturation of the thermal instability: when t_cool/t_ff < 1, the plasma
develops extended multi-phase structure, whereas when t_cool / t_ff > 1 it does
not. (In a companion paper, we show that the criterion for thermal instability
in a spherical potential is somewhat less stringent, t_cool / t_ff < 10.) When
thermal conduction is anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field, the
criterion for multi-phase structure is essentially independent of the thermal
conductivity of the plasma. Our criterion for local thermal instability to
produce multi-phase structure is an extension of the cold vs. hot accretion
modes in galaxy formation that applies at all radii in hot halos, not just to
the virial shock. We show that this criterion is consistent with data on
multi-phase gas in the ACCEPT sample of clusters; in addition, when t_cool /
t_ff > 1, the net cooling rate to low temperatures and the mass flux to small
radii are suppressed enough relative to models without heating to be
qualitatively consistent with star formation rates and x-ray line emission in
groups and clusters.

research at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) that paves the way for novel tests of QCD multi-parton dynamics
in dense nuclear matter. At present, perturbative QCD calculations of hard
probes in elementary nucleon-nucleon reactions can be consistently combined
with the effects of the nuclear medium up to $ {\cal O}(\alpha_s^3) $. While
such accuracy is desirable but not necessary for leading particle tomography,
it is absolutely essential for the new jet observables. With this motivation,
we present first results and predictions to $ {\cal O}(\alpha_s^3) $ for the
recent LHC lead-lead (Pb+Pb) run at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per
nucleon-nucleon pair. Specifically, we focus on the suppression of the single

final-state inelastic parton interactions in the QGP, but also initial-state
cold nuclear matter effects and an estimate of the non-perturbative
hadronization corrections. We demonstrate how an enhanced di-jet asymmetry in
central Pb+Pb reactions at the LHC, recently measured by the ATLAS and CMS
experiments, can be derived from these results. We show quantitatively that a
fraction of this enhancement may be related to the ambiguity in the separation
between the jet and the soft background medium and/or the diffusion of the
parton shower energy away from the jet axis through collisional processes. We
point to a suite of measurements that can help build a consistent picture of
parton shower modification in heavy ion collisions at the LHC.

years, implying accretion at a high rate onto a massive white dwarf. However,
previous X-ray observations of the system in quiescence have detected only
faint emission that is difficult to reconcile with the high accretion rate
predicted by nova theory for such frequent outbursts. Here, we use new Chandra
and XMM-Newton observations obtained 537 and 744 days after the 2006 outburst
to constrain both the accretion rate onto the white dwarf and the properties of
the nova ejecta at these times. We detect low level UV variability with the
XMM-Newton Optical Monitor on day 744 that is consistent with accretion disk
flickering, and use this to place a lower limit on the accretion rate. The
X-ray spectra in both observations are well described by a two component
thermal plasma model. The first component originates in the nova shell, which
can emit X-rays for up to a decade after the outburst. The other component
likely arises in the accretion disk boundary layer, and can be equally well fit
by a single temperature plasma or a cooling flow model. Although the flux of
the single temperature model implies an accretion rate that is 40 times lower
than theoretical predictions for RS Oph, the best fit cooling flow model
implies Mdot < 1.2x10^-8 M_sol/yr 537 days after the outburst, which is within
a factor of 2 of the theoretical accretion rate required to power an outburst
every 20 years. Furthermore, we place an upper limit on the accretion rate
through an optically thick region of the boundary layer of 2.0x10^-8 M_sol/yr.
Thus, the X-ray emission in quiescence is consistent with the accretion rate
expectations of nova theory. Finally, we discuss the possible origins of the
low temperature associated with the accretion component, which is a factor of
10 lower than in T CrB, an otherwise similar recurrent nova.

formation rate density history is dominated by the large spirals in the volume,

rate density has decreased since z~1, the measured rates during this epoch are
higher than those obtained from other measurement techniques. This enhanced
recent star formation rate appears to be largely due to an increase in the
fraction of star formation contained in low-mass disks at recent times.
Finally, our results indicate that despite the differences at recent times, the

core accretion or disk instability is the dominant mode of planet formation.
Over the last decade, several lines of evidence have been presented showing
that core accretion is most likely the dominant mechanism for the close-in
population of planets probed by radial velocity and transits. However, this
does not by itself prove that core accretion is the dominant mode for the total
planet population, since disk instability might conceivably produce and retain
large numbers of planets in the far-out regions of the disk. If this is a
relevant scenario, then the outer massive disks of B-stars should be among the
best places for massive planets and brown dwarfs to form and reside. In this
study, we present high-contrast imaging of 18 nearby massive stars, of which 15
are in the B2--A0 spectral type range and provide excellent sensitivity to wide
companions. By comparing our sensitivities to model predictions of disk
instability based on physical criteria for fragmentation and cooling, and using
Monte-Carlo simulations for orbital distributions, we find that ~85 % of such
companions should have been detected in our images on average. Given this high
degree of completeness, stringent statistical limits can be set from the
null-detection result, even with the limited sample size. We find that <32 % of
massive stars form and retain disk instability planets, brown dwarfs and very
low-mass stars of <100 Mjup within 300 AU, at 99 % confidence. These results,
combined with previous findings in the literature, lead to the conclusion that
core accretion is likely the dominant mode of planet formation.

transition during the evolution of S0 galaxies. In high density environments,
gas loss can be achieved via many external mechanisms. However, in relatively
isolated environments, where these external mechanisms cannot be efficient, gas
loss must be dominated by some internal processes. We perform Chandra analysis
of hot gas in five nearby isolated S0 galaxies, based on quantitative
subtraction of various stellar contributions. We find that all the galaxies
studied in the present work are X-ray faint, with the hot gas luminosity LX<5%
of the expected Ia SN energy injection rate. We further compare our results
with those from relevant recent papers, in order to investigate the energy
budget, cold-hot gas relation, and gas removal from S0 galaxies in isolated
environments. We find that elliptical and S0 galaxies are not significantly
different in LX at the low mass end (typically with LK<1e11Lsun). However, at
the high mass end, S0 galaxies tend to have significantly lower LX than
elliptical galaxies of the same stellar masses. We further discuss the
potential relation of the diffuse X-ray emission with the cold gas content in
S0 and elliptical galaxies. We find that LX/LK^2 tends to correlate positively
with the total cold gas mass M(H2+HI) for gas-poor galaxies with
M(H2+HI)<1e8Msun, while they anti-correlate with each other for gas-rich ones.
This cold-hot gas relation can be explained in a scenario of galaxy evolution,
with the leftover cold gas from the precursor star forming galaxy mainly
removed by the long-lasting Ia SN feedback. The two different trends for
gas-rich and -poor galaxies may be the results of the initial fast decreasing
SN rate and the later fast decreasing mass-loading to hot gas, respectively.

physical insight about the measurement being performed, providing information
about the correlation strength between system and detector, the measurement

particle-like which-path information in the system interferometer,
demonstrating wave-particle complementarity between the system and detector. We
also find that the degree of quantum erasure that can be achieved by
conditioning on a specific detector drain is directly related to the ambiguity
of the measurement. Finally, conditioning the which-path averages on a
particular system drain using the zero frequency cross-correlations produces
conditioned averages that can become anomalously large due to quantum
interference; the weak coupling limit of these conditioned averages can produce
both weak values and detector-dependent semi-weak values.

we show that symplectic hopfoids provide a characterization of symplectic

single-component sBzK galaxies with the single S\'ersic profile using the
ACS/F850LP image and find that a majority of them (64%) show S\'ersic index of
n=0.5-2.5, indicating that they have a disk-like structure. The resulting
effective radii typically range from 1.0 to 3.0 kpc in the rest-frame UV
wavelength. After correcting the effective radii to those in the rest-frame
optical wavelength, we find that the single-component sBzK galaxies locate in
the region where the local and z~1 disk galaxies distribute in the stellar
mass-size diagram, suggesting comparable surface stellar mass density between
the sBzK and z~0-1 disk galaxies. All these properties suggest that the
single-component sBzK galaxies are progenitors of the present-day disk
galaxies. However, by studying their intrinsic shape through comparison between
the observed distribution of apparent axial ratios and the distribution for
triaxial models with axes (A>B>C), we find that the mean B/A ratio is
0.61^{+0.05}_{-0.08} and disk thickness C/A is 0.28^{+0.03}_{-0.04}. This
indicates that the single-component sBzK galaxies at z~2 have a bar-like or
oval shape rather than a round disk shape. The shape seems to resemble to a
bar/oval structure that form through bar instability; if it is the case, the
intrinsic shape may give us a clue to understand dynamical evolution of
baryonic matter in a dark matter halo.

than 500 m/pixel. We use recent updates to crater scaling laws and their
constants to estimate the amount of mass ejected in three different velocity
ranges: (i) greater than escape velocity, (ii) less than escape velocity and
faster than the minimum velocity required to make a secondary crater (v_min),
and (iii) velocities less than v_min. Although the vast majority of mass on
each satellite is ejected at speeds less than v_min, our calculations
demonstrate that the differences in mass available in the other two categories
should lead to observable differences in the small crater populations; the
predictions are borne out by the measurements we have made to date. Rhea,
Tethys, and Dione have sufficient surface gravities to retain ejecta moving
fast enough to make secondary crater populations. The smaller satellites, such
as Enceladus but especially Mimas, are expected to have little or no
traditional secondary populations because their escape velocities are near the
threshold velocity necessary to make a secondary crater. Our work clarifies why
the Galilean satellites have extensive secondary crater populations relative to
the Saturnian satellites. The presence, extent, and sizes of sesquinary craters
(craters formed by ejecta that escape into temporary orbits around Saturn
before re-impacting the surface) is not yet well understood. Finally, our work

the violation of the null energy condition (NEC). However, in the brane world
models, the stress energy tensor confined on the brane, threading the wormhole,
satisfies the NEC. In conventional general relativity, wormholes existing
before inflation can be significantly enlarged by the expanding spacetime. We
investigate the evolution of an inflating wormhole in the brane world scenario,
in which the wormhole is supported by the nonlocal brane world effects. As a
first step in our study we consider the possibility of embedding a
four-dimensional brane world wormhole into a five dimensional bulk. The
conditions for the embedding are obtained by studying the junction conditions
for the wormhole geometry, as well as the full set of the five dimensional bulk
field equations. For the description of the inflation we adopt the chaotic
inflation model. We study the dynamics of the brane world wormholes during the
exponential inflation stage, and in the stage of the oscillating scalar field.
A particular exact solution corresponding to a zero redshift wormhole is also
obtained. The resulting evolution shows that while the physical and geometrical
parameters of a zero redshift wormhole decay naturally, a wormhole satisfying
some very general initial conditions could turn into a black hole, and exist
forever.

However, the amplitudes of the rotation curves (at the last measured point) of
both galaxies are very similar, of about 40 km/s at a galactocentric radius of
7 kpc. This fact is challenging for modified theories of gravity that predict a
one-to-one relation between gravity at any radius and the enclosed baryonic

asymptotic flat velocity of 60 km/s in HoII. Since the baryonic mass of HoII is
dominated by the gas component, MOND overboosts its rotation speed even if the
mass of the stellar disk is taken negligibly small. We conclude the rotation
curve of HoII is probably inconsistent with MOND, unless the inclination and

radionuclide, was uniformly distributed in the nascent Solar System with the
initial Al-26/Al-27 ratio of ~5.2\times10-5, suggesting its external stellar
origin. However, the stellar source of Al-26 and the manner in which it was
injected into the solar system remain controversial: the Al-26 could have been
produced by an asymptotic giant branch star, a supernova, or a Wolf-Rayet star
and injected either into the protosolar molecular cloud or protoplanetary disk.
Corundum (Al2O3) is thermodynamically predicted to be the first condensate from
a cooling gas of solar composition. Here we show that micron-sized corundum
condensates from O-16-rich gas (Big Delta O-17 ~ -25%) of solar composition
recorded heterogeneous distribution of Al-26 at the birth of the solar system:
the inferred initial Al-26/Al-27 ratio ranges from ~6.5x10-5 to <2x10-6; ~50%
of the corundum grains measured are Al-26-poor. Other Al-26-poor, O-16-rich
refractory objects include grossite (CaAl4O7)- and hibonite(CaAl12O19)-rich
calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) in CH chondrites, platy hibonite
crystals in CM chondrites, and FUN (fractionation and unidentified nuclear
isotopic anomalies) CAIs in CV, CO, and CR chondrites. Considering the
apparently early and short duration (<0.3 Ma) of condensation of refractory
O-16-rich solids in the solar system, we infer that Al-26 was injected into the
collapsing protosolar molecular cloud and later homogenized in the
protoplanetary disk. The apparent lack of correlation between Al-26 abundance
and O-isotope compositions of corundum grains put important constraints on the
stellar source of Al-26 in the solar system.

sr^-1. The observed emission of rotationally excited OH lines is extended and
correlates well with the high-J CO and CH^+ J=3-2 line emission (but apparently
not with water vapour), pointing towards a common origin. Nonlocal, non-LTE
radiative transfer models including excitation by the ambient FIR radiation
field suggest that OH arises in a small filling factor component of warm

column densities of ~10^15 cm^-2. High density and temperature photochemical
models predict such enhanced OH columns at low depths (A_V<1) and small spatial
scales (~10^15 cm), where OH formation is driven by gas-phase endothermic
reactions of atomic oxygen with molecular hydrogen. We interpret the extended
OH emission as coming from unresolved structures exposed to far-ultraviolet
(FUV) radiation near the Bar edge (photoevaporating clumps or filaments) and
not from the lower density ""interclump"" medium. Photodissociation leads to
OH/H2O abundance ratios (>1) much higher than those expected in equally warm

adopted modern error correcting codes. The iterative decoding algorithms
required for these codes involve high computational complexity and high

processing elements (PEs). Supporting multiple heterogeneous LDPC codes on a
parallel decoder poses serious problems in the design of the interconnect
structure for such PEs. The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility of
NoC (Network on Chip) based decoders, where full flexibility in terms of
supported LDPC codes is obtained resorting to an NoC to connect PEs. NoC based
LDPC decoders have been previously considered unfeasible because of the cost
overhead associated to packet management and routing. On the contrary, the
designed NoC adopts a low complexity routing, which introduces a very limited
cost overhead with respect to architectures dedicated to specific classes of
codes. Moreover the paper proposes an efficient configuration technique, which
allows for fast on--the--fly switching among different codes. The decoder
architecture is scalable and VLSI synthesis results are presented for several
cases of study, including the whole set of WiMAX LDPC codes, WiFi codes and

puts aside restrictive assumptions that are source of confusion. Similar
observations apply to the ideal-gas law. In the absence of gravity, when a
cylinder terminated by a piston, containing a single corpuscle and with height
$h$ has temperature $\theta$, the average force that the corpuscle exerts on
the piston is: $\ave{F}=\theta/h$. This law is valid at any temperature, except
at very low temperatures when quantum effects are significant and at very high
temperatures because the corpuscle may then split into smaller parts. It is
usually derived under the assumption that the temperature is proportional to
the corpuscle kinetic energy, or else, from a form of the quantum theory. In
contradistinction, we show that it follows solely from the postulate this it is
independent of the law of corpuscle motion. On the physical side we employ only
the concept of potential energy. A consistent picture is offered leading to the
barometric law when $w\,h\gg\theta$, and to the usual ideal-gas law when
$w\,h\ll\theta$. The mathematics is elementary. The present paper should
accordingly facilitate the understanding of the physical meaning of the
barometric and ideal-gas laws.

assumption that their evolution is influenced by the magnetized winds. Initial
periods of 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 d were considered. For each period three values of
1.3, 1.1 and 0.9 solar mass were taken as the initial masses of the more
massive components. Here the results of the computations of the first
evolutionary phase are presented, which starts from the initial conditions and
ends when the more massive component reaches its critical Roche lobe. In all
considered cases this phase lasts for several Gyr. For binaries with the higher
total mass and/or longer initial periods this time is equal to, or longer than
the main sequence life time of the more massive component. For the remaining
binaries it amounts to a substantial fraction of this life time. From the
statistical analysis of models, the predicted period distribution of detached
binaries with periods shorter than 2 d was obtained and compared to the
observed distribution from the ASAS data. An excellent agreement was obtained
under the assumption that the period distribution in this range is determined
solely by the mass and angular momentum loss due to the magnetized winds. This
result indicates, in particular, that virtually all cool detached binaries with
periods of a few tenths of a day, believed to be the immediate progenitors of W
UMa-type stars, were formed from detached systems with periods around 2-3 d and
that magnetic braking is the dominant formation mechanism of cool contact
binaries. It operates on the time scale of several Gyr rendering them rather
old, with age of 6-10 Gyr. The results of the present analysis will be used as
input data to investigate the subsequent evolution of the binaries, through the
mass exchange phase and contact or semi-detached configuration till the
ultimate merging of the components.

the assumption that finite temperature effects on defect energies and barriers
are small. In some materials, however, the stable crystal structre of interest
is mechanically unstable at 0K. In such cases, alternate approaches are needed.
Here we present results of first principles calculations of austenitic iron

magnetism to be the antiferromagnetic double-layer (AFM-d) which is both stable
and lower in energy than other possible models for the low temperature limit of
paramagnetic fcc iron. We then consider the energetics of dissolving typical
alloying impurities (Ni, Cr) in the materials, and their interaction with point
defects typical of the irradiated environment. We show that using standard
methods there is a very strong dependence of calculated defect formation
energies on the reference state chosen. Furthermore, there is a correlation
between local free volume magnetism and energetics. The effect of
substitutional Ni and Cr on defect properties is weak, rarely more than tenths

significant effect on the radiation damage in austenitic iron at high

systematically trace back rewrite sequences modulo equational axioms (such as

simplifies the traces by detecting control and data dependencies, and dropping

the CN2-profiles obtained with a generalized scidar from 41 nights are used to
calibrate and quantify the model's ability to reconstruct the optical
turbulence. The measurements are distributed over different periods of the
year, permitting us to study the model's performance in different seasons. A
statistical analysis of the simulations is performed for all the most important
astroclimatic parameters: the CN2-profiles, the seeing {\epsilon}, the
isoplanatic angle {\theta}0 and the wavefront coherence time {\tau}0. The model
shows a general good ability in reconstructing the morphology of the optical
turbulence (the shape of the vertical distribution of CN2) as well as the
strength of all the integrated astroclimatic parameters. The relative error
(with respect to measurements) of the averaged seeing on the whole atmosphere
for the whole sample of 41 nights is within 9.0 %. The median value of the
relative error night by night is equal to 18.7 %, so that the model still
maintains very good performances. Comparable percentages are observed in
partial vertical slabs (free atmosphere and boundary layer) and in different
seasons (summer and winter). We prove that the most urgent problem, at present,
is to increase the ability of the model in reconstructing very weak and very
strong turbulence conditions in the high atmosphere. This mainly affects the
model's performances for the isoplanatic angle predictions, for which the
median value of the relative error night by night is equal to 35.1 %. No major
problems are observed for the other astroclimatic parameters. A variant to the
standard calibration method is tested but we find that it does not provide
better results, confirming the solid base of the standard method.

string landscape. Since there are a large number of metastable de Sitter vacua
in string landscape, tunneling transitions to lower metastable vacua through
the bubble nucleation occur quite naturally. Although the deviation of Omega_0
from unity is small by the observational bound, we argue that the effect of
this small deviation on the large angle CMB anisotropies can be significant for
tensor-type perturbation in open inflation scenario. We consider the situation
in which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum
tunneling and that of the slow-roll inflation in the nucleated bubble. If the
potential just after tunneling is steep enough, a rapid-roll phase appears
before the slow-roll inflation. In this case the power spectrum is basically
determined by the Hubble rate during the slow-roll inflation. If such
rapid-roll phase is absent, the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high
energy density there in the large angular components. The amplitude of large
angular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation
mode if the bubble wall tension is small. Therefore, one can construct some
models in which the deviation of Omega_0 from unity is large enough to produce
measurable effects. We also consider a more general class of models, where the
false vacuum decay may occur due to Hawking-Moss tunneling, as well as the
models involving more than one scalar field. We discuss scalar perturbations in
these models and point out that a large set of such models is already ruled out
by observational data, unless there was a very long stage of slow-roll
inflation after the tunneling. These results show that observational data allow
us to test various assumptions concerning the structure of the string theory
potentials and the duration of the last stage of inflation.

the complementary open 0-1 polytope $\Delta^+_\textsc{ctf}(G,\epsilon)$, and

and the same is likely to be true in other astrophysical environments. Recent
studies suggest that reconnection at such 3D nulls may play an important role
in the coronal dynamics. In this paper the properties of the torsional spine
and torsional fan modes of magnetic reconnection at 3D nulls are investigated.
New analytical models are developed, which for the first time include a current
layer that is spatially localised around the null, extending along either the
spine or the fan of the null. These are complemented with numerical
simulations. The principal aim is to investigate the effect of varying the
degree of asymmetry of the null point magnetic field on the resulting
reconnection process - where previous studies always considered a non-generic
radially symmetric null. The geometry of the current layers within which
torsional spine and torsional fan reconnection occur is found to be strongly
dependent on the symmetry of the magnetic field. Torsional spine reconnection
still occurs in a narrow tube around the spine, but with elliptical
cross-section when the fan eigenvalues are different, and with the short axis
of the ellipse being along the strong field direction. The spatiotemporal peak
current, and the peak reconnection rate attained, are found not to depend
strongly on the degree of asymmetry. For torsional fan reconnection, the
reconnection occurs in a planar disk in the fan surface, which is again
elliptical when the symmetry of the magnetic field is broken. The short axis of
the ellipse is along the weak field direction, with the current being peaked in
these weak field regions. The peak current and peak reconnection rate in this
case are clearly dependent on the asymmetry, with the peak current increasing
but the reconnection rate decreasing as the degree of asymmetry is increased.

performance guarantee of these algorithms is well understood, but the
worst-case lower bounds seem somewhat contrived and it is questionable if they

study the algorithms in the framework of smoothed analysis, in which instances

  While the lower bounds for all scheduling variants with restricted machines
are rather robust, we find out that the bounds are fragile for unrestricted

jump and the lex-jump algorithm are (in contrast to the worst case) independent
of the number of machines. They are Theta(phi) and Theta(log(phi)),
respectively, where 1/phi is a parameter measuring the magnitude of the

anarchy is Theta(log(phi)) for routing games on parallel links. Additionally we
show that for unrestricted machines also the greedy list scheduling algorithm

non-thermal radio maps and compare them with observations of the SN1006

a model with quasi-parallel injection efficiency, a magnetic field aspect angle
of $38^\circ\pm 4^\circ$ with the line of sight, and a gradient of the field
strength toward the galactic plane, higher then the expected variations of the
large scale field of the Galaxy. We conclude that the radio limbs of SN1006 are

explaining the $W+$dijet excess by colored scalar bosons. There are several
colored scalars which can have tree level renormalizable Yukawa couplings with
two quarks, $({\bf 8}, {\bf 2},1/2)$, $(\bar{\bf 6}({\bf 3}), {\bf 3}({\bf 1}),

cross section and mass put constraints on model parameters and rule out some
possible scenarios when confronted with other existing data, in particular FCNC
data, we find that there are strong constraints on the Yukawa couplings of
these scalars. Without forcing the couplings to be some special texture forms
most of the scalars, except the $({\bf 3}, {\bf 3}, -1/3)$, are in trouble with

Keplerian orbits with non zero eccentricities and a satellite branch, where the
gravitational interaction between the two planets dominates the attraction from
the star and the two planets form a close binary which revolves around the
star. The stability regions around periodic orbits along the family are
studied. Next, we study the dynamical evolution in time of a planetary system
with two planets which is initially trapped in a stable 1/1 resonant periodic
motion, when a drag force is included in the system. We prove that if we start
with a 1/1 resonant planetary system with large eccentricities, the system
migrates, due to the drag force, {\it along the family of periodic orbits} and
is finally trapped in a satellite orbit. This, in principle, provides a
mechanism for the generation of a satellite system: we start with a planetary

simultaneously in X-ray, UV, and optical by XMM-Newton on days 22.9 and 34.9
after outburst. Two full passages of the companion in front of the nova ejecta
were observed, witnessing the reformation of the accretion disk. On day 22.9,
we observed smooth eclipses in UV and optical but deep dips in the X-ray light
curve which disappeared by day 34.9, then yielding clean eclipses in all bands.
X-ray dips can be caused by clumpy absorbing material that intersects the line
of sight while moving along highly elliptical trajectories. Cold material from
the companion could explain the absence of dips in UV and optical light. The
disappearance of X-ray dips before day 34.9 implies significant progress in the
formation of the disk. The X-ray spectra contain photospheric continuum
emission plus strong emission lines, but no clear absorption lines. Both
continuum and emission lines in the X-ray spectra indicate a temperature
increase from day 22.9 to day 34.9. We find clear evidence in the spectra and
light curves for Thompson scattering of the photospheric emission from the
white dwarf. Photospheric absorption lines can be smeared out during scattering
in a plasma of fast electrons. We also find spectral signatures of resonant
line scattering that lead to the observation of the strong emission lines.
Their dominance could be a general phenomenon in high-inclination systems such
as Cal87.

X-ray transient. On 2010 October 28, the source displayed a second X-ray
outburst and a 2 months-long monitoring with Swift was carried out to follow
the evolution of the source X-ray flux during the event. We report on the
INTEGRAL and Swift observations of the second X-ray outburst observed from
IGRJ19294+1816. We detected pulsations in the X-ray emission from the source at
\sim12.5 s up to 50 keV. The source X-ray flux decreased smoothly during the
two months of observation displaying only marginal spectral changes. Due to the
relatively rapid decay of the source X-ray flux, no significant variations of
the source spin period across the event could be measured. This prevented a
firm confirmation of the previously suggested orbital period of the source at
117 d. This periodicity was also searched by using archival Swift /BAT data. We
detected a marginally significant peak in the periodogram and determined the
best period at 116.2\pm0.6 days (estimated chance probability of a spurious
detection 1%). The smooth decline of the source X-ray flux across the two
months of observations after the onset of the second outburst, together with
its relatively low value of the spin period and the absence of remarkable
changes in the spectral parameters (i.e., the absorption column density),
suggests that IGRJ19294+1816 is most likely another member of the Be X-ray
binaries discovered by INTEGRAL and not a supergiant fast X-ray transient.

properties of the phase shows that the excitations behave like a scalar
solitonic free particles. By comparing the free energy of the pion gradient
phase to the competing multiquark-pion gradient (MQ-$\mathcal{5}\phi$) phase,
it becomes apparent that the pure pion gradient is less thermodynamically
preferred than the MQ-$\mathcal{5}\phi$ phase. However, in the parameter space
where the baryonic chemical potential is smaller than the onset value of the
multiquark, the dominating magnetized nuclear matter is the pion gradient
phase.

diode, this has been achieved by spontaneous decay of excited atomic levels.
For an atomic condensate, it is clear, however, that such decay will cause both
heating and decoherence of the condensate. To overcome this complication we
introduce a different setup where the dissipation does not act directly on the

exciting a cavity mode, which in return decays to the vacuum via photon losses.
The efficiency of the method utilizing experimental parameters is shown to be

$\delta_{2g}$ for symplectic lattices in even dimensions ($g=2n$) by applying a
mean-value argument from the geometry of numbers to a subset of symmetric
lattices. Here we obtain only a slight improvement. However, we believe that
the method applied has further potential. In section 2 we present new families
of highly symmetric (symplectic) lattices, which occur in dimensions of powers
of two. Here the lattices in dimension $2^n$ are constructed with the help of a
multiplicative matrix group isomorphic to $({\Z_2}^n,+)$. We furthermore show
the connection of these lattices with the circulant matrices and the
Barnes-Wall lattices.

Keeping only the first two Gegenbauer coefficients $a_2$ and $a_4$, we show
that the $1\sigma$ error ellipse of all data up to 9 GeV$^2$ greatly overlaps
with the set of pion distribution amplitudes obtained from nonlocal QCD sum
rules---within the range of uncertainties due to twist-four. This remains valid
also for the projection of the $1\sigma$ error ellipsoid on the $(a_2,a_4)$
plane when including $a_6$. We argue that it is not possible to accommodate the
high-$Q^2$ tail of the BaBar data with the same accuracy, despite opposite
claims by other authors, and conclude that the BaBar data still pose a
challenge to QCD.

interaction graph and of slow divergence of reciprocal interaction weights.
Persistent connectivity can be considered as the counterpart of the notion of
ultimate connectivity used in discrete- time consensus protocols. Slow
divergence of reciprocal interaction weights generalizes the assumption of
cut-balanced interactions. We show that under these two assumptions, the
continuous-time consensus protocol succeeds: the states of all the agents
converge asymptotically to a common value. Moreover, our proof allows us to
give an estimate of the rate of convergence towards the consensus. We also
provide two examples that make us think that both of our assumptions are tight.

a clear signature of the coexistence of superconducting transition (Tc = 5.5 K)
with SDW ordering in our under doped sample viz. x = 0.15. The spin density
wave transition observed in EuFe2As2 get completely suppressed at x = 0.3 and
superconductivity arises below 20 K. Superconducting transition temperature Tc
increases with increase in K content and a maximum Tc = 33 K is reached for x =
0.5, beyond which it decreases again. The doping dependent T(x) phase diagram
is extracted from the magnetic and electrical transport data. It is found that
magnetic ordering of Eu-moments coexists with superconductivity up to x = 0.6.
The isothermal magnetization data taken at 2 K for the doped samples suggest 2+
valence states of Eu ions. We also present the temperature dependence of the
lower critical field Hc1 of superconducting polycrystalline samples. The value
of Hc1(0) obtained for x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 after taking the demagnetization

not show exponential behaviour at low temperature, as would be expected for a
fully gapped clean s-wave superconductor. In contrast, it shows a T2 power-law

As a representative example, using the first principles calculations, the
recently discovered giant bulk Rashba splitting system BiTeI is shown to fully

correct crystal structure of BiTeI, different from what has been believed thus
far, the third criterion is demonstrated to be met by a negative crystal field

pair is considered. Intermediate nodes in the network employ an
amplify-and-forward scheme to relay their input signals. In this case the
overall input-output channel from the source via the relays to the destination
effectively behaves as an intersymbol interference channel with colored noise.
Unlike previous work we formulate the problem of the maximum achievable rate in
this setting as an optimization problem with no assumption on the network size,
topology, and received signal-to-noise ratio. Previous work considered only
scenarios wherein relays use all their power to amplify their received signals.
We demonstrate that this may not always maximize the maximal achievable rate in
amplify-and-forward relay networks. The proposed formulation allows us to not
only recover known results on the performance of the amplify-and-forward
schemes for some simple relay networks but also characterize the performance of
more complex amplify-and-forward relay networks which cannot be addressed in a
straightforward manner using existing approaches.
  Using cut-set arguments, we derive simple upper bounds on the capacity of
general wireless relay networks. Through various examples, we show that a large
class of amplify-and-forward relay networks can achieve rates within a constant
factor of these upper bounds asymptotically in network parameters.

to flow with a constant flux rate. Stresses applied to a droplet from its
neighbors deform the droplet outline, and this deformation is quantified to
provide an ad hoc measure of the stress. As the sample flows through the hopper
we see large fluctuations of the stress, similar in character to what has been
seen in other flows of complex fluids. Periods of time with large decreases in
stress are correlated with bursts of elementary rearrangement events (""T1
events"" where four droplets rearrange). More specifically, we see a local
relationship between these observations: a T1 event decreases the inter-droplet
forces up to 3 droplet diameters away from the event. This directly connects
microscopic structural changes to macroscopic fluctuations, and confirms
theoretical pictures of local rearrangements influencing nearby regions. These
local rearrangements are an important means of reducing and redistributing
stresses within a flowing material.
