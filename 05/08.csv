  Updated language",,,,"math.CO math.AT math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The topological Tverberg theorem has been generalized in several directions
by setting extra restrictions on the Tverberg partitions.
  Restricted Tverberg partitions, defined by the idea that certain points
cannot be in the same part, are encoded with graphs. When two points are
adjacent in the graph, they are not in the same part. If the restrictions are
too harsh, then the topological Tverberg theorem fails. The colored Tverberg
theorem corresponds to graphs constructed as disjoint unions of small complete
graphs. Hell studied the case of paths and cycles.
  In graph theory these partitions are usually viewed as graph colorings. As
explored by Aharoni, Haxell, Meshulam and others there are fundamental
connections between several notions of graph colorings and topological
combinatorics.
  For ordinary graph colorings it is enough to require that the number of
colors q satisfy q>Delta, where Delta is the maximal degree of the graph. It
was proven by the first author using equivariant topology that if q>\Delta^2
then the topological Tverberg theorem still works. It is conjectured that
q>K\Delta is also enough for some constant K, and in this paper we prove a
fixed-parameter version of that conjecture.
  The required topological connectivity results are proven with shellability,
which also strengthens some previous partial results where the topological
connectivity was proven with the nerve lemma.

is a powerful mean of studying the evolution of galaxies and large-scale
structures. These anisotropies have been measured by a number of experiments,
from the far-infrared to the millimeter. One of the main impediments to an
accurate measurement on large scales is the contamination of the foreground
signal by Galactic dust emission. Our goal is to show that we can remove the
Galactic cirrus contamination using HI data, and thus accurately measure the
clustering of starburst galaxies in the CIB. We use observations of the ELAIS
N1 field at far-infrared (100 and 160{\mu}m) and radio (21 cm) wavelengths. We
compute the correlation between dust emission, traced by far-infrared
observations, and HI gas traced by 21cm observations, and derive dust
emissivities that enable us to subtract the cirrus emission from the
far-infrared maps. We then derive the power spectrum of the CIB anisotropies,
as well as its mean level at 100{\mu}m and 160{\mu}m. We also combine the HI
data and Spitzer total power mode absolute measurements to determine the CIB
mean level at 160{\mu}m. We find B160=0.77\pm0.04\pm0.12MJy/sr,where the first
error is statistical and the second systematic. Combining this measurement with
the B100/B160 color of the correlated anisotropies, we also derive the CIB mean
at 100 {\mu}m, B100=0.24\pm0.08\pm0.04 MJy/sr. This measurement is in line with
values obtained with recent models of infrared galaxy evolution and
Herschel/PACS data, but is much smaller than the previous DIRBE measurements.
The use of high-angular resolution Hi data is mandatory to accurately
differentiate the cirrus from the CIB emission. The 100 {\mu}m IRAS map (and
thus the map developed by Schlegel and collaborators) in such extragalactic
fields is highly contaminated by the CIB anisotropies and hence cannot be used
as a Galactic cirrus tracer.

suggest an algorithmic way to tackle the problem of constructing reliable and

Theorem, in weakly chaotic regimes associated with the excitation of the first

($E=0.19$), when the $k=1$ linear mode is excited, chaotic diffusion occurs
characterized by distributions that are well approximated for long times
($t>10^9$) by a $q$-Gaussian Quasi-Stationary State (QSS) with $q\approx1.4$.
On the other hand, when the $k=N$ mode is excited at the same energy, diffusive
phenomena are \textit{absent} and the motion is quasi-periodic. In fact, as the
energy increases to $E=0.3$, the distributions in the former case pass through
\textit{shorter} $q$-Gaussian states and tend rapidly to a Gaussian (i.e.
$q\rightarrow 1$) where equipartition sets in, while in the latter we need to
reach to E=4 to see a \textit{sudden transition} to Gaussian statistics,
without any passage through an intermediate QSS. This may be explained by
different energy localization properties and recurrence phenomena in the two
cases, supporting the view that when the energy is placed in the first mode
weak chaos and ""sticky"" dynamics lead to a more gradual process of energy
sharing, while strong chaos and equipartition appear abruptly when only the
last mode is initially excited.

finite element approximations for quasi-linear second order elliptic equations.
The results are extensions of the classical maximum principles in the theory of
partial differential equations to finite element methods. The mathematical
tools are based on the variational approach that was commonly used in the
classical PDE theory. The discrete maximum principles are established by
assuming a property on the discrete variational form that is of global nature.
In particular, the assumption on the variational form is verified when the
finite element partition satisfies some angle conditions. For the general
quasi-linear elliptic equation, these angle conditions indicate that each
triangle or tetrahedron needs to be $\mathcal{O}(h^\alpha)$-acute in the sense
that each angle $\alpha_{ij}$ (for triangle) or interior dihedral angle
$\alpha_{ij}$ (for tetrahedron) must satisfy $\alpha_{ij}\le \pi/2-\gamma
h^\alpha$ for some $\alpha\ge 0$ and $\gamma>0$. For the Poisson problem where
the differential operator is given by Laplacian, the angle requirement is the
same as the existing ones: either all the triangles are non-obtuse or each
interior edge is non-negative. It should be pointed out that the analytical
tools used in this paper are based on the powerful De Giorgi's iterative method
that has played important roles in the theory of partial differential
equations. The mathematical analysis itself is of independent interest in the
finite element analysis.

prediction norm. In order to cover heteroscedastic non-Gaussian noise, we rely
on moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums to achieve Gaussian-like
results under weak conditions. Moreover, we derive bounds on the performance of
ordinary least square (ols) applied to the model selected by $\sqrt{\mathrm
{Lasso}}$ accounting for possible misspecification of the selected model. Under
mild conditions, the rate of convergence of ols post $\sqrt{\mathrm {Lasso}}$
is as good as $\sqrt{\mathrm {Lasso}}$'s rate. As an application, we consider
the use of $\sqrt{\mathrm {Lasso}}$ and ols post $\sqrt{\mathrm {Lasso}}$ as
estimators of nuisance parameters in a generic semiparametric problem
(nonlinear moment condition or $Z$-problem), resulting in a construction of
$\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of the main
parameters.

wind nor Be wind, taking into account only the gravitational effect of the
pulsar on the Be disk. In this simulation, the gas particles are ejected at a
constant rate from the equatorial surface of the Be star, which is tilted in a
direction consistent with multi-waveband observations. We run the simulation
until the Be disk is fully developed and starts to repeat a regular tidal
interaction with the pulsar. Then, we turn on the pulsar wind and the Be wind.
We run two simulations with different wind mass-loss rates for the Be star, one
for a B2V type and the other for a significantly earlier spectral type.
Although the global shape of the interaction surface between the pulsar wind
and the Be wind agrees with the analytical solution, the effect of the pulsar
wind on the Be disk is profound. The pulsar wind strips off an outer part of
the Be disk, truncating the disk at a radius significantly smaller than the
pulsar orbit. Our results, therefore, rule out the idea that the pulsar passes
through the Be disk around periastron, which has been assumed in the previous
studies. It also turns out that the location of the contact discontinuity can
be significantly different between phases when the pulsar wind directly hits
the Be disk and those when the pulsar wind collides with the Be wind. It is
thus important to adequately take into account the circumstellar environment of
the Be star, in order to construct a satisfactory model for this prototypical
TeV binary.

While conventional path metrics depend only on symbols on a visited path, the
new path metric accounts for unvisited parts of the tree in advance through an
unconstrained linear estimator and adds a bias term that reflects the
contribution of as-yet undecided symbols. By applying the linear estimate-based
look-ahead path metric to an M-algorithm that selects the best M paths for each
level of the tree we develop a new soft-input soft-output tree detector, called
an improved soft-input soft-output M-algorithm (ISS-MA). Based on an analysis
of the probability of correct path loss, we show that the improved path metric
offers substantial performance gain over the conventional path metric. We also
demonstrate through simulations that the ISS-MA provides a better
performance-complexity trade-off than existing soft-input soft-output detection

through growth of many spatial clusters, and where invasion can occur only as a
single-cluster process. In the multi-cluster invasion regime, rapid
environmental variation produced spatial mixing of the species and
non-equilibrium coexistence. The dynamics' dominant response effectively
averaged environmental fluctuation, so that each species could avoid
competitive exclusion. Increasing the environment's half-period to match the
population-dynamic timescale let the (initially) more abundant resident
repeatedly repel the invader. Periodic transition in propagation-rate advantage
rarely interrupted the exclusion process when the more abundant species had
competitive advantage. However, at infrequent and randomly occurring times, the
rare species could invade and reverse the density pattern by rapidly eroding
the resident's preemption of space. In the single-cluster invasion regime,
environmental variation occurring faster than the population-dynamic timescale
prohibited successful invasion; the first species to reach its stationary
density (calculated for a constant environment) continued to repel the other
during long simulations. When the endogenous and exogenous timescales matched,
the species randomly reversed roles of resident and invader; the waiting times
for reversal of abundances indicate stochastic resonance. For both invasion
regimes, environmental fluctuation occurring much slower than the endogenous

quantum interference among independent sources. To understand the effect of

pump or individual signal (idler) beam. In the first one, based on spontaneous
four wave mixing in a piece of optical fiber, the intensity correlation
function of the filtered individual signal beam, which characterizes the degree
of temporal coherence, is measured as a function of the chirp of pump. The
results demonstrate that the chirp of pump pulses decreases the degree of
temporal coherence. In the second one, a Hong-Ou-Mandel type two-photon
interference experiment with the signal beams generated in two different fibers
is carried out. The results illustrate that the chirp of individual beam does
not change the temporal coherence degree, but affect the temporal mode
matching. To achieve high visibility, apart from improving the coherence degree
by minimizing the chirp of pump, mode matching should be optimized by managing
the chirps of individual beams.

to standard GRB models. We argue that both these observations may have an
explanation within the unified framework of a Quark-Nova occurring in a
low-mass X-ray binary (neutron star- white dwarf). For LMXBs where the binary
separation is sufficiently tight, ejecta from the exploding Neutron Star
triggers nuclear burning in the white dwarf on impact, possibly leading to
Fe-rich composition compact white dwarfs with mass 0.43M_sun < M_WD <
0.72M_sun, reminiscent of G87-7. Our results rely on the assumption, which
ultimately needs to be tested by hydrodynamic and nucleosynthesis simulations,
that under certain circumstances the WD can avoid the thermonuclear runaway.
For heavier white dwarfs (i.e. M_WD > 0.72M_sun) experiencing the QN shock,
degeneracy will not be lifted when Carbon burning begins, and a
sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia Supernovae may result in our model. Under slightly

three-level superconducting qubit systems in cavity QED. The two logical states
of a qubit are represented by the two lowest levels of each system while a
higher-energy level is used for the gate implementation. The method operates
essentially by preparing a $W$ state conditioned on the states of the control
qubits, creating a single photon in the cavity mode, and then performing an
arbitrary rotation on the states of the target qubit with assistance of the
cavity photon. It is interesting to note that the basic operational steps for
implementing the proposed gate do not increase with the number $n$ of qubits,
and the gate operation time decreases as the number of qubits increases. This
proposal is quite general, which can be applied to various types of
superconducting devices in a cavity or coupled to a resonator.

admixture of ca. 10 % vol. of inert gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr or N2 to either
isotope prior to its contact with palladium powder. The oscillations are
represented in a form of calorimetric time series, recorded using gas
flow-through microcalorimeter at the temperatures of 75 {\deg}C for D2 and 106
{\deg}C for H2. For both D2 and H2, the oscillation parameters changes as a
function of the kind of inert gas used: the amplitude increases and the
frequency decreases in passing from He to Kr. An empirical dependence of the
oscillation frequencies observed for various admixtures and normalized with
respect to Kr has been found. Accordingly, the frequency is a function of a
product of the first ionization potential and the square root of atomic mass of
the inert gas (He, Ne, Ar, Kr or N2). On the other hand, invariance of the
thermal effects of sorption is evident from the integrated areas under the
calorimetric time series yielding the molar heats of sorption conserved,
irrespective of the inert gas admixture. A novel calibration procedure has been
devised in order to deal with an instability of calibration factor arising in
desorption of H2 and D2 from Pd. A concept of dynamic calibration factor made
it possible to obtain a good agreement between the heats of sorption and
desorption of both H2 and D2 within individual sorption-desorption cycles for

quadrature and importance sampling and established that, in the case of random

importance sampling under mild conditions. The variational sampling
implementation presented in this paper requires a rough initial approximation
to the target distribution, which may be found, e.g. using the Laplace method,
and is shown to then have the potential to substantially improve over several
existing approximate inference techniques to estimate moments of order up to

enables seamless mobility. The interworking of radio resource management,
access selection and mobility management is defined in a generic and modular
way, which is extensible for future protocols and standards.

and proposed in various research projects and standardization bodies. With the
continuing deployment of different access networks, the wider range of
applications tailored for a mobile environment, and a larger diversity of
wireless end systems, it emerged that a single mobility protocol (such as
Mobile IP) is not sufficient to handle the different requirements adequately.
Thus a solution is needed to manage multiple mobility protocols in end systems
and network nodes, to detect and select the required protocols, versions and
optional features, and enable control on running daemons. For this purpose a
mobility toolbox has been developed as part of the EU funded Ambient Networks
project. This paper describes this modular management approach and illustrates
the additional benefits a mobility protocol can gain by using state transfer as
an example.

that achieve the largest possible value of minimum distance ratio also achieve
the smallest possible mean square error (MSE). Based on this achievability, a

chemical enrichment history of this cluster, in which two stellar groups are
characterized by a different content in iron, neutron capture elements Y, Zr
and Ba, and alpha element Ca. The principal results of this study are: (i)
substantial star-to-star metallicity scatter (-2.0<[Fe/H]<-1.6); (ii)
enhancement of s-process/r-process neutron-capture abundance ratios in a
fraction of giants, positively correlated with metallicity; (iii) sharp
separation between the s-process rich and s-process poor groups by [La/Eu]
ratio; (iv) possible increase of [Cu/Fe] ratios with increasing [Fe/H],
suggesting that this element also has a significant s-process component; and
(v) presence of Na-O and C-N anticorrelations in both the stellar groups.

says that almost third derivative is locally integrable. Up to now, only second
derivative $\nabla^2 u$ has been known to be locally integrable by standard

$\alpha\geq 3$ as long as $u$ is smooth. The proof uses a good approximation of

the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras, the most prominent

the cluster-additive ones. We conjecture that the cluster-additive functions on
