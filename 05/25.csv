characterize the evolution of quantum systems, a task of crucial importance.
However, their complexity dramatically increases with the size of the system.
Here we present the theory describing a new type of method for quantum process
tomography. We describe an algorithm that can be used to selectively estimate
any parameter characterizing a quantum process. Unlike any of its predecessors
this new quantum tomographer combines two main virtues: it requires investing a
number of physical resources scaling polynomially with the number of qubits and
at the same time it does not require any ancillary resources. We present the
results of the first photonic implementation of this quantum device,
characterizing quantum processes affecting two qubits encoded in heralded
single photons. Even for this small system our method displays clear advantages
over the other existing ones.

  the galactic bulge","Submitted to A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201117282",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lunar occultations (LO) provide a unique combination of high angular
resolution and sensitivity at near-infrared wavelenghts. At the ESO Very Large
Telescope, it is possible to achieve about 1 milliarcsecond (mas) resolution
and detect sources as faint as K$\approx$12\,mag.
  We have taken advantage of a passage of the Moon over two crowded and
reddened regions in the direction of the inner part of the galactic bulge, in
order to obtain a high number of occultation light curves over two half nights.
Our goal was to detect and characterize new binary systems, and to investigate
highly extincted and relatively unknown infrared sources in search of
circumstellar shells and similar peculiarities. Our target list included a
significant number of very late-type stars, but in fact the majority of the
sources was without spectral classification.
  A LO event requires the sampling of the light curve at millisecond rates in
order to permit a detailed study of the diffraction fringes. For this, we used
the so-called burst mode of the ISAAC instrument at the Melipal telescope. Our
observing efficiency was ultimately limited by overheads for telescope pointing
and data storage, to about one event every three minutes.
  We could record useful light curves for 184 sources. Of these, 24 were found
to be binaries or multiples, all previously unknown. The projected separations
are as small as 7.5\,mas, and the magnitude differences as high as
$\Delta$K=6.5\,mag. Additionally we could establish, also for the first time,
the resolved nature of at least two more stars, with indication of
circumstellar emission. We could also put upper limits on the angular size of
about 165 unresolved stars, an information that combined with previous and
future observations will be very helpful in establishing a list of reliable
calibrators for long baseline interferometers.

protoplanetary disks and solar system comets. Being absent in the interstellar
medium, it must be produced during the disk lifetime. It can therefore serve as
a tracer of dust processing and disk evolution, which can lead to a better
understanding of the physical processes occurring in the disk, and possibly
planet formation. However, the connection of these processes with the overall
disk crystallinity remains unclear. We aim to characterize the forsterite
abundance and spatial distribution in the disk of the Herbig Be star HD 100546,
to investigate if a connection exists with the large disk gap. We use a 2D
radiative transfer code, MCMax, to model the circumstellar dust around HD
100546. We use VISIR Q-band imaging to probe the outer disk geometry and
mid-infrared features to model the spatial distribution of forsterite. The
temperature-dependent shape of the 69 micron feature observed with Herschel
PACS is used as a critical tool to constrain this distribution. We find a
crystalline mass fraction of 40 - 60 %, located close to the disk wall between
13 and 20 AU, and possibly farther out at the disk surface. The forsterite is
in thermal contact with the other dust species. We put an upper limit on the
iron content of forsterite of 0.3 %. Optical depth effects play a key role in
explaining the observed forsterite features, hiding warm forsterite from view
at short wavelengths. The disk wall acts as a showcase: it displays a localized
high abundance of forsterite, which gives rise to a high observed
crystallinity, while the overall mass fraction of forsterite is a factor of ten
lower.

be stopped. The accretion will recover after the gas cools down. This results
in the oscillation of the black hole activity. In this paper we show that this
mechanism is the origin of the intermittent activity of some compact young
radio sources. Such intermittency is required to explain the population of
these sources. We calculate the timescales of the black hole oscillation and

$z\gsim1$. This allows us to study the possibility to differentiate between
different DE alternatives using wide and deep surveys like Euclid, which will
measure both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for several hundreds of
millions of galaxies up to redshift $z\simeq 2$. We do a Fisher matrix analysis
for the prospects of differentiating among the different DE models in terms of
the growth index, taken as a given function of redshift or with a principal
component analysis, with a value for each redshift bin for a Euclid-like

$P(k)$, one can reach (2%, 5%) errors in $(w_0, w_a)$, and (4%, 12%) errors in
$(\gamma_0, \gamma_a)$, while using WL we get errors at least twice as large.

These are the field equivalents of the mass, rest energy, and velocity of a
relativistic particle. Thus R and I are Lorentz-invariant and |v|<=c, with
equality if and only if R=0. The exceptional fields with |v|=c were called
""coherent"" because their energy moves in complete harmony with the field,
leaving no inertia or reactive energy behind. Generic electromagnetic fields
become coherent only in the far zone. Elsewhere, their energy flows at speeds
|v|<c. The purpose of this paper is to confirm and clarify this statement by
studying the local energy flow in several common systems: a time-harmonic
electric dipole field, a time-dependent electric dipole field, and a standing
plane wave. For these fields, the energy current (Poynting vector) is too weak
to carry away all of the energy, thus leaving reactive energy in its wake. For
the time-dependent dipole field, we find that the energy can flow both
transversally and inwards, back to the source. Neither of these phenomena show
up in the usual computation of the energy transport velocity which considers
only averages over one period in the time-harmonic case.

wave (GW) sources for the GW detector LISA, with more than 10^4 binaries
expected to be detected over the mission's lifetime. Part of this population is
expected to be eccentric, and here we investigate the potential for
constraining the white dwarf (WD) properties through apsidal precession in
these binaries. We analyze the tidal, rotational, and general relativistic
contributions to apsidal precession by using detailed He WD models, where the
evolution of the star's interior is followed throughout the cooling phase. In
agreement with previous studies of zero-temperature WDs, we find that apsidal
precession in eccentric DWDs can lead to a detectable shift in the emitted GW
signal when binaries with cool (old) components are considered. This shift
increases significantly for hot (young) WDs. We find that apsidal motion in hot
(cool) DWDs is dominated by tides at orbital frequencies above ~10^{-4}Hz
(10^{- 3}$Hz). The analysis of apsidal precession in these sources while
ignoring the tidal component would lead to an extreme bias in the mass
determination, and could lead us to misidentify WDs as neutron stars or black
holes. We use the detailed WD models to show that for older, cold WDs, there is
a unique relationship that ties the radius and apsidal precession constant to
the WD masses, therefore allowing tides to be used as a tool to constrain the
source masses.

distributions of work. In molecular dynamics simulations, the traditional way
of constructing work distributions is to perform as many pulling simulations as
possible. But reliable work distributions are not always produced in a finite
number of simulations. The computational cost of using JE is not less than
other commonly used methods such as Thermodynamic Integration and Umbrella
Sampling methods. Here we first show a different proof of JE based on the idea
of step-wise pulling procedures that is efficient in computing free energies by
using JE. The key point in our proof is that the processes of turning-on/off a
harmonic potential to perform work are described by double Heaviside functions
of time. We then show that the distributions of work performed by the potential
can be easily generated from the distributions of a reaction coordinate along a
pathway. Based on the proof, we propose sequential and parallel step-wise
pulling protocols for generating work distributions that require suitable
relaxation time at each pulling step. The criterion for reliable work
distributions is that there must be sufficient mutual overlaps between the
adjacent distributions of the reaction coordinate along the pathway. We arrive
at an alternative formula (besides JE) to compute free energy differences from
the averaged values of the reaction coordinate. The combination of JE and the
alternative formula provides a viable way to determine the accuracy of computed
free energy differences. For the stretching of a deca-alanine molecule, our
approach requires 21 parallel simulations and relaxation time as small as 0.4
ns for each simulation to estimate free energy differences with an uncertainty
of about 13%.

is initially cut into two subsystems $A$ and $B$ which are glued together at
time $t=0$. We study the entanglement entropy (EE) between the two parts $A$
and $B$, using previous results by Calabrese and Cardy, and further extending
them. We also study in detail the (logarithmic) Loschmidt echo (LLE). For
finite-size systems both quantities turn out to be (almost) periodic in the
scaling limit, and exhibit striking light-cone effects. While these two
quantities behave similarly immediately after the quench---namely as $c/3 \log
t$ for the EE and $c/4 \log t$ for the LLE---, we observe some discrepancy once
the excitations emitted by the quench bounce on the boundary and evolve within
the same subsystem $A$ (or $B$). The decay of the EE is then non-universal, as
noticed by Eisler and Peschel. On the contrary, we find that the evolution of
the LLE is less sensitive than the EE to non-universal details of the model,
and is still accurately described by our CFT prediction. To further probe these
light-cone effects, we also introduce a variant of the Loschmidt echo
specifically constructed to detect the excitations emitted just after the

Electron motion is described by the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary
condition. The part of waveguide between the narrows plays the role of
resonator and there can occur electron resonant tunneling. This phenomenon
consists in the fact that, for an electron with energy $E$, the probability
$T(E)$ to pass from one part of the waveguide to the other part through the
resonator has a sharp peak at $E=E_{res}$, where $E_{res}$ denotes a ""resonant""
energy. In the present paper, we compare the asymptotics of
$E_{res}=E_{res}(\epsilon)$ and $T(E)=T(E, \epsilon)$ as $\epsilon \to 0$ with
the corresponding numerical results obtained by approximate computing the
waveguide scattering matrix. We show that there exists a band of $\epsilon$
where the asymptotics and numerical results are in close agreement. The
numerical calculations become inefficient as $\epsilon$ decreases; however, at
such a condition the asymptotics remains reliable. On the other hand, the
asymptotics gives way to the numerical method as $\epsilon$ increases; in fact,
for wide narrows the resonant tunneling vanishes by itself.
  Though, in the present paper, we consider only a 2D waveguide, the
applicability of the methods goes far beyond the above simplest model. In
particular, the same approach will work for asymptotic and numerical analysis
of resonant tunneling in 3D quantum waveguides.

great challenge for the developers of semantic technologies. This work aims to
explore ways to make explicit and available the tacit knowledge hidden in the
collective intelligence of a collaborative environment within organizations.
The environment was defined by folksonomies supported by a faceted semantic

density within the LSS is interpreted in a pseudo-cosmological sense. Using the
constraints formalism may help us to probe non-trivial spatial statistics of

with a linear system $V^*$ of generically smooth CY hypersurfaces, the formula
expresses period integrals in terms of a canonical global meromorphic top form
on $X$. Two important ingredients of our construction are the notion of a CY
principal bundle, and a classification of such rank one bundles. We also
generalize our construction to CY and general type complete intersections. When
$X$ is an algebraic manifold having a sufficiently large automorphism group $G$
and $V^*$ is a linear representation of $G$, we construct a holonomic D-module
that governs the period integrals. The construction is based in part on the
theory of tautological systems we have developed in the paper \cite{LSY1},
joint with R. Song. The approach allows us to explicitly describe a
Picard-Fuchs type system for complete intersection varieties of general types,
as well as CY, in any Fano variety, and in a homogeneous space in particular.

indicates that V and \Sigma may be sufficient to define the macroscopic states.
Moreover, we show that only one of the invariants of \Sigma is necessary, since
each component of \Sigma falls onto a master curve when plotted as a function
of Tr(\Sigma). This implies that these granular assemblies have a common shape
for the stress tensor, even though it does not correspond to the hydrostatic

analysis of this size-luminosity relation to investigate which of the general
properties of the dusty tori in active galactic nuclei can be derived from this

  We improve the accuracy of the size-luminosity relation by adding a few
additional size measurements from more recent interferometric observations and
compare the measured sizes to those derived from hydrodynamical and radiative
transfer models of AGN tori.
  We find that a Gaussian approximation yields a reasonable estimate of the
size of the brightness distribution, as long as the visibilities are within 0.2
{\leg} V {\leg} 0.9. The size estimates derived from the models are consistent
with those determined from the measurements. However, the models predict a
significant offset between the sizes derived for face-on and edge-on tori. This
offset is not observed in the current data, probably because of the large
uncertainties and low statistics of the present interferometric measurements.
Furthermore, we find a ratio of the mid- to near-infrared sizes of
approximately 30, whereas the first probes the body of the torus and the second
is an estimate of the inner rim.
  The size-luminosity relation of AGN tori using Gaussian size estimates is a
very simple and effective tool to investigate the internal structure and
geometry of AGN tori and obtain constraints on the differences between type 1

3.344, discovered in a deep, blind spectroscopic survey for faint Lyman alpha
emitters with the Magellan II telescope in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF).
The galaxy exhibits complex Lyman alpha emission, including an extended,
asymmetric component that is partially suppressed by damped Lyman alpha
absorption, and two spatially elongated, narrow emission features. Archival HST
ACS imaging shows evidence for tidal disruption of the stellar component. This
V=27 galaxy appears to give us unprecedented insights into two fundamental
stages in the formation of structure at high redshift: the inflow of gas into
ordinary galaxies, and the escape of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic
medium. Neutral hydrogen, falling in partly in form of a narrow filament,
appears to emit fluorescent Lyman alpha photons induced by the stellar ionizing
flux escaping from the disturbed galaxy. The in-falling material may represent
primary cold accretion or an interaction-triggered inflow. The rate of ionizing
photons required by the observed Lyman alpha emission is consistent with the
rate of photons produced by the observed stellar population, with roughly 50
percent of ionizing photons escaping from the immediate galaxy and encountering
the in-falling gas. The observational properties of the galaxy lend support to
a picture where galaxy interactions facilitate the escape of both Lyman alpha
and ionizing radiation. We argue that galaxies like the present object may be
common at high redshift. This galaxy may therefore be a late example of an
interacting population of dwarf galaxies contributing significantly to the
reionization of the universe.

star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy NGC6946, including its starbursting
nucleus, we compare a number of SFR diagnostics that are typically considered
to be unaffected by interstellar extinction: i.e., non-thermal radio (i.e.,
1.4GHz), total infrared (IR; 8-1000um), and warm dust (i.e., 24um) emission,
along with the hybrid (obscured + unobscured) indicators of H\alpha+24um and
UV+IR. The 33GHz free-free emission is assumed to provide the most accurate
measure of the current SFR. Among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the
24um, H\alpha+24um and UV+IR SFR calibrations are in good agreement with the
33GHz free-free SFRs. However, each of the SFR calibrations relying on some
form of dust emission overestimate the nuclear SFR by a factor of ~2. This is
more likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation of
non-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in the
nucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. SFR
calibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which only
agree with the free-free SFRs for the nucleus, and underestimate the SFRs from
the extranuclear star-forming regions by a factor of ~2. This result likely
arises from the CR electrons decaying within the starburst region with
negligible escape compared to the young extranuclear star-forming regions.
Finally, we find that the SFRs estimated using the total 33GHz emission agree
well with the free-free SFRs due to the large thermal fractions present at
these frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed. Thus,
rest-frame 33GHz observations may act as a reliable method to measure the SFRs
of galaxies at increasingly high redshift without the need of ancillary radio
data to account for the non-thermal emission.

simultaneously lowering the excess chemical potential of the ion. This effect

with a much larger range of black hole masses. The overall result still holds
even without correcting the BH mass estimates for the effects of radiation
pressure. We present a conjecture based on these results, which aims at
explaining the origin of radio-loudness in terms of two fundamental parameters:
the spin of the black hole and the black hole mass. We speculate that in order
to produce a RL AGN both of the following requirements must be satisfied: 1)the
black hole mass M_BH has to be larger than ~10^8 M_sun; 2)the spin of the BH
must be significant, in order to satisfy theoretical requirements. Taking into
account the most recent observations, we envisage a scenario in which the
merger history of the host galaxy plays a fundamental role in accounting for
both the properties of the AGN and the galaxy morphology, which in our picture
are strictly linked. RL sources might be obtained only through major dry
mergers involving BH of large mass, which would give rise to both the core
morphology and the significant black hole spin needed.

early epochs from the direct collapse of pre-galactic gas discs. Populating
dark matter halos with seeds formed in this fashion, we follow their mass
assembly history to the present time using a Monte-Carlo merger tree approach.
Using this formalism, we predict the black hole mass function at the present
time; the integrated mass density of black holes in the Universe; the
luminosity function of accreting black holes as a function of redshift and the
scatter in observed, local Mbh{\sigma}s relation. Signatures of these massive
seed models appear predominantly at the low mass end of the present day black
hole mass function. In fact, our prediction of the shape of the Mbh{\sigma}s
relation at the low mass end and increased scatter has recently been
corroborated by observations. These models predict that low surface brightness,
bulge-less galaxies with large discs are least likely to be sites for the
formation of massive seed black holes at high redshifts. The efficiency of seed
formation at high redshifts also has a direct influence on the black hole
occupation fraction in galaxies at z = 0. This effect is more pronounced for
low mass galaxies today as we predict the existence of a population of low mass
galaxies that do not host nuclear black holes. This is the key discriminant
between the models studied here and the Population-III remnant seed model.

the case where the angular velocity is determined by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process. The solution is fully characterized by only one dimensionless number,
the persistence angle, which is the typical angle of rotation of the object
during the correlation time of the angular velocity.
  We first show that the two-dimensional case is exactly solvable. When the
persistence angle is large, a series for the correlation function has the
surprising property that its sum varies much more slowly than any of its
individual terms.
  In three dimensions we obtain asymptotic forms for the correlation function,
in the limits where the persistence angle is very small and very large. The
latter case exhibits a complicated transient, followed by a much slower
exponential decay. The decay rate is determined by the solution of a radial
Schrodinger equation in which the angular momentum quantum number takes an
irrational value, namely j=(sqrt{17}-1)/2.

of the most optically luminous QSOs in the local Universe and a template
ULIRG-to-QSO transition object, located in a rich cool-core cluster at z=0.297.
The CO emission is likely to be extended, highly asymmetric with respect to the
center of the host elliptical where the QSO resides, and corresponds to a
molecular gas mass of ~ 8.0 x 10^{9} M_sun. The dynamical mass enclosed by the
CO line emission region could amount up to ~ 1.7x10^{12} M_sun (80% of the
total mass of the elliptical host). The bulk of the CO emission is located at
~9 kpc south-east from the nuclei position, and close to a faint optical
structure, suggesting that the CO emission could either represent a gas-rich
companion galaxy merging with the elliptical host or a tail-like structure
reminiscent of a previous interaction. We argue that the first scenario is more
likely given the large masses implied for the CO source, which would imply a
highly asymmetrical elliptical host. The close alignment between the CO
emission major axis and the radio-plume suggests a possible role of the latter
excitation of the ambient gas reservoir. The stacking technique was used to
search for CO emission and 3mm continuum emission from galaxies in the
surrounding cluster, however no detection was found either toward individual
galaxies or the stacked ensemble of galaxies, with a 3 sigma limit of <
1.1x10^9 M_sun for the molecular gas.

simultaneously transit from conducting to insulating states with the increase
of Coulomb correlation, accompanied by a paramagnetic (PM)-antiferromagnetic
(AFM) transition. The orbital selective Mott transition found in the PM
condition is completely suppressed over a wide correlation range, though it may
exist in the systems away from half-filling. In the insulating state, the
system crosses over from a partially-polarized spin-gapped phase in the
intermediate correlation regime to an almost fully-polarized Mott insulating

their luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties of
star forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating first
generation (Population III) stars. Since GRB afterglows have intrinsically very
simple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noise
spectroscopy, or photometry. Here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4
for the Swift-detected GRB 090429B based on deep observations with
Gemini-North, the Very Large Telescope, and the GRB Optical and Near-infrared
Detector. Assuming a Small Magellanic Cloud dust law (which has been found in a
majority of GRB sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06
< z < 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lower
redshifts. Adopting Milky Way or Large Magellanic Cloud dust laws leads to very
similar conclusions, while a Maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshift
solutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z>7. The
non-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (Y_AB >~ 28 mag, which would
correspond roughly to 0.001 L* at z=1) in our late time optical and infrared
observations with the Hubble Space Telescope strongly supports the extreme
redshift origin of GRB 090429B, since we would expect to have detected any
low-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. Finally, the energetics of GRB
090429B are comparable to those of other GRBs, and suggest that its progenitor
is not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

0.1 \micron$ or the power index of the grain size distribution is shallower
than $\sim -2.5$. The grain growth in clouds contributes to the rapid increase
of dust-to-gas ratio at a certain metallicity level (called critical
metallicity in Asano et al. 2011 and and Inoue 2011), which we find to be
sensitive to grain size distribution. Thus, the grain growth efficiently
increase the dust mass not only in nearby galaxies but also in high-redshift
quasars, whose metallicities are larger than the critical value. Our recipe for
the grain growth is applicable for any grain size distribution and easily
implemented into any framework of dust enrichment in galaxies.

counter-propagating field modes of a high-Q ring cavity. Our approach applies
to an arbitrary number of atoms N and includes the spatial variation of the
field throughout the ensemble. We report several new interesting aspects of
coherence and entangled behavior that emerge when the size of the atomic
ensemble is not taken to the thermodynamic limit of N>>1. Under such
conditions, it is found that the counter-propagating cavity modes, although in
the thermodynamic limit are mutually incoherent and exhibit no one-photon
interference, the modes can, however, be made mutually coherent and exhibit
interference after interacting with a finite-size atomic ensemble. It is also
found that the spatial redistribution of the atoms over a finite size results
in nonorthogonality of the collective bosonic modes. This nonorthogonality
leads to the super-bunching effect that the correlations of photons of the
individual cavity modes and of different modes are stronger than those of a
thermal field. However, we find that the correlations are not strong enough to
violate the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and to produce squeezing and entanglement
between the modes. Therefore, we investigate the spectral distributions of the
logarithmic negativity and the variances of the output fields. These functions
determine squeezing and entanglement properties of the output cavity fields and
can be measured by a homodyne technique. We find that the entanglement is
redistributed over several components of the spectrum and the finite-size
effect is to concentrate the entanglement at the zero-frequency component of
the spectrum.

metric is characterized by the study of appropriate model problems.
Particularly interesting is the problem of the stability of the solutions of
the Klein-Gordon equation, describing the propagation of a scalar field in the
background of a rotating (Kerr-) black hole. Results suggest that the stability
of the field depends crucially on its mass $\mu$. Among others, the paper
provides an improved bound for $\mu$ above which the solutions of the reduced,
by separation in the azimuth angle in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, Klein-Gordon
equation are stable. Finally, it gives new formulations of the reduced
equation, in particular, in form of a time-dependent wave equation that is
governed by a family of unitarily equivalent positive self-adjoint operators.
The latter formulation might turn out useful for further investigation. On the
other hand, it is proved that from the abstract properties of this family alone
it cannot be concluded that the corresponding solutions are stable.

this context, an original approach for generating machining process based on
machining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core of this approach is to
decompose a CAD model of complex forging die in geometric features.
Technological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric
feature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as
material, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging
process and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and
machining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between
the surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining features identification
cutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of forging die,
are associated to them in order to generate machining sequences. A machining
process model is proposed to formalize the links between information imbedded
in the machining features and the parameters of cutting tools and machining
strategies. At last machining sequences are grouped and ordered to generate the
complete die machining process. In this paper the identification of geometrical
features is detailed. Geometrical features identification is based on machining
knowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL
models. A map based on the contact area between cutting tools and die shape
gives basic geometrical features which are connected or not according to the
continuity maps. The proposed approach is illustrated by an application on an
industrial study case which was accomplished as part of collaboration.

of a distribution of relaxation times characterizing their time decay. Although
a very popular concept, a relaxation time distribution cannot be associated
with any time-decreasing quantity (from a mathematical point of view, the decay
has to be described by a completely monotonic function). Technically, we use a
memory kernel decaying as a Mittag-Leffler function (the Mittag-Leffler
functions interpolate between stretched or compressed exponential behaviour at
short times and inverse power law behaviour at large times). We show that, in
the case of a subdiffusive motion, relaxation time distributions can be defined

concepts, which play a significant role in the study of complexity science. The
coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law motivates different
understandings on the dependence between these two scalings, which is still
hardly been clarified.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this article, we observe an evolution
process of the scalings: the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law are naturally shaped
to coexist at the initial time, while the crossover comes with the emergence of
their inconsistency at the larger time before reaching a stable state, where
the Heaps' law still exists with the disappearance of strict Zipf's law. Such
findings are illustrated with a scenario of large-scale spatial epidemic
spreading, and the empirical results of pandemic disease support a universal
analysis of the relation between the two laws regardless of the biological
details of disease. Employing the United States(U.S.) domestic air
transportation and demographic data to construct a metapopulation model for
simulating the pandemic spread at the U.S. country level, we uncover that the
broad heterogeneity of the infrastructure plays a key role in the evolution of
scaling emergence.
  Conclusions/Significance: The analyses of large-scale spatial epidemic
spreading help understand the temporal evolution of scalings, indicating the
coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law depends on the collective
dynamics of epidemic processes, and the heterogeneity of epidemic spread
indicates the significance of performing targeted containment strategies at the
early time of a pandemic disease.

produce ~10 spatially offset events per year. A majority of tidal disruption
flares, and a large majority of flares with an observable spatial offset, are
due to bound rather than unbound stars. The total number of disruption events

space and dimension, a new framework of space theory is proposed in this paper.
Based on three sets of fractal dimensions, the geographical space is divided
into three types: real space (R-space), phase space (P-space), and order space
(O-space). The real space is concrete or visual space, the fractal dimension of
which can be evaluated through digital maps or remotely sensed images. The
phase space and order space are both abstract space, the fractal dimension
values of which cannot be estimated with one or two maps or images. The
dimension of phase space can be computed by using time series, and that of
order space can be determined with cross-sectional data in certain time. Three
examples are offered to illustrate the three types of spaces and fractal
dimension of geographical systems. The new space theory can be employed to
explain the parameters of geographical scaling laws, such as the scaling
exponent of the allometric growth law of cities and the fractal dimension based
on Horton's laws of rivers.

also describe high-energy soft and semihard interactions. In particular, the

that the production and hadronization of minijets with p_t\gapproxeq k_{sat}

Double-Pomeron-Exchange processes and in the p_t distributions of secondaries

manifestation of the interaction of two partonic cascades.

finite static electric fields is presented. Electronic band structures and
field-induced charge densities are compared with related literature data as
well as with own results on (AB) stacks. It is found, that the undoped
AB-bilayer has a tiny Fermi line consisting of one electron pocket around the
K-point and one hole pocket on the line K-$\Gamma$. In contrast to (AB) stacks,
the breaking of translational symmetry by the surface of finite (ABC) stacks
produces a gap in the bulk-like states for slabs up to a yet unknown critical
thickness $N^{\rm semimet} \gg 10$, while ideal (ABC) bulk ($\beta$-graphite)
is a semi-metal. Unlike in (AB) stacks, the ground state of (ABC) stacks is
shown to be topologically non-trivial in the absence of external electric
field. Consequently, surface states crossing the Fermi level must unavoidably
exist in the case of (ABC)-type stacking, which is not the case in (AB)-type
stacks. These surface states in conjunction with the mentioned gap in the
bulk-like states have two major implications. First, electronic transport
parallel to the slab is confined to a surface region up to the critical layer
number $N^{\rm semimet}$. Related implications are expected for stacking domain
walls and grain boundaries. Second, the electronic properties of (ABC) stacks
are highly tunable by an external electric field. In particular, the dielectric
response is found to be strongly nonlinear and can e.g. be used to discriminate
slabs with different layer numbers. Thus, (ABC) stacks rather than (AB) stacks
with more than two layers should be of potential interest for applications
relying on the tunability by an electric field.

universally bound the rate loss in the Wyner-Ziv problem, and has since then
been instrumental in e.g., bounding the rate loss in successive refinements,
universal quantization, and other multi-terminal source coding settings. The
ARDF is defined as the minimum mutual information over an additive test channel
followed by estimation. In the limit of high resolution, the ADRF coincides
with the true RDF for many sources and fidelity criterions. In the other
extreme, i.e., the limit of low resolutions, the behavior of the ARDF has not
previously been rigorously addressed. In this work, we consider the special
case of quadratic distortion and where the noise in the test channel is
Gaussian distributed. We first establish a link to the I-MMSE relation of Guo
et al. and use this to show that for any source the slope of the ARDF near zero
rate, converges to the slope of the Gaussian RDF near zero rate. We then
consider the multiplicative rate loss of the ARDF, and show that for bursty
sources it may be unbounded, contrary to the additive rate loss, which is upper
bounded by 1/2 bit for all sources. We finally show that unconditional
incremental refinement, i.e., where each refinement is encoded independently of
the other refinements, is ARDF optimal in the limit of low resolution,
independently of the source distribution. Our results also reveal under which
conditions linear estimation is ARDF optimal in the low rate regime.

bosons in QCD. Analyzing the x-dependent pion transverse radius we reveal a new
phenomenon of ""chiral inflation""-- in the parametrically wide region of Bjorken
x (m_pi^2/(4 pi F_pi)^2 << x << 1) the pion radius grows exponentially fast
with the rapidity eta=ln(1/x). We show that the partons in this interval of
Bjorken x contribute to famous logarithmic divergency of the pion radius. In

The phenomenon of the chiral inflation is at variance with the Gribov

broadcast channel (e.g., a wireless network), want to generate a common secret

on the bitstream. We assume that the nodes initially share a (small) piece of
information, but do not have access to any out-of-band channel. We ask the
question: can this problem be solved without relying on Eve's computational
limitations, i.e., without using any form of public-key cryptography?
  We propose a secret-agreement protocol, where the n nodes of the group keep
exchanging bits until they have all agreed on a bit sequence that Eve cannot
reconstruct with very high probability. In this task, the nodes are assisted by
a small number of interferers, whose role is to create channel noise in a way
that bounds the amount of information Eve can overhear. Our protocol has
polynomial-time complexity and requires no changes to the physical or MAC layer
of network devices.
  First, we formally show that, under standard theoretical assumptions, our
protocol is information-theoretically secure, achieves optimal
secret-generation rate for n = 2 nodes, and scales well to an arbitrary number
of nodes. Second, we adapt our protocol to a small wireless 14-square-meter
testbed; we experimentally show that, if Eve uses a standard wireless physical
layer and is not too close to any of the nodes, 8 nodes can achieve a
secret-generation rate of 38 Kbps. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the
first experimental demonstration of information-theoretic secret exchange on a

contradict this scenario, with the massive cluster Abell 1689 being often
claimed as a notable example of a highly over-concentrated halo. Shape and
orientation biases in lensing studies might be at the basis of this
disagreement between theory and observations. We developed a method for a full

maps estimated from lensing are de-projected to infer the actual triaxial
structure of the cluster, whose mass distribution is approximated as an
ellipsoidal Navarro-Frenk-White halo with arbitrary orientation. Inversion is
performed under competing a priori assumptions, integrated in the method thanks
to Bayesian statistics. We applied the method to A1689. Whatever the considered
priors on shape and orientation, both weak and strong lensing analyses found
the halo to be slightly over-concentrated but still consistent with theoretical
predictions. We found some evidence for a mildly triaxial lens (minor to major

the adversarial online learning setup. We develop a variant of approachability
for games where there is ambiguity in the obtained reward that belongs to a
set, rather than being a single vector. Using this variant we tackle the
problem of approachability in games with partial monitoring and develop simple
and efficient algorithms (i.e., with constant per-step complexity) for this
setup. We finally consider external regret and internal regret in repeated
games with partial monitoring and derive regret-minimizing strategies based on
approachability theory.

  Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising new solution to provide
convenient and perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks. In practice, WPT
is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic
resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for
short-/mid-/long-range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider
the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry
energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this
paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system
consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another
receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common
transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with
multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information
receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from
the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the
transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal
transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information
rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a
so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we
show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential
limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to
decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two
practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and
power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to
the outer bound.

cornerstones of modern statistical practice. This is especially the case in
Bayesian hierarchical models, where several decision theoretic frameworks can
be deployed. The estimation of these parameter ensembles may substantially vary
depending on which inferential goals are prioritised by the modeller. Since one
may wish to satisfy a range of desiderata, it is therefore of interest to
investigate whether some sets of point estimates can simultaneously meet
several inferential objectives. In this thesis, we will be especially concerned
with identifying ensembles of point estimates that produce good approximations
of (i) the true empirical quantiles and empirical quartile ratio (QR) and (ii)
provide an accurate classification of the ensemble's elements above and below a
given threshold. For this purpose, we review various decision-theoretic
frameworks, which have been proposed in the literature in relation to the
optimisation of different aspects of the empirical distribution of a parameter
ensemble. This includes the constrained Bayes (CB), weighted-rank squared error
loss (WRSEL), and triple-goal (GR) ensembles of point estimates. In addition,
we also consider the set of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and the
ensemble of posterior means --the latter being optimal under the summed squared
error loss (SSEL). Firstly, we test the performance of these different sets of
point estimates as plug-in estimators for the empirical quantiles and empirical
QR under a range of synthetic scenarios encompassing both spatial and
non-spatial simulated data sets. Performance evaluation is here conducted using
the posterior regret. Secondly, two threshold classification losses (TCLs)

performance of these decision-theoretic tools is also evaluated on real data

well agree with N-body simulation results on scales of BAOs. Especially
nonlinear effects on the baryon acoustic peak of the halo correlation function

nonlinearity and scale dependence of bias are fairly well reproduced by 1-loop
LRT up to k=0.35hMpc^{-1} (z=2 and 3) within a few percent level in real space

tackled using a growing amount of genomic data. While the genome of eukaryotes
is highly stable, bacterial genomes from cells of the same species highly vary
in gene content. This huge variation in gene content led to the concepts of the
distributed genome of bacteria and their pangenome (Tettelin et al.,2005;
Ehrlich et al.,2005). We present a population genetic model for gene content
evolution which accounts for several mechanisms. Gene uptake from the
environment is modeled by events of gene gain along the genealogical tree
relating the population. Pseudogenization may lead to deletion of genes and is
incoporated by gene loss. These two mechanisms were studied by Huson and Steel
(2004) using a fixed phylogenetic tree. Taking the random genealogy given by
the coalescent (Kingman, 1982; Hudson, 1983), we studied the resulting genomic
diversity already in Baumdicker et al. (2010). In the present paper, we extend
the model in order to incorporate events of interspecies horizontal gene
transfer. Within this model, we derive expectations for the gene frequency

important building blocks for energy harvesting applications such as solar
cells. [2, 5-8] However, due to their large surface-to-volume ratios, the
recombination of charge carriers through surface states reduces the carrier
diffusion lengths in nanowires a few orders of magnitude,[9] often resulting in
the low efficiency (a few percent or less) of nanowire-based solar cells. [7,
8, 10, 11] Reducing the recombination by surface passivation is crucial for the
realization of high performance nanosized optoelectronic devices, but remains
largely unexplored. [7, 12-14] Here we show that a thin layer of amorphous
silicon (a-Si) coated on a single-crystalline silicon nanowire (sc-SiNW),
forming a core-shell structure in-situ in the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process,
reduces the surface recombination nearly two orders of magnitude. Under
illumination of modulated light, we measure a greater than 90-fold improvement
in the photosensitivity of individual core-shell nanowires, compared to regular
nanowires without shell. Simulations of the optical absorption of the nanowires
indicate that the strong absorption of the a-Si shell contributes to this
effect, but we conclude that the effect is mainly due to the enhanced carrier
lifetime by surface passivation.

The intrinsic evolutionary braking is buried deep under superimposed irregular

F2-F1, F2-F0, F1-F0 and n_{obs}-tau_{ch} diagrams assuming their spin-down to
be the superposition of a ""true"" monotonous term and a symmetric oscillatory
term. We demonstrate that their effects may be clearly separated using simple
ad hoc arguments. Using maximum likelihood estimator we derive the parameters
of both components. We find characteristic timescales of such oscillations to
be of the order of 1e3-1e4 years, while its amplitudes are large enough to
modulate the observed spin-down rate up to 0.5-5 times and completely dominate
the second frequency derivatives. On the other hand, pulsars' secular evolution
is consistent with classical magnetodipolar model with braking index n ~ 3. So,
observed pulsars' characteristic ages (and similar estimators that depend on
the observed F1) are also affected by long term cyclic process and differ up to
0.5-5 times from their monotonous values. This fact naturally resolves the
discrepancy of characteristic and independently estimated physical ages of
several objects, as well as explains very large, up to 1e8 years,
characteristic ages of some pulsars. We discuss the possible physical
connection of long term oscillation with a complex neutron star rotation
relative its magnetic axis due to influence of the near-field part of

to analyze the evolution of the spectral parameters during the flare as a test
of the shock-in-jet model under these extreme conditions. Methods: For the
analysis of the flare we took into account that the flaring spectrum is
superimposed on a quiescent spectrum. We reconstructed the latter from archival
data and fitted a synchrotron self-absorbed distribution of emission. The
uncertainties of the derived spectral parameters were calculated using Monte
Carlo simulations. The spectral evolution is modeled by the shock-in-jet model,
and the derived results are discussed in the context of a geometrical model
(varying viewing angle) and shock-shock interaction. Results: The evolution of
the flare in the turnover frequency-turnover flux density plane shows a double
peak structure. The nature of this evolution is dicussed in the frame of
shock-in-jet models. We discard the generation of the double peak structure in
the turnover frequency-turnover flux density plane purely based on geometrical
changes (variation of the Doppler factor). The detailed modeling of the
spectral evolution favors a shock-shock interaction as a possible physical
mechanism behind the deviations from the standard shock-in-jet model.

W3 IRS 5 with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI) on Herschel
reveal the first hyperfine velocity-resolved OH far-infrared spectrum of a
star-forming region. The line profile of the OH emission shows two components:
a narrow component (FWHM approx. 4-5 km/s) with partially resolved hyperfine
structure resides on top of a broad (FWHM approx. 30 km/s) component. The
narrow emission agrees well with results from radiative transfer calculations
of a spherical envelope model for W3 IRS 5 with a constant OH abundance of
approx. 8e-9. Comparison with H2O yields OH/H2O abundance ratios of around 1e-3
for T > 100 K and around unity for T < 100K, consistent with the current
picture of the dense cloud chemistry with freeze-out and photodesorption. The
broad component is attributed to outflow emission. An abundance ratio of OH/H2O
> 0.028 in the outflow is derived from comparison with results of water line
modeling. This ratio can be explained by a fast J-type shock or a slower
UV-irradiated C-type shock.

We produced a prototype with 6 LED pulse drivers placed on a 4-layer PCB with

amplitude can be tuned from zero to 1.2 A. The pulse frequency can be set in
the range up to 100 kHz. The LED light is distributed by a 1 mm diameter

flashes light with homogeneity of \pm20%. The system is foreseen for
calibration of silicon photomultipliers embedded in scintillation tiles.

energetic origin, rather than a consequence of reduced fluctuations. We also
show complicated structures emerging in the interaction and density dependence

Achieving a better characterization and understanding of these processes not
only is of academic interest but also of high relevance for medical
applications as, e.g., the determination of absorption rates of electromagnetic
radiation by the human body. The dielectric properties of human blood are
studied using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, systematically investigating
the dependence on temperature and hematocrit value. By covering a frequency
range from 1 Hz to 40 GHz, information on all the typical dispersion regions of
biological matter is obtained. We find no evidence for a low-frequency
relaxation (alpha-relaxation) caused, e.g., by counterion diffusion effects as
reported for some types of biological matter. The analysis of a strong
Maxwell-Wagner relaxation arising from the polarization of the cell membranes
in the 1-100 MHz region (beta-relaxation) allows for the test of model
predictions and the determination of various intrinsic cell properties. In the
microwave region beyond 1 GHz, the reorientational motion of water molecules in
the blood plasma leads to another relaxation feature (gamma-relaxation).
Between beta- and gamma-relaxation, significant dispersion is observed, which,
however, can be explained by a superposition of these relaxation processes and
is not due to an additional delta-relaxation often found in biological matter.
Our measurements provide dielectric data on human blood of so far unsurpassed
precision for a broad parameter range. All data are provided in electronic form
to serve as basis for the calculation of the absorption rate of electromagnetic
radiation and other medical purposes. Moreover, by investigating an
exceptionally broad frequency range, valuable new information on the dynamic

maximize the net revenue earned by a cloud provider by renting servers to

provider offers its resources to two classes of customers: `premium' and
`basic'. Premium customers pay upfront fees to reserve servers for a specified
period of time (e.g. a year). Premium customers can submit jobs for their
reserved servers at any time and pay a fee for the server-hours they use. The
provider is liable to pay a penalty every time a `premium' job can not be
executed due to lack of resources. On the other hand, `basic' customers are
served on a best-effort basis, and pay a server-hour fee that may be higher
than the one paid by premium customers. The provider incurs energy costs when
running servers. Hence, it has an incentive to turn off idle servers. The
question of how to choose the number of servers to allocate to each pool (basic
and premium) is answered by analyzing a suitable queuing model and maximizing a
revenue function. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme adapts to
different traffic conditions, penalty levels, energy costs and usage fees.

differential light curves collected in the filters B and V which have been
analysed using the method of Wilson-Devinney (PHOEBE). After identification of
an adequate binary model and removal of the best-matching light curve solution,
we performed a Fourier analysis of the residual B and V light curves to
investigate the pulsational behaviour. We confirm the presence of rapid
pulsations with a main period of 27.2 min. Up to eight significant frequencies
with semi-amplitudes in the range 3 to 1 mmag were detected, all of which
surprisingly lie in the frequency range 43.5-53.5 c\d. This result is
independent from the choice of the primary's effective temperature (8200 or
8700 K) since the light curve models for the binary are very similar in both
cases. This is yet another case of a complex frequency spectrum observed for an
accreting Delta Scuti-type star (after Y Cam). In addition, we demonstrate that
the amplitudes of several of these pulsation frequencies show evidence of
variability on time scales as short as 1-2 years, perhaps even less. Moreover,
our analysis takes into account some recently acquired spectra, from which we
obtained the corresponding radial velocities for the years 2007-2009.
Investigation of the O-C diagram shows that further monitoring of the epochs of
eclipse minima of CT Her will cast a new light on the evolution of its orbital

shown that Saturn's moment of inertia can change up to ~2% due to different

course organized by the CERN Accelerator School (CAS), the topic being
'Magnets'. The course was held in Bruges, Belgium, from 16 to 25 June 2009.
This is the first time this topic has been selected for a specialized course.
Taking into account the number of related applications currently in use in
accelerators around the world, but, even more important, the worrying decrease
in the corresponding expertise in the different laboratories, it was recognized
that such a topic should definitively be incorporated into the CAS series of
specialized courses. The specific aim of the course was to introduce the
participants to the basics of resistive magnet design and its underlying
theoretical concepts. The first part of the school dealt with basic
introductory courses such as Maxwell's equations for magnets, beam optics,
physics and measurement of magnetic materials, the different types of resistive
magnets and their respective performance, an introduction to numerical field
computation, and a core lecture on basic magnet design. The second part of the
course focused more on quality control, the different measurement systems with
their electronics, calibration techniques and respective applications as well
as the question of stability and reproducibility. For the first time, in
addition to the actual lectures, a Case Study was proposed to the participants.
This consisted of eight hours of a guided practical exercise, where the
participants had to propose their own design for a magnet fulfilling the
boundary conditions corresponding to a combined-function magnet developed for
the ALBA Synchrotron Light Source in Barcelona, Spain. This Case Study was
enthusiastically received by the participants, who praised both the proposed
approach and the amount of practical information acquired from this exercise.
