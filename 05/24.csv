observed: earliest signal components, which appear well separated in delay, are
followed by an avalanche of components arriving with increasing rate of
occurrence, gradually merging into a diffuse tail with exponentially decaying
power. We model the channel as a propagation graph in which vertices represent
transmitters, receivers, and scatterers, while edges represent propagation
conditions between vertices. The recursive structure of the graph accounts for
the exponential power decay and the avalanche effect. We derive a closed form
expression for the graph's transfer matrix. This expression is valid for any
number of interactions and is straightforward to use in numerical simulations.
We discuss an example where time dispersion occurs only due to propagation in
between vertices. Numerical experiments reveal that the graph's recursive
structure yields both an exponential power decay and an avalanche effect.

  Sequences",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of standard stochastic approximation implementations can vary
significantly based on the choice of the steplength sequence, and in general,
little guidance is provided about good choices. Motivated by this gap, in the
first part of the paper, we present two adaptive steplength schemes for
strongly convex differentiable stochastic optimization problems, equipped with
convergence theory. The first scheme, referred to as a recursive steplength
stochastic approximation scheme, optimizes the error bounds to derive a rule
that expresses the steplength at a given iteration as a simple function of the
steplength at the previous iteration and certain problem parameters. This rule
is seen to lead to the optimal steplength sequence over a prescribed set of
choices. The second scheme, termed as a cascading steplength stochastic
approximation scheme, maintains the steplength sequence as a piecewise-constant
decreasing function with the reduction in the steplength occurring when a
suitable error threshold is met. In the second part of the paper, we allow for
nondifferentiable objective and we propose a local smoothing technique that
leads to a differentiable approximation of the function. Assuming a uniform
distribution on the local randomness, we establish a Lipschitzian property for
the gradient of the approximation and prove that the obtained Lipschitz bound
grows at a modest rate with problem size. This facilitates the development of
an adaptive steplength stochastic approximation framework, which now requires
sampling in the product space of the original measure and the artificially
introduced distribution. The resulting adaptive steplength schemes are applied
to three stochastic optimization problems. We observe that both schemes perform
well in practice and display markedly less reliance on user-defined parameters.

here was via the logistic map (r = 4) to which we added correlated noise

requirements on the distortion level at Bob, and the equivocation rate at the

of the conventional problems of secure source coding with side information at
the decoders, and the wiretap channel. Inner and outer bounds on the
rate-distortion-equivocation region for the case of arbitrary channels and side

showed that these four objects (with metallicity estimates of 8.5 =< 12 +

coverage to include the [OII] 3726,3729 doublet, which adds leverage in oxygen
abundance estimates and allows measurements of N/O ratios. All four spectra are
low excitation, with relatively high N/O ratios (N/O >~ 0.10), each of which
tend to bias estimates based on strong emission lines toward high oxygen
abundances. These spectra all fall in a regime where the ""standard"" strong line
methods for metallicity determinations are not well calibrated either
empirically or by photoionization modeling. By comparing our spectra directly
to photoionization models, we estimate oxygen abundances in the range of 7.9 =<
12 + log(O/H) =< 8.4, consistent with the scatter of the mass-metallicity
relation. We discuss the physical nature of these galaxies that leads to their
unusual spectra (and previous classification as outliers), finding their low
excitation, elevated N/O, and strong Balmer absorption are consistent with the
properties expected from galaxies evolving past the ""Wolf-Rayet galaxy"" phase.
We compare our results to the ""main"" sample of Peeples et al. (2008) and
conclude that they are outliers primarily due to enrichment of nitrogen
relative to oxygen, and not due to unusually high oxygen abundances for their

masses. All the cores are driving CO(3-2) outflows up to 38 km/s, majority of

reservoir of dense molecular gas in the immediate medium and ongoing accretion

eventually form a massive star cluster. This study provides a first glimpse of
massive, clustered star formation that currently undergoes through an

electron affinities far exceed those of halogen atoms and are important to
chemical industry as oxidizing agents, bio-catalysts, and building blocks of
salts. Using Wade-Mingos rule well known for describing the stability of
closo-boranes (BnHn2-) and state of the art theoretical method we show that a
new class of super and hyperhalogens, guided by this rule, can be formed by
tailoring the size and composition of borane derivatives. Unlike conventional
superhalogens which have a metal atom at the core surrounded by halogen atoms,
the superhalogens formed using the Wade-Mingos rule do not have to have either
halogen or metal atoms. We demonstrate this by using B12H13 and its
isoelectronic cluster, CB11H12 as examples. We also show that while
conventional superhalogens containing alkali atoms require at least two halogen
atoms, only one borane-like moiety is sufficient to render M(B12H12) (M=Li, Na,
K, Rb, Cs) clusters superhalogen properties. In addition, hyperhalogens can be
formed by using the above superhalogens as building blocks. Examples include
M(B12H13)2 and M(C-B11H12)2 (M=Li - Cs). This finding opens the door to an
untapped source of superhalogens and weakly coordinating anions with potential
applications.

of the time series of a macroscopic observable --- the total magnetization of

time series generated by chaotic spin lattices exhibit exponential
high-frequency tails, while, for the integrable spin lattices, the power

velocity. Asymmetries in the radial velocity field were detected for the
companion, very likely due the interaction between the galaxies. The
interaction between the main and companion galaxies was modelled using
numerical N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, with the result indicating that
the current stage of the system would be about 90 Myr after perigalacticum. The
spatial variation in the distribution of the stellar-population components in
both galaxies was analysed using the stellar population synthesis code {\sc
STARLIGHT}. The companion galaxy is dominated by a very young (t $ \leq
1\times10^{8}$ yr) population, with the fraction of this population to the
total flux at $\lambda\, 5\,870\, \AA$, increasing outwards in the galaxy disc.

the slit positions observed. Spatial profiles of oxygen abundance in the
gaseous phase were obtained using the diagnostic diagram R23 vs. [OIII]/[OII],
where we compared the observed values with the ones obtained from
photoionization models.
  Such gradients of oxygen abundance are significantly flatter for this pair of
galaxies than in typical isolated spiral galaxies. This metallicity
distribution is interpreted as the gradients having been destroyed by
interaction-induced gas flows from the outer parts to the centre of the galaxy

$f:2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ over a ground set $N$ subject to a variety of
packing type constraints including (multiple) matroid constraints, knapsack
constraints, and their intersections. In this paper we develop a general
framework that allows us to derive a number of new results, in particular when
$f$ may be a non-monotone function. Our algorithms are based on (approximately)
maximizing the multilinear extension $F$ of $f$ over a polytope $P$ that
represents the constraints, and then effectively rounding the fractional
solution. Although this approach has been used quite successfully, it has been
limited in some important ways. We overcome these limitations as follows.
  First, we give constant factor approximation algorithms to maximize $F$ over
a down-closed polytope $P$ described by an efficient separation oracle.
Previously this was known only for monotone functions. For non-monotone
functions, a constant factor was known only when the polytope was either the
intersection of a fixed number of knapsack constraints or a matroid polytope.
Second, we show that contention resolution schemes are an effective way to
round a fractional solution, even when $f$ is non-monotone. In particular,
contention resolution schemes for different polytopes can be combined to handle
the intersection of different constraints. Via LP duality we show that a
contention resolution scheme for a constraint is related to the correlation gap
of weighted rank functions of the constraint. This leads to an optimal
contention resolution scheme for the matroid polytope.
  Our results provide a broadly applicable framework for maximizing linear and
submodular functions subject to independence constraints. We give several
illustrative examples. Contention resolution schemes may find other
applications.

  In 2006, Bond & Siegel examined archival HST optical images of the M31 RV
site, obtained in 1999. We found only old red giants at the site, and no stars
of unusual color. However, Shara et al. recently claimed to have detected (a) a
bright UV source within the error box in HST UV images taken in 1995, (b) a hot

(c) cooling of this source from 1999 to 2008. Shara et al. argue that this

  I have re-examined all of the HST frames, including new ones obtained in

was actually due to cosmic rays striking the same pixel in two successive

hot is actually due to misinterpretation of red-giant colors in the STmagnitude
system; (c) there is no evidence for variability of any source within the error
box from 1999 to 2010; and (d) there are no stars of unusually blue or red
color in the error box. Our 2006 conclusions remain valid: either M31 RV had
faded below HST detectability by 1999, or its remnant is an unresolved
companion of a red giant in the field, or the remnant is one of the red giants.

The data show two separate clouds along the sightline at an impact parameter of
95kpc from the galaxy. The first is likely low-metallicity gas falling onto the
galaxy. This assessment is based on the high velocity offset of the cloud from
the galaxy (delta_v = 365kms) and the weak metal line absorption, combined with
photoionization modeling. The second cloud, with only a modest velocity
separation from the galaxy (delta_v = 85kms), exhibits very strong OVI
absorption qualitatively similar to OVI absorption seen in the Milky Way halo.
Collisional ionization equilibrium models are ruled out by the metal line
column density ratios. Photoionization modeling implies a length-scale for the
OVI cloud of ~0.1-1.2Mpc, which indicates the absorbing gas most likely resides
within the local filamentary structure. This system emphasizes that kinematic
association alone is not sufficient to establish a physical connection to
galaxies, even at small impact parameters and velocity separations.
Observations such as these, connecting galaxies with their gaseous

galaxies down to very low intensities. Using atomic hydrogen (HI) data, mostly
from THINGS, we predict the local mean CO velocity from the mean HI velocity.
By renormalizing the CO velocity axis so that zero corresponds to the local
mean HI velocity we are able to stack spectra coherently over large regions as
function of radius. This enables us to measure CO intensities with high
significance as low as Ico = 0.3 K km/s (H2_SD = 1 Msun/pc2), an improvement of
about one order of magnitude over previous studies. We detect CO out to radii
Rgal = R25 and find the CO radial profile to follow a uniform exponential
decline with scale length of 0.2 R25. Comparing our sensitive CO profiles to
matched profiles of HI, Halpha, FUV, and IR emission at 24um and 70um, we
observe a tight, roughly linear relation between CO and IR intensity that does
not show any notable break between regions that are dominated by molecular (H2)
gas (H2_SD > HI_SD) and those dominated by atomic gas (H2_SD < HI_SD). We use
combinations of FUV+24um and Halpha+24um to estimate the recent star formation
rate (SFR) surface density, SFR_SD, and find approximately linear relations
between SFR_SD and H2_SD. We interpret this as evidence for stars forming in
molecular gas with little dependence on the local total gas surface density.
While galaxies display small internal variations in the SFR-to-H2 ratio, we do
observe systematic galaxy-to-galaxy variations. These galaxy-to-galaxy
variations dominate the scatter in relations between CO and SFR tracers
measured at large scales. The variations have the sense that less massive
galaxies exhibit larger ratios of SFR-to-CO than massive galaxies. Unlike the
SFR-to-CO ratio, the balance between HI and H2 depends strongly on the total
gas surface density and radius. It must also depend on additional parameters.

presence of extra families enhances the Standard Model Higgs-nucleon coupling,
which has crucial impact on the Higgs and dark matter searches. We study the
limits on the inert dark matter mass in view of recent Xenon100 data. We find
that the mass of the inert dark matter must lie in a very narrow window 74-76

we discuss the cases with fewer extra families, where the possibility of a
light Higgs boson opens up, enlarging the dark matter mass window to m_h/2-76

implies a lower bound on the monochromatic gamma-ray flux from DM annihilation
in the galactic halo. For the mirror case, the predicted annihilation cross
section lies a factor of 4-5 below the current limit set by Fermi LAT, thus
providing a promising indirect detection signal.

abundances are simultaneously generated via the Affleck-Dine mechanism. In its
simplest realization, Affleck-Dine cogenesis is accomplished by a single
superpotential operator and its A-term counterpart. These operators explicitly
break B-L and X, the dark matter number, to the diagonal B-L+X. In the early
universe these operators stabilize supersymmetric flat directions carrying
non-zero B-L and X, and impart the requisite CP violation for asymmetry
generation. Because B-L+X is preserved, the resulting B-L and X asymmetries are
equal and opposite, though this precise relation may be relaxed if B-L and X
are violated separately by additional operators. Our dark matter candidate is
stabilized by R-parity and acquires an asymmetric abundance due to its non-zero
X number. For a dark matter mass of order a few GeV, one naturally obtains the
observed ratio of energy densities today, Omega_{DM}/Omega_B \sim 5. These
theories typically predict macroscopic lifetimes for the lightest observable
supersymmetric particle as it decays to the dark matter.

(EGB) in the 0.1-100 GeV range as measured by the Large Area Telescope (LAT)
onboard the Fermi satellite. The EGB can be fully explained as the sum of three
distinct components, namely blazars, non-beamed AGNs (Seyfert galaxies and
QSOs), and cosmic rays from star-forming galaxies. The contribution to the
background from beamed sources is obtained by fitting the Fermi-LAT blazar
differential number counts assuming that the gamma-ray luminosity function is
directly proportional to the radio luminosity function of FRI and FRII
galaxies. The high energy emission from non-beamed AGNs is instead determined
by popular synthesis models of the observed X-ray background. Finally, the EGB
is fit by adding a third component arising from pion decay in cosmic rays,
assuming that such component is closely linked to the cosmic star formation
history. We find that blazars dominate at energies \geq 10 GeV, for E \leq 0.2
GeV the main contribution is from non-beamed AGNs, while cosmic rays are
required in between. Because of absorption due to interaction of gamma-rays
with the extra-galactic background light, our model falls short at the highest
energies probed by LAT, (\geq 70 GeV), leaving room to a possible contribution
from dark matter particle annihilation. As an example, a particle of mass ~ 0.5

candidate galaxy: the isolated giant spiral NGC 1961. We observed four
quadrants around the galaxy for 30 ks each, carefully subtracting background
and point source emission, and found diffuse emission that appears to extend to
40-50 kpc. We fit $\beta$-models to the emission, and estimate a hot halo mass

the solar interior, particularly in the examination of fine-scale structure.
Traditional analysis of traveltimes relies on a geometrical ray picture of
acoustic wave propagation, which assumes high frequencies. However, it is
well-known that traveltimes obtained from finite-frequency waves are sensitive
to variations of medium parameters in a wide Fresnel zone around the ray path.
To address this problem, Fr\'{e}chet traveltime sensitivity kernels have
previously been developed. These kernels use a more realistic approximation of
the wave propagation to obtain a linear relationship between traveltimes and
variations in medium parameters. Fr\'{e}chet kernels take into account the
actual frequency content of the measured waves and, thus, reproduce the Fresnel
zone. Kernel theory has been well-developed in previous work on plane-parallel
models of the Sun for use in local helioseismology. Our primary purpose is to
apply kernel theory to much larger scales and in a spherical geometry. We also
present kernel theory in a different way, using basic functional analytic
methods, in the hope that this approach provides an even clearer understanding
of the theory, as well as a set of tools for calculating kernels. Our results
are very general and can be used to develop kernels for sensitivity to sound

sets in at an energy scale of order of the chemical potential, and orders at

band dispersions that are compatible with the photoemission results. In this
regime, the stripe antiferromagnetic order is further stabilized and the

dust condensed in type II supernova explosions. We parametrize the
microphysical properties in terms of the shape factor of the grain and the
sticking coefficient of gas-phase carbon atoms onto the grain surfaces. We find
that the amount of dust formed is fairly independent of these properties,
within the parameter range considered, though limited by the available amount
of carbon atoms not locked in CO molecules. However, we find that the
condensation times and size distributions of dust grains depend sensitively on
the microphysical parameters, with the mass distributions being weighted toward
larger effective radii for conditions considering grains with higher sticking
coefficients and/or more aspherical shapes. We discuss that this leads to
important consequences on the predicted extinction law of SN dust and on the
survival rate of the formed grains as they pass through the reverse shock of
the SN. We conclude that a more detailed understanding of the dust formation
process and of the microphysical properties of each dust species needs to be
achieved before robust prediction on the SN dust yields can be performed.

stratified hot halo gas, we examine the conditions under which clouds can form
and condense out of the hot halo medium to potentially fuel star formation in
the gaseous disk. We find that halo clouds do not develop from linear isobaric
perturbations. This is a regime where the cooling time is longer than the
Brunt-Vaisala time, confirming previous linear analysis. We extend the analysis
into the nonlinear regime by considering mildly or strongly nonlinear
perturbations with overdensities up to 100, also varying the initial height,
the cloud size, and the metallicity of the gas. Here, the result depends on the
ratio of cooling time to the time required to accelerate the cloud to the sound
speed (similar to the dynamical time). If the ratio exceeds a critical value
near unity, the cloud is accelerated without further cooling and gets disrupted
by Kelvin-Helmholtz and/or Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. If it is less than
the critical value, the cloud cools and condenses before disruption. Accreting
gas with overdensities of 10-20 is expected to be marginally unstable; the
cooling fraction will depend on the metallicity, the size of the incoming
cloud, and the distance to the galaxy. Locally enhanced overdensities within
cold streams have a higher likelihood of cooling out. Our results have
implications on the evolution of clouds seeded by cold accretion that are
barely resolved in current cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and absorption
line systems detected in galaxy halos.

smallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by the
spacecraft. A second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in the
photometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as being
caused by a planet at the time of that announcement. Here we apply the
light-curve modeling technique known as BLENDER to explore the possibility that
the signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). To aid in
this analysis we report the observation of two transits with the Spitzer Space
Telescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. When combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85
ppm that is consistent with the depth in the Kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,
ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of a
significantly different color than the target. Using these observations along
with other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we are
able to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. We assess the
likelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarm
rate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as a
planet (designated Kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. The
radius of this object is measured to be Rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 Earth radii.
Kepler-10 c represents another example (with Kepler-9 d and Kepler-11 g) of
statistical ""validation"" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual
""confirmation"" that can take place when the Doppler signal is detected or
transit timing variations are measured. It is anticipated that many of Kepler's
smaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamical
confirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of current
instrumentation.

treat the double barrier as a quantum coherent scattering region that can

ac-bias voltage. As a consequence of the manyfold parameters that are involved
in this system, a complicated step-like structure arises in the non-symmetrized
current-current auto correlation spectrum and a peak-like structure in the
cross correlation spectrum with and without harmonic ac-driving. We present an
analytic solution for these noise spectral functions by assuming a Breit-Wigner
lineshape. In detail we study how the correlation functions are affected by
photo-assisted tunneling (PAT) events and discuss the underlying elementary
events of charge transfer where we identify a new kind of contribution to
shot-noise. This enables us to clarify the influence of a not centered
irradiation of such a structure with light in terms of contributions
originating from different sets of coherent scattering channels. Moreover we
show how the noise is influenced by acquiring a scattering phase due to the

to be infinity and then the barrier strength is suddenly changed to a finite

The exact results based on exact diagonaliztion verify the enhancement of

can well describe the dynamics in the weakly interacting regime, but is not
efficient to give quantitatively consistent results in the strongly interacting

understand what happens when information is stored in the state of a quantum

entanglement, which can be exploited to achieve novel tasks such as
teleportation and superdense coding. Current technologies allow the
transmission of entangled photon pairs across distances up to roughly 100
kilometers. For longer distances, noise arising from various sources degrade
the transmission of entanglement to the point that it becomes impossible to use
the entanglement as a resource for future tasks. A strategy for dealing with
this difficulty is to employ quantum repeaters, stations intermediate between
the sender and receiver which participate in the process of entanglement
distillation, thereby improving on what the sender and receiver could do on
their own. In this work, we study entanglement distillation between two
recipients sharing a mixed state and with the help of repeater stations. We
extend the notion of entanglement of assistance to arbitrary states and give a
protocol for extracting pure entanglement. We also study quantum communication
protocols in a more general context. We give a new protocol for the task of
multiparty state merging. The previous multiparty state merging protocol
required the use of time-sharing. Our protocol does not require time-sharing
for distributed compression of two senders. In the one-shot regime, we achieve
multiparty state merging with entanglement costs not restricted to corner

Then we get a new energy density of metric fluctuations of Minkowski spacetime

characteristic of free-field blast waves. Descriptions are included for shock
tube diameters of 27 - 79 mm. A range of peak pressures from 204 kPa to 1187

the driver section diameter and distance from the shock tube opening. The peak
pressures varied predictably with distance from the shock tube opening while
maintaining both a true blast wave profile and relevant pulse duration for
distances up to about one diameter from the shock tube opening. This shock tube
design provides a more realistic blast profile than current compression-driven
shock tubes, and it does not have a large jet effect. In addition, operation
does not require specialized personnel or facilities like most blast-driven
shock tubes, which reduces operating costs and effort and permits greater
throughput and accessibility. It is expected to be useful in assessing the
response of various sensors to shock wave loading; assessing the reflection,
transmission, and absorption properties of candidate armor materials; assessing
material properties at high rates of loading; assessing the response of
biological materials to shock wave exposure; and providing a means to validate
numerical models of the interaction of shock waves with structures. All of
these activities have been difficult to pursue in a laboratory setting due in

  Our methodology relies on a spatial decomposition of the Markov operator
underlying the KMC algorithm into a hierarchy of operators corresponding to the
processors' structure in the parallel architecture. Based on this operator
decomposition, we formulate Fractional Step Approximation schemes by employing
the Trotter Theorem and its random variants; these schemes, (a) determine the
communication schedule} between processors, and (b) are run independently on
each processor through a serial KMC simulation, called a kernel, on each
fractional step time-window.
  Furthermore, the proposed mathematical framework allows us to rigorously
justify the numerical and statistical consistency of the proposed algorithms,
showing the convergence of our approximating schemes to the original serial
KMC. The approach also provides a systematic evaluation of different processor
communicating schedules.

of interactions are simultaneously present. We assume that a set of dynamical
systems are coupled through the connections of two or more distinct networks
(each of which corresponds to a distinct type of interaction), and we refer to
such a system as a hypernetwork. Applications include neural networks formed of
both electrical gap junctions and chemical synapses, the coordinated motion of
shoals of fishes communicating through both vision and flow sensing, and
hypernetworks of coupled chaotic oscillators. We first analyze the case of a
hypernetwork formed of $m=2$ networks. We look for necessary and sufficient
conditions for synchronization. We attempt at reducing the linear stability
problem in a master stability function form, i.e., at decoupling the effects of
the coupling functions from the structure of the networks. Unfortunately, we
are unable to obtain a reduction in a master stability function form for the
general case. However, we show that such a reduction is possible in three cases
of interest: (i) the Laplacian matrices associated with the two networks
commute; (ii) one of the two networks is unweighted and fully connected; (iii)
one of the two networks is such that the coupling strength from node $i$ to
node $j$ is a function of $j$ but not of $i$. Furthermore, we define a class of
networks such that if either one of the two coupling networks belongs to this
class, the reduction can be obtained independently of the other network. As an
example of interest, we study synchronization of a neural hypernetwork for
which the connections can be either chemical synapses or electrical gap
junctions. We propose a generalization of our stability results to the case of
hypernetworks formed of $m\geq 2$ networks.

superconductivity of all iron-based materials, it is important to determine
their common magnetic features. Here we use neutron scattering to map out spin

Markov models used in phylogenetics. For continuous-time Markov chains, a
sufficient condition for multiplicative closure of a model class is ensured by
demanding that the set of rate-matrices belonging to the model class form a Lie
algebra. It is the case that some well-known Markov models do form Lie algebras
and we refer to such models as ""Lie Markov models"". However it is also the case
that some other well-known Markov models unequivocally do not form Lie
algebras. In this paper, we will discuss how to generate Lie Markov models by
demanding that the models have certain symmetries under nucleotide
permutations. We show that the Lie Markov models include, and hence provide a
unifying concept for, ""group-based"" and ""equivariant"" models. For each of two,
three and four character states, the full list of Lie Markov models with
maximal symmetry is presented and shown to include interesting examples that
are neither group-based nor equivariant. We also argue that our scheme is
pleasing in the context of applied phylogenetics, as, for a given symmetry of
nucleotide substitution, it provides a natural hierarchy of models with
increasing number of parameters.

structures on surfaces for which a local orthonormal frame is given by a Lie
bracket generating pair of vector fields that can become collinear.
Generically, the singular set is an embedded one dimensional manifold and there
are three type of points: Riemannian points where the two vector fields are
linearly independent, Grushin points where the two vector fields are collinear
but their Lie bracket is not and tangency points where the two vector fields
and their Lie bracket are collinear and the missing direction is obtained with
one more bracket. Generically tangency points are isolated. In this paper we
study the Laplace-Beltrami operator on such a structure. In the case of a
compact orientable surface without tangency points, we prove that the
Laplace-Beltrami operator is essentially self-adjoint and has discrete
spectrum. As a consequence a quantum particle in such a structure cannot cross
the singular set and the heat cannot flow through the singularity. This is an
interesting phenomenon since when approaching the singular set (i.e. where the
vector fields become collinear), all Riemannian quantities explode, but
geodesics are still well defined and can cross the singular set without
singularities. This phenomenon appears also in sub-Riemannian structure which
are not equiregular i.e. in which the grow vector depends on the point. We show
this fact by analyzing the Martinet case.

systems by nucleating protein complexes in which, for example, enzymes and
substrates are co-localized. Proteins that specialize in this function are
called by a variety names, including adapter, linker and scaffold.
Scaffold-mediated nucleation of protein complexes can be either constitutive or
induced. Induced nucleation is commonly mediated by a docking site on a
scaffold that is activated by phosphorylation. Here, by considering minimalist
mathematical models, which recapitulate scaffold effects seen in more
mechanistically detailed models, we obtain analytical and numerical results
that provide insights into scaffold function. These results elucidate how
recruitment of a pair of ligands to a scaffold depends on the concentrations of
the ligands, on the binding constants for ligand-scaffold interactions, on
binding cooperativity, and on the milieu of the scaffold, as ligand recruitment
is affected by competitive ligands and decoy receptors. For the case of a
bivalent scaffold, we obtain an expression for the unique scaffold
concentration that maximally recruits a pair of monovalent ligands. Through
simulations, we demonstrate that a bivalent scaffold can nucleate distinct sets
of ligands to equivalent extents when the scaffold is present at different
concentrations. Thus, the function of a scaffold can potentially change
qualitatively with a change in copy number. We also demonstrate how a scaffold
can change the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme and the sensitivity of the
rate of reaction to substrate concentration. The results presented here should
be useful for understanding scaffold function and for engineering scaffolds to
have desired properties.

functions of quantum impurity models, the results are affected by
discretization and truncation errors. The discretization errors can be
alleviated by averaging over different discretization meshes (z-averaging), but
since each partial calculation is still performed for a finite discrete system,
there are always some residual discretization and finite-size errors. The
truncation errors affect the energies of the states and result in the
displacement of the delta peak spectral contributions from their correct
positions. The two types of errors are interrelated: for coarser
discretization, the discretization errors increase, but the truncation errors
decrease since the separation of energy scales in enhanced. In this work, it is
shown that by calculating a series of spectral functions for a range of the
total number of states kept in the NRG truncation, it is possible to estimate
the errors and determine the error-bars for spectral functions, which is
important when making accurate comparison to the results obtained by other
methods and for determining the errors in the extracted quantities (such as
peak positions, heights, and widths). The related spectral broadening issues
are also discussed: it is shown that the overbroadening contorts the results
without, surprisingly, reducing the variance of the curves. The method is
applied to determine the error bounds in the Kondo peak splitting in the

treat the available radial velocity data for GJ876 in the traditional white
noise model, because the actual noise appears autocorrelated (and demonstrates
non-white frequency spectrum). The time scale of this correlation is about a
few days, and the contribution of the correlated noise is about 2 m/s (i.e.,
similar to the level of internal errors in the Keck data). We propose a
variation of the maximum-likelihood algorithm to estimate the orbital
configuration of the system, taking into account the red noise effects. We
show, in particular, that the non-zero orbital eccentricity of the innermost
planet \emph{d}, obtained in previous studies, is likely a result of
misinterpreted red noise in the data. In addition to offsets in some orbital
parameters, the red noise also makes the fit uncertainties systematically
underestimated (while they are treated in the traditional white noise model).
Also, we show that the orbital eccentricity of the outermost planet is actually
ill-determined, although bounded by $\sim 0.2$. Finally, we investigate
possible orbital non-coplanarity of the system, and limit the mutual
inclination between the planets \emph{b} and \emph{c} orbits by
$5^\circ-15^\circ$, depending on the angular position of the mutual orbital

appears due to the pairing of electrons. This offers a fascinating arena to
study the physics of broken gauge symmetry. However, the important symmetries
in superconductors are not only the gauge invariance. Especially, the symmetry
properties of the pairing, i.e., the parity and spin-singlet/spin-triplet,
determine the physical properties of the superconducting state. Recently it has
been recognized that there is the important third symmetry of the pair
amplitude, i.e., even or odd parity with respect to the frequency. The
conventional uniform superconducting states correspond to the even-frequency
pairing, but the recent finding is that the odd-frequency pair amplitude arises
in the spatially non-uniform situation quite ubiquitously. Especially, this is
the case in the Andreev bound state (ABS) appearing at the surface/interface of
the sample. The other important recent development is on the nontrivial
topological aspects of superconductors. As the band insulators are classified
by topological indices into (i) conventional insulator, (ii) quantum Hall
insulator, and (iii) topological insulator, also are the gapped
superconductors. The influence of the nontrivial topology of the bulk states
appears as the edge or surface of the sample. In the superconductors, this
leads to the formation of zero energy ABS (ZEABS). Therefore, the ABSs of the
superconductors are the place where the symmetry and topology meet each other
which offer the stage of rich physics. In this review, we discuss the physics
of ABS from the viewpoint of the odd-frequency pairing, the topological
bulk-edge correspondence, and the interplay of these two issues. It is
described how the symmetry of the pairing and topological indices determines
the absence/presence of the ZEABS, its energy dispersion, and properties as the
Majorana fermions.

vacuum of space is not empty. In fact, quantum theory predicts that it teems
with virtual particles flitting in and out of existence. While initially a
curiosity, it was quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had
measurable consequences, for instance producing the Lamb shift of atomic
spectra and modifying the magnetic moment for the electron. This type of
renormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now central to our understanding
of nature. However, these effects provide indirect evidence for the existence
of vacuum fluctuations. From early on, it was discussed if it might instead be
possible to more directly observe the virtual particles that compose the
quantum vacuum. 40 years ago, Moore suggested that a mirror undergoing
relativistic motion could convert virtual photons into directly observable real
photons. This effect was later named the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE). Using
a superconducting circuit, we have observed the DCE for the first time. The
circuit consists of a coplanar transmission line with an electrical length that
can be changed at a few percent of the speed of light. The length is changed by
modulating the inductance of a superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) at high frequencies (~11 GHz). In addition to observing the creation of
real photons, we observe two-mode squeezing of the emitted radiation, which is
a signature of the quantum character of the generation process.

from large Ly-alpha forest surveys represent the next frontier of dark energy
studies. As part of this effort, efficient simulations of the BAO signature
from the Ly-alpha forest will be required. We construct a model for producing
fast, large volume simulations of the Ly-alpha forest for this purpose.
Utilising a calibrated semi-analytic approach, we are able to run very large
simulations in 1 Gpc^3 volumes which fully resolve the Jeans scale in less than
a day on a desktop PC using a GPU enabled version of our code. The Ly-alpha
forest spectra extracted from our semi-analytical simulations are in excellent
agreement with those obtained from a fully hydrodynamical reference simulation.
Furthermore, we find our simulated data are in broad agreement with
observational measurements of the flux probability distribution and 1D flux
power spectrum. We are able to correctly recover the input BAO scale from the
3D Ly-alpha flux power spectrum measured from our simulated data, and estimate
that a BOSS-like 10^4 deg^2 survey with ~15 background sources per square
degree and a signal-to-noise of ~5 per pixel should achieve a measurement of
the BAO scale to within ~1.4 per cent. We also use our simulations to provide
simple power-law expressions for estimating the fractional error on the BAO
scale on varying the signal-to-noise and the number density of background
sources. The speed and flexibility of our approach is well suited for exploring
parameter space and the impact of observational and astrophysical systematics
on the recovery of the BAO signature from forthcoming large scale spectroscopic
surveys.

Extensive simulations of the SU(3) gauge theory, using the HMC and the closely

molecular evolution. But what are the modes of sequence evolution leading to
rapid formation and loss of regulatory sites? Here, we show that a large
fraction of neighboring transcription factor binding sites in the fly genome
have formed from a common sequence origin by local duplications. This mode of
evolution is found to produce regulatory information: duplications can seed new
sites in the neighborhood of existing sites. Duplicate seeds evolve
subsequently by point mutations, often towards binding a different factor than
their ancestral neighbor sites. These results are based on a statistical
analysis of 346 cis-regulatory modules in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,
and a comparison set of intergenic regulatory sequence in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. In fly regulatory modules, pairs of binding sites show
significantly enhanced sequence similarity up to distances of about 50 bp. We
analyze these data in terms of an evolutionary model with two distinct modes of
site formation: (i) evolution from independent sequence origin and (ii)
divergent evolution following duplication of a common ancestor sequence. Our
results suggest that pervasive formation of binding sites by local sequence
duplications distinguishes the complex regulatory architecture of higher
eukaryotes from the simpler architecture of unicellular organisms.

the second effect, which occurs with increased anharmonicity or higher

comment on the implications for quantum information processing and quantum

gravitationally contracting molecular clouds (MCs) and their star formation
rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE). The model assumes that the instantaneous SFR
is given by the mass above a certain density threshold divided by its free-fall
time. The instantaneous number of massive stars is computed assuming a Kroupa
IMF. These stars feed back on the cloud through ionizing radiation, eroding it.
The main controlling parameter of the evolution turns out to be the maximum
cloud mass, $\Mmax$. This allows us to compare various properties of the model
clouds against their observational counterparts. A giant molecular cloud (GMC)
model ($\Mmax \sim 10^5 \Msun$) adheres very well to the evolutionary scenario
recently inferred by Kawamura et al. (2009) for GMCs in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. A model cloud with $\Mmax \approx 2000 \Msun$ evolves in the
Kennicutt-Schmidt diagram first passing through the locus of typical low-
to-intermediate mass star-forming clouds, and then moving towards the locus of
high-mass star-forming ones over the course of $\sim 10$ Myr. Also, the stellar
age histograms for this cloud a few Myr before its destruction agree very well
with those observed in the $\rho$-Oph stellar association, whose parent cloud
has a similar mass, and imply that the SFR of the clouds increases with time.
Our model thus agrees well with various observed properties of star-forming
MCs, suggesting that the scenario of gravitationally collapsing MCs, with their
SFR regulated by stellar feedback, is entirely feasible and in agreement with
key observed properties of molecular clouds.

baseline, which exploited the microbunching from the planar undulator. After
the baseline undulator, the electron beam is transported through a drift by a
FODO focusing system, and through a short helical radiator. The microbunching
structure can be preserved, and intense coherent radiation is emitted in the
helical undulator at fundamental harmonic. The driving idea of this proposal is
that the background linearly-polarized radiation from the baseline undulator is
suppressed by spatial filtering. Filtering is achieved by letting radiation and
electron beam through Be slits upstream of the helical radiator, where the
radiation spot size is about ten times larger than the electron beam transverse
size. Several changes considered in the present paper were made to improve the
previous design. Slits are now placed immediately behind the helical radiator.
The advantage is that the electron beam can be spoiled by the slits, and
narrower slits width can be used for spatial filtering. Due to this fundamental
reason, the present setup is shorter than the previous one. The helical
radiator is now placed immediately behind the SHAB undulator. It is thus
sufficient to use the existing FODO focusing system of the SHAB undulator for
transporting the modulated electron beam. This paper presents complete GENESIS
code calculations for the new design, starting from the baseline undulator
entrance up to the helical radiator exit including the modulated electron beam
transport by the SHAB FODO focusing system.

anomalous decoherence effect for the electron spin-1 of a nitrogen-vacancy

dynamical decoupling, the double-transition can have longer coherence time than
the single-transition, even though the former couples to the nuclear spin bath
as twice strongly as the latter does. The excellent agreement between the
experimental and the theoretical results confirms the controllability of the
weakly coupled nuclear spins in the bath, which is useful in quantum
information processing and quantum metrology.

discovered class of three dimensional topologically ordered electronic systems,
and feature robust, massless spin-helical conducting surface states that appear
at any interface between a topological insulator and normal matter that lacks
the topological insulator ordering. This topologically defined surface
environment has been theoretically identified as a promising platform for
observing a wide range of new physical phenomena, and possesses ideal
properties for advanced electronics such as spin-polarized conductivity and
suppressed scattering. A key missing step in enabling these applications is to
understand how topologically ordered electrons respond to the interfaces and
surface structures that constitute a device. Here we explore this question by
using the surface deposition of cathode (Cu/In/Fe) and anode materials (NO$_2$)
and control of bulk doping in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ from P-type to N-type charge
transport regimes to generate a range of topological insulator interface
scenarios that are fundamental to device development. The interplay of
conventional semiconductor junction physics and three dimensional topological
electronic order is observed to generate novel junction behaviors that go
beyond the doped-insulator paradigm of conventional semiconductor devices and
greatly alter the known spin-orbit interface phenomenon of Rashba splitting.
Our measurements for the first time reveal new classes of diode-like
configurations that can create a gap in the interface electron density near a
topological Dirac point and systematically modify the topological surface state
Dirac velocity, allowing far reaching control of spin-textured helical Dirac
electrons inside the interface and creating advantages for TI superconductors
as a Majorana fermion platform over spin-orbit semiconductors.

these are due to luminescence of large carbonaceous molecules. Polarised
signals of several percent could be expected from certain asymmetric molecular
rotators. The ESPaDOnS echelle spectrograph mounted at the CFHT was used to
obtain high-resolution optical spectropolarimetric data of the Red Rectangle
nebular emission. The RRBs at 5800, 5850, and 6615 Angstrom are detected in
spectra of the nebular emission 7"" and 13"" North-East from the central star.
The 5826 and 6635 Angstrom RRB are detected only at the position nearest to the
central star. For both positions the Stokes Q and U spectra show no unambiguous
polarisation signal in any of the RRBs. We derive an upper limit of 0.02% line
polarisation for these RRBs. A tentative feature with peak polarisation of
0.05% is seen for the 5800 RRB at 7"" offset. However, the Null spectra suggest
that this may be an instrumental artifact. The lack of a clear polarisation
signal for the five detected RRBs implies that, if the emission is due to
luminescence of complex organics, these gas-phase molecular carriers are likely
to have a high degree of symmetry, as they do not exhibit a Q-branch in their
rotational profile, although this may be modified by statistical effects.

resolution long-slit spectroscopy along their major axes (and along the minor

All the studied galaxies lie on the mass-metallicity and age-mass relations.
The transition type dwarfs deviate from the latter relation having younger mean
age, and the low-mass dwarf spheroidals have older ages, marking a
discontinuity in the relation, possibly due to selection effects.
  In all mass regimes, the mean metallicity gradients are approximately -0.2
and the mean age gradients +0.1 dex per decade of radius. The individual
gradients are widely spread: $ -0.1 < \nabla_{\rm Age} < 0.4 $ and $-0.54 <
\nabla_{[{\rm Fe/H}]} < +0.2 $. We do not find evidence for a correlation
between the metallicity gradient and luminosity, velocity dispersion, central
age or age gradient. Likewise, we do not find a correlation between the age
gradient and any other parameter in bright early-type galaxies. In faint
early-types with $M_B \gtrsim -17$ mag, on the other hand, we find a
correlation between the age gradient and luminosity: the age gradient becomes
more positive for fainter galaxies.
  We conclude that various physical mechanisms can lead to similar gradients
and that these gradients are robust against the environmental effects. In
particular, the gradients observed in dwarfs galaxies certainly survived the
transformation of the progenitors through tidal harassment or/and ram-pressure
stripping. The diversity of metallicity gradients amongst dwarf elliptical
galaxies may reflect a plurality of progenitors' morphologies. The dwarfs with
steep metallicity gradients could have originated from blue compact dwarfs and
those with flat profiles from dwarf irregulars and late type spirals.

coupled cell networks. This allows us to give a simple proof of Theorem 10.3 of
Aquiar and Dias ""Minimal Coupled Cell Networks"", which characterizes minimal
identical edge homogeneous coupled cell networks. Using our criterion we give a
formula for counting homogeneous coupled cell networks up to ODE equivalence.
Our criterion is purely graph theoretic and makes no explicit use of linear
algebra.

Velocity Distribution (MVD) is proposed. We construct an operator that governs
the discrete time evolution of the velocity distribution. This operator, which
conserves the momentum and the energy of the ideal gas, has the MVD as a fixed
point. Moreover, for any initial out-of-equilibrium velocity distribution, it
is shown that the gas decays to the equilibrium distribution, that is, to the
MVD.

quadripartite polarization-entangled cluster state, using macroscopic atomic
ensembles in a magnetic field. The Larmor precession of the atomic spins leads
to a symmetry between the atomic canonical operators. In this scheme, each of
the four spatially separated pulses passes twice through the respective
ensemble in order to map the polarization-entangled cluster state onto the
long-lived atomic ensembles. The stored state can then be retrieved by another
four read-out pulses, each crossing the respective ensemble twice. By
calculating the variances, we analyzed the fidelities of the storage and
retrieval, and our scheme is feasible under realistic experimental conditions.

representations of symmetries of physical systems. We argue that quantum
behavior is a natural result of extraction of ""observable"" information about
systems containing ""unobservable"" elements in their descriptions. Since our aim
is physics where the choice between finite and infinite descriptions can not
have any empirical consequences, we consider the problem in the finite
background. Besides, there are many indications from observations - from the
lepton mixing data, for example - that finite groups underly phenomena in
particle physics at the deep level. The ""finite"" approach allows to reduce any
quantum dynamics to the simple permutation dynamics, and thus to express
quantum observables in terms of permutation invariants of symmetry groups and
their integer characteristics such as sizes of conjugate classes, sizes of
group orbits, class coefficients, dimensions of representations. Our study has
been accompanied by computations with finite groups, their representations and
invariants. We have used both our C implementation of algorithms for working
with groups and computer algebra system GAP.
