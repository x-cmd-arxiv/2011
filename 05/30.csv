justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are
consistent with an audit trail (""ballots""), which can be paper or electronic.
SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately
for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome
is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy;
(2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to
prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the
accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of
contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping
between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs
that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt
County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for
individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy.
Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials.
Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the ""super-simple
simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit."" Step (3) is designed to reveal
relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs
accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests
differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is
guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by
hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official
and final.

Consequently, the construction of Meir can be taken over any field, including

classification scheme for these intricate orbits in terms of periodic orbits.
The crucial insight is that for a given effective angular momentum $L$ and
angle of inclination $\iota$, there exists a discrete set of orbits that are
geometrically $n$-leaf clovers in a precessing {\it orbital plane}. When viewed
in the full three dimensions, these orbits are periodic in $r-\theta$. Each
$n$-leaf clover is associated with a rational number,
$1+q_{r\theta}=\omega_\theta/\omega_r$, that measures the degree of perihelion
precession in the precessing orbital plane. The rational number $q_{r\theta}$
varies monotonically with the orbital energy and with the orbital eccentricity.
Since any bound orbit can be approximated as near one of these periodic
$n$-leaf clovers, this special set offers a skeleton that illuminates the
structure of all bound Kerr orbits, in or out of the equatorial plane.

infinite dimensional groups of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms Ham(M,\om) of closed

the bone marrow where erythroid cells proliferate and differentiate within
particular structures, called erythroblastic islands. A typical structure of
these islands consists in a macrophage (white cell) surrounded by immature
erythroid cells (progenitors), with more mature cells on the periphery of the
island, ready to leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream. A hybrid
model, coupling a continuous model (ordinary differential equations) describing
intracellular regulation through competition of two key proteins, to a discrete
spatial model describing cell-cell interactions, with growth factor diffusion
in the medium described by a continuous model (partial differential equations),
is proposed to investigate the role of the central macrophage in normal
erythropoiesis. Intracellular competition of the two proteins leads the
erythroid cell to either proliferation, differentiation, or death by apoptosis.
This approach allows considering spatial aspects of erythropoiesis, involved
for instance in the occurrence of cellular interactions or the access to
external factors, as well as dynamics of intracellular and extracellular scales
of this complex cellular process, accounting for stochasticity in cell cycle
durations and orientation of the mitotic spindle. The analysis of the model
shows a strong effect of the central macrophage on the stability of an
erythroblastic island, when assuming the macrophage releases pro-survival
cytokines. Even though it is not clear whether or not erythroblastic island
stability must be required, investigation of the model concludes that stability
improves responsiveness of the model, hence stressing out the potential
relevance of the central macrophage in normal erythropoiesis.

in the case where h = n, making the identifiers of robots invisible does not
limit their computational power. This contradicts a result of [4]. To present
our algorithms, we use a function that computes the Weber point for many

to the soft limit are estimated by combining results from single-particle
inclusive and pair invariant-mass kinematics. We present our predictions as

an illustrative example.

are not preferably found in barred galaxies, a fact that points to the
relevance of formation mechanisms different to the traditional bar-origin
scenario. In contrast, the role of minor mergers in the formation of these
inner components (ICs), while often invoked, is still poorly understood. We
have investigated the capability of minor mergers to trigger the formation of
IDs and IRs in spiral galaxies through collisionless N-body simulations. We
have run a battery of minor mergers in which both primary and secondary are
modelled as disc-bulge-halo galaxies with realistic density ratios. A detailed
analysis of the morphology, structure, and kinematics of the ICs resulting from
the minor merger has been carried out. All the simulated minor mergers develop
thin ICs out of satellite material, supported by rotation. A wide morphological
zoo of ICs has been obtained (including IDs, IRs, pseudo-rings, nested IDs,
spiral patterns, and combinations of them), but all with structural and
kinematical properties similar to observations. The existence of the resulting
ICs can be deduced through the features that they imprint in the isophotal
profiles and kinemetric maps of the final remnant, as in many real galaxies.
The realistic density ratios used in the present models make the satellites to
experience more efficient orbital circularization and disruption than in
previous studies. Combined with the disc resonances induced by the encounter,
these processes give place to highly aligned co- and counter-rotating ICs in
the remnant centre. Therefore, minor mergers are an efficient mechanism to form
rotationally-supported stellar ICs in spiral galaxies, neither requiring strong
dissipation nor the development of noticeable bars (abridged).

system prevent a particle from occupying an otherwise accessible quantum state.
Blockade phenomena reveal the underlying granular nature of quantum systems and
allow the detection and manipulation of the constituent particles, whether they
are electrons, spins, atoms, or photons. The diverse applications range from
single-electron transistors based on electronic Coulomb blockade to quantum
logic gates in Rydberg atoms. We have observed a new kind of interaction
blockade in transferring ultracold atoms between orbitals in an optical
lattice. In this system, atoms on the same lattice site undergo coherent
collisions described by a contact interaction whose strength depends strongly
on the orbital wavefunctions of the atoms. We induce coherent orbital
excitations by modulating the lattice depth and observe a staircase-type
excitation behavior as we cross the interaction-split resonances by tuning the
modulation frequency. As an application of orbital excitation blockade (OEB),
we demonstrate a novel algorithmic route for cooling quantum gases. Our
realization of algorithmic cooling utilizes a sequence of reversible OEB-based
quantum operations that isolate the entropy in one part of the system, followed
by an irreversible step that removes the entropy from the gas. This work opens
the door to cooling quantum gases down to ultralow entropies, with implications
for developing a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated electron
systems that can be simulated in optical lattices. In addition, the close
analogy between OEB and dipole blockade in Rydberg atoms provides a roadmap for
the implementation of two-qubit gates in a quantum computing architecture with
natural scalability.

produced insights on cosmic events. The simultaneous observation of
electromagnetic and/or neutrino emission could be important evidence in the
first direct detection of gravitational radiation. Knowledge of event time,
source sky location, and the expected frequency range of the signal enhances
our ability to search for the gravitational radiation signatures with an
amplitude closer to the noise floor of the detector. Presented here is a
summary of the status of LIGO-Virgo multimessenger detection efforts, along
with a discussion of questions that might be resolved using the data from
advanced or third generation gravitational wave detector networks.

promoting renewable energies and other AGW-motivated measures. In absence of

avoided by using the LLL subtraction method that we have applied to the

the final-state QED divergence that appears in the $qg \rightarrow \gamma\gamma

properties of the Galactic thick disk. In this scenario, the dynamical
properties of the thick disk have long been influenced both by the mass growth
of the second generation of the Galactic thin disk (i.e., the present thin
disk) and by its non-axisymmetric structures. On the other hand, the early star
formation history and chemical evolution of the thin disk was influenced by the
remaining gas of the thick disk. Based on N-body simulations and chemical
evolution models, we investigate the radial metallicity gradient, structural
and kinematical properties, and detailed chemical abundance patterns of the
thick disk. Our numerical simulations show that the ancient minor merger event
can significantly flatten the original radial metallicity gradient of the FGTD,
in particular, in the outer part, and also can be responsible for migration of
inner metal-rich stars into the outer part (R>10kpc). The simulations show that
the central region of the thick disk can develop a bar due to dynamical effects
of a separate bar in the thin disk. The simulated orbital eccentricity
distributions in the thick disk for models with higher mass-ratios (~0.2) and
lower orbital eccentricities (~ 0.5) of minor mergers are in good agreement

radius, have curiously sharp outer edges where the radio-synchrotron continuum
flux declines abruptly. However, just adjacent to this sharp transition, the
radio flux increases. This radio limb-brightening is observed over at least
half of the perimeter of both lobes. We describe slowly propagating steady
state diffusion fronts that explain these counterintuitive features. Because of
the natural buoyancy of radio lobes, the magnetic field is largely tangent to
the lobe boundary, an alignment that polarizes the radio emission and
dramatically reduces the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. As
cosmic ray electrons diffuse slowly into the cluster gas, the local magnetic
field and gas density are reduced as gas flows back toward the radio lobe.
Radio emission peaks can occur because the synchrotron emissivity increases
with magnetic field and then decreases with the density of non-thermal
electrons. A detailed comparison of steady diffusion fronts with quantitative
radio observations may reveal information about the spatial variation of
magnetic fields and the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. On
larger scales, some reduction of the gas density inside the Virgo lobes due to
cosmic ray pressure must occur and may be measurable. Such X-ray observations
could reveal important information about the presence of otherwise unobservable
non-thermal components such as relativistic electrons of low energy or proton
cosmic rays.

black holes can be estimated by comparing the potential energy of observed

hot gas atmospheres resulting from gravitational collapse in clusters of the
same total mass. Feedback energy from cluster-centered black holes expands the
cluster gas, lowering the gas-to-dark matter mass ratio below the cosmic value.
Feedback energy is unnecessarily delivered by radio-emitting jets to distant
gas far beyond the cooling radius where the cooling time equals the cluster
lifetime. For clusters of mass 4-11 X 10^14 Msun estimates of the total
feedback energy, 1-3 X 10^63 ergs, far exceed feedback energies estimated from
observations of X-ray cavities and shocks in the cluster gas, energies gained
from supernovae, and energies lost from cluster gas by radiation. The
time-averaged mean feedback luminosity is comparable to those of powerful
quasars, implying that some significant fraction of this energy may arise from
the spin of the black hole. The universal entropy profile in feedback-free
gaseous atmospheres in NFW cluster halos can be recovered by multiplying the
observed gas entropy profile of any relaxed cluster by a factor involving the
gas fraction profile. While the feedback energy and associated mass outflow in
the clusters we consider far exceed that necessary to stop cooling inflow, the
time-averaged mass outflow at the cooling radius almost exactly balances the

cooling flows.

markers or tags. Individuals interact with each of their neighbours on a square
lattice by either cooperating by donating some benefit at a cost to themselves
or defecting by doing nothing. The decision to cooperate or defect is
contingent on each individual's perception of its interacting partner's tag.
Unlike in other tag-based models individuals do not compare their own tag to
that of their interaction partner. That is, there is no {\em self-matching}.
When perception is perfect the cooperation rate is substantially higher than in
the usual spatial prisoner's dilemma game when the cost of cooperation is high.
The enhancement in cooperation is positively correlated with the number of
different tags. The more diverse a population is the more cooperative it
becomes. When individuals start with an inability to perceive tags the
population evolves to a state where individuals gain at least partial
perception. With some reproduction mechanisms perfect perception evolves, but
with others the ability to perceive tags is imperfect. We find that perception
of tags evolves to lower levels when the cost of cooperation is higher.

overdensity of red galaxies matching the X-ray emission. The cluster was
spectroscopically confirmed to be at z=1.579 using ground-based VLT/FORS2
spectroscopy. The analysis of the I-H colour-magnitude diagram shows a sequence
of red galaxies with a colour range [3.7 < I-H < 4.6] within 1' from the
cluster X-ray emission peak. However, the three spectroscopic members (all with
complex morphology) have significantly bluer colours relative to the observed
red-sequence. In addition, two of the three cluster members have [OII]
emission, indicative of on-going star formation. Using the spectroscopic
redshift we estimated the X-ray bolometric luminosity, Lbol = 5.8x10^44 erg/s,

runaway merger in dense star clusters, where main-sequence stars collide and
form a very massive star (VMS), which then collapses to a black hole. In this
paper we study the effects of primordial mass segregation and the importance of
the stellar initial mass function (IMF) on the runaway growth of VMSs using a
dynamical Monte Carlo code for N-body systems with N as high as 10^6 stars. Our
code now includes an explicit treatment of all stellar collisions. We place
special emphasis on the possibility of top-heavy IMFs, as observed in some very
young massive clusters. We find that both primordial mass segregation and the
shape of the IMF affect the rate of core collapse of star clusters and thus the
time of the runaway. When we include primordial mass segregation we generally
see a decrease in core collapse time (tcc). Moreover, primordial mass
segregation increases the average mass in the core, thus reducing the central
relaxation time, which also decreases tcc. The final mass of the VMS formed is
always close to \sim 10^-3 of the total cluster mass, in agreement with the
previous studies and is reminiscent of the observed correlation between the
central black hole mass and the bulge mass of the galaxies. As the degree of
primordial mass segregation is increased, the mass of the VMS increases at most
by a factor of 3. Flatter IMFs generally increase the average mass in the whole
cluster, which increases tcc. For the range of IMFs investigated in this paper,
this increase in tcc is to some degree balanced by stellar collisions, which
accelerate core collapse. Thus there is no significant change in tcc for the
somewhat flatter global IMFs observed in very young massive clusters.

E^{\alpha}, we find {\alpha} = -1.34 \pm 0.12, implying a very sharp break with
the spectrum above a few GeV. This then predicts a synchrotron brightness
temperature spectral index, {\beta}, on the Galactic plane that is -2.8 <
{\beta} < -2.74 below a few GHz and -2.98 < {\beta} < -2.91 up to 23 GHz. We
find that models including cosmic-ray re-acceleration processes appear to be
incompatible with the synchrotron data.

dimension. Solutions exist for two specific structures of inverse covariance :
sparse and circulant. The proposed approach is valid in a more general case and
especially as it emerges in inverse problems. It relies on a
perturbation-optimization principle: adequate stochastic perturbation of a
criterion and optimization of the perturbed criterion. It is shown that the
criterion minimizer is a sample of the target density. The motivation in
inverse problems is related to general (non-convolutive) linear observation
models and their resolution in a Bayesian framework implemented through
sampling algorithms when existing samplers are not feasible. It finds a direct
application in myopic and/or unsupervised inversion as well as in some
non-Gaussian inversion. An illustration focused on hyperparameter estimation
for super-resolution problems assesses the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

the poor countries always export very few kinds of products as we expect.
Second, once the economic size (GDP) of a country is beyond a threshold, its
export diversity may increase dramatically. However, this is not the case for
rich countries because a ceiling on the export diversity is observed when their
GDPs are higher than another threshold. This pattern is very stable for
different years although the concrete parameters of the fitting sigmoid

measurements of the consumption of HMDSO. Additionally, the localized nature of
the jet-substrate interaction is utilized to study surface reactions by
applying two jets on a rotating substrate. The addition of oxygen into the gas
mixture increases HMDSO depletion and the growth rate and results in the
deposition of carbon free films. The surface reaction is responsible for the
carbon removal from the growing film. Moreover, carbon free films can be
deposited even without addition of oxygen, when coaxial jet operated with argon
is used for the surface treatment. We hypothesize that ions or excited species

continuous-wave laser light in a nonlinear cavity containing a periodically
poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal (PPKTP). The fundamental field had a
power of 1.10 W and was converted into 1.05 W at 775 nm, yielding a total
external conversion efficiency of (95 \pm 1)%. The latter value is based on the
measured depletion of the fundamental field being consistent with the absolute
values derived from numerical simulations. According to our model, the
conversion efficiency achieved was limited by the non-perfect mode-matching
into the nonlinear cavity and the pump power available. Our result shows that
cavity-assisted frequency conversion based on PPKTP is well suited for
low-decoherence frequency conversion of quantum states of light.

also modelled the chemical evolution of TMC-1 adopting physical conditions
typical of dark clouds using the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry gas-phase

ratios. The CH column density has a clear peak in the vicinity of the
cyanopolyyne maximum of TMC-1. The fractional CH abundance relative to H2
increases steadily from the northwestern end of the filament where it lies
around 1.0e-8, to the southeast where it reaches a value of 2.0e-8. The OH and
CH column densities are well correlated, and we obtained OH/CH abundance ratios
of ~ 16 - 20. These values are clearly larger than what has been measured
recently in diffuse interstellar gas and is likely to be related to C to CO
conversion at higher densities. The good correlation between CH and OH can be
explained by similar production and destruction pathways. We suggest that the
observed CH and OH abundance gradients are mainly due to enhanced abundances in
a low-density envelope which becomes more prominent in the southeastern part
and seems to continue beyond the dense filament. An extensive envelope probably
signifies an early stage of dynamical evolution, and conforms with the
detection of a large CH abundance in the southeastern part of the cloud. The
implied presence of other simple forms of carbon in the gas phase provides a
natural explanation for the observation of ""early-type"" molecules in this
region.

(Compressive Sampling). Since 1/f property implies power law decay of the fBm
spectrum, the fBm signals should be sparse in frequency domain. This property
motivates the adoption of CS in the development of the reconstruction method.
Hurst parameter H that occurs in the power law determines the sparsity level,
therefore the CS reconstruction quality of an fBm signal for a given number of
known subsamples will depend on H. However, the proposed method does not
require the information of H to reconstruct the fBm signal from its partial
samples. The method employs DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) as the sparsity
basis and a random matrix derived from known samples positions as the
projection basis. Simulated fBm signals with various values of H are used to
show the relationship between the Hurst parameter and the reconstruction
quality. Additionally, US-DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) stock index

around the 30 Doradus (30 Dor) region in the Large Magellanic Cloud obtained
with the Fourier Transform Spectrometer of the Far-Infrared Surveyor onboard
AKARI. The map reveals that the [OIII] emission is widely distributed by more
than 10' around the super star cluster R136, implying that the 30 Dor region is
affluent with interstellar radiation field hard enough to ionize O^{2+}. The
observed [OIII] line intensities are as high as (1-2) x 10^{-6} W m^{-2}
sr^{-1} on the peripheral regions 4'-5' away from the center of 30 Dor, which
requires gas densities of 60-100 cm^{-3}. However the observed size of the
distribution of the [OIII] emission is too large to be explained by massive
stars in the 30 Dor region enshrouded by clouds with the constant gas density
of 10^2 cm^{-3}. Therefore the surrounding structure is likely to be highly
clumpy. We also find a global correlation between the [OIII] and the
far-infrared continuum emission, suggesting that the gas and dust are well
mixed in the highly-ionized region where the dust survives in clumpy dense
clouds shielded from the energetic photons.

of hypothetical 2D, so-called, ""master-space"" (MS), subject to certain rules.
The MS, embedded in the background 4D-spacetime, is an indispensable individual
companion to the particle of interest, without relation to every other
particle. We argue that a deformation/(distortion of local internal properties)
of MS is the origin of inertia. With this perspective in sight, we construct
the alternative relativistic theory of inertia (RTI), which allows to compute
the relativistic inertial force acting on an arbitrary point-like observer due
to its ""absolute acceleration"". We go beyond the hypothesis of locality with an
emphasis on distortion of MS, which allows to improve essentially the standard
metric and other relevant geometrical structures related to the noninertial
reference frame of an arbitrary accelerated observer. We compute the inertial
force exerted on the photon in a gravitating system in the semi-Riemann space.
Despite the totally different and independent physical sources of gravitation
and inertia, this approach furnishes justification for the introduction of the
principle of equivalence. Consequently, we relate the inertia effects to the
more general post-Riemannian geometry. We derive a general expression of the
relativistic inertial force exerted on the extended spinning body moving in the
Rieman-Cartan space.

the number of update operations, $w$ the cell size, $t_q$ the query time and

crucial in order to reduce them as much as possible. We present, then, the
sensitivity of the considered NF setups to the NSI parameters, paying special
attention to correlations arising between them and the standard oscillation
parameters, when all NSI parameters are introduced at once. Off-diagonal NSI
parameters could be tested down to the level of $10^{-3}$, whereas the diagonal
combinations $(\epsilon_{ee} - \epsilon_{\tau\tau})$ and
$(\epsilon_{\mu\mu}-\epsilon_{\tau\tau})$ can be tested down to $10^{-1}$ and
$10^{-2}$, respectively. The possibilities of observing CP violation in this

potential of the NF setups to the phases $\phi_{e\mu}, \phi_{e\tau}$ and
$\delta$. We study separately the case where CP violation comes only from
non-standard sources, and the case where it is entangled with the standard
source, $\delta$. In case $\delta$ turns out to be CP conserving, the
interesting possibility of observing CP violation for reasonably small values

determining the precise aircraft positions via a VHF channel with an air-to-air

long propagation delay, the existing TDMA MAC schemes underutilize the
networks. The existing TDMA MAC sends data and receives ACK in one time slot,
which requires two guard times in one time slot. Since aeronautical
communications spans a significant distance, the guard time occupies a
significantly large portion of the slot. To solve this problem, we propose a
piggybacking mechanism ACK. Our proposed MAC has one guard time in one time
slot, which enables the transmission of more data. Using this additional data,
we can send weather conditions that pertain to the aircraft's current position.
Our analysis shows that this proposed MAC performs better than the existing
MAC, since it offers better throughput and network utilization. In addition,
our weather condition notification model achieves a much lower transmission
delay than a HF (high frequency) voice communication.

such optical eigenmode imaging does not need any a priori knowledge of the

high image extraction efficiencies. Finally, we discuss the implications with

transition, produces droplets of sizes of the order of microns and mean
separations between droplets of the order of tens of microns. These relatively
large length scales are because of the weak destabilizing van der Waals forces
and the high surface energy penalty required for deformations on small scales.
We show a simple, one-step versatile method to fabricate sub-micron (>~100 nm)
droplets and their ordered arrays by room temperature dewetting of ultrathin
polystyrene (PS) films by minimizing these limitations. This is achieved by
controlled room temperature dewetting under an optimal mixture of water,
acetone and methyl-ethyl ketone (MEK). Diffusion of organic solvents in the
film greatly reduces its glass transition temperature and the interfacial
tension, but enhances the destabilizing field by introduction of electrostatic
force. The latter is reflected in a change in the exponent, n of the
instability length scale, {\lambda} ~h^n, where h is the film thickness and n =
1.51 \pm 0.06 in the case of water-solvent mix, as opposed to its value of 2.19
\pm 0.07 for dewetting in air. The net outcome is more than one order of
magnitude reduction in the droplet size as well as their mean separation and
also a much faster dynamics of dewetting. We also demonstrate the use of this
technique for controlled dewetting on topographically patterned substrates with
submicrometer features where dewetting in air is either arrested, incomplete or
unable to produce ordered patterns.

system with two capacitively coupled parallel transport channels. Each channel
is composed of a quantum dot connected by tunneling to two reservoirs. The
nonequilibrium steady state of the system is controlled by two affinities or
thermodynamic forces, each one determined by the two reservoirs of each
channel. The status of a single-current fluctuation theorem is investigated
starting from the fundamental two-current fluctuation theorem, which is a
consequence of microreversibility. We show that the single-current fluctuation
theorem holds in the limit of a large Coulomb repulsion between the two
parallel quantum dots, as well as in the limit of a large current ratio between
the parallel channels. In this latter limit, the symmetry relation of the
single-current fluctuation theorem is satisfied with respect to an effective
affinity that is much lower than the affinity determined by the reservoirs.
This back-action effect is quantitatively characterized.

In the discrete memoryless case, we establish inner and outer bounds on the
capacity region. Although the encoder that sends both messages knows the states
fully, we show that the strictly causal knowledge of these states at the other
encoder can be beneficial for this encoder, and in general enlarges the
capacity region. Furthermore, we find an explicit characterization of the
capacity in the case in which the two encoders transmit only the common
message. In the Gaussian case, we characterize the capacity region for the
model with individual message as well. Our converse proof in this case shows
that, for this model, strictly causal knowledge of the state at one of the
encoders does not increase capacity if the other is informed non-causally, a
result which sheds more light on the utility of conveying a compressed version
of the state to the decoder in recent results by Lapidoth and Steinberg on a
multiacess model with only strictly causal state at both encoders and

oxygen emission line due to strong heating of the upper atmosphere during the
storm time, while the latter is dominated by a sum of C V, C VI, N VI, N VII, O

decrease of the intrinsic absorption with time. Using Suzaku observations it is
possible to constrain the amount of Compton reflection to R = 0.6-1.0, in
agreement with previous results on the source. The signature of Comptonisation
processes can also be found in the detection of a high-energy cut-off during

Hence, it should be the subject of more research. Our starting point is the
observation that traditional database design is not used in practice - and if
it were used it would result in designs that are not well adapted to current
environments. In short, database design has failed to keep up with the times.

photon-to-pion transition form factor in the holographic QCD approach. First
the holographic description of the anomalous \gamma^*\gamma^*\pi^0 form factor
is reviewed and applied to various models. It is illustrated that in describing
the anomalous form factor, the holographic approach is asymptotically dual to
the perturbative QCD (pQCD) framework, with the pion mode \pi(z)\sim z
corresponding to the asymptotic pion distribution amplitude. This indicates
some inconsistency in light-front holography, since \pi(z)\sim z would be dual
to \varphi(x)\sim \sqrt{x(1-x)} there. After clarifying these subtleties, we
employ the relation between the holographic and the perturbative expressions to
study possible asymptotic violation of the transition form factor. It is found
that if one require that the asymptotic form factor possess a pQCD-like
expression, the pion mode can only be ultraviolet-enhanced by logarithmic
factors. The minimally deformed pion mode will then be of the form \pi(z)\sim
z\ln (z\Lambda)^{-1}. We suppose that this deformation may be due to the
coupling of the pion with a nontrivial open string tachyon field, and then the
parameter $\Lambda$ will be related to the quark condensate. Interestingly,
this pion mode leads immediately to Radyushkin's logarithmic model, which
fitted very well the experimental data in the large-Q^2 region. On the other
side, the pQCD interpretation with a flat-like pion distribution amplitude,
proposed by Radyushkin and Polyakov, fails to possess a holographic expression.

scattering, in the framework of the gauge/gravity correspondence in a confining
background. On the gauge theory side, Reggeon exchange is described as
quark-antiquark exchange in the t channel between fast projectiles. The
corresponding amplitude is represented in terms of Wilson loops running along
the trajectories of the constituent quarks and antiquarks. The paths of the
exchanged fermions are integrated over, while the ""spectator"" fermions are
dealt with in an eikonal approximation. On the gravity side, we follow a
previously proposed approach, and we evaluate the Wilson-loop expectation value
by making use of gauge/gravity duality for a generic confining gauge theory.
The amplitude is obtained in a saddle-point approximation through the
determination near the confining horizon of a Euclidean ""minimal surface with
floating boundaries"", i.e., by fixing the trajectories of the exchanged quark
and antiquark by means of a minimisation procedure, which involves both area
and length terms. After discussing, as a warm-up exercise, a simpler problem on
a plane involving a soap film with floating boundaries, we solve the
variational problem relevant to Reggeon exchange, in which the basic geometry
is that of a helicoid. A compact expression for the Reggeon-exchange amplitude,
including the effects of a small fermion mass, is then obtained through
analytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowski space-time. We find in
particular a linear Regge trajectory, corresponding to a Regge-pole singularity
supplemented by a logarithmic cut induced by the non-zero quark mass. The
analytic continuation leads also to companion contributions, corresponding to
the convolution of the same Reggeon-exchange amplitude with multiple elastic
rescattering interactions between the colliding mesons.

empirically selecting the parameters of the neural network, i.e. the learning
rate, activation function parameter, momentum number, the number of nodes in

comparatively better combination of these parameters. We also introduce another
way to perform back propagation. Instead of using the partial differential of

pressure radio-frequency micro-plasma jet were measured using tunable diode
laser absorption spectroscopy. The spatial profile of metastable atoms in the
volume between the electrodes was deduced for various electrode gap distances.
Density profiles reveal the sheath structure and reflect the plasma excitation
distribution, as well as the dominance of the alpha-mode discharge. Gap width
variations show the transition from a normal glow plasma to a pure sheath
discharge. In order to analyze and verify the experimentally observed profiles
of the metastable atoms a 2-dimensional simulation model was set up. Applying
an appropriate He/N2/O2 chemistry model the correlation between the metastable
profiles and the underlying excitation mechanisms was obtained.

symmetric quantum phases in S=1 spin chains %/ladders which respect a discrete
spin rotation $D_2 \subset SO(3)$ and time reversal $T$ symmetries. In this
paper, using a generalized approach, we study all the 16 possible gapped
symmetric quantum phases of 1D integer spin systems with only $D_2+T$ symmetry.
Those phases are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory and cannot be
characterized by local order parameters, since they do not break any symmetry.
They correspond to 16 symmetry protected topological (SPT) orders. We show that
all the 16 SPT orders can be fully characterized by the physical properties of
the symmetry protected degenerate boundary states (end `spins') at the ends of
a chain segment. So we can measure and distinguish all the 16 SPT orders
experimentally. We also show that all these SPT orders can be realized in S=1
spin ladder models. The gapped symmetric phases protected by subgroups of
$D_2+T$ are also studied. Again, all these phases can be distinguished by
physically measuring their end `spins'.

this fractional derivative we define the generalized fractional
Littlewood-Paley $g$-function for semigroups acting on $L^p$-spaces of
functions with values in Banach spaces. We give a characterization of the
classes of Banach spaces for which the fractional Litlewood-Paley $g$-function
is bounded on $L^p$-spaces. We show that the class of Banach spaces is
independent of the order of derivation and coincides with the classical (Lusin
type/cotype) case. It is also shown that the same kind of results exist for the
case of the fractional area function and the fractional $g^*_\lambda$-function
on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  At last, we consider the relationship of the almost sure finiteness of the
fractional Littlewood-Paley $g$-function, area function and
$g^*_\lambda$-function with the Lusin cotype property of the underlying Banach
space. As a byproduct of the techniques developed, one can get some results of
independent interest for vector-valued Calder\'on--Zygmund operators. For
example, one can get the following characterization, a Banach space
$\mathbb{B}$ is UMD if and only if for some (or, equivalently, for every) $p\in
[1,\infty)$, $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_{|x-y|>

First, DNA oligonucleotides mutually combine by Watson-Crick base pairing rules

the DNA oligonucleotide must match for lattices to form. Here we present a
fabrication scheme of DNA nanostructures with non-complementary and/or
geometrically incompatible DNA oligonucleotides, which contradicts conventional
DNA structure creation rules. Quantitative analyses of DNA lattice sizes were
carried out to verify the unfavorable binding occurrences which correspond to
errors in algorithmic self-assembly. Further studies of these types of bindings
may shed more light on the exact mechanisms at work in the self-assembly of DNA
nanostructures.

section at low energy in a theoretical standpoint. The cross section of
photon-photon scattering at low energy can be written as
$\displaystyle{{d\sigma\over d\Omega} \simeq {\alpha^4\over (12\pi)^2 \omega^2}
(3+2\cos^2\theta +\cos^4\theta)}$ with $\omega$ the energy of photon. The
magnitude of the cross section at $\omega \simeq 1$ eV should be $10^{37}$
times larger than the prediction of Heisenberg and Euler who calculated the
photon scattering by the classical picture of field theory. Due to a difficulty
of the initial condition of photon-photon reaction process, we propose to first
measure $\gamma +\gamma \rightarrow e^++e^- $ reaction at a few MeV before
measuring $\gamma +\gamma \rightarrow \gamma +\gamma $ elastic scattering.
