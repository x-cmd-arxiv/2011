contribution to the Adler relation (AR) is forbidden by conservation of the
lepton current, the heavier states, like the a_1 pole, \rho-\pi-cut, etc.,
control the lifetime of the hadronic fluctuations of the neutrino. We evaluate
the deviation from the AR in diffractive neutrino-production of pions on proton

considerably exceed the size of the target, the AR explicitly breaks down on an
absorptive target, such as a heavy nucleus. In this regime, close to the black
disc limit, the off-diagonal diffractive amplitudes vanish, while the diagonal
one, \pi->\pi, which enters the AR, maximizes and saturates the unitarity
bound. At lower energies, in the regime of short lifetime of heavy hadronic
fluctuations the AR is restored, i.e. it is not altered by the nuclear effects.

reasons why such exponential depletion was never seen in computer simulations.

we use normal form transformation to analyze the worst interacting terms in the

particular, this allows us to conclude that $u-e^{-i t \p_x^2} u(0)\in
H^{-\f{1}{2}}(\rone)$, even though $u(0)\in H^{\be-1+}$.
  In addition and as a byproduct of our normal form analysis, we obtain a

and in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (AGN or
starburst) of these outflows. We report preliminary evidence that ULIRGs with a
higher AGN luminosity (and higher AGN contribution to L_IR) have higher
terminal velocities and shorter gas depletion time scales. The outflows in the
observed ULIRGs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centres of
these objects within ~1E6-1E8 years.

gas and stretch over 80 kpc. They have an unusual low excitation spectrum which
is well modelled by collisional heating and ionization by secondary electrons.
Here we note that the surface radiative flux from the outer filaments is close
to the energy flux impacting on them from particles in the hot gas. We propose
that the secondary electrons within the cold filaments, which excite the
observed submillimetre through UV emission, are due to the hot surrounding gas
efficiently penetrating the cold gas through reconnection diffusion. Some of
the soft X-ray emission seen from the filaments is then due to charge exchange,
although this is insufficient to account for all the observed X-ray flux. The
filaments are complex with multiphase gas. Interpenetration of hot and cold gas
leads to the filaments growing in mass, at a rate of up to 100Msunpyr. The lack
of soft X-ray cooling emission in cool core clusters is then due to the
non-radiative cooling of hot gas on mixing with cold gas around and within the
central galaxy.

However, designing conservative, computable approximations for the behavior of
programs (static analyses) remains a difficult and error-prone process for
modern high-level programming languages. What analysis designers need is a
principled method for navigating the gap between semantics and analytic models:
analysis designers need a method that tames the interaction of complex
languages features such as higher-order functions, recursion, exceptions,
continuations, objects and dynamic allocation.
  We contribute a systematic approach to program analysis that yields novel and
transparently sound static analyses. Our approach relies on existing
derivational techniques to transform high-level language semantics into
low-level deterministic state-transition systems (with potentially infinite
state spaces). We then perform a series of simple machine refactorings to
obtain a sound, computable approximation, which takes the form of a
non-deterministic state-transition systems with finite state spaces. The
approach scales up uniformly to enable program analysis of realistic language
features, including higher-order functions, tail calls, conditionals, side
effects, exceptions, first-class continuations, and even garbage collection.

systems belonging to five early-type galaxies covering a range of mass and
environment. Photometric data were obtained with the Gemini North and Gemini
South telescopes in the filter passbands g', r', and i'. The combination of
these filters with good seeing conditions allows an excellent separation
between GC candidates and unresolved field objects. Bimodal GC colour
distributions are found in all five galaxies. Most of the GC systems appear
bimodal even in the (g' -r') vs (r' -i') plane. A population of
resolved/marginally resolved GC and Ultra Compact Dwarf candidates was found in
all the galaxies. A search for the so-called ""blue tilt"" in the
colour-magnitude diagrams reveals that NGC 4649 clearly shows that phenomenon
although no conclusive evidence was found for the other galaxies in the sample.
This ""blue tilt"" translates into a mass-metallicity relation given by Z \propto
M^0.28\pm0.03 . This dependence was found using a new empirical (g' -i') vs
[Z/H] relation which relies on an homogeneous sample of GC colours and
metallicities. This paper also explores the radial trends in both colour and
surface density for the blue (metal-poor) and red (metal-rich) GC
subpopulations. As usual, the red GCs show a steeper radial distribution than
the blue ones. Evidence of galactocentric colour gradients is found in some of
the GC systems, being more significant for the two S0 galaxies in the sample.
Red GC subpopulations show similar colours and gradients to the galaxy halo
stars in their inner region. A GC mean colour-galaxy luminosity relation,
consistent with [Z/H] \propto L_B ^0.26\pm0.08, is present for the red GCs. An
estimate of the total GC populations and specific frequency SN values is
presented for NGC 3115, NGC 3379, NGC 3923 and NGC 4649.

radiation in the BDMPS-Z regime, that is, short formation times \tau_f << L and
relatively large emission angles \theta >>\theta_c = 2/\sqrt{\hat q L^3}, with
\hat q the `jet quenching' parameter. We demonstrate that, for a dipole opening
angle \theta_{q\bar q} larger than \theta_c, the interference between the
medium-induced gluon emissions by the quark and the antiquark is parametrically
suppressed with respect to the corresponding direct emissions. Physically, this
is so since the direct emissions can be delocalized anywhere throughout the
medium and thus yield contributions proportional to L. On the contrary, the
interference occurs only between gluons emitted at very early times, within the
characteristic time scales for quantum and color coherence between the two
emitters, which in this regime are much smaller than L. This implies that, for
\theta_{q\bar q} >> \theta_c, the medium-induced radiation by the dipole is
simply the sum of the two BDMPS-Z spectra individually produced by the quark
and the antiquark, without coherence effects like angular ordering. For
\theta_{q\bar q} << \theta_c, the BDMPS-Z radiation by the dipole vanishes.

understanding of the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions is also
applicable at even higher energies. Specifically, we employ the hybrid approach
with two different equations of state and the pure hadronic transport approach
to indicate sensitivities to finite viscosity. The centrality dependence of the
charged hadron multiplicity, $p_T$ spectra and differential elliptic flow are
shown to be in reasonable agreement with the ALICE data. Furthermore, we make
predictions for the transverse mass spectra of identified particles and
triangular flow. The eccentricities and their fluctuations are found to be
surprisingly similar to the ones at lower energies and therefore also the

puddle regimes coexists with regular metallic diffusive transport. The
existence of puddles allows the local activation at low carrier densities,
giving rise to an insulating temperature dependence in the conductivity of both

qualitative similarity and the quantitative difference between monolayer and

calculation explains the non-monotonic feature of the temperature dependent
transport, which is experimentally generically observed in low mobility
graphene samples. We establish the 2-component nature (i.e., both activated and
diffusive) of graphene transport arising from the existence of potential
fluctuation induced inhomogeneous density puddles. The temperature dependence
of the graphene conductivity arises from many competing mechanisms, even
without considering any phonon effects, such as thermal excitation of carriers
from the valence band to the conduction band, temperature dependent screening,
thermal activation across the potential fluctuations associated with the
electron-hole puddles induced by the random charged impurities in the

key process in the path towards long gamma-ray bursts. Lightcurves of the
object show variability at the 10% level on a timescale of years. Such changes
are unprecedented for classical Wolf-Rayet stars, and are more reminiscent of
Luminous Blue Variables. Finally, we discuss two possibilities for the origin
of VFTS 682: (i) the star either formed in situ, which would have profound

for their unprecedented ability to detect physical quantities such as molecular

molecular detection have been based on the principle that molecular adsorption
onto a resonator surface increases the effective mass, and consequently
decreases the resonant frequencies of the nanomechanical resonator. However,
this principle is insufficient to provide fundamental insights into

correlation lengths along the major axis of $2.5H$ and $1.5H$ respectively),
and generally consistent with that expected from homogenous incompressible
turbulence. The density field, conversely, exhibits both a longer correlation

liquids using the theory of quantum phase transitions. A central role is played
by a zero density quantum critical point which is argued to control the
properties of the dilute gas. An exact renormalization group analysis of such
quantum critical points leads to a computation of the universal properties of
the dilute Bose gas and the spinful Fermi gas near a Feshbach resonance.

quasinormal (QN) mode and Regge pole (RP) resonances of this system. First, we
simulate a perturbation in the time domain by applying a finite-difference
method, to demonstrate the ubiquity of `QN ringing'. Next, we solve the wave
equation in the frequency domain with the continued-fraction method, to compute
QN and RP spectra numerically. We then explore the geometric link between
(prograde and retrograde) null geodesic orbits on the spacetime, and the
properties of the QN/RP spectra. We develop a `geodesic expansion' method which
leads to asymptotic expressions (in inverse powers of mode number $m$) for the
spectra, the radial functions and the residues. Next, the role of the Regge
poles in scattering and absorption processes is revealed through application of
the complex angular momentum method. We elucidate the link between the Regge
poles and oscillations in the absorption cross section. Finally, we show that
Regge poles provide a neat explanation for `orbiting' oscillations seen in the

e.g., by the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes. To overcome these difficulties,
economists have introduced an interesting distinction between 'risk' and
'ambiguity' depending on the existence of a (classical Kolmogorovian)
probabilistic structure modeling these uncertainty situations. On the other
hand, evidence of everyday life suggests that 'context' plays a fundamental
role in human decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it is well known from
physics that any probabilistic structure modeling contextual interactions
between entities structurally needs a non-Kolmogorovian quantum-like framework.
In this paper we introduce the notion of 'contextual risk' with the aim of
modeling a substantial part of the situations in which usually only 'ambiguity'
is present. More precisely, we firstly introduce the essentials of an
operational formalism called 'the hidden measurement approach' in which
probability is introduced as a consequence of fluctuations in the interaction
between entities and contexts. Within the hidden measurement approach we
propose a 'sphere model' as a mathematical tool for situations in which
contextual risk occurs. We show that a probabilistic model of this kind is
necessarily non-Kolmogorovian, hence it requires either the formalism of
quantum mechanics or a generalization of it. This insight is relevant, for it
explains the presence of quantum or, better, quantum-like, structures in
economics, as suggested by some authors, and can serve to solve the
aforementioned paradoxes.

discuss the spin configuration of circular and elliptical nanodots for
different perpendicular anisotropies; we show for nanodisks that micromagnetic
simulations and analytical results agree. Increasing the perpendicular
anisotropy, the vortex core radii increase, the phase diagrams are modified and
new configurations appear; the knowledge of these phase diagrams is relevant

economics literature. Situations in which contextual risk occurs cannot be
modeled by Kolmogorovian classical probabilistic structures, but a
non-Kolmogorovian framework with a quantum-like structure is needed. We prove
in this paper that the contextual risk approach can be applied to the Ellsberg
paradox, and elaborate a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement
formalism' which reveals that it is the overall conceptual landscape that is
responsible of the disagreement between actual human decisions and the

result points to the presence of a 'quantum conceptual layer' in human thought

is memory bandwidth (i.e.""the memory wall problem""). In this position paper, I
argue that if historical trends in computing evolution (where growth in
available capacity is exponential and reduction in its access latencies is
linear) continue as they have, then this view is wrong - in fact we ought to be
concentrating on reducing whole system memory access latencies wherever
possible, and by ""whole system"" I mean that we ought to look at how software
can be unnecessarily wasteful with memory bandwidth due to legacy design
decisions. To this end I conduct a feasibility study to determine whether we
ought to virtualise the MMU for each application process such that it has
direct access to its own MMU page tables and the memory allocated to a process
is managed exclusively by the process and not the kernel. I find under typical
conditions that nearly scale invariant performance to memory allocation size is
possible such that hundreds of megabytes of memory can be allocated, relocated,
swapped and deallocated in almost the same time as kilobytes (e.g. allocating
8Mb is 10x quicker under this experimental allocator than a conventional
allocator, and resizing a 128Kb block to 256Kb block is 4.5x faster). I find

how and to what extent the given symmetry is broken by the state.
Characterizing these is found to be surprisingly useful for addressing a very
common problem: to determine what follows from a system's dynamics (possibly
open) having that symmetry. We demonstrate and exploit the fact that the
asymmetry properties of a state can be understood in terms of
information-theoretic concepts. We show that for a pure state psi and a
symmetry group G, they are completely specified by the characteristic function
of the state, defined as chi_psi(g)=<psi|U(g)|psi> where g\in G and U is the
unitary representation of interest. Based on this observation, we study several
important problems about the interconversion of pure states under symmetric
dynamics such as determining the conditions for reversible transformations,
deterministic irreversible transformations and asymptotic transformations.

certain non-local correlations violate local realism. It is `possibilistic' in

Hardy's paradox is quite universal: in any (2,2,l) or (2,k,2) Bell scenario,
the occurence of Hardy's paradox is a necessary and sufficient condition for
possibilistic non-locality. In particular, it subsumes all ladder paradoxes.
This universality of Hardy's paradox is not true more generally: we find a new
`proof without inequalities' in the (2,3,3) scenario that can witness
non-locality even for correlations that do not display the Hardy paradox. We

L$_2$ associated with Tl in HREELS spectra indicate no strong Si-Tl bonding and
are well understood in terms of gradual filling of Si dangling bonds with
increasing $\theta$. Our calculational results further reveal that there are
several metastable atomic structures for Tl nanoclusters at RT transforming
from each other faster than 10$^{10}$ flippings per second. We thus conclude
that the highly mobile Tl atoms form self-trapped nanoclusters within FHUC at
RT with several metastable phases. The mobile and multi-phased nature of Tl
nanoclusters not only account for all the existing experimental observations
including the fuzzy scanning tunneling microscope images and a dynamical model
proposed by recent x-ray study but also provides an example of self-trapping of
atoms in a nanometer-scale region.

construct an efficient tester using poly(log|Gamma|) queries; for any other

in some Gaussian graphical models with cycles, its performance is
unsatisfactory for many others. In particular for some models LBP does not
converge, and in general when it does converge, the computed variances are
incorrect (except for cycle-free graphs for which belief propagation (BP) is
non-iterative and exact). In this paper we propose {\em feedback message
passing} (FMP), a message-passing algorithm that makes use of a special set of
vertices (called a {\em feedback vertex set} or {\em FVS}) whose removal
results in a cycle-free graph. In FMP, standard BP is employed several times on
the cycle-free subgraph excluding the FVS while a special message-passing
scheme is used for the nodes in the FVS. The computational complexity of exact
inference is $O(k^2n)$, where $k$ is the number of feedback nodes, and $n$ is
the total number of nodes. When the size of the FVS is very large, FMP is
intractable. Hence we propose {\em approximate FMP}, where a pseudo-FVS is used
instead of an FVS, and where inference in the non-cycle-free graph obtained by
removing the pseudo-FVS is carried out approximately using LBP. We show that,
when approximate FMP converges, it yields exact means and variances on the
pseudo-FVS and exact means throughout the remainder of the graph. We also
provide theoretical results on the convergence and accuracy of approximate FMP.
In particular, we prove error bounds on variance computation. Based on these
theoretical results, we design efficient algorithms to select a pseudo-FVS of
bounded size. The choice of the pseudo-FVS allows us to explicitly trade off
between efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that using a
pseudo-FVS of size no larger than $\log(n)$, this procedure converges much more
often, more quickly, and provides more accurate results than LBP on the entire
graph.

interstellar space. If so cosmic-rays and energetic photons cause ionisation in
the solid leading to the formation of H6+. This ion is not produced by
gas-phase reactions and its radiative transitions therefore provide a signature
of solid H2 in the astrophysical context. The vibrational transitions of H6+
are yet to be observed in the laboratory, but we have characterised them in a
quantum-theoretical treatment of the molecule; our calculations include
anharmonic corrections, which are large. Here we report on those calculations
and compare our results with astronomical data. In addition to the H6+
isotopomer, we focus on the deuterated species (HD)3+ which is expected to
dominate at low ionisation rates as a result of isotopic condensation
reactions. We can reliably predict the frequencies of the fundamental bands for
five modes of vibration. For (HD)3+ all of these are found to lie close to some
of the strongest of the pervasive mid-infrared astronomical emission bands,
making it difficult to exclude hydrogen precipitates on observational grounds.
By the same token these results suggest that (HD)3+ could be the carrier of the
observed bands. We consider this possibility within the broader picture of ISM
photo-processes and we conclude that solid hydrogen may indeed be abundant in
astrophysical environments.

crucial role in their ability to mimick the effects of the cosmological
constant. So far attention has been focused on $C^{1}$ models while in this
paper we approach it a more general way, investigating the implications of
higher order central smoothness conditions for LTB models reproducing the
luminosity distance of a $\Lambda CDM$ Universe. Our analysis is based on a low
red-shift expansion, and extends previous investigations by including also the
constraint coming from the age of the Universe and re-expressing the equations
for the solution of the inversion problem in a manifestly dimensionless form
which makes evident the freedom to accommodate any value of $H_0$ as well,
correcting some wrong claims that the observed value of $H_0$ would be enough
to rule out LTB models.
  Higher order smoothness conditions strongly limit the number of possible
solutions respect to the first order condition. Neither a $C^{1}$ or a $C^{i}$
LTB model can both satisfy the age constraint and mimick the cosmological
constant for the luminosity distance. One difference is in the case in which
the age constraint is not included and the bang function is zero, in which
there is a unique solution for $C^1$ models but no solution for the $C^{i}$
case. Another difference is in the case in which the age constraint is not
included and the bang function is not zero, in which the solution is
undetermined for both $C^1$ and $C^{i}$ models, but the latter ones have much
less residual parametric freedom.
  Our results imply that any LTB model able to fit luminosity distance data and
satisfy the age constraint is either not mimicking exactly the $\Lambda CDM$
red-shift space observables theoretical predictions or it is not $C^{\infty}$
smooth.

Recently, the critical point theory under the non regular constraint is a
concerned focus in optimization theory. The principle also suits the case of
regular constraint. Coordinately, the generalized regular constraint is
introduced, and the critical point principle on generalized regular constraint
is established. Let $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a nonlinear functional.
While the Lagrange multiplier $L$ in classical critical point principle is
considered, and its expression is given by using generalized inverse
${g'}^+(x)$ of $g'(x)$ as follows : if $x\in S$ is a critical point of $f|_S,$
then $L=f'(x)\circ {g'}^+(x) \in F^*.$ Moreover, it is proved that if $S$ is a
regular constraint, then the Lagrange multiplier $L$ is unique; otherwise, $L$
is ill-posed. Hence, in case of the non regular constraint, it is very
difficult to solve Euler equations, however, it is often the case in
optimization theory. So the principle here seems to be new and applicable. By
the way, the following theorem is proved; if $A\in B(E,F)$ is double split,
then the set of all generalized inverses of $A,$ $GI(A)$ is smooth
diffeomorphic to certain Banach space. This is a new and interesting result in
generalized inverse analysis.

the background, and potentially many other effects which are poorly understood.
Observables such as the distance-redshift relation when averaged on the sky do
not necessarily yield the same smooth model which arises when performing
spatial averages. These issues are thought to be of technical interest only in
the standard model of cosmology, giving only tiny corrections. However, when we
try to calculate observable quantities such as the all-sky average of the
distance-redshift relation, we find that perturbation theory delivers divergent
answers in the UV and corrections to the background of order unity. There are
further problems. Second-order perturbations are the same size as first-order,
and fourth-order at least the same as second, and possibly much larger, owing
to the divergences. Much hinges on a coincidental balance of 2 numbers: the
primordial power, and the ratio between the comoving Hubble scales at
matter-radiation equality and today. Consequently, it is far from obvious that
backreaction is irrelevant even in the concordance model, however natural it
intuitively seems.

of particle acceleration and impulsive energy release in magnetized plasmas
that occur throughout the universe, from planetary magnetospheres to black hole
accretion disks. Solar flares are the most powerful explosions in the solar
system, releasing up to 10^32-10^33 ergs over only 100-1,000 seconds,
accelerating electrons up to hundreds of MeV and heating plasma to tens of MK.
The accelerated electrons and the hot plasma each contain tens of percent of
the total flare energy, indicating an intimate link between particle
acceleration, plasma heating, and flare energy release. The Reuven Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) observes the X-ray emission from
these processes from ~3 keV to ~17 MeV with unprecedented spectral, spatial,
and temporal resolution. RHESSI observations show that ""super-hot"" (>30 MK)
plasma temperatures are achieved almost exclusively by intense, GOES X-class
flares and appear to be strictly associated with coronal magnetic field
strengths exceeding ~170 Gauss, suggesting a direct link between the magnetic
field and heating of super-hot plasma. Images and spectra of the 2002 July 23
X4.8 event reveal that the super-hot plasma is both spectrally and spatially
distinct from the commonly-observed ~10-20 MK plasma, and is located above the
cooler source. It exists with high density even during the pre-impulsive phase,
which is dominated by coronal non-thermal emission with negligible footpoints,
suggesting that, rather than the traditional picture of chromospheric
evaporation, the origins of super-hot plasma may be the compression and
subsequent thermalization of ambient material accelerated in the reconnection
region above the flare loop, a physically-plausible process not detectable with
current instruments but potentially observable with future telescopes.

the cross-sectional evolution of a twisted magnetic flux tube rising from the
deeper solar convection zone (-20,000 km) to the corona through the surface.
The initial depth is ten times deeper than most of previous calculations
focusing on the flux emergence from the uppermost convection zone. We find that
the evolution is illustrated by the two-step process described below: the
initial tube rises due to its buoyancy, subject to aerodynamic drag due to the
external flow. Because of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field, the
tube maintains its coherency and does not deform to become a vortex roll pair.
When the flux tube approaches the photosphere and expands sufficiently, the
plasma on the rising tube accumulates to suppress the tube's emergence.
Therefore, the flux decelerates and extends horizontally beneath the surface.
This new finding owes to our large scale simulation calculating simultaneously
the dynamics within the interior as well as above the surface. As the magnetic
pressure gradient increases around the surface, magnetic buoyancy instability
is triggered locally and, as a result, the flux rises further into the solar
corona. We also find that the deceleration occurs at a higher altitude than in
our previous experiment using magnetic flux sheets (Toriumi and Yokoyama). By
conducting parametric studies, we investigate the conditions for the two-step
emergence of the rising flux tube: field strength > 1.5x10^4 G and the twist >
5.0x10^-4 km^-1 at -20,000 km depth.

directions is zero. We show how, by a proper choice of the expansion
coefficients, this ideal can be best approximated. We present a design for a
practical electrode geometry based on this analysis. By bending such a
deflection field into a circle, a simple storage ring can be created; the
direct analog of a weak-focusing cyclotron for charged particles. We show that
for realistic parameters a weak-focusing ring is only stable for molecules with
a very low velocity. A strong-focusing (alternating-gradient) storage ring can
be created by arranging many straight deflection fields in a circle and by
alternating the sign of the hexapole term between adjacent deflection fields.
The acceptance of this ring is numerically calculated for realistic parameters.
Such a storage might prove useful in experiments looking for an EDM of
elementary particles.

Surprisingly, they also boost the citation rates of their previous

how new ideas and new players can make their way and finally triumph in a world
dominated by established paradigms. The underlying ""boost factor"" is also
useful to discover scientific breakthroughs and talents much earlier than
through classical citation analysis, which by now has become a widespread
method to measure scientific excellence, influencing scientific careers and the
distribution of research funds. Our findings reveal patterns of collective
social behavior, which are also interesting from an attention economics

convexity or concavity constraints on the response function. Convexity
constraints are common in economics, statistics, operations research, financial

that is computationally feasible for more than a few hundred observations. We
introduce Convex Adaptive Partitioning (CAP), which creates a globally convex
regression model from locally linear estimates fit on adaptively selected
covariate partitions. CAP is computationally efficient, in stark contrast to
current methods. The most popular method, the least squares estimator, has a
computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. We show that CAP has a
computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \log(n)\log(\log(n)))$ and also give
consistency results. CAP is applied to value function approximation for pricing

features of the corresponding general renormalizable doublet/triplet Higgs
potential that depends on five dimensionless couplings and two mass parameters
after spontaneous symmetry breaking, and highlight the implications for the
Higgs phenomenology. In particular, we determine i) the complete set of
tree-level unitarity constraints on the couplings of the potential and ii) the
exact tree-level {\sl all directions} boundedness from below constraints on
these couplings. When combined, these constraints delineate precisely the
theoretically allowed parameter space domain within our perturbative
approximation. Among the seven physical Higgs states of this model, the mass of
the lighter (heavier) CP-even state h0 (H0) will always satisfy a theoretical
upper (lower) bound that is reached for a critical value mu_c of mu (the mass
parameter controlling triple couplings among the doublet/triplet Higgses).
Saturating the unitarity bounds we find m_h0 < {\cal O}(0.7 - 1 TeV), while the
upper bound for the remaining Higgses lies in the several tens of TeV. However,
the actual masses can be much lighter. We identify two regimes corresponding to
mu > mu_c and mu < mu_c. In the first regime the Higgs sector is typically very
heavy and only h0 that becomes SM-like could be accessible to the LHC. In
contrast, in the second regime, somewhat overlooked in the literature, most of
the Higgs sector is light. In particular the heaviest state H0 becomes SM-like,
the lighter states being the CP-odd Higgs, the (doubly) charged Higgses and a
decoupled h0, possibly leading to a distinctive phenomenology at the colliders.

concentrations c_0 and are filtered to remove traces of undissolved PEO
clusters. In typical experiments, droplets with initial volumes between 5\muL

monitored. Droplets either form a disk-like solid ""puddle"" or a tall conical
""pillar"". The droplet mass is monitored using a microbalance and the droplet
profile is recorded regularly using a digital camera. Subsequent processing of
the data allows values of droplet volume V, surface area A, base radius R,
contact angle {\theta} and height h to be determined throughout drying. From
this data we identify four stages during pillar formation: pinned drying;
pseudo-dewetting; bootstrap building; solid contraction and propose physical
models to explain key aspects of each stage and to predict the transition from
each stage to the next. The experimental parameters of relative humidity,
temperature, pressure, droplet volume and initial contact angle are all
systematically varied and observed to influence the drying process and
consequently whether the droplet forms a pillar or a puddle. We combine these

simulation of a globular cluster with a tidal tail where we successfully
recover the tails for a cluster at the same position and with the same
characteristics of NGC 2298. Based on the simulation we estimate that the
matched-filter increases the contrast of the tail relative to the background of
stars by a factor of 2.5 for the case of NGC 2298. We also present the
photometry of the globular cluster NGC 2298 using the MOSAIC2 camera installed
on the CTIO 4m telescope. The photometry covers ~ 3deg2 reaching V ~ 23. A fit
of a King profile to the radial density profile of NGC 2298 shows that this
cluster has a tidal radius of 15.91' \pm 1.07' which is twice as in the
literature. The application of the matched-filter to NGC 2298 reveals several
extra-tidal structures, including a leading and trailing tail. We also find
that NGC 2298 has extra-tidal structures stretching towards and against the
Galactic disk, suggesting strong tidal interaction. Finally, we assess how the
matched-filter performs when applied to a globular cluster with and without
mass segregation taken into account. We find that disregarding the effects of
mass segregation may significantly reduce the detection limit of the
matched-filter.

this effect is increased for cosmologically distant objects; because of severe
energy losses, UHE protons cannot achieve us even in the case of extremely weak

conversion from protons to secondary particles becomes significantly more
effective due to the denser and more energetic CMB in the past. This increases
the chances of UHE cosmic rays to be traced by the secondary synchrotron gamma

reminiscent of the ordering of block copolymers in cylindrical confinement.
Starting from this analogy, Leibler's theory of microphase separation in block
copolymer melts is generalized to derive a description of the system in the
weak segregation limit. Also molecular dynamics simulation results of a
corresponding coarse-grained bead-spring model are presented. Using side chain
lengths up to N = 50 effective monomers, the ratio of the Lennard-Jones energy
parameter between unlike monomers $(\epsilon_{AB})$ and monomers of the same

functions are analyzed to study the conditions when (local) Janus cylinder-type
ordering and when (local) microphase separation in the direction along the
cylinder axis occurs. Both the analytical theory and the simulations give
evidence for short range order due to a tendency towards microphase separation
in the axial direction, with a wavelength proportional to the side chain
gyration radius, irrespective of temperature and grafting density, for a wide
range of these parameters.

previous studies, we find that hierarchical cluster formation occurs chiefly as
a result of scattering of stars out of clumps, and not through clump merging.
Two-body relaxation, in particular within the body of a clump, can
significantly increase the rate at which substructure is erased beyond that of
clump-merging alone. Hence the relaxation time of individual clumps is a key
parameter controlling the rate at which smooth, spherical star clusters can
form. The initial virial ratio of the clumps is an additional key parameter
controlling the formation rate of a cluster. Reducing the initial virial ratio
causes a star cluster to lose its substructure more rapidly.

constant, high spatial resolution, we aim at updating results of earlier
ground-based studies of contrast vs. magnetogram signal, and to look for
systematic differences between AR plages and QS network. The field strength,
filling factor and inclination of the field was retrieved by Milne-Eddington
inversion (VFISV). As in earlier studies, we performed a pixel-by-pixel study
of 630.2 nm continuum contrast vs. apparent (i.e. averaged over a pixel)
longitudinal magnetic field over large fields of view in ARs and in the QS. The
contrast of magnetic elements reaches larger values in the QS (on average 3.7%)
than in ARs (1.3%). This could not be attributed to any systematic difference
in the chosen contrast references. At Hinode's spatial resolution, the
relationship between contrast and apparent longitudinal field strength exhibits
a peak at around 700 G in both the QS and ARs, whereas earlier lower resolution
studies only found a peak in the QS and a monotonous decrease in ARs. We
attribute this discrepancy both to our careful removal of the pores and their
close surroundings affected by the telescope diffraction, as well as to the
enhanced spatial resolution and very low scattered light of the Hinode Solar

which is rather low compared to the high merger rate of galaxies. Here we
construct a phenomenological model to estimate the number density of dual AGNs
and its evolution according to the observationally-estimated major merger rates
of galaxies and various scaling relations on the properties of galaxies and
their central massive black holes. We show that our model reproduces the
observed frequency and separation distribution of dual AGNs provided that
significant nuclear activities are triggered only in gas-rich progenitor
galaxies with central massive black holes and only when the nuclei of these
galaxies are roughly within the half-light radii of their companion galaxies.
Under these constraints, the observed low dual AGN frequency is consistent with
the relatively high merger rate of galaxies and supports the hypothesis that
major mergers lead to AGN/QSO activities. We also predict that the number of
kpc-scale dual AGNs decreases with increasing redshift and only about
0.02%--0.06% of AGNs are dual AGNs with double-peaked narrow line features at
redshifts of z 0.5-1.2. Future observations of high-redshift dual AGNs would

We then add four-fermion contact interactions to the lagrangian and show that

Performing an expansion in inverse powers of the speed of light, we obtain the
post-Newtonian equations, which yield the lowest-order relativistic effects
arising during the non-linear evolution. We then specialize our analysis to
globally plane-parallel configurations, i.e. to the case where the initial
perturbation field depends on a single coordinate. The leading order of our
expansion, corresponding to the ""Newtonian background"", is the Zel'dovich
approximation, which, for plane-parallel perturbations in the Newtonian limit,
represents an exact solution. This allows us to find the exact analytical form
for the post-Newtonian metric, thereby providing the post-Newtonian extension
of the Zel'dovich solution: this accounts for some relativistic effects, such
as the non-Gaussianity of primordial perturbations. An application of our
solution in the context of the back-reaction proposal is eventually given,

changes in the topology or complexity of an active region's magnetic field.
Here, the evolution of the magnetic field in active region NOAA 10953 was
examined using Hinode/SOT-SP data, over a period of 12 hours leading up to and
after a GOES B1.0 flare. A number of magnetic-field properties and low-order
aspects of magnetic-field topology were extracted from two flux regions that
exhibited increased Ca II H emission during the flare. Pre-flare increases in
vertical field strength, vertical current density, and inclination angle of ~
8degrees towards the vertical were observed in flux elements surrounding the
primary sunspot. The vertical field strength and current density subsequently
decreased in the post-flare state, with the inclination becoming more
horizontal by ~7degrees. This behaviour of the field vector may provide a
physical basis for future flare forecasting efforts.

C*-algebras if and only if it has trivial shape, that is, if it is shape
equivalent to the zero C*-algebra. In particular, every contractible C*-algebra
is an inductive limit of projectives, and one may assume that the connecting
morphisms are surjective. Interestingly, an example of Dadarlat shows that
trivial shape does not pass to full hereditary sub-C*-algebra. It then follows
that the same fails for projectivity.

decompositions, and we discuss the relation with different concepts of
approximation.
  As a main application of our findings we show that a C*-algebra is (weakly)
projective if and only if it is (weakly) semiprojective and has trivial shape.
It follows that a \ca{} is projective if and only if it is contractible and
semiprojective. This confirms a conjecture of Loring.

problematic issues, and describe some techniques which either seem to help with
the difficulties or at least investigate their scope.
  The definition of black holes via event horizons has been problematic because
it depends on knowing the global structure of space-time; often attempts to
avoid this (e.g. apparent horizons) require knowledge of the interior geometry.
I suggest studying instead the holonomy relating the exterior neighborhood of
the incipient horizon to the regime of distant observers; at least in the
spherically symmetric case, this holonomy will develop certain universal
features, in principle observable from signals emitted from infalling objects.
  I discuss the theory of quantum fields in curved space-time, and the
difficulties with Hawking's prediction of black-hole radiation. I then show
that the usual, very natural, theory of quantum fields in curved space-time
runs into difficulties when applied to measurement problems, interactions,
zero-point effects and stress-energies. I suggest that we take seriously the
possibility that this theory, for all its naturalness, may not be quite right.

(PCP) violating interaction in varying alpha theory. Due to this interaction,
the state of photon polarization can change when it passes through a strong
background magnetic field. We have calculated the optical rotation and
ellipticity of the plane of polarization of an electromagnetic wave and tested
our results against different laboratory experiments. Our model contains a PCP
violating parameter $\beta$ and a scale of alpha variation $\omega$. By
analyzing the laboratory experimental data, we found the most stringent
constraints on our model parameters to be $1\leq \omega \leq 10^{13} GeV^2$ and
$-0.5\leq \beta \leq 0.5$. We also found that with the existing experimental
input parameters it is very difficult to detect the ellipticity in the near
future.

computing service precisely when needed. However, certain factors such as
security of data and regulatory issues will impact a user's choice of using
such a service. A solution to these problems is the use of a hybrid cloud that
combines a user's local computing capabilities (for mission- or
organization-critical tasks) with a public cloud (for less influential tasks).
We foresee three challenges that must be overcome before the adoption of a
hybrid cloud approach: 1) data design: How to partition relations in a hybrid
cloud? The solution to this problem must account for the sensitivity of
attributes in a relation as well as the workload of a user; 2) data security:
How to protect a user's data in a public cloud with encryption while enabling
query processing over this encrypted data? and 3) query processing: How to
execute queries efficiently over both, encrypted and unencrypted data? This
paper addresses these challenges and incorporates their solutions into an
add-on tool for a Hadoop and Hive based cloud computing infrastructure.

narrow bandwidth is studied within the framework of the local moment approach.
The resultant single-particle spectra are compared to unrestricted
Hartree-Fock, second order perturbation theory about the noninteracting limit,
and Lanczos spectra by Hofstetter and Kehrein. Rather accurate analytical
results explain the spectral evolution over almost the entire range of
interactions. These encompass, in particular, a rationale for the four-peak
structure observed in the low-energy sector of the Lanczos spectra in the
moderate-coupling regime. In weak coupling, the spectral evolution is governed
by orbital effects, while in the strong coupling Kondo limit, the model is
shown to connect smoothly to the generic Anderson impurity with a flat and
infinitely wide hybridization band.

more than one outburst during the RXTE era. XTE J1751-305 showed, after the
main outburst in 2002, other three dim outbursts. We report on the timing
analysis of the latest one, occurred on October 8, 2009 and serendipitously
observed from its very beginning by RXTE. Aims. The detection of the pulsation
during more than one outburst permits to obtain a better constraint of the
orbital parameters and their evolution as well as to track the secular spin
frequency evolution of the source. Methods. Using the RXTE data of the last
outburst of the AMP XTE J1751-305, we performed a timing analysis to improve
the orbital parameters. Because of the low statistics, we used an epoch folding
search technique on the whole data set to improve the local estimate of the
time of ascending node passage. Results. Using this new orbital solution we
epoch folded data obtaining three pulse phase delays on a time span of 1.2
days, that we fitted using a constant spin frequency model. Comparing this
barycentric spin frequency with that of the 2002 outburst, we obtained a
secular spin frequency derivative of -0.55(12) x 10^{-14} Hz s^{-1}. In the
hypothesis that the secular spin-down is due to a rotating magneto-dipole
emission, consistently with what is assumed for radio pulsars, we estimate the
pulsar's magnetic dipole value. We derive an estimate of the magnetic field
strength at the polar cap of B_{PC} = 4.0(4) x 10^8 Gauss, for a neutron star
mass of 1.4M\odot, assuming the Friedman Pandharipande Skyrme equation of
state.

relativistic wave equation that accounts for the propagation of light from a
source to an observer in two different inertial frames. This equation, which is
based on the primacy of the Doppler effect, can account for the relativity of
simultaneity and the observation that charged particles cannot exceed the speed
of light. In contrast to the Special Theory of Relativity, it does so without
the necessity of introducing the relativity of space and time. Here we show
that the new relativistic wave equation based on the primacy of the Doppler
effect is quantitatively more accurate than the standard theory based on the
Fresnel drag coefficient or the relativity of space and time in accounting for
the results of Fizeau's experiment on the optics of moving media - the very
experiment that Einstein considered to be ""a crucial test in favour of the
theory of relativity."" The new relativistic wave equation quantitatively
describes other observations involving the optics of moving bodies, including
stellar aberration and the null results of the Michelson-Morley experiment. In
this paper, we propose an experiment to test the influence of the refractive
index on the interference fringe shift generated by moving media. The Special
Theory of Relativity, which is based on the relativity of space and time, and
the new relativistic wave equation, which is based on the primacy of the
Doppler effect, make different predictions concerning the influence of the
refractive index on the optics of moving media.
