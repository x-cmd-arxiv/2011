present-day mass from about 1E4 to 2E5 solar masses. We compare radial
distributions of stars in the upper and lower parts of the MSTO region, and
calculate cluster masses and escape velocities from the present time back to a
cluster age of 10 Myr. Our main result is that for all clusters in our sample
with estimated escape velocities > 15 km/s at an age of 10 Myr, the stars in
the brightest half of the MSTO region are significantly more centrally
concentrated than the stars in the faintest half AND more massive red giant
branch and asymptotic giant branch stars. This is not the case for clusters
with escape velocities < 10 km/s at an age of 10 Myr. We argue that the wide
MSTO region of such clusters is mainly caused by to a 200 - 500 Myr range in
the ages of cluster stars due to extended star formation within the cluster
from material shed by first-generation stars featuring slow stellar winds.
Dilution of this enriched material by accretion of ambient interstellar matter
is deemed plausible if the spread of [Fe/H] in this ambient gas was very small
when the second-generation stars were formed in the cluster.

1.2-mm dust clumps presented in the literature. We combine our new observations
with previous water maser observations to extend our sample to 294 1.2-mm dust
clumps, towards which we detect 165 distinct water maser sites towards 128
1.2-mm dust clumps. Within the fields of our observations, we additionally find
four water masers with no apparent associated 1.2-mm dust continuum emission.
Our overall detection rate of 44 per cent appears to vary as a function of
Galactic longitude. We find that there is an excellent correspondence between
the locations of the detected water masers with the peak of the target 1.2-mm
dust clump sources. As expected from previous similar studies, the water masers
are chiefly detected towards the bigger, brighter and more massive 1.2-mm dust
clumps. We find further evidence that the water masers tend to increase in flux
density (and therefore luminosity), as well as velocity range, as the sources
evolve. We also show that the current sample of water maser sources suffer less
from evolutionary biases than previous targeted searches. A higher fraction of
dust clump sources in our sample are only associated with water masers (41)
than only associated with methanol masers (13). This suggests that water masers
can be present at an even earlier evolutionary stage than 6.7-GHz methanol
masers. Comparison of the water maser detection rates associated with different
combinations of methanol maser and radio continuum, as well as those with
neither tracer, shows that the highest detection rate is towards those sources
which also exhibit methanol maser emission. We have tested a previously
hypothesised model for water maser presence towards 1.2-mm dust clumps. We
suggest refinements and future work which will further constrain the nature of
the driving sources associated with water masers.

different classical dimer configurations, have attracted a great deal of
interest as a paradigm for the study of exotic quantum phases. Much of this
excitement has centred on the claim that a certain class of quantum dimer
model, defined on a bipartite lattice, can support a quantum U(1)-liquid phase
with deconfined fractional excitations in three dimensions. These fractional
monomer excitations are quantum analogues of the magnetic monopoles found in
spin ice. In this article we use extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations to
establish the ground-state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on the
three-dimensional, bipartite, diamond lattice as a function of the ratio {\mu}
of the potential to kinetic energy terms in the Hamiltonian. We find that, for
{\mu}_c = 0.75 +/- 0.04, the model undergoes a first-order quantum phase
transition from an ordered ""R-state"" into an extended quantum U(1)-liquid
phase, which terminates in a quantum critical ""RK point"" for {\mu}=1. This
confirms the published field-theoretical scenario. We present detailed evidence
for the existence of the U(1)-liquid phase, and indirect evidence for the
existence of its photon and monopole excitations. We also explore some of the
technical ramifications of this analysis, benchmarking quantum Monte Carlo
against a variety of exact and perturbative results, comparing different
variational wave functions. The ergodicity of the quantum dimer model on a
diamond lattice is discussed in detail. These results complete and extend the
analysis previously published in [O. Sikora et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103,

halo produced by the scattering of the point source X-ray radiation by dust
along the line of sight, and we show that the source X-ray spectrum is well
described by an absorbed blackbody, with temperature kT=1.2 keV and absorbing
column nH=(10.4+/-0.2)E22 cm^-2, while different or more complex models are
disfavoured. The source persistent X-ray emission remained fairly constant at
about 3.7E-12 erg/cm^2/s for the first 20 days after the onset of the bursting

Fourier analysis and spectral graph theory to show that one can reduce testing
odd-cycle-freeness of Boolean functions to testing bipartiteness of dense

connections between testability of properties of Boolean functions and of graph

algorithm operates by picking a random linear subspace of dimension O(log

odd-cycle-free or not. The test is analyzed by studying the effect of random
subspace restriction on the Fourier coefficients of a function. Our work
implies that testing odd-cycle-freeness using a canonical tester instead of an
arbitrary tester incurs no more than a polynomial blowup in the query
complexity. The question of whether a canonical tester with polynomial blowup

of a solar influence. Analyses of datasets acquired at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory (BNL) and at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) both
show evidence of an annual periodicity and of periodicities with sidereal
frequencies in the neighborhood of 12.25 year^{-1} (at a significance level
that we have estimated to be 10^{-17}). It is notable that this implied
rotation rate is lower than that attributed to the solar radiative zone,
suggestive of a slowly rotating solar core. This leads us to hypothesize that
there may be an ""inner tachocline"" separating the core from the radiative zone,
analogous to the ""outer tachocline"" that separates the radiative zone from the
convection zone. The Rieger periodicity (which has a period of about 154 days,
corresponding to a frequency of 2.37 year^{-1}) may be attributed to an r-mode
oscillation with spherical-harmonic indices l=3, m=1, located in the outer
tachocline. This suggests that we may test the hypothesis of a solar influence
on nuclear decay rates by searching BNL and PTB data for evidence of a
""Rieger-like"" r-mode oscillation, with l=3, m=1, in the inner tachocline. The
appropriate search band for such an oscillation is estimated to be 2.00-2.28
year^{-1}. We find, in both datasets, strong evidence of a periodicity at 2.11
year^{-1}. We estimate that the probability of obtaining these results by
chance is 10^{-12}.

any one set of isochrones. The cluster CMDs show several interesting features,
including extended main sequence turnoff (MSTO) regions, narrow red giant

extended MSTOs are not caused by photometric uncertainties, contamination by
field stars, or the presence of binary stars. Enhanced helium abundances in a
fraction of cluster stars are also ruled out as the reason for the extended
MSTOs. Quantitative comparisons with simulations indicate that the MSTO regions
are better described by a spread in ages than by a bimodal age distribution,
although we can not formally rule out the latter for the three lowest-mass
clusters in our sample (which have masses lower than about 3E4 solar masses).
This conclusion differs from that of some previous works which suggested that
the age distribution in massive clusters in our sample is bimodal. This
suggests that any secondary star formation occurred in an extended fashion
rather than through short bursts. We discuss these results in the context of
the nature of multiple stellar populations in star clusters.

the electron-momentum distributions exhibit interference maxima and minima due
to the electron emission at spatially separated centers. We provide generalized
analytical expressions for such maxima or minima, which take into account $s$
$p$ mixing and the orbital geometry. The patterns caused by the two-center
interference are sharpest for vanishing alignment angle and get washed out as
this parameter increases. Apart from that, there exist features due to the
geometry of the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which may be observed
for a wide range of alignment angles. Such features manifest themselves as the
suppression of probability density in specific momentum regions due to the
shape of the LUMO wavefunction, or as an overall decrease in the RESI yield due
to the presence of nodal planes.

from the convolution of these equations with the interpolating kernel. The two
most important aspects of the numerical implementation of these equations are
(a) the appearance of fluid velocity and pressure obtained from the solution of
the Riemann problem between each pair of particles, and (b the absence of an
artificial viscosity term. We carry out three different controlled
hydrodynamical three-dimensional tests, namely the Sod shock tube, the
development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in a shear flow test, and the
""blob"" test describing the evolution of a cold cloud moving against a hot wind.
  The results of our tests confirm and extend in a number of aspects those
recently obtained by Cha (2010): (i) GSPH provides a much improved description
of contact discontinuities, with respect to SPH, thus avoiding the appearance
of spurious pressure forces; (ii) GSPH is able to follow the development of
gas-dynamical instabilities, such as the Kevin--Helmholtz and the
Rayleigh-Taylor ones; (iii) as a result, GSPH describes the development of curl
structures in the shear-flow test and the dissolution of the cold cloud in the
""blob"" test.
  We also discuss in detail the effect on the performances of GSPH of changing
different aspects of its implementation. The results of our tests demonstrate
that GSPH is in fact a highly promising hydrodynamic scheme, also to be coupled
to an N-body solver, for astrophysical and cosmological applications.

one-dimensional power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass model, in which the rms
strength of the interactions decays with distance, r as 1/r^{sigma}. It is
argued that varying the power sigma is analogous to varying the space dimension
d in a short-range model. For sigma=0.6, which is in the mean field regime
regime, we find clear evidence for an AT line. For sigma = 0.85, which is in
the non-mean-field regime and corresponds to a space dimension of close to 3,
we find no AT line, though we cannot rule one out for very small fields.
Finally for sigma=0.75, which is in the non-mean-field regime but closer to the
mean-field boundary, the evidence suggests that there is an AT line, though the
possibility that even larger sizes are needed to see the asymptotic behavior
can not be ruled out.

to be exactly solvable in terms of non-classical Romanovski polynomials. The
energies of such a system are linear combinations of t(t+1) and 1/[t(t+1)+1/4]
terms with the non-negative integer principal quantum number t=n+|/bar{m}|
being the sum of the degree n of the polynomials and the absolute value,
|/bar{m}|, of the square root of the separation constant between the polar and
azimuthal motions. The latter obeys, with respect to t, the same branching
rule, |/bar{m}|=0,1,..., t, as does the magnetic quantum number with respect to
the angular momentum, l, and, in this fashion, the t quantum number presents
itself indistinguishable from l. In effect, the spectrum of the hindered
rotator has the same (2t+1)-fold level multiplicity as the unperturbed one. For
small t values, the wave functions and excitation energies of the perturbed
rotator differ from the ordinary spherical harmonics, and the l(l+1) law,
respectively, while approaching them asymptotically with increasing t. In this
fashion the breaking of the rotational symmetry at the level of the
representation functions is opaqued by the level degeneracy. The model provides
a tool for the description of rotational bands with anomalously large gaps
between the ground state and its first excitation.

the exponential tail of the shock on the supersonic side shrinks as

by also accounting for the cost of observations used before the change point.
The observation cost is captured through the average number of observations
used in the detection process before the change occurs. The objective is to
select an on-off observation control policy, that decides whether or not to
take a given observation, along with the stopping time at which the change is
declared, so as to minimize the average detection delay, subject to constraints
on both the probability of false alarm and the observation cost. By considering
a Lagrangian relaxation of the constraint problem, and using dynamic
programming arguments, we obtain an \textit{a posteriori} probability based
two-threshold algorithm that is a generalized version of the classical Shiryaev
algorithm. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the two-threshold algorithm and
show that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal, i.e., the performance of the
two-threshold algorithm approaches that of the Shiryaev algorithm, for a fixed
observation cost, as the probability of false alarm goes to zero. We also show,
using simulations, that the two-threshold algorithm has good observation
cost-delay trade-off curves, and provides significant reduction in observation
cost as compared to the naive approach of fractional sampling, where samples
are skipped randomly. Our analysis reveals that, for practical choices of
constraints, the two thresholds can be set independent of each other: one based
on the constraint of false alarm and another based on the observation cost
constraint alone.

service times) can be generally distributed. In this paper, we establish heavy
traffic limit theorems to provide suitable approximations for the system under
first-in first-out (FIFO) and work conserving service discipline, which state
that, when the lengths of both ON- and OFF-periods are lightly tailed, the
sequences of the scaled queue length and workload processes converge weakly to
short-range dependent reflecting Gaussian processes, and when the lengths of
ON- and/or OFF periods are heavily tailed with infinite variance, the sequences
converge weakly to either reflecting fractional Brownian motions (FBMs) or
certain type of long-range dependent reflecting Gaussian processes depending on
the choice of scaling as the number of superposed sources tends to infinity.
Moreover, the sequences exhibit a state space collapse-like property when the
number of sources is large enough, which is a kind of extension of the
well-known Little's law for M/M/1 queueing system. Theory to justify the
approximations is based on appropriate heavy traffic conditions which
essentially mean that the service rate closely approaches the arrival rate when
the number of input sources tends to infinity.

of radius $ R $ by a distance $ \eta $ [E. Cerda, S. Chaieb, F. Melo, and L.
Mahadevan, {\sl Nature} {\bf 401}, 46 (1999)]. The mean curvature was reported
to vanish at the rim where the d-cone is supported [T. Liang and T. A. Witten,

two principal curvatures versus sheet thickness $h$ over a wider dynamic range
than was used previously, holding $ R $ and $ \eta $ fixed. Instead of tending
towards 1 as suggested by previous work, the ratio scales as $(h/R)^{1/3}$.
Thus the mean curvature does not vanish for very thin sheets as previously
claimed. Moreover, we find that the normalized rim profile of radial curvature
in a d-cone is identical to that in a ""c-cone"" which is made by pushing a
regular cone into a circular container. In both c-cones and d-cones, the ratio
of the principal curvatures at the rim scales as $ (R/h)^{5/2}F/(YR^{2}) $,
where $ F $ is the pushing force and $ Y $ is the Young's modulus. Scaling
arguments and analytical solutions confirm the numerical results.

electromagnetic interactions is introduced. The zero and low temperature
properties of the model are studied using rigorous renormalization group
methods and lattice Ward identities. In particular, it is shown that, at all
orders in renormalized perturbation theory, the Schwinger functions and the
response functions decay with interaction dependent anomalous exponents.
Regarding the 2-point Schwinger function, the wave function renormalization
diverges in the infrared limit, while the effective Fermi velocity flows to the
speed of light. Concerning the response functions, those associated to a
Kekul\'e distortion of the honeycomb lattice and to a charge density wave
instability are enhanced by the electromagnetic electron-electron interactions
(their scaling in real space is depressed), while the lowest order correction
to the scaling exponent of the density-density response function is vanishing.
Then, the model in presence of a fixed Kekul\'e distortion is studied, and it
is shown that the interaction strongly renormalizes the effective amplitude of
the lattice distortion. Finally, the effect of the electronic repulsion on the
Peierls-Kekul\'e instability is discussed by deriving a non-BCS gap equation,
from which we find evidence that strong electromagnetic interactions facilitate
the spontaneous distortion of the lattice and the opening of a gap. This thesis
is based on joint work with A. Giuliani and V. Mastropietro.

powerful methods for studying 2D systems with a sign problem. Reviewing past
applications of DMRG in 2D demonstrates its success in treating a wide variety
of problems, although it remains underutilized in this setting. We present
techniques for performing cutting edge 2D DMRG studies including methods for
ensuring convergence, extrapolating finite-size data and extracting gaps and

young and with different thresholds in metallicities, that can be sites of LRGB

with 18 observed LGRB hosts in the aim at discriminating whether the
metallicity is a primary parameter. We find that a threshold in metallicity for
the LGRB progenitors, within the model galaxies, is not necessary in order to
reproduce the observed distribution of host metallicities. The low
metallicities of observed LGRB hosts is a consequence of the high star
formation environment. The star formation rate appears to be the primary
parameter to generate a burst event. Finally, we show that only a few LGRBs are

yet since its inception, it has been afflicted with numerous conceptual
difficulties. The primary subject of this thesis is the theory of entropic
quantum dynamics (EQD), which seeks to avoid these conceptual problems by
interpreting quantum theory from an informational perspective.
  We begin by reviewing probability theory as a means of rationally quantifying
uncertainties. We then discuss how probabilities can be updated with the method
of maximum entropy (ME). We then review some motivating difficulties in quantum
mechanics before discussing Caticha's work in deriving quantum theory from the
approach of entropic dynamics.
  After entropic dynamics is introduced, we develop the concepts of symmetries
and transformations from an informational perspective. The primary result is
the formulation of a symmetry condition that any transformation must satisfy in
order to qualify as a symmetry in EQD. We then proceed to apply this condition
to the extended Galilean transformation. This transformation is of interest as
it exhibits features of both special and general relativity. The transformation
yields a gravitational potential that arises from an equivalence of
information.
  We conclude the thesis with a discussion of the measurement problem in
quantum mechanics. We discuss the difficulties that arise in the standard
quantum mechanical approach to measurement before developing our theory of
entropic measurement. In entropic dynamics, position is the only observable. We
show how a theory built on this one observable can account for the multitude of
measurements present in quantum theory. Furthermore, we show that the Born rule
need not be postulated, but can be derived in EQD. Finally, we show how the
wave function can be updated by the ME method as the phase is constructed
purely in terms of probabilities.

fractions $\nu$ in the lowest and the second Landau levels: $\nu$ = 1/3, 7/3,
1/2, and 5/2. We observe that the entanglement measures are dependent on which

1/3 and 7/3, which are considered to be Laughlin states, weaken with $d$ in the
lowest Landau level ($\nu$=1/3) and strengthen with $d$ in the second Landau
level ($\nu$=7/3). For the enigmatic even-denominator $\nu=5/2$ state, we find
that entanglement in the ground state is consistent with that of the

that the single-layer $\nu = 1/2$ system is not a fractional quantum Hall state

findings based on entanglement considerations are completely consistent with

new strategy to generate complex behaviour of an autonomous robot. In the
presented system, 18 sensors drive 18 motors via a simple neural control
circuit, thereby generating 11 basic behavioural patterns (e.g., orienting,

Our study is made in the quenched approximation at the lattice spacing of a =

distinguish a bound state from an attractive scattering state, we investigate
the volume dependence of the energy difference between the ground state and the

fm to 12.3 fm. A finite energy difference left in the infinite spatial volume
limit leads us to the conclusion that the measured ground states for not only

of the bound state is confirmed by investigating the properties of the energy
for the first excited state obtained by 2x2 diagonalization method. The
scattering lengths for both channels are evaluated by applying the finite

the QSO lifetime. Observations on the PE so far, however, give apparently
contradictory results -- some are consistent with a long QSO lifetime (>~ a few
10^7 yr), but others appear to be only consistent with a short QSO lifetime <~
10^6 yr. In this paper, we show that this apparent contradiction may be solved
by simultaneously taking into account both the effect due to the density
enhancement in the QSO near zones and that due to the obscuration of the tori
associated with the QSOs, using a large number of Monte-Carlo generated
synthetic Lyman alpha forest spectra. We demonstrate that the QSO properties
and environment can be constrained simultaneously by the transverse PE and the
line of sight PE of bright type 1 QSOs together. The current available
measurements on the PEs of type 1 QSOs suggest that (1) the density is
significantly enhanced in the vicinity of the QSOs; (2) the QSO lifetime is
consistent with being as large as a few 10^7 yr and a substantially shorter
lifetime (e.g., <~10^6 yr) is not required; and (3) the half opening angle of
the tori associated with QSOs is ~60 deg, consistent with some other
independent estimates. Our simulations also show that the TPE of type 2 QSOs
can be significantly different from that of type 1 QSOs, which may be useful to
put further constraints on the QSO properties and the QSO environment.

dynamical products of interactions between (binary) stars and the massive black
hole(s) (MBH) in the Galactic center (GC). It has been shown that the detected
HVSs are spatially consistent with being located on two thin disks (Lu et al.),
one of which has the same orientation as the clockwise-rotating stellar disk in
the GC. Here we perform a large number of three-body experiments of the
interactions between the MBH and binary stars bound to it, and find that the
probability of ejecting HVSs is substantially enhanced by multiple encounters
between the MBH and binary stars at distances substantially larger than the
initial tidal breakup radii. Assuming that the HVS progenitors are originated
from the two disks, the inclination distribution of the HVSs relative to the
disk planes can be reproduced by either the mechanism of tidal breakup of
binary stars or the mechanism of ejecting HVSs by a hypothetical binary black
hole (BBH) in the GC. However, an isotropical origination of HVS progenitors is
inconsistent with the observed inclination distribution. Assuming that the HVSs
were ejected out by the tidal breakup mechanism, its velocity distribution can
be reproduced if their progenitors diffuse onto low angular momentum orbits
slowly and most of the progenitors were broken up at relatively large distances
due to multiple encounters. Assuming that the HVSs were ejected out by a BBH
within the allowed parameter space in the GC, our simulations produce
relatively flatter velocity spectra compared to the observed ones; however, the
BBH mechanism cannot be statistically ruled out, yet. Future surveys of HVSs
and better statistics of their spatial and velocity distributions should enable
to distinguish the ejection mechanisms of HVSs and shed new light on the
dynamical environment of the MBH.(abridged)

""magic cube"". It is a well-known planning problem, which has been studied for a
long time. Yet many simple properties remain unknown. This paper studies
whether modern SAT solvers are applicable to this puzzle. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to translate Rubik's Cube to a SAT problem. To
reduce the number of variables and clauses needed for the encoding, we replace
a naive approach of 6 Boolean variables to represent each color on each facelet
with a new approach of 3 or 2 Boolean variables. In order to be able to solve
quickly Rubik's Cube, we replace the direct encoding of 18 turns with the layer
encoding of 18-subtype turns based on 6-type turns. To speed up the solving
further, we encode some properties of two-phase algorithm as an additional
constraint, and restrict some move sequences by adding some constraint clauses.
Using only efficient encoding cannot solve this puzzle. For this reason, we
improve the existing SAT solvers, and develop a new SAT solver based on
PrecoSAT, though it is suited only for Rubik's Cube. The new SAT solver
replaces the lookahead solving strategy with an ALO (\emph{at-least-one})
solving strategy, and decomposes the original problem into sub-problems. Each
sub-problem is solved by PrecoSAT. The empirical results demonstrate both our
SAT translation and new solving technique are efficient. Without the efficient
SAT encoding and the new solving technique, Rubik's Cube will not be able to be
solved still by any SAT solver. Using the improved SAT solver, we can find
always a solution of length 20 in a reasonable time. Although our solver is
slower than Kociemba's algorithm using lookup tables, but does not require a
huge lookup table.

(tau>1). We set out to investigate whether a strong Si absorption feature is a
good indicator for the presence of a heavily obscured AGN. We compile X-ray
spectroscopic observations available in the literature on the
optically-thick,tau(9.7)>1 sources from the IRAS Seyfert sample. We find that
the majority of the high-tau optically confirmed Seyferts (6/9) in this sample
are probably CT. Thus we provide direct evidence for a connection between
mid-IR optically-thick galaxies and CT AGN, with the success rate being close
to 70% in the local Universe. This is at least comparable, if not better, than
other rates obtained with photometric information in the mid to far-IR, or even
mid-IR to Xray. However, this technique cannot provide complete CT AGN
samples,ie there are many CT AGN which do not show significant Si absorption,
with the most notable example being N1068. Having assessed the validity of the
high 9.7micron technique locally, we attempt to construct a sample of candidate
CT AGN at higher redshifts. We compile a sample of 7 high-tau sources in the
GOODS and 5 in the Spitzer FLS. All these have been selected to have no PAH
features EW(6.2)<0.3 in order to maximize the probability that they are AGN. 6
out of 7 sources in the GOODS have been detected in X-rays, while for the five
FLS sources only X-ray flux upper limits are available. The high X-ray
luminosities of the detected GOODS sources corroborates that these are AGN. For
FLS, ancillary optical spectroscopy reveals hidden nuclei in two more sources.
SED fitting can support the presence of an AGN in the vast majority of sources.
We cannot derive useful X-ray spectroscopy constraints on whether these are CT.
However, the low LX/L6 ratios, suggest that at least 4 out of the 6 detected
sources in GOODS may be associated with CT AGN.

exhibit unexpected dynamical vortex effects. Collective pinning with a vortex
lattice configuration different from the expected fundamental triangular

triangular periodic potential is produced by channelling effects between
triangles. Interstitial vortices coexisting with pinned vortices in this
asymmetric potential, lead to ratchet reversal, i.e. a DC output voltage which
changes sign with the amplitude of an applied alternating drive current. In
this landscape, ratchet reversal is always observed at all magnetic fields (all
numbers of vortices) and at different temperatures. The ratchet reversal is
unambiguously connected to the presence of two locations for the vortices:
interstitial and above the artificial pinning sites.

trajectories in the t-channel, in addition to the proton- and Delta-pole, in
the s- and u-channels respectively, and the contact-interaction contributions.
A specific scheme for the form factor which satisfies the Ward-Takahashi
identity, crossing symmetry, and on-shell condition, is taken into account. To
discuss the validity of the Regge approach within the Effective Lagrangian
method, we also consider a smooth interpolation between the Regge- and
Feynman-propagators for the t-channel meson exchanges as a function of sqrt(s).
We present the numerical results for the energy and angular dependences of the
cross sections, and double-polarization observable. It turns out that the
present framework shows the significance of the pi-exchange and contact
interaction terms to reproduce the experimental data qualitatively well.
Especially, the interpolation between the two propagators plays a crucial role
to reproduce the high-energy experimental data. The pi^+ decay-angle
distribution is also studied using the Delta^++ decay frame, i.e. the
Gottfried-Jackson frame. The present results will be a useful guide for future
