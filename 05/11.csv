used XMM-Newton to perform X-ray wind tomography of a specific of these
systems, IGR J17252-3616, featuring eclipses of the accreting pulsar. The X-ray
band (0.2-10 keV) reveals vital information on the geometry of the surrounding
gas probing simultaneously the absorption and the fluorescence emission. The
XMM observations were scheduled to cover as many orbital phases as possible.
Timing analysis allows the derivation of an accurate orbital solution and of
the system parameters. Spectral analysis revealed remarkable variations of the
absorbing column density along the orbit and of the Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence
line around the eclipse. The combination of these observables revealed a highly
asymmetric and unprecedentedly extended structure in the stellar wind extending
up to 2-3 stellar radii. The observations can be modeled in terms of three
independent components: i) the unperturbed stellar wind ii) the contribution of
a highly asymmetric hydrodynamic wind tail-like structure and iii) a cusp of
material close to the neutron star. These dynamical structures are imaged for
the first time in a sgHMXB and explain the source of the high obscuration.

interesting quantities in studies of nonlinear hierarchical clustering. These
include the halo mass function, halo merger rates, halo formation times and
masses, halo clustering, analogous quantities for voids, and the distribution
of dark matter counts in randomly placed cells. The approach assumes that all
these quantities can be mapped to problems involving the first crossing
distribution of a suitably chosen barrier by random walks. Most analytic
expressions for these distributions ignore the fact that, although different
k-modes in the initial Gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is not true in
real space: the values of the density field at a given spatial position, when
smoothed on different real-space scales, are correlated in a nontrivial way. As
a result, the problem is to estimate first crossing distribution by random
walks having correlated rather than uncorrelated steps. In 1990, Peacock &
Heavens presented a simple approximation for the first crossing distribution of
a single barrier of constant height by walks with correlated steps. We show
that their approximation can be thought of as a correction to the distribution
associated with what we call smooth completely correlated walks. We then use
this insight to extend their approach to treat moving barriers, as well as
walks that are constrained to pass through a certain point before crossing the
barrier. For the latter, we show that a simple rescaling, inspired by bivariate
Gaussian statistics, of the unconditional first crossing distribution,
accurately describes the conditional distribution, independently of the choice
of analytical prescription for the former. In all cases, comparison with
Monte-Carlo solutions of the problem shows reasonably good agreement.

the case of {\em massless} $\lambda \phi^{2n}$ quantum field theory on deSitter
spacetime. As in that paper, our key objective is to derive a suitable
""Mellin-Barnes-type"" representation of deSitter correlation functions in a
deSitter-invariant state, which holds to arbitrary orders in perturbation
theory, and which incorporates renormalization. The representation is suitable
for the study of large distance/time properties of correlation functions. It is
arrived at via an analytic continuation from the corresponding objects on the
sphere, and, as in the massive case, relies on the use of graph-polynomials and
their properties, as well as other tools. However, the perturbation expansion
is organized somewhat differently in the massless case, due to the well-known
subtleties associated with the ""zero-mode"" of the quantum field. In particular,
the correlation functions do not possess a well-defined limit as the
self-coupling constant of the field goes to zero, reflecting the well-known
non-existence of a deSitter invariant state in the free massless scalar theory.
We establish that generic correlation functions cannot grow more than
polynomially in proper time for large time-like separations of the points. Our
results thus leave open the possibility of quantum induced IR-instabilities of
deSitter spacetime on very large time-scales.

seek some reassurance that the output is correct and complete. Yet recomputing
the output as a check is inefficient and expensive, and it may not even be
feasible to store all the data locally. We are therefore interested in proof
systems which allow a service provider to prove the correctness of its output
to a streaming (sublinear space) user, who cannot store the full input or
perform the full computation herself.
  Our approach is two-fold. First, we describe a carefully chosen instantiation
of one of the most efficient general-purpose constructions for arbitrary
computations (streaming or otherwise), due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum.
This requires several new insights to make the methodology more practical. Our
main contribution is in achieving a prover who runs in time O(S(n) log S(n)),
where S(n) is the size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of
interest. Our experimental results demonstrate that a practical general-purpose
protocol for verifiable computation may be significantly closer to reality than
previously realized.
  Second, we describe techniques that achieve genuine scalability for protocols
fine-tuned for specific important problems in streaming and database
processing. Focusing in particular on non-interactive protocols for problems
ranging from matrix-vector multiplication to bipartite perfect matching, we
build on prior work to achieve a prover who runs in nearly linear-time, while
obtaining optimal tradeoffs between communication cost and the user's working
memory. Existing techniques required (substantially) superlinear time for the
prover. We argue that even if general-purpose methods improve, fine-tuned
protocols will remain valuable in real-world settings for key problems, and
hence special attention to specific problems is warranted.

sources which can produce photons one by one at given times, with reduced
intensity noise. However, the light field emitted by a single atom can exhibit
much richer dynamics. A prominent example is the predicted ability for a single
atom to produce quadrature-squeezed light, with sub-shot-noise amplitude or
phase fluctuations. It has long been foreseen, though, that such squeezing
would be ""at least an order of magnitude more difficult"" to observe than the
emission of single photons. Squeezed beams have been generated using
macroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms, but despite
experimental efforts, single-atom squeezing has so far escaped observation.
Here we generate squeezed light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical
resonator. The strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a
genuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity, several orders of magnitude larger
than for usual macroscopic media. This produces observable quadrature squeezing
with an excitation beam containing on average only two photons per system
lifetime. In sharp contrast to the emission of single photons, the squeezed
light stems from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system.
The ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between
propagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with
single emitters

According to this model, the initial orbital configuration of the giant planets
was much more compact than the one we observe today. We study the formation of
the giant planets in connection with some parameters that describe the
protoplanetary disk. The aim of this study is to establish the conditions that
favor their simultaneous formation in line with the initial configuration
proposed by the Nice model. We focus in the conditions that lead to the
simultaneous formation of two massive cores, corresponding to Jupiter and
Saturn, able to achieve the cross-over mass (where the mass of the envelope of
the giant planet equals the mass of the core, and gaseous runway starts) while
Uranus and Neptune have to be able to grow to their current masses. We compute
the in situ planetary formation, employing the numerical code introduced in our
previous work, for different density profiles of the protoplanetary disk.
Planetesimal migration is taken into account and planetesimals are considered
to follow a size distribution between $r_p^{min}$ (free parameter) and
$r_p^{max}= 100$ km. The core's growth is computed according to the oligarchic
growth regime. The simultaneous formation of the giant planets was successfully
completed for several initial conditions of the disk. We find that for
protoplanetary disks characterized by a power law ($\Sigma \propto r^{-p}$),
smooth surface density profiles ($p \leq 1.5$) favor the simultaneous
formation. However, for steep slopes ($p\sim 2$, as previously proposed by
other authors) the simultaneous formation of the solar system giant planets is
unlikely ...

done by looking at the hottest (bluest) stars of a population. Using the
turn-off temperature of a population of a given metallicity, we looked for the
isochrones with that turn-off temperature and metallicity and found no age
gradient as a function of metallicity. This would mean that this dominating
population of the Galactic halo formed rapidly, probably during the collapse of
the proto-Galactic gas. Moreover, we could find a significant number of stars
with hotter temperatures than the turn-off, which might be blue horizontal
branch (BHB) stars, blue stragglers, or main sequence stars that are younger
than the dominant population and were probably formed in external galaxies and
accreted later on to our Milky Way. Motivated by the current debate about the
efficiency of gravitational settling (atomic diffusion) in the interior of old
solar-type stars, we used isochrones with and without settling to determine the
ages. When ignoring diffusion in the isochrones we obtained ages of 14-16 Gyr.
This result is a strong argument against inhibited diffusion in old halo field
stars, since it results in a serious conflict with the age of the Universe of
13.7 Gyr. The age obtained including diffusion in the isochrones was 10-12 Gyr,
which agrees with the absolute age of the old globular clusters in the inner

0.92 +/- 0.1 M_solar, we find M_2 = 0.610 +/- 0.036 M_solar, R_1 = 0.932 +/-
0.076 R_solar and R_2 = 0.559 +/- 0.102 R_solar, and find that both stars have
masses and radii consistent with model predictions. TYC 1422-01328-1 is a
triple-component system for which we can directly measure the masses and radii
of the eclipsing pair. We find that the eclipsing pair consists of an evolved
primary star (M_1 = 1.163 +/- 0.034 M_solar, R_1 = 2.063 +/- 0.058 R_solar) and
a G-type dwarf secondary (M_2 = 0.905 +/- 0.067 M_solar, R_2 = 0.887 +/- 0.037

relation to more local spacetime approaches. Prominent among the problems of
quantum gravity are those of unitarity and observables. In a unitary theory
with solutions approximating Minkowski space, the S-matrix (or, in four
dimensions, related inclusive probabilities) should be sharply formulated and
physical. Features of its perturbative description are reviewed. A successful
quantum gravity theory should in particular address the questions posed by the
ultrahigh-energy regime. Some control can be gained in this regime by varying
the impact parameter as well as the collision energy. However, with decreasing
impact parameter gravity becomes strong, first eikonalizing, and then entering
the regime where in the classical approximation black holes form. Here one
confronts what may be the most profound problem of quantum gravity, that of
providing unitary amplitudes, as seen through the information problem of black
hole evaporation. Existing approaches to quantum gravity leave a number of
unanswered questions in this regime; there are strong indications that new
principles and mechanisms are needed, and in particular there is a good case
that usual notions of locality are inaccurate. One approach to these questions
is investigation of the approximate local dynamics of spacetime, its
observables, and its limitations; another is to directly explore properties of
the gravitational S-matrix, such as analyticity, crossing, and others implied
by gravitational physics.

constraining the nature of the cosmic acceleration, through measurements of

measurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity D_A^2/H. However,
to break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure the
anisotropic correlation function as a function of both line-of-sight (radial)
and transverse separations. Here we investigate how to most effectively do so,
using analytic techniques and mock catalogues. In particular, we examine
multipole expansions of the correlation function as well as ""clustering wedges""
xi(Delta mu, s), where mu = s_||/s and s_|| is the radial component of
separation s. Both techniques allow strong constraints on H and D_A, as
expected. The radial wedges strongly depend on H and the transverse wedges are
sensitive to D_A. Analyses around the region of the acoustic peak constrain H
~20% better when using the wedge statistics than when using the
monopole-quadrupole combination. However, we show that the hexadecapole allows
substantially stronger constraints than the monopole and quadrupole alone. Our
findings here demonstrate that wedge statistics provide a practical alternative
technique to multipoles, that should be useful to test systematics and will
provide comparable or better constraints. Finally, we predict the constraints
from galaxy clustering that will be possible with a completed version of the
ongoing Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey.

z\sim8 galaxies are combined with new LFs for z\sim5-6 galaxies and the earlier
z\sim4 LF to reach to very faint limits (<0.05 L*(z=3)). The faint-end slopes
alpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z\sim5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z\sim6), -2.01+/-0.21
(z\sim7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z\sim8). Slopes alpha\lesssim-2 lead to formally
divergent UV fluxes, though galaxies are not expected to form below \sim-10 AB
mag. These results have important implications for reionization. The weighted
mean slope at z\sim6-8 is -1.87+/-0.13. For such steep slopes, and a faint-end
limit of -10 AB mag, galaxies provide a very large UV ionizing photon flux.
While current results show that galaxies can reionize the universe by z\sim6,
matching the Thomson optical depths is more challenging. Extrapolating the
current LF evolution to z>8, taking alpha to be -1.87+/-0.13 (the mean value at
z\sim6-8), and adopting typical parameters, we derive Thomson optical depths of
0.061_{-0.006}^{+0.009}. However, this result will change if the faint-end
slope alpha is not constant with redshift. We test this hypothesis and find a
weak, though uncertain, trend to steeper slopes at earlier times
(dalpha/dz\sim-0.05+/-0.04), that would increase the Thomson optical depths to
0.079_{-0.017}^{+0.063}, consistent with recent WMAP estimates
(tau=0.088+/-0.015). It may thus not be necessary to resort to extreme
assumptions about the escape fraction or clumping factor. Nevertheless, the
uncertainties remain large. Deeper WFC3/IR+ACS observations can further

the predicted HI and HeII photoionization and photoheating rates for use, e.g.,
in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of the Lya forest, and a new
metallicity-dependent calibration to the UV luminosity density-star formation
rate density relation. A ""minimal cosmic reionization model"" is also presented

instance of SubMP consists of a finite ground set $V$, a subset of $k$ elements
$S = \{s_1,s_2,...,s_k\}$ called terminals, and a non-negative submodular set
function $f:2^V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ on $V$ provided as a value oracle. The
goal is to partition $V$ into $k$ sets $A_1,...,A_k$ such that for $1 \le i \le
k$, $s_i \in A_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^k f(A_i)$ is minimized. SubMP generalizes
some well-known problems such as the Multiway Cut problem in graphs and
hypergraphs, and the Node-weighed Multiway Cut problem in graphs. SubMP for
arbitrarysubmodular functions (instead of just symmetric functions) was
considered by Zhao, Nagamochi and Ibaraki \cite{ZhaoNI05}. Previous algorithms
were based on greedy splitting and divide and conquer strategies. In very
recent work \cite{ChekuriE11} we proposed a convex-programming relaxation for
SubMP based on the Lov\'asz-extension of a submodular function and showed its
applicability for some special cases. In this paper we obtain the following
results for arbitrary submodular functions via this relaxation. (i) A
2-approximation for SubMP. This improves the $(k-1)$-approximation from
\cite{ZhaoNI05} and (ii) A $(1.5-1/k)$-approximation for SubMP when $f$ is
symmetric. This improves the $2(1-1/k)$-approximation from

systems is well reproduced by a model in which planet assembly occurs in situ,
with no significant migration post-assembly. This is achieved only if the
amount of mass in rocky material is $\sim 50$--$100 M_{\oplus}$ interior to 1
AU. Such a reservoir of material implies that significant radial migration of
solid material takes place, and that it occur before the stage of final planet
assembly.
  The model not only reproduces the general distribution of mass versus period,
but also the detailed statistics of multiple planet systems in the sample.
  We furthermore demonstrate that cores of this size are also likely to meet
the criterion to gravitationally capture gas from the nebula, although
accretion is rapidly limited by the opening of gaps in the gas disk. If the
mass growth is limited by this tidal truncation, then the scenario sketched
here naturally produces Neptune-mass objects with substantial components of
both rock and gas, as is observed.
  The quantitative expectations of this scenario are that most planets in the
`Hot Neptune/Super-Earth' class inhabit multiple-planet systems, with
characteristic orbital spacings. The model also provides a natural division
into gas-rich (Hot Neptune) and gas-poor (Super-Earth) classes at fixed period.
The dividing mass ranges from $\sim 3 M_{\oplus}$ at 10 day orbital periods to
$\sim 10 M_{\oplus}$ at 100 day orbital periods. For orbital periods $< 10$
days, the division is less clear because a gas atmosphere may be significantly
eroded by stellar radiation.

for a reason: no definite state of affairs can come into being unless there is
a sufficient reason why that particular thing should happen. This principle is
usually attributed to Leibniz, although the first recorded Western philosopher
to use it was Anaximander of Miletus. The demand that nature be rational, in
the sense that it be compatible with the principle of sufficient reason,
conflicts with a basic feature of contemporary orthodox physical theory, namely
the notion that nature's response to the probing action of an observer is
determined by pure chance, and hence on the basis of absolutely no reason at
all. This appeal to pure chance can be deemed to have no rational fundamental
place in reason-based Western science. It is argued here, on the basis of the
other basic principles of quantum physics, that in a world that conforms to the
principle of sufficient reason, the usual quantum statistical rules will
naturally emerge at the pragmatic level, in cases where the reason behind
nature's choice of response is unknown, but that the usual statistics can
become biased in an empirically manifest way when the reason for the choice is
empirically identifiable. It is shown here that if the statistical laws of
quantum mechanics were to be biased in this way then the basically
forward-in-time unfolding of empirical reality described by orthodox quantum
mechanics would generate the appearances of backward-time-effects of the kind
that have been reported in the scientific literature.

light curves on dynamical and physical properties of such a transient disk
during its existence. One of main results derived from our simulations is that
black body fits of X-ray data tend to overestimate the true mean disk
temperature. The temperature derived from black body fits should be identified
with the color X-ray temperature rather than the average value derived from the
true temperature distribution along the disk. The time interval between the
beginning of the circularization of the bound debris and the beginning of the
accretion process by the black hole is determined by the viscous timescale,
which fixes also the raising part of the resulting light curve. The luminosity
peak coincides with the beginning of matter accretion by the black hole and the
late evolution of the light curve depends on the evolution of the debris
fallback rate. Peak bolometric luminosities are in the range 10^45-10^46 erg
s^-1 whereas peak luminosities in soft X-rays (0.2-2.0 keV) are typically one
order of magnitude lower. The timescale derived from our preferred models for

fast parton and its medium-induced bremsstrahlung gluons to a thermalized

spectra as in supernovae can be understood in terms of the response of
individual neutrino flavor-isospins (NFIS's) to the mean field. In the case of
a system initially consisting of nu_e and anti-nu_e with the same energy
spectrum but different number densities, the mean field is very well
approximated by the total angular momentum of a neutrino gyroscope. Assuming
that NFIS evolution is independent of the initial neutrino emission angle, the
so-called single-angle approximation, we find that the evolution is governed by
two types of resonances driven by precession and nutation of the gyroscope,
respectively. The net flavor transformation crucially depends on the
adiabaticity of evolution through these resonances. We show that the results
for the system of two initial neutrino species can be extended to a system of
four species with the initial number densities of nu_e and anti-nu_e
significantly larger than those of nu_x and anti-nu_x. Further, we find that
when the dependence on the initial neutrino emission angle is taken into
account in the multi-angle approximation, nutation of the mean field is quickly
damped out and can be neglected. In contrast, precession-driven resonances
still govern the evolution of NFIS's with different energy and emission angles
just as in the single-angle approximation. Our pedagogical and analytic study
of collective neutrino oscillations in supernovae provides some insights into
these seemingly complicated yet fascinating phenomena.

have well-defined interactions (e.g., predator-prey, mutualistic or
competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find
remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which increase
stability, and mutualistic and competitive, which are destabilizing. We provide
analytic stability criteria for all cases. These results have broad
applicability in ecology. For example, we show that, surprisingly, the
probability of stability for predator-prey networks is decreased when we impose
realistic food web structure or we introduce a large preponderance of weak
interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively impacted by nestedness in
bipartite mutualistic networks.

determined by the s,p-d exchange coupling to magnetic ions, by the
electron-hole s-p exchange, and the spin-orbit interactions. A quantitative
description of the magnetoreflectivity findings indicates that the free
excitons A and B are associated with the Gamma_7 and Gamma_9 valence bands,
respectively, the order reversed as compared to wurtzite GaN. Furthermore, our
results show that the magnitude of the giant exciton splittings, specific to
dilute magnetic semiconductors, is unusual: the magnetoreflectivity data is
described by an effective exchange energy N_0(beta-alpha)=+0.2+/-0.1 eV, what
points to small and positive N_0 beta. It is shown that both the increase of
the gap with x and the small positive value of the exchange energy N_0 beta
corroborate recent theory describing the exchange splitting of the valence band

signals. If gravity is not described by General Relativity, analyses that are
based on waveforms derived from Einstein's field equations could result in
parameter biases and a loss of detection efficiency. A new class of
""parameterized post-Einsteinian"" (ppE) waveforms has been proposed to cover
this eventuality. Here we apply the ppE approach to simulated data from a
network of advanced ground based interferometers (aLIGO/aVirgo) and from a
future spaced based interferometer (LISA). Bayesian inference and model
selection are used to investigate parameter biases, and to determine the level
at which departures from general relativity can be detected. We find that in
some cases the parameter biases from assuming the wrong theory can be severe.
We also find that gravitational wave observations will beat the existing bounds
on deviations from general relativity derived from the orbital decay of binary
pulsars by a large margin across a wide swath of parameter space.

TeV string scale. Because we can access regimes where 2 dimensions are
hierarchically larger than the other 4, we find examples where 2 dimensions are
micron-sized while the other 4 are at the weak scale in addition to standard
examples with all 6 EDs equally large. Besides providing UV completeness, the
phenomenology of these models is richer than vanilla large-dimensional models
in several ways: (i) they are supersymmetric, with SUSY broken at sub-eV scales
in the bulk but only nonlinearly realised in the SM sector, leading to no MSSM
superpartners and many more bulk missing-energy channels, as in supersymmetric
large extra dimensions (SLED); (ii) small cycles in the complicated
extra-dimensional geometry allow some KK states to reside at TeV scales even if
all 6 EDs are much larger; (iii) a rich spectrum of string and KK states at TeV
scales; and (iv) an equally rich spectrum of light moduli having unusually
small (but technically natural) masses, with potentially interesting
implications for cosmology and astrophysics that nonetheless evade new-force
constraints. The hierarchy problem is solved because the extra-dimensional
volume is naturally stabilised at exponentially large values: the EDs are CY
geometries with a 4D K3 or T^4-fibration over a 2D base, with moduli stabilised
within the LARGE-Volume scenario. The new technical step is the use of
poly-instanton corrections to the superpotential (which, unlike for simpler
models, are likely to be present on K3 or T^4-fibered CY compactifications) to
obtain a large hierarchy between the sizes of different dimensions. For several
scenarios we identify the low-energy spectrum and briefly discuss some of their
astrophysical, cosmological and phenomenological implications.

reveals how the Ising chains interact with one another. The relationships
discussed in this paper allow us to consider these models from two different

allow us to learn more about the relation between the ground state properties

$p \rightarrow 0$, keeping $\tilde{p}$ constant, in a class of such models.
This transition is driven by bond energetics and can be either continuous or

polymer takes the shape, above the critical pressure, of a regular N-gon whose
sides scale smoothly with pressure, while staying unfaceted below this critical
pressure. In the general case, we argue that the transition is replaced by a
sharp crossover. The area, however, scales with $N^2$ for all positive $p$ in
all such models, consistent with earlier scaling theories.

chains of superclusters; one of them is the Sloan Great Wall. Most
superclusters have filament-like overall shapes. Superclusters can be divided
into two sets; more elongated superclusters are more luminous, richer, have
larger diameters, and a more complex fine structure than less elongated
superclusters. The fine structure of superclusters can be divided into four
main morphological types: spiders, multispiders, filaments, and multibranching

Finsler space, as oriented curves. In Theorem 3.8 we reformulate the projective
metrizability problem for a spray in terms of a first-order partial
differential operator $P_1$ and a set of algebraic conditions on semi-basic
1-forms. We discuss the formal integrability of $P_1$ using two sufficient
conditions provided by Cartan-K\""ahler theorem. We prove in Theorem 4.2 that
the symbol of $P_1$ is involutive and hence one of the two conditions is always
satisfied. While discussing the second condition, in Theorem 4.3 we prove that
there is only one obstruction to the formal integrability of $P_1$, and this
obstruction is due to the curvature tensor of the induced nonlinear connection.
When the curvature obstruction is satisfied, the projective metrizability
problem reduces to the discussion of the algebraic conditions, which as we show
are always satisfied in the analytic case. Based on these results, we recover
all classes of sprays that are known to be projectively metrizable: flat
sprays, isotropic sprays, and arbitrary sprays on 1- and 2-dimensional
manifolds. We provide examples of sprays that are projectively metrizable
without being Finsler metrizable.

disasters and the simulation of pedestrian flows have become important research
areas. Yet, even successful modeling approaches such as those inspired by
Newtonian force models are still not fully consistent with empirical
observations and are sometimes hard to calibrate. Here, a novel cognitive
science approach is proposed, which is based on behavioral heuristics. We
suggest that, guided by visual information, namely the distance of obstructions
in candidate lines of sight, pedestrians apply two simple cognitive procedures
to adapt their walking speeds and directions. While simpler than previous
approaches, this model predicts individual trajectories and collective patterns
of motion in good quantitative agreement with a large variety of empirical and
experimental data. This includes the emergence of self-organization phenomena,
such as the spontaneous formation of unidirectional lanes or stop-and-go waves.
Moreover, the combination of pedestrian heuristics with body collisions
generates crowd turbulence at extreme densities-a phenomenon that has been
observed during recent crowd disasters. By proposing an integrated treatment of
simultaneous interactions between multiple individuals, our approach overcomes
limitations of current physics-inspired pair interaction models. Understanding
crowd dynamics through cognitive heuristics is therefore not only crucial for a
better preparation of safe mass events. It also clears the way for a more
realistic modeling of collective social behaviors, in particular of human
crowds and biological swarms. Furthermore, our behavioral heuristics may serve
to improve the navigation of autonomous robots.

contrast in the observation of exoplanets. A checkerboard mask, a kind of
binary-shaped pupil mask, was used. We improved the temperature stability by
installing the coronagraph optics in a vacuum chamber, controlling the
temperature of the optical bench, and covering the vacuum chamber with thermal
insulation layers. We evaluated how much the PSF subtraction contributes to the
high contrast observation by subtracting the images obtained through the
coronagraph. We also carried out multi- band experiments in order to
demonstrate a more realistic observation using Super luminescent Light Emitting
Diodes (SLEDs) with center wavelengths of 650nm, 750nm, 800nm and 850nm. A
contrast of 2.3x10-7 was obtained for the raw coronagraphic image and a
contrast of 1.3x10-9 was achieved after PSF subtraction with a He-Ne laser at
632.8nm wavelength. Thus, the contrast was improved by around two orders of
magnitude from the raw contrast by subtracting the PSF. We achieved contrasts
of 3.1x10-7, 1.1x10-6, 1.6x10-6 and 2.5x10-6 at the bands of 650nm, 750nm,
800nm and 850nm, respectively, in the multi-band experiments. The results show
that contrast within each of the wavelength bands was significantly improved
compared with non-coronagraphic optics. We demonstrated PSF subtraction is
potentially beneficial for improving contrast of the coronagraph, and this
coronagraph produces a significant improvement in contrast with multi-band
light sources.

spectral, variability and spatial characteristics, is calculated as it would be
seen from a certain direction. A generic case is studied first, and then the
specific case of LS 5039 is also considered. We find that, confirming previous
results, the secondary radio emission should appear as an extended radio
structure of a few milliarcseconds size. This radiation would be relatively
hard, with fluxes up to ~ 10 mJy. Modulation is expected depending on the
gamma-ray production luminosity, system eccentricity, and wind ionization
fraction, and to a lesser extent on the magnetic field structure. In gamma-ray
binaries in general, the pairs created due to photon-photon interactions can
contribute significantly to the core, and generate an extended structure. In

structures observed in cool chromospheric lines such as H$\alpha$ and

However, considered a peculiar sporadic phenomenon, it has not received much
attention. This picture is rapidly changing due to recent high resolution
observations with instruments such as \textit{Hinode}/SOT, CRISP of
\textit{SST} and \textit{SDO}. Furthermore, numerical simulations have shown
that coronal rain is a loss of thermal equilibrium of loops linked to footpoint
heating. This result has highlighted the importance that coronal rain can play
in the field of coronal heating. In this work, we further stress the importance
of coronal rain by showing the role it can play in the understanding of the
coronal magnetic field topology. We analyze \textit{Hinode}/SOT observations in
the \ion{Ca}{2} H line of a loop in which coronal rain puts in evidence
in-phase transverse oscillations of multiple strand-like structures. The
periods, amplitudes, transverse velocities and phase velocities are calculated,
allowing an estimation of the energy flux of the wave and the coronal magnetic
field inside the loop through means of coronal seismology. We discuss the
possible interpretations of the wave as either standing or propagating
torsional Alfv\'en or fast kink waves. An estimate of the plasma beta parameter
of the condensations indicates a condition that may allow the often observed
separation and elongation processes of the condensations. We also show that the
wave pressure from the transverse wave can be responsible for the observed low
downward acceleration of coronal rain.

entropy measure from information theory, the (nonconvex) objective function to
be optimized (maximized) is modeled and estimated by adopting a Bayesian
approach and using Gaussian processes as a state-of-the-art regression method.
The resulting iterative scheme allows the decision maker to solve the problem
by expressing preferences for each aspect quantitatively and concurrently.

simple model of mass transit dynamics. Symmetries are reflected in our approach
by a reduction of the minimal number of cycles needed in the decomposition.
These features are demonstrated by discussing a variant of an asymmetric
exclusion process (TASEP). Intriguingly, a continuous change of dominant flow
paths in the network results in a change of the structure of cycles as well as
in discontinuous jumps in cycle weights.

describe a similar change to Poisson distribution in the Scully-Lamb laser

2010 Oct 16, 19:05-19:35 UT, was triggered by an M2.9 GOES-class flare, located
inside a highly inclined cone of a narrow-angle CME. This oscillation event had
a number of unusual features: (i) Excitation of kink-mode oscillations in
vertical polarization (in the loop plane); (ii) Coupled cross-sectional and
density oscillations with identical periods; (iii) no detectable kink amplitude
damping over the observed duration of four kink-mode periods ($P=6.3$ min);
(iv) multi-loop oscillations with slightly ($\approx 10%$) different periods;
and (v) a relatively cool loop temperature of $T\approx 0.5$ MK. We employ a
novel method of deriving the electron density ratio external and internal to
the oscillating loop from the ratio of Alfv\'enic speeds deduced from the flare
trigger delay and the kink-mode period, i.e.,
$n_e/n_i=(v_A/v_{Ae})^2=0.08\pm0.01$. The coupling of the kink mode and
cross-sectional oscillations can be explained as a consequence of the loop
length variation in the vertical polarization mode. We determine the exact
footpoint locations and loop length with stereoscopic triangulation using
STEREO/EUVI-A data. We model the magnetic field in the oscillating loop using
HMI/SDO magnetogram data and a potential field model and find agreement with
the seismological value of the magnetic field, $B_{kink}=4.0\pm0.7$ G, within a
factor of two.

giant branch (AGB) phase of evolution. In about one percent of known Miras, the
pulsation period is changing. It has been speculated that this changing period
is the consequence of a recent thermal pulse in these stars. Aims: We aim to
clarify the evolutionary state of these stars, and to determine in particular
whether or not they are in the thermally-pulsing (TP-)AGB phase. Methods: One
important piece of information that has been neglected so far when determining
the evolutionary state is the presence of the radio-active s-process element
technetium (Tc). We obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise-ratio
optical spectra of a dozen prominent Mira variables with changing pulsation
period to search for this indicator of TPs and dredge-up. We also use the
spectra to measure lithium (Li) abundances. Furthermore, we establish the
evolutionary states of our sample stars by means of their present-day periods
and luminosities. Results: Among the twelve sample stars observed in this
programme, five were found to show absorption lines of Tc. BH Cru is found to
be a carbon-star, its period increase in the past decades possibly having
stopped by now. We report a possible switch in the pulsation mode of T UMi from
Mira-like to semi-regular variability in the past two years. R Nor, on the
other hand, is probably a fairly massive AGB star, which could be true for all
meandering Miras. Finally, we assign RU Vul to the metal-poor thick disk with
properties very similar to the short-period, metal-poor Miras. Conclusions: We
conclude that there is no clear correlation between period change class and Tc
presence. The stars that are most likely to have experienced a recent TP are BH
Cru and R Hya, although their rates of period change are quite different.

obtain profiles of metabolites dissolved in biofluids such as cell
supernatants. Methods for estimating metabolite concentrations from these
spectra are presently confined to manual peak fitting and to binning procedures
for integrating resonance peaks. Extensive information on the patterns of
spectral resonance generated by human metabolites is now available in online
databases. By incorporating this information into a Bayesian model we can
deconvolve resonance peaks from a spectrum and obtain explicit concentration
estimates for the corresponding metabolites. Spectral resonances that cannot be
deconvolved in this way may also be of scientific interest so we model them
jointly using wavelets.
  We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm which allows us to sample
from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters, using
specifically designed block updates to improve mixing. The strong prior on
resonance patterns allows the algorithm to identify peaks corresponding to
particular metabolites automatically, eliminating the need for manual peak
assignment.
  We assess our method for peak alignment and concentration estimation. Except
in cases when the target resonance signal is very weak, alignment is unbiased
and precise. We compare the Bayesian concentration estimates to those obtained
from a conventional numerical integration method and find that our point
estimates have sixfold lower mean squared error.
  Finally, we apply our method to a spectral dataset taken from an
investigation of the metabolic response of yeast to recombinant protein
expression. We estimate the concentrations of 26 metabolites and compare to
manual quantification by five expert spectroscopists. We discuss the reason for
discrepancies and the robustness of our methods concentration estimates.

found that, in order to obtain accurate results in homogeneous media, the grid
size can be as little as two points per wavelength, and for a moderately
nonlinear problem, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number can be as small as 0.4.
As a result, the k-space method for nonlinear wave propagation is shown here to
be computationally more efficient than the conventional finite element method

However, although the present method is highly accurate for weakly
inhomogeneous media, it is found to be less accurate for strongly inhomogeneous

information. The controller may have no a priori (or even posteriori) data on
the nonlinear system, except from a limited number of points that are obtained
over time. This is either due to high cost of observation or the highly
non-stationary nature of the system. The resulting conflict between information
collection (identification, exploration) and control (optimization,
exploitation) necessitates an active learning approach for iteratively
selecting the control actions which concurrently provide the data points for
system identification. This paper presents a dual control approach where the
information acquired at each control step is quantified using the entropy
measure from information theory and serves as the training input to a
state-of-the-art Gaussian process regression (Bayesian learning) method. The
explicit quantification of the information obtained from each data point allows
for iterative optimization of both identification and control objectives. The

devices and the widespread utilization of wireless and cellular data networks,
mobile users are increasingly requiring services tailored to their current
context. High-level context information is typically obtained from context
services that aggregate raw context information sensed by various sensors and
mobile devices. Given the massive amount of sensed data, traditional context
services are lacking the necessary resources to store and process these data,
as well as to disseminate high-level context information to a variety of
potential context consumers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for
context information provisioning, which relies on deploying context services on
the cloud and using context brokers to mediate between context consumers and
context services using a publish/subscribe model. Moreover, we describe a
multi-attributes decision algorithm for the selection of potential context
services that can fulfill context consumers' requests for context information.
The algorithm calculates the score of each context service, per context
information type, based on the quality-of-service (QoS) and quality-of-context
information (QoC) requirements expressed by the context consumer. One of the
benefits of the approach is that context providers can scale up and down, in
terms of cloud resources they use, depending on current demand for context
information. Besides, the selection algorithm allows ranking context services
by matching their QoS and QoC offers against the QoS and QoC requirements of
the context consumer.

CTS A08.12, and Mrk 110, including the UV range, to characterize the different
components that are emitting and absorbing radiation in the vicinity of the
active nucleus.
  Methods. The continuum emission was studied through the EPIC spectra by
taking advantage of the spectral range of these cameras. The high-resolution
RGS spectra were analyzed to characterize the absorbing and emission line
features that arise in the spectra of the sources. All these data, complemented
by information in the UV, are analyzed jointly in order to achieve a consistent
characterization of the observed features in each object.
  Results. The continuum emission of the sources can be characterized either by
a combination of a power law and a black body for the weakest objects or by two
power law components for the brightest ones. The continuum is not absorbed by
neutral or ionized material in the line of sight to any of these sources. In
all of them we have identified a narrow Fe-Kalpha line at 6.4 keV. In ESO
559-G19 we also find an FeXXVI line at about 7 keV. In the soft X-rays band, we
identify only one OVII line in the spectra of HE 1143-1810 and CTS A08.12, and
two OVII-He alpha triplets and a narrow OVIII-Ly alpha emission line in Mrk
110.
  Conclusions. Not detecting warm material in the line of sight to the low
state objects is due to intrinsically weaker or absent absorption in the line
of sight and not to a low signal-to-noise ratio in the data. Besides this, the
absence of clear emission lines cannot be fully attributed to dilution of those
lines by a strong continuum.

bifurcation parameter, i.e., of the driving force of the system. We explain
this behavior using saddle point methods and considering global topological
aspects of the problem. This then explains the non-monotonous force-velocity
dependence of certain driven interfaces.

multiplier approach is established, and the finite-sample performance of a
large number of candidate test statistics is studied through extensive Monte

case, the rejection rates of the best versions of the tests are compared with
those of the test of Ghoudi, Khoudraji and Rivest (1998) recently revisited by
Ben Ghorbal, Genest and Neslehova (2009). The proposed procedures are
illustrated on bivariate financial data and trivariate geological data.

The effect of single atom detuning, cavity decay rate and initial preparation
of the atoms on the corresponding correlation measures have been investigated.
It is found that even under strong dissipation, time evolution can create high
quantum discord while entanglement and Bell nonlocality stay zero for an
initially separable state. Quantum discord increases while entanglement
decreases in a certain time period under dissipation for the initial state that
both atoms are in the excited state if the qubits are identical. For some type
of initial states, cavity decay is shown to drive the system to a stationary

cooperative game theory. In coalitional games without externalities, it allows
to compute a unique payoff division that meets certain desirable fairness
axioms. However, in many realistic applications where externalities are
present, Shapley's axioms fail to indicate such a unique division.
Consequently, there are many extensions of Shapley value to the environment
with externalities proposed in the literature built upon additional axioms. Two
important such extensions are ""externality-free"" value by Pham Do and Norde and
value that ""absorbed all externalities"" by McQuillin. They are good reference
points in a space of potential payoff divisions for coalitional games with
externalities as they limit the space at two opposite extremes. In a recent,
important publication, De Clippel and Serrano presented a marginality-based
axiomatization of the value by Pham Do Norde. In this paper, we propose a dual
approach to marginality which allows us to derive the value of McQuillin. Thus,
we close the picture outlined by De Clippel and Serrano.

networks, focusing on the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering schemes. The
main motivation is to address the yet poorly understood size variation-induced
effect on power-aware buffering schemes. Our theoretical analysis elucidates
the fundamental differences between the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering
schemes in the presence of data size variation. It shows that data size
variation has detrimental effects on the power expenditure of the fixed-size
buffering in general, and reveals that the size variation induced effects can
be either mitigated by a positive skewness or promoted by a negative skewness
in size distribution. By contrast, the fixed-interval buffering scheme has an
obvious advantage of being eminently immune to the data-size variation. Hence
the fixed-interval buffering scheme is a risk-averse strategy for its
robustness in a variety of operational environments. In addition, based on the
fixed-interval buffering scheme, we establish the power consumption
relationship between child nodes and parent node in a static data collection
tree, and give an in-depth analysis of the impact of child bandwidth
distribution on parent's power consumption.
  This study is of practical significance: it sheds new light on the
relationship among power consumption of buffering schemes, power parameters of
radio module and memory bank, data arrival rate and data size variation,
thereby providing well-informed guidance in determining an optimal buffer size
(interval) to maximize the operational lifespan of sensor networks.

analyzed to study the deflections of CMEs during their propagation in the

graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model [Thernisien et al., 2006], it is found
that the propagation directions of eight CMEs had changed. By applying the
theoretical method proposed by Shen et al. [2011] to all the CMEs, we found
that the deflections are consistent, in strength and direction, with the
gradient of the magnetic energy density. There is a positive correlation
between the deflection rate and the strength of the magnetic energy density
gradient and a weak anti-correlation between the deflection rate and the CME
speed. Our results suggest that the deflections of CMEs are mainly controlled
by the background magnetic field and can be quantitatively described by the
