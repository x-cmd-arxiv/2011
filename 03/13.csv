cluster PKS 0745-191 in light of the recent Suzaku measurements. We analyze an
archival 10.5 ksec ROSAT/PSPC observation to extract the surface-brightness
profile of PKS 0745-191 and infer the deprojected density profile. We then
compare the ROSAT surface-brightness profile with the Suzaku result. We perform
a mass analysis combining the ROSAT density profile and the published
temperature profiles from different instruments. We find that the ROSAT
surface-brightness profile is statistically inconsistent (7.7 sigma) with the
Suzaku result around and beyond the value of r200 estimated by Suzaku. We argue
that, thanks to its large field of view and low background, ROSAT/PSPC is to
the present day the most sensitive instrument to low surface-brightness X-ray
emission in the 0.4-2.0 keV band. We also note that the Suzaku temperature and
mass profiles are at odds with the results from at least two other satellites
(XMM-Newton and Swift). The difference in surface brightness between ROSAT and
Suzaku is most likely explained by the existence of additional foreground
components at the low Galactic latitude of the source, which were not taken
into account in the Suzaku background modeling. In light of our mass analysis,
we conclude that any estimate of the fraction of the virial radius reached by
X-ray measures is affected by systematic errors of the order of 25%. As a
result, the properties of the ICM at the virial radius are still uncertain, and
the Suzaku results should be considered with caution.

satisfied and it has therefore explicit matrix representations. We investigate
the massless case and construct the irreducible representations of the extended

the patterns of the communities of workers and students, by applying grouping
methodologies based on the characterization of Sardinian commuters' system as a
complex weighted network. We adopt an algorithm based on the maximization of
the weighted modularity of this network to detect productive basins composed by
municipalities showing a certain degree of cohesiveness in terms of commuter
flows. The results obtained lead to conclude that new provinces in Sardinia
seem to have been designed -even unconsciously- as labour basins of
municipalities with similar commuting behaviour.

functions spaces $X\subset Y$ having similar scaling properties in the
following terms : a sequence $(u_n)_{n\geq 0}$ bounded in $X$ has a subsequence
that can be expressed as a finite sum of translations and dilations of
functions $(\phi_l)_{l>0}$ such that the remainder converges to zero in $Y$ as
the number of functions in the sum and $n$ tend to $+\infty$. Such a
decomposition was established by G\'erard for the embedding of the homogeneous
Sobolev space $X=\dot H^s$ into the $Y=L^p$ in $d$ dimensions with
$0<s=d/2-d/p$, and then generalized by Jaffard to the case where $X$ is a Riesz
potential space, using wavelet expansions. In this paper, we revisit the
wavelet-based profile decomposition, in order to treat a larger range of
examples of critical embedding in a hopefully simplified way. In particular we
identify two generic properties on the spaces $X$ and $Y$ that are of key use
in building the profile decomposition. These properties may then easily be
checked for typical choices of $X$ and $Y$ satisfying critical embedding
properties. These includes Sobolev, Besov, Triebel-Lizorkin, Lorentz, H\""older

  Carin","Blind Compressed Sensing Over a Structured Union of Subspaces",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous signal recovery and
dictionary learning based on compressive measurements. Multiple signals are
analyzed jointly, with multiple sensing matrices, under the assumption that the
unknown signals come from a union of a small number of disjoint subspaces. This
problem is important, for instance, in image inpainting applications, in which
the multiple signals are constituted by (incomplete) image patches taken from
the overall image. This work extends standard dictionary learning and
block-sparse dictionary optimization, by considering compressive measurements,
e.g., incomplete data). Previous work on blind compressed sensing is also
generalized by using multiple sensing matrices and relaxing some of the
restrictions on the learned dictionary. Drawing on results developed in the
context of matrix completion, it is proven that both the dictionary and signals
can be recovered with high probability from compressed measurements. The
solution is unique up to block permutations and invertible linear
transformations of the dictionary atoms. The recovery is contingent on the
number of measurements per signal and the number of signals being sufficiently
large; bounds are derived for these quantities. In addition, this paper
presents a computationally practical algorithm that performs dictionary
learning and signal recovery, and establishes conditions for its convergence to
a local optimum. Experimental results for image inpainting demonstrate the
capabilities of the method.

formation of large scale structure. This success brings to forefront the
question of naturalness: Does a sufficiently long slow roll inflation occur
generically or does it require a careful fine tuning of initial parameters? In
recent years there has been considerable controversy on this issue. In
particular, for a quadratic potential, Kofman, Linde and Mukhanov have argued
that the probability of inflation with at least 65 e-foldings is close to one,
while Gibbons and Turok have argued that this probability is suppressed by a
factor of ~ $\10^{-85}$. We first clarify that such dramatically different
predictions can arise because the required measure on the space of solutions is
intrinsically ambiguous in general relativity. We then show that this ambiguity
can be naturally resolved in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) because the big bang
is replaced by a big bounce and the bounce surface can be used to introduce the
structure necessary to specify a satisfactory measure.
  The second goal of the paper is to present a detailed analysis of the
inflationary dynamics of LQC using analytical and numerical methods. By
combining this information with the measure on the space of solutions, we
address a sharper question than those investigated in the literature: What is
the probability of a sufficiently long slow roll inflation WHICH IS COMPATIBLE
WITH THE SEVEN YEAR WMAP DATA? We show that the probability is very close to 1.
  The material is so organized that cosmologists who may be more interested in
the inflationary dynamics in LQC than in the subtleties associated with
measures can skip that material without loss of continuity.

hours) and the X-ray luminosities (10^{31.8-32.9} erg s^-1 at 8 kpc) of the 10
periodic sources, combined with the lack of bright optical counterparts and
thus high X-ray-to-optical flux ratios, suggest that they are likely accreting
binaries, in particular, magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs). All of the 10
sources exhibit a relatively hard X-ray spectrum (PLI<2 for a power law model)
and X-ray spectra of at least five show an extinction larger than the field
average expected from the interstellar medium in the region. The discovery of
these periodic X-ray sources in the LW further supports the current view that
MCVs constitute the majority of low luminosity hard X-ray sources (~10^{30-33}
erg s^-1) in the Bulge. The period distribution of these sources resembles
those of polars, whereas the relatively hard spectra suggest that they could be
intermediate polars (IPs). These puzzling properties can be explained by
unusual polars with buried magnetic fields or a rare sub-class of MCVs, nearly
synchronous MCVs. These unusual MCVs may provide important clues in the
evolutionary path of MCVs from IPs to polars. The completeness simulation
indicates >~40% of the hard X-ray sources in the LW are periodic. Therefore,
this discovery provides a first direct evidence of a large MCV population in
the Bulge.

effect in highly nontrivial ways. For the trait under evolutionary selection
(`fitness'), measured values over all possible combinations of a set of
mutations yield a fitness landscape that determines which mutational states can
be reached from a given initial genotype. Understanding the accessibility
properties of fitness landscapes is conceptually important in answering
questions about the predictability and repeatability of evolutionary
adaptation. Here we theoretically investigate accessibility of the globally
optimal state on a wide variety of model landscapes, including landscapes with
tunable ruggedness as well as neutral `holey' landscapes. We define a
mutational pathway to be accessible if it contains the minimal number of
mutations required to reach the target genotype, and if fitness increases in
each mutational step. Under this definition accessibility is high, in the sense
that at least one accessible pathwayexists with a substantial probability that
approaches unity as the dimensionality of the fitness landscape (set by the
number of mutational loci) becomes large. At the same time the number of
alternative accessible pathways grows without bound. We test the model
predictions against an empirical 8-locus fitness landscape obtained for the
filamentous fungus \textit{Aspergillus niger}. By analyzing subgraphs of the
full landscape containing different subsets of mutations, we are able to probe
the mutational distance scale in the empirical data. The predicted effect of
high accessibility is supported by the empirical data and very robust, which we
argue to reflect the generic topology of sequence spaces.

networking environment. In dynamic and decentralized settings where the
traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication
between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of
incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each
agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents.
In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous
learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the
context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation
techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in
terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts.
Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different
from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics,
logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics. We apply the results to a class
of security games in which the attacker and the defender adopt different
learning schemes due to differences in their rationality levels and the
information they acquire.

resembles the one at 8 $\mu$m that enhances the molecular cloud. We measure IR
SEDs within the shell and the PDRs. We use the DUSTEM model to fit the SEDs and
constrain dust temperature, dust size distribution, and ISRF intensity relative
to that provided by the star cluster NGC6611. Within the PDRs, the dust
temperature, the dust size distribution, and the ISRF intensity are in
agreement with expectations. Within the shell, the dust is hotter and an ISRF
larger than that provided by NGC6611 is required. We quantify two solutions.
(1) The size distribution of the dust in the shell is not that of interstellar
dust. (2) The dust emission arises from a hot plasma where UV and collisions
with electrons contribute to the heating. We suggest two interpretations for
the shell. (1) The shell matter is supplied by photo-evaporative flows arising
from dense gas exposed to ionized radiation. The flows renew the shell matter
as it is pushed by the stellar winds. Within this scenario, we conclude that
massive SFR such as M16 have a major impact on the carbon dust size
distribution. The grinding of the carbon dust could result from shattering in
collisions within shocks driven by the interaction between the winds and the
shell. (2) We consider a scenario where the shell is a SNR. We would be
witnessing a specific time in the evolution of the SNR where the plasma
pressure and temperature would be such that the SNR cools through dust
emission.

$r_{\Lambda}=ct_{\Lambda}=\sqrt{3/|\Lambda|}$. Conversely, any cosmological
length scale or time scale can introduce a $\Lambda (t)$,
$\Lambda(t)=3/r^2_{\Lambda}(t)=3/(c^2t^2_{\Lambda}(t))$. In this letter, we
investigate the time varying $\Lambda(t)$ corresponding to the length scales,
including the Hubble horizon, the particle horizon and the future event
horizon, and the time scales, including the age of the universe and the
conformal time. It is found out that, in this scenario, the $\Lambda(t)$CDM
model can be taken as the unified origin of the holographic and agegraphic dark
energy models with interaction between the matter and the dark energy, where
the interacting term is determined by $Q=-\dot{\rho}_{\Lambda}$. We place
observational constraints on the $\Lambda(t)$CDM models originating from
different cosmological length scales and time scales with the recently compiled
""Union2 compilation"" which consists of 557 Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) covering a
redshift range $0.015\leq z \leq 1.4$. In conclusion, an accelerating expansion

relations to the QCD amplitude of which the external fields are all massive or
include only one massless line. We find such amplitude can be split into two
parts and each part of the amplitude is of some correlated spin configuration
between the two shifted lines. After choosing proper momentum shift scheme, we
can show that each part is constructible directly. Hence, we can obtain a
general procedure for the amplitudes in QCD by the BCFW recursion relations. We
apply the procedure to several amplitudes as examples. We find such methods are
very efficient when there are many massive external fields in the amplitudes.

Every player reports to a scheduler the length of his job and the scheduler
needs to finish as many jobs as possible by the deadline. For this simple
problem, there is a truthful mechanism that achieves maximum welfare in
dominant strategies. The new aspect of our work is that in our setting players
are uncertain about their own job lengths, and hence are incapable of providing
truthful reports (in the strict sense of the word). For a probabilistic model
for uncertainty our main results are as follows.
  1) Even with relatively little uncertainty, no mechanism can guarantee a
constant fraction of the maximum welfare.
  2) To remedy this situation, we introduce a new measure of economic
efficiency, based on a notion of a {\em fair share} of a player, and design
mechanisms that are $\Omega(1)$-fair. In addition to its intrinsic appeal, our
notion of fairness implies good approximation of maximum welfare in several
cases of interest.
  3) In our mechanisms the machine is sometimes left idle even though there are
jobs that want to use it. We show that this unfavorable aspect is unavoidable,
unless one gives up other favorable aspects (e.g., give up
$\Omega(1)$-fairness).
  We also consider a qualitative approach to uncertainty as an alternative to
the probabilistic quantitative model. In the qualitative approach we break away
from solution concepts such as dominant strategies (they are no longer well
defined), and instead suggest an axiomatic approach, which amounts to listing
desirable properties for mechanisms. We provide a mechanism that satisfies
these properties.

nanowire with $<100>$ axial orientation and considered the effect of axial

with the force constant matrices extracted from interaction potential based on
the embedded atom method. Results for the vibrational density of states of a
strain-free nanowire show quite distinctive characteristics compared to that of
a bulk atom, the most striking feature of which is the existence of high
frequency modes above the top of the bulk spectrum. We further predict that the
low frequency characteristics of the VDOS reveal the quasi-1 dimensional (Q1D)
behavior only when the wire is extremely thin. Through decomposition of VDOS
into local atoms we also exhibit that while the anomalous increase in low
frequency density of states is mainly due to the corner atoms, the enhancement
in high frequency modes is primarily moderated by core atoms. We, additionally,
find that while the high frequency band above the top of the bulk phonon shifts
to higher frequencies, the characteristics at low frequencies remains almost
the same upon stretching the nanowire along the axial direction.

extend purely directed, acyclic graphs by two types of undirected graph, one

context vector variable. We review the special features and the history of
regression graphs, derive criteria to read all implied independences of a
regression graph and prove criteria for Markov equivalence that is to judge
whether two different graphs imply the same set of independence statements.
Knowledge of Markov equivalence provides alternative interpretations of a given
sequence of regressions, is essential for machine learning strategies and
permits to use the simple graphical criteria of regression graphs on graphs for
which the corresponding criteria are in general more complex. Under the known
conditions that a Markov equivalent directed acyclic graph exists for any given

remaining hidden magnetic fields can only be accessed with the Hanle effect.
Molecular lines are very convenient for applying the Hanle effect diagnostics
thanks to the broad range of magnetic sensitivities in a narrow spectral
region. With the UV version of the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter ZIMPOL II
installed at the 45 cm telescope of the Istituto Ricerche Solari Locarno
(IRSOL), we simultaneously observed intensity and linear polarization
center-to-limb variations in two spectral regions containing the (0,0) and
(1,1) bandheads of the CN B 2 {\Sigma} - X 2 {\Sigma} system. Here we present
an analysis of these observations. We have implemented coherent scattering in
molecular lines into a NLTE radiative transfer code. A two-step approach was
used. First, we separately solved the statistical equilibrium equations and
compute opacities and intensity while neglecting polariza- tion. Then we used
these quantities as input for calculating scattering polarization and the Hanle
effect. We have found that it is impossible to fit the intensity and
polarization simultaneously at different limb angles in the frame- work of
standard 1D modeling. The atmosphere models that provide correct intensity
center-to-limb variations fail to fit linear polar- ization center-to-limb
variations due to lacking radiation field anisotropy. We had to increase the
anisotropy by means of a specially introduced free parameter. This allows us to
successfully interpret our observations. We discuss possible reasons for
underestimating the anisotropy in the 1D modeling.
