relating the algebraic properties of these groups to physical properties of the
spacetimes. We then make group deformation local, generalising deformed special
relativity (DSR) by describing gravity as a gauge theory of the de Sitter
group. We find that in our construction Minkowski space has a connection with
torsion; physical effects of torsion seem to rule out the proposed framework as
a viable theory. A third chapter discusses a formulation of gravity as a
topological BF theory with added linear constraints that reduce the symmetries
of the topological theory to those of general relativity. We discretise our
constructions and compare to a similar construction by Plebanski which uses
quadratic constraints. In the second part we study CP violation in the
electroweak sector of the standard model and certain extensions of it. We
quantify fine-tuning in the observed magnitude of CP violation by determining a
natural measure on the space of CKM matrices, a double quotient of SU(3),
introducing different possible choices and comparing their predictions for CP
violation. While one generically faces a fine-tuning problem, in the standard
model the problem is removed by a measure that incorporates the observed quark
masses, which suggests a close relation between a mass hierarchy and
suppression of CP violation. Going beyond the standard model by adding a
left-right symmetry spoils the result, leaving us to conclude that such
additional symmetries appear less natural.

K-type star with ~0.6 M_sun. Its X-ray properties are in agreement with the
predictions for its age and mass. An excess of photons with respect to the
expected background and contribution from the nearby companion is observed near
the optical position of gamma Equu. We estimate an X-ray luminosity of log L_x

between the optical and the X-ray image leaves some doubt on its association

roAp star is difficult to explain as a solar-like stellar corona due to its
very low L_x/L_bol level and the very long rotation period of gamma Equu. It

whose space of solutions contains certain class of AdS-waves, including in
particular Schrodinger invariant spacetimes. This amounts to consider higher
order theories, and the natural case to start with is to analyze generic
square-curvature corrections to Einstein-Hilbert action. In this case, the
Schrodinger invariant sector in the space of solutions arises for a special
relation between the coupling constants appearing in the action. On the other
hand, besides the Schrodinger invariant configurations, logarithmic branches
similar to those of the so-called Log-gravity are also shown to emerge for
another special choice of the coupling constants. These Log solutions can be
interpreted as the superposition of the massless mode of General Relativity and
two scalar modes that saturate the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound (BF) of the AdS
space on which they propagate. These solutions are higher-dimensional analogues
of those appearing in three-dimensional massive gravities with relaxed AdS_3
asymptotic. Other sectors of the space of solutions of higher-curvature
theories correspond to oscillatory configurations, which happen to be below the
BF bound. Also, there is a fully degenerated sector, for which any wave profile
is admitted. We comment on the relation between this degeneracy and the
non-renormalization of the dynamical exponent of the Schrodinger spaces. Our
analysis also includes more general gravitational actions with non-polynomial
corrections consisting of arbitrary functions of the square-curvature
invariants. The same sectors of solutions are shown to exist for this more
general family of theories. We finally consider the Chern-Simons modified

2MASS data archives, these include 32 normal elliptical galaxies, 10
ellipticals with weak Liner or other nuclear activity, and 10 star forming
ellipticals or early-type spirals. We examine the spatial distribution of the
Far Ultra-Violet excess in these galaxies, and its correlation with dynamical
and stellar population properties of the galaxies. From aperture photometry we
find that all galaxies except for recent major remnants and galaxies with
ongoing star formation show a positive gradient in the (FUV-NUV) colour
determined from the GALEX images. The logarithmic gradient does not correlate
with any stellar population parameter, but it does correlate with the central
velocity dispersion. The strength of the excess on the other hand, correlates
with both [alpha/Fe] and [Z/H], but more strongly with the former. We derive
models of the underlying stellar population from the 2MASS H-band images, and
the residual of the image from this model reveals a map of the centrally
concentrated FUV excess. We examine a possible hypothesis for generating the
FUV excess and the radial gradient in its strength, involving a helium
abundance gradient set up early in the formation process of the galaxies. If
this hypothesis is correct, the persistence of the gradients to the present day
places a strong limit on the importance of dry mergers in the formation of
ellipticals.

Those bursts that were detected by the LAT were among the brightest GBM bursts.
We examine a sample of the most luminous GBM bursts with no LAT detection and

average upper limit ratio of 0.45 for GeV fluence during the first 600 seconds

in particular rule out SSC models for the prompt emission. In about a third of
both LAT detected and LAT non-detected bursts, we find that the extrapolation
of the MeV range Band spectrum to the GeV range is larger than the observed GeV

any specific burst, the overall excess in a large fraction of the bursts
suggests a decline in the high energy spectral slope in at least some of these

the collapse changes from isothermal to adiabatic at earlier times that occurs
for the models with a lower critical density, the collapse is slowed down, and
this enhances the fragments' change to survive. However, this effect happens up
to a threshold density below which single systems tend to form. On the other
hand, by setting a bigger initial perturbation amplitude, the collapse is
faster and in some cases a final single object is formed.

numerous less-evolved giant stars that continue to increase in luminosity. In
this second paper of the series, we construct the birth mass function and hence
derive the star formation history. The star formation rate has varied between
~0.002 and 0.007 M$_\odot$ yr^-1 kpc^-2. We give evidence of two epochs of a
star formation rate enhanced by a factor of a few -- one that happened \geq 6
Gyr ago and produced \geq 80% of the total mass in stars, and one around 250
Myr ago that lasted ~ 200 Myr and formed \leq 6% of the mass in stars. We
construct radial and azimuthal distributions in the image plane and in the
galaxy plane for populations associated with old first-ascent red giant branch
(RGB) stars, intermediate-age Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and young
(massive) blue and red supergiants. We find that the RGB stars follow a
spheroidal distribution, while younger stars follow a flat-disc distribution.
The intermediate-age population displays signs of a pseudo-bulge or possibly a
bar. The inner spiral arm pattern as recorded in mid-19^th-century drawings is
confirmed. We interpret our findings as evidence for an old, pressure-supported
component and a younger disc formed 6 Gyr ago, with an accretion event
occurring 250 Myr ago giving rise to the compact nucleus in M33. Our study
provides support for recent Padova stellar evolution models except that
super-AGB stars likely reach low temperatures and thus high mass-loss rates,

abundances that correlate with the condensation temperature (T_c) of the

trends have been interpreted as evidence that the stars may have accreted
H-depleted planetary material. Our newly derived abundances also correlate
positively with T_c, although slopes of linear least-square fits to the

studies. When considering the refractory elements (T_c > 900 K) only, which may
be more sensitive to planet formation processes, the sample can be separated
into a group with positive slopes (four stars) and a group with flat or
negative slopes (six stars). The four stars with positive slopes have very
close-in giant planets (three at 0.05 AU) and slopes that fall above the
general Galactic chemical evolution trend. We suggest that these stars have
accreted refractory-rich planet material but not to the extent that would

malicious behavior on the part of users seeking to deny service to others or
maximize their own resource usage.
  Recently, publically available cloud computing services such as Amazon EC2
have used virtualization to provide customers with virtual machines running on
the provider's hardware, typically charging by wall clock time rather than
resources consumed. Under this business model, manipulation of the scheduler
may allow theft of service at the expense of other customers, rather than
merely reallocating resources within the same administrative domain.
  We describe a flaw in the Xen scheduler allowing virtual machines to consume
almost all CPU time, in preference to other users, and demonstrate kernel-based
and user-space versions of the attack. We show results demonstrating the
vulnerability in the lab, consuming as much as 98% of CPU time regardless of
fair share, as well as on Amazon EC2, where Xen modifications protect other
users but still allow theft of service. In case of EC2, following the
responsible disclosure model, we have reported this vulnerability to Amazon;
they have since implemented a fix that we have tested and verified (See

above 470 GeV of 1.3 +- 0.2 (stat) +- 0.3 (sys) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}.
There is no Fermi/LAT counterpart down to a flux limit of 6 x 10^{-9} cm^{-2}

H.E.S.S., Fermi/LAT and Nancay Radio Telescope observations with pre-existing
non-simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of IGR J19443+2117 and discuss
the likely source associations as well as the interpretation as an active
galactic nucleus, a gamma-ray binary or a pulsar wind nebula. The lack of a
massive stellar counterpart disfavors the binary hypothesis, while the soft VHE
spectrum would be very unusual in case of a pulsar wind nebula. In addition,
the distance estimates for Galactic counterparts places them outside of the
Milky Way. All available observations favor an interpretation as an extreme,
high-frequency peaked BL Lac object with a redshift z>0.14. This would be the
first time a blazar is detected serendipitously from ground-based VHE

apply the results in the analysis of noise thresholds in quantum key
distribution protocols with two-way postprocessing.
  We find that states that admit a symmetric extension can be decomposed into a
convex combination of states that admit a_pure_ symmetric extension. For a
state to have a pure symmetric extension, its nonzero eigenvalues must be equal
to the nonzero eigenvalues of one of the subsystems. While this does not fully
characterize the set of states with a pure symmetric extension in all
dimensions, it is a full characterization for two qubits. A conjectured formula
characterizing two-qubit states with a (mixed or pure) symmetric extension is
presented. Proofs are given for some special classes. For multi-qubit
Bell-diagonal states, the symmetric extension is simplified using the
symmetries of the states and formulated as a semidefinite program.
  Quantum key distribution with two-way advantage distillation steps is then
analyzed. For the commonly used repetition code advantage distillation, the
failure to distill a secret key beyond the currently known noise thresholds is
explained by a failure to break a symmetric extension. More general linear
advantage distillation schemes are analyzed, but for those schemes analyzed, we
find that they tolerate strictly less noise than repetition code advantage
distillation before they fail to break a symmetric extension. The results
suggest that no other linear advantage distillation scheme can reach the noise
threshold of 27.6 % for the six-state protocol which is achieved by repetition
code advantage distillation.

A strong electron-impurity coupling breaks down equality of the two

between different spin singlets. As a result, the maximally entangled qubit

containing junctions which give rise to a proliferation of the number of sharp

system identification and inference tasks. Exciting applications ranging from
neuroscience to genome-wide association analysis build on these models with the
additional requirement of parsimony. This requirement has high interpretative
value, but unfortunately cannot be met by least-squares based or kernel
regression methods. To this end, compressed sampling (CS) approaches, already
successful in linear regression settings, can offer a viable alternative. The
viability of CS for sparse Volterra and polynomial models is the core theme of
this work. A common sparse regression task is initially posed for the two
models. Building on (weighted) Lasso-based schemes, an adaptive RLS-type
algorithm is developed for sparse polynomial regressions. The identifiability
of polynomial models is critically challenged by dimensionality. However,
following the CS principle, when these models are sparse, they could be
recovered by far fewer measurements. To quantify the sufficient number of
measurements for a given level of sparsity, restricted isometry properties
(RIP) are investigated in commonly met polynomial regression settings,
generalizing known results for their linear counterparts. The merits of the
novel (weighted) adaptive CS algorithms to sparse polynomial modeling are
verified through synthetic as well as real data tests for genotype-phenotype
analysis.

present in RV curves measured during planetary transits. This signal is induced
by the convective blueshift (CB) effect --- a net blueshift emanating from the
stellar surface, resulting from a larger contribution of rising hot and bright
gas relative to the colder and darker sinking gas. Since the CB radial
component varies across the stellar surface, the light blocked by the planet
during a transit will have a varying RV component, resulting in a small shift
of the measured RVs. The CB-induced anomalous RV curve is different than, and
independent of, the well known Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, where the
latter is used for determining the sky-projected angle between the host star
rotation axis and the planet's orbital angular momentum axis. The observed RV
curve is the sum of the CB and RM signals, and they are both superposed on the
orbital Keplerian curve. If not accounted for, the presence of the CB RV signal
in the spectroscopic transit RV curve may bias the estimate of the spin-orbit
angle. In addition, future very high precision RVs will allow the use of

these contributions using the high-resolution Millennium-II simulation. We use
upper limits on the contributions of unknown sources to the EBL to constrain
the intrinsic properties of dark matter using a model-independent approach that
can be employed as a template to test different particle physics models
(including those with a Sommerfeld enhancement). These upper limits are based
on observations spanning eight orders of magnitude in energy (from soft X-rays
measured by CHANDRA to gamma-rays measured by Fermi), and on expectations for
the contributions from blazars and star forming galaxies. To exemplify this
approach, we analyze a set of benchmark Sommerfeld-enhanced models that give
the correct dark matter abundance, satisfy CMB constraints, and fit the cosmic
ray spectra measured by PAMELA and Fermi without any contribution from local
subhalos. We find that these models are in conflict with the EBL constraints
unless the contribution of unresolved subhalos is small and the annihilation
signal dominates the EBL. We conclude that provided the collisionless cold dark
matter paradigm is accurate, even for conservative estimates of the
contribution from unresolved subhalos and astrophysical backgrounds, the EBL is
at least as sensitive a probe of these types of scenarios as the CMB. Our
results disfavor an explanation of the positron excess measured by PAMELA based
only on dark matter annihilation in the smooth Galactic halo.

two Chandra pointings in Cyg OB2, detecting ~1700 X-ray sources, of which ~1450
are thought to be members of the association. Optical and near-IR photometry
has been obtained for ~90% of these sources from recent deep Galactic plane
surveys. We have performed isochrone fits to the near-IR color-magnitude
diagram, deriving ages of 3.5(+0.75,-1.0) and 5.25(+1.5,-1.0) Myrs for sources
in the two fields, both with considerable spreads around the pre-MS isochrones.
The presence of a second population in the region, somewhat older than the
present-day O-type stars, has been suggested by other authors and fits with the
ages derived here. The fraction of sources with inner circumstellar disks (as
traced by the K-band excess) is found to be very low, but appropriate for a
population of age ~5 Myrs. We measure the stellar mass functions and find a
power-law slope of Gamma = -1.09 +/- 0.13, in good agreement with the global
mean value estimated by Kroupa. A steepening of the mass function at high
masses is observed and we suggest this is due to the presence of the previous
generation of stars that have lost their most massive members. Finally,
combining our mass function and an estimate of the radial density profile of
the association suggests a total mass of Cyg OB2 of ~30,000 Msun, similar to
that of many of our Galaxy's most massive star forming regions.

~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (M_g ~ -21
mag) transient source found by the Palomar Transient Factory. The
ultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by a
blackbody with T ~ 1-2 x 10^4 K and peak bolometric luminosity L_BB ~ 1-5 x
10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). A
comparable amount of energy is radiated in the X-ray band that appears to
result from a distinct physical process. The location of PTF10iya is consistent
with the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within
350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than
1.2 kpc. At first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of the
characteristic ""big blue bump"" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of many
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, emission-line diagnostics of the host
galaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show no
evidence for AGN-like activity. We therefore consider whether the tidal
disruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole may
account for our observations. Though with limited temporal information,
PTF10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early
""super-Eddington"" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 M_sun black
hole. Regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, the
large luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxies
can transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the Eddington limit; many such
outbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

the excess changes by a factor of 8 on weekly timescales, and the 3.6 and
4.5micron photometry shows a drop of 0.35 magnitudes in one week followed by a
slow 0.5 magnitude increase over the next three weeks. The accretion rate, as
measured by PaBeta and BrGamma emission lines, varies by a factor of five with
evidence for a correlation between the accretion rate and the infrared excess.
While the gas and dust in the inner disk are fluctuating the central star stays
relatively static. Our observations allow us to put constraints on the physical
mechanism responsible for the variability. The variabile accretion, and wind,
are unlikely to be causes of the variability, but both are effects of the same
physical process that disturbs the disk. The lack of periodicity in our
infrared monitoring indicates that it is unlikely that there is a companion

either a companion beyond ~0.4 AU or a dynamic interface between the stellar

assortative mixing in online networks at the level of SWB. Our results imply
that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms
that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative
mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of
online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels
of SWB may be an important instrument in better understanding how both positive

obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory over a period of roughly 2 years
are presented. The orbit of systems A (O9.7 I+b2 v, PA = 21 d) and B (O8 III+o9
v, PB = 6 d) are reasonably well sampled by the observations, allowing the
origin of the X-ray emission to be examined in detail. The X-ray spectra can be
well fitted by an attenuated three temperature thermal plasma model,
characterised by cool, moderate, and hot plasma components at kT ~ 0.2, 0.7,
and 2 keV, respectively, and a circumstellar absorption of ~ 0.2 x 10^22 cm-2.
Although the hot plasma component could be indicating the presence of wind-wind
collision shocks in the system, the model fluxes calculated from spectral fits,
with an average value of ~ 7 x 10^-13 erg s-1 cm-2, do not show a clear
correlation with the orbits of the two constituent binaries. A semi-analytical
model of QZ Car reveals that a stable momentum balance may not be established
in either system A or B. Yet, despite this, system B is expected to produce an
observed X-ray flux well in excess of the observations. If one considers the
wind of the O8 III star to be disrupted by mass transfer the model and
observations are in far better agreement, which lends support to the previous
suggestion of mass-transfer in the O8 III + o9 v binary. We conclude that the
X-ray emission from QZ Car can be reasonably well accounted for by a
combination of contributions mainly from the single stars and the mutual
wind-wind collision between systems A and B.

of decimation which is incorporated into the message update rule, involves
fixing certain bits of the code to a particular value. Under appropriately
chosen rules, decimation can significantly reduce the number of iterations
required to correct a fixed number of errors, while maintaining the good
performance of the original decoder in the error floor region. At the same
time, the algorithm is much more amenable to analysis. We shall provide a
simple decimation scheme for a particularly good 7-level FAID for column-weight
three codes on the BSC, that helps to correct a fixed number of errors in fewer
iterations, and provide insights into the analysis of the decoder. We shall
also examine the conditions under which the decimation-enhanced 7-level FAID
performs at least as good as the 7-level FAID.

10,000 stars from the full CCCP sample. The principal known clusters are
recovered, and some additional smaller groups are identified. No rich embedded
clusters are present, although a number of sparse groups are found. The CCCP
reveals considerable complexity in clustering properties. The Trumpler 14 and
15 clusters have rich stellar populations in unimodal, centrally concentrated
structures several parsecs across. Non-spherical internal structure is seen,
and large-scale low surface density distributions surround these rich clusters.
Trumpler 16, in contrast, is comprised of several smaller clusters within a
circular boundary. Collinder 228 is a third type of cluster which extends over
tens of parsecs with many sparse compact groups likely arising from triggered
star formation processes. A widely dispersed, but highly populous, distribution

Catalogue, and a compilation by Kronberg&Newton-McGee(2011), to infer the
global structure of the Galactic Magnetic Field (GMF). We have checked that
these two data sets are consistent with each other. Motivated by clear patterns
in the observed distribution of RMs over the sky, we considered GMF models
consisting of the two components: disk (spiral or ring) and halo. The
parameters of these components were determined by fitting different model field
geometries to the observed RMs. We found that the model consisting of a
symmetric (with respect to the Galactic plane) spiral disk and anti-symmetric
halo fits the data best, and reproduces the observed distribution of RMs over
the sky very well. We confirm that ring disk models are disfavored. Our results
favor small pitch angles around -5 degrees and an increased vertical scale of
electron distribution, in agreement with some previous studies. Based on our
fits, we identify two benchmark models suitable for studies of cosmic ray
propagation, including the ultra-high energies.

and P. Thieullen which analyze ergodic transport problems. Our main focus will
a more precise analysis of case where the maximizing probability is unique and
is also a periodic orbit.
  Consider the shift T acting on the Bernoulli space \Sigma={1, 2, 3,..,
d}^\mathbb{N} $ and $A:\Sigma \to \mathbb{R} a Holder potential.
  Denote m(A)=max_{\nu is an invariant probability for T} \int A(x) \; d\nu(x)
and, \mu_{\infty,A}, any probability which attains the maximum value. We assume
this probability is unique (a generic property). We denote \T the bilateral
shift. For a given potential Holder A:\Sigma \to \mathbb{R}, we say that a
Holder continuous function W: \hat{\Sigma} \to \mathbb{R} is a involution
kernel for A, if there is a Holder function A^*:\Sigma \to \mathbb{R}, such
that, A^*(w)= A\circ \T^{-1}(w,x)+ W \circ \T^{-1}(w,x) - W(w,x). We say that
A^* is a dual potential of A. It is true that m(A)=m(A^*). We denote by V the
calibrated subaction for A, and, V^* the one for A^*. We denote by I^* the
deviation function for the family of Gibbs states for \beta A, when \beta \to
\infty.
  For each x we get one (more than one) w_x such attains the supremum above.
That is, solutions of V(x) = W(w_x,x) - V^* (w_x)- I^*(w_x).
  A pair of the form (x,w_x) is called an optimal pair. If \T is the shift
acting on (x,w) \in {1, 2, 3,.., d}^\mathbb{Z}, then, the image by \T^{-1} of
an optimal pair is also an optimal pair.
  Theorem - Generically, in the set of Holder potentials A that satisfy
  (i) the twist condition,
  (ii) uniqueness of maximizing probability which is supported in a periodic
orbit, the set of possible optimal w_x, when x covers the all range of possible
elements x in \in \Sigma, is finite.

without revealing sensitive information about the individuals who contribute to
the data. The model of differential privacy allows such private release while
providing strong guarantees on the output. A basic mechanism achieves
differential privacy by adding noise to the frequency counts in the contingency
tables (or, a subset of the count data cube) derived from the dataset. However,
when the dataset is sparse in its underlying space, as is the case for most
multi-attribute relations, then the effect of adding noise is to vastly
increase the size of the published data: it implicitly creates a huge number of
dummy data points to mask the true data, making it almost impossible to work
with.
  We present techniques to overcome this roadblock and allow efficient private
release of sparse data, while maintaining the guarantees of differential
privacy. Our approach is to release a compact summary of the noisy data.
Generating the noisy data and then summarizing it would still be very costly,
so we show how to shortcut this step, and instead directly generate the summary
from the input data, without materializing the vast intermediate noisy data. We
instantiate this outline for a variety of sampling and filtering methods, and
show how to use the resulting summary for approximate, private, query
answering. Our experimental study shows that this is an effective, practical
solution, with comparable and occasionally improved utility over the costly
materialization approach.

passage time method shows that the presence of a weakly interacting seed has
little effect on the work of forming very small cluster embryos but accelerates
the rate by lowering the barrier for larger clusters. We suggest that this
results from a competition between the energetic and entropic features of
cluster formation in the bulk and at the heterogeneity. As the interaction is
increased, the free energy of formation is reduced for all cluster sizes. We
also develop a simple phenomenological model of film formation on a small seed
that captures the general features of the nucleation process for small
heterogeneities. A comparison of our simulation results with the model shows
that heterogeneous classical nucleation theory provides a good estimate of the
critical size of the film but significantly over-estimates the size of the

technologies trends the convergence of heterogeneous networks for the future
wireless communication system. To make a seamless handover among the
heterogeneous networks, the optimization of the power consumption, and optimal
selection of interface are the challenging issues for convergence networks. The
access of multi interfaces simultaneously reduces the handover latency and data
loss in heterogeneous handover. The mobile node (MN) maintains one interface
connection while other interface is used for handover process. However, it
causes much battery power consumption. In this paper we propose an efficient
interface selection scheme including interface selection algorithms, interface
selection procedures considering battery power consumption and user mobility
with other existing parameters for overlaying networks. We also propose a
priority based network selection scheme according to the service types. MN's
battery power level, provision of QoS/QoE in the target network and our
proposed priority parameters are considered as more important parameters for
our interface selection algorithm. The performances of the proposed scheme are
verified using numerical analysis.

corresponding stand-alone throughput scaling even without secondary spectrum
sensing (i.e., the sensing range set to zero); this implies the need for a more
comprehensive performance metric than just throughput scaling to evaluate the

originating from time-like dimensional reduction of supergravity from D=4 to
D=3 dimensions. The main result of our investigation is the construction of
three universal tensors, extracted from quadratic and quartic powers of the Lax
operator, that are capable of classifying both regular and nilpotent H* orbits
of Lax operators. Our tensor based classification is compared, in the case of
the simple one-field model S^3, to the algebraic classification of nilpotent
orbits and it is shown to provide a simple and practical discriminating method.
We present a detailed analysis of the S^3 model and its black hole solutions,

By means of the Kostant-representation of a generic Lie algebra element, we
were able to develop an algorithm which produces the necessary number of
hamiltonians in involution required by Liouville integrability of generic
orbits. The degenerate orbits correspond to extremal black-holes and are
nilpotent. We analyze these orbits in some detail working out different
representatives thereof and showing that the relation between H* orbits and
critical points of the geodesic potential is not one-to-one. Finally we present

monodomains grown by the top-seeded melt-textured technique. We measured the
field increase of the surface resistance $R_{\rm s}(H)$ in the a-b plane at
48.3 GHz. Measurements were performed at fixed temperatures in the range 70 K -
$T_{\rm c}$ with a static magnetic field $\mu_0H<0.8$ T parallel to the c-axis.
Low field steep increase of the dissipation, typical signature of the presence
of weak links, is absent, thus indicating the single-domain behaviour of the
sample under study. The magnetic field dependence of $R_{\rm s}(H)$ is ascribed
to the dissipation caused by vortex motion. The analysis of $X_{\rm s}(H)$
points to a free-flow regime, thus allowing to obtain the vortex viscosity as a
function of temperature. We compare the results with those obtained on RE-BCO
systems. In particular, we consider strongly pinned films of
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\rm\delta}$ with nanometric BaZrO$_3$ inclusions.

subject of controversy in the last two decades. (Pseudo)thermodynamic
determinations of $T_g$ generally suggest a significant depression, whereas the
molecular mobility is found to be unchanged. The present study clarifies this
apparent controversy by assuming that the $T_g$ in thin films is determined not
only by the molecular mobility but also by the thickness of the film. This
hypothesis is supported by the analysis of literature results on polystyrene
thin films showing that the $T_g$ dependence on the cooling rate obtained on
samples with different thicknesses can be rescaled onto a master curve. The
thickness dependence of $T_g$ is quantitatively captured by an equilibration
mechanism based on free volume holes diffusion. This dependence emerges from
the ability of thinner films to maintain equilibrium, due to the shorter
distance free volume holes have to diffuse to the polymer interface, the
molecular motion determining the diffusion coefficient being thickness
independent.

in the electric dipole response of all nuclei with strong neutron excess, the

measuring the cosmic evolution in molecular gas density and understanding the
star-formation history of the Universe. The 12CO molecule (J=1-0 transition =
115.27 GHz) is the best proxy for extragalactic H2, which is the gas reservoir
from which star formation occurs, and has been detected out to z~6. Typically,
redshifted high-J lines are observed at mm-wavelengths, the most commonly
targeted systems exhibiting high SFRs (e.g. submm galaxies), and far-IR-bright
QSOs. While the most luminous objects are the most readily observed, detections
of more typical galaxies with modest SFRs are essential for completing the
picture. ALMA will be revolutionary in terms of increasing the detection rate
and pushing the sensitivity limit down to include such galaxies, however the
limited FoV when observing at such high frequencies makes it difficult to use
ALMA for studies of the large-scale structure traced out by molecular gas in
galaxies. This article introduces a strategy for a systematic search for
molecular gas during the EoR (z~7 and above), capitalizing on the fact that the
J=1-0 transition of 12CO enters the upper bands of cm-wave instruments at
high-z. The FoV advantage gained by observing at such frequencies, coupled with
modern broadband correlators allows significant cosmological volumes to be
probed on reasonable timescales. In this article we present an overview of our
future observing programme which has been awarded 6,500 hours as one of the
Large Survey Projects for MeerKAT, the forthcoming South African SKA pathfinder
instrument. Its large FoV and correlator bandwidth, and high-sensitivity
provide unprecedented survey speed for such work. An existing astrophysical
simulation is coupled with instrumental considerations to demonstrate the
feasibility of such observations and predict detection rates.

conclude that a plausible explanation is that they correspond to a significant
(~30 %) extreme second generation with a strong helium enhancement (Y~0.4). We
also show that the color dispersion of the red giant branch is consistent with
this hypothesis, while the main sequence data are compatible with it, although
the large observational error blurs the possible underlying splitting. While it
is common to find an even larger (50 -- 80) percentage of second generation in
a globular cluster, the presence of a substantial and extreme fraction of these
stars in NGC 2419 might be surprising, as the cluster is at present well inside
the radius beyond which the galactic tidal field would be dominant. If a
similar situation had been present in the first stages of the cluster life, the
cluster would have retained its initial mass, and the percentage of second
generation stars should have been quite small (up to ~10 %). Such a large
fraction of extreme second generation stars implies that the system must have
been initially much more massive and in different dynamical conditions than
today. We discuss this issue in the light of existing models of the formation

  characteristics","Doctoral thesis from 2009, substantial content begins at p.10",,,,"physics.hist-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We begin by surveying the historical positions in different attempts to
understand the material world since the rise of modern science, with specific
focus on the role of Cartesian primary qualities in explanatory
conceptualisation. Moreover the opening chapter argues that although
explanatory narratives are essentially epistemological constructions, they
require a general metaphysical backing through the explainer's and explainee's
commitments to take the concepts and higher structures composed of them as
directly referential. Two methodological perspectives on theory construction,
Einstein's division into principle and constructive theories, are then
delineated along the lines of their metaphysical and explanatory potential, and
presented as the research instrument with which to approach the
specific-case-study instances of quantum theory reconstruction. A specific
strategy of arguing for scientific realism ('the simple transcendental
strategy') is then presented and connected to the challenges that the phenomena
(EPR correlations and 'teleportation') from the domain of contemporary quantum
theory pose for it. The opening chapter concludes with a survey of the general
models of explanation and their position with respect to the
principle-constructive dichotomy introduced above. Finally, an explanatory
model containing extended material-like entities along with further primitives,
universal laws of temporal evolution, is argued for. Consequently, in the
interest of a wholesome realistic response to the sceptical challenge about the
explanatory aims of science, we recommend that even the common sense conceptual
framework replaces the extended material structure with 'generalised things' as
re-identifiable invariants through change as the fundamental unit of the
realist ontology.

cycling leads to formation of a permanent state of lower resistance where the
lower resistance arises predominantly due to development of a shunt across the
device film (PCMO). On successive voltage cycling with increasing magnitude,
this state transforms into states of successive lower resistance that can be
transformed back to the initial stable state on cycling to below a certain
bias. A simple model based on p-n junction with shunt has been used to obtain
information on the change of the junction on voltage cycling. It has been shown
that the observation can be explained if the voltage cycling leads to lowering
of barrier at the interface and also reduction in series resistance. It is
suggested that this lowering can be related to the migration of oxygen ions and
vacancies at the junction region. Cross-sectional imaging of the junction shows
formation of permanent filamentary bridges across the thickness of the PCMO
after the pristine p-n junction is first taken through a voltage cycle, which
would explain appearance of a finite shunt across the p-n junction.

(Structural SVM) are two state-of-the-art methods for structured prediction
which captures the interdependencies among output variables. The success of
these methods is attributed to the fact that their discriminative models are
able to account for overlapping features on the whole input observations. These
features are usually generated by applying a given set of templates on labeled
data, but improper templates may lead to degraded performance. To alleviate
this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple template learning
paradigm to learn structured prediction and the importance of each template
simultaneously, so that hundreds of arbitrary templates could be added into the
learning model without caution. This paradigm can be formulated as a special
multiple kernel learning problem with exponential number of constraints. Then
we introduce an efficient cutting plane algorithm to solve this problem in the
primal, and its convergence is presented. We also evaluate the proposed
learning paradigm on two widely-studied structured prediction tasks,
\emph{i.e.} sequence labeling and dependency parsing. Extensive experimental
results show that the proposed method outperforms CRFs and Structural SVMs due
to exploiting the importance of each template. Our complexity analysis and
empirical results also show that our proposed method is more efficient than
OnlineMKL on very sparse and high-dimensional data. We further extend this
paradigm for structured prediction using generalized $p$-block norm
regularization with $p>1$, and experiments show competitive performances when
$p \in [1,2)$.

asymmetric jump distributions. The statistics of records in symmetric random
walks was previously analyzed by Majumdar and Ziff and is well understood.
Unlike the case of symmetric jump distributions, in the asymmetric case the
statistics of records depends on the choice of the jump distribution. We
compute the record rate $P_n(c)$, defined as the probability for the $n$th
value to be larger than all previous values, for a Gaussian jump distribution
with standard deviation $\sigma$ that is shifted by a constant drift $c$. For
small drift, in the sense of $c/\sigma \ll n^{-1/2}$, the correction to
$P_n(c)$ grows proportional to arctan$(\sqrt{n})$ and saturates at the value
$\frac{c}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}$. For large $n$ the record rate approaches a
constant, which is approximately given by
$1-(\sigma/\sqrt{2\pi}c)\textrm{exp}(-c^2/2\sigma^2)$ for $c/\sigma \gg 1$.
These asymptotic results carry over to other continuous jump distributions with
finite variance. As an application, we compare our analytical results to the
record statistics of 366 daily stock prices from the Standard & Poors 500
index. The biased random walk accounts quantitatively for the increase in the
number of upper records due to the overall trend in the stock prices, and after
detrending the number of upper records is in good agreement with the symmetric
random walk. However the number of lower records in the detrended data is
significantly reduced by a mechanism that remains to be identified.

galaxies suitable for providing absolute measures of the HI content of gaseous
objects. From a database of ~15,000 HI detections, we have assembled three
samples of gas-rich galaxies expected to show little or no evidence of
interaction with their surroundings that could provide adequate HI standards.
The most reliable results are obtained with a sample of 5647 sources found in
low density environments, as defined by a nearest neighbor approach. The other
two samples contain several hundred relatively isolated galaxies each, as
determined from standard isolation algorithms. We find that isolated objects
are not particularly gas-rich compared to their low-density-environment

range. All this makes them less suitable for defining a reference for HI
content. We have explored the optical morphology of gaseous galaxies in quiet

them display unequivocal late-type galaxy features. In contrast, bona fide
gas-rich early-type systems account only for a negligible fraction of the 21-cm
detections. We argue that HI emission provides the most reliable way to
determine the morphological population to which a galaxy belongs. We have also
observed that the color distribution of flux-limited samples of
optically-selected field HI emitters does not vary significantly with
increasing distance, while that of non-detections becomes notably redder. This
result suggests that the colors and HI masses of gas-rich galaxies cannot be
very closely related.

that coexistence of an infinite 1*cluster and an infinite 0cluster is almost

of both types in the absence of positive association. Namely, under a slightly
sharpened finite energy condition, the existence of infinitely many disjoint

1*cluster. The same holds with respect to 0paths and 0clusters.

differential equations (ODEs) has proven to be a powerful technique for
generating insight into cellular dynamics, but it typically requires estimating
rate parameters based on experimentally observed concentrations. New
measurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a
pathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate
parameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the
disagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method
fits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches
the derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each
species. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt
to match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the
ODEs. The new objective function is an extreme decomposition of the problem
because each factor in the function is enforcing the equality of one ODE at one
timeslice. A ""loopy belief propagation"" algorithm solves this factorized
approximation of the parameter estimation problem providing systematic coverage
of the search space and unique asymptotic behavior; the run time is polynomial
in the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the
biochemical network. The implementation is a global-local hybrid optimization,
and we compare with the performance of local, global, and hybrid methods. BPPE
is demonstrated for a novel model of Akt activation dynamics including
redox-mediated inactivation of PTEN. Availability: Software and supplementary

the synchrotron power and peak frequency remain constant with varying source

number density of electrons below the break energy: since this leads to an
increased electron-photon scattering efficiency, the resulting Compton power
increases, and so does the total (= synchrotron plus Compton) emission.

in competition with the intensively studied electro-hydrodynamic instability in

of many-valued logics with the introduction of higher-order Herbrand
interpretation types, where we explicitly introduce the coexistence of a set of
algebraic truth values of original many-valued logic, transformed as parameters
(or possible worlds), and the set of classic two logic values. This approach is
close to the approach used in annotated logics, but offers the possibility of
using the standard semantics based on Herbrand interpretations. Moreover, it
uses the properties of the higher-order Herbrand types, as their fundamental
nature is based on autoreferential Kripke semantics where the possible worlds
are algebraic truth-values of original many-valued logic. This autoreferential
Kripke semantics, which has the possibility of flattening higher-order Herbrand
interpretations into ordinary 2-valued Herbrand interpretations, gives us a
clearer insight into the relationship between many-valued and 2-valued
multi-modal logics. This methodology is applied to the class of many-valued
Logic Programs, where reduction is done in a structural way, based on the logic
structure (logic connectives) of original many-valued logics. Following this,
we generalize the reduction to general structural many-valued logics, in an
abstract way, based on Suszko's informal non-constructive idea. In all cases,
by using developed 2-valued reductions we obtain a kind of non truth-valued
modal meta-logics, where two-valued formulae are modal sentences obtained by

function. Percolation, the transition to extensive connectedness upon gradual
addition of links, was long believed to be continuous but recent numerical
evidence on ""explosive percolation"" suggests that it might as well be
discontinuous if links compete for addition. Here we analyze the microscopic
mechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong
impact of single link additions. We show that in generic competitive
percolation processes, including those displaying explosive percolation, single
links do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the
thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, our results highlight that for large finite
systems single links may still induce observable gaps because gap sizes scale
weakly algebraically with system size. Several essentially macroscopic clusters
coexist immediately before the transition, thus announcing discontinuous
percolation. These results explain how single links may drastically change
macroscopic connectivity in networks where links add competitively.

system of spherical colloidal particles with permanent dipole moments in a
rotating magnetic field. Performing simulations at a fixed packing fraction and
dipole coupling parameter, we construct a full non-equilibrium phase diagram as
function of the driving frequency ($\omega_0$) and field strength ($B_0$). This
diagram contains both synchronized states, where the individual particles
follow the field with (on average) constant phase difference, and asynchronous
states. The synchronization is accompanied by layer formation, i.e. by spatial
symmetry-breaking, similar to systems of induced dipoles in rotating fields. In
the permanent-dipole case, however, too large $\omega_0$ yield a breakdown of
layering, supplemented by complex changes of the single-particle rotational
dynamics from synchronous to asynchronous behavior. We show that the limit
frequencies $\omega_c$ can be well described as a bifurcation in the nonlinear
equation of motion of a single particle rotating in a viscous medium. Finally,
we present a simple density functional theory, which describes the emergence of
layers in perfectly synchronized states as an equilibrium phase transition.

well described by Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and second-RPA calculations

characteristic scales are already present at the mean-field level pointing to
their origination in Landau damping, in contrast to the findings in heavier

effective interactions, where fine structure is explained by the coupling to
two-particle two-hole (2p-2h) states.

capable of simulating the intrinsic bosonic Josephson effect with photons, and
second to study various outcomes deriving from inherent or external
decoherence. A qubit induces an effective coupling between two externally
pumped cavity modes. Without cavity losses and in the dispersive regime,
intrinsic Josephson oscillations of photons between the two modes occurs. In
this case, contrary to regular Markovian decoherence, the qubit purity shows a
Gaussian decay and recurrence of its coherence. Due to intrinsic
non-linearities, both the Josephson oscillations as well as the qubit
properties display a rich collapse-revival structure, where, however, the
complexity of the qubit evolution is in some sense stronger. The qubit as a
meter of the photon dynamics is considered, and it is shown that qubit
dephasing, originating for example from non-demolition measurements, results in
an exponential destruction of the oscillations which manifests the
collectiveness of the Josephson effect. Non-selective qubit measurements, on
the other hand, render a Zeno effect seen in a slowing down of the Josephson
oscillations. Contrary to dephasing, cavity dissipation results in a Gaussian
decay of the scaled Josephson oscillations. Finally, following Ponomarev et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 010405 (2011)] we analyze aspects of thermalization. In
particular, despite similarities with the generic model studied by Ponomarev
{\it et al.}, our system does not seem to thermalize.
