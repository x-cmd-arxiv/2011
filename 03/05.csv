factor integrals $f^{(n)}_{N,N}(t)$ for the correlation functions of the Ising
model on the diagonal in terms of the hypergeometric functions
$_2F_1([1/2,N+1/2];[N+1];t)$ which appear in the form factor
$f^{(1)}_{N,N}(t)$. New quadratic recursion and quartic identities are obtained
for the form factors for n=2,3. For n= 2,3,4 explicit results are given for the
form factors. These factorizations are proved for all N for n= 2,3. These
results yield the emergence of palindromic polynomials canonically associated
with elliptic curves. As a consequence, understanding the form factors amounts
to describing and understanding an infinite set of palindromic polynomials,
canonically associated with elliptic curves. From an analytical viewpoint the
relation of these palindromic polynomials with hypergeometric functions
associated with elliptic curves is made very explicitly, and from a
differential algebra viewpoint this corresponds to the emergence of direct sums
of differential operators homomorphic to symmetric powers of a second order
operator associated with elliptic curve.

are an useful method used to classify PDE in class of equivalence. In this
paper we consider a large class of U(1)-invariant nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equations containing complex nonlinearities. The U(1) symmetry implies the
existence of a continuity equation for the particle density
$\rho\equiv|\psi|^2$ where the current ${\bfm j}_{_\psi}$ has, in general, a
nonlinear structure. We introduce a nonlinear gauge transformation on the
dependent variables $\rho$ and ${\bfm j}_{\psi}$ which changes the evolution
equation in another one containing only a real nonlinearity and transforms the
particle current ${\bfm j}_{_\psi}$ in the standard bilinear form. We extend
the method to U(1)-invariant coupled nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations where
the most general nonlinearity is taken into account through the sum of an
Hermitian matrix and an anti-Hermitian matrix. By means of the nonlinear gauge
transformation we change the nonlinear system in another one containing only a
purely Hermitian nonlinearity. Finally, we consider nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equations minimally coupled with an Abelian gauge field whose dynamics is
governed, in the most general fashion, through the Maxwell-Chern-Simons
equation. It is shown that the nonlinear transformation we are introducing can
be applied, in this case, separately to the gauge field or to the matter field
with the same final result. In conclusion, some relevant examples are presented
to show the applicability of the method.

provide information about the physical state and merger and accretion histories
of the systems. One way that black hole spin may be estimated is through
observations of extended radio sources. These sources, powered by outflows from
an AGN, allow the beam power and total outflow energy to be studied. In a broad
class of models, the beam power of the outflow is related to the spin of the
black hole. This relationship is used to estimate black hole spins for 55 radio
sources. The samples studied include 7 FRII quasars and 19 FRII radio galaxies
with redshifts between 0.056 and 1.79, and 29 radio sources associated with CD
galaxies with redshifts between 0.0035 and 0.291. The FRII sources studied have
estimated spin values of between about 0.2 and 1; there is a range of values at
a given redshift, and the values tend to increase with increasing redshift.
Results obtained for FRII quasars are very similar to those obtained for FRII
galaxies. A broader range of spin values are obtained for the sample of radio
sources associated with CD galaxies studied. The fraction of the spin energy
extracted per outflow event is estimated and ranges from about 0.03 to 0.5 for
FRII sources and 0.002 to about 1 for radio sources associated with CD
galaxies; the data are consistent with this fraction being independent of
redshift though the uncertainties are large. The results obtained are
consistent with those predicted by numerical simulations that track the merger
and accretion history of AGN, supporting the idea that, for AGN with powerful
large-scale outflows, beam power is directly related to black hole spin.

This paper argues that the field of online algorithms and competitive analysis
provides useful tools to deal with and reason about the uncertainty in the
request dynamics, and to design algorithms with provable performance
guarantees. As a case study, we describe a system (e.g., a gaming application)
where network virtualization is used to support thin client applications for
mobile devices to improve their QoS. By decoupling the service from the
underlying resource infrastructure, it can be migrated closer to the current
client locations while taking into account migration cost. This paper
identifies the major cost factors in such a system, and formalizes the
corresponding optimization problem. Both randomized and deterministic, gravity
center based online algorithms are presented which achieve a good tradeoff
between improved QoS and migration cost in the worst-case, both for service
migration within an infrastructure provider as well as for networks supporting
cross-provider migration. The paper reports on our simulation results and also
presents an explicit construction of an optimal offline algorithm which allows,

observed, even at dopings as low as 1%. We show that this behavior is
consistent with the resonating valence bond spin-liquid model proposed by Yang,
Rice, and Zhang. In this model, the overall reduction in optical conductivity
in the approach to the Mott insulating state is caused not by an increase in
effective mass, but by a Gutzwiller factor, which describes decreased coherence
due to correlations, and by a shrinking of the Fermi surface, which decreases
the number of available charge carriers. We also show that in this model, the
pseudogap does not modify the low-temperature, low-frequency behavior, though
the magnitude of the conductivity is greatly reduced by the Gutzwiller factor.
Similarly, the profile of the temperature dependence of the microwave
conductivity is largely unchanged in shape, but the Gutzwiller factor is
essential in understanding the observed difference in magnitude between ortho-I

investigate the frequency and properties of substellar objects with masses down
to a few times that of Jupiter in nearby star-forming regions. In this third
paper, we present our recent results in the Chamaeleon-I star forming region.
We have carried out deep optical and near-infrared imaging in four bands (I, z,
J, Ks) using VIMOS on the ESO Very Large Telescope and SOFI on the New
Technology Telescope, and combined our data with mid-infrared data from the
Spitzer Space Telescope. The survey covers ~0.25 sqdeg on the sky, and reaches
completeness limits of 23.0 in the I-band, 18.3 in the J-band, and 16.7 in
Ks-band. Follow-up spectroscopy of the candidates selected from the optical
photometry (I <~ 21) was carried out using the multi-object spectrograph VIMOS
on the VLT. We identify 13 objects consistent with M spectral types, 11 of
which are previously known M-dwarfs with confirmed membership in the cluster.
The 2 newly reported objects have effective temperatures above the substellar
limit. We also present two new candidate members of Chamaeleon-I, selected from
our JK photometry combined with the Spitzer data. Based on the results of our
survey, we estimate that the number of missing very-low-mass members down to
~0.008 MSun and Av <= 5 is <= 7, i.e. <= 3% of the total cluster population
according to the current census.

is semiconducting with the particularity that the resistivity drops by about 5
orders of magnitude on cooling through $T_C$, which is therefore called a
metal-insulator transition. In this paper we study the magnetization, specific
heat, thermal expansion, and the resistivity around this ferromagnetic
transition on high-quality EuC$_2$ samples. At $T_C$ we observe well defined
anomalies in the specific heat $c_p(T)$ and thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$ data.
The magnetic contributions of $c_p(T)$ and $\alpha(T)$ can satisfactorily be
described within a mean-field theory, taking into account the magnetization
data. In zero magnetic field the magnetic contributions of the specific heat
and thermal expansion fulfill a Gr\""uneisen-scaling, which is not preserved in
finite fields. From an estimation of the pressure dependence of $T_C$ via
Ehrenfest's relation, we expect a considerable increase of $T_C$ under applied
pressure due to a strong spin-lattice coupling. Furthermore the influence of
weak off stoichiometries $\delta$ in EuC$_{2 \pm \delta}$ was studied. It is
found that $\delta$ strongly affects the resistivity, but hardly changes the
transition temperature. In all these aspects, the behavior of EuC$_2$ strongly
resembles that of EuO.

equivalent to Brans-Dicke (BD) scalar-tensor gravity without a kinetic term.

that metric f(R) gravity admits a well-posed initial value problem. However, it

during the last years, and are now exceeding the one-ton scale. The required
high xenon purity is usually achieved by continuous recirculation of xenon gas
through a high-temperature getter. This challenges the traditional way of
cooling these large detectors, since in a thermally well insulated detector,
most of the cooling power is spent to compensate losses from recirculation. The
phase change during recondensing requires five times more cooling power than
cooling the gas from ambient temperature to -100C (173 K). Thus, to reduce the
cooling power requirements for large detectors, we propose to use the heat from
the purified incoming gas to evaporate the outgoing xenon gas, by means of a
heat exchanger. Generally, a heat exchanger would appear to be only of very
limited use, since evaporation and liquefaction occur at zero temperature
difference. However, the use of a recirculation pump reduces the pressure of
the extracted liquid, forces it to evaporate, and thus cools it down. We show
that this temperature difference can be used for an efficient heat exchange
process. We investigate the use of a commercial parallel plate heat exchanger
with a small liquid xenon detector. Although we expected to be limited by the
available cooling power to flow rates of about 2 SLPM, rates in excess of 12
SLPM can easily be sustained, limited only by the pump speed and the impedance
of the flow loop. The heat exchanger operates with an efficiency of (96.8 +/-
0.5)%. This opens the possibility for fast xenon gas recirculation in
large-scale experiments, while minimizing thermal losses.

the draining algorithm as compared to a random assignment can be as much as 2%
for the first tiles. This would imply for a survey like BigBOSS saving for
observation several hundred thousand objects or, alternatively, reducing the
covered area in ~350 sq. deg. An important advantage of this method is that the
fiber collision problem can be solved easily and in an optimal way. We also
discuss additional optimizations of the fiber positioning process. In
particular, we show that allowing for rotation of the focal plane can improve
the efficiency of the process in ~3.5-4.5% even if only small adjustments are
permitted (up to 2 deg). For instruments that allow large rotations of the
focal plane the expected gain increases to ~5-6%. These results, therefore,
strongly support focal plane rotation in future spectrographs, as far as the

intrinsic parameters that best define their HI content; and iii) explore the
scaling relations arising from the joint distributions of the quantities most
strongly correlated with the HI mass. The principal component analysis
performed over a set of five galaxy properties reveals that they are strongly
interrelated, supporting previous claims that nearby HI emitters show a high
degree of correlation. The best predictors for the expected value of MHI are
the diameter of the stellar disk, D25r, followed by the total luminosity (both
in the r-band), and the maximum rotation speed, while morphological proxies
such as color show only a moderately strong correlation with the gaseous
content attenuated by observational error. The simplest and most accurate
prescription is log(MHI/Msun)= 8.72 + 1.25*log(D25r/kpc). We find a slope of
$-8.2 \pm 0.5$ for the relation between optical magnitude and log rotation
speed, in good agreement with Tully-Fisher studies, and a log slope of $1.55

  (removed figures that were mistakenly included at the end of the document)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The capacity of multiuser networks has been a long-standing problem in
information theory. Recently, Avestimehr et al. have proposed a deterministic
network model to approximate multiuser wireless networks. This model, known as
the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of wireless
medium and interference.
  We show that the ADT network model can be described within the algebraic
network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove that the
ADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, and show that the
min-cut of an ADT network is the rank of this matrix; thus, eliminating the
need to optimize over exponential number of cuts between two nodes to compute
the min-cut of an ADT network. We extend the capacity characterization for ADT
networks to a more general set of connections, including single
unicast/multicast connection and non-multicast connections such as multiple
multicast, disjoint multicast, and two-level multicast. We also provide
sufficiency conditions for achievability in ADT networks for any general
connection set. In addition, we show that random linear network coding, a
randomized distributed algorithm for network code construction, achieves the
capacity for the connections listed above. Furthermore, we extend the ADT
networks to those with random erasures and cycles (thus, allowing
bi-directional links).
  In addition, we propose an efficient linear code construction for the
deterministic wireless multicast relay network model. Avestimehr et al.'s
proposed code construction is not guaranteed to be efficient and may
potentially involve an infinite block length. Unlike several previous coding
schemes, we do not attempt to find flows in the network. Instead, for a layered
network, we maintain an invariant where it is required that at each stage of
the code construction, certain sets of codewords are linearly independent.

previously conducted for handfuls of M15 red giant branch (RGB) and red
horizontal branch (RHB) stars. No attempt has been made to perform a single,
self-consistent analysis of these stars, which exhibit a wide range in
atmospheric parameters. In the current effort, a new comparative abundance
derivation is presented for three RGB and six RHB members of the cluster. The
analysis employs an updated version of the line transfer code MOOG, which now
appropriately treats coherent, isotropic scattering. The apparent discrepancy
in the previously reported values for the metallicity of M15 RGB and RHB stars
is addressed and a resolute disparity of $\Delta(RHB-RGB) \approx 0.1$ dex in
the iron abundance was found. The anti-correlative behavior of the light
neutron capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr) is clearly demonstrated with both Ba and
Eu, standard markers of the {\it s}- and {\it r}-process, respectively. No
conclusive detection of Pb was made in the RGB targets. Consequently for the
M15 cluster, this suggests that the main component of the {\it s}-process has
made a negligible contribution to those elements normally dominated by this
process in solar system material. Additionally for the M15 sample, a large Eu
abundance spread is confirmed, which is comparable to that of the halo field at
the same metallicity. These abundance results are considered in the discussion
of the chemical inhomogeneity and nucleosynthetic history of M15.

paper, following a recently proposed GUP which is consistent with quantum
gravity theories, we study the quantum mechanical systems in the presence of
both a minimum length and a maximum momentum. The generalized Hamiltonian
contains two additional terms which are proportional to $\alpha p^3$ and
$\alpha^2 p^4$ where $\alpha \sim 1/M_{Pl}c$ is the GUP parameter. For the case

are now known in closed form. At loop level, it determines the functional form

place. The two species are always disentangled if the interspecies spin
coupling is ferromagnetic or zero. Quantum phase transitions occur when the
interspecies spin coupling varies between antiferromagtic and zero or
ferromagnetic while the two intraspecies spin couplings both remain
ferromagnetic. On the other hand, by tuning the interspecies spin coupling from
zero to antiferromagnetic and then back to zero, one can circumvent the quantum
phase transition due to sign change of the intraspecies spin coupling of a

the advantages of Bayesian model selection. We will argue that the difference
between inference and design is that in the former we try to reconstruct the
system that has given rise to the data that we observe, while in the latter, we
seek to construct the system that produces the data that we would like to
observe, i.e. the desired behavior. Our approach allows us to exploit methods
from Bayesian statistics, including efficient exploration of models spaces and
high-dimensional parameter spaces, and the ability to rank models with respect
to their ability to generate certain types of data. Bayesian model selection
furthermore automatically strikes a balance between complexity and (predictive
or explanatory) performance of mathematical models. In order to deal with the
complexities of molecular systems we employ an approximate Bayesian computation
scheme which only requires us to simulate from different competing models in
order to arrive at rational criteria for choosing between them. We illustrate
the advantages resulting from combining the design and modeling (or in-silico
prototyping) stages currently seen as separate in synthetic biology by
reference to deterministic and stochastic model systems exhibiting adaptive and
switch-like behavior, as well as bacterial two-component signaling systems.

a five-band tight-binding model derived from fitting the LDA band structure, we
find that the orbital magnetic susceptibility of the conduction electrons in
such a multi-orbital system is several times larger than the Pauli spin
susceptibility and is comparable in magnitude to the observed total magnetic
susceptibility. The orbital magnetic susceptibility in the Fe-As
plane($\chi^{x}_{L}$) is found to be larger than that perpendicular to the
Fe-As plane($\chi^{z}_{L}$) by a factor about two and the total magnetic
susceptibility in the normal state can be fitted with formula
$\chi(T,\theta)\approx \chi_{s}(T)+\chi_{L}(\theta)$, where $\chi_{s}(T)$ is
the temperature dependent isotropic part due to spin and $\chi_{L}(\theta)$ is
the temperature independent anisotropic part due to orbital. In the
superconducting state, $\chi^{x}_{L}$ is found to be significantly reduced as
the pairing gap develops, while $\chi^{z}_{L}$ is almost not affected by the
superconducting transition. We argue the large anisotropy observed in the bulk
magnetic susceptibility and the Knight shift in the Iron-based superconductors

intergalactic medium (IGM) on the baryon fraction distribution. In the fully
developed nonlinear regime, the IGM will evolve into the state of turbulence,
containing strong and curved shocks, vorticity and complex structures.
Turbulence would lead to the density and velocity fields of the IGM to be
different from those of underlying collisionless dark matter. Consequently, the
baryon fraction f_b will deviate from its cosmic mean . We study these
phenomena with simulation samples produced by the weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) hybrid cosmological hydrodynamic/N-body code, which is
effective of capturing shocks and complex structures. We find that the
distribution of baryon fraction is highly nonuniform on scales from hundreds
kpc to a few of Mpc, and f_b varies from as low as 1% to a few times of the
cosmic mean. We further show that the turbulence pressure in the IGM is weakly
scale-dependent and comparable to the gravitational energy density of halos
with mass around 10^11 h-1 M\odot . The baryon fraction in halos with mass
equal to or smaller than 10^11 h^-1 M\odot should be substantially lower than
f_b^cosmic. Numerical results show that f_b is decreasing from 0.8 f_b^cosmic
at halo mass scales around 10^12 h^-1 M\odot to 0.3f_b^cosmic at 10^11 h^-1
M\odot and shows further decrease when halo mass is less than 10^11 h^-1
M\odot. The strong mass dependence of f_b is similar to the observed results.
  Although the simulated f_b in halos are higher than the observed value by a
factor of 2, the turbulence of the
  IGM should be an important dynamical reason leading to the remarkable missing
of baryonic matter in halos with mass \leq 10^12 h^-1 M\odot.

approach to infinitesimals, different from the better-known approach of Abraham
Robinson. The basic idea was first espoused in a paper by Curt Schmieden and
Detlof Laugwitz published in 1958. Although this ring codifies all the usual
intuitive properties of infinitesimals in a very elementary way, its existence
has been generally ignored.

follows the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The rate of entropy increase as the
payoff function is derived from statistical physics of open systems. The
thermodynamic formalism relates everything in terms of energy and describes
various ways to consume free energy. This allows us to associate game
theoretical models of behavior to physical reality. Ultimately behavior is
viewed as a physical process where flows of energy naturally select ways to
consume free energy as soon as possible. This natural process is, according to
the profound thermodynamic principle, equivalent to entropy increase in the
least time. However, the physical portrayal of behavior does not imply
determinism. On the contrary, evolutionary equation for open systems reveals
that when there are three or more degrees of freedom for behavior, the course
of a game is inherently unpredictable in detail because each move affects
motives of moves in the future. Eventually, when no moves are found to consume
more free energy, the extensive-form game has arrived at a solution concept
that satisfies the minimax theorem. The equilibrium is Lyapunov-stable against
variation in behavior within strategies but will be perturbed by a new strategy
that will draw even more surrounding resources to the game. Entropy as the
payoff function also clarifies motives of collaboration and subjective nature
of decision making.
