(SNR) Kesteven 78 and perform an XMM-Newton X-ray spectroscopic study for the
northeastern edge of the remnant. SNR Kes78 is found to interact with the
molecular clouds (MCs) at a systemic local standard of rest velocity of 81km/s.
At around this velocity, the SNR appears to contact a long molecular strip in
the northeast and a large cloud in the east as revealed in the 13CO line, which
may be responsible for the radio brightness peak and the OH maser,
respectively. The 12CO-line bright region morphologically matches the eastern
bright radio shell in general, and the SNR is consistent in extent with a CO
cavity. Broadened 12CO line profiles discerned in the eastern maser region and
the western clumpy molecular arc and the elevated 12CO J=2-1/J=1-0 ratios along
the SNR boundary may be signatures of shock perturbation in the molecular gas.
The SNR-MC association places the SNR at a kinematic distance of 4.8 kpc. The
X-rays arising from the northeastern radio shell are emitted by underionized
hot (~1.5 keV), low-density (~0.1 cm^{-3}) plasma with solar abundance, and the
plasma may be of intercloud origin. The age of the remnant is inferred to be
about 6 kyr. The size of the molecular cavity in Kes78 implies an initial mass
around 22Msun for the progenitor.

""planet candidates"") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set

target stars we assess the detectability of planets as a function of R_p and P.
We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R*/a. We consider
first stars within the ""solar subset"" having Teff = 4100-6100 K, logg =
4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp < 15 mag. We include only those stars having
noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 Re. We count planets
in small domains of R_p and P and divide by the included target stars to
calculate planet occurrence in each domain. Occurrence of planets varies by
more than three orders of magnitude and increases substantially down to the
smallest radius (2 Re) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days, ~0.25
AU) in our study. For P < 50 days, the radius distribution is given by a power
law, df/dlogR= k R^\alpha. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with
decreasing planet size agrees with core-accretion, but disagrees with
population synthesis models. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power
law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P_0. For smaller
planets, P_0 has larger values, suggesting that the ""parking distance"" for
migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured
planet occurrence over Teff = 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. The
occurrence of 2-4 Re planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing
Teff, making these small planets seven times more abundant around cool stars
than the hottest stars in our sample. [abridged]

conditions of the different molecular source components in Orion-KL. We
identify 28 methyl formate emission peaks throughout the 50"" field of
observations. The two strongest peaks are in the Compact Ridge (MF1) and in the
SouthWest of the Hot Core (MF2). Spectral confusion is still prevailing as half
of the expected transitions are blended over the region. Assuming that the
transitions are thermalized, we derive the temperature at the five main
emission peaks. At the MF1 position we find a temperature of 80K in a 1.8""x0.8""
beam size and 120K on a larger scale (3.6"" x2.2""), suggesting an external
source of heating, whereas the temperature is about 130K at the MF2 position on
both scales. Transitions of HCOOCH3 in vt=1 are detected as well and the good
agreement of the positions on the rotational diagrams between the vt=0 and the
vt=1 transitions suggests a similar temperature. The velocity of the gas is
between 7.5 and 8.0km/s depending on the positions and column density peaks
vary from 1.6x10^16 to 1.6x10^17cm^-2. A second velocity component is observed
around 9-10 km/s in a North-South structure stretching from the Compact Ridge
up to the BN object; this component is warmer at the MF1 peak. The two other
C2H4O2 isomers are not detected and the derived upper limit for the column
density is <3x10^14cm^-2 for glycolaldehyde and <2x10^15cm^-2 for acetic acid.
From the 223GHz continuum map, we identify several dust clumps with associated
gas masses in the range 0.8 to 5.8Msun. Assuming that the HCOOCH3 is spatially
distributed as the dust, we find relative abundances of HCOOCH3 in the range
<0.1x10^-8 to 5.2x10^-8. We suggest a relation between the methyl formate
distribution and shocks as traced by 2.12 mum H2 emission.

analysis the corresponding Green function is obtained. The Green function is
given by the sum of two expressions: the first one corresponds to the standard
Green function in the boundary-free cosmic string spacetime and the second
contribution is induced by the boundary. The boundary induced parts have
opposite signs for Dirichlet and Neumann scalars. Because the analysis of
vacuum polarization effects in the boundary-free cosmic string spacetime have
been developed in the literature, here we are mainly interested in the
calculations of the effects induced by the boundary. In this way closed
expressions for the corresponding expectation values are provided, as well as
their asymptotic behavior in different limiting regions is investigated. We
show that the non-trivial topology due to the cosmic string enhances the
boundary induced vacuum polarization effects for both field squared and the
energy-momentum tensor, compared to the case of a boundary in Minkowski
spacetime. The presence of the cosmic string induces non-zero stress along the
direction normal to the boundary. The corresponding vacuum force acting on the

island-size distribution are studied for the case of irreversible growth of
compact islands on a 2D substrate. In our model, we assume instantaneous
coalescence of circular islands, while the cluster mobility is assumed to
exhibit power-law decay as a function of island-size with exponent mu. Results
are presented for mu = 1/2, 1, and 3/2 corresponding to cluster diffusion via
Brownian motion, correlated evaporation-condensation, and edge-diffusion
respectively, as well as for higher values including mu = 2,3, and 6. We also
compare our results with those obtained in the limit of no cluster mobility
corresponding to mu = infinity. In agreement with theoretical predictions of
power-law behavior of the island-size distribution (ISD) for mu < 1, for mu =
1/2 we find Ns({\theta}) ~ s^{-\tau} (where Ns({\theta}) is the number of
islands of size s at coverage {\theta}) up to a cross-over island-size S_c.
However, the value of {\tau} obtained in our simulations is higher than the
mean-field (MF) prediction {\tau} = (3 - mu)/2. Similarly, the value of the
exponent {\zeta} corresponding to the dependence of S_c on the average
island-size S (e.g. S_c ~ S^{\zeta}) is also significantly higher than the MF
prediction {\zeta} = 2/(mu+1). A generalized scaling form for the ISD is also
proposed for mu < 1, and using this form excellent scaling is found for mu =
1/2. However, for finite mu >= 1 neither the generalized scaling form nor the
standard scaling form Ns({\theta}) = {\theta} /S^2 f(s/S) lead to scaling of
the entire ISD for finite values of the ratio R of the monomer diffusion rate
to deposition flux. Instead, the scaled ISD becomes more sharply peaked with
increasing R and coverage. This is in contrast to models of epitaxial growth
with limited cluster mobility for which good scaling occurs over a wide range
of coverages.

consisting of two ion species: heavier carbon ions and lighter protons.
Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations show that the radiation
pressure leads to very fast and complete spatial separation of the species. The
laser pulse does not penetrate the carbon ion layer, avoiding the proton
Rayleigh-Taylor-like (RT) instability. Ultimately, the carbon ions are heated
and spread extensively in space. In contrast, protons always ride on the front
of the carbon ion cloud, forming a compact high quality bunch. We introduce a
simple three-interface model to interpret the instability suppression in the
proton layer. The model is backed by simulations of various compound foils such
as carbon-deuterium (C-D) and carbon-tritium (C-T) foils. The effects of the
carbon ions' charge state on proton acceleration are also investigated. It is
shown that with the decrease of the carbon ion charge state, both the RT-like
instability and the Coulomb explosion degrade the energy spectrum of the
protons. Finally, full 3D simulations are performed to demonstrate the
robustness of the stable two-ion-species regime.

number of antennas at each node and where the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and
interference-to-noise ratios (INR) vary with arbitrary exponents to a nominal
SNR. The GDoF region reveals various insights through the joint dependence of
optimal interference management techniques (at high SNR) on the SNR exponents
that determine the relative strengths of direct-link SNRs and cross-link INRs
and the numbers of antennas at the four terminals. For instance, it permits an
in-depth look at the issue of rate-splitting and partial decoding and it
reveals that, unlike in the scalar IC, treating interference as noise is not
always GDoF-optimal even in the very weak interference regime. Moreover, while
the DoF-optimal strategy that relies just on transmit/receive zero-forcing
beamforming and time-sharing is not GDoF optimal (and thus has an unbounded gap
to capacity), the precise characterization of the very strong interference
regime -- where single-user DoF performance can be achieved simultaneously for
both users-- depends on the relative numbers of antennas at the four terminals
and thus deviates from what it is in the SISO case. For asymmetric numbers of
antennas at the four nodes the shape of the symmetric GDoF curve can be a
""distorted W"" curve to the extent that for certain MIMO ICs it is a ""V"" curve.

overnight discounting of cash flows originated by derivative transactions under
collateral with daily margination. We report the classical and modern

the modern Multiple-Curve CSA approach, thus incorporating credit and liquidity

gravitational field, especially in McVittie spacetime, which can be considered
as the spacetime around a gravitating body such as the Sun, embedded in the
FLRW (Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker) cosmological background metric. To
this end, we adopt the time transfer function method proposed by Le
Poncin-Lafitte {\it et al.} (Class. Quant. Grav. 21:4463, 2004) and Teyssandier
and Le Poncin-Lafitte (Class. Quant. Grav. 25:145020, 2008), which is
originally related to Synge's world function $\Omega(x_A, x_B)$ and enables to
circumvent the integration of the null geodesic equation. We re-examine the
global cosmological effect on light propagation in the solar system. The
round-trip time of a light ray/signal is given by the functions of not only the
spacial coordinates but also the emission time or reception time of light
ray/signal, which characterize the time-dependency of solutions. We also apply
the obtained results to the secular increase in the astronomical unit, reported
by Krasinsky and Brumberg (Celest. Mech. Dyn. Astron. 90:267, 2004), and we
show that the leading order terms of the time-dependent component due to
cosmological expansion is 9 orders of magnitude smaller than the observed value
of $d{\rm AU}/dt$, i.e., $15 \pm 4$ ~[m/century]. Therefore, it is not possible
to explain the secular increase in the astronomical unit in terms of
cosmological expansion.

(MF-DCCA) approaches can be used to quantify such cross-correlations, such as
the MF-DCCA based on detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-X-DFA) method. We
develop in this work a class of MF-DCCA algorithms based on the detrending
moving average analysis, called MF-X-DMA. The performances of the MF-X-DMA
algorithms are compared with the MF-X-DFA method by extensive numerical
experiments on pairs of time series generated from bivariate fractional
Brownian motions, two-component autoregressive fractionally integrated moving
average processes and binomial measures, which have theoretical expressions of
the multifractal nature. In all cases, the scaling exponents $h_{xy}$ extracted
from the MF-X-DMA and MF-X-DFA algorithms are very close to the theoretical
values. For bivariate fractional Brownian motions, the scaling exponent of the
cross-correlation is independent of the cross-correlation coefficient between
two time series and the MF-X-DFA and centered MF-X-DMA algorithms have
comparative performance, which outperform the forward and backward MF-X-DMA
algorithms. We apply these algorithms to the return time series of two stock
market indexes and to their volatilities. For the returns, the centered
MF-X-DMA algorithm gives the best estimates of $h_{xy}(q)$ since its
$h_{xy}(2)$ is closest to 0.5 as expected, and the MF-X-DFA algorithm has the
second best performance. For the volatilities, the forward and backward
MF-X-DMA algorithms give similar results, while the centered MF-X-DMA and the
MF-X-DFA algorithms fails to extract rational multifractal nature.

mass loss rates predicted by the model are in accordance with those of
observation. The most important physical process in coupling each component is
charge exchange which tightly couples atomic hydrogen with protons. Most of the
hydrogen escaping from hot Jupiters is protons, especially in young star-planet

particles when the mass loss rate is higher than a few times $10^{9}$ g/s while
below $10^{9}$ g/s the multi-fluid model is more suitable for it due to the
decoupling of particles. We found that the predicted mass loss rates of HD

wind which is almost compose of protons, the assumption of energy-limit is no

combining deep Chandra (100 ks) with 1.4 GHz VLA observations, we find evidence

massive object at high redshift. We show that by comparing the effects of
primordial non-Gaussianity on cluster abundance with that on void abundance, we
can distinguish between the skewness and the kurtosis types of primordial
non-Gaussianity. As for early star formation, we show that the kurtosis type of
primordial non-Gaussianity seems not to affect the reionization history of the

further show that the rate of change of the geometric phase reveals its

Of the three sources for which we obtained good data, two are unclassified

radio sources is not dictated by unified schemes of AGN. In the case of the
detection, the absorption only occurs towards one of the two resolved radio
lobes in PKS 1649-062. If the absorption is due to an another intervening
galaxy, or cool HI gas in the intergalactic medium, covering only the
south-west lobe, then, being at the same redshift, this is likely to be
gravitationally bound to the optical object identified as PKS 1649-062. If the
absorption is due to an inclined disk centred between the lobes, intervening

radio wavelengths. The double-peaked nature of the optical emission line
spectra has been suggested as evidence for the existence of binary black holes
in these AGN, although this interpretation is controversial. We make a simple
suggestion, that direct evidence of binary black holes in these objects could
be searched for in the form of dual sources of compact radio emission
associated with the AGN. To explore this idea, we have used the Very Long
Baseline Array to observe these 11 objects from the Wang et al. (2009a) sample.
Of the 11 objects, we detect compact radio emission from two, SDSS
J151709+335324 and SDSS J160024+264035. Both objects show single components of
compact radio emission. The morphology of SDSS J151709+335324 is consistent
with a recent comprehensive multi-wavelength study of this object by Rosario et
al. (2010). Assuming that the entire sample consists of binary black holes, we
would expect of order one double radio core to be detected, based on radio
wavelength detection rates from FIRST and VLBI surveys. We have not detected
any double cores, thus this work does not substantially support the idea that
AGN with double-peaked optical emission lines contain binary black holes.
However, the study of larger samples should be undertaken to provide a more
secure statistical result, given the estimated detection rates.

preferred stimulus is presented, but adapt as stimulation continues. The
functional consequences of adaptation are unclear. Typically a reduction of
firing rate would reduce single neuron accuracy as less spikes are available
for decoding, but it has been suggested that on the population level,
adaptation increases coding accuracy. This question requires careful analysis
as adaptation not only changes the firing rates of neurons, but also the neural
variability and correlations between neurons, which affect coding accuracy as
well. We calculate the coding accuracy using a computational model that
implements two forms of adaptation: spike frequency adaptation and synaptic
adaptation in the form of short-term synaptic plasticity. We find that the net
effect of adaptation is subtle and heterogeneous. Depending on adaptation
mechanism and test stimulus, adaptation can either increase or decrease coding
accuracy. We discuss the neurophysiological and psychophysical implications of
the findings and relate it to published experimental data.

approximation is applied to the uncorrelated flat Rayleigh fading channel with
unknown channel state information at the receiver. It is shown that the
proposed approximation greatly simplifies the calculation of channel LLRs, and
yet provides results almost identical to those based on the exact calculation
of channel LLRs. The results are obtained in the context of bit-interleaved
coded modulation (BICM) schemes with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and
include threshold calculations and error rate performance of finite-length
codes. Compared to the existing approximations, the proposed method is either
significantly less complex, or considerably more accurate.

constrained nonlinear systems. It is based on the use of a hybridization, that
is a hybrid abstraction of the nonlinear dynamics. This abstraction is defined
on a triangulation of the state-space where on each simplex of the
triangulation, the nonlinear dynamics is conservatively approximated by an
affine system subject to disturbances. Except for the disturbances, this
hybridization can be seen as a piecewise affine hybrid system on simplices for
which appealing control synthesis techniques have been developed in the past
decade. We extend these techniques to handle systems subject to disturbances by
synthesizing and coordinating local robust affine controllers defined on the
simplices of the triangulation. We show that the resulting hybrid controller
can be used to control successfully the original constrained nonlinear system.
Our approach, though conservative, can be fully automated and is
computationally tractable. To show its effectiveness in practical applications,
we apply our method to control a pendulum mounted on a cart.

""Class I"" defined by $|M_{e\mu}| = |M_{e\tau}|$, and ""Class II"" defined by
$|M_{\mu\mu}| = |M_{\tau\tau}|$. The important phenomenological distinction
between the two is that Class I permits only ""small"" values of $V_{e3}$ up to
$\sim 0.03$, while Class II admits ""large"" values of $V_{e3}$ up to its
empirical upper limit of 0.22. Then we introduce CP-violating complex phases
into the mass matrix. We show that it is possible to have tribimaximal mixing
with $M_{ee} = 0$ and $|M_{\mu\tau}| = |M_{\mu\mu}| = |M_{\tau\tau}|$ if the
Majorana phase angles are $\pm\pi/4$. Alternatively, for smaller values of
$|M_{\mu\tau}| = |M_{\mu\mu}| = |M_{\tau\tau}|$ it is possible to obtain
$|V_{e3}| \sim 0.2$ and generate relatively large CP-violating amplitudes. To
eliminate phase redundancy, we emphasize rephasing any mass matrix with $M_{ee}

between analytical and numerical but remains purely phenomenological, without
any attempt to derive mass matrices from a fundamental theory.

domains of prevalence of the ingoing and outgoing wavefunction terms. The
structure of the quantum-mechanical currents in the neighborhood of the
separator implies the formation of an array of \emph{quantum vortices}. The
flow structure around each vortex displays a characteristic pattern called
`nodal point - X point complex'. The X point gives rise to stable and unstable
manifolds. We find the scaling laws characterizing a nodal point-X point
complex by a local perturbation theory around the nodal point. We then analyze
the dynamical role of vortices in the emergence of the diffraction pattern. In
particular, we demonstrate the abrupt deflections, along the direction of the

important mechanism, which drives solar activity in all its facets. For
example, photospheric flows are responsible for the advection of magnetic flux,
the redistribution of flux during the decay of sunspots, and the built-up of
magnetic shear in flaring active regions. Aims: Systematic studies based on
G-band data from the Japanese Hinode mission provide the means to gather
statistical properties of horizontal flow fields. This facilitates comparative
studies of solar features, e.g., G-band bright points, magnetic knots, pores,
and sunspots at various stages of evolution and in distinct magnetic
environments, thus, enhancing our understanding of the dynamic Sun. Methods: We
adapted Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) to measure horizontal flow fields
based on G-band images obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope on board
Hinode. In total about 200 time-series with a duration between 1-16 h and a
cadence between 15-90 s were analyzed. Selecting both a high-cadence (dt = 15
s) and a long-duration (dT = 16 h) time-series enabled us to optimize and
validate the LCT input parameters, hence, ensuring a robust, reliable, uniform,
and accurate processing of a huge data volume. Results: The LCT algorithm
produces best results for G-band images having a cadence of 60-90 s. If the
cadence is lower, the velocity of slowly moving features will not be reliably
detected. If the cadence is higher, the scene on the Sun will have evolved too
much to bear any resemblance with the earlier situation. Consequently, in both
instances horizontal proper motions are underestimated. The most reliable and
yet detailed flow maps are produced using a Gaussian kernel with a size of 2560
km x 2560 km and a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 1200 km (corresponding

which accuracy requirements it is beneficial to adapt this paradigm for
computing a collection of functions including binary sum, gap threshold, and

calculated using the self-consistent microscopic theory. In addition to the
standard RPA or QRPA approaches, the method includes the quasiparticle-phonon
coupling and the single-particle continuum. The results obtained show that the
phonon contribution is very noticeable for the pygmy-dipole resonance, which,
as it is known, is important for a description of the radiative neutron
capture. The phonon contribution to the pygmy-dipole resonance and to the
radiative neutron capture cross sections is increased with the (N-Z) difference
growth. For example, in the (0-10) MeV interval the full theory gives 17% of
EWSR for 150S n and 2.8% for 124S n, whereas within the continuum QRPA approach
we have 5.1% and 1.7%, respectively. These facts indicate an important role of
the self-consistent calculations that are of astrophysical interest for
neutron-rich nuclei. The comparison with the phenomenological Generalized
Lorentzian approach by Kopecky-Uhl has shown that the (Q)RPA approach gives a
significant increase in the cross section by a factor of 2 for 132S n and a
factor of 10 for 150S n and inclusion of the phonon coupling increases the
cross sections for these nuclei even more, by a factor of 2-3.

triplet resonances between nearby modes. In addition to strong chaos we observe
a weakly chaotic component having much smaller Lyapunov exponent, the measure

smallest couplings we were able to reach. We argue that this weak chaos is
linked to the regime of fast Arnold diffusion discussed by Chirikov and
Vecheslavov. In disordered lattices of large size we find a subdiffusive
spreading of initially localized wave packets over larger and larger number of

information regarding the emission mechanism and the geometry of various
astrophysical sources, like neutron stars, accreting black holes, pulsar wind
nebulae, AGNs, Supernova Remnants etc. and can help us to probe matter under
extreme magnetic fields and extreme gravitational fields. Although the three
other domains of X-ray Astronomy i.e. timing, spectral and imaging are well
developed, there has been very little progress in X-ray Polarimetry with only
one definitive polarisation measurement and a few upper limits available so
far. Radiation from accreting black holes in their thermal dominated (High
Soft) state is expected to be polarised due to scattering in the plane parallel
atmosphere of the disk. Also, special and general relativistic effects in the
innermost parts of the disk predicts energy dependent rotation in the plane of
polarisation and some distinct signatures which can be used as a probe for
measuring the parameters of the black hole like its spin, emissivity profile
and the angle of inclination of the system. We present the results from an

polarisation, the polarisation angle measurement is also important, hence the

Buyers and sellers in
successful markets carry out cooperative transactions even if they do not know
each other in advance and a moral hazard exists. An indispensable component
that enables cooperation in such social dilemma situations is the reputation
system. Under the reputation system, a buyer can avoid transacting with a
seller with a bad reputation. A transaction in online marketplaces is better
modeled by the trust game than other social dilemma games, including the
donation game and the prisoner's dilemma. In addition, most individuals
participate mostly as buyers or sellers; each individual does not play the two
roles with equal probability. Although the reputation mechanism is known to be
able to remove the moral hazard in games with asymmetric roles, competition
between different strategies and population dynamics of such a game are not
sufficiently understood. On the other hand, existing models of reputation-based
cooperation, also known as indirect reciprocity, are based on the symmetric
donation game. We analyze the trust game with two fixed roles, where trustees
(i.e., sellers) but not investors (i.e., buyers) possess reputation scores. We
study the equilibria and the replicator dynamics of the game. We show that the
reputation mechanism enables cooperation between unacquainted buyers and

years because it does not require users neither to master a certain structured

existing methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static
databases. In practice, however, databases are updated frequently, and users
may have long-term interests on specific topics. To deal with such a situation,
it is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in database systems
to support continual keyword queries evaluation.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient method for continual keyword queries
answering over relational databases. The proposed method consists of two core
algorithms. The first one computes a set of potential top-$k$ results by
evaluating the ranges of the future relevance score for every query result and
create a light-weight state for each keyword query. The second one uses these
states to maintain the top-$k$ results of keyword queries when the database is
continually growing. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed method.

uncertainties play a relatively minor role. Driven by this observation, we
emphasize the use of the Bayesian statistical method, which allows us to
straightforwardly (i) vary the gauge coupling strength, g', of the underlying
U(1)'; (ii) include interference effects with the Z' amplitude (which are
especially important for large g'); (iii) smoothly vary the U(1)' charges; (iv)
combine these data with the electroweak precision constraints as well as with
other observables obtained from colliders such as LEP 2 and the LHC; and (v)
find preferred regions in parameter space once an excess is seen. We adopt this
method as a complementary approach for a couple of sample models and find
limits on the Z' mass, generally differing by only a few percent from the
corresponding CDF ones when we follow their approach. Another general result is
that the interference effects are quite relevant if one aims at discriminating
between models. Finally, the Bayesian approach frees us of any ad hoc
assumptions about the number of events needed to constitute a signal or
exclusion limit for various actual and hypothetical reference energies and
luminosities at the Tevatron and the LHC.

achieve high data reliability. Unfortunately, the use of redundancy introduces
storage and communication overheads, which can either reduce the overall
storage capacity of the system or increase its costs. To mitigate the storage
and communication overhead, different redundancy schemes have been proposed.
However, due to the great variety of underlaying storage infrastructures and
the different application needs, optimizing these redundancy schemes for each
storage infrastructure is cumbersome. The lack of rules to determine the
optimal level of redundancy for each storage configuration leads developers in
industry to often choose simpler redundancy schemes, which are usually not the
optimal ones. In this paper we analyze the cost of different redundancy schemes
and derive a set of rules to determine which redundancy scheme minimizes the
storage and the communication costs for a given system configuration.
Additionally, we use simulation to show that theoretically-optimal schemes may
not be viable in a realistic setting where nodes can go off-line and repairs
may be delayed. In these cases, we identify which are the trade-offs between
the storage and communication overheads of the redundancy scheme and its data
reliability.

Our final sample contains sources with magnitudes I<16mag and estimated masses

divided into two main groups. The first one contains sources with higher pm in
agreement with other Gould Belt populations and with spatial distribution,
optical and near-infrared colours, and disk composition consistent with these
objects belonging to the Lupus clouds. In the second group, sources have lower
pm with random orientations, and they are mostly located outside the cloud

with it being a genuine population of the Lupus star-forming region. More

topological charge |Q|=1/2. We compare such intersections with the distribution
of zeromodes of the Dirac operator in the fundamental and adjoint
representation using both the overlap and asqtad staggered fermion formulations
in SU(2) lattice gauge theory. We analyze configurations with four
intersections and find that the probability density distribution of fundamental
zeromodes in the intersection plane differs significantly from the one obtained
analytically in [Phys.\ Rev.\ D 66, 85004 (2002)]. The Dirac eigenmodes are
clearly sensitive to the traces of the Polyakov (Wilson) lines and do not
exactly locate topological charge contributions. Although, the adjoint Dirac
operator is able to produce zeromodes for configurations with topological
charge |Q|=1/2, they do not locate single vortex intersections, as we prove by
forming arbitrary linear combinations of these zeromodes - their scalar density
peaks at least at two intersection points. With pairs of thin and thick
vortices we realize a situation similar to configurations with topological
charge |Q|=1/2. For such configurations the zeromodes do not localize in the
regions of fractional topological charge contribution but spread over the whole
lattice, avoiding regions of negative traces of Polyakov lines.

method for generating extra redundant bits, such as to decreases the coding
rate of a mother code. The proposed method allows for using the same decoder,
regardless of how many extra redundant bits have been produced, which
considerably increases the flexibility of the system without significantly
increasing its complexity. Extended codes are also optimized for the binary
erasure channel, by using density evolution methods. Nevertheless, the results
presented in this paper can easily be extrapolated to more general channel
models.

contract to the true parameter at a rate that depends on the smoothness of the

these characteristics lead to the minimax rate. The frequentist coverage of
credible sets is shown to depend on the combination of prior and true

conservative coverage. In the latter case credible sets are of the correct
order of magnitude. The results are numerically illustrated by the problem of
recovering a function from observation of a noisy version of its primitive.

decompositions of tensors, by means of tensors of rank 1. The method is based
on the geometric notion of weak defectivity. For three-dimensional tensors of
type (a, b, c), a\le b\le c, our method proves that the decomposition is unique
(i.e. k-identifiability holds) for general tensors of rank k, as soon as k\le
(a+1)(b+1)/16. This improves considerably the known range for identifiability.
The method applies also to tensor of higher dimension. For tensors of small
size, we give a complete list of situations where identifiability does not
hold. Among them, there are 4\times4\times4 tensors of rank 6, an interesting
case because of its connection with the study of DNA strings.

with a known group structure, when the groups are assumed to be sign-coherent,
that is, gathering either nonnegative, nonpositive or null parameters. To
tackle this problem, we propose the cooperative-Lasso penalty. We derive the
optimality conditions defining the cooperative-Lasso estimate for generalized
linear models, and propose an efficient active set algorithm suited to
high-dimensional problems. We study the asymptotic consistency of the estimator
in the linear regression setup and derive its irrepresentable conditions, which
are milder than the ones of the group-Lasso regarding the matching of groups
with the sparsity pattern of the true parameters. We also address the problem
of model selection in linear regression by deriving an approximation of the
degrees of freedom of the cooperative-Lasso estimator. Simulations comparing
the proposed estimator to the group and sparse group-Lasso comply with our
theoretical results, showing consistent improvements in support recovery for
sign-coherent groups. We finally propose two examples illustrating the wide
applicability of the cooperative-Lasso: first to the processing of ordinal
variables, where the penalty acts as a monotonicity prior; second to the
processing of genomic data, where the set of differentially expressed probes is
enriched by incorporating all the probes of the microarray that are related to
the corresponding genes.

Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter. We first ignore special relativistic
effects and derive a differential equation governing the evolution of the
density contrast in the linear regime taking into account quantum pressure and
self-interaction. This equation can be solved analytically in several cases. We
argue that an attractive self-interaction can enhance the Jeans instability and
fasten the formation of structures. Then, we take into account pressure effects
(coming from special relativity) in the evolution of the cosmic fluid and add
the contribution of radiation, baryons and dark energy (cosmological constant).
For a BEC dark matter with repulsive self-interaction (positive pressure) the
scale factor increases more rapidly than in the standard \Lambda CDM model
where dark matter is pressureless while for a BEC dark matter with attractive
self-interaction (negative pressure) it increases less rapidly. We study the
linear development of the perturbations in these two cases and show that the
perturbations grow faster in a BEC dark matter than in a pressureless dark
matter. This confirms a recent result of Harko (2011). Finally, we consider a
""dark fluid"" with a generalized equation of state p=(\alpha \rho + k \rho
^2)c^2 having a component p=k \rho ^2 c^2 similar to a BEC dark matter and a
component p=\alpha \rho c^2 mimicking the effect of the cosmological constant
(dark energy). We find optimal parameters that give a good agreement with the
standard \Lambda CDM model assuming a finite cosmological constant.
