utilizing high-quality infrared flux measurements of the AKARI All-Sky Survey
and physical quantities based on optical and 21-cm observations. Our goal is to
understand the physics determining the infrared spectral energy distribution
(SED). The ratio of the total infrared luminosity L_TIR, to the star-formation
rate (SFR) is tightly correlated by a power-law to specific SFR (SSFR), and
L_TIR is a good SFR indicator only for galaxies with the largest SSFR. We
discovered a tight linear correlation for normal galaxies between the radiation
field strength of dust heating, estimated by infrared SED fits (U_h), and that
of galactic-scale infrared emission (U_TIR ~ L_TIR/R^2), where R is the optical
size of a galaxy. The dispersion of U_h along this relation is 0.3 dex,
corresponding to 13% dispersion in the dust temperature. This scaling and the
U_h/U_TIR ratio can be explained physically by a thin layer of heating sources
embedded in a thicker, optically-thick dust screen. The data also indicate that
the heated fraction of the total dust mass is anti-correlated to the dust
column density, supporting this interpretation. In the large U_TIR limit, the
data of circumnuclear starbursts indicate the existence of an upper limit on
U_h, corresponding to the maximum SFR per gas mass of ~ 10 Gyr^{-1}. We find
that the number of galaxies sharply drops when they become optically thin
against dust-heating radiation, suggesting that a feedback process to galaxy
formation (likely by the photoelectric heating) is working when dust-heating
radiation is not self-shielded on a galactic scale. Implications are discussed
for the M_HI-size relation, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and galaxy
formation in the cosmological context.

promoted via a word of mouth mobilization on the Italian blogosphere, V-day
brought close to one million Italians in the streets on a single day, but was
mostly ignored by mainstream media. This article is divided into two parts. In
the first part, we analyze the volume and content of online articles published
by both bloggers and mainstream news sources from June 14 (the day V-day was
announced) until September 15, 2007 (one week after it took place) . We find
that the success of V-day can be attributed to the coverage of bloggers and
small-scale local news outlets only, suggesting a strong grassroots component
in the organization of the rally. We also find a dissonant thematic
relationship between content published by blogs and mainstream media: while the
majority of blogs analyzed promote V-day, major mainstream media sources
critique the methods of information production and dissemination employed by
Grillo. Based on this finding, in the second part of the study, we explore the
role of Grillo in the organization of the rally from a network analysis
perspective. We study the interlinking structure of the V-day blogosphere
network, to determine its structure, its levels of heterogeneity, and
resilience. Our analysis contradicts the hypothesis that Grillo served as a
top-down, broadcast-like source of information. Rather, we find that
information about V-day was transferred across heterogeneous nodes in a
moderately robust and resilient core network of blogs. We speculate that the
organization of V-day represents the very first case, in Italian history, of a
political demonstration developed and promoted primarily via the use of social

as cold dark matter. The mixed axion/neutralino CDM scenario can match the
measured dark matter abundance for SUSY models which typically give too low a
value of the usual thermal neutralino abundance, such as models with wino-like
or higgsino-like dark matter. The usual thermal neutralino abundance can be
greatly enhanced by the decay of thermally-produced axinos to neutralinos,
followed by neutralino re-annihilation at temperatures much lower than
freeze-out. In this case, the relic density is usually neutralino dominated,
and goes as \sim (f_a/N)/m_{axino}^{3/2}. If axino decay occurs before
neutralino freeze-out, then instead the neutralino abundance can be augmented
by relic axions to match the measured abundance. Entropy production from
late-time axino decays can diminish the axion abundance, but ultimately not the
neutralino abundance. In mixed axion/neutralino CDM models, it may be possible
to detect both a WIMP and an axion as dark matter relics. We also discuss
possible modifications of our results due to production and decay of saxions.

form factor $f_0(q^2)$. This form factor is obtained from a scalar current
matrix element that does not require any operator matching. We find $f^{D
\rightarrow K}_0(0) \equiv f^{D \rightarrow K}_+(0) = 0.747(19)$ in the chiral
plus continuum limit and hereby improve the theory error on this quantity by a
factor of $\sim$4 compared to previous lattice determinations. Combining the
new theory result with recent experimental measurements of the product $f^{D
\rightarrow K}_+(0) * |V_{cs}| $ from BaBar and CLEO-c leads to a very precise
direct determination of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}| $, $|V_{cs}| =
0.961(11)(24)$, where the first error comes from experiment and the second is
the lattice QCD theory error.

behaviors as evidenced by correlations among the observable pulse properties of
duration, peak luminosity, fluence, spectral hardness, energy-dependent lag,
and asymmetry. Long and Short burst pulses exhibit these behaviors, suggesting
that a similar process is responsible for producing all GRB pulses. That these
properties correlate in the observer's frame indicates that intrinsic
correlations are strong enough to not be diluted into insignificance by the
dispersion in distances and redshift. We show how all correlated pulse
characteristics can be explained by hard-to-soft pulse evolution, and we
demonstrate that ""intensity tracking"" pulses not having these properties are
not single pulses; they instead appear to be composed of two or more
overlapping hard-to-soft pulses. In order to better understand pulse
characteristics, we recognize that hard-to-soft evolution provides a more
accurate definition of a pulse than its intensity variation. This realization,
coupled with the observation that pulses begin near-simultaneously across a
wide range of energies, leads us to conclude that the observed pulse emission
represents the energy decay resulting from an initial injection, and that one
simple and as yet unspecified physical mechanism is likely to be responsible
for all gamma-ray burst pulses regardless of the environment in which they form
and, if GRBs originate from different progenitors, then of the progenitors that
supply them with energy.

substantial potential benefits for improving the power system's reliability. In
this paper, the problem of sensor selection is studied for the MAC layer design
of wireless sensor networks for regulating the voltages in smart grid. The
framework of hybrid dynamical system is proposed, using Kalman filter for
voltage state estimation and LQR feedback control for voltage adjustment. The
approach to obtain the optimal sensor selection sequence is studied. A sub-
optimal sequence is obtained by applying the sliding window algorithm.
Simulation results show that the proposed sensor selection strategy achieves a
40% performance gain over the baseline algorithm of the round-robin sensor

betweenness distributions which implies that these networks naturally segragate
in two different classes of nodes and links. We introduce a technique based on
effective distances, shortest paths and shortest-path trees for strongly
weighted symmetric networks and show that in a shortest-path-tree

seen. We show that effective shortest-path distance, unlike conventional
geographic distance measures, strongly correlates with node centrality
measures. Using the new technique we show that network resilience can be

characteristics and resilience to network disruption. Finally we discuss the
results, their implications and conclude that dynamic processes that evolve on

through an AGB final/late thermal pulse (AFTP/LTP scenario). Then we calculate
the consequent white dwarf cooling evolution by means of a consistent treatment
of element diffusion and nuclear burning. Based on physically sounding white
dwarf models, we find that the range of helium buffer masses for these
diffusion-induced novas to occur is significantly smaller than that predicted
by the only previous study of this scenario. As a matter of fact, we find that
these flashes do occur only in some low-mass (M < 0.6M) and low metallicity

these objects, we expect the luminosity to increase by about 4 orders of

should display a very typical eruption lightcurve, with an increase of about a
few magnitudes per year before reaching a maximum of M_V ~ -5 to -6. Our

modeling the helices of RNA secondary structure. Here, we benchmark the method
using six molecules for which crystallographic data are available: tRNA(phe)
and 5S rRNA from Escherichia coli, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I
ribozyme, and ligand-bound domains from riboswitches for adenine, cyclic
di-GMP, and glycine. SHAPE-directed modeling of these highly structured RNAs
gave an overall false negative rate (FNR) of 17% and a false discovery rate
(FDR) of 21%, with at least one helix prediction error in five of the six
cases. Extensive variations of data processing, normalization, and modeling
parameters did not significantly mitigate modeling errors. Only one varation,
filtering out data collected with deoxyinosine triphosphate during primer
extension, gave a modest improvement (FNR = 12%, and FDR = 14%). The residual
structure modeling errors are explained by the insufficient information content
of these RNAs' SHAPE data, as evaluated by a nonparametric bootstrapping
analysis. Beyond these benchmark cases, bootstrapping suggests a low level of
confidence (<50%) in the majority of helices in a previously proposed

3311. We obtained VIMOS medium resolution spectra of about 1200 candidate
objects with apparent magnitudes 18.5 < V < 24.0 mag, covering both the bright
end of the GC luminosity function and the luminosity range of all known UCDs.
By means of spectroscopic redshift measurements, we identified 118 cluster
members, from which 52 are brighter than M_V = -11.0 mag, and can therefore be
termed UCDs. The brightest UCD in our sample has an absolute magnitude of M_V =
-13.4 mag (corresponding to a mass of > 5 x 10^7 M_sun) and a half-light radius
of 25 pc. This places it among the brightest and most massive UCDs ever
discovered. Most of the GCs/UCDs are both spatially and dynamically associated
to the central cD galaxy. The overall velocity dispersion of the GCs/UCDs is
comparable to what is found for the cluster galaxies. However, when splitting
the sample into a bright and a faint part, we observe a lower velocity
dispersion for the bright UCDs/GCs than for the fainter objects. At a dividing
magnitude of M_V = -10.75 mag, the dispersions differ by more than 200 km/s,
and up to 300 km/s for objects within 5 arcmin around NGC 3311. We interpret
these results in the context of different UCD formation channels, and conclude

on the formation and growth of NCs. Mergers of star clusters are able to
produce a wide variety of observed properties, including densities, structural
scaling relations, shapes (including the presence of young discs) and even
rapid rotation. Nonetheless, difficulties remain, most notably that the second
order kinematic moment V_rms = (V^2 + sigma^2)^(1/2) of the models is too
centrally peaked to match observations. This can be remedied by the merger of
star clusters onto a pre-existing nuclear disc, but the line-of-sight velocity
V is still more slowly rising than in NGC 4244. Our results therefore suggest
that purely stellar dynamical mergers cannot form NCs, and that gas dissipation
is a necessary ingredient for at least ~50% of a NC's mass. The negative
vertical anisotropy found in NGC 4244 however requires at least 10% of the mass

Large Volume Scenarios with matter and gauge interactions. The general analysis
is based on a family of N=1 Supergravity models with a factorizable Kaehler
invariant function, where the decoupling between two sets of fields without a
mass hierarchy is easily understood. For the Large Volume Scenario particular
analyses are performed for explicit models, one of such developed for the first
time here, finding that the simplified version, where the Dilaton and Complex
structure moduli are regarded as frozen by a previous stabilization, is a
reliable supersymmetric description whenever the neglected fields stand at
their leading F-flatness conditions and be neutral. The terms missed by the
simplified approach are either suppressed by powers of the Calabi-Yau volume,
or are higher order operators in the matter fields, and then irrelevant for the
moduli stabilization rocedure. Although the power of the volume suppressing
such corrections depends on the particular model, up to the mass level it is
independent of the modular weight for the matter fields. This at least for the
models studied here but we give arguments to expect the same in general. These
claims are checked through numerical examples. We discuss how the factorizable
models present a context where despite the lack of a hierarchy with the
supersymmetry breaking scale, the effective theory still has a supersymmetric
description. This can be understood from the fact that it is possible to find
vanishing solution for the auxiliary components of the fields being integrated
out, independently of the remaining dynamics. Our results settle down the
question on the reliability of the way the Dilaton and Complex structure are
treated in type-IIB compactifications with large compact manifold volumina.

evolving under dissipative forces. In particular, we investigate the case when
dissipative forces affect the planetary semi-major axes and the planets move
inward/outward the central star, in a process known as planet migration. To
perform this investigation, we introduce fundamental concepts of conservative
and dissipative dynamics of the three-body problem. Based on these concepts, we
develop a qualitative model of the secular evolution of the migrating planetary
pair. Our approach is based on analysis of the energy and the orbital angular
momentum exchange between the two-planet system and an external medium; thus no
specific kind of dissipative forces is invoked. We show that, under assumption
that dissipation is weak and slow, the evolutionary routes of the migrating
planets are traced by the Mode I and Mode II stationary solutions of the
conservative secular problem. The ultimate convergence and the evolution of the
system along one of these secular modes of motion is determined uniquely by the
condition that the dissipation rate is sufficiently smaller than the proper
secular frequency of the system. We show that it is possible to reassemble the
starting configurations and migration history of the systems on the basis of
their final states and consequently to constrain the parameters of the physical
processes involved.

emanating from the donor star has partially been accreted by the white dwarf,

we assume that the system moves with a velocity of 250 km/s. Due to the
systemic motion the interaction between the wind and the interstellar medium
has resulted in the formation of a bow shock, which can explain the presence of
a one-sided, nitrogen rich shell. We present two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of both the shell formation and the SNR evolution. The SNR
simulations show good agreement with the observed kinematic and morphological
properties of Kepler's SNR. Specifically, the model reproduces the observed
expansion parameters (m=V/(R/t)) of m=0.35 in the north and m=0.6 in the south
of Kepler's SNR. We discuss the variations among our hydrodynamical simulations

of the initial density of the fluid for various values of the inflow velocity
in order to investigate whether or not sufficiently arbitrary initial
conditions allow a steady state accretion process depending on the values of
the pressure. We extrapolate our results to the case where the fluid
corresponds to dark matter and the black hole is a supermassive black hole
seed. Then we estimate the equation of state parameters that provide a steady
state accretion process. We found that when the pressure of the dark matter is
zero, the black hole's mass grows up to values that are orders of magnitude
above $10^{9}M_{\odot}$ during a lapse of 10Gyr, whereas in the case of the
accretion of the ideal gas dark matter with non zero pressure the accreted mass
can be of the order of $\sim 1M_{\odot}/10Gyr$ for black holes of
$10^{6}M_{\odot}$. This would imply that if dark matter near a supermassive
black hole acquires an equation of state with non trivial pressure, the
contribution of accreted dark matter to the supermassive black hole growth
could be small, even though only radial accretion is considered.

and its evolution, for collisional cascades of planetesimals undergoing
destructive collisions and loss processes like Poynting-Robertson drag. The
scheme treats the steady state portion of the cascade by equating mass loss and
gain in each size bin; the smallest particles are expected to reach steady
state on their collision timescale, while larger particles retain their
primordial distribution. For collision-dominated disks, steady state means that
mass loss rates in logarithmic size bins are independent of size. This
prescription reproduces the expected two phase size distribution, with ripples
above the blow-out size, and above the transition to gravity-dominated
planetesimal strength. The scheme also reproduces the expected evolution of
disk mass, and of dust mass, but is computationally much faster than evolving
distributions forward in time. For low-mass disks, P-R drag causes a turnover
at small sizes to a size distribution that is set by the redistribution
function (the mass distribution of fragments produced in collisions). Thus
information about the redistribution function may be recovered by measuring the
size distribution of particles undergoing loss by P-R drag, such as that traced
by particles accreted onto Earth. Although cross-sectional area drops with
1/age^2 in the PR-dominated regime, dust mass falls as 1/age^2.8, underlining
the importance of understanding which particle sizes contribute to an
observation when considering how disk detectability evolves. Other loss
processes are readily incorporated; we also discuss generalised power law loss

cosmological constant Omega_Lambda, predicts that the Universe expansion
decelerates from early times to redshift z~0.9 and accelerates at later times.
On the contrary, the cosmological model based on conformal gravity predicts
that the cosmic expansion has always been accelerating. To distinguish between
these two very different cosmologies, we resort to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),
which have been suggested to probe the Universe expansion history at z>1, where
identified type Ia supernovae (SNe) are rare. We use the full Bayesian approach
to infer the cosmological parameters and the additional parameters required to
describe the GRB data available in the literature. For the first time, we use
GRBs as cosmological probes without any prior information from other data. In
addition, when we combine the GRB samples with SNe, our approach neatly avoids
all the inconsistencies of most numerous previous methods that are plagued by
the so-called circularity problem. In fact, when analyzed properly, current
data are consistent with distance moduli of GRBs and SNe that can respectively
be, in a variant of conformal gravity, ~15 and ~3 magnitudes fainter than in
LambdaCDM. Our results indicate that the currently available SN and GRB samples
are accommodated equally well by both LambdaCDM and conformal gravity and do
not exclude a continuous accelerated expansion. We conclude that GRBs are
currently far from being effective cosmological probes, as they are unable to
distinguish between these two very different expansion histories.

This
technique allows to measure the oxygenation of the brain tissue. The particular
problems involved in detecting regional brain oxygenation (rSO2) are discussed.
The dominant chromophore (light absorber) in tissue is water. Only in the NIR
light region of 650-1000 nm, the overall absorption is sufficiently low, and
the NIR light can be detected across a thick layer of tissues, among them the
skin, the scull and the brain. In this region, there are many absorbing light
chromophores, but only three are important as far as the oxygenation is
concerned. They are the hemoglobin (HbO2), the deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and
cytochrome oxidase (CtOx). In the last 20 years there was an enormous growth in
the instrumentation and applications of NIRS. . The devices that were used in
our experiments were : Somanetics's INVOS Brain Oximeter (IBO) and Toomim's HEG
spectrophotometer. The performances of both devices were compared including
their merits and drawbacks. The IBO is based on extensive efforts of an R&D
group to develop a reliable device, which measures well the rSO2. It is now
used efficiently in operating rooms, saving human lives and expenses. Its use
for research however has two drawbacks: the sampling rate is too small and the
readings are limited to only two significant digits. The HEG device does not
have these drawbacks, but is not developed sufficiently at this time to measure
rSO2. We have measured the HEG readings and compared them with the rSO2
readings of the IBO. Our findings show that the HEG can be used to measure
relative changes of rSO2.

metamaterial that creates a very large loss contrast between the dark and

temperature of Nb, the resistance contrast opens up a transparency window along
with a large enhancement in group delay, enabling a significant slowdown of

changes in the superfluid density. Such tunable metamaterials may be useful for
telecommunication because of their large delay-bandwidth products.

R-parity conservation can be explained dynamically allows for two types of B-L
models. In the first scenario the new Higgses decay mainly into two
right-handed neutrinos giving rise to exotic lepton number violating signals
together with displaced vertices. In the second model one could have peculiar
channels with multileptons and/or multiphotons in the final state. In both
cases, the local B-L gauge symmetry is broken at the TeV scale and the
discovery of the new Higgs bosons may be possible at the LHC. We investigate in
detail the production mechanisms for the Higgs bosons relevant for the LHC and
the key decays which would shed light on how R-parity is conserved. These
results may help to understand the link between the cold dark matter of the

to find the Taylor series of the metric tensor ($C^\infty$ jet) at the

whether the lens data determine metric structure uniquely. Lens data include
information of boundary distance function, the lengths of all geodesics, and
the locations and directions where geodesics hit the boundary. We give the
first examples that show that lens data cannot uniquely determine the jet. The
example include two manifolds with the same boundary and the same lens data,

transient CSS100217:102913+404220 (CSS100217 hereafter). Spectroscopic
observations show this transient was coincident with a galaxy at redshift
z=0.147, and reached an apparent magnitude of V ~ 16.3. After correcting for
foreground Galactic extinction we determine the absolute magnitude to be M_V
=-22.7 approximately 45 days after maximum light. Based on our unfiltered
optical photometry the peak optical emission was L = 1.3 x 10^45 erg s^-1, and
over a period of 287 rest-frame days had an integrated bolometric luminosity of
1.2 x 10^52 erg. Analysis of the pre-outburst SDSS spectrum of the source shows
features consistent with a Narrow-line Seyfert1 (NLS1) galaxy. High-resolution
HST and Keck followup observations show the event occurred within 150pc of
nucleus of the galaxy, suggesting a possible link to the active nuclear region.
However, the rapid outburst along with photometric and spectroscopic evolution
are much more consistent with a luminous supernova. Line diagnostics suggest
that the host galaxy is undergoing significant star formation. We use extensive
follow-up of the event along with archival CSS and SDSS data to investigate the
three most likely sources of such an event; 1) an extremely luminous supernova;
2) the tidal disruption of a star by the massive nuclear black hole; 3)
variability of the central AGN. We find that CSS100217 was likely an extremely
luminous type IIn supernova that occurred within range of the narrow-line
region of an AGN. We discuss how similar events may have been missed in past
supernova surveys because of confusion with AGN activity.

over the ciphertext image. However, this measurement does not consider to the
randomness of local image blocks and is inappropriate for scrambling based
image encryption methods. In this paper, a new information entropy-based
randomness measurement for image encryption is introduced which, for the first
time, answers the question of whether a given ciphertext image is sufficiently
random-like. It measures the randomness over the ciphertext in a fairer way by
calculating the averaged entropy of a series of small image blocks within the
entire test image. In order to fulfill both quantitative and qualitative
measurement, the expectation and the variance of this averaged block entropy
for a true-random image are strictly derived and corresponding numerical
reference tables are also provided. Moreover, a hypothesis test at
significance-level is given to help accept or reject the hypothesis that the
test image is ideally encrypted/random-like. Simulation results show that the
proposed test is able to give both effectively quantitative and qualitative
results for image encryption. The same idea can also be applied to measure
other digital data, like audio and video.

ask if at time t, instead of a random direction one is allowed to choose the

strongly correlated quantum fluids. They have a rich phase diagram and exhibit
a variety of quantum phase transitions. We consider a one-dimensional spinor
gas of bosons with a large spin $S$. A particular example is the gas of
chromium atoms (S=3), where the dipolar collisions efficiently change the
magnetization and make the system sensitive to the linear Zeeman effect. We
argue that in one dimension the most interesting effects come from the pairing
interaction. If this interaction is negative, it gives rise to a
(quasi)condensate of singlet bosonic pairs with an algebraic order at zero
temperature, and for $(2S+1)\gg 1$ the saddle point approximation leads to
physically transparent results. Since in one dimension one needs a finite
energy to destroy a pair, the spectrum of spin excitations has a gap. Hence, in
the absence of magnetic field there is only one gapless mode corresponding to
phase fluctuations of the pair quasicondensate. Once the magnetic field exceeds
the gap another condensate emerges, namely the quasicondensate of unpaired
bosons with spins aligned along the magnetic field. The spectrum then contains
two gapless modes corresponding to the singlet-paired and spin-aligned unpaired
bose-condensed particles, respectively. At T=0 the corresponding phase
transition is of the commensurate-incommensurate type.

may not only be useful in point-to-point single-hop source and channel coding,
in multiple access and broadcast channels, but that they may also be useful in
larger relay networks. The usage of lattice codes in larger networks is
motivated by their structured nature (possibly leading to rate gains) and
decoding (relatively simple) being more practically realizable than their
random coding based counterparts. We furthermore expect the proposed
lattice-based CF scheme to constitute a first step towards a generic structured
achievability scheme for networks such as a structured version of the recently

stochastic approximation of a regularization path converging to the regression

possible to produce the best known strong (RKHS norm) convergence rate of batch
learning, through a careful choice of the gain or step size sequences,

corresponding weak (mean square distance) convergence rate is optimal in the

In both cases we deduce almost sure convergence, using Bernstein-type
inequalities for martingales in Hilbert spaces.
  To achieve this we develop a bias-variance decomposition similar to the batch
learning setting; the bias consists in the approximation and drift errors along
the regularization path, which display the same rates of convergence, and the
variance arises from the sample error analysed as a reverse martingale
difference sequence. The rates above are obtained by an optimal trade-off

Firstly we model the spectral evolution of the X-ray line and continuum
emission flux F(\epsilon) from the flare by integrating a series of isothermal
plasma flux. We find that multi-temperature integrated flux F(\epsilon) is a
power-law function of \epsilon with a spectral index (\gamma) \approx -4.65.
Next, based on spectral-temporal evolution of the flares we find that the
emission in the energy range E= 4 - 15 keV is dominated by temperatures of T=
12 - 50 MK, while the multi-thermal power-law DEM index (\gamma) varies in the
range of -4.4 and -5.7. The temporal evolution of the X-ray flux F(\epsilon,t)
assuming a multi-temperature plasma governed by thermal conduction cooling
reveals that the temperature-dependent cooling time varies between 296 and 4640

features of more luminous Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) but exhibit a much
lower nuclear Halpha luminosity than their more luminous counterparts. M87 (NGC
4486) and Centaurus A (NGC 5128, CenA) are well-studied nearby LLAGNs. As an
additional feature they show gamma-radiation up to TeV (10^{12}eV) energies,
but the origin of this radiation is not resolved. The coincident observation of
a radio and TeV flare in M87 suggests that the TeV radiation is produced within
around 50-100 gravitational radii of the central supermassive black hole,
depending on the assumed value of the mass of the black hole. Strong radiation
fields can be produced in the central region of an (LL)AGN, e.g., by the
accretion flow around the black hole, the jet plasma, or stars closely orbiting
the black hole. These radiation fields can lead to the absorption of emitted
TeV photons, and in fact high optical depths of such fields can make TeV
detection from inner regions impossible. In this paper we consider the
accretion flow around the black hole as the most prominent source for such a
radiation field and we accordingly calculate the probability for absorption of
TeV photons produced near the black holes in M87 and CenA assuming a low
luminosity Shakura-Sunyaev Disk (SSD). We find that the results are very
different for between the two LLAGNs. While the inner region of M87 is
transparent for TeV radiation up to 15TeV, the optical depth in CenA is >> 1,
leading to an absorption of TeV photons that might be produced near the central
black hole. These results imply either that the TeV gamma production sites and
processes are different for both sources, or that LLAGN black holes do not
accrete (at least only) in form of a low luminosity SSD.

Alternatively, half of the vertical magnetic patches accommodate the horizontal

incompressible fluid mechanics is the Burgers vortex. We show that, in a finite
domain, conformal fluids also admit hot vortex solutions with everywhere
nonrelativistic speeds. These are identical to Burgers' solution, except that
their radius is reduced by a factor of 2/sqrt(3). A rough calculation indicates
that at RHIC these vortices are indeed smaller than the fireball itself during
thermalization. Similarly to the Burgers vortex, these solutions manifest
vortex stretching which avoids short distance singularities and so suggests
that conformal fluid flows share the same nonsingularity as solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations. Naively generalizing this calculation to an arbitrary
equation of state w, we observe that the Burgers vortex radius diverges as w
crosses -1. While it has been argued that such a crossover leads to an
instability in certain perfect fluids, the absence of Burgers vortices and
therefore vortex stretching suggests that, in addition to the well-studied big
rip singularities, viscous phantom fluids generically develop vorticity

  Krishnan","On the Complexity of Edge Packing and Vertex Packing",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the computational complexity of the Edge Packing problem
and the Vertex Packing problem. The edge packing problem (denoted by
$\bar{EDS}$) and the vertex packing problem (denoted by $\bar{DS} $) are linear
programming duals of the edge dominating set problem and the dominating set
problem respectively. It is shown that these two problems are equivalent to the
set packing problem with respect to hardness of approximation and parametric
complexity. It follows that $\bar{EDS}$ and $\bar{DS}$ cannot be approximated
asymptotically within a factor of $O(N^{1/2-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$
unless $NP=ZPP$ where, $N$ is the number of vertices in the given graph. This
is in contrast with the fact that the edge dominating set problem is
2-approximable where as the dominating set problem is known to have an $O(\log$
$|V|)$ approximation algorithm. It also follows from our proof that $\bar{EDS}$
and $\bar{DS}$ are $W[1]$-complete.

detected in the hard X-ray band in the 3-years all sky survey performed by the
Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard the Swift satellite. All the black holes
powering these blazars exceed a billion solar mass, with accretion luminosities
close to the Eddington limit. For each blazar pointing at us, there must be
hundreds of similar sources (having black holes of similar masses) pointing
elsewhere. This puts constraints on the density of billion solar masses black
holes at high redshift (z>4), and on the relative importance of (jetted)
radio-loud vs radio-quiet sources. We compare the expected number of high
redshift radio--loud sources with the high luminosity radio-loud quasars
detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), finding agreement up to z~3,
but a serious deficit at z>3 of SDSS radio-loud quasars with respect to the
expectations. We suggest that the most likely explanations for this
disagreement are: i) the ratio of blazar to misaligned radio-sources decreases
by an order of magnitude above z=3, possibly as a result of a decrease of the
average bulk Lorentz factor; ii) the SDSS misses a large fraction of radio-loud
sources at high redshifts, iii) the SDSS misses both radio-loud and radio-quiet
quasars at high redshift, possibly because of obscuration or because of
collimation of the optical-UV continuum in systems accreting near Eddington.
These explanations imply very different number density of heavy black holes at
high redshifts, that we discuss in the framework of the current ideas about the
relations of dark matter haloes at high redshifts and the black hole they host.

summarize the discussions on the mass assembly processes at various redshifts

cosmic web filaments may increase with redshift. The baryonic Tully-Fisher

after the Big-Bang and is then evolving until the present day. This evolution

LSD/AMAZE samples is highlighted. At z~3 this discovery might be linked to cold
gas accretion along cosmic filaments toward the centre whereas at lower

neutrino factories as an additional channel that could help in lifting
degeneracies and improving sensitivities to neutrino oscillation parameters,
viz., \theta_{13}, \delta_{CP}, mass hierarchy, deviation of \theta_{23} from
maximality and its octant. This channel corresponds to \nu_\mu -> \nu_e (or the
corresponding anti-particle) oscillations of the initial neutrino flux, with
the subsequent detection of (positrons) electrons from charged current
interactions of the (anti-) \nu_e in the detector. For small values of
\theta_{13}, the dominant \nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau (or corresponding anti-particle)
oscillation results in this signal being swamped by electrons arising from the
leptonic decay of taus produced in charge-current interactions of \nu_\tau
(anti-\nu_\tau) with the detector. We examine for the first time the role of
this tau contamination to the electron events sample and find that it plays a
significant role in the platinum channel compared to other channels, not only
at high energy neutrino factories but surprisingly even at low energy neutrino
factories. Even when the platinum channel is considered in combination with
other channels such as the golden (muon appearance) or muon disappearance
channel, the tau contamination results in a loss in precision of the measured

Quantum Field Theory which has to do with the nature of the built in

debate and discussions during the last few decades. Nevertheless, although the
issues at hand could in principle be tested experimentally, the smallness of
such apparent violations of causality in Quantum Electrodynamics prevented the
observation of the predicted effect. In the present paper we show that the
problem can be simulated within the framework of discrete systems that can be
manifested, for instance, by trapped atoms in optical lattices or trapped ions.
Unlike the original continuum case, the causal structure is no longer sharp.
Nevertheless, as we show, it is possible to distinguish between ""trivial""

Fermi's problem, even in such discrete settings. The ability to control
externally the strength of the atom-field interactions, enables us also to
study both the original Fermi problem with ""bare atoms"", as well as correction
in the scenario that involves ""dressed"" atoms. Finally, we show that in

density under gravity is investigated by means of a formal multiple-scale
perturbative expansion in the scale-separation parametre between the carrier
flow and the particle concentration field. The resulting large-scale equation
for the particle concentration is determined, and is found to be diffusive with
a positive-definite eddy diffusivity. The calculation of the latter tensor is
reduced to the resolution of an auxiliary differential problem, consisting of a
coupled set of two differential equations in a (6+1)-dimensional coordinate
system (3 space coordinates plus 3 velocity coordinates plus time). Although
expensive, numerical methods can be exploited to obtain the eddy diffusivity,
for any desirable non-perturbative limit (e.g. arbitrary Stokes and Froude
numbers). The aforementioned large-scale equation is then specialized to deal
with two different relevant perturbative limits: i) vanishing of both Stokes
time and sedimenting particle velocity; ii) vanishing Stokes time and finite
sedimenting particle velocity. Both asymptotics lead to a greatly simplified
auxiliary differential problem, now involving only space coordinates and thus
easy to be tackled by standard numerical techniques. Explicit, exact
expressions for the eddy diffusivities have been calculated, for both
asymptotics, for the class of parallel flows, both static and time-dependent.
This allows us to investigate analytically the role of gravity and inertia on
the diffusion process by varying relevant features of the carrier flow, as e.g.
the form of its temporal correlation function. Our results exclude a universal
role played by gravity and inertia on the diffusive behaviour: regimes of both
enhanced and reduced diffusion may exist, depending on the detailed structure
of the carrier flow.

Georgiou and Lindquist in 2000 which, in turn, followed in the footsteps of the
Burg-Jaynes Maximum Entropy Method. Spectral estimation is here recast in the
form of a constrained spectrum approximation problem where the distance is
equal to the processes relative entropy rate. The corresponding solution
entails a complexity upper bound which improves on the one so far available in
the multichannel framework. Indeed, it is equal to the one featured by THREE in
the scalar case. The solution is computed via a globally convergent matricial
Newton-type algorithm. Simulations suggest the effectiveness of the new
technique in tackling multivariate spectral estimation tasks, especially in the
case of short data records.

in a novel universality class for heavy fermion quantum criticality in the
presence of strong randomness. Starting from an Anderson lattice model with
disorder, we derive an effective local field theory in the dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT) approximation, where randomness is introduced into both
hybridization and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. Performing
the saddle-point analysis in the U(1) slave-boson representation, we reveal its
phase diagram which shows a quantum phase transition from a spin liquid state
to a local Fermi liquid phase. In contrast with the clean limit of the Anderson
lattice model, the effective hybridization given by holon condensation turns
out to vanish, resulting from the zero mean value of the hybridization coupling
constant. However, we show that the holon density becomes finite when variance
of hybridization is sufficiently larger than that of the RKKY coupling, giving
rise to the Kondo effect. On the other hand, when the variance of hybridization
becomes smaller than that of the RKKY coupling, the Kondo effect disappears,
resulting in a fully symmetric paramagnetic state, adiabatically connected with
the spin liquid state of the disordered Heisenberg model. ......

Immorlica, Mirrokni and Nazerzadeh [Approx 2009] as a measure of quality for
approximation algorithms. There this concept was applied to facility location
problems. In the current work we apply a similar framework to the maximum
independent set problem (MIS). We say that an approximation algorithm has {\em
recoverable value} $\rho$, if for every graph it recovers an independent set of
size at least $\max_I \sum_{v\in I} \min[1,\rho/(d(v) + 1)]$, where $d(v)$ is
the degree of vertex $v$, and $I$ ranges over all independent sets in $G$.
Hence, in a sense, from every vertex $v$ in the maximum independent set the
algorithm recovers a value of at least $\rho/(d_v + 1)$ towards the solution.
This quality measure is most effective in graphs in which the maximum
independent set is composed of low degree vertices. It easily follows from
known results that some simple algorithms for MIS ensure $\rho \ge 1$. We
design a new randomized algorithm for MIS that ensures an expected recoverable
value of at least $\rho \ge 7/3$. In addition, we show that approximating MIS
in graphs with a given $k$-coloring within a ratio larger than $2/k$ is unique
games hard. This rules out a natural approach for obtaining $\rho \ge 2$.

better identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. This
information together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensing
analysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, so
that a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrain
the inner mass profile, $d\log \Sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.6\pm 0.1$ (r<160 kpc).
We find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the full
range spanned by the lensed images, 1.01<z<6.03, with the higher redshift
sources deflected through larger angles as expected. The inner mass profile
derived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensing
analysis of wide-field Subaru images, with good agreement in the region of
overlap. The overall mass profile is well fitted by an NFW profile with
M_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}M_{\odot}/h and a relatively
high concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\pm 0.23, which lies above the
standard c-M relation similar to other well-studied clusters. The critical
radius of Abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,
r_{E}\simeq16\pm2\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number of
lensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates our
imaging strategy for the CLASH survey. In total we aim to provide similarly
high-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are X-ray selected

binarization techniques; Otsu's method represents global threshold technique;
Sauvola and Niblack method which are categorized as local threshold techniques.
We compared the binarized images with the original manuscript to be visually
inspected by the museum's curator. The unclear features were marked and
analyzed. Most of the examined images show that with optimal parameters and
effective pre processing technique, local thresholding methods are work well
compare with the other one. Niblack's and Sauvola's techniques seem to be the
suitable approaches for these types of images. Most of binarized images with
these two methods show improvement for readability and character recognition.
For this research, even the differences of image result were hard to be
distinguished by human capabilities, after comparing the time cost and overall
achievement rate of recognized symbols, Niblack's method is performing better
than Sauvola's. We could improve the post processing step by adding edge
detection techniques and further enhanced by an innovative image refinement
technique and a formulation of a class proper method.

exploits analytical solutions derived by Eshelby for ellipsoidal inclusions in
order to determine the mechanical perturbation fields as a result of the

fields are then incorporated into a finite element formulation to augment those
of the macroscopic fields. A significant feature of this approach is that the
finite element mesh does not explicitly resolve the heterogeneities and that no
additional degrees of freedom are introduced. In this paper, hybrid-Trefftz
stress finite elements are utilised and performance of the proposed formulation
is demonstrated with numerical examples. The method is restricted here to
elastic particulate composites with ellipsoidal inclusions but it has been
designed to be extensible to a wider class of materials comprising arbitrary

unclear if the high-mass star formation process is a scaled-up version of the
low-mass one, we investigated whether the relation between deuteration and
evolution can be applied to the high-mass regime. With the IRAM-30m telescope,
we observed rotational transitions of N2D+ and N2H+ and derived the deuterated
fraction in 27 cores within massive star-forming regions understood to
represent different evolutionary stages of the massive-star formation process.
Results. Our results clearly indicate that the abundance of N2D+ is higher at
the pre-stellar/cluster stage, then drops during the formation of the
protostellar object(s) as in the low-mass regime, remaining relatively constant
during the ultra-compact HII region phase. The objects with the highest
fractional abundance of N2D+ are starless cores with properties very similar to
typical pre-stellar cores of lower mass. The abundance of N2D+ is lower in
objects with higher gas temperatures as in the low-mass case but does not seem
to depend on gas turbulence. Our results indicate that the N2D+-to-N2H+ column
density ratio can be used as an evolutionary indicator in both low- and
high-mass star formation, and that the physical conditions influencing the
abundance of deuterated species likely evolve similarly during the processes
that lead to the formation of both low- and high-mass stars.

singularity develops when k>1 which constitutes one of the striking effects of
the power Maxwell field. For specific power parameter k, the occurrence of
timelike naked singularity is analysed in quantum mechanical point of view.
Quantum test fields obeying the Klein - Gordon and the Dirac equations are used
to probe the singularity. It is shown that the class of static pure magnetic
spacetime in the power Maxwell theory is quantum mechanically singular when it
is probed with fields obeying Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the generic
case.

  Response of Limit Cycles Verging on a Heteroclinic Orbit","32 pages, 10 figures, 57 references",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rhythmic behaviors in neural systems often combine features of limit cycle
dynamics (stability and periodicity) with features of near heteroclinic or near
homoclinic cycle dynamics (extended dwell times in localized regions of phase
space). Proximity of a limit cycle to one or more saddle equilibria can have a
profound effect on the timing of trajectory components and response to both
fast and slow perturbations, providing a possible mechanism for adaptive
control of rhythmic motions. Reyn showed that for a planar dynamical system
with a stable heteroclinic cycle (or separatrix polygon), small perturbations
satisfying a net inflow condition will generically give rise to a stable limit
cycle (Reyn, 1980; Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1983). Here we consider the
asymptotic behavior of the infinitesimal phase response curve (iPRC) for
examples of two systems satisfying Reyn's inflow criterion, (i) a smooth system
with a chain of four hyperbolic saddle points and (ii) a piecewise linear
system corresponding to local linearization of the smooth system about its
saddle points. For system (ii), we obtain exact expressions for the limit cycle
and the iPRC as a function of a parameter, mu>0, representing the distance from
a heteroclinic bifurcation point. In the limit, as mu approaches zero, we find
that perturbations parallel to the unstable eigenvector direction in a
piecewise linear region lead to divergent phase response, as previously
observed (Brown, Moehlis and Holmes (2004), Neural Computation). In contrast to
previous work, we find that perturbations parallel to the stable eigenvector
direction can lead to either divergent or convergent phase response, depending
on the phase at which the perturbation occurs. In the smooth system (i), we
show numerical evidence of qualitatively similar phase specific sensitivity to
perturbation.

eastern edge of the supernova remnant resulting from the interaction of the
supernova blast wave with density enhancements at the edge of a precursor
formed cavity. To study the nature and origin of the X-ray emission we use high
spatial resolution images from Chandra. Our goal is to probe the density of
various spectral extraction regions to form a picture of the cavity wall and
characterize the interaction between this supernova and the local interstellar
medium. We find that a series of regions along the edge of the X-ray emission
appears to trace out the location of the cavity wall. The best fit plasma
models result in two temperature component equilibrium models for each region.
The low temperature components have densities that are an order of magnitude
higher than the high temperature components. The high density plasma may exist
in the cavity wall where it equilibrates rapidly and cools efficiently. The low
density plasma is interior to the enhancement and heated further by a reverse
shock from the wall. Calculations of shock velocities and timescales since
shock heating are consistent with this interpretation. Furthermore, we find a
bright knot of emission indicative of a discrete interaction of the blast wave
with a high density cloud in the cavity wall with a size scale ~0.1 pc. Aside
from this, other extractions made interior to the X-ray edge are confused by
line of sight projection of various components. Some of these regions show
evidence of detecting the cavity wall but their location makes the
interpretation difficult. In general, the softer plasmas are well fit at
temperatures kT~0.11 keV, with harder plasmas at temperatures of kT~0.27 keV.
All regions display consistent metal depletions most notably in N, O, and Ne at
an average of 0.54, 0.55, and 0.36 times solar.

magnetized, due to the ubiquitous presence of a tangled magnetic field at

reached through detailed three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer modeling of
the Hanle effect in the Sr I 4607 line, using the microturbulent field
approximation and assuming that the shape of the probability density function
of the magnetic field strength is exponential. Here we relax both
approximations by modeling the observed scattering polarization in terms of the
Hanle effect produced by the magnetic field of a 3D photospheric model
resulting from a (state-of-the-art) magneto-convection simulation with surface
dynamo action. We show that the scattering polarization amplitudes observed in
the Sr I 4607 line can be explained only after enhancing the magnetic strength
of the photospheric model by a sizable scaling factor, F=10, which implies <B>
= 130 G in the upper photosphere. We argue also that in order to explain both
the Hanle depolarization of the Sr I 4607 line and the Zeeman signals observed
in Fe I lines we need to introduce a height-dependent scaling factor, such that
the ensuing <B> = 160 G in the low photosphere and <B> = 130 G in the upper

conditioned by y if and only if y is random conditioned by x, and (2) while
O(1) amount of advice regarding the source is not enough for extracting a
string with randomness rate 1 from a source string with constant random rate,
\omega(1) amount of advice is. The proofs use Kolmogorov extractors as the main
technical device.

preferentially over the nodal region in the underdoped regime. We can then
define the fraction of coherent Fermi surface, $f_c$ around the nodes for which
quasiparticles are well defined and superconductivity sets in. We find that
$f_c$ is doping dependent and leads to the emergence of two energy scales. We
then establish in a one single gap shem, that the critical temperature $T_{c}
\propto f_{c}\Delta_{max}$ where $\Delta_{max}$ is the maximum amplitude of the
d-wave superconducting gap. In the normal state, the loss of antinodal
quasiparticles spectral weight detected in the superconducting state persists
and the spectral weight is only restored above the pseudogap temperature $T*$.
Such a dichotomy in the quasiparticles dynamics is then responsible for the
emergence of the two energy scales in the superconducting state and the
appearance of the pseudogap in the normal state. We propose a 3D phase diagram
where both the temperature and the energy phase diagrams have been plotted
together. We anticipate that the development of coherent excitations on a
restricted part of the Fermi surface only is a general feature in high $T_c$
cuprate superconductors as the Mott insulating is approaching.

has been the subject of considerable theoretical and observational efforts in
the past few years. Sco X-1 is a microquasar from which evidence of highly
energetic particles in the jet has been found when it is in the so-called
Horizontal Branch (HB), a state when the radio and hard X-ray fluxes are higher
and a powerful relativistic jet is present. Here we present the first very high
energy gamma-ray observations of Sco X-1 obtained with the MAGIC telescopes. An
analysis of the whole dataset does not yield a significant signal, with 95% CL
flux upper limits above 300 GeV at the level of 2.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s.
Simultaneous RXTE observations were conducted to search for TeV emission during
particular X-ray states of the source. A selection of the gamma-ray data
obtained during the HB based on the X-ray colors did not yield a signal either,
with an upper limit of 3.4x10^{-12} ph/cm^2/s. These upper limits place a
constraint on the maximum TeV luminosity to non-thermal X-ray luminosity of
L_{VHE}/L_{ntX}<0.02, that can be related to a maximum TeV luminosity to jet
power ratio of L_{VHE}/L_{j}<10^{-3}. Our upper limits indicate that the
underlying high-energy emission physics in Sco X-1 must be inherently different
from that of the hitherto detected gamma-ray binaries.

preference function that samples from nodes using a uniform random peer

both the necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence to a complete
gradient structure, as well as estimating the convergence time and providing
bounds on worst-case convergence time. Finally, we show in simulations the
potential of the Gradient overlay, by building a more efficient live-streaming

the measured cross sections are compared to predictions of a number of hadronic

ATLAS results are able to discriminate between different models and between
certain theoretical approaches for soft multi-particle production. On the other
hand, the strong model-dependence of the selection efficiency of the
minimum-bias triggers prevents one from inferring high mass diffraction rate
from the discussed data. Moreover, the measured cross sections prove to be

\cite{Li} (see also Section 10.20 in Eells-Lemaire's report \cite{EL}). In this
paper, we study a subclass of f-harmonic maps called f-harmonic morphisms which
pull back local harmonic functions to local f-harmonic functions. We prove that
a map between Riemannian manifolds is an f-harmonic morphism if and only if it
is a horizontally weakly conformal f-harmonic map. This generalizes the
well-known Fuglede-Ishihara characterization for harmonic morphisms. Some
properties and many examples as well as some non-existence of f-harmonic
morphisms are given. We also study the f-harmonicity of conformal immersions.

function C(z) in a rectangle we calculate various quantities of interest for
percolation (SLE parameter \kappa = 6) and many other two-dimensional critical
points. In particular, we specify the density at z of critical clusters
conditioned to touch either or both vertical sides of the rectangle, with these
sides 'wired,' i.e. constrained to be in a single cluster, and the horizontal
sides free. These quantities probe the structure of various cluster
configurations, including those that contribute to the crossing probability.
  We first examine the effects of boundary conditions on C for the critical
O(n) loop models in both high and low density phases and for both
Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) and spin clusters in the critical Q-state Potts models.
A Coulomb gas analysis then allows us to calculate the cluster densities with
various conditionings in terms of the known conformal blocks. Explicit formulas
generalizing Cardy's horizontal crossing probability to these models (using
previously known results) are also presented.
  These solutions are employed to generalize previous results demonstrating
factorization of higher-order correlation functions to the critical systems
mentioned. An explicit formula for the density of critical percolation clusters
that cross a rectangle horizontally with free boundary conditions is also
given. Simplifications of the hypergeometric functions in our solutions for
various models are presented.
  High precision simulations verify these predictions for percolation and for
the Q=2 and 3-state Potts models, including both FK and spin clusters. Our
formula for the density of crossing clusters in percolation in open systems is
also verified.

scaling z=3 which is minimally coupled to geometry in 3+1 space-time
dimensions. We find that the result is identical to the relativistic case using
path integral methods. An independent verification is provided by showing with
spectral methods that the eta-invariant of the Dirac and Lifshitz fermion
operators in three dimensions are equal. Thus, by the integrated form of the
anomaly, the index of the Dirac operator still accounts for the possible
breakdown of chiral symmetry in non-relativistic theories of gravity. We apply
this framework to the recently constructed gravitational instanton backgrounds
of Horava-Lifshitz theory and find that the index is non-zero provided that the
space-time foliation admits leaves with harmonic spinors. Using Hitchin's
construction of harmonic spinors on Berger spheres, we obtain explicit results
for the index of the fermion operator on all such gravitational instanton
backgrounds with SU(2)xU(1) isometry. In contrast to the instantons of Einstein
gravity, chiral symmetry breaking becomes possible in the unimodular phase of
Horava-Lifshitz theory arising at lambda = 1/3 provided that the volume of
space is bounded from below by the ratio of the Ricci to Cotton tensor
couplings raised to the third power. Some other aspects of the anomalies in
non-relativistic quantum field theories are also discussed.

  rates","In press in Genetics",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Theories to explain the prevalence of sex and recombination have long been a
central theme of evolutionary biology. Yet despite decades of attention
dedicated to the evolution of sex and recombination, the widespread pattern of
sex-differences in the recombination rate is not well understood and has
received relatively little theoretical attention. Here, we argue that female
meiotic drivers - alleles that increase in frequency by exploiting the
asymmetric cell division of oogenesis - present a potent selective pressure
favoring the modification of the female recombination rate. Because
recombination plays a central role in shaping patterns of variation within and
among dyads, modifiers of the female recombination rate can function as potent
suppressors or enhancers of female meiotic drive. We show that when female
recombination modifiers are unlinked to female drivers, recombination modifiers
that suppress harmful female drive can spread. By contrast, a recombination
modifier tightly linked to a driver can increase in frequency by enhancing
female drive. Our results predict that rapidly evolving female recombination
rates, particularly around centromeres, should be a common outcome of meiotic
drive. We discuss how selection to modify the efficacy of meiotic drive may
contribute to commonly observed patterns of sex-differences in recombination.

ternary: ternary relative velocity is a velocity of a body with respect to an
interior observer as seen by a preferred exterior-observer. The Lorentz boosts
imply non-associative addition of ternary relative velocities. Within
Einstein's special relativity theory, each preferred observer (fixed stars,
aether, etc), determine the unique relative velocity among each pair of massive
bodies. Therefore, the special relativity founded on Minkowski's axiom, that
each pair of reference systems must be related by Lorentz isometry, needs a
preferred reference system in order to have the unique Einstein's relative
velocity among each pair of massive bodies. This choice-dependence of relative
velocity violate the Relativity Principle that all reference systems must be
equivalent. This astonishing conflict of the Lorentz relativity group, with the
Relativity Principle, can be resolved in two alternative ways. Either, abandon
the Relativity Principle in favor of a preferred reference system [de Abreu
2004; de Abreu and Guerra 2005, 2006]. Or, within the Relativity Principle,
replace the Lorentz relativity group by the relativity groupoid, with the
choice-free binary relative velocities introduced by Minkowski in 1908. Binary
- means that the relative velocity is a function of a pair of reference
systems. Following Minkowski [1908], we consider the binary relative velocity
to be the Minkowski space-like vector (and not the Minkowski bivector as it is
in the Hestenes theory [Hestenes 1974]).
