several solutions to the quantum state reconstruction problem using von Neumann
measurements. The set of solutions are known as Pauli partners, which are not
easy to find even numerically. We present, in a self-contained paper, a new way
to find this solutions using the physical imposition operator. We show that
every Pauli partner is an attractive fixed point of this operator, which means
that we can find complete sets of Pauli partners very efficiently. As a
particular case, we found numerically 24 mutually unbiased bases in dimension
N=23 in less than 30 seconds in a standard PC. We hope that the algorithm

Tight Frames and Quantum t-Designs, which could open new possibilities to find

probe the vertical distribution of aerosols down to the surface. On Mars, we

depending on season. Temporal variations in the vertical size distribution of
aerosols are also highlighted. On Titan, an aerosols scale height of 80 \pm 10

wavelength as a power-law with an exponent of -2.0 \pm 0.4 from a value of 2.3

calculate root mean-square averages are shown to have remarkable effects on
$\alpha_1$. With grains of pyramidal shape, $\alpha_1$ can be as low as 0.71,

$\chi_1\approx 0.5$ for flat grains, while for some conical grains it may
increase to $\chi_1\approx 0.7$. The universality class of the growth process

of the interference is incorporated into the imaging solution, which includes
applying a total-variation minimization based approach where the relative

low energy physics and direct collider searches, these models are usually
constrained by the requirement of reproducing the observations on dark matter

on the dark matter bounds both considering the standard cosmological model and
alternative cosmological scenarios. These scenarios do not change the
observable cosmology but relic dark matter density bounds strongly depend on
them. We consider few benchmark points excluded by standard cosmology dark
matter bounds and suggest that loosening the dark matter constraints is
necessary in order to avoid a too strong (cosmological) model dependence in the

the accuracy that cosmological parameters can be measured with a given
experiment, and to optimise the design of experiments. However, the standard
approach usually assumes both data and parameter estimates are
Gaussian-distributed. Further, for survey forecasts and optimisation it is
usually assumed the power-spectra covariance matrix is diagonal in
Fourier-space. But in the low-redshift Universe, non-linear mode-coupling will
tend to correlate small-scale power, moving information from lower to
higher-order moments of the field. This movement of information will change the
predictions of cosmological parameter accuracy. In this paper we quantify this
loss of information by comparing naive Gaussian Fisher matrix forecasts with a
Maximum Likelihood parameter estimation analysis of a suite of mock weak
lensing catalogues derived from N-body simulations, based on the SUNGLASS
pipeline, for a 2-D and tomographic shear analysis of a Euclid-like survey. In
both cases we find that the 68% confidence area of the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane
increases by a factor 5. However, the marginal errors increase by just 20 to
40%. We propose a new method to model the effects of nonlinear shear-power
mode-coupling in the Fisher Matrix by approximating the shear-power
distribution as a multivariate Gaussian with a covariance matrix derived from
the mock weak lensing survey. We find that this approximation can reproduce the
68% confidence regions of the full Maximum Likelihood analysis in the
Omega_m-sigma_8 plane to high accuracy for both 2-D and tomographic weak
lensing surveys. Finally, we perform a multi-parameter analysis of Omega_m,
sigma_8, h, n_s, w_0 and w_a to compare the Gaussian and non-linear
mode-coupled Fisher matrix contours. (Abridged)

of population into a single metastable state, one can create several narrow
amplifying resonances. At frequencies between these gain lines and additional
absorption lines, there exist regions of vanishing absorption but resonantly
enhanced index of refraction. In $Rb$ vapors with density $N$ in units of

at very-high energies (VHE; E$>$100 GeV) triggered by the X-ray outburst in
December 2009. The observations started shortly after the onset of the
outburst, and they provided comprehensive coverage of the episode, as well as
the 111-day binary orbit. No VHE emission is evident at any time. We also
examined data from the contemporaneous observations of 1A 0535+262 with the
Fermi/LAT at high energy photons (HE; E$>$0.1 GeV) and failed to detect the
source at GeV energies. The X-ray continua measured with the Swift/XRT and the
RXTE/PCA can be well described by the combination of blackbody and Comptonized
emission from thermal electrons. Therefore, the gamma-ray and X-ray
observations suggest the absence of a significant population of non-thermal
particles in the system. This distinguishes 1A~0535+262 from those Be X-ray

assumptions. The simplifying assumptions considered so far were (i) the state
can be well approximated to be of low rank, or (ii) the state can be well
approximated as a matrix product state. We add one more method in that same
spirit: we allow in principle any model for the state, using any (small) number
of parameters (which can, e.g., be chosen to have a clear physical meaning),
and the data are used to verify the model. The proof that this method is valid
cannot be as strict as in above-mentioned cases, but is based on
well-established statistical methods that go under the name of ""information

spectrum with eleven clearly detected periods in the range 376 to 566 s, and at

border of antiferromagnetic order. Consequently, these materials could provide
clues about the relationship between magnetism and unconventional
superconductivity. One explanation, motivated by the so-called bad-metal
behaviour of these materials, proposes that magnetism and superconductivity
develop out of quasi-localized magnetic moments which are generated by strong
electron-electron correlations. Another suggests that these phenomena are the
result of weakly interacting electron states that lie on nested Fermi surfaces.
Here we address the issue by comparing the newly discovered alkaline iron
selenide superconductors, which exhibit no Fermi-surface nesting, to their iron
pnictide counterparts. We show that the strong-coupling approach leads to
similar pairing amplitudes in these materials, despite their different Fermi
surfaces. We also find that the pairing amplitudes are largest at the boundary
between electronic localization and itinerancy, suggesting that new
superconductors might be found in materials with similar characteristics.

magneto-rotational instability in the gas disk, planetesimals and protoplanets
undergo diffusive radial migration as well as changes in other orbital
properties. The magnitude of the effect on particle orbits can have important
consequences for planet formation scenarios. We use the local-shearing-box
approximation to simulate an ideal, isothermal, magnetized gas disk with
vertical density stratification and simultaneously evolve numerous massless
particles moving under the gravitational field of the gas and the host star. We
measure the evolution of the particle orbital properties, including mean
radius, eccentricity, inclination, and velocity dispersion, and its dependence
on the disk properties and the particle initial conditions. Although the
results converge with resolution for fixed box dimensions, we find the response
of the particles to the gravity of the turbulent gas correlates with the
horizontal box size, up to 16 disk scale heights. This correlation indicates
that caution should be exercised when interpreting local-shearing-box models
involving gravitational physics of magneto-rotational turbulence. Based on
heuristic arguments, nevertheless, the criterion L_h / R ~ O(1), where L_h is
the horizontal box size and R is the distance to the host star, is proposed to
possibly circumvent this conundrum. If this criterion holds, we can still
conclude that magneto-rotational turbulence seems likely to be ineffective at
driving either diffusive migration or collisional erosion under most
circumstances.

significantly extend the method to include a different treatment for central
and satellite galaxies, allowing the stellar mass of satellite galaxies to
depend on both the host subhalo mass, and on the halo mass. Unlike in previous
studies, our models are constrained by two observations: the stellar mass
function of galaxies, and their auto-correlation functions (CFs). We present
results for ~10^6 different successful models, showing that the uncertainty in
the host subhalo mass reaches a factor of ~10 for a given stellar mass. Our
results thus indicate that the host subhalo mass of central and satellite
galaxies is poorly constrained by using information coming solely from the
abundance and CFs of galaxies. In addition, we demonstrate that the fraction of
stellar mass relative to the universal baryon fraction can vary between
different models, and can reach ~0.6 for a specific population of low mass
galaxies. We conclude that additional observational constraints are needed, in
order to better constrain the mass relation between haloes and galaxies. These

calculate the Jeans length of tidal streams by treating them as a thin
expanding cylinder of collisionless matter. We also find a general relation
between the density and the velocity dispersion inside a stream, which is used
to determine the longitudinal Jeans criterion. Our analytic results are checked
by following the time evolution of the phase space density within streams using
numerical simulations. We conclude that tidal streams within our galactic halo

cumulative number of luminous satellites at z = 0 is similar to the observed
system of satellites orbiting the Milky Way although an analysis of the
satellite mass function reveals an order of magnitude more dark satellites than
luminous. Some of the dark subhalos are more massive than some of the luminous
subhalos at z = 0. What separates luminous and dark subhalos is not their mass
at z = 0, but the maximum mass the subhalos ever achieve. We study the effect
of four mass loss mechanisms on the subhalos: ultraviolet (UV) ionising
radiation, ram pressure stripping, tidal stripping, and stellar feedback, and
compare the impact of each of these four mechanisms on the satellites. In the
lowest mass subhalos, UV is responsible for the majority of the baryonic mass
loss. Ram pressure stripping removes whatever mass remains from the low mass
satellites. More massive subhalos have deeper potential wells and retain more
mass during reionisation. However, as satellites pass near the centre of the
main halo, tidal forces cause significant mass loss from satellites of all
masses. Satellites that are tidally stripped from the outside can account for
the luminous satellites that are lower mass than some of the dark satellites.
Stellar feedback has the greatest impact on medium mass satellites that had
formed stars, but lost all their gas by z = 0. Our results demonstrate that the
missing satellite problem is not an intractable issue with the cold dark matter
cosmology, but is rather a manifestation of baryonic processes.

precision unification. We also briefly consider scenarios in which SUSY is

instantaneous SNRs with the thresholds to determine whether and how many bits

the population lives along a line (e.g., a road or a river). If facilities are
optimally placed, the length of the line segment served by a facility is
inversely proportional to the square root of the population density. This

projections are obtained by multiplying $x$ by a matrix $\Phi \in {\mathbb

we ask the following question: given the triplet $\{k, m, n \}$ that defines
the CS problem size, what are the deterministic limits on the performance of
the best CS matrix in ${\mathbb R}^{m \times n}$? We select Restricted Isometry
as the performance metric. We derive two deterministic converse bounds and one
deterministic achievable bound on the Restricted Isometry for matrices in
${\mathbb R}^{m \times n}$ in terms of $n$, $m$ and $k$. The first converse
bound (structural bound) is derived by exploiting the intricate relationships
between the singular values of sub-matrices and the complete matrix. The second
converse bound (packing bound) and the achievable bound (covering bound) are
derived by recognizing the equivalence of CS matrices to codes on Grassmannian
spaces. Simulations reveal that random Gaussian $\Phi$ provide far from optimal
performance. The derivation of the three bounds offers several new geometric
insights that relate optimal CS matrices to equi-angular tight frames, the
Welch bound, codes on Grassmannian spaces, and the Generalized Pythagorean

investigated in the asymptotic long-time limit. Starting from a general and
analytically solvable decoherence model which does not involve any
weak-coupling or Markovian assumption it is shown that two fundamentally
different classes of entangled states can be distinguished. Quantum states of
the first class are fragile against decoherence so that they can be
disentangled asymptotically even if coherences between pointer states are still
present. Quantum states of the second type are robust against decoherence.
Asymptotically they can be disentangled only if also decoherence is perfect. A
simple criterion for identifying these two classes on the basis of two-qubit
entanglement is presented.

given for 1D spin systems in [X. Chen, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. B

representations of the symmetry group which can be viewed as a symmetry
fractionalization. In this paper, we extend the classification of 1D gapped
phases by considering SPT phases with combined time reversal, parity, and/or
on-site unitary symmetries and also the possibility of symmetry breaking. We
clarify how symmetry fractionalizes with combined symmetries and also how
symmetry fractionalization coexists with symmetry breaking.
  In this way, we obtain a complete classification of gapped quantum phases in
1D spin systems. We find that in general, symmetry fractionalization, symmetry
breaking and long range entanglement(present in 2 or higher dimensions)
represent three main mechanisms to generate a very rich set of gapped quantum

The criteria thus apply to multisite qudits, i.e., systems of fixed dimension

that test local hidden variables (Bell inequalities) can be violated for
arbitrary d by optimized highly correlated nonmaximally entangled states
provided the number of sites N is high enough. On the other hand, the spin
inequalities for entanglement are violated and thus detect entanglement for
such states, for arbitrary d and N, and with a violation that increases with
N.We show that one of the moment entanglement inequalities can detect the
entanglement of an arbitrary generalized multipartite
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Because they involve the natural observables

self-interactions, so each of the two types of peakon solutions moves only
under the induced velocity of the other type. We analyse the `waltzing'

does not. Special relativistic effects do not allow stable, circular orbits in
presence of a force which is proportional to the negative of the displacement
of the particle from the potential center.

multimedia applications such as voice and broadband video transmissions over
IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Obviously, over a Wi-Fi link
and to better serve these applications - which normally have strict bounded
transmission delay or minimum link rate requirement - a service differentiation
technique can be applied to the media traffic transmitted by the same mobile
node using the well-known 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)
protocol. However, the given EDCA mode does not offer user differentiation,
which can be viewed as a deficiency in multi-access wireless networks.
Accordingly, we propose a new inter-node priority access scheme for IEEE
802.11e networks which is compatible with the EDCA scheme. The proposed scheme
joins a dynamic user-weight to each mobile station depending on its outgoing
data, and therefore deploys inter-node priority for the channel access to
complement the existing EDCA inter-frame priority. This provides efficient
quality of service control across multiple users within the same coverage area
of an access point. We provide performance evaluations to compare the proposed
access model with the basic EDCA 802.11 MAC protocol mode to elucidate the
quality improvement achieved for multimedia communication over 802.11 WLANs.

high-field pulsars and magnetars, resonant Compton upscattering is anticipated
to be the most efficient process for generating continuum radiation. This is
due in part to the proximity of a hot soft photon bath from the stellar surface
to putative radiation dissipation regions in the inner magnetosphere. Moreover,
because the scattering process becomes resonant at the cyclotron frequency, the
effective cross section exceeds the classical Thomson value by over two orders
of magnitude, thereby enhancing the efficiency of continuum production and the
cooling of relativistic electrons. This paper presents computations of the
electron cooling rates for this process, which are needed for resonant Compton
models of non-thermal radiation from such highly-magnetized pulsars. The
computed rates extend previous calculations of magnetic Thomson cooling to the
domain of relativistic quantum effects, sampled near and above the quantum
critical magnetic field of 44.13 TeraGauss. This is the first exposition of
fully relativistic, quantum magnetic Compton cooling rates for electrons, and
it employs both the traditional Johnson and Lippman cross section, and a newer
Sokolov and Ternov (ST) formulation of Compton scattering in strong magnetic
fields. Such ST formalism is formally correct for treating spin-dependent
effects that are important in the cyclotron resonance, and has not been
addressed before in the context of cooling by Compton scattering. The QED
effects are observed to profoundly lower the rates below extrapolations of the
familiar magnetic Thomson results, as expected, when recoil and Klein-Nishina
reductions become important.

problems and complications that have not yet been appreciated. Using
high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESO/MPG 2.2\,m telescope in La Silla
and following the premises of the Walborn and Conti classification schemes, we
determined the spectral types and luminosity classes of 19 Galactic O-type
stars and compared them to those attributed by Walborn and Mathys based on
low-quality data. Our analysis reveals that the morphological spectral types
assigned using high-resolution data are systematically later (by up to 1.5
subtypes) then those attributed by Walborn. By means of line-profile
simulations, we show that part of this discrepancy is more likely caused by the
combined effect of stellar rotation and high spectral resolution on the depth
of helium lines used as spectral type indicators. In addition, we demonstrate
that at least for narrow-lined stars the ""rotational effect"" does not disappear
when the high-resolution spectra are degraded to the resolution of the Walborn
standards. We also find evidence of a systematic difference between our
high-resolution quantitative spectral types and those assigned by Mathys.
Rotation and spectral resolution are important third parameters in the spectral
classification of O-type stars. To obtain reliable spectral classes within the
Walborn approach, the unknown and the standard spectra must be compared at the
same resolution and \vsini. Owing to resolution effects, the Conti approach
might also need to be updated.

orthorhombic transition accompanied by remarkable softening of shear modulus,
(ii) high-Tc superconductivity close to the orthorhombic phase, and (iii)
stripe-type magnetic order induced by orthorhombicity. To present a unified
explanation for them, we analyze the multiorbital Hubbard-Holstein model with
Fe-ion optical phonons based on the orbital fluctuation theory. In the
random-phase-approximation (RPA), a small electron-phonon coupling constant
($\lambda ~ 0.2$) is enough to produce large orbital (=charge quadrupole)
fluctuations. The most divergent susceptibility is the
$O_{xz}$-antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) susceptibility, which causes the s-wave
superconductivity without sign reversal (s_{++}-wave state). At the same time,
divergent development of $O_{x2-y2}$-ferro-quadrupole (FQ) susceptibility is
brought by the ""two-orbiton process"" with respect to the AFQ fluctuations,
which is absent in the RPA. The derived FQ fluctuations cause the softening of
$C_{66}$ shear modulus, and its long-range-order not only triggers the
orthorhombic structure transition, but also induces the instability of
stripe-type antiferro-magnetic state. In other words, the condensation of
composite bosons made of two orbitons gives rise to the FQ order and structure
transition. The theoretically predicted multi-orbital-criticality presents a
unified explanation for abovementioned features of iron pnictide
superconductors.

that accurately predicts arbitrary posterior shapes. The Box-Cox

multivariate Gaussian, performing the Fisher matrix calculation on the

predicts changes in the posterior when varying various parameters of the

cost than a standard Fisher matrix calculation. We apply the Box-Cox-Fisher

gravitational lensing surveys. The characteristic non-linear degeneracy between
matter density parameter and normalisation of matter density fluctuations is
reproduced for several cases, and the capabilities of breaking this degeneracy

using ancilla qubits with properly chosen single-qubit frequencies and with
properly designed coupling to the system qubits. The parameters used in the
simulation are easily derived from the parameters of the system+environment
Hamiltonian. The algorithm is designed to simulate Markovian dynamics, but it
can also be used to simulate non-Markovian dynamics provided that this dynamics
can be obtained by embedding the system of interest into a larger system that
obeys Markovian dynamics. We estimate the resource requirements for the
algorithm. In particular, we show that for sufficiently slow decoherence a

the varying performance of any routing algorithm depends on the underlying

maintenance of global network state by using statistics of flow blocking
probabilities. We developed a new network parameter that can be used to predict
which network topology gives better performance on the quality of localized QoS
routing algorithms. Using this parameter we explore a simple model that can be

has revealed several surprises. The starting point of this investigation was
the detection at the IRAM-30m telescope of molecular gas with very large line
splittings up to 260km/s within the beam (40 pc). In this region, which is
known for its low gas content, we also detect an ionised gas outflow in the
circumnuclear region (within 75pc from the centre) extending to the whole area
in X-ray. Relying on atomic, ionised, and molecular gas, we account for most
observables with a scenario that assumes that a few hundreds Myr ago, M31
underwent a frontal collision with M32, which triggered some star-formation
activity in the centre, and this collision explains the special configuration
of M31 with two rings observed at 0.7kpc and 10kpc. The inner disc (whose
rotation is detected in HI and ionised gas ([NII])) has thus been tilted
(inclination: 43deg, PA: 70deg) with respect to the main disc (inclination:
77deg, PA: 35deg). One of the CO velocity components is compatible with this
inner disc, while the second one comes from a tilted ring-like material with
40deg inclination and PA=-35deg. The relic star formation estimated by previous
works to have occurred more than 100Myr ago could have been triggered by the
collision and could be linked to the outflow detected in the ionised gas. Last,
we demonstrate that the amplitude of the line splittings detected in CO centred
on the systemic velocity with a relatively high spatial resolution (40pc)
cannot be accounted for by a possible weak bar that is roughly aligned along
the minor axis. Although M31 has a triaxial bulge, there are no bar indicators
in the gas component (photometry, no strong skewness of the isovelocities,
etc.).

There are numerous theories about theses oscillations. Here, we review a number
of them in order to draw a parallel between climatic concepts and dynamical
system concepts, including, in particular, the relaxation oscillator,
excitability, slow-fast dynamics and homoclinic orbits. Namely, almost all
theories of ice ages reviewed here feature a phenomenon of synchronisation
between internal climate dynamics and the astronomical forcing. However, these
theories differ in their bifurcation structure and this has an effect on the
way the ice age phenomenon could grow 3 million years ago. All theories on
rapid events reviewed here rely on the concept of a limit cycle in the ocean
circulation, which may be excited by changes in the surface freshwater surface
balance. The article also reviews basic effects of stochastic fluctuations on
these models, including the phenomenon of phase dispersion, shortening of the
limit cycle and stochastic resonance. It concludes with a more personal
statement about the potential for inference with simple stochastic dynamical
systems in palaeoclimate science.

associated with the region are identified on the basis of near-infrared and
mid-infrared observations. We confirmed our earlier results that the average
age of the YSOs lying on/inside the rim are younger than those lying outside
the rim. The global distribution of the YSOs shows an aligned distribution from
the ionising source to the BRCs. These facts indicate that a series of
radiation driven implosion processes proceeded from near the central ionising
source towards the periphery of the W5 E H{\sc ii} region. We found that, in
general, the age distributions of the Class II and Class III sources are the
same. This result is apparently in contradiction with the conclusion by
Bertout, Siess & Cabrit (2007) and Chauhan et al. (2009) that classical T Tauri
stars evolve to weak-line T Tauri stars. The initial mass function of the
central cluster region in the mass range $0.4 \le M/M_\odot \le 30$ can be
represented by $\Gamma = -1.29 \pm 0.03$. The cumulative mass functions

temperature Tc with pressures up to 4.5 GPa, followed by decrease of Tc on
further increase of pressure and finally its disappearance, in agreement with
the Doniach model. We infer a ferromagnetic quantum critical point around 7 GPa
under hydrostatic pressure conditions from the extrapolation to 0 K of Tc and
the maximum of the A coefficient from low temperature fits of the resistivity
\rho (T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}. No superconductivity under pressure was observed down
to 0.35 K for this compound. In addition, differences in the Tc(P) behavior
when a slight uniaxial component is present are noticed and discussed and
correlated to choice of pressure medium.

break time reversal symmetry in the presence of band hybridization. We also
present a theoretical model to account for the altered surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$.

early-type galaxies. Dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that mass
follows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systems
of similar velocity dispersions. Instead, dynamical fits with dark matter halos
are in good agreement with lensing results. We derive mass-to-light ratios of
the stellar populations from Lick absorption line indices, reproducing well the
observed galaxy colours. Even in dynamical models with dark matter halos the
amount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with galaxy
velocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function
(IMF). While galaxies around sigma ~ 200 km/s are consistent with a Kroupa IMF,
the same IMF underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigma ~
300 km/s by a factor of two and more. A systematic variation of the stellar IMF
with galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a Salpeter IMF
for the most massive galaxies. If the IMF is instead constant, then some of the
dark matter in high velocity dispersion galaxies must follow a spatial
distribution very similar to that of the light. A combination of both, a
varying IMF and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possible
as well. For a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations we show that
the tilt in the fundamental plane can be explained by systematic variations of
the total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius. We tested commonly
used mass estimator formulae, finding them accurate at the 20-30% level.

The need for these pixels in the algorithm comes from the need of building a
network of nodes for the path, where each node represents a turning in the real

ignores from finding the center pixels paths that are too small for intelligent

IceCube has already reached a sensitivity to observe neutrinos produced in
temporal coincidence with individual GRBs provided that they are the sources of
the observed extragalactic cosmic rays. We here point out that the GRB origin
of cosmic rays is also challenged by the IceCube upper limit on a possible
diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos which should not be exceeded by the flux
produced by all GRB over Hubble time. Our alternative approach has the
advantage of directly relating the diffuse flux produced by all GRBs to
measurements of the cosmic ray flux. It also generates both the neutrino flux

duality associates to every region a Hamiltonian on its boundary, in such a way
that the entanglement spectrum of the bulk corresponds to the excitation

deformed AKLT [1], an Ising-type [2], and Kitaev's toric code [3], both in

local order corresponds to a boundary Hamiltonian with local interactions,
whereas critical behavior in the bulk is reflected on a diverging interaction
length of the boundary Hamiltonian. Furthermore, topologically ordered states
yield non-local Hamiltonians. As our duality also associates a boundary
operator to any operator in the bulk, it in fact provides a full holographic

level flight, we successfully detected 420 downward gamma rays between 100 keV
and 1 MeV at zenith angles below 60 degrees. To obtain the flux of diffuse
cosmic gamma rays, we first simulated their scattering in the atmosphere using
Geant4, and for gamma rays detected at an atmospheric depth of 7.0 g cm-2, we
found that 50% and 21% of the gamma rays at energies of 150 keV and 1 MeV,

model, we estimated that the detected events consisted of diffuse cosmic and
atmospheric gamma rays (79%), secondary photons produced in the instrument
through the interaction between cosmic rays and materials surrounding the
detector (19%), and other particles (2%). The obtained growth curve was
comparable to Ling's model, and the fluxes of diffuse cosmic and atmospheric

length. We demonstrate that the mere definition of the holographic dark-energy
density generally implies an interaction with the dark-matter component. We
discuss the relation between the equation-of-state parameter and the energy
density ratio of both components for each of the choices, as well as the
possibility of non-interacting and scaling solutions. Parameter estimations for
all three cutoff options are performed with the help of a Bayesian statistical

Criterion ($AIC$), however, we find $\Delta AIC$ $< 2$ for models with
