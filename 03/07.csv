change management, product structure management, project tracking and resource
planning. Though PDM is heavily benefiting industry but PDM community is facing
a very serious unresolved issue in PDM system development with flexible and
user friendly graphical user interface for efficient human machine
communication. PDM systems offer different services and functionalities at a
time but the graphical user interfaces of most of the PDM systems are not
designed in a way that a user (especially a new user) can easily learn and use
them. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in field of Human
Computer Interaction; resultant data provides the information about graphical
user interface development using rich internet applications. The accomplished
goal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a proposition of a
conceptual model for the implementation of a flexible web based graphical user
interface. The proposed conceptual model was successfully designed into
implementation model and a resultant prototype putting values to the field is
now available. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept,
implementation designs and developed prototype is also discussed in this paper.
Moreover in the end, prototype is compared with respective functions of
existing PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness

GRB rest frames and it uses a sample of 62 long GRBs from our sample of 77
Swift GRBs with known redshifts. Following the earlier analysis of the
afterglow {\it characteristic luminosity $L^*_a$ -- break time $T^*_a$}
correlation for a sample of long GRBs \citep{Dainotti2010} we extend it to
correlations between the afterglow and the prompt emission GRB physical
parameters. We reveal a tight physical scaling between the mentioned afterglow
luminosity $ L^*_a$ and the prompt emission {\it mean} luminosity $<L^*_p>_{45}
\equiv E_{iso}/T^*_{45}$. The distribution, with the Spearman correlation
coefficient reaching 0.95 for the data subsample with most regular light
curves, can be fitted with approximately $L^*_a \propto {<L^*_p>_{45}}^{0.7}$.
We also analyzed correlations of $L^*_a$ with several other prompt emission
parameters, including the isotropic energy $E_{iso}$, the peak energy in the
$\nu F_{\nu}$ spectrum, $E_{peak}$, and the variability parameter, $V$, defined
by \cite{N000}. As a result, we reveal significant correlations also between
these quantities, with an exception of the variability parameter. The main
result of the present study is the discovery that the highest correlated GRB
subsample in the \citet{Dainotti2010} afterglow analysis, for the GRBs with
canonical X\,-\,ray light curves, leads also to the highest {\it

description of an unstable system and the theory of coupling to an environment.
According to the Wigner-Weisskopf general approach, even within the pole
approximation (neglecting the background contribution) the evolution of a total
system subspace is not an exact semigroup for the multi-channel decay, unless
the projectors into eigesntates of the reduced evolution generator $W(z)$ are
orthogonal. In this case these projectors must be evaluated at different pole
locations $z_\alpha\neq z_\beta$. Since the orthogonality relation does not
generally hold at different values of $z$, for example, when there is symmetry
breaking, the semigroup evolution is a poor approximation for the multi-channel
decay, even for a very weak coupling. Nevertheless, there exists a possibility
not only to ensure the orthogonality of the $W(z)$ projectors regardless the
number of the poles, but also to simultaneously suppress the effect of the
background contribution. This possibility arises when the theory is generalized
to take into account interactions with an environment. In this case $W(z)$, and
hence its eigenvectors as well, are {\it independent} of $z$, which corresponds
to a structure of the coupling to the continuum spectrum associated with the
Markovian limit.

random medium made of atomic electric dipoles. First, we evaluate the
contribution of statistical fluctuations to the average total vacuum energy,
which is made out of the integration of the variations of the Lamb shift with
respect to the coupling constant. While the Lamb shift is a function of the
electrical susceptibility only, the vacuum energy is generally not. Second, we
make clear why the effective medium bulk energy does not account for the total
vacuum energy of a molecular dielectric. Consequently, the Lamb shift does not
derive from the effective medium bulk energy except at leading order in the
molecular density. The local field factors provide natural cutoffs for the
spectrum of the total vacuum energy at a wavelength of the order of the
correlation length. Third, we investigate to what extent shifts in the spectrum
of the dielectric constant may be attributed to the binding energy of a
dielectric. In particular, in the continuum approximation we have found a
relation between the electrostatic binding energy and the Lorentz-Lorenz shift.
Nonetheless, we conclude that the knowledge of the spectrum of the refractive
index is insufficient either to quantify the energy of radiative modes or to
estimate the electrostatic binding energy of molecular clusters.

Our main theorem allows to reduce a proof of multiplicity lemma to the study of
ideals stable under some appropriate transformation of a polynomial ring. In
particular, this result leads to a new link between the theory of polarized
algebraic dynamical systems and transcendental number theory. On the other
hand, it allows to establish an improvement of Nesterenko's conditional result
on solutions of systems of differential equations. We also deduce, under some
condition on stable varieties, the optimal multiplicity estimate in the case of
generalized Mahler's functional equations, previously studied by Mahler,
Nishioka, Topfer and others. Further, analyzing stable ideals we prove the
unconditional optimal result in the case of linear functional systems of
generalized Mahler's type. The latter result generalizes a famous theorem of
Nishioka (1986) previously conjectured by Mahler (1969), and simultaneously it
gives a counterpart in the case of functional systems for an important
unconditional result of Nesterenko (1977) concerning linear differential
systems. In summary, we provide a new universal tool for transcendental number
theory, applicable with fields of any characteristic. It opens the way to new
results on algebraic independence, as shown in Zorin (2010).

path integrals on the three-sphere can be calculated using the method of

R-charges of the matter fields. We solve a number of such large N matrix models
and calculate the free energy F as a function of the trial R-charges consistent
with the marginality of the superpotential. In all our {\cal N}=2
superconformal examples, the local maximization of F yields answers that scale
as N^{3/2} and agree with the dual M-theory backgrounds AdS_4 x Y, where Y are
7-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein spaces. We also find in toric examples that local
F-maximization is equivalent to the minimization of the volume of Y over the

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:0904.0855",,,,"math.NA math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developments in dynamical systems theory provides new support for the
macroscale modelling of pdes and other microscale systems such as Lattice
Boltzmann, Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators. By systematically
resolving subgrid microscale dynamics the dynamical systems approach constructs
accurate closures of macroscale discretisations of the microscale system. Here
we specifically explore reaction-diffusion problems in two spatial dimensions
as a prototype of generic systems in multiple dimensions. Our approach unifies
into one the modelling of systems by a type of finite elements, and the
`equation free' macroscale modelling of microscale simulators efficiently
executing only on small patches of the spatial domain. Centre manifold theory
ensures that a closed model exist on the macroscale grid, is emergent, and is
systematically approximated. Dividing space either into overlapping finite
elements or into spatially separated small patches, the specially crafted
inter-element/patch coupling also ensures that the constructed discretisations
are consistent with the microscale system/PDE to as high an order as desired.
Computer algebra handles the considerable algebraic details as seen in the
specific application to the Ginzburg--Landau PDE. However, higher order models
in multiple dimensions require a mixed numerical and algebraic approach that is
also developed. The modelling here may be straightforwardly adapted to a wide
class of reaction-diffusion PDEs and lattice equations in multiple space
dimensions. When applied to patches of microscopic simulations our coupling
conditions promise efficient macroscale simulation.

Using the rate of accretion of a protostar from its natal core as a free
parameter, we demonstrate its quintessential role in determining the shape of
the IMF. By varying the rate of accretion, we show that a stellar mass
distribution similar to the universal IMF could possibly be generated starting
from either a typical CMF such as the one for the OMC, or a uniform
distribution of prestellar core masses which leads us to suggest, the apparent
similarity in shapes of the CMF and the IMF is perhaps, only incidental. The
apodosis of the argument being, complex physical processes leading to stellar
birth are crucial in determining the final stellar masses, and consequently,
the shape of stellar mass distribution. This work entails partial Monte-Carlo
treatment of the problem, and starting with a randomly picked sample of cores,
and on the basis of classical arguments which include protostellar feedback and
cooling due to emission from warm dust, a theoretical distribution of stellar
masses is derived for five realisations of the problem; the magnetic field,

(FoM) approach to probe any deviations from general relativity (GR) at
cosmological scales. The FoM approach is used to study the constraining power
of various combinations of data sets on modified gravity (MG) parameters. We
use recently refined HST-COSMOS weak-lensing tomography data, ISW-galaxy cross
correlations from 2MASS and SDSS LRG surveys, matter power spectrum from
SDSS-DR7 (MPK), WMAP7 temperature and polarization spectra, BAO from 2DF and
SDSS-DR7, and Union2 compilation of supernovae, in addition to other bounds
from H_0 measurements and BBN. We use 3 parametrizations of MG parameters that
enter the perturbed field equations. In order to allow for variations with
redshift and scale, the first 2 parametrizations use recently suggested
functional forms while the third is based on binning methods. Using the first
parametrization, we find that CMB + ISW + WL provides the strongest constraints
on MG parameters followed by CMB+WL or CMB+MPK+ISW. Using the second
parametrization or binning methods, CMB+MPK+ISW consistently provides some of
the strongest constraints. This shows that the constraints are parametrization
dependent. We find that adding up current data sets does not improve
consistently uncertainties on MG parameters due to tensions between best-fit MG
parameters preferred by different data sets. Furthermore, some functional forms
imposed by the parametrizations can lead to an exacerbation of these tensions.
Next, unlike some studies that used the CFHTLS lensing data, we do not find any
deviation from GR using the refined HST-COSMOS data, confirming previous claims
in those studies that their result may have been due to some systematic effect.
Finally, we find in all cases that the values corresponding to GR are within
the 95% confidence level contours for all data set combinations. (abridged)

'quantized' in integer or half-integer multiples with respect to the parent
stars' rotation period. The Solar System is first shown to exhibit quantized
planetary orbits that correlate with the Sun's rotation period. The analysis is
then expanded over 443 exoplanets to statistically validate this quantization
and its association with stellar rotation. The results imply that the
exoplanetary orbital periods are highly correlated with the parent star's
rotation periods and follow a discrete half-integer relationship with orbital
ranks n=0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, etc. The probability of obtaining these

justify this planetary quantization, such as the hybrid gravitational
instability models of planet formation, along with possible physical mechanisms
such as inner discs magnetospheric truncation, tidal dissipation, and resonance

dimensional spin systems. Our analysis is based on the dynamical mechanism
which envisages nonadiabaticity in the vicinity of the critical point. This
causes spin fluctuation which leads to the random fluctuation of the Berry
phase factor acquired by a spin state when the ground state of the system
evolves in a closed path. The two-point correlation of this phase factor is
associated with the probability of the formation of defects. In this framework,
we have estimated the density of defects produced in several one dimensional
spin chains. At the critical region, the entanglement entropy of a block of $L$
spins with the rest of the system is also estimated which is found to increase
logarithmically with $L$. The dependence on the quench time puts a constraint
on the block size $L$. It is also pointed out that the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
model in point-splitting regularized form appears as a combination of the XXX
model and Ising model with magnetic field in the negative z-axis. This unveils
the underlying conformal symmetry at criticality which is lost in the sharp
point limit. Our analysis shows that the density of defects as well as the
scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy follows a universal behavior in
all these systems.

It is found that the stability condition for the trapped particle mode is more

to study the intracluster light (ICL) component, we measure the quantity of ICL
using a number of different methods previously employed in the literature for
both observational and simulation data sets. By measuring the ICL of the
clusters using multiple techniques, we identify systematic differences in how
each detection method identifies the ICL. We find that techniques which define
the ICL solely based on the current position of the cluster luminosity, such as
a surface brightness or local density threshold, tend to find less ICL than
methods utilizing time or velocity information, including stellar particles'
density history or binding energy. The range of ICL fractions (the fraction of
the clusters' total luminosity found in the ICL component) we measure at z=0
across all our clusters using any definition span the range from 9-36%, and
even within a single cluster different methods can change the measured ICL
fraction by up to a factor of two. Separating the cluster's central galaxy from
the surrounding ICL component is a challenge for all ICL techniques, and
because the ICL is centrally concentrated within the cluster, the differences
in the measured ICL quantity between techniques are largely a consequence of
this central galaxy/ICL separation. We thoroughly explore the free parameters
involved with each measurement method, and find that adjusting these parameters
can change the measured ICL fraction by up to a factor of two. While for all
definitions the quantity of ICL tends to increase with time, the ICL fraction
does not grow at a uniform rate, nor even monotonically under some definitions.
Thus, the ICL can be used as a rough indicator of dynamical age, where more
dynamically advanced clusters will on average have higher ICL fractions.

interactions is a promising method to measure the tiny flux of cosmogenic
neutrinos expected on Earth. The energy threshold for this process depends
strongly on the absolute noise level in the target material. The South Pole
Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS), deployed in the upper part of four boreholes of
the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, has monitored the noise in Antarctic ice at
the geographic South Pole for more than two years down to 500 m depth. The
noise is very stable and Gaussian distributed. Lacking an in-situ calibration
up to now, laboratory measurements have been used to estimate the absolute
noise level in the 10 to 50 kHz frequency range to be smaller than 20 mPa.
Using a threshold trigger, sensors of the South Pole Acoustic Test Setup
registered acoustic pulse-like events in the IceCube detector volume and its
vicinity. Acoustic signals from refreezing IceCube holes and from anthropogenic
sources have been used to localize acoustic events. Monte Carlo simulations of
sound propagating from the established sources to the SPATS sensors have
allowed to check corresponding model expectations. An upper limit on the
neutrino flux at energies $E_\nu > 10^{11}$ GeV is derived from acoustic data
taken over eight months.

of the mapping F we mean mdeg F=(deg F_1,...,deg F_n), an element of N^n.
  The aim of this paper is to study the following problem (especially for n=3):
for which sequence (d_1,...,d_n) in N^n there is a tame automorphism F of C^n
such that mdeg F=(d_1,...,d_n). In other words we investigate the set
mdeg(Tame(C^n)), where Tame(C^n) denotes the group of tame automorphisms of C^n
and mdeg denotes the mapping from the set of polynomial endomorphisms of C^n
into the set N^n.
  Since for all permutation s of {1,...,n} we have (d_1,...,d_n) is in
mdeg(Tame(C^n)) if and only if (d_s(1),...,d_s(n)) is in mdeg(Tame(C^n)) we may
focus on the set mdeg(Tame(C^n)) intersected with {(d_1,...,d_n) :
d_1<=...<=d_n}.
  In the paper, among other things, we give complete description of the sets:
mdeg(Tame(C^n)) intersected with {(3,d_2,d_3):3<=d_2<=d_3}}, mdeg(Tame(C^n))
intersected with {(5,d_2,d_3):5<=d_2<=d_3}}, In the examination of the last set
the most difficult part is to prove that (5,6,9) is not in mdeg(Tame(C^n)).
  As a surprising consequence of the method used in proving that (5,6,9) is not
in mdeg(Tame(C^n)), we obtain the result saying that the existence of tame
automorphism F of C^3 with mdeg F=(37,70,105) implies that two dimensional
Jacobian Conjecture is not true.
  Also, we give the complete description of the following sets: mdeg(Tame(C^n))
intersected with {(p_1,p_2,d_3):3<=p_1<p_2<=d_3}}, where p_1 and p_2 are prime
numbers, mdeg(Tame(C^n)) intersected with {(d_1,d_2,d_3):d_1<p_2<=d_3}}, where
d_1 and d_2 are odd numbers such that gcd(d_1,d_2)=1. Using description of the
last set we show that the set mdeg(Aute(C^n))\mdeg(Tame(C^n)) is infinite.

Treasury Survey, we determine colour profiles of early-type galaxies in the
Coma cluster. From 176 galaxies brighter than $M_\mathrm{F814W(AB)} = -15$ mag
that are either spectroscopically confirmed members of Coma or identified by
eye as likely members from their low surface brightness, data are provided for
142 early-type galaxies. Typically, colour profiles are linear against
$\log(R)$, sometimes with a nuclear region of distinct, often bluer colour
associated with nuclear clusters. Colour gradients are determined for the
regions outside the nuclear components. We find that almost all colour
gradients are negative, both for elliptical and lenticular galaxies. Most
likely, earlier studies that report positive colour gradients in dwarf galaxies
are affected by the bluer colours of the nuclear clusters, underlining that
high resolution data are essential to disentangle the colour properties of the
different morphological components in galaxies. Colour gradients of dwarf
galaxies form a continuous sequence with those of elliptical galaxies, becoming
shallower toward fainter magnitudes. Interpreting the colours as metallicity
tracers, our data suggest that dwarfs as well as giant early-type galaxies in
the Coma cluster are less metal rich in their outer parts. We do not find
evidence for environmental influence on the gradients, although we note that
most of our galaxies are found in the central regions of the cluster. For a
subset of galaxies with known morphological types, S0 galaxies have less steep
gradients than elliptical galaxies.

possesses general validity that goes beyond specific models. This is in marked

arbitrarily small amount of noise is enough to restore the scaling dictated by

smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation, and apply the method to simulations
of five primordial minihalos generated from cosmological initial conditions. We
find that accretion luminosity delays fragmentation within the halos, but does
not prevent it. In halos that slowly form a low number of protostars, the
accretion luminosity can reduce the number of fragments that are formed before
the protostars start ionising their surroundings. However, halos that rapidly
form many protostars become dominated by dynamical processes, and the effect of
accretion luminosity becomes negligible. Generally the fragmentation found in
the halos is highly dependent on the initial conditions. Accretion luminosity
does not substantially affect the accretion rates experienced by the
protostars, and is far less important than dynamical interactions, which can
lead to ejections that effectively terminate the accretion. We find that the
accretion rates onto the inner regions of the disks (20 AU) around the
protostars are highly variable, in contrast to the constant or smoothly
decreasing accretion rates currently used in models of the pre-main sequence
evolution of Population III stars.

highly compressed integers. Using this new data structure it has been shown
recently by Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won that the Word Problem of the one-relator
Baumslag group is in P. Before that the best known upper bound has been
non-elementary. In the present paper we provide new results for power circuits
and we give new applications in algorithmic algebra and algorithmic group
theory: 1. We define a modified reduction procedure on power circuits which
runs in quadratic time thereby improving the known cubic time complexity. The
improvement is crucial for our other results. 2. We improve the complexity of
the Word Problem for the Baumslag group to cubic time thereby providing the
first practical algorithm for that problem. 3. The main result is that the Word
Problem of Higman's group is decidable in polynomial time. The situation for
Higman's group is more complicated than for the Baumslag group and forced us to
advance the theory of power circuits.

analysis reports an upper limit of ~6x10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the energy range
20-80 keV for the nonthermal flux with an average gas temperature of 8.45+-0.06

without including systematic effects, for an average XMM-Newton temperature of
8.2 keV in the Suzaku/HXD-PIN FOV, in agreement with our earlier PDS analysis.

smaller size of the HXD-PIN FOV and the two different average temperatures

for this reason, several techniques for extracting Web data have been suggested
during last years. Often, extraction tasks are performed through so called
wrappers, procedures extracting information from Web pages, e.g. implementing
logic-based techniques. Many fields of application today require a strong
degree of robustness of wrappers, in order not to compromise assets of
information or reliability of data extracted. Unfortunately, wrappers may fail
in the task of extracting data from a Web page, if its structure changes,
sometimes even slightly, thus requiring the exploiting of new techniques to be
automatically held so as to adapt the wrapper to the new structure of the page,
in case of failure. In this work we present a novel approach of automatic
wrapper adaptation based on the measurement of similarity of trees through
improved tree edit distance matching techniques.

together with simultaneous/contemporaneous RXTE data. These include three disc
dominated and two soft intermediate spectra, and the combination of broad
bandpass/moderate spectral resolution gives some of the best data on these
bright soft states in black hole binaries. The disc dominated spectra span a
factor three in luminosity, and all show that the disc emission is broader than
the simplest multicolour disc model. This is consistent with the expected
relativistic smearing and changing colour temperature correction produced by
atomic features in the newest disc models. However, these models do not match
the data at the 5 per cent level as the predicted atomic features are not
present in the data, perhaps indicating that irradiation is important even when
the high energy tail is weak. Whatever the reason, this means that the data
have smaller errors than the best physical disc models, forcing use of more
phenomenological models for the disc emission. We use these for the soft
intermediate state data, where previous analysis using a simple disc continuum
found an extremely broad residual, identified as the red wing of the iron line
from reflection around a highly spinning black hole. However, the iron line
energy is close to where the disc and tail have equal fluxes, so using a
broader disc continuum changes the residual 'iron line' profile dramatically.
With a broader disc continuum model, the inferred line is formed outside of 30
${\rm{R_g}}$, so cannot constrain black hole spin. We caution that a robust
determination of black hole spin from the iron line profile is very difficult
where the disc makes a significant contribution at the iron line energy i.e. in
most bright black hole states.

measured at the Tevatron, is probably related to the contribution of new

standard model prediction and motivates the application of alternative models
introducing new states.
  However, as the standard model predictions for the total cross section
$\sigma_{tt}$ and invariant mass distribution $M_{tt}$ for this process are in
good agreement with experiments, any alternative model must reproduce these
predictions. These models can be placed into two categories: One introduces the
s-channel exchange of new vector bosons with chiral couplings to the light
quarks and to the top quark and another relies on the t-channel exchange of
particles with large flavor-violating couplings in the quark sector. In this
work we employ a model which introduces both s- and t-channel nonstandard
contributions for the top quark pair production in proton antiproton
collisions. We use the minimal version of the $SU(3)_C \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes
U (1)_X$ model (3-3-1 model) that predicts the existence of a new neutral gauge
boson, called $Z^\prime$. This gauge boson has both flavor-changing couplings
to up and top quarks and chiral coupling to the light quarks and to the top
quark. This very peculiar model coupling can correct the $A_{FB}$ for top quark
pair production for two ranges of $Z^\prime$ mass while leading to cross
section and invariant mass distribution quite similar to the standard model
ones. This result reinforces the role of the 3-3-1 model for any new physics

s-channel contributions for the elementary process of bilepton scalar pair
production, and to keep the correct unitarity behavior for the elementary $q

vector-bilepton pair production calculation. We explore a mass range for
$Z^\prime$ and we fix the exotic quark mass within the experimental bounds. In
this model, the vector-bilepton mass is directly related to $M_{Z^\prime}$ and
we consider scalar mass values around the vector-bilepton mass.

delta function transport distribution (or transmission in the Landauer
framework) maximizes the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, is revisited.
Thermoelectric (TE) performance is evaluated using a simple tight binding (TB)
model for electron dispersion and three different scattering models: 1) a
constant scattering time, 2) a constant mean-free-path, and 3) a scattering
rate proportional to the density-of-states. We found that a Dirac
delta-function transmission never produces the maximum ZT. The best
bandstructure for maximizing ZT depends on the scattering physics. These
results demonstrate that the selection of bandstructure to maximize TE
performance is more complex than previously thought and that a high
density-of-states near the band edge does not necessarily improve TE
performance.

the length, the s-system exhibits even-odd oscillations following a $a/x

filling and quantum confinement along the wire. The $sd$-system exhibits a
similar oscillation pattern, even in the presence of $sd$ hybridization. In

demonstrate that, as a consequence, his formulation might yield sub-optimal

  We attempt to characterize the radial distribution of dust in disks around a
sample of young stars from an observational point of view, and, when possible,
in a model-independent way, by using parametric laws.
  We used the IRAM PdBI interferometer to provide very high angular resolution
(down to 0.4"" in some sources) observations of the continuum at 1.3 mm and 3 mm
around a sample of T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga region. The sample
includes single and multiple systems, with a total of 23 individual disks. We
used track-sharing observing mode to minimize the biases. We fitted these data
with two kinds of models: a ""truncated power law"" model and a model presenting
an exponential decay at the disk edge (""viscous"" model). ect evidence for tidal
truncation is found in the multiple systems. The temperature of the mm-emitting
dust is constrained in a few systems.
  Unambiguous evidence for large grains is obtained by resolving out disks with
very low values of the dust emissivity index Beta. In most disks that are
sufficiently resolved at two different wavelengths, we find a radial dependence
of Beta, which appears to increase from low values (as low as 0) at the center
to about 1.7 -- 2 at the disk edge. The same behavior could apply to all
studied disks. It introduces further ambiguities in interpreting the brightness
profile, because the regions with apparent Beta = 0 can also be interpreted as
being optically thick when their brightness temperature is high enough. Despite
the added uncertainty on the dust absorption coefficient, the characteristic
size of the disk appears to increase with a higher estimated star age.
  These results provide the first direct evidence of the radial dependence of
the grain size in proto-planetary disks.

we solve ab initio the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation with the full

obtained from the full calculations with corresponding results of an
independent-electron model, we come to the somewhat counterintuitive conclusion
that the single-particle picture breaks down at superstrong field strengths. We
explain this finding from the perspective of the so-called Kramers-Henneberger
frame, the reference frame of a free (classical) electron moving in the field.
The breakdown is tied to the fact that shake-up and shake-off processes cannot
be properly accounted for in commonly used independent-electron models. In
addition, we see evidence of a change from the multiphoton to the shake-off
ionization regime in the energy distributions of the electrons. From the
angular distribution it is apparent that correlation is an important factor
even in this regime.

Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals in a wide doping region under
different magnetic fields. For the overdoped sample, we find the clear evidence
for the presence of $T^2$ term in the data, which is absent both for the
underdoped and optimal doped samples, suggesting the presence of line nodes in
the energy gap of the overdoped samples. Moreover, the field induced electron
specific heat coefficient $\Delta\gamma(H)$ increases more quickly with the
field for the overdoped sample than the underdoped and optimal doped ones,
giving another support to our arguments. Our results suggest that the
superconducting gap(s) in the present system may have different structures
strongly depending on the doping regions.

many searches for unknown, isolated spinning neutron stars have been carried
out, there have been no previous searches for unknown sources in binary
systems. Since current search methods for unknown, isolated neutron stars are
already computationally limited, expanding the parameter space searched to
include binary systems is a formidable challenge. We present a new hierarchical
binary search method called TwoSpect, which exploits the periodic orbital
modulations of the continuous waves by searching for patterns in doubly
Fourier-transformed data. We will describe the TwoSpect search pipeline,
including its mitigation of detector noise variations and corrections for
Doppler frequency modulation caused by changing detector velocity. Tests on
Gaussian noise and on a set of simulated signals will be presented.

programming interface with an efficient utilization of the concurrent-computing
abilities provided by modern machines. But does this combination come with an
inherent cost? We evaluate the cost of concurrency by measuring the amount of
expensive synchronization that must be employed in an STM implementation that
ensures positive concurrency, i.e., allows for concurrent transaction
processing in some executions. We focus on two popular progress conditions that
provide positive concurrency: progressiveness and permissiveness. We show that
in permissive STMs, providing a very high degree of concurrency, a transaction
performs a linear number of expensive synchronization patterns with respect to
its read-set size. In contrast, progressive STMs provide a very small degree of
concurrency but, as we demonstrate, can be implemented using at most one
expensive synchronization pattern per transaction. However, we show that even
in progressive STMs, a transaction has to ""protect"" (e.g., by using locks or
strong synchronization primitives) a linear amount of data with respect to its
write-set size. Our results suggest that looking for high degrees of
concurrency in STM implementations may bring a considerable synchronization
cost.

which forecasts and observations are regarded as points inside a triangle.
Within the triangle, we define a continuous colour palette in which hue and
colour saturation are defined with reference to the observed climatology. In
contrast to current methods, forecast maps created with this colour scheme
convey all of the information present in each ternary forecast. The geometrical
interpretation is then extended to verification under quadratic scoring rules
(of which the Brier Score and the Ranked Probability Score are well--known
examples). Each scoring rule defines an associated triangle in which the square
roots of the score, the reliability, the uncertainty and the resolution all
have natural interpretations as root--mean--square distances. This leads to our
proposal for a Ternary Reliability Diagram in which data relating to
verification and calibration can be summarised. We illustrate these ideas with
data relating to seasonal forecasting of precipitation in South America,
including an example of nonlinear forecast calibration. Codes implementing
these ideas have been produced using the statistical software package R and are
available from the authors.

that the optical light behaves in a similar manner, long exposures of the field
would be relatively insensitive due to the accumulation of sky photons. A much
better way of detecting optical emission from J1819-1458 would then be to
observe with a high-speed optical camera simultaneously with radio
observations, and co-add only those optical frames coincident with the
dispersion-corrected radio bursts. We present the results of such a search,
using simultaneous ULTRACAM and Lovell Telescope observations. We find no
evidence for optical bursts in J1819-1458 at magnitudes brighter than i'=19.3
(5-sigma limit). This is nearly 3 magnitudes fainter than the previous burst
limit, which had no simultaneous radio observations.

We propose in this paper a novel approach based on the channel capacity to
avoid these simulations. The method allows to study the performance in terms of
spectrum efficiency of hierarchical and also classical modulations combined
with error correcting codes. Our method will be applied to the DVB-SH standard
which considers hierarchical modulation as an optional feature.

destination, an eavesdropper and a jammer relay is studied under two different
set of assumptions: (i) The jammer relay does not hear the source transmission,
and (ii) The jammer relay is causally given the source message. In both cases
the jammer relay assists the eavesdropper and aims to decrease the achievable
secrecy rates. The source, on the other hand, aims to increase it. To help the
eavesdropper, the jammer relay can use pure relaying and/or send interference.
Each of the problems is formulated as a two-player, non-cooperative, zero-sum
continuous game. Assuming Gaussian strategies at the source and the jammer
relay in the first problem, the Nash equilibrium is found and shown to be
achieved with mixed strategies in general. The optimal cumulative distribution
functions (cdf) for the source and the jammer relay that achieve the value of
the game, which is the Nash equilibrium secrecy rate, are found. For the second
problem, the Nash equilibrium solution is found and the results are compared to
the case when the jammer relay is not informed about the source message.

the waves of the electric and chiral charge densities coupled by the axial

electric quadrupole moment of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion

acquires additional negative charge. We point out that this electric quadrupole
deformation lifts the degeneracy between the elliptic flows of positive and

of the effect.

theory is developed, and a possible implementation in the form of multilayered
