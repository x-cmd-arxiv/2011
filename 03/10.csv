in 2009 and 2010 at centre-of-mass energies of 900 GeV and 7 TeV. Events were
selected using a minimum-bias trigger which required a charged particle in
scintillation counters on either side of the interaction point. Particle flows,
sensitive to the underlying event, are measured using clusters of energy in the
ATLAS calorimeters, taking advantage of their fine granularity. No Monte Carlo
generator used in this analysis can accurately describe the measurements. The
results are independent of those based on charged particles measured by the
ATLAS tracking systems and can be used to constrain the parameters of Monte
Carlo generators.

gas, a quantity that generally differs from the non-condensed fraction. The
idea is based on applying a spatially oscillating artificial gauge field to the
atoms. The response of the atoms to the gauge field can be read out either
mechanically from the deposited energy into the cloud, or optically from the
macroscopic optical properties of the atomic gas. The local nature of the
proposed scheme allows one to reconstruct the spatial profile of the superfluid
component; furthermore, the proposed method does not require having established
thermal equilibrium in the gas in the presence of the gauge field. The
theoretical description of the system is based on a generalization of the
Dum-Olshanii theory of artificial gauge fields to the interacting many-body
context. The efficiency of the proposed measurement scheme is assessed by means
of classical field numerical simulations. An explicit atomic level scheme
minimizing disturbing effects such as spontaneous emission and light-shifts is
proposed for Rb 87 atoms.

predominantly right-polarized, as opposed to the $\tau^+$ from the dominant
background $W^+ \to \tau^+\nu_\tau$, which are left-polarized, a number of
$H^+/W^+ \to \tau^+\nu_\tau$ discriminators have been proposed and studied in
the literature. We consider hadronic decays of the $\tau^\pm$, concentrating on
the dominant one-prong decay channel $\tau^\pm \to \rho^\pm \nu_\tau$. The
energy and $p_T$ of the charged prongs normalised to the corresponding
quantities of the $\rho^\pm$ are convenient variables which serve as $\tau^\pm$
polariser. We use the distributions in these variables and several other
kinematic quantities to train a boosted decision tree (BDT). Using the BDT
classifier, and a variant of it called BDTD, which makes use of decorrelated
variables, we have calculated the BDT(D)-response functions to estimate the
signal efficiency vs. the rejection of the background. We argue that this chain
of analysis has a high sensitivity to light charged Higgs searches up to a mass
of 150 GeV in the decays $t \to b H^+$ (and charge conjugate) at the LHC. For
the case of single top production, we also study the transverse mass of the

different realisations of an antilinear symmetry, as for instance PT-symmetry.
It is shown that the symmetry can be spontaneously broken in two alternative

the reality of the energies can be regained in some cases by a further breaking
of the symmetry on the level of the Hamiltonian. In many examples some of the
fixed points in the complex solution for the field undergo a Hopf bifurcation

orbital polarizations. These polarizations affect dramatically the Kondo
correlations occurring in quantum dots formed in a carbon nanotube, inducing
effective fields in both spin and orbital sectors. As a consequence, the carbon
nanotube quantum dot spectral density shows a four-fold split SU(4) Kondo
resonance. Furthermore, the presence of spin-orbit interactions leads to the
occurrence of an additional polarization among time-reversal electronic states
(polarization in the time-reversal symmetry or Kramers sector). Here, we
estimate the magnitude for the Kramer polarization in realistic carbon nanotube
samples and find that its contribution is comparable to the spin and orbital
polarizations. The Kramers polarization generates a new type of effective field
that affects only the time-reversal electronic states. We report new splittings
of the Kondo resonance in the dot spectral density which can be understood only
if Kramers polarization is taken into account. Importantly, we predict that the
existence of Kramers polarization can be experimentally detected by performing
nonlinear differential conductance measurements. We also find that, due to the
high symmetry required to build SU(4) Kondo correlations, its restoration by
applying an external field is not possible in contrast to the compensated SU(2)
Kondo state observed in conventional quantum dots.

This result is independent of the planet's embryo mass but is dependent on the
accretion rate in the disc. At high accretion rates, $\dot M \simgt
10^{-6}\msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryo is unable to contract quickly enough and is
disrupted. At late times, when the accretion rate drops to $\dot M \simlt
10^{-8} \msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryos migrate sufficiently slow to not be
disrupted. These ""late arrivals"" may explain the well known population of hot
jupiters. If type I migration regime is inefficient, then our model predicts a
pile-up of planets at $R\sim 0.1$ AU as the migration rate suddenly switches
from the type II to type I in that region.

nanoparticles are studied via a multiscale approach. Long space-time dynamics
is derived using a perturbation expansion in the ratio of the nearest-neighbor
distance to a nanometer-scale characteristic length, and a theorem on the
equivalence of long-time averages and expectation values. This dynamics is
shown to satisfy a coarse-grained wave equation (CGWE) which takes a
Schr\""odinger-like form with modified masses and interactions. The scaling of
space and time is determined by the orders of magnitude of various
contributions to the N-body potential. If the spatial scale of the
coarse-graining is too large, the CGWE would imply an unbounded growth of
gradients; if it is too short, the system's size would display uncontrolled
growth inappropriate for the bound states of interest, i.e., collective motion
or migration within a stable nano-assembly. The balance of these two extremes
removes arbitrariness in the choice of the scaling of space-time. Since the
long-scale dynamics of each fermion involves its interaction with many others,
we hypothesize that the solutions of the CGWE have mean-field character to good
approximation, i.e., can be factorized into single-particle functions. This
leads to a Coarse-grained Mean-field (CGMF) approximation that is distinct in
character from traditional Hartree-Fock theory. A variational principle is used
to derive equations for the single-particle functions. This theme is developed
and used to derive an equation for low-lying disturbances from the ground state
corresponding to long wavelength density disturbances or long-scale migration.
An algorithm for the efficient simulation of quantum nanosystems is suggested.

radial dependence, velocity distribution, and luminosity function of observed
secondaries exceptionally well, suggesting that LCDM provides an accurate
reproduction of the observed Universe to galaxies as faint as L~10^9 Lsun on
~50 kpc scales. When stacked, the observed projected pairwise velocity
dispersion of these satellites is sigma~160 km/s, in agreement with
abundance-matching expectations for their host halo masses. Finally, bright
satellites around L* primaries are significantly redder than typical galaxies
in their luminosity range, indicating that environmental quenching is operating
within galaxy-size dark matter halos that typically contain only a single

to be valid for the range of angular scales probed by most current weak-lensing
surveys, we show that the study of three generalized skewness parameters is
equivalent to the study of the three MFs defined in two dimensions. We then
extend these skewness parameters to three associated skew-spectra which carry
more information about the convergence bispectrum than their one-point
counterparts. We discuss various issues such as noise and incomplete sky
coverage in the context of estimation of these skew-spectra from realistic
data. Our technique provides an alternative to the pixel-space approaches
typically used in the estimation of MFs, and it can be particularly useful in
the presence of masks with non-trivial topology. Analytical modeling of weak
lensing statistics relies on an accurate modeling of the statistics of
underlying density distribution. We apply three different formalisms to model
the underlying dark-matter bispectrum: the hierarchical ansatz, halo model and
a fitting function based on numerical simulations; MFs resulting from each of
these formalisms are computed and compared. We investigate the extent to witch
late-time gravity-induced non-Gaussianity (to which weak lensing is primarily
sensitive) can be separated from primordial non-Gaussianity and how this
separation depends on source redshift and angular scale.

explosion we compute their further evolution and the distance travelled until a
Type II or Type Ibc SN or a long or short gamma-ray burst occurs. We find our
predicted population of OB runaway stars broadly matches the observed
population of stars but, to match the fastest observed WR runaway stars, we
require that black holes receive an asymmetric kick upon formation. We find
that at solar metallicity Type Ic SN progenitors travel shorter distances than
the progenitors of other SN types because they are typically more massive and
thus have shorter lifetimes. Those of Type IIP SN can fly farthest about 48 pc
on average at solar metallicity. In considering the consequences of assuming
that the progenitors of long GRBs are spun-up secondary stars that experience
quasi-homogeneous evolution, we find that such evolution has a dramatic effect
on the population of runaway WR stars and that some 30 per cent of GRBs could
occur a hundred parsecs or more from their initial positions. We also consider
mergers of double compact object binaries consisting of neutron stars and/or
black holes. We find the most common type of visible mergers are neutron

edges via a Constrained-Transport (CT) method. The multidimensional MHD source
terms required in the predictor step for high-order accuracy are applied in a
simplified form which reduces their complexity in three dimensions without loss
of accuracy or robustness. The algorithm is implemented on an AMR framework
which requires specific synchronization steps across refinement levels. These
include face-centered restriction and prolongation operations and a {\it
reflux-curl} operation, which maintains a solenoidal magnetic field across
refinement boundaries. The code is tested against a large suite of test
problems, including convergence tests in smooth flows, shock-tube tests,
classical two- and three-dimensional MHD tests, a three-dimensional shock-cloud
interaction problem and the formation of a cluster of galaxies in a fully
cosmological context. The magnetic field divergence is shown to remain
negligible throughout.

object, 2MASS 1207 b, several works have sought to explain a disparity between
its observed temperature and luminosity. Given its known age, distance, and
spectral type, 2MASS 1207 b is under-luminous by a factor of ~10 (~2.5 mags)
when compared to standard models of brown-dwarf/giant-planet evolution. In this
paper, we study three possible sources of 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity.
First, we investigate Mohanty et al. (2007)'s hypothesis that a near edge-on
disk might be responsible for 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. We conclude that
the hypothesis is unlikely due to the lack of variability seen in multi-epoch
photometry and unnecessary due to the increasing sample of under-luminous
brown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets that cannot be explained by an edge-on disk.
Next, we test the analogous possibility that a spherical shell of dust, could
explain 2MASS 1207 b's under-luminosity. Models containing enough dust to
create ~2.5 mags of extinction, placed at reasonable radii, are ruled out by
our new Gemini/T-ReCS 8.7 micron photometric upper-limit for 2MASS 1207 b.
Finally, we investigate the possibility that 2MASS 1207 b is intrinsically
cooler than the commonly used AMES-DUSTY fits to its spectrum, and thus it is
not, in fact, under-luminous. New, thick cloud model grids by Madhusudhan et
al. (2011) fit 2MASS 1207 b's 1-10 micron SED well, but they do not quite fit
its near-infrared spectrum. However, we suggest that with some ""tuning"", they
might be capable of simultaneously reproducing 2MASS 1207 b's spectral shape
and luminosity. In this case, the whole class of young, under-luminous
brown-dwarfs/giant-exoplanets might be explained by atmospheres that are able
to suspend thick, dusty clouds in their photospheres at lower temperatures than
field brown-dwarfs.

scales larger than the ion gyroradius. The rapid reconnection of magnetic flux
structures with dimensions vastly larger than the gyroradius requires a
breakdown in the standard Alfv\'en flux-freezing law. We attribute this
breakdown to ubiquitous MHD plasma turbulence with power-law scaling ranges of
velocity and magnetic energy spectra. Lagrangian particle trajectories in such
environments become ""spontaneously stochastic"", so that infinitely-many
magnetic field-lines are advected to each point and must be averaged to obtain
the resultant magnetic field. The relative distance between initial magnetic
field lines which arrive to the same final point depends upon the properties of
two-particle turbulent dispersion. We develop predictions based on the
phenomenological Goldreich & Sridhar theory of strong MHD turbulence and on
weak MHD turbulence theory. We recover the predictions of the Lazarian &
Vishniac theory for the reconnection rate of large-scale magnetic structures.
Lazarian & Vishniac also invoked ""spontaneous stochasticity"", but of the
field-lines rather than of the Lagrangian trajectories. More recent theories of
fast magnetic reconnection appeal to microscopic plasma processes that lead to
additional terms in the generalized Ohm's law, such as the collisionless Hall
term. We estimate quantitatively the effect of such processes on the
inertial-range turbulence dynamics and find them to be negligible in most
astrophysical environments. For example, the predictions of the
Lazarian-Vishniac theory are unchanged in Hall MHD turbulence with an extended
inertial range, whenever the ion skin depth $\delta_i$ is much smaller than the
turbulent integral length or injection-scale $L_i.$

result implies that systems covered or approximated by the model cannot have

against both thermal fluctuations and local perturbations simultaneously in two

configurational degrees of freedom of multi-centered BPS black hole solutions
in N=2 supergravity by localization methods. When the charges carried by the
centers do not allow for scaling solutions (i.e. solutions where a subset of
the centers can come arbitrarily close to each other), the phase space of
classical BPS solutions is compact and the refined index localizes to a finite
set of isolated fixed points under rotations, corresponding to collinear
solutions. When the charges allow for scaling solutions, the phase space is
non-compact but appears to admit a compactification with finite volume and
additional non-isolated fixed points. We give a prescription for determining
the contributions of these fixed submanifolds by means of a `minimal

singularity, which is a specific type of Landau singularity that can occur in
certain one-loop graphs in theories with massless particles. A simple formula
for the DPS singular part of a four-point diagram with arbitrary
internal/external particles is derived in terms of the transverse momentum
integral of a product of light cone wavefunctions with tree-level matrix
elements. This is used to reproduce and explain some results for DPS
singularities in box integrals that have been obtained using traditional loop

calculate the DPS singularity in loops with an arbitrary number of external

NMHV six-photon amplitudes often studied by the NLO multileg community are not
divergent at the DPS singular point, and point out that whilst all NMHV
amplitudes are always finite, certain MHV amplitudes do contain a DPS
divergence. It is shown that our framework for calculating DPS divergences in
loop diagrams is entirely consistent with the `two-parton GPD' framework of
Diehl and Schafer for calculating proton-proton DPS cross sections, but is
inconsistent with the `double PDF' framework of Snigirev.

Way does not represent a problem in cosmology but is due to the particular
geometry and dynamics of our local wall. The behavior of the perturbed Hubble
flow around the Milky Way is the result of two main factors: at small scales (R
< 1 Mpc) the inflow is dominated by the gravitational influence of the Milky
Way. At large scales (R > 1 Mpc) the out flow reflects the expansion of our
local wall which ""cools down"" the peculiar velocities. This is an intrinsic
property of walls and is independent of cosmology. We find the dispersion of
the local Hubble flow (1 < R < 3 Mpc) around simulated ""Milky Way"" haloes
located at the centre of low-density cosmological walls to be {\sigma}_H ~ 30
km/s, in excellent agreement with observations. The expansion of our local wall
is also reflected in the value of the measured local Hubble constant. For
""Milky Way"" haloes inside walls, we find super-Hubble flows with h_local \simeq
0.77 - 1.13. The radius of equilibrium (R_0) depends not only on the mass of
the central halo and the Hubble expansion but also on the dynamics given by the
local LSS geometry. The super-Hubble flow inside our local wall has the effect
of reducing the radius at which the local expansion balances the gravitational
influence of the Milky Way. By ignoring the dynamical effect of the local wall,
the mass of the Milky Way estimated from R_0 can be underestimated by as much

properties of both synthetic and biological macromolecules. Although intensely
studied for decades the interplay of many length scales has prevented a
complete resolution of some of the basic questions such as how the
electrostatic persistence length ($l_e$) varies with ionic strength ($I$). In
this review we describe certain characteristics of polyelectrolytes (PAs) and
polyampholytes (PAs), which are polymers whose monomers have a random
distribution of opposite charges. After reviewing the current theoretical
understanding of the dependence of $l_e$ on $I$ we present experimental data
that conform to two distinct behavior. For RNA and DNA it is found that that
$l_e \sim I^{-1}$ whereas for some proteins and other polyelectrolytes $l_e
\sim i^{-1/2}$. A scaling type theory, which delineates charge correlation and
pure polyelectrolyte effects for the shape of PAs that is valid over a wide
range of salt concentration is described. We also use theory and simulations to
argue that the distinct stages in the kinetics of collapse of PAs (with a net
charge that is small enough to induce globule formation) and PEs (relevant for
RNA folding) are similar. In both cases the major initial conformation change
involves formation of metastable pearl-necklace structures. In the coarsening
process large clusters (pearls) grow at the expense of smaller ones by a
process that is reminiscent of Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism. Finally, recent
theories and single molecule experiments on stretching of single stranded DNA
and PEs further sheds insights into the complex behavior of charged
macromolecules. The survey, which is limited to very few topics, shows the
importance of polyelectrolyte effects in a wide range of disciplines.

inflating the Universe rolls down to oscillate about its minimum, it triggers
the formation of long-lived two-field oscillons, which can contribute up to 20%
of the total energy density of the Universe. We show that these oscillons
emerge for a wide range of parameters consistent with WMAP 7-year data. These
objects contain total energy of about 25*10^20 GeV, localized in a region of

couplings. See-saw models provide a consistent and natural mechanism to

violate lepton flavour are explored. The reconstruction of high energy
parameters from neutrino data is partially possible within the framework of
these see-saw models and it is enhanced by the knowledge of phenomena outside
the neutrino sector, as it is the case of lepton number violation processes.
Grand Unification SUSY models offer a consistent theoretical framework for Type

the attractive feature of producing a lepton asymmetry through triplet decays

graph G is biclique-Helly when its family of maximal bicliques satisfies the
Helly property. If every induced subgraph of G is also biclique-Helly, then G
is hereditary biclique-Helly. A graph is C_4-dominated when every cycle of
length 4 contains a vertex that is dominated by the vertex of the cycle that is
not adjacent to it. In this paper we show that the class of hereditary
biclique-Helly graphs is formed precisely by those C_4-dominated graphs that
contain no triangles and no induced cycles of length either 5, or 6. Using this
characterization, we develop an algorithm for recognizing hereditary
biclique-Helly graphs in O(n^2+\alpha m) time and O(m) space. (Here n, m, and
\alpha = O(m^{1/2}) are the number of vertices and edges, and the arboricity of
the graph, respectively.) As a subprocedure, we show how to recognize those
C_4-dominated graphs that contain no triangles in O(\alpha m) time and O(m)

C_4-dominated graph with no triangles in O(n^2 + \alpha m) time and O(\alpha m)

behavior of sellers in an online auction (store). This pulsing behavior is
observed when sellers switch between advertising and processing states. We
assert that a seller switches her state in order to maximize her profit, and
further that this switch can be identified through the seller's reputation. We
show that for each seller there is an optimal reputation, i.e., the reputation
at which the seller should switch her state in order to maximize her total
profit. We design a stochastic behavioral model for an online seller, which
incorporates the dynamics of resource allocation and reputation. The design of
the model is optimized by using a stochastic advertising model from (16) and
used effectively in the Stochastic Optimal Control of Advertising (12). This
model of reputation is combined with the effect of online reputation on sales
price empirically verified in (9). We derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
differential equation, whose solution relates optimal wealth level to a
seller's reputation. We formulate both a full model, as well as a reduced model
with fewer parameters, both of which have the same qualitative description of
the optimal seller behavior. Coincidentally, the reduced model has a closed
form analytical solution that we construct.

exclusive compartments representing the human and vector dynamics. It also
includes a control parameter (insecticide) in order to fight the mosquito. The

simple shear, providing conditions for the onset of the dominant out-of-plane
modes using two models: (i) an asymptotic theory for the dynamics of a viscous
plate and (ii) the full Stokes equations. In either case, the plate is
stabilised by a combination of viscous resistance, surface tension and buoyancy
relative to an underlying denser fluid. In the limit of vanishing thickness,
plates buckle at a shear rate $\gamma/(\mu d)$ independent of buoyancy, where
2d is the plate thickness, $\gamma$ is the average surface tension between the
upper and lower surfaces and $\mu$ is the fluid viscosity. For thicker plates
stabilised by an equal surface tension at the upper and lower surfaces, at and
above onset, the most unstable mode has moderate wavelength, is stationary in
the frame of the centre-line, spans the width of the plate with crests and
troughs aligned at approximately $45^\circ$ to the walls and closely resembles
elastic shear modes. The thickest plates that can buckle have an aspect ratio
(thickness/width) approximately $\EC$ and are stabilised only by internal
viscous resistance. We show that the viscous plate model can only accurately
describe the onset of buckling for vanishingly thin plates but provides an
excellent description of the most unstable mode above onset. Finally, we show
that by modifying the plate model to incorporate advection and make the model
material frame-invariant, it is possible to extend its predictive power to
describe relatively short, travelling waves.

systems exhibit rich phase diagrams depending on the ratio between the spin
exchanges $J_0$ and $J_2$ in the bond spin singlet and quintet channels,
respectively. In 1D, the ground states exhibit a long-range-ordered
dimerization with a finite spin gap at $J_0/J_2>1$, and a gapless spin liquid
state at $J_0/J_2 \le 1$, respectively. In the former and latter cases, the
correlation functions exhibit the two-site and four-site periodicities,
respectively. In 2D, various spin correlation functions are calculated up to
the size of $4\times 4$. The Neel-type spin correlation dominates at large
values of $J_0/J_2$, while a $2\times 2$ plaquette correlation is prominent at
small values of this ratio. Between them, a columnar spin-Peierls dimerization
correlation peaks. We infer the competitions among the plaquette ordering, the

the infrared time lags and the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ widths for 10 type 1 AGNs
with the black hole masses from other techniques. We find the narrow Fe
K$\alpha$ line width is in average 2.6$^{+0.9}_{-0.4}$ times broader than
expected assuming an isotropic velocity distribution of the torus at the
distance measured by the infrared lags. We propose the thick disk model of the
torus could explain the observed larger line width. Another possibility is the
contamination by emission from the broad line region or the outer accretion
disk. Alternatively, the narrow iron line might originate from the inner most
part of the obscuring torus within the sublimation radius, while the infrared
emission from outer cooler part. We note the correlation between the black hole
masses based on this new technique and those based on other known techniques is
statistically insignificant. We argue that this could be attributed to the
small sample size and the very large uncertainties in the measurements of iron
K line widths. The next generation of X-ray observatories could help verify the
origin of the narrow iron K$\alpha$ line and the reliability of this new
technique.

magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We adopt, as the initial equilibrium state, a
spherical stellar object embedded in hydrostatic plasma which has a density
$\rho(r) \propto r^{- \alpha}$ and is threaded by a dipole magnetic field. The
injection of magnetic energy at the surface of compact star breaks the
equilibrium and triggers a two-component outflow. At the early evolutionary
stage, the magnetic pressure increases rapidly around the stellar surface,
initiating a magnetically driven outflow. A strong forward shock driven outflow
is then excited. The expansion velocity of the magnetically driven outflow is
characterized by the Alfv\'en velocity on the stellar surface, and follows a
simple scaling relation $v_{\rm mag} \propto {v_{\rm A}}^{1/2}$. When the
initial density profile declines steeply with radius, the strong shock is
accelerated self-similarly to relativistic velocity ahead of the magnetically
driven component. We find that it evolves according to a self-similar relation
$\Gamma_{\rm sh} \propto r_{\rm sh}$, where $\Gamma_{\rm sh}$ is the Lorentz
factor of the plasma measured at the shock surface $r_{\rm sh}$. Purely
hydrodynamic process would be responsible for the acceleration mechanism of the
shock driven outflow. Our two-component outflow model, which is the natural
outcome of the magnetic explosion, can provide a better understanding of the
magnetic active phenomena on various magnetized compact stars.

superfluid order parameter around them, as in the case of magnetic impurity
effect discussed in the superconductivity literature. This pair-breaking effect
naturally leads to localized excited states below the superfluid excitation
gap. To confirm our idea in a simply manner, we treat an attractive Fermi
Hubbard model within the mean-field theory at T=0. We self-consistently
determine superfluid properties around a nonmagnetic impurity, such as the
superfluid order parameter, local population imbalance, as well as
single-particle density of states, in the presence of population imbalance.

is to be recovered from incomplete measurements $y = Ax_0 + z$; here the
sensing matrix $A$ is an $n \times N$ random matrix with iid Gaussian entries
and $n < N$. A popular method of sparsity-promoting reconstruction is
$\ell^1$-penalized least-squares reconstruction (aka LASSO, Basis Pursuit).
  It is currently popular to consider the strict sparsity model, where the
object $x_0$ is nonzero in only a small fraction of entries. In this paper, we
instead consider the much more broadly applicable $\ell_p$-sparsity model,
where $x_0$ is sparse in the sense of having $\ell_p$ norm bounded by $\xi
\cdot N^{1/p}$ for some fixed $0 < p \leq 1$ and $\xi > 0$.
  We study an asymptotic regime in which $n$ and $N$ both tend to infinity with
limiting ratio $n/N = \delta \in (0,1)$, both in the noisy ($z \neq 0$) and
noiseless ($z=0$) cases. Under weak assumptions on $x_0$, we are able to
precisely evaluate the worst-case asymptotic minimax mean-squared
reconstruction error (AMSE) for $\ell^1$ penalized least-squares: min over
penalization parameters, max over $\ell_p$-sparse objects $x_0$. We exhibit the
asymptotically least-favorable object (hardest sparse signal to recover) and
the maximin penalization.
  Our explicit formulas unexpectedly involve quantities appearing classically
in statistical decision theory. Occurring in the present setting, they reflect
a deeper connection between penalized $\ell^1$ minimization and scalar soft
thresholding. This connection, which follows from earlier work of the authors
and collaborators on the AMP iterative thresholding algorithm, is carefully
explained.
  Our approach also gives precise results under weak-$\ell_p$ ball coefficient

this object was shown to have an exceptional over-abundance of Ba ([Ba/Fe]
+0.5) by a previous study, which is similar to those of r-process-enhanced
stars found in the field halo. Our new high-resolution spectroscopy for this
object for the blue region, however, reveals that no clear excess of r-process
elements, like Eu, appears in this object. Moreover, a significant excess of
carbon ([C/Fe]= +1.0) and a deficiency of Sr ([Sr/Fe] = -1.4) are found for
this object. Taking the variation of radial velocities measured at the two
different epochs into consideration, the origin of the excesses of heavy
neutron-capture elements in S15-19 is not the r-process, but is the s-process
in an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star that was the binary companion
(primary) of this object. Carbon- and s-process-enhanced material should have
been transferred to the surface of S15-19 across the binary system. These
results are compared with carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars in the field halo.

population of planetary nebulae (PNe). A shallow viewing angle and low
interstellar reddening towards the LMC potentially means a larger, more
complete flux-limited population can be assembled than for any other galaxy.
These advantages appear to be reflected by the small gap between the catalogued
($\sim$700 PNe) and estimated ($1000\pm250$ PNe) population size. With more
detailed multi-wavelength studies the catalogued number of LMC PNe may fall,
potentially widening this gap. We demonstrate here that the gap can be further
bridged with improved optical and near-infrared imaging surveys. We present
three [O III]-selected PNe discovered from ESO WFI observations of the 30
Doradus region and one serendipitous discovery from near-infrared Vista
Magellanic Cloud (VMC) survey observations. The WFI PNe have resolved [O III]
and H$\alpha$ nebulae that verify their PN nature and their [O III] fluxes
place them 6--7 mag ($m_{5007}=20$--21 mag) fainter than the bright-end of the
planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF). Their faintness, small angular
size and surrounding complex emission-line background explains why previous
H$\alpha$ surveys of the region did not select them. We estimate there may be
as many as 50--75 similar PNe awaiting discovery in the central $5\times5$
degrees of the LMC. The VMC survey routinely detects PNe as red resolved
nebulae that may allow some of this expected population to be recovered without
traditional narrow-band imaging surveys. We demonstrate this potential with the
first new VMC-selected PN which has a rare Wolf-Rayet [WC9]--[WC11] central
star.

perturbative calculation of the ground-state energy, makes possible to obtain
simple analytical formulas for $F$ and $\alpha$ over a range of interactions,

all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer
science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries
(DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at
journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of
sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of
journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and
citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First,
conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science
knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third,
experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.

charge neutrality point exactly at the Fermi level that limits the practical
application of this material. There are several ways to modify the
Fermi-level-region of graphene, e.g. adsorption of graphene on different
substrates or different molecules on its surface. In all cases the so-called
dispersion or van der Waals interactions can play a crucial role in the
mechanism, which describes the modification of electronic structure of
graphene. The adsorption of water on graphene is not very accurately reproduced
in the standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations and
highly-accurate quantum-chemical treatments are required. A possibility to
apply wavefunction-based methods to extended systems is the use of local
correlation schemes. The adsorption energies obtained in the present work by
means of CCSD(T) are much higher in magnitude than the values calculated with
standard DFT functional although they agree that physisorption is observed. The
obtained results are compared with the values available in literature for
binding of water on the graphene-like substrates.

completely characterizes SOT/SP quiet Sun measurements. The separation between

families: blue-lobe, red-lobe, and Q-like profiles. The blue-lobe profiles tend
to be associated with upflows (granules), whereas the red-lobe and Q-like ones
appear in downflows (intergranular lanes). Such profiles need to be interpreted
considering model atmospheres different from a uniformly magnetized

ejection. A rare subclass of these binaries are the eclipsing HW Vir binaries
where the sdB is orbited by a dwarf M star. Here we report the discovery of an

object ($\simeq0.068\,M_{\rm \odot}$) was found to orbit the hot subdwarf

networks. A network is said to be connected if there is a path between any pair
of nodes. A convenient way to study the connectivity of a random network is by
investigating the condition under which the network has no isolated node. The
condition under which the network has no isolated node provides a necessary
condition for a connected network. Further the condition for a network to have
no isolated node and the condition for the network to be connected can often be
shown to asymptotically converge to be the same as the number of nodes
approaches infinity, given a suitably defined random network and connection
model. Currently analytical results on the distribution of the number of
isolated nodes only exist for the unit disk model. This study advances research
in the area by providing the asymptotic distribution of the number of isolated
nodes in random networks with nodes Poissonly distributed on a unit square

H\""ormander's theorem about the smoothness of transition probabilities for a
diffusion under H\""ormander's ""brackets condition"". While both the result and
the technique of proof are well-known, the exposition given here is novel in
two aspects. First, we introduce Malliavin calculus in an ""intuitive"" way,
without using Wiener's chaos decomposition. While this may make it difficult to
prove some of the standard results in Malliavin calculus (boundedness of the
derivative operator in $L^p$ spaces for example), we are able to bypass these
and to replace them by weaker results that are still sufficient for our
purpose. Second, we introduce a notion of ""almost implication"" and ""almost
truth"" (somewhat similar to what is done in fuzzy logic) which allows, once the
foundations of Malliavin calculus are laid out, to give a very short and
streamlined proof of H\""ormader's theorem that focuses on the main ideas
without clouding it by technical details.

due to the combined action of both the relativistic jet and a weak accretion

FWHM of the lines are found to be in the usual range. Instead, the narrow
permitted lines in gamma-NLS1s are really narrow, since the disc and the lines
are much more powerful. This also confirms that gamma-NLS1 is really a new

correlation ($C_{FB} $), has been proposed by Liao and Koch to distinguish the
jet and true elliptic flow contribution to the measured elliptic flow ($v_2$)
in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Jet and flow fluctuation contribution to
elliptic flow is investigated within the framework of a multi-phase transport
model using the $C_{FB} $ probe. We found that the $C_{FB} $ correlation is
remarkably different and is about two times of that proposed by Liao and Koch.
It originates from the correlation between fluctuation of forward and backward
elliptic flow at low transverse momentum, which is mainly due to the initial
correlation between fluctuation of forward and backward eccentricity. This
results in an amendment of the $C_{FB}$ by a term related to the correlation
between fluctuation of forward and backward elliptic flow. Our results suggest
that a suitable rapidity gap for $C_{FB} $ correlation studies should be around

unique in the solar system and has been attributed to the presence of
widespread life. Here I show that this perspective can be quantified using
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Generating disequilibrium in a thermodynamic
variable requires the extraction of power from another thermodynamic gradient,
and the second law of thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on how much
power can be extracted. When applied to complex earth system processes, where
several irreversible processes compete to deplete the same gradients, it is
easily shown that the maximum thermodynamic efficiency is much less than the
classic Carnot limit, so that the ability of the earth system to generate power
and disequilibrium is limited. This approach is used to quantify how much free
energy is generated by various earth system processes to generate chemical
disequilibrium. It is shown that surface life generates orders of magnitude
more chemical free energy than any abiotic surface process, therefore being the
primary driving force for shaping the geochemical environment at the planetary
scale. To apply this perspective to the possible future of the planet, we first
note that the free energy consumption by human activity is a considerable term
in the free energy budget of the planet, and that global changes are closely
related to this consumption of free energy. Since human activity and demands
for free energy is going to increase in the future, the central question is how
human free energy demands can increase sustainably without negatively impacting
the ability of the earth system to generate free energy. I illustrate the
implications of this thermodynamic perspective by discussing the forms of
renewable energy and planetary engineering that would enhance overall free
energy generation and thereby ""empower"" the future of the planet.

analyzed with the 2003 version of the W-D code. It was shown that TX Cnc is an
overcontact binary system with a degree of contact factor $f=24.8%(\pm0.9%)$.
The absolute parameters of the system were calculated:
$M_1=1.319\pm0.007M_{\odot}$, $M_2=0.600\pm0.01M_{\odot}$;
$R_1=1.28\pm0.19R_{\odot}$, $R_2=0.91\pm0.13R_{\odot}$. TX Cnc may be on the
TRO-controlled stage of the evolutionary scheme proposed by Qian (2001a, b;

played an important role in the formation and evolution of TX Cnc by removing
angular momentum from the central system(Pribulla & Rucinski, 2006). In this

regularization method which is realized in 4-dimensional spacetime and
preserves gauge symmetry and Poincare symmetry in spite of the introduction of
two mass scales, namely the ultraviolet (UV) cut-off $M_c$ and infrared (IR)
cut-off $\mu_s$. It is shown that the dilation Ward identity which relates the
three-point diagrams with the vacuum polarization diagrams gets the standard
form of trace anomaly through quantum corrections in taking the consistent
limit $M_c\to \infty$ and $\mu_s = 0$ which recovers the original integrals.
This explicitly demonstrates that the loop regularization method is indeed a
self-consistent regularization scheme which is applicable to the calculations
not only for the chiral anomaly but also for the trace anomaly, at least at
one-loop level. It is also seen that the consistency conditions which relates
the tensor-type and scalar-type irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) are crucial
for obtaining a consistent result. As a comparison, we also present the
one-loop calculations by using the usual Pauli-Villars regularization and the

plasma environment is inhomogenous due to the presence of the low-frequency
Alfv\'en wave with a large amplitude, a situation that may apply to space
plasmas such as the solar corona and solar wind. The dispersion relation of the
plasma waves is determined from a linear stability analysis using a new
eigenvalue method that is employed to solve the set of differential wave
equations which describe the propagation of plasma waves along the direction of
the constant component of the Alfv\'en wave magnetic field. This approach also
allows one to consider weak compressive effects. In the presence of the
background Alfv\'en wave, the dispersion branches obtained differ significantly
from the situation of a uniform plasma. Due to compressibility, acoustic waves
are excited and couplings between various modes occur, and even an instability
of the compressive mode. In a kinetic treatment, these plasma waves would be
natural candidates for Landau-resonant wave-particle interactions, and may thus
via their damping lead to particle heating.

expansion can be understood, at least qualitatively, in terms of the presence
of vorticity distributed throughout the cloud, effectively counteracting the
usual reversal of the aspect ratio seen in free time-of-flight expansion of
non-rotating condensates.

communicate to a destination node through a layer of N-relay nodes. We
investigate the following question: what fraction of the capacity can we

independent of the channel configurations and the operating SNR, we can always
find a subset of k relays which alone provide a rate (kC/(k+1))-G, where C is
the information theoretic cutset upper bound on the capacity of the whole
network and G is a constant that depends only on N and k (logarithmic in N and
linear in k). In particular, for k = 1, this means that half of the capacity of
any N-relay diamond network can be approximately achieved by routing
information over a single relay. We also show that this fraction is tight:
there are configurations of the N-relay diamond network where every subset of k
relays alone can at most provide approximately a fraction k/(k+1) of the total
capacity. These high-capacity k-relay subnetworks can be also discovered
efficiently. We propose an algorithm that computes a constant gap approximation
to the capacity of the Gaussian N-relay diamond network in O(N log N) running
time and discovers a high-capacity k-relay subnetwork in O(kN) running time.
  This result also provides a new approximation to the capacity of the Gaussian
N-relay diamond network which is hybrid in nature: it has both multiplicative
and additive gaps. In the intermediate SNR regime, this hybrid approximation is
tighter than existing purely additive or purely multiplicative approximations
to the capacity of this network.

there exists configurations of arbitrary mass but their radius is always larger
than a minimum value. For attractive short-range interactions (negative
scattering lengths), equilibrium configurations only exist below a maximum
mass. Above that mass, the system is expected to collapse and form a black
hole. We also study the radius versus scattering length relation for a given
mass. We find that stable configurations only exist above a (negative) minimum
scattering length. Our approximate analytical solution, based on a Gaussian
ansatz, provides a very good agreement with the exact solution obtained by
numerically solving a nonlinear differential equation representing hydrostatic
equilibrium. Our treatment is, however, easier to handle and permits to study
the stability problem, and derive an analytical expression of the pulsation
period, by developing an analogy with a simple mechanical problem.

detected 14368 X-ray sources in the 1.4 square-degree survey region, an
automatic source classification study that classified 10714 of these as very
likely young stars in Carina, and an analysis of their clustering properties.
We used HAWK-I at the ESO VLT to conduct a very deep near-IR survey with
sub-arcsecond angular resolution, covering about 1280 square-arcminutes. The
HAWK-I images reveal more than 600000 individual infrared sources, whereby
objects as faint as J ~ 23, H ~ 22, and Ks ~ 21 are detected at S/N >= 3. While
less than half of the Chandra X-ray sources have counterparts in the 2MASS
catalog, the ~5 mag deeper HAWK-I data reveal infrared counterparts to 6636 (=
88.8%) of the 7472 Chandra X-ray sources in the HAWK-I field. We analyze
near-infrared color-color and color-magnitude diagrams to derive information
about the extinctions, infrared excesses, ages, and masses of the X-ray
selected objects. The near-infrared properties agree well with the results of
the automatic X-ray source classification. The shape of the K-band luminosity
function of the X-ray selected Carina members agrees well with that derived for
the Orion Nebula Cluster, suggesting that, down to the X-ray detection limit
around 0.5-1 Msun, the shape of the IMF in Carina is consistent with that in
Orion (and thus the field IMF). The fraction of stars with near-infrared
excesses is rather small, <=10%, but shows considerable variations between
individual parts of the complex. The distribution of extinctions for the
diskless stars ranges from ~1.6 mag to ~6.2 mag (central 80th percentile),
clearly showing a considerable range of differential extinction between
individual stars in the complex.

clusters around NGC 3311, combined with kinematical data of the galaxy itself,
to investigate the dark matter distribution in the central region of Hydra I.
Radial velocities of 118 bright globular clusters, based on VLT/VIMOS mask
spectroscopy, are used to calculate velocity dispersions which are well defined
out to 100 kpc. NGC 3311 is the most distant galaxy for which this kind of
study has been performed. We also determine velocity dispersions of the stellar
component from long slit spectroscopy out to 20 kpc. Moreover, we present a new
photometric model for NGC 3311 in the V-band. We search for a dark halo which
in the context of a spherical Jeans model. We also compare the radial velocity
distributions of globular clusters and planetary nebulae. The projected stellar
velocity dispersion rises from 185 km/s to 350 km/s at a radius of 20 kpc. The
globular cluster dispersion rises as well from 500 km/s at 10 kpc to about 800
km/s at 100 kpc, comparable to the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies.
A dark matter halo with a core reproduces well the velocity dispersions of
stars and globular clusters simultaneously under isotropy. The central stellar
velocity dispersions predicted by cosmological NFW halos are less good
representations, while the globular clusters allow a wide range of halo
parameters. A suspected radial anisotropy of the stellar population aggravates
the deviations. However, we find discrepancies with previous kinematical data,
which we cannot resolve and may indicate a more complicated velocity pattern.
Although one cannot conclusively demonstrate that the dark matter halo of NGC
3311 has a core rather than a cusp, a core seems to be preferred by the present
data. A more complete velocity field and an analysis of the anisotropy is
required to reach firm conclusions.

against). A synopsis of each argument is presented here, with discussion and
analysis. Seen through Riccioli's 126 arguments, the debate over the Copernican
hypothesis appears dynamic and indeed similar to more modern scientific
debates. Both sides present good arguments as point and counter-point.
Religious arguments play a minor role in the debate; careful, reproducible
experiments a major role. To Riccioli, the anti-Copernican arguments carry the
greater weight, on the basis of a few key arguments against which the
Copernicans have no good response. These include arguments based on telescopic
observations of stars, and on the apparent absence of what today would be
called ""Coriolis Effect"" phenomena; both have been overlooked by the historical
record (which paints a picture of the 126 arguments that little resembles
them). Given the available scientific knowledge in 1651, a geo-heliocentric
hypothesis clearly had real strength, but Riccioli presents it as merely the
""least absurd"" available model - perhaps comparable to the Standard Model in
particle physics today - and not as a fully coherent theory. Riccioli's work
sheds light on a fascinating piece of the history of astronomy, and highlights
the competence of scientists of his time.

logarithmic forest distances which are known to generalize the resistance
distance and the shortest path distance are a subclass of walk distances. On
the other hand, the long walk distance is equal to the resistance distance in a
transformed graph.

deg^2 field surveyed by the Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP), which
includes the major ionizing clusters and the most active sites of ongoing star
formation within the Great Nebula in Carina. Candidate YSOs were identified via
infrared (IR) excess emission from dusty circumstellar disks and envelopes,
using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope Vela--Carina survey and the
Two-Micron All Sky Survey. We model the 1--24 /mu m IR spectral energy
distributions of the YSOs to constrain physical properties. Our Pan-Carina YSO
Catalog (PCYC) is dominated by intermediate-mass (2 Msun < m < 10 Msun) objects
with disks, including Herbig Ae/Be stars and their less evolved progenitors.
The PCYC provides a valuable complementary dataset to the CCCP X-ray source
catalogs, identifying 1029 YSOs in Carina with no X-ray detection. We also
catalog 410 YSOs with X-ray counterparts, including 62 candidate protostars.
Candidate protostars with X-ray detections tend to be more evolved than those
without. In most cases, X-ray emission apparently originating from
intermediate-mass, disk-dominated YSOs is consistent with the presence of
low-mass companions, but we also find that X-ray emission correlates with
cooler stellar photospheres and higher disk masses. We suggest that
intermediate-mass YSOs produce X-rays during their early pre-main sequence
evolution, perhaps driven by magnetic dynamo activity during the convective
atmosphere phase, but this emission dies off as the stars approach the main
sequence. Extrapolating over the stellar initial mass function scaled to the
PCYC population, we predict a total population of >2x10^4 YSOs and a
present-day star formation rate (SFR) of >0.008 Msun/yr. The global SFR in the
Carina Nebula, averaged over the past ~5 Myr, has been approximately constant.

bilayer graphene using the temperature dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations. In the density range of 0.7 x 10^12/cm^2 < n < 4.1 x 10^12 /cm^2,
both the hole mass m*_h and the electron mass m*_e increase with increasing
density, demonstrating the hyperbolic nature of the bands. The hole mass m*_h
is approximately 20-30% larger than the electron mass m*_e. Tight-binding
calculations provide a good description of the electron-hole asymmetry and
yield an accurate measure of the inter-layer hopping parameter v_4 = 0.063.
Both m*_h and m*_e are substantially suppressed compared to single-particle
values, providing clear and unprecedented evidence for the strong
renormalization effect of electron-electron interaction in the band structure
of bilayer graphene.

computing the transmission coefficients and tracing them back to electronic
conduction channels of the wire and the host. We predict that carbon nanotubes
of appropriate radii encapsulating a Mo wire have metallic behavior, even if
both the nanotube and the wire are insulators. Therefore, encapsulating Mo
wires in CNT is a way to create conductive quasi one-dimensional hybrid
nanostructures.
