one of the best alternative way to ensure security. More over, there are many
image encryption schemes have been proposed, each one of them has its own
strength and weakness. This paper presents a new algorithm for the image
encryption/decryption scheme. This paper is devoted to provide a secured image
encryption technique using multiple chaotic based circular mapping. In this
paper, first, a pair of sub keys is given by using chaotic logistic maps.
Second, the image is encrypted using logistic map sub key and in its
transformation leads to diffusion process. Third, sub keys are generated by
four different chaotic maps. Based on the initial conditions, each map may
produce various random numbers from various orbits of the maps. Among those
random numbers, a particular number and from a particular orbit are selected as
a key for the encryption algorithm. Based on the key, a binary sequence is
generated to control the encryption algorithm. The input image of 2-D is
transformed into a 1- D array by using two different scanning pattern (raster
and Zigzag) and then divided into various sub blocks. Then the position
permutation and value permutation is applied to each binary matrix based on
multiple chaos maps. Finally the receiver uses the same sub keys to decrypt the
encrypted images. The salient features of the proposed image encryption method
are loss-less, good peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Symmetric key
encryption, less cross correlation, very large number of secret keys, and
key-dependent pixel value replacement.

influence of bars on the evolution of galaxy discs through the study of their
stellar content. We examine here the kinematics, star formation history,
mass-weighted, luminosity-weighted, and single stellar population (SSP)
equivalent ages and metallicities for four galaxies ranging from lenticulars to
late-type spirals. The data employed extends to 2-3 disc scalelengths, with
S/N(A)>50. Several techniques are explored to derive star formation histories
and SSP-equivalent parameters, each of which are shown to be compatible. We
demostrate that the age-metallicity degeneracy is highly reduced by using
spectral fitting techniques --instead of indices-- to derive these parameters.
We found that the majority of the stellar mass in our sample is composed of old
(~10 Gyr) stars. This is true in the bulge and the disc region, even beyond two
disc scalelengths. In the bulge region, we find that the young, dynamically
cold, structures produced by the presence of the bar (e.g., nuclear discs or
rings) are responsible for shaping the bulges' age and metallicity gradients.
In the disc region, a larger fraction of young stars is present in the external
parts of the disc compared with the inner disc. The disc growth is, therefore,
compatible with a moderate inside-out formation scenario, where the luminosity
weighted age changes from ~10 Gyrs in the centre, to ~4 Gyrs at two disc
scalelengths, depending upon the galaxy. For two galaxies, we compare the
metallicity and age gradients of the disc major axis with that of the bar,
finding very important differences. In particular, the stellar population of
the bar is more similar to the bulge than to the disc, indicating that, at
least in those two galaxies, bars formed long ago and have survived to the
present day. (abridged)

Unlike the existing complicated standard belief propagation (SBP) detector that
considers all the edges of the factor graph when updating messages, the
proposed RBP focuses on partial edges, which largely reduces computational
complexity. In particular, relax degree is introduced in to determine how many
edges to be selected, whereby RBP is a generalized edge selection based BP
method and SBP is a special case of RBP having the smallest relax degree.
Moreover, we propose a novel Gaussian approximation with feedback information
mechanism to enable the proposed RBP detector. In order to further improve the
detection performance, we also propose to cascade a minimum mean square error
(MMSE) detector before the RBP detector, from which pseudo priori information
is judiciously exploited. Convergence and complexity analyses, along with the
numerical simulation results, verify that the proposed RBP outperform other BP
methods having the similar complexity, and the MMSE cascaded RBP even
outperform SBP at the largest relax degree in large MIMO systems.

Multi-function system testing is considered as fusion (or revelation) of
clique-like structures. The following sets are considered: (i) subsystems
(system parts or units / components / modules), (ii) system functions and a
subset of system components for each system function, and (iii) function
clusters (some groups of system functions which are used jointly). Test
procedures (as units testing) are used for each subsystem. The procedures lead
to an ordinal result (states, colors) for each component, e.g., [1,2,3,4]
(where 1 corresponds to 'out of service', 2 corresponds to 'major faults', 3
corresponds to 'minor faults', 4 corresponds to 'trouble free service'). Thus,
for each system function a graph over corresponding system components is
examined while taking into account ordinal estimates/colors of the components.
Further, an integrated graph (i.e., colored graph) for each function cluster is
considered (this graph integrates the graphs for corresponding system
functions). For the integrated graph (for each function cluster) structure
revelation problems are under examination (revelation of some subgraphs which
can lead to system faults): (1) revelation of clique and quasi-clique (by
vertices at level 1, 2, etc.; by edges/interconnection existence) and (2)
dynamical problems (when vertex colors are functions of time) are studied as
well: existence of a time interval when clique or quasi-clique can exist.
Numerical examples illustrate the approach and problems.

  A repetition of size $h$ ($h\geqslant1$) in a given sequence is a subsequence
of consecutive terms of the form: $xx=x_1... x_hx_1... x_h$. A sequence is
nonrepetitive if it does not contain a repetition of any size. The remarkable
construction of Thue asserts that 3 different symbols are enough to build an
arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequence. We consider game-theoretic versions of
results on nonrepetitive sequences. A nonrepetitive game is played by two
players who pick, one by one, consecutive terms of a sequence over a given set
of symbols. The first player tries to avoid repetitions, while the second
player, in contrast, wants to create them. Of course, by simple imitation, the
second player can force lots of repetitions of size 1. However, as proved by
Pegden, there is a strategy for the first player to build an arbitrarily long
sequence over 37 symbols with no repetitions of size $>1$. Our techniques allow
to reduce 37 to 6. Another game we consider is an erase-repetition game. Here,
whenever a repetition occurs, the repeated block is immediately erased and the
next player to move continues the play. We prove that there is a strategy for
the first player to build an arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequence over 8
symbols. Our approach is inspired by a new algorithmic proof of the Lov\'asz

presented as supporting evidence. The new evidence is that some more
unexplained coincidences are explained in our model:
  1) The ""scale problem"" is solved because the Higgs field expectation value is
predicted to be very small compared to say some fundamental scale, that might
be the Planck scale.
  2) The Higgs VEV need not, however, to be just zero, but rather is predicted
to be so that the running top-Yukawa coupling just is about to be unity at this
scale; in this way the (weak) scale easily becomes ""exponentially small"".
  Instead of the top-Yukawa we should rather say the highest flavour Yukawa
coupling here.
  These predictions are only achieved by allowing the principle of minimization
of the imaginary part of the action SI(history) to to a certain extent adjust
some coupling constants in addition to the initial conditions.

this is not the only possible dissolutional instability in porous rocks; there
is another instability that operates instantaneously on any initial porosity
field, including an entirely uniform one. The relative importance of the two
mechanisms depends on the ratio of the porosity increase to the initial

limestone formations where the initial porosity is small and there is the
possibility of a large increase in permeability. In quartz-rich sandstones,
where the proportion of easily soluble material (e.g. carbonate cements) is
small, the instability in the steady-state equations is dominant.

mutually unbiased basis sets (MUBs), and constrain the combinations of such
patterns that can coexist (ie, the stoichiometry) in full complements of p^N+1
MUBs. We consider Hilbert spaces of prime power dimension (as realized by
systems of N prime-state particles, or qupits), where full complements are
known to exist, and we assume only that MUBs are eigenbases of generalized
Pauli operators, without using a particular construction. The general rules
include the following: 1) In any MUB, a particular qupit appears either in a
pure state, or totally entangled, and 2) in any full MUB complement, each qupit
is pure in p+1 bases (not necessarily the same ones), and totally entangled in
the remaining p^N-p. It follows that the maximum number of product bases is
p+1, and when this number is realized, all remaining p^N-p bases in the
complement are characterized by the total entanglement of every qupit. This
""standard distribution"" is inescapable for two qupits (of any p), where only
product and generalized Bell bases are admissible MUB types. This and the
following results generalize previous results for qubits and qutrits. With
three qupits there are three MUB types, and a number of combinations (p+2) are
possible in full complements. With N=4, there are 6 MUB types for p=2, but new
MUB types become possible with larger p, and these are essential to the
realization of full complements. With this example, we argue that new MUB
types, showing new entanglement characteristics, should enter with every step
in N, and when N is a prime plus 1, also at critical p values, p=N-1. Such MUBs
should play critical roles in filling complements.

corresponding coefficient of impermeable particles of the same size. We also
show that a similar scaling applies to the translational self-diffusion

experiments (the ratio depends on the detector properties and typically falls

  5, August 2010",,,,"cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scheduling is the central concept used frequently in Operating System. It
helps in choosing the processes for execution. Round Robin (RR) is one of the
most widely used CPU scheduling algorithm. But, its performance degrades with
respect to context switching, which is an overhead and it occurs during each
scheduling. Overall performance of the system depends on choice of an optimal
time quantum, so that context switching can be reduced. In this paper, we have
proposed a new variant of RR scheduling algorithm, known as Dynamic Quantum
with Readjusted Round Robin (DQRRR) algorithm. We have experimentally shown
that performance of DQRRR is better than RR by reducing number of context
switching, average waiting time and average turn around time.

  1(9) February 2011",,"10.5120/2037-2648",,"cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main objective of the paper is to improve the Round Robin (RR) algorithm
using dynamic ITS by coalescing it with Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
algorithm thus reducing the average waiting time, average turnaround time and
the number of context switches. The original time slice has been calculated for
each process based on its burst time.This is mostly suited for soft real time
systems where meeting of deadlines is desirable to increase its performance.
The advantage is that processes that are closer to their remaining completion
time will get more chances to execute and leave the ready queue. This will
reduce the number of processes in the ready queue by knocking out short jobs
relatively faster in a hope to reduce the average waiting time, turn around
time and number of context switches. This paper improves the algorithm [8] and
the experimental analysis shows that the proposed algorithm performs better
than algorithm [6] and [8] when the processes are having an increasing order,
decreasing order and random order of burst time.

absolute values of all eigenvalues of its adjacent matrix. For $\Delta\geq 3$
and $t\geq 3$, denote by $T_a(\Delta,t)$ (or simply $T_a$) the tree formed from
a path $P_t$ on $t$ vertices by attaching $\Delta-1$ $P_2$'s on each end of the
path $P_t$, and $T_b(\Delta, t)$ (or simply $T_b$) the tree formed from
$P_{t+2}$ by attaching $\Delta-1$ $P_2$'s on an end of the $P_{t+2}$ and
$\Delta -2$ $P_2$'s on the vertex next to the end. In [X. Li, X. Yao, J. Zhang
and I. Gutman, Maximum energy trees with two maximum degree vertices, J. Math.
Chem. 45(2009), 962--973], Li et al. proved that among trees of order $n$ with
two vertices of maximum degree $\Delta$, the maximal energy tree is either the
graph $T_a$ or the graph $T_b$, where $t=n+4-4\Delta\geq 3$. However, they
could not determine which one of $T_a$ and $T_b$ is the maximal energy tree.
This is because the quasi-order method is invalid for comparing their energies.
In this paper, we use a new method to determine the maximal energy tree. It
turns out that things are more complicated. We prove that the maximal energy
tree is $T_b$ for $\Delta\geq 7$ and any $t\geq 3$, while the maximal energy
tree is $T_a$ for $\Delta=3$ and any $t\geq 3$. Moreover, for $\Delta=4$, the
maximal energy tree is $T_a$ for all $t\geq 3$ but $t=4$, for which $T_b$ is
the maximal energy tree. For $\Delta=5$, the maximal energy tree is $T_b$ for
all $t\geq 3$ but $t$ is odd and $3\leq t\leq 89$, for which $T_a$ is the
maximal energy tree. For $\Delta=6$, the maximal energy tree is $T_b$ for all
$t\geq 3$ but $t=3,5,7$, for which $T_a$ is the maximal energy tree. One can
see that for most $\Delta$, $T_b$ is the maximal energy tree, $\Delta=5$ is a
turning point, and $\Delta=3$ and 4 are exceptional cases.

flux and the compound adopts an orthorhombic structure as determined by X-ray
diffraction measurements. Electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties indicate
that the system undergoes two successive phase transitions occurring at TN1 ~
90 K and TN2 ~ 26 K. At TN1, electrical resistivities (\rho(b) and \rho(ac))
are enhanced while magnetic susceptibilities (\chi(b) and \chi(ac)) are reduced
in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the b-axis, consistent with
the scenario of antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave formation. At TN2, specific
heat reveals a slope change, and \chi(ac) decreases sharply but \chi(b) has a
clear jump before it decreases again with decreasing temperature. Remarkably,
both \rho(b) and \rho(ac) decrease sharply with thermal hysteresis, indicating
the first-order nature of the phase transition at TN2. At low temperatures,
\rho(b) and \rho(ac) can be described by {\rho} = {\rho}0 + AT^\alpha ({\rho}0,
A, and {\alpha} are constants). Interestingly, these constants vary with
applied magnetic field. The ground state of CaFe4As3 is discussed.

the algebraic closure of $\Q$, of degree $\geq2$ defined over a number field
$K$. Let $v$ be a non-archimedean valuation of $K$. We say that $\Phi$ has
critically good reduction at $v$ if any pair of distinct ramification points of
$\Phi$ do not collide under reduction modulo $v$ and the same holds for any
pair of branch points. We say that $\Phi$ has simple good reduction at $v$ if
the map $\Phi_v$, the reduction of $\Phi$ modulo $v$, has the same degree of
$\Phi$. We prove that if $\Phi$ has critically good reduction at $v$ and the
reduction map $\Phi_v$ is separable, then $\Phi$ has simple good reduction at
$v$.

magnetic moment or perpendicular anisotropy. We demonstrate the proposed design

methods. We present results for the gs energy, magnetic order parameter,
spin-spin correlation function, and plaquette valence-bond crystal (PVBC)

\kappa_{c_{1}} \approx 0.47$, a collinear striped AFM phase for $\kappa >
\kappa_{c_{2}} \approx 0.60$, and a paramagnetic PVBC phase for $\kappa_{c_{1}}
\lesssim \kappa \lesssim \kappa_{c_{2}}$. The transition at $\kappa_{c_{2}}$
appears to be of first-order type, while that at $\kappa_{c_{1}}$ is
continuous. Since the N\'eel and PVBC phases break different symmetries our
results favor the deconfinement scenario for the transition at
$\kappa_{c_{1}}$.

to be \emph{cross-intersecting} if for any $i$ and $j$ in $\{1, 2, ..., k\}$
with $i \neq j$, any set in $\mathcal{A}_i$ intersects any set in
$\mathcal{A}_j$. For a finite set $X$, let $2^X$ denote the \emph{power set of
$X$} (the family of all subsets of $X$). A family $\mathcal{H}$ is said to be
\emph{hereditary} if all subsets of any set in $\mathcal{H}$ are in
$\mathcal{H}$; so $\mathcal{H}$ is hereditary if and only if it is a union of
power sets. We conjecture that for any non-empty hereditary sub-family
$\mathcal{H} \neq \{\emptyset\}$ of $2^X$ and any $k \geq |X|+1$, both the sum
and product of sizes of $k$ cross-intersecting sub-families $\mathcal{A}_1,
\mathcal{A}_2, ..., \mathcal{A}_k$ (not necessarily distinct or non-empty) of
$\mathcal{H}$ are maxima if $\mathcal{A}_1 = \mathcal{A}_2 = ... =
\mathcal{A}_k = \mathcal{S}$ for some largest \emph{star $\mathcal{S}$ of
$\mathcal{H}$} (a sub-family of $\mathcal{H}$ whose sets have a common
element). We prove this for the case when $\mathcal{H}$ is \emph{compressed
with respect to an element $x$ of $X$}, and for this purpose we establish new
properties of the usual \emph{compression operation}. For the product, we
actually conjecture that the configuration $\mathcal{A}_1 = \mathcal{A}_2 = ...
= \mathcal{A}_k = \mathcal{S}$ is optimal for any hereditary $\mathcal{H}$ and
any $k \geq 2$, and we prove this for a special case too.
