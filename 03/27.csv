model (CFSU(5)), whose soft supersymmetry-breaking (SSB) mass parameters are
constrained to be universal at some input scale, $M_{in}$, above the GUT scale,
$M_{GUT}$. We analyze the parameter space of CFSU(5) assuming that the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) provides the cosmological cold dark matter,
paying careful attention to the matching of parameters at the GUT scale. We
first display some specific examples of the evolutions of the SSB parameters
that exhibit some generic features. Specifically, we note that the relationship
between the masses of the lightest neutralino and the lighter stau is sensitive
to $M_{in}$, as is the relationship between the neutralino mass and the masses
of the heavier Higgs bosons. For these reasons, prominent features in generic
$(m_{1/2}, m_0)$ planes such as coannihilation strips and rapid-annihilation
funnels are also sensitive to $M_{in}$, as we illustrate for several cases with
tan(beta)=10 and 55. However, these features do not necessarily disappear at
large $M_{in}$, unlike the case in the minimal conventional SU(5) GUT. Our
results are relatively insensitive to neutrino masses.

transmissions -sensors with more informative samples deliver their messages
first- and prove that optimal detection performance can be achieved using only
a subset of the total messages. Taking to one extreme this approach, we show
that just a single delivering allows making the detection errors as small as
desired, for a sufficiently large network size: a one-bit detection scheme can
be asymptotically consistent. The transmission ordering is based on the modulus
of some local statistic (MO system). We derive analytical results proving the
asymptotic consistency and, for the particular case that the local statistic is
the log-likelihood (\ell-MO system), we also obtain a bound on the error
convergence rate. All the theorems are proved under the general setup of random
number of sensors. Computer experiments corroborate the analysis and address
typical examples of applications including: non-homogeneous Poisson-deployed

present the dependence of event shape mean values on the leading jet transverse

predictions that were matched to fixed order results at NLO accuracy (NLO+NLL).
Predictions from pythia Tune A agree fairly well with the data. However, the
underlying event contributes significantly to these observables, making it
difficult to make direct comparisons to the NLO+NLL predictions, which do not
account for the underlying event. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a
new observable, a weighted difference of the mean values of the thrust and
thrust minor, which is less sensitive to the underlying event, allowing for a
comparison with NLO+NLL. Both pythia Tune A and the NLO+NLL calculations agree
well within the 20% theoretical uncertainty with the data for this observable,
indicating that perturbative QCD successfully describes shapes of the hadronic
final states.

fixing the form of the velocity distribution when estimating constraints on
WIMP mass and cross sections means losing out on the information on the speed

empirical form of the speed distribution can lead to good constraints on the
speed distribution. Moreover, one can use Bayesian model-selection criteria to
determine if a theoretically-inspired functional form for the speed
distribution (such as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) fits better than an
empirical model. The shape of the degeneracy between WIMP mass and cross
sections and their offset from the true values of those parameters depends on
the hypothesis for the speed distribution, which has significant implications
for consistency checks between direct-detection and collider data. In addition,
I find that the uncertainties on theoretical parameters depends sensitively on
the upper end of the energy range used for WIMP searches. Better constraints on

Our Chandra ACIS observation of LS 5039 provided a high-significance (~10sigma)
detection of extended emission clearly visible for up to 1' from the point
source. The spectrum of this emission can be described by an absorbed power-law
model with photon index Gamma=1.9pm0.3, somewhat softer than the point source

5% of the point source flux; the latter is a factor of ~2 lower than the lowest

guarantees on the privacy and utility of released data. While it is well-known
how to release data based on counts and simple functions under this guarantee,
it remains to provide general purpose techniques to release different kinds of

generally any data that can be indexed by a tree structure. Directly applying
existing differential privacy methods to this type of data simply generates
noise. Instead, we introduce a new class of ""private spatial decompositions"":
these adapt standard spatial indexing methods such as quadtrees and kd-trees to
provide a private description of the data distribution. Equipping such

provide meaningful privacy guarantees. Various primitives, such as choosing
splitting points and describing the distribution of points within a region,
must be done privately, and the guarantees of the different building blocks
composed to provide an overall guarantee. Consequently, we expose the design
space for private spatial decompositions, and analyze some key examples. Our
experimental study demonstrates that it is possible to build such
decompositions efficiently, and use them to answer a variety of queries
privately with high accuracy.

periods combined with a 4-year radial-velocity survey for membership and
binarity in the 220Myr open cluster M34. We report surface rotation periods for
120 stars, 83 of which are late-type cluster members. A comparison to previous
work serves to illustrate the importance of high cadence long baseline
photometric observations and membership information. The new M34 periods are
less biased against slow rotation and cleaned for non-members. The rotation
periods of the cluster members span more than an order of magnitude from 0.5
day up to 11.5 days, and trace two distinct rotational sequences - fast (C) and
moderate-to-slow (I) - in the color-period diagram. The sequences represent two
different states in the rotational evolution of the late-type cluster members.
We use the color-period diagrams for M34 and for younger and older clusters to
estimate the timescale for the transition from the C to the I sequence and find
~<150Myr, ~150-300Myr, and ~300-600Myr for G, early-mid K, and late K dwarfs,
respectively. The small number of stars in the gap between C and I suggest a
quick transition. We estimate a lower limit on the maximum spin-down rate
(dP/dt) during this transition to be ~0.06 days/Myr and ~0.08 days/Myr for
early and late K dwarfs, respectively. We compare the I sequence rotation
periods in M34 and the Hyades for G and K dwarfs and find that K dwarfs spin
down slower than the Skumanich rate. We determine a gyrochronology age of
240Myr for M34. We measure the effect of cluster age uncertainties on the
gyrochronology age for M34 and find the resulting error to be consistent with
the error estimate for the technique. We use the M34 I sequence to redetermine
the coefficients in the expression for rotational dependence on color used in
gyrochronology (abridged).

and high density, and the Virial expansion of a non-ideal gas for matter at low
density. For this EOS we use the RMF effective interaction FSUGold, whereas our
earlier EOS was based on the RMF effective interaction NL3. The FSUGold
interaction has a lower pressure at high densities compared to the NL3
interaction. We calculate the resulting EOS at over 100,000 grid points in the
temperature range $T$ = 0 to 80 MeV, the density range $n_B$ = 10$^{-8}$ to 1.6

particles in a wave packet are studied. The dynamics of the model is described
in terms of a two-dimensional area preserving map. We show that the phase space
is mixed in the sense that there are regular and chaotic regions coexisting. We
use a connection with the standard map in order to find the position of the
first invariant spanning curve which borders the chaotic sea. We find that the
position of the first invariant spanning curve increases as a power of the
control parameter with the exponent 2/3. The standard deviation of the kinetic
energy of an ensemble of initial conditions obeys a power law as a function of
time, and saturates after some crossover. Scaling formalism is used in order to
characterize the chaotic region close to the transition from integrability to
nonintegrability and a relationship between the power law exponents is derived.
The formalism can be applied in many different systems with mixed phase space.
Then, dissipation is introduced into the model and therefore the property of
area preservation is broken, and consequently attractors are observed. We show
that after a small change of the dissipation, the chaotic attractor as well as
its basin of attraction are destroyed, thus leading the system to experience a
boundary crisis. The transient after the crisis follows a power law with
exponent -2.

This problem acquired a new dimension with the recent discovery that
environmental and genetic perturbations of the bacterium Escherichia coli are
followed by the temporary activation of a large number of latent metabolic
pathways, which suggests the hypothesis that temporarily activated reactions
impact growth and hence facilitate adaptation in the presence of perturbations.
Here we test this hypothesis computationally and find, surprisingly, that the
availability of latent pathways consistently offers no growth advantage, and
tends in fact to inhibit growth after genetic perturbations. This is shown to
be true even for latent pathways with a known function in alternate conditions,
thus extending the significance of this adverse effect beyond apparently
nonessential genes. These findings raise the possibility that latent pathway
activation is in fact derivative of another, potentially suboptimal, adaptive
response.

currently employed models focus on edge dynamics, with little support for
endogenously changing vertex sets. Here, we show how an existing approach based
on logistic network regression can be extended to serve as highly scalable
framework for modeling large networks with dynamic vertex sets. We place this
approach within a general dynamic exponential family (ERGM) context, clarifying
the assumptions underlying the framework (and providing a clear path for

Coxeter group W. Then B acts naturally on the set of chambers of B. We assume
that B is disjoint from the Coxeter arrangement A=A(W) of W. In this paper, we
show that the W-orbits of the set of chambers of B are in one-to-one
correspondence with the chambers of C=A\cup B which are contained in an
arbitrarily fixed chamber of A. From this fact, we find that the number of
W-orbits of the set of chambers of B is given by the number of chambers of C
divided by the order of W. We will also study the set of chambers of C which
are contained in a chamber b of B. We prove that the cardinality of this set is
equal to the order of the isotropy subgroup W_b of b. We illustrate these
results with some examples, and solve an open problem in Kamiya, Takemura and

integration by parts. This property can be useful in constructing energy-stable
discretizations of partial differential vequations. SBP operators are defined
by a weight matrix and a difference operator, with the latter designed to
approximate $d/dx$ to a specified order of accuracy. The accuracy of the weight
matrix as a quadrature rule is not explicitly part of the SBP definition. We
show that SBP weight matrices are related to trapezoid rules with end
corrections whose accuracy matches the corresponding difference operator at
internal nodes. The accuracy of SBP quadrature extends to curvilinear domains
provided the Jacobian is approximated with the same SBP operator used for the
quadrature. This quadrature has significant implications for SBP-based
discretizations; for example, the discrete norm accurately approximates the
$L^{2}$ norm for functions, and multi-dimensional SBP discretizations
accurately mimic the divergence theorem.

the database community. Roughly, the idea is that a randomized query mechanism
provides sufficient privacy protection if the ratio between the probabilities
that two adjacent datasets give the same answer is bound by e^epsilon. In the
field of information flow there is a similar concern for controlling
information leakage, i.e. limiting the possibility of inferring the secret
information from the observables. In recent years, researchers have proposed to
quantify the leakage in terms of R\'enyi min mutual information, a notion
strictly related to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we show how to model the
query system in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the
notion of differential privacy with that of mutual information. We show that
differential privacy implies a bound on the mutual information (but not
vice-versa). Furthermore, we show that our bound is tight. Then, we consider
the utility of the randomization mechanism, which represents how close the
randomized answers are, in average, to the real ones. We show that the notion
of differential privacy implies a bound on utility, also tight, and we propose
a method that under certain conditions builds an optimal randomization

Recurrence (CPR) --- to analyze connections between nine stock indices spread
worldwide. We suggest a slight modification of the CPR approach in order to get
more robust results. We examine trends in CPR for an approximately 19-month
window moved along the time series and compare them to {\rho}. Binning CPR into
three levels of connectedness: strong, moderate and weak, we extract the trends
in number of connections in each bin over time. We also look at the behavior of
CPR during the Dot-Com bubble by shifting the time series to align their peaks.
CPR mainly uncovers that the markets move in and out of periods of strong
connectivity erratically, instead of moving monotonously towards increasing
global connectivity. This is in contrast to {\rho}, which gives a picture of
ever increasing correlation. CPR also exhibits that time shifted markets have
high connectivity around the Dot-Com bubble of 2000. We stress on the
importance of significance testing in interpreting measures applied to field
data. CPR is more robust to significance testing. It has the additional
advantages of being robust to noise, and reliable for short time series lengths
and low frequency of sampling. Further, it is more sensitive to changes than
{\rho} as it captures correlations between the essential dynamics of the
underlying systems.

best agreement with data, the model requires a lower WIMP mass than
conventionally expected, but one that is of current interest due to DAMA/LIBRA
results, at around 10 GeV$/c^2$. This model has a very high cross section for
neutrino-WIMP interactions. We make suggestions for future searches that would
confirm or refute this model.

magnetic classes and showed that 69 of them are flexomagnetic. Then we explore
how the symmetry breaking, inevitably present in the vicinity of the surface,
changes the local symmetry and thus the form of the flexomagnetic tensors. All
possible surface magnetic classes (in the number of 19) were obtained from the
90 bulk magnetic classes for the surface cuts 001, 010 and 100 types. It
appeared that all 90 bulk magnetic classes become flexomagnetic, piezomagnetic
and piezoelectric in the vicinity of surface. Using the free energy approach,
we show that the flexomagnetic effect leads to a new type of
flexo-magnetoelectric (FME) coupling in nanosized and bulk materials, in all
spatial regions, where the polarization and (anti)magnetization vectors are
spatially inhomogeneous due to external or internal forces. The linear FME
coupling, proportional to the product of the gradients of (anti)magnetization
and polarization, flexoelectric and flexomagnetic tensors, is significant in
nanosized ferroelectrics-(anti)ferromagnetics, where gradients of the
polarization and magnetization obligatory exist. The spontaneous FME coupling
induced by the spatial confinement give rise to the size-dependent linear
magnetoelectric coupling in nanosized ferroelectrics-(anti)ferromagnetics.
  We show that the flexomagnetic effect may lead to improper ferroelectricity
in bulk (anti)ferromagnetics via the linear and nonlinear FME coupling.
Inhomogeneous spontaneous polarization is induced by the (anti)magnetization
gradient, which exists in all spatial regions, where polarization varies and
(anti)magnetization vector changes its direction. The gradient can be induced
by the surface influence as well as by external strain via e.g. the sample
bending.

the region bordering streamer helmets, where the flow tube geometry is distinct
from flow tubes rooted in the center of coronal holes. We examine whether this
particular tube geometry leads to standing shocks in the inner slow wind in
this region. To isolate the influence of tube geometry, a simple isothermal
wind model is employed and is solved in terms of the Lambert W function. In
addition to a continuous solution, the model may also admit solutions with
shocks, readily constructed with a graphical approach. When allowed, the shock
solutions appear in pairs, one with a shock located in the streamer stalk, the
other with a shock below the cusp along the streamer border. We show that
solutions with standing shocks exist in a broad area in the parameter space
characterizing the wind temperature and flow tube. In particular, streamers
with cusps located at a heliocentric distance $\gtrsim 3.2 R_\odot$ can readily
support discontinuous slow winds with temperatures barely higher than 1 MK.

technique and in situ measurements by the Ulysses spacecraft show a bimodal
structure for the solar wind at solar minimum conditions. At present what makes
the fast wind fast and the slow wind slow still remains to be answered. While a
robust empirical correlation exists between the coronal expansion rate $f_c$ of
the flow tubes and the speeds $v$ measured in situ, further data analysis
suggests that $v$ depends on more than just $f_c$. We examine whether the
non-radial shape of field lines, which naturally accompanies any non-radial
expansion, could be an additional geometrical factor. We solved the transport
equations incorporating the heating due to turbulent Alfv\'en waves for an
electron-proton solar wind along curved field lines given by an analytical
magnetic field model, representative of a solar minimum corona. The field line
shape is found to influence substantially the solar wind parameters, reducing
the asymptotic speed by up to $\sim 130$ km s$^{-1}$, or by $\sim 28%$ in
relative terms, compared with the case neglecting the field line curvature.
This effect was interpreted in the general framework of energy addition in the
solar wind: Relative to the straight case, the field line curvature enhances
the effective energy deposition to the subsonic flow, resulting in a higher
proton flux and a lower terminal proton speed. Our computations suggest that
the field line curvature could be a geometrical factor which, in addition to
the tube expansion, substantially influences the solar wind speed. Furthermore,
at solar minima although the field line curvature unlikely affects the polar
fast solar wind, it does help make the wind at low latitudes slow, thereby
helping better reproduce the Ulysses measurements.

calculate its dependence on the width of the wall numerically. In CaTiO3 we

a rather intricate zoology of peculiar behaviors, which are occasionally in

sense. In this paper, a thermodynamical cycle is assembled for an ideal device
working with non-Boltzmaniann long-range fluid and operating in contact with
two thermal reservoirs. The system is analytically shown to violate the second
principle of thermodynamics, a phenomenon that ultimately relates to the
existence of regions with negative kinetic specific heat, in the canonical
ensemble for the system under scrutiny. We argue that the validity of the
second principle of thermodynamics can be possibly restored, by revisiting the
definition of canonical ensemble, as well as the Fourier law of heat transport,
and consequently relaxing the constraint on the maximal efficiency as imposed

associated with the properties of their being Pick or Bernstein functions.
Representations based on Poisson and Burniston--Siewert integrals are given as
well.

  India (2005)",,,,"physics.gen-ph astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The simulation of the Cherenkov light lateral distribution function (LDF) in
Extensive Air Showers (EAS) was perfomed with the CORSIKA code in the energy
range 10^13-10^16 eV for configuration of the Tunka-25 EAS array. On the basis
of this simulation we obtained sets of approximating functions for primary
protons, iron nuclei and gamma-quanta for zenith angles Theta<=20. The
comparison of the calculated Cherenkov light LDF with that measured with the
Tunka-25 array has shown an opportunity of primary particle identification and
definition of its energy around the ""knee"".
