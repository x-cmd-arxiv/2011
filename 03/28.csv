operator T, we show that there is a constant C(T,P) so that we prove the sharp
norm dependence on T_#, the maximal truncations of T, in both weak and strong
type L^p(w) norms. Namely, for the weak type norm, T_# maps L^p(w) to
weak-L^p(w) with norm at most \|w\|_{A_p}. And for the strong type norm, the
norm estimate is \|w\|_{A_p}^{\max(1, (p-1) ^{-1})}. These estimates are not
improvable in the power of \lVert w\rVert_{A_p}. Our argument follows the
outlines of the arguments of Lacey-Petermichl-Reguera (Math.\ Ann.\ 2010) and
Hyt\""onen-P\'erez-Treil-Volberg (arXiv, 2010) with new ingredients, including a
weak-type estimate for certain duals of T_#, and sufficient conditions for two

the effective diffusion coefficient in a mixture of two identical fluids. The
steady-state diffusive flux in a finite system subject to a concentration
gradient is enhanced because of long-range correlations between concentration
fluctuations and fluctuations of the velocity parallel to the concentration
gradient. The enhancement of the diffusive transport depends on the system size
L and grows as \ln(L/L_{0}) in quasi-two dimensional systems, while in three
dimensions it grows as L_{0}^{-1}-L^{-1}, where L_{0} is a reference length.
The predictions of a simple fluctuating hydrodynamics theory, closely related
to second-order mode-mode coupling analysis, are compared to results from
particle simulations and a finite-volume solver and excellent agreement is
observed. We elucidate the direct connection to the long-time tail of the
velocity autocorrelation function in finite systems, as well as finite-size

conclusively demonstrate that the nonlinear advective terms need to be retained

For a given hyperbolic system u_t+f(u)_x=0, a standard approach is to analyze
directly the second order PDE system for the extensions. Instead we find it
advantageous to consider the equations satisfied by the lengths beta^i of the
right eigenvectors r_i the Jacobian matrix Df, as measured with respect to the
inner product defined by an extension. Our geometric formulation provides a
natural and systematic approach to existence of extensions. By prescribing the
eigen-fields r_i our results automatically apply to all systems with the same

theorems can be applied. The size of the set of extensions follows by

highest for an intervening absorber yet detected in any low-redshift QSO

absorbing gas traced by H I resides in two strong, blended component groups
that possess a total logN(HI) = 18 - 18.8. The ion ratios and column densities
of C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, and Fe, except the O VI, can be accommodated into a
simple photoionization model in which diffuse, low-metallicity halo gas is
exposed to a photoionizing field from stars in the nearby galaxies that
propagates into the halo at 10% efficiency. We constrain the metallicity firmly
within the range 0.1 - 1 Zsun, and photoionization modeling indirectly
indicates a subsolar metallicity of 0.05 - 0.5 Zsun. The appearance of strong O
VI and nine Mg II components and our review of similar systems in the
literature support the ""interface"" picture of high-velocity O VI: the total
strength of the O VI shows a positive correlation with the number of detected
components in the low-ionization gas, however the total O VI column densities
still far exceed the values expected from interface models for the number of

the projectivization of the S_8-representation V_{4,4}. There is a single
S_8-skew cubic C in P^{13}. The fact that M_8 lies on the skew cubic C is a

is the singular locus of C. These constructions yield the free resolution of
M_8, and are used in the determination of the ""single"" equation cutting out the

they are surprisingly singular, in the sense of having a dual of remarkably low

to the near-UV region comprising the Be II line at 3131.066 A, in an attempt to
investigate whether Be suffers any depletion such as the case of Li showing a
large diversity. We found that, while most of these Sun-like stars are
superficially similar in terms of their A(Be) (Be abundances) around the solar
value within ~ +/- 0.2dex, 4 out of 118 samples turned out strikingly
Be-deficient (by more than ~2 dex) and these 4 stars belong to the group of
lowest v_e sin i (projected rotation velocity). Moreover, even for the other
majority showing an apparent similarity in Be, we can recognize a tendency that
A(Be) gradually increases with an increase in v_e sin i. These observational
facts suggest that any solar analog star (including the Sun) generally suffers
some kind of Be depletion during their lives, where the rotational velocity (or
the angular momentum) plays an important role in the sense that depletion tends
to be enhanced by slower rotation. Hence, our findings require that the
occasionally stated view ""G-type dwarfs with T_eff ~< 6000 K are essentially
homogeneous in Be with their original composition retained"" should be revised.
Also, our analysis indicates that the difference of ~0.2 dex in A(Be) between
the solar photosphere and the meteorite really exists, implying that ""UV
missing opacity"" is irrelevant at least for this Be II line.

on the universal, non relativistic, planar breakout solutions (Sapir et al.

\kappa, and angular intensity corresponding to the steady state planar limit.
These approximations are accurate for progenitors with a scale height much
smaller than the radius. The light curves are insensitive to the density
profile and are determined by the progenitor radius R, and the breakout
velocity and density, v_0 and \rho_0 respectively, and \kappa. The total
breakout energy, E_BO, and the maximal ejecta velocity, v_max, are shown to be
E_BO=8.0\pi R^2\kappa^-1cv_0 and v_max=2.0v_0 respectively, to an accuracy of
about 10%. The calculated light curves are valid up to the time of transition
to spherical expansion, t_sph\approx R/4v_0. Approximate analytic expressions
for the light curves are provided for breakouts in which the shock crossing
time at breakout, t_0=c/\kappa\rho_0v_0^2, is << R/c (valid for R<10^14 cm).
Modifications of the flux angular intensity distribution and differences in
shock arrival times to the surface, \Delta t_asym, due to moderately asymmetric
explosions, affect the early light curve but do not affect v_max and E_BO. For
4v_0<<c, valid for large (RSG) progenitors, L\propto t^{-4/3} at max(\Delta

blue wing is likely from disk emission. The stellar population around X-1 has
an age older than 30 Myr, without very blue stars or young clusters. This

motion (mBm) is a Gaussian extension of fBm that allows to control the

long range dependence properties. This generalization is obtained by replacing
the constant Hurst parameter H of fBm by a function h(t). Multifractional
Brownian motion has proved useful in many applications, including the ones just

theory, as originally proposed in [15], [6], [4] and in [5]. In that view, a

rotation of H around the [001]-axis, discontinuous 120-degree flop of P-vector

increasing the in-plane H above 3 T, however, the stable q-direction changes
from q||<1-10> to q||<110>, leading to a change of P-flop patterns under

three-dimensional Holstein model are studied within the adiabatic
approximation. The parameter regime is appropriate for organic semiconductors
used in single crystal based field effect transistors. Different approaches
have been used to solve the model: self-consistent Born approximation valid for
weak electron-phonon coupling, coherent potential approximation exact for
infinite dimensions, and numerical diagonalization for finite lattices. With
increasing temperature, the width of the spectral functions gets larger and
larger making the approximation of quasi-particle less accurate. On the
contrary, their peak positions are never strongly renormalized in comparison
with the bare ones. As expected, the density of states is characterized by an
exponential tail corresponding to localized states at low temperature. For weak
electron-lattice coupling, the optical conductivity follows a Drude behavior,
while, for intermediate electron-lattice coupling, a temperature dependent peak
is present at low frequency. For high temperatures and low particle densities,
the mobility always exhibits a power-law behavior as function of temperature.
With decreasing the particle density, at low temperature, the mobility shows a
transition from metallic to insulating behavior. Results are discussed in
connection with available experimental data.

days of B-band maximum light obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory to derive
the impact of Si and Ca features on supernovae intrinsic luminosity and
determine a dust reddening law. We use the equivalent width of Si II
{\lambda}4131 in place of light curve stretch to account for first-order
intrinsic luminosity variability. The resultant empirical spectral reddening
law exhibits strong features associated with Ca II and Si II {\lambda}6355.
After applying a correction based on the Ca II H&K equivalent width we find a
reddening law consistent with a Cardelli extinction law. Using the same input
data, we compare this result to synthetic rest-frame UBVRI-like photometry in
order to mimic literature observations. After corrections for signatures
correlated with Si II {\lambda}4131 and Ca II H&K equivalent widths, and
introducing an empirical correlation between colors, we determine the dust
component in each band. We find a value of the total-to-selective extinction
ratio, RV = 2.8 \pm 0.3. This agrees with the Milky Way value, in contrast to
the low RV values found in most previous analyses. This result suggests that
the long-standing controversy in interpreting SN Ia colors and their
compatibility with a classical extinction law, critical to their use as
cosmological probes, can be explained by the treatment of the dispersion in
colors, and by the variability of features apparent in SN Ia spectra.

computed the initial conditions based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) minijet

principle very efficient in discriminating the various models. However, due to

ProDiMo and the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST to model the

disk dust mass Mdust = (2.E-8 - 5.E-8) Msun, whereas the total disk gas mass is

models, the disk extends from 0.022 AU (just outside of the co-rotation radius)
to only about 10 AU. Larger disks are found to be inconsistent with the CO
J=3-2 non-detection. The low velocity component of the [OI] 6300A emission line
is consistent with being emitted from the inner disk. The model can also
reproduce the line flux of H2 v=1-0 S(1) at 2.122 mic. An additional
high-velocity component of the [OI] 6300A emission line, however, points to the
existence of an additional jet/outflow of low velocity (40 - 65) km/s with mass
loss rate ~1.E-9 Msun/yr. In relation to our low estimations of the disk mass,
such a mass loss rate suggests a disk lifetime of only ~(0.05 - 3) Myr,

to optimal cloning of sets of qubits of known modulus of expectation value of
Pauli's Z operator. Our results can be applied for cloning of an arbitrary
mirror-symmetric distribution of qubits on Bloch sphere including in special
cases the universal cloning and phase-covariant cloning. We show that the
cloning is optimal by adapting our former optimality proof for axisymmetric

realization of the optimal mirror phase-covariant 1 to 2 cloning of a qubit,
for which the mean probability of successful cloning varies from 1/6 to 1/3
depending on prior information on the set of qubits to be cloned. The qubits
are represented by polarization states of photons generated by the type-I
spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The scheme is based on the interference
of two photons on an unbalanced polarization-dependent beam splitter with
different splitting ratios for vertical and horizontal polarization components
and the additional application of feedforward by means of Pockels cells. The
experimental feasibility of the proposed setup is carefully studied including
various kinds of imperfections and losses including: (i) finite efficiency of
generating a pair of entangled photons in the type-I spontaneous parametric
down conversion, (ii) the influence of choosing various splitting ratios of the

general? Aims. We aim to add additional observational constraints to support or
reject the major effects of star-planet interactions in stellar activity, based
on CaII chromospheric emission flux. Methods. We performed a statistical
analysis of CaII emission flux of stars with planets, as well as a comparison
between CaII and X-ray emission fluxes, searching for dependencies on planetary
parameters. Results. In the present sample of stars with planets, there are no

ambitious and promising detector of solar axions to date. We show that large
improvements in magnetic field volume, x-ray focusing optics and detector
backgrounds are possible beyond those achieved in the CERN Axion Solar
Telescope (CAST). For hadronic models, a sensitivity to the axion-photon
coupling of $\gagamma\gtrsim {\rm few} \times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ is
conceivable, 1--1.5 orders of magnitude beyond the CAST sensitivity. If axions
also couple to electrons, the Sun produces a larger flux for the same value of
the Peccei-Quinn scale, allowing one to probe a broader class of models. Except
for the axion dark matter searches, this experiment will be the most sensitive
axion search ever, reaching or surpassing the stringent bounds from SN1987A and
possibly testing the axion interpretation of anomalous white-dwarf cooling that
predicts $m_a$ of a few meV. Beyond axions, this new instrument will probe
entirely unexplored ranges of parameters for a large variety of axion-like
particles (ALPs) and other novel excitations at the low-energy frontier of
elementary particle physics.

techniques in the study of heteroclinic connections between finite and infinite
invariant sets. For this, we remind the reader of the Poincar\'e
compactification: this transformation allows to project a $n$-dimensional
vector space $X$ on the $n$-dimensional unit hemisphere of $X\times \mathbb{R}$
and infinity on its $(n-1)$-dimensional equator called the sphere at infinity.
Under normalizability condition, vector fields on $X$ transform into vector
fields on the Poincar\'e hemisphere whose associated flows let the equator
invariant. The dynamics on the equator reflects the dynamics at infinity, but
is now finite and may be studied by Conley index techniques. Furthermore, we
observe that some non-isolated behavior may occur around the equator, and
introduce the concept of invariant sets at infinity of isolated invariant
dynamical complement. Through the construction of an extended phase space
together which an extended flow, we are able to adapt the Conley index
techniques and prove the existence of connections to such non-isolated
invariant sets.

previously been obtained towards several high mass protostars, very little

spectral survey of the bands at 3, 2, 1 and 0.8 mm towards the solar type
protostar IRAS16293-2422. The observations covered about 200\,GHz and were
obtained with the IRAM-30m and JCMT-15m telescopes. Particular attention was
devoted to the inter-calibration of the obtained spectra with previous
observations. All the lines detected with more than 3 sigma and free from
obvious blending effects were fitted with Gaussians to estimate their basic
kinematic properties. More than 4000 lines were detected (with sigma \geq 3)
and identified, yielding a line density of approximatively 20 lines per GHz,
comparable to previous surveys in massive hot cores. The vast majority (~2/3)
of the lines are weak and due to complex organic molecules. The analysis of the
profiles of more than 1000 lines belonging 70 species firmly establishes the
presence of two distinct velocity components, associated with the two objects,
A and B, forming the IRAS16293-2422 binary system. In the source A, the line
widths of several species increase with the upper level energy of the
transition, a behavior compatible with gas infalling towards a ~1 Mo object.
The source B, which does not show this effect, might have a much lower central
mass of ~0.1 Mo. The difference in the rest velocities of both objects is
consistent with the hypothesis that the source B rotates around the source A.
This spectral survey, although obtained with single-dish telescope with a low
spatial resolution, allows to separate the emission from 2 different
components, thanks to the large number of lines detected. The data of the
survey are public and can be retrieved on the web site

formation model involves a sharp entropy barrier against the accretion of gas
onto low-mass halos, the shock heating of infalling gas far from the central
regions of massive halos, and supernova feedback that drives the gas out of
shallow halo potential wells. With the first approach, we show that the large
majority of galaxies within group- and cluster-mass halos, known to be mainly
dwarf ellipticals, have acquired the bulk of their stellar mass through gas
accretion and not via galaxy mergers. With the second approach, we
qualitatively reproduce the downsizing trend of greater ages at greater masses
in stars and predict an upsizing trend of greater ages as one proceeds to
masses lower than 10^10 M_Sun. We find that the fraction of galaxies with very
young stellar populations (more than half the stellar mass formed within the
last 1.5 Gyr) is a function of present-day stellar mass, which peaks at 0.5% at
m_crit=10^7.5-9.5 M_Sun, roughly corresponding to the masses of blue compact
dwarfs. We predict that the stellar mass function of galaxies should not show a
maximum at m_stars > 10^{5.5}, M_Sun, with a power-law stellar mass function
with slope approx -1.6 if the IGM temperature in the outskirts of halos before
reionization is set by H2 cooling. We speculate on the nature of the lowest

solve the long-lasting `cooling flow problem' in cosmological systems. In a
previous paper, we showed that cold accretion feedback and, to a lesser degree,
Bondi self-regulated models are in fact able to quench cooling rates for
several Gyr, at the same time preserving the mainc ool core features, like
observed density and temperature profiles. Is it true also for lighter systems,
such as galaxy groups? The answer is globally yes, although with remarkable
differences. Adopting a modified version of the AMR code FLASH 3.2, we found
that successful 3D simulations with cold and Bondi models are almost convergent
in the galaxy group environment, with mechanical efficiencies in the range
5.e-4 - 1.e-3 and 5.e-2 - 1.e-1, respectively. The evolutionary storyline of
galaxy groups is dominated by a quasi-continuous gentle injection with
sub-Eddington outflows (with mechanical power and velocity around 1.e44 erg/s
and 1.e4 km/s). The cold and hybrid accretion models present, in addition, very
short quiescence periods, followed by moderate outbursts (10 times the previous
phase), which generate a series of 10-20 kpc size cavities with high density
contrast, temperatures similar to the ambient medium and cold rims. After shock
heating, a phase of turbulence promotes gas mixing and diffusion of metals,
which peak along jet-axis (up to 40 kpc) during active phases. At this stage
the tunnel, produced by the enduring outflow (hard to detect in the mock SBx
maps), is easily fragmented, producing tiny buoyant bubbles, typically a few
kpc in size. In contrast to galaxy clusters, the AGN self-regulated feedback
has to be persistent, with a `delicate touch', rather than rare and explosive
strokes. This evolutionary difference dictates in the end that galaxy groups
are not scaled-down versions of clusters.

coherent radio emissions, both generally thought to be signatures of particle
acceleration. Two limb events were selected during which the radio emission was
well correlated in time with hard X-rays. The radio emissions were of the type
of decimetric pulsations as determined from the spectrogram observed by
Phoenix-2 of ETH Zurich. The radio positions were measured from observations
with the Nancay Radioheliograph between 236 and 432 MHz and compared to the
position of the coronal X-ray source imaged with RHESSI. The radio pulsations
originated at least 30 - 240 Mm above the coronal hard X-ray source. The
altitude of the radio emission increases generally with lower frequency. The
average positions at different frequencies are on a line pointing approximately
to the coronal hard X-ray source. Thus, the pulsations cannot be caused by
electrons trapped in the flare loops, but are consistent with emission from a
current sheet above the coronal source.

Chemical databases such as the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry (UDFA)
are indispensable in the numerical modeling of astrochemical networks. Several
of the listed reactions in the UDFA have properties that are problematic in
numerical computations: Some are parametrized in a way that leads to extremely
divergent behavior for low kinetic temperatures. Other reactions possess
multiple entries that are each valid in a different temperature regime, but
have no smooth transition when switching from one to another. Numerically, this
introduces many difficulties.We present corrected parametrizations for these
sets of reactions in the UDFA06 database.
  Methods. From the tabulated parametrization in UDFA, we created artificial
data points and used a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to find a set of improved
fit parameters without divergent behavior for low temperatures. For reactions
with multiple entries in the database that each possess a different temperature
regime, we present one joint parametrization that is designed to be valid over
the whole cumulative temperature range of all individual reactions.
  Results. We show that it is possible to parametrize numerically problematic
reactions from UDFA in a form that avoids low temperature divergence.
Additionally, we demonstrate that it is possible to give a collective
parametrization for reaction rate coefficients of reactions with multiple
entries in UDFA. We present these new fitted values in tabulated form.

switching between running and tumbling modes as a function of the nutrient
concentration they experienced in the past. At short time one observes a drift
of the bacterial population, while at long time one observes accumulation in
high-nutrient regions. Recent work has viewed chemotaxis as a compromise
between drift toward favorable regions and accumulation in favorable regions. A
number of earlier studies assume that a bacterium resets its memory at tumbles
-- a fact not borne out by experiment -- and make use of approximate
coarse-grained descriptions. Here, we revisit the problem of chemotaxis without
resorting to any memory resets. We find that when bacteria respond to the
environment in a non-adaptive manner, chemotaxis is generally dominated by
diffusion, whereas when bacteria respond in an adaptive manner, chemotaxis is
dominated by a bias in the motion. In the adaptive case, favorable drift occurs
together with favorable accumulation. We derive our results from detailed
simulations and a variety of analytical arguments. In particular, we introduce
a new coarse-grained description of chemotaxis as biased diffusion, and we
discuss the way it departs from older coarse-grained descriptions.

the dynamics of both gas phases. We quantify the effects of such an interaction
using hydrodynamical simulations of cold clouds travelling through a hot medium

threshold between clouds and corona, of about 75 km/s, below which the hot gas
ceases to absorb momentum from the cold clouds. It follows that in a disc
galaxy like the Milky Way a static corona would be rapidly accelerated: the
corona is expected to rotate and to lag, in the inner regions, by ~ 80-120 km/s
with respect to the cold disc. We also show how the existence of this velocity
threshold can explain the observed kinematics of the cold extra-planar gas.

shift-charge current contains a spatial part responsible for diffusion of the
charges. Moreover, in the incompressible limit, the equation of motion becomes
the standard diffusion equation. The fluid is indeed imperfect because the
energy flows neither along the field gradient nor along the shift current. The
fluid has zero vorticity and is not dissipative: there is no entropy
production, the energy-momentum is exactly conserved, the temperature vanishes

condition is investigated in quasineutral electron-ion and
electron-positron-ion plasmas immersed in a uniform magnetic field. Using the
standard pseudopotential method, the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are
exactly solved and a global allowed matching condition for propagation of
kinetic solitary waves is derived. It is remarked that, depending on the plasma
parameters, the kinetic solitons can be sub- or super-Alfv\'{e}nic, in general.
It is further revealed that, either upper or lower soliton speed-limit is
independent of fractional plasma parameters. Furthermore, the soliton
propagation angle with respect to that of the uniform magnetic field is found
to play a fundamental role in controlling the soliton matching speed-range.

Heisenberg exchange between localized spins. In a first step we use mean-field
theory with two order parameters. The first order parameter is a complex
pairing amplitude between conduction electrons and localized spins which
describes condensation of Kondo (or Zhang-Rice) singlets. A nonvanishing value
implies that the localized spins contribute to the Fermi surface volume. The
second order parameter describes singlet-pairing between the localized spins
and competes with the Kondo-pairing order parameter. Reduction of the carrier
density in the conduction band reduces the energy gain due to the formation of
the large Fermi surface and induces a phase transition to a state with strong
singlet correlations between the localized spins and a Fermi surface which
comprises only the conduction electrons. The model thus shows a doping-driven
change of its Fermi surface volume. At intermediate doping and low temperature
there is a phase where both order parameters coexist, which has a gapped large
Fermi surface and d-wave superconductivity. The theory thus qualitatively
reproduces the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors. In the second part of
the paper we show how the two phases with different Fermi surface volume emerge
in a strong coupling theory applicable in limit of large Kondo exchange. The
large-Fermi-surface phase corresponds to a `vacuum' of localized Kondo singlets
with uniform phase and the quasiparticles are spin-1/2 charge fluctuations
around this fully paired state. In the small-Fermi-surface phase the
quasiparticles correspond to propagating Kondo-singlets or triplets whereby the
phase of a given Kondo-singlet corresponds to its momentum. In this picture a
phase transition occurs for low filling of the conduction band as well.

to the combined effect of barely-detectable energy releases, so called
nanoflares, that occur throughout the solar atmosphere. Alas, the nanoflare
density and brightness implied by this hypothesis means that conclusive
verification is beyond present observational abilities. Nevertheless, we
investigate the plausibility of the nanoflare hypothesis by constructing a
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that can derive the energy of a nanoflare from
the nature of an ideal kink instability. The set of energy-releasing
instabilities is captured by an instability threshold for linear kink modes.
Each point on the threshold is associated with a unique energy release and so
we can predict a distribution of nanoflare energies. When the linear
instability threshold is crossed, the instability enters a nonlinear phase as
it is driven by current sheet reconnection. As the ensuing flare erupts and
declines, the field transitions to a lower energy state, which is modelled by
relaxation theory, i.e., helicity is conserved and the ratio of current to
field becomes invariant within the loop. We apply the model so that all the
loops within an ensemble achieve instability followed by energy-releasing
relaxation. The result is a nanoflare energy distribution. Furthermore, we
produce different distributions by varying the loop aspect ratio, the nature of
the path to instability taken by each loop and also the level of radial
expansion that may accompany loop relaxation. The heating rate obtained is just
sufficient for coronal heating. In addition, we also show that kink instability
cannot be associated with a critical magnetic twist value for every point along
the instability threshold.

the two correlation lengths associated with translational and

each diverging at different temperature and that their finite size scaling
properties are consistent with the KTHNY theory. We also used the temperature

two critical temperatures, which are found to be in agreement with those
determined from the divergent correlation lengths and from the Binder ratio.

factor which compares the marginal likelihood of the data under two given
different models. In this paper, we consider the class of hierarchical
loglinear models for discrete data given under the form of a contingency table
with multinomial sampling. We assume that the Diaconis-Ylvisaker conjugate
prior is the prior distribution on the loglinear parameters and the uniform is
the prior distribution on the space of models. Under these conditions, the
Bayes factor between two models is a function of their prior and posterior
normalizing constants. These constants are functions of the hyperparameters
$(m,\alpha)$ which can be interpreted respectively as marginal counts and the
total count of a fictive contingency table.
  We study the behaviour of the Bayes factor when $\alpha$ tends to zero. In
this study two mathematical objects play a most important role. They are,
first, the interior $C$ of the convex hull $\bar{C}$ of the support of the
multinomial distribution for a given hierarchical loglinear model together with
its faces and second, the characteristic function $\mathbb{J}_C$ of this convex
set $C$.
  We show that, when $\alpha$ tends to 0, if the data lies on a face $F_i$ of
$\bar{C_i},i=1,2$ of dimension $k_i$, the Bayes factor behaves like
$\alpha^{k_1-k_2}$. This implies in particular that when the data is in $C_1$
and in $C_2$, i.e. when $k_i$ equals the dimension of model $J_i$, the sparser
model is favored, thus confirming the idea of Bayesian regularization.

aspects of populations. Languages are also a characteristics of the human kind.
New religions, new languages appear though others disappear. All religions and
languages evolve when they adapt to the society developments. On the other
hand, the number of adherents of a given religion, the number of persons
speaking a language is not fixed. Several questions can be raised. E.g. from a
macroscopic point of view : How many religions/languages exist at a given time?
What is their distribution? What is their life time? How do they evolve?. From
a microscopic view point: can one invent agent based models to describe
macroscopic aspects? Does it exist simple evolution equations? It is
intuitively accepted, but also found through from statistical analysis of the
frequency distribution that an attachment process is the primary cause of the
distribution evolution : usually the initial religion/language is that of the
mother. Later on, changes can occur either due to heterogeneous agent
interaction processes or due to external field constraints, - or both. Such
cases can be illustrated with historical facts and data. It is stressed that
characteristic time scales are different, and recalled that external fields are
very relevant in the case of religions, rending the study more interesting

A
potential energy relief of the graphene flake is computed using ab initio and

mechanisms of diffusion and drift of the graphene flake on the graphite surface
are considered. A new mechanism of diffusion and drift of the flake is
proposed. According to the proposed mechanism, rotational transition of the
flake from commensurate to incommensurate state takes place with subsequent
simultaneous rotation and translational motion until a commensurate state is
reached again, and so on. Analytic expressions for the diffusion coefficient
and mobility of the flake corresponding to different mechanisms are derived in
wide ranges of temperatures and sizes of the flake. The molecular dynamics
simulations and estimates based on ab initio and empirical calculations
demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can be dominant under certain
conditions. The influence of structural defects on the diffusion of the flake
is examined on the basis of calculations of the potential energy relief and
molecular dynamics simulations. The methods of control over the diffusion and
drift of graphene components in nanoelectromechanical systems are discussed.
The possibility to experimentally determine the barriers to relative motion of
graphene layers based on the study of diffusion of a graphene flake is
considered. The results obtained can be also applied to polycyclic aromatic
molecules on graphene and should be qualitatively valid for a set of

target physical objective as a function of the controls. This paper focuses on
the landscape for the transition probability Pif between the states of a finite
level quantum system. Traditionally, the controls are applied fields; here we
extend the notion of control to also include the Hamiltonian structure, in the
form of time independent matrix elements. Level sets of controls that produce
the same transition probability value are shown to exist at the bottom Pif =
0.0 and top Pif = 1.0 of the landscape with the field and/or Hamiltonian
structure as controls. We present an algorithm to continuously explore these
level sets starting from an initial point residing at either extreme value of
Pif . The technique can also identify control solutions that exhibit the
desirable properties of (a) robustness at the top and (b) the ability to
rapidly rise towards an optimal control from the bottom. Numerical simulations
are presented to illustrate the varied control behavior at the top and bottom
of the landscape for several simple model systems.

controlled by the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The reaction proceeds by capture to
the ground states and several excited states in O-15. In order to obtain a
reliable extrapolation of the excitation curve to astrophysical energy, fits in
the R-matrix framework are needed. In an energy range that sensitively tests
such fits, new cross section data are reported here for the four major
transitions in the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction. The experiment has been performed
at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) 400 kV
accelerator placed deep underground in the Gran Sasso facility in Italy. Using
a composite germanium detector, summing corrections have been considerably
reduced with respect to previous studies. The cross sections for capture to the
ground state and to the 5181, 6172, and 6792 keV excited states in O-15 have
been determined at 359, 380, and 399 keV beam energy. In addition, the
branching ratios for the decay of the 278 keV resonance have been remeasured.

review the fundamental physical processes that underlie the generation and
transfer of polarized radiation in stellar atmospheres, and I discuss the
present status of the theoretical schemes now available, pointing out their
main successes and limitations. I also present some ideas about the theoretical
improvements that I consider necessary to achieve a correct interpretation of
the complex phenomenology shown by polarimetric observations, focusing

force exerted by a planar conductor or dielectric on a self- complementary
perforated planar mirror is approximately half that on a uniform mirror
independent of the distance between them. The BP suggests that Casimir edge
effects are anomalously small, supporting results obtained earlier in special
cases. Finally, we illustrate how the BP can be used to estimate Casimir forces
between perforated planar mirrors.

density fluctuations on the skeleton of the large-scale matter distribution as
mapped through cosmological weak lensing. We computed the skeleton length of
simulated effective convergence maps covering $\sim 35$ sq. deg each, extracted
from a suite of cosmological $n-$body runs with different levels of local
primordial non-Gaussianity. The latter is expected to alter the structure
formation process with respect to the fiducial Gaussian scenario, and thus to
leave a signature on the cosmic web. We found that alterations of the initial
conditions consistently modify both the cumulative and the differential
skeleton length, although the effect is generically smaller than the cosmic
variance and depends on the smoothing of the map prior to the skeleton
computation. Nevertheless, the qualitative shape of these deviations is rather
similar to their primordial counterparts, implying that skeleton statistics
retain good memory of the initial conditions. We performed a statistical
analysis in order to find out at what Confidence Level primordial
non-Gaussianity could be constrained by the skeleton test on cosmic shear maps
of the size we adopted. At 68.3% Confidence Level we found an error on the
measured level of primordial non-Gaussianity of $\Delta f_\mathrm{NL}\sim 300$,
while at 90% Confidence Level it is of $\Delta f_\mathrm{NL}\sim 500$. While
these values by themselves are not competitive with the current constraints,
weak lensing maps larger than those used here would have a smaller
field-to-field variance, and thus would likely lead to tighter constraints. A
rough estimate indicates $\Delta f_\mathrm{NL} \sim$ a few tens at 68.3%
Confidence Level for an all-sky weak lensing survey.

coronary artery stenoses and predict the stability of plaques. Coronary
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a technique that allows visualization
of the coronary arteries by noninvasive means; however, it has not yet reached
a stage where it can be used in routine clinical practice. Although coronary
MRA is a potentially useful diagnostic tool, it has limitations. Further
research should focus on improving the diagnostic resolution and accuracy of
coronary MRA. This paper will helps to cardiologists to take the clear look of
