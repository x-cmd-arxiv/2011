the environment. However, unless special care is taken, experimental errors in
the control pulses used in this technique can destroy the quantum information
instead of preserving it. Here, we investigate techniques for making DD
sequences robust against different types of experimental errors while retaining
good decoupling efficiency in a fluctuating environment. We present
experimental data from solid-state nuclear spin qubits and introduce a new DD
sequence that is suitable for quantum computing and quantum memory.

maps and their usability in algorithmic design. We consider the SINR model,
which compares the received power of a signal at a receiver against the sum of
strengths of other interfering signals plus background noise. To describe the
behavior of a multi-station network, we use the convenient representation of a
\emph{reception map}. In the SINR model, the resulting \emph{SINR diagram}
partitions the plane into reception zones, one per station, and the
complementary region of the plane where no station can be heard. We consider
the general case where transmission energies are arbitrary (or non-uniform).
Under that setting, the reception zones are not necessarily convex or even
connected. This poses the algorithmic challenge of designing efficient point
location techniques as well as the theoretical challenge of understanding the
geometry of SINR diagrams. We achieve several results in both directions. We
establish a form of weaker convexity in the case where stations are aligned on
a line. In addition, one of our key results concerns the behavior of a
$(d+1)$-dimensional map. Specifically, although the $d$-dimensional map might
be highly fractured, drawing the map in one dimension higher ""heals"" the zones,
which become connected. In addition, as a step toward establishing a weaker
form of convexity for the $d$-dimensional map, we study the interference
function and show that it satisfies the maximum principle. Finally, we turn to
consider algorithmic applications, and propose a new variant of approximate

balance of selected magnetic cataclysmic variables, which have shown an extreme

  Aims. We intend to establish the X-ray properties of the system components,
their flux contributions, and the accretion geometry of the X-ray soft polar QS
Tel. In the context of high-resolution X-ray analyses of magnetic cataclysmic
variables, this study will contribute to better understanding the accretion
processes on magnetic white dwarfs.
  Methods. During an intermediate high state of accretion of QS Tel, we have
obtained 20 ks of XMM-Newton data, corresponding to more than two orbital
periods, accompanied by simultaneous optical photometry and phase-resolved
spectroscopy. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectra and light curves and
compare them to former high- and low-state observations.
  Results. Soft emission at energies below 2 keV dominates the X-ray light
curves. The complex double-peaked maxima are disrupted by a sharp dip in the
very soft energy range (0.1-0.5 keV), where the count rate abruptly drops to
zero. The EPIC spectra are described by a minimally absorbed black body at 20
eV and two partially absorbed MEKAL plasma models with temperatures around 0.2
and 3 keV. The black-body-like component arises from one mainly active, soft
X-ray bright accretion region nearly facing the mass donor. Parts of the plasma
emission might be attributed to the second, virtually inactive pole. High
soft-to-hard X-ray flux ratios and hardness ratios demonstrate that the
high-energy emission of QS Tel is substantially dominated by its X-ray soft
component.

involve a lifting operation that turns a relation on states into a relation on

relations can be reconciled to be different presentations of essentially the
same lifting operation. More interestingly, this lifting operation nicely
corresponds to the Kantorovich metric, a fundamental concept used in
mathematics to lift a metric on states to a metric on distributions of states,
besides the fact the lifting operation is related to the maximum flow problem
in optimisation theory.
  The lifting operation yields a neat notion of probabilistic bisimulation, for
which we provide logical, metric, and algorithmic characterisations.
Specifically, we extend the Hennessy-Milner logic and the modal mu-calculus
with a new modality, resulting in an adequate and an expressive logic for
probabilistic bisimilarity, respectively. The correspondence of the lifting
operation and the Kantorovich metric leads to a natural characterisation of
bisimulations as pseudometrics which are post-fixed points of a monotone
function. We also present an ""on the fly"" algorithm to check if two states in a
finitary system are related by probabilistic bisimilarity, exploiting the close

kind of idealized defects. For an excitation energy of $\epsilon_L=2.4$ eV, the
agreement with measurements is very good and calculations reproduce: the
relative intensities among phonon-defect or among two-phonon lines; the
measured small widths of the D, $D'$, 2D and $2D'$ lines; the line shapes; the
presence of small intensity lines in the 1800, 2000 cm$^{-1}$ range. We
determine how the spectra depend on the excitation energy, on the light
polarization, on the electronic linewidth, on the kind of defects and on their
concentration. According to the present findings, the intensity ratio between
the $2D'$ and 2D lines can be used to determine experimentally the electronic
linewidth. The intensity ratio between the $D$ and $D'$ lines depends on the
kind of model defect, suggesting that this ratio could possibly be used to
identify the kind of defects present in actual samples. Charged impurities

the Hohenberg-Kohn lemma which assert that in the ground state to each
inhomogeneous density corresponds only one potential of the external field
cannot be a justification of the existence of the universal density functional
in the general case. At the same time, statements of the density functional
theory remain valid when considering any number of noninteracting ground-state
bosons due to the Bose condensation effect.

couplings are extremely frustrated in the ordered bi-collinear
antiferromagnetic state so that the magnetic transition temperature is low. In
the 122 systems, the formation of iron vacancy order reduces the magnetic
frustration and significantly increases the magnetic transition temperature and
the ordered magnetic moment. The pattern of the 245 iron-vacancy order

central task is evaluation of a new policy given historic data consisting of

Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the doubly robust approach

lines and is consistent with a reddened disk spectrum. Among the emission lines
are three hydrogen series and helium lines, both permitted and forbidden metal
lines, and CO first-overtone emission. A representative sample of lines with
different morphologies is presented. The H alpha and Ca II triplet lines are
very strong, with profiles indicative of outflow and - possibly - infall,
usually observed in accreting stars. These lines include a blue-shifted
absorption component at ~ -125 km/s. The He I and metal-line profiles are
double-peaked, with a likely origin in a circumstellar disk. The forbidden
lines, associated with outflow, have a single blue-shifted emission component
centered at -125 km/s, coinciding with the absorption components in H alpha and
Ca II. SINFONI H- and K-band integral-field spectroscopy of the cluster
environment demonstrates that the [Fe II] emission is produced by a jet
originating at the location of 08576nr292. Because the spectral type of the
central object cannot be determined, its mass remains uncertain. We argue that
08576nr292 is an intermediate-mass YSO with a high accretion rate Mdot_acc ~

whether there are differences among the galaxy populations of these SZE
selected clusters and previously studied clusters selected in the optical and
the X-ray. The radial distributions of galaxies in the four systems are
consistent with NFW profiles with a galaxy concentration of 3 to 6. We show
that the characteristic luminosities in $griz$ bands are consistent with
passively evolving populations emerging from a single burst at redshift $z=3$.
The faint end power law slope of the luminosity function is found to be on
average $\alpha \approx -1.2$ in griz. Halo occupation numbers (to $m^*+2$) for
these systems appear to be consistent with those based on X-ray selected
clusters. The blue fraction estimated to $0.36L^*$, for the three lower
redshift systems, suggests an increase with redshift, although with the current
sample the uncertainties are still large. Overall, this pilot study of the
first four clusters provides no evidence that the galaxy populations in these

the standard nearly scale-invariant spectrum in the form of a generalised
power-law parameterised in terms of the spectral amplitude $A_{\rm s}$, the

The second spectrum is derived from the Lasenby and Doran (LD) model. The LD
model is based on the restriction of the total conformal time available in a
closed Universe and the predicted primordial power spectrum depends upon just
two parameters. An important feature of the LD spectrum is that it naturally
incorporates an exponential fall-off on large scales, which might provide a
possible explanation for the lower-than-expected power observed at low
multipoles in the CMB. In addition to parameter estimation, we compare both
models using Bayesian model selection. We find there is a significant
preference for the LD model over a simple power-law spectrum for a CMB-only

away. This distance encloses several supernova-rich galaxies, so that failed
supernova bursts could be detected at a rate of up to one per decade,
comparable to the expected rate of the more common, but less energetic, neutron
star-forming collapses. Thus, the detection of a failed supernova within the

thin disk stars by applying the X (stellar-population) criterion of Schuster et
al. (1993), which takes into account both kinematic and metallicity
information. For 1906 thin disk and 110 thick disk stars classified in this

orbital eccentricity of (sigma_W, Vphi, e)_thin = (18\pm0.3 km/s, 223\pm0.4

disk scale length in the range 1.5-2.2 kpc, whose greatest uncertainty lies in
the adopted form of the underlying potential. The shape of the orbital
eccentricity distribution indicates that the thick disk stars in our sample
most likely formed in situ with minor gas-rich mergers and/or radial migration
being the most likely cause for their orbits. We further obtain mean metal
abundances of <[M/H]>_thin = +0.03 \pm 0.17, and <[M/H]>_thick = -0.51\pm0.23,
in good agreement with previous estimates. We estimate a radial metallicity
gradient in the thin disk of -0.07 dex/kpc, which is larger than predicted by
chemical evolution models where the disk grows insideout from infalling gas. It
is, however, consistent with models where significant migration of stars shapes
the chemical signature of the disk, implying that radial migration might play
at least part of a role in the thick disk's formation.

parameters should emerge naturally from a description of the expansion of the
universe based on the first principles of quantum field theory and string
theory. Within this general paradigm, one expects that both the gravitational
Newton's coupling, G, and the cosmological term, Lambda, should not be strictly
constant but appear rather as smooth functions of the Hubble rate. This
scenario (""running FLRW model"") predicts, in a natural way, the existence of
dynamical dark energy without invoking the participation of extraneous scalar
fields. In this paper, we perform a detailed study of these models in the light
of the latest cosmological data, which serves to illustrate the
phenomenological viability of the new dark energy paradigm as a serious
alternative to the traditional scalar field approaches. By performing a joint
likelihood analysis of the recent SNIa data, the CMB shift parameter, and the
BAOs traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we put tight constraints on the
main cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically
predicted dark-matter halo mass function and the corresponding redshift
distribution of cluster-size halos for the ""running"" models studied. Despite
the fact that these models closely reproduce the standard LCDM Hubble
expansion, their normalization of the perturbation's power-spectrum varies,
imposing, in many cases, a significantly different cluster-size halo redshift
distribution. This fact indicates that it should be relatively easy to
distinguish between the ""running"" models and the LCDM cosmology using realistic
future X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster surveys.

high-resolution and high signal-to-noise optical spectra of LS2883, the Be star
forming a gamma-ray binary with the young non-accreting pulsar PSR B1259-63,
showing it to rotate faster and be significantly earlier and more luminous than
previously thought. Analysis of the interstellar lines suggest that the system
is located at the same distance as (and thus is likely a member of) CenOB1.
Taking the distance to the association, d=2.3kpc, and a color excess of
E(B-V)=0.85 for LS2883, results in Mv=-4.4. Because of fast rotation, LS2883 is
oblate (R_eq=9.7R_sun and R_pole=8.1R_sun) and presents a temperature gradient
(T_eq=27500K, log g_eq=3.7; T_pole=34000K, log g_pole=4.1). If the star did not
rotate, it would have parameters corresponding to a late O-type star. We
estimate its luminosity at log(L*/L_sun)=4.79, and its mass at M=30M_sun. The
mass function then implies an inclination of the binary system
i_orb=23deg,slightly smaller than previous estimates. We discuss the
implications of these new astrophysical parameters of LS2883 for the production
of high energy and very high energy gamma rays in the PSR B1259-63/LS2883

Telescope (EIT) of solar corona on-board SOHO spacecraft has uncovered a new
class of eruptive events which are often identified as signatures of Coronal
Mass Ejection (CME) initiations on solar disk. It is evident that a crucial
task is the development of an automatic detection tool of CMEs precursors. The
Novel EIT wave Machine Observing (NEMO) (http://sidc.be/nemo) code is an
operational tool that detects automatically solar eruptions using EIT image
sequences. NEMO applies techniques based on the general statistical properties
of the underlying physical mechanisms of eruptive events on the solar disc. In
this work, the most recent updates of NEMO code - that have resulted to the
increase of the recognition efficiency of solar eruptions linked to CMEs - are
presented. These updates provide calculations of the surface of the dimming
region, implement novel clustering technique for the dimmings and set new
criteria to flag the eruptive dimmings based on their complex characteristics.
The efficiency of NEMO has been increased significantly resulting to the
extraction of dimmings observed near the solar limb and to the detection of
small-scale events as well. As a consequence, the detection efficiency of CMEs
precursors and the forecasts of CMEs have been drastically improved.
Furthermore, the catalogues of solar eruptive events that can be constructed by
NEMO may include larger number of physical parameters associated to the dimming
regions.

and infer solar interior properties by inverting these measurements. The
pipeline is used for routine production of near-real-time full-disk maps of
subsurface wave-speed perturbations and horizontal flow velocities for depths
ranging from 0 to 20 Mm, every eight hours. In addition, Carrington synoptic
maps for the subsurface properties are made from these full-disk maps. The
pipeline can also be used for selected target areas and time periods. We
explain details of the pipeline organization and procedures, including
processing of the HMI Doppler observations, measurements of the travel times,
inversions, and constructions of the full-disk and synoptic maps. Some initial
results from the pipeline, including full-disk flow maps, sunspot subsurface
flow fields, and the interior rotation and meridional flow speeds, are
presented.

study the stability of the Bunch-Davies vacuum state for a massless,
conformally coupled interacting test field in de Sitter space. We find that in
$\lambda \phi^4$ theory the vacuum does {\em not} decay, while in
non-conformally invariant models, the vacuum decays as a consequence of a
vacuum wave function renormalization that depends \emph{singularly} on
(conformal) time and is proportional to the spatial volume. In a particular
regularization scheme the vacuum wave function renormalization is the same as
in Minkowski spacetime, but in terms of the \emph{physical volume}, which leads
to an interpretation of the decay. A simple example of the impact of vacuum
decay upon a non-gaussian correlation is discussed. Single particle excitations
also decay into two particle states, leading to particle production that
hastens the exiting of modes from the de Sitter horizon resulting in the
production of \emph{entangled superhorizon pairs} with a population consistent
with unitary evolution. We find a non-perturbative, self-consistent ""screening""
mechanism that shuts off vacuum decay asymptotically, leading to a stationary
vacuum state in a manner not unlike the approach to a fixed point in the space
of states.

biology. Aging is prejudicial to the individual and evolutionary forces should
prevent it, but many species show signs of senescence as individuals age. Here,
I will propose a model for aging based on assumptions that are compatible with
evolutionary theory: i) competition is between individuals; ii) there is some
degree of locality, so quite often competition will between parents and their
progeny; iii) optimal conditions are not stationary, mutation helps each
species to keep competitive. When conditions change, a senescent species can
drive immortal competitors to extinction. This counter-intuitive result arises
from the pruning caused by the death of elder individuals. When there is change
and mutation, each generation is slightly better adapted to the new conditions,
but some older individuals survive by random chance. Senescence can eliminate
those from the genetic pool. Even though individual selection forces always win
over group selection ones, it is not exactly the individual that is selected,
but its lineage. While senescence damages the individuals and has an
evolutionary cost, it has a benefit of its own. It allows each lineage to adapt
faster to changing conditions. We age because the world changes.

the infrared flux method to improve the accuracy of the derived stellar
effective temperatures and uses the latter to build a consistent and improved
metallicity scale. Metallicities are calibrated on high-resolution spectroscopy
and checked against four open clusters and a moving group, showing excellent
consistency. The new temperature and metallicity scales provide a better match
to theoretical isochrones, which are used for a Bayesian analysis of stellar
ages. With respect to previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 K hotter
and 0.1 dex more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicity
distribution function around the solar value. From Stromgren photometry we are
able to derive for the first time a proxy for alpha elements, which enables us
to perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin and thick disc. We find
evidence for the latter being composed of an old, mildly but systematically
alpha-enhanced population that extends to super solar metallicities, in
agreement with spectroscopic studies. Our revision offers the largest existing
kinematically unbiased sample of the solar neighbourhood that contains full
information on kinematics, metallicities, and ages and thus provides better
constraints on the physical processes relevant in the build-up of the Milky Way
disc, enabling a better understanding of the Sun in a Galactic context.

theory side. The correction can be expressed in terms of a thermal mass for the

result to 2-loop order. Hence, the leading correction to the free energy is
non-analytic in the 't Hooft coupling constant lambda. The reason is that the
infrared divergences necessitate a resummation of ring diagrams and a related
reorganization of perturbation theory, in which already the leading correction
receives contributions from all orders in lambda. These results suggest that

substitutional vacancy in graphene. If the second neighbor interaction is large
enough ($t' > t /3$), then the linear Dirac bands no longer occur at the Fermi

only the nearest neighbor interactions present, there is particle-hole

has gained popularity over other communication strategies requiring perfect CSI
thanks to their lower feedback requirements. The amount of feedback in
beamforming based communication systems can be further reduced through
selective feedback techniques in which only the users with channels good enough
are allowed to feed back by means of a decentralized feedback policy. In this
paper, we prove that thresholding at the receiver is the rate-wise optimal
decentralized feedback policy for feedback limited systems with prescribed
feedback constraints. This result is highly adaptable due to its distribution
independent nature, provides an analytical justification for the use of
threshold feedback policies in practical systems, and reinforces previous work
analyzing threshold feedback policies as a selective feedback technique without
proving its optimality. It is robust to selfish unilateral deviations. Finally,
it reduces the search for rate-wise optimal feedback policies subject to
feedback constraints from function spaces to a finite dimensional Euclidean
space.

However, it is difficult to apply the above explanation of filamentation in

same at these distances - the super broad spectrum and the width of the core,
while the power in a stable filament drops to the critical value for
self-focusing. At such power the plasma and higher-order Kerr terms are too
small to prevent self-focusing. We suggest here a new mechanism for stable
soliton pulse propagation in far-away zone, where the power of the laser pulse
is slightly above the critical one, and the pulse comprises super-broad
spectra. For such pulses the diffraction is not paraxial and an initially
symmetric Gaussian pulse takes parabolic form at several diffraction lengths .
The stable soliton propagation appears as a balance between the divergent
parabolic type diffraction of broadband optical pulses and the convergent
nonlinear refractive index due to the intensity profile. We investigate more
precisely the nonlinear third order polarization, using into account the
carrier-to envelope phase. This additional phase transforms the third harmonic
term to THz or GHz one, depending on the spectral width of the pulse.

theory. We examine the energy spectrum and density of states. It is found that
gaps open in the quasi-energy spectrum due to the single-photon/multi-photon
resonances. These quasi-energy gaps are pronounced at small momentum, but
decrease dramatically with the increase of momentum and finally tend to be
closed when the momentum is large enough. Due to the contribution from the
states at large momentum, the gaps in the density of states are effectively
closed, in contrast to the prediction in the previous work by Oka and Aoki
[Phys. Rev. B {\bf 79}, 081406(R) (2009)]. We also investigate the optical
conductivity for different field strengths and Fermi energies, and show the

discovered that the optical conductivity exhibits a multi-step-like structure
due to the sideband-modulated optical transition. It is also shown that dips
appear at frequencies being the integer numbers of the applied terahertz field
frequency in the case of low Fermi energy, originating from the quasi-energy

radio jets of SS433 and an ambient medium has been often invoked in
interpretations of the jets behaviour. The dynamical interaction could be
responsible for disagreements between the kinematic model and observations of
the jets. To estimate the relative ram pressure of the jet and impinging matter
we used the profile along the radio jets of brightness of synchrotron
radiation. From this we estimated magnitude of possible deceleration and
twisting of the jets, and compare model locus of the jets with observations.
The magnitude is enough big to be observed, that addresses an applicability of
the kinematic model, based mostly on the optical observations, to the radio
jets and a problem of the kinematic distance to the object in particular.

the globular clusters (GCs) can be explained assuming that a second generation
(SG) of stars form in the gas ejected by the asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars belonging to a first stellar generation. However, while Na and O appear
to be anticorrelated in the cluster stars, from the stellar models they turn
out to be correlated into the AGB ejecta. In order to reconcile the stellar
theory with the observational findings, all the GC models invoke an early
dilution of AGB ejecta with pristine gas occurring during the SG formation.
Despite a vast consensus about the occurrence of such dilution, the physical
process behind it is still unknown. In the present paper we set some general
constraints on the pristine gas dynamics and on the possible amount of pristine
gas involved in the SG formation, making use of a one zone chemical model. We
find that such a dilution is a necessary ingredient in the SG star formation to
explain the observed abundance patterns. We confirm the conclusion of our
previous works showing that clusters must have been initially much more
massive. We also show that models assuming that clusters had an initial mass
similar to their current one, and adopting a large fraction of pristine gas to
form SG stars, fail to reproduce the observed Na-O anticorrelation and are not
viable. We finally show that the dilution event should be restricted in time,
rather than extended for the all duration of the SG formation.

retrieve the astrophysical null depth (or equivalently the object's visibility)

accuracy much better (about an order of magnitude) than is presently possible
with standard data reduction methods, because the astrophysical null depth
accuracy is no longer limited by the magnitude of the instrumental phase and
intensity errors but by uncertainties on their probability distributions. This
approach was tested on the sky with the two-aperture fiber nulling instrument
mounted on the Palomar Hale telescope. Using our new data analysis approach
alone-and no observations of calibrators-we find that error bars on the
astrophysical null depth as low as a few 10-4 can be obtained in the
near-infrared, which means that null depths lower than 10-3 can be reliably
measured. This statistical analysis is not specific to our instrument and may
be applicable to other interferometers.

  December 2010",,,,"math.PR cond-mat.stat-mech math-ph math.CV math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bessel process is defined as the radial part of the Brownian motion (BM) in
the $D$-dimensional space, and is considered as a one-parameter family of
one-dimensional diffusion processes indexed by $D$, BES$^{(D)}$. It is
well-known that $D_{\rm c}=2$ is the critical dimension. Bessel flow is a
notion such that we regard BES$^{(D)}$ with a fixed $D$ as a one-parameter
family of initial value. There is another critical dimension $\bar{D}_{\rm
c}=3/2$ and, in the intermediate values of $D$, $\bar{D}_{\rm c} < D < D_{\rm
c}$, behavior of Bessel flow is highly nontrivial. The dimension D=3 is
special, since in addition to the aspect that BES$^{(3)}$ is a radial part of
the three-dimensional BM, it has another aspect as a conditional BM to stay
positive. Two topics in probability theory and statistical mechanics, the
Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and the Dyson model (Dyson's BM model with
parameter $\beta=2$), are discussed. The SLE$^{(D)}$ is introduced as a
'complexification' of Bessel flow on the upper-half complex-plane. The Dyson
model is introduced as a multivariate extension of BES$^{(3)}$. We explain the
'parenthood' of BES$^{(D)}$ and SLE$^{(D)}$, and that of BES$^{(3)}$ and the
Dyson model. It is shown that complex analysis is effectively applied to study
stochastic processes and statistical mechanics models in equilibrium and
nonequilibrium states.

field K which is contained in the ring of integers of K. The order O is called
monogenic, if it is of the shape Z[w], i.e., generated over the rational
integers by one element. By a result of Gy\H{o}ry (1976), the set of w with
Z[w]=O is a union of finitely many equivalence classes, where two elements v,w
of O are called equivalent if v+w or v-w is a rational integer. An order O is
called k times monogenic if there are at least k different equivalence classes
of w with Z[w]=O, and precisely k times monogenic if there are precisely k such
equivalence classes. It is known that every quadratic order is precisely one
time monogenic, while in number fields of degree larger than 2, there may be
non-monogenic orders. In this paper we study orders which are more than one
time monogenic. Our first main result is, that in any number field K of degree
at least 3 there are only finitely many three times monogenic orders. Next, we
define two special types of two times monogenic orders, and show that there are
number fields K which have infinitely many orders of these types. Then under
certain conditions imposed on the Galois group of the normal closure of K, we
prove that K has only finitely many two times monogenic orders which are not of
these types. We give some immediate applications to canonical number systems.
Further, we prove extensions of our results for domains which are monogenic
over a given domain A of characteristic 0 which is finitely generated over Z.

a systematic difference in [alpha/Fe] at a given metallicity. In continuation

sample of stars. Equivalent widths of atomic lines are measured from high
resolution VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra and used to derive precise abundance
ratios from an LTE analysis based on MARCS model atmospheres. Systematic
differences between the `high-alpha' and `low-alpha' halo populations are found
for [Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y], whereas there is no significant difference in
the case of [Mn/Fe]. At a given metallicity, [Cu/Fe] shows a large scatter that
is closely correlated with a corresponding scatter in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe]. The
metallicity trends of [Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y] can be explained from
existing nucleosynthesis calculations if the high-alpha stars formed in regions
with such a high star formation rate that only massive stars and Type II
supernovae contributed to the chemical enrichment. The low-alpha stars, on the
other hand, most likely originate from systems with a slower chemical
evolution, characterized by additional enrichment from Type Ia supernovae and
low-mass AGB stars.

a systematic unnatural behaviour of the metric functions in the asymptotic

inequivalent spin structures on arbitrary curved spacetimes, which induces an
additional term on the associated Dirac operator, related to a Cech cohomology
class. For the most kinds of spinor fields, any exotic term in the Dirac
operator can be absorbed and encoded as a shift of the electromagnetic vector
potential representing an element of the cohomology group H^1(M, Z_2). The
possibility of concealing such an exotic term does not exist in case of dark
(ELKO) spinor fields, as they cannot carry electromagnetic charge, so that the
full topological analysis must be evaluated. Since exotic dark spinor fields
also satisfy Klein-Gordon propagators, the dynamical constraints related to the
exotic term in the Dirac equation can be explicitly calculated. It forthwith
implies that the non-trivial topology associated to the spacetime can
drastically engender --- from the dynamics of dark spinor fields ---
constraints in the spacetime metric structure. Meanwhile, such constraints may
be alleviated, at the cost of constraining the exotic spacetime topology.
Besides being prime candidates to the dark matter problem, dark spinor fields
are shown to be potential candidates to probe non-trivial topologies in
spacetime, as well as probe the spacetime metric structure.

arise during free diffusion in fluids and theoretical analysis has been carried

extremely weak, in terms of amplitude of the fluctuations and of corrugation of
the diffusion wave fronts. In this paper, we show that the phenomena strongly
depends on the dimensionality of the system: by extending the theory to two
dimensional systems, we show that the root mean square amplitude of the

present an evaluation of the Hausdorf dimension of the expected fluctuations.
Experimentally, two-dimensional liquid systems can be realised as freely

by the fluids (e.g. air) surrounding the film. We provide an evaluation of the
drag on the fluctuations. In particular, we study the case of a concentration

coefficient of dynamic friction between the surface and the wheels which
facilitates the measurement of the coefficient of dynamic friction. (iii) The
equation of motion of a fixed torque mass shedding vehicle moving against

equivalent to motion of a mass shedding rocket moving by applying fixed force
against atmospheric friction. (iv) The equation of the path of a missile

These feed an IDL tool (CSP) that we designed to simulate the datacube
resulting from the SPHERE IFS. We performed simulations under different
conditions to evaluate the contrast that IFS will be able to reach and to
verify the impact of physical propagation within the limits of the near field
of the aperture approximation (i.e. Fresnel propagation). We then performed a
series of simulations containing planet images to test the capability of our
instrument to correctly classify the found objects. To this purpose we
developed a separated IDL tool. Results. We found that using the SPHERE IFS
instrument and appropriate analysis techniques, such as multiple spectral
differential imaging (MDI), spectral deconvolution (SD), and angular
differential imaging (ADI), we should be able to image companion objects down
to a luminosity contrast of ? 10-7 with respect to the central star in
favorable cases. Spectral deconvolution resulted in the most effective method
for reducing the speckle noise. We were then able to find most of the simulated
planets (more than 90% with the Y-J-mode and more than the 95% with the
Y-H-mode) for contrasts down to 3 \times 10-7 and separations between 0.3 and
1.0 arcsec. The spectral classification is accurate but seems to be more
precise for late T-type spectra than for earlier spectral types. A possible
degeneracy between early L-type companion objects and field objects (flat
spectra) is highlighted. The spectral classification seems to work better using
the Y-H-mode than with the Y-J-mode.

analysis of the massive early-type galaxy SDSS J1148+1930 at redshift z=0.444.
We combine its extended kinematic profile -derived from spectra obtained with
X-shooter on the ESO VLT- with strong gravitational lensing and multi-color
information derived from SDSS images. Our main results are (i) The
luminosity-weighted stellar velocity dispersion is \sigma *(<Reff) = 351\pm10
km/s, extracted from a rectangular aperture of 1.8""x1.6"", more accurate and
considerably lower than a previously published value of \sim450km/s. (ii) A
single-component (stellar plus dark) mass model of the lens galaxy yields a
logarithmic total-density slope of {\gamma}' = 1.72+0.05-0.06. (iii) The
projected stellar mass fraction, derived solely from lensing, is f*(<Reff) =
0.19+0.04-0.09 inside the Einstein radius for a Hernquist profile and no
anisotropy. The dark-matter fraction inside the effective radius f_DM(<Reff) =
0.60+0.15\pm0.1. (iv) Based on the SDSS colors, we find f*(<Reff)=0.17 \pm 0.06
for a Salpeter IMF and f*(<Reff)=0.07 \pm 0.02 for a Chabrier IMF. The lensing
and dynamics constraints on the stellar mass fraction agree well with those
independently derived from the SDSS colors for a Salpeter IMF, preferred over
Chabrier IMF at variance with standard results for lower mass galaxies.
Dwarf-rich IMFs in the lower mass range of 0.1-0.7 solar mass, with {\alpha} >=
3 (with dN/dM \propto M^(-{\alpha})) -such as that recently suggested for
massive ETGs- are excluded at the > 90 % C.L. and in some cases violate the
total lensing-derived mass limit. We conclude that this very massive ETG is
dark-matter dominated inside one effective radius, consistent with the trend
recently found from massive SLACS galaxies, with a IMF normalization consistent
with Salpeter.

($n_t$ symbols per channel use) using partial channel state information at the

through an optimization over the choice of constellation sets. The optimization
maximizes $d_{min}^2$ for our precoding scheme subject to an energy constraint.
The scheme requires feedback of $n_t-1$ angle parameter values, compared to
$2n_tn_r$ real coefficients in case of full CSIT. Error rate performance
results for $3\times 1$, $3\times 2$, $4\times 1$, $8\times 1$ precoded MIMO
systems (with $n_t=3,3,4,8$ symbols per channel use, respectively) show that
the proposed precoding achieves 3rd, 6th, 4th and 8th order diversities,
respectively. These performances are shown to be better than other precoding
schemes in the literature; the better performance is due to the choice of the
signal sets and the feedback angles in the proposed scheme.

logical-style characterization and lead to irredundant bases of absolutely

intuitive notion of interest of an association rule, in terms of its ""novelty""
with respect to other rules. Namely: an irredundant rule is so because its
confidence is higher than what the rest of the rules would suggest; then, one
can ask: how much higher? We propose to measure such a sort of ""novelty""
through the confidence boost of a rule, which encompasses two previous similar
notions (confidence width and rule blocking, of which the latter is closely
related to the earlier measure ""improvement""). Acting as a complement to
confidence and support, the confidence boost helps to obtain small and crisp
sets of mined association rules, and solves the well-known problem that, in
certain cases, rules of negative correlation may pass the confidence bound. We
analyze the properties of two versions of the notion of confidence boost, one
of them a natural generalization of the other. We develop efficient
algorithmics to filter rules according to their confidence boost, compare the
concept to some similar notions in the bibliography, and describe the results
of some experimentation employing the new notions on standard benchmark
datasets. We describe an open-source association mining tool that embodies one

performed, we analyse the gauge of the local observer, which represents the
gauge of a laboratory environment on Earth. The gauge-invariance between the
two gauges is shown in its full angular and frequency dependences. In previous
works in the literature this gauge-invariance was shown only in the low
frequencies approximation or in the simplest geometry of the interferometer
with respect to the propagating GW (i.e. both of the arms of the interferometer
are perpendicular to the propagating GW). Second, as far as the computation of
the response functions in the gauge of the local observer is concerned, a
common misconception about interferometers is also clarified. Such a
misconception purports that, as the wavelength of laser light and the length of
an interferometer's arm are both stretched by a GW, no effect should be
visible, invoking an analogy with cosmological redshift in an expanding

to include more involved erasure correction coding among messages, thus
revealing an inherent connection between broadcast with common message and

limited lifetime issues, sensors may be powered via energy harvesting and thus
collect all the energy they need from the environment. This work addresses the
problem of energy allocation over source acquisition/compression and
transmission for energy-harvesting sensors. At first, focusing on a
single-sensor, energy management policies are identified that guarantee a
maximal average distortion while at the same time ensuring the stability of the
queue connecting source and channel encoders. It is shown that the identified
class of policies is optimal in the sense that it stabilizes the queue whenever
this is feasible by any other technique that satisfies the same average

resource optimization for the source and channel encoders. Analog transmission
techniques as well as suboptimal strategies that do not use the energy buffer

allocation are also studied for performance comparison. The problem of
optimizing the desired trade-off between average distortion and delay is then
formulated and solved via dynamic programming tools. Finally, a system with

derived that are able to maintain the stability of all data queues and to meet

Local Group dynamics and a gateway to the dark matter profiles of galaxies in
general. Our survey for water masers selected 206 luminous compact 24
micron-emitting regions in M31 and was sensitive enough to detect any maser
useful for ~10 microarcsecond per year astrometry. The newly discovered masers
span the isotropic luminosity range 0.3-1.9 x 10^-3 L(Sun) in single spectral
components and are analogous to luminous Galactic masers. The masers are
distributed around the molecular ring, including locations close to the major
and minor axes, which is nearly ideal for proper motion studies. We find no
correlation between 24 micron luminosity and water maser luminosity, suggesting
that while water masers arise in star-forming regions, the nonlinear
amplification pathways and beamed nature of the water masers means that they
are not predictable based on IR luminosity alone. This suggests that there are
additional bright masers to be found in M31. We predict that the geometric

and robust radio morphology classifications assembled to date, we investigate
quasar radio and optical properties with unprecedented statistical power. The
data consist of 4714 radio quasars from FIRST with S_{20}>2mJy and SDSS
spectra. Radio morphology classes include core-only (core), core-lobe (lobe),
core-jet (jet), lobe-core-lobe (triple), and double-lobe. We examine the
optical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars with
core emission unresolved by FIRST (on 5"" scale) have a redder color
distribution than radio-quiet quasars (S_{20}<1mJy); other classes of radio
quasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars.
This analysis also suggests that optical colors of z<2.7 SDSS quasars are not
strongly (<0.1mag) biased blue. We show that the radio core-to-lobe flux
density ratio (R) and the radio-to-optical (i-band) ratio of the quasar core
(RI) are correlated, suggesting that both parameters are indicative of
line-of-sight orientation. We investigate spectral line equivalent widths as a
function of R and RI, including the [OIII] narrow line doublet and the CIV
{\lambda}1549 and MgII {\lambda}2799 broad lines. We find that the rest
equivalent widths (EWs) of the broad lines correlate positively with RI at the
4-8{\sigma} level. But we find no strong dependence of EW on R, in contrast to
previous results. One interpretation is that EWs increase as the line-of-sight
angle to the radio-jet axis decreases. These results are in stark contrast to
commonly accepted orientation-based theories, which suggest that continuum
emission should increase as the angle to the radio-jet axis decreases,
resulting in smaller EW of emission lines (assumed isotropic). Finally, we find
that the Baldwin effect in our sample does not depend on quasar radio
morphology.

  properties of In$_2$O$_3$:Sn thin films","Submitted to the Journal of Applied Physics",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrical conductivity, Hall effect and magnetoresistance of In$_2$O$_3$:Sn
thin films deposited on a glass substrates at different temperatures and oxygen
pressures, as well as the films treated in a hydrogen plasma, have been
investigated in the temperature range 1.5-300 K. The observed temperature
dependences of resistivity were typical for metallic transport of electrons
except temperature dependence of resistivity of the In$_2$O$_3$:Sn film
deposited in the oxygen deficient atmosphere. The electron concentration and
mobility for the film deposited at 230$^\circ$C was larger than that for the
film deposited nominally at room temperature. Short (5 minutes) treatment of
the films in hydrogen plasma leads to the enhancement of electrical
conductivity while longer (30 minute) treatment has the opposite effect. The
electrical measurements were accompanied by AFM and SEM studies of structural
properties, as well as by XPS analysis. Basic on structural and electrical
measurements we conclude the reduction process initiated by the hydrogen plasma
provides essential modification of the ITO films surface. At the same time,
electrical properties of the remaining (located beneath the surface layer)
parts of the ITO films remain mostly unchangeable. XPS analysis shows that
grown in situ oxygen deficient ITO films have enhanced DOS between the Fermi
level and the valence band edge. The extra localized states behave as acceptors
leading to a compensation of $n$-type ITO. That can explain lower $n$-type
conductivity in this material crossing over to a Mott-type hopping.

  presentation)","Modern Physics Letters A 27, No. 2 (2012) 1230003","10.1142/S0217732312300030","CERN-PH-TH-2011-044","hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Within a two-loop leading-log approximation, we review the prediction for the
lightest Higgs mass (m_h) in the framework of constrained MSSM (CMSSM), derived
from the naturalness requirement of minimal fine-tuning (Delta) of the
electroweak scale and dark matter consistency. As a result, the Higgs mass is
predicted to be just above the LEP2 bound, m_h=115.9\pm 2 GeV, corresponding to
a minimal Delta=17.8, value obtained from consistency with electroweak and WMAP
(3\sigma) constraints, but without the LEP2 bound. Due to quantum corrections
(largely QCD ones for m_h above LEP2 bound), Delta grows \approx exponentially
on either side of the above value of m_h, which stresses the relevance of this
prediction. A value m_h>121 (126) GeV cannot be accommodated within the CMSSM
unless one accepts a fine-tuning cost worse than Delta>100 (1000),
respectively. We review how the above prediction for m_h and Delta changes
under the addition of new physics beyond the MSSM Higgs sector, parametrized by
effective operators of dimensions d=5 and d=6. For d=5 operators, one can
obtain values m_h\leq 130 GeV for Delta<10. The size of the supersymmetric
correction that each individual operator of d=6 brings to the value of m_h for
points with Delta<100, is found to be small, of few (<4) GeV for M=8 TeV, where
M is the scale of new physics. This value decreases (increases) by
approximately 1 GeV for a 1 TeV increase (decrease) of the scale M. The
relation of these results to the Atlas/CMS supersymmetry exclusion limits is
presented together with their impact for the CMSSM regions of lowest
fine-tuning.

  theory","172 pages",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper studies representation theoretic aspects of a nonabelian version of
the Jacobian for a smooth complex projective surface $X$ introduced in [R1].
The sheaf of reductive Lie algebras $\bf\calG$ associated to the nonabelian
Jacobian is determined and its Lie algebraic properties are explicitly related
to the geometry of configurations of points on $X$. In particular, it is shown
that the subsheaf of centers of $\bf\calG$ determines a distinguished
decomposition of configurations into the disjoint union of subconfigurations.
Furthermore, it is shown how to use $sl_2$-subalgebras associated to certain
nilpotent elements of $\bf\calG$ to write equations defining configurations of
$X$ in appropriate projective spaces. The same nilpotent elements are used to
establish a relation of the nonabelian Jacobian with such fundamental objects
in the representation theory as nilpotent orbits, Springer resolution and
Springer fibres of simple Lie algebras of type $A_n$, for appropriate values of
$n$. This leads to a construction of distinguished collections of objects in
the category of representations of symmetric groups as well as in the category
of perverse sheaves on the appropriate Hilbert schemes of points of $X$. Hence
two ways of categorifying the second Chern class of vector bundles of rank 2 on
smooth projective surfaces. We also give a `loop' version of the above
construction by relating the nonabelian Jacobian to the Infinite Grassmannians
of simple Lie groups of type $SL_n(\bf C)$, for appropriate values of n. This
gives, via the geometric version of the Satake isomorphism, a distinguished
collection of irreducible representations of the Langlands dual groups thus
indicating a relation of the nonabelian Jacobian to the Langlands duality for
smooth projective surfaces.
