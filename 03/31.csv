nonlinear MHD turbulence in accretion disks. However, confidence in their
quantitative predictions requires a demonstration that further refinement of
the spatial gridscale would not result in any significant change. This has yet
to be accomplished, particularly for global disk simulations. In this paper, we
combine data from previously published stratified shearing box simulations and
new global disk simulations to calibrate several quantitative diagnostics by
which one can estimate progress toward numerical convergence. Using these
diagnostics, we find that the established criterion for an adequate numerical
description of linear growth of the magneto-rotational instability (the number
of cells across a wavelength of the fastest-growing vertical wavenumber mode)
can be extended to a criterion for adequate description of nonlinear MHD disk
turbulence, but the standard required is more stringent. We also find that
azimuthal resolution, which has not often been extensively examined in previous
studies, can significantly affect the evolution of the poloidal magnetic field.
We further analyze the comparative resolution requirements of a small sample of
initial magnetic field geometries; not surprisingly, more complicated initial
field geometries require higher spatial resolution. Otherwise, they tend to
evolve to qualitatively similar states if evolved for sufficient time. Applying
our quantitative resolution criteria to a sample of previously published global
simulations, we find that, with perhaps a single exception, they are
significantly under-resolved, and therefore underestimate the magnetic
turbulence and resulting stress levels throughout the accretion flow.

equivalent. Indeed, when restricted to nearest-neighbor hopping on a chain the
particles cannot exchange themselves, and therefore hardly experience their own
statistics. Apart from the off-diagonal correlations which depends on the
so-called Jordan-Wigner string, real-space observables are similar for
free-fermions and hard-core bosons on a chain. Interestingly, by coupling only
two chains, thus forming a two-leg ladder, particle exchange becomes allowed,
and leads to a totally different physics between free-fermions and hard-core
bosons. Using a combination of analytical (strong coupling, field theory,
renormalization group) and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, density-matrix
renormalization group) approaches, we study the apparently simple but
non-trivial model of hard-core bosons hopping in a two-leg ladder geometry. At
half-filling, while a band insulator appears for fermions at large interchain
hopping tperp >2t only, a Mott gap opens up for bosons as soon as tperp\neq0
through a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Away from half-filling, the situation
is even more interesting since a gapless Luttinger liquid mode emerges in the
symmetric sector with a non-trivial filling-dependent Luttinger parameter

between the cumulative curves (in L2 metrics) is very sensitive to structural
breaks since it accumulates true differences and suppresses uncorrelated noise
and systematic errors. Our previous model of inflation and unemployment in
Canada is enhanced by the introduction of structural breaks and is validated by
new data in the past and future. The most exiting finding is that the
introduction of inflation targeting as a new monetary policy in 1991 resulted

radius is well constrained at about 0.64 Solar radii. The line profile
asymmetry can be reproduced by either a spiral-arm structure or an eccentric

ultracold atoms, leading to rapid advances in a vast array of fields.
Unfortunately laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of
their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules
potentially useful for many applications. For example, heteronuclear molecules
possess permanent electric dipole moments which lead to long-range, tunable,
anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole-dipole
interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible
at ultracold temperatures make ultracold molecules attractive candidates for
use in quantum simulation of condensed matter systems and quantum computation.
Also ultracold molecules may provide unique opportunities for studying chemical
dynamics and for tests of fundamental symmetries. Here we experimentally
demonstrate laser cooling of the molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF). Using
an optical cycling scheme requiring only three lasers, we have observed both
Sisyphus and Doppler cooling forces which have substantially reduced the
transverse temperature of a SrF molecular beam. Currently the only technique
for producing ultracold molecules is by binding together ultracold alkali atoms
through Feshbach resonance or photoassociation. By contrast, different proposed
applications for ultracold molecules require a variety of molecular
energy-level structures. Our method provides a new route to ultracold
temperatures for molecules. In particular it bridges the gap between ultracold
temperatures and the ~1 K temperatures attainable with directly cooled
molecules (e.g. cryogenic buffer gas cooling or decelerated supersonic beams).
Ultimately our technique should enable the production of large samples of
molecules at ultracold temperatures for species that are chemically distinct
from bialkalis.

Here we study numerically the steady states and switching hydrodynamics of blue

When the field is on, there are three regimes: for very weak fields (and strong
anchoring at the boundaries) the blue phases are almost unaffected, for
intermediate fields the disclinations twist (for BPI) and unzip (for BPII),
whereas for very large voltages the network dissolves in the bulk of the cell.
Interestingly, we find that a BPII cell can recover its original structure when
the field is switched off, whereas a BPI cell is found to be trapped more
easily into metastable configurations. The kinetic pathways followed during
switching on and off entails dramatic reorganisation of the disclination
networks. We also discuss the effect of changing the director field anchoring
at the boundary planes and of varying the direction of the applied field.

often used. We present comparisons between these proxies and the full
integrated collision rate for King models. Gamma, defined to be rho_0^3/2
r_c^2$, where $\rho_0$ is the central cluster density, and r_c is the core
radius, is an accurate representation of the collision rate from the King model
to within about 25% for all but the least concentrated clusters. Gamma_h,
defined to be rho_h^3/2 r_h^2, where rho_h is the average density within the
half-light radius, and $r_h$ is the half-light radius, is only marginally
better correlated with the full King model collision rate than is the cluster
luminosity. The two galaxies where results of King model fitting have been
reported in detail show a dearth of core-collapsed clusters relative to that
seen in the Milky Way, indicating that the core radii of the most concentrated
clusters are probably slightly overestimated. Recent work has suggested that
shallower than linear relations exist between proxies for Gamma and the
probability that a cluster will contain an X-ray source; we show that there is
a similarly shallow relationship between Gamma and Gamma_h; we also show that
measurement errors are likely to produce a shallower than linear relationship
even when Gamma itself is used. The evidence is thus consistent with the idea
that X-ray binary formation rates are linearly proportional to cluster
collision rates. We also find, through comparison with multimass models,
suggestive evidence that the retention fractions of neutron stars in globular
clusters may be related to the present day concentration parameters, which
would imply that the most concentrated clusters today were the most
concentrated clusters at the time of their supernovae.

non-renormalizable operators involving a GUT group and $U(1)_H$ non-singlet
Higgs field are introduced. Thus the GUT gauge symmetry breaking and the
generation of hierarchical flavor hierarchy have a common origin in this
mechanism. In this Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, we propose
universality conditions for coefficients corresponding to different
contractions in the group productions. We find that the predictions in
Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism for SU(5) GUT is different to that of
ordinary Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Such Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen
mechanism can be used in GUT models when ordinary Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism is
no longer available. We study the application of Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen
mechanism in SO(10) model. We find that realistic standard model mass hierarchy
and mixings can be obtained both in SU(5) and SO(10) GUT models with such
Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism.

supermassive black holes and their host galaxies have suggested that in the
past black holes constituted a larger fraction of their host galaxies' mass.
However, these arguments are limited by selection effects and difficulties in
determining robust host galaxy masses at high redshifts. Here we report the
first results of a new, complementary diagnostic route: we directly determine a
dynamical host galaxy mass for the z=1.3 luminous quasar J090543.56+043347.3
through high-spatial-resolution (0.47"", 4kpc FWHM) observations of the host
galaxy gas kinematics over 30x40 kpc using ESO/VLT/SINFONI with LGS/AO.
Combining our result of M_dyn = 2.05+1.68_0.74 x 10^11 M_sun (within a radius
5.25 +- 1.05 kpc) with M_BH,MgII = 9.02 \pm 1.43 x 10^8 M_sun, M_BH,Halpha =
2.83 +1.93-1.13 x 10^8 M_sun, we find that the ratio of black hole mass to host
galaxy dynamical mass for J090543.56+043347.3 matches the present-day relation
for M_BH vs. M_Bulge,Dyn, well within the IR scatter, deviating at most a
factor of two from the mean. J090543.56+043347.3 displays clear signs of an
ongoing tidal interaction and of spatially extended star formation at a rate of
50-100 M_sun/yr, above the cosmic average for a galaxy of this mass and
redshift. We argue that its subsequent evolution may move J090543.56+043347.3
even closer to the z=0 relation for M_BH vs. M_Bulge,Dyn. Our results support
the picture where any substantive evolution in these relations must occur prior
to z~1.3. Having demonstrated the power of this modelling approach we are
currently analyzing similar data on seven further objects to better constrain
such evolution.

polarization for the primary component of the very active RS CVn binary HR 1099

of linear polarization signatures is measured to be ~10^{-4} of the unpolarized
continuum, which is approximately a factor of ten lower than for circular
polarization. This is the first detection of the linear polarization in line
profiles of cool active stars. Our observations of the inactive solar-like star
alpha Cen A show neither circular nor linear polarization above the level of
10^{-5}, indicating the absence of a net longitudinal magnetic field stronger

matter LCDM universe have traditionally failed to yield realistic candidates.
Here we report a new cosmological N-body/SPH simulation of extreme dynamic
range in which a close analog of a Milky Way disk galaxy arises naturally.
Termed Eris, the simulation follows the assembly of a galaxy halo of mass
Mvir=7.9x10^11 Msun with a total of N=18.6 million particles (gas + dark matter
+ stars) within the final virial radius, and a force resolution of 120 pc. It
includes radiative cooling, heating from a cosmic UV field and supernova
explosions, a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold
(nSF=5 atoms cm^-3 rather than the canonical nSF=0.1 atoms cm^-3), and neglects
AGN feedback. At the present epoch, the simulated galaxy has an extended
rotationally-supported disk with a radial scale length Rd=2.5 kpc, a gently
falling rotation curve with circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lenghts of
V2.2=214 km/s, a bulge-to-disk ratio B/D=0.35, and a baryonic mass fraction
that is 30% below the cosmic value. The disk is thin, is forming stars in the
region of the Sigma_SFR - Sigma_HI plane occupied by spiral galaxies, and falls
on the photometric Tully-Fisher and the stellar mass-halo virial mass
relations. Hot (T>3x10^5 K), X-ray luminous halo gas makes only 26% of the
universal baryon fraction and follows a flattened density profile proportional
to r^-1.13 out to r=100 kpc. Eris appears then to be the first cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation in which the galaxy structural properties, the mass
budget in the various components, and the scaling relations between mass and
luminosity are all consistent with a host of observational constraints.

multiple levels of refinements for cosmological ""zoom-in"" simulations. The
method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real space
transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to
generate displacements and velocities following first (1LPT) or second order
Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves RMS relative
errors of order 10^(-4) for displacements and velocities in the refinement
region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude
over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine
boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space induced interference ringing.
An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is
introduced which has identical Fourier space behaviour as traditional
approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our real
space based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density
profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level
accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for two-component baryon and
dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in
excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density
fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to
generate a density field for mesh based codes that is consistent with
Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the
Eulerian linearly scaled densities.

the ""core shift"") was predicted more than three decades ago and has since been
observed in a few sources, but often within a narrow frequency range. This
effect has important astrophysical and astrometric applications. To achieve a
broader understanding of the core shift effect and the physics behind it, we
conducted a dedicated survey with NRAO's Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We
used the VLBA to image 20 pre-selected sources simultaneously at nine
frequencies in the 1.4-15.4 GHz range. The core position at each frequency was
measured by referencing it to a bright, optically thin feature in the jet. A
significant core shift has been successfully measured in each of the twenty
sources observed. The median value of the core shift is found to be 1.21 mas if
measured between 1.4 and 15.4 GHz, and 0.24 mas between 5.0 and 15.4 GHz. The
core position, r, as a function of frequency, n, is found to be consistent with
an r n^-1 law. This behavior is predicted by the Blandford & Koenigl model of a
purely synchrotron self-absorbed conical jet in equipartition. No systematic
deviation from unity of the power law index in the r(n) relation has been
convincingly detected. We conclude that neither free-free absorption nor
gradients in pressure and/or density in the jet itself and in the ambient
medium surrounding the jet play a significant role in the sources observed
within the 1.4-15.4 GHz frequency range. These results support the
interpretation of the parsec-scale core as a continuous Blandford-Koenigl type
jet with smooth gradients of physical properties along it.

$\mu$-$B_\mu$ problem of gauge mediation. In fact, it allows for accommodating,
with no further parameter tuning, large values of $B_\mu$ and of the other
Higgs-sector soft masses, as predicted in models where both $\mu$ and $B_\mu$
are generated at one-loop order. This class of models, called Lopsided Gauge
Mediation, offers an interesting alternative to conventional gauge mediation
and is characterized by a strikingly different phenomenology, with light
higgsinos, very large Higgs pseudoscalar mass, and moderately light sleptons.
We discuss general parametric relations involving the fine-tuning of the model
and various observables such as the chargino mass and the value of $\tan\beta$.
We build an explicit model and we study the constraints coming from LEP and
Tevatron. We show that in spite of new interactions between the Higgs and the
messenger superfields, the theory can remain perturbative up to very large
scales, thus retaining gauge coupling unification.

With a fixed amount of spectroscopic follow-up time, we find that deeper
magnitude-limited spectroscopic surveys are better for producing training sets.
For supernova Ia (II-P) typing, we obtain a 44% (1%) increase in purity to 72%
(87%) and 30% (162%) increase in efficiency to 65% (84%) of the sample using a
25th (24.5th) magnitude-limited survey instead of the shallower spectroscopic
sample used in the original simulations. When redshift information is
available, we incorporate it into our analysis using a novel method of altering
the diffusion map representation of the supernovae. Incorporating host
redshifts leads to a 5% improvement in Type Ia purity and 13% improvement in
Type Ia efficiency.

ionised system, e.g., an interstellar molecular cloud. We determine all the
critical wavelengths of perturbations across which the sustainable wave modes
can change radically (and so can their decay rates), and various instabilities
are present or absent. These critical wavelengths are essential for
understanding the effects of MHD waves (or turbulence) on the structure and
evolution of molecular clouds. Depending on the angle of propagation relative
to the magnetic field and the physical parameters of a cloud, there are
wavelength ranges in which no wave can be sustained as such. Yet, for other
directions of propagation or different properties of a model cloud, there may
exist some wave mode(s) at all wavelengths. For a typical cloud,
magnetically-driven ambipolar diffusion leads to removal of any support against
gravity that most short-wavelength waves (or turbulence) may have had, and
gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion sets in and leads to cloud
fragmentation into stellar-size masses, as first suggested by Mouschovias three
decades ago -- a single-stage fragmentation theory of star formation, distinct
from the hierarchical fragmentation picture. Phase velocities, decay times, and
eigenvectors (the densities and velocities of neutral particles and the plasma,
and components of the magnetic field) are determined as functions of the
wavelength of the disturbances and are explained physically. Comparison of the
results with nonlinear analytical or numerical calculations is also presented,
excellent agreement is found, and confidence in the analytical, linear approach
is gained to explore phenomena difficult to study through numerical
simulations. Mode splitting and mode merging, which are impossible in
single-fluid systems for linear perturbations, occur naturally in multifluid
systems.

do not measure the position of the comet within each image, but rather use the

hole of mass M and spin J. For a given dimensionless spin a=J/M^2 (in
geometrical units), the energy flux depends only on the orbital velocity v or
(equivalently) on the Boyer-Lindquist orbital radius r. We investigate the
formal region of validity of the Taylor post-Newtonian expansion of the energy
flux (which is known up to order v^8 beyond the quadrupole formula),
generalizing previous work by two of us. The ""error function"" used to determine
the region of validity of the post-Newtonian expansion can have two
qualitatively different kinds of behavior, and we deal with these two cases
separately. We find that, at any fixed post-Newtonian order, the edge of the
region of validity (as measured by v/v_{ISCO}, where v_{ISCO} is the orbital
velocity at the innermost stable circular orbit) is only weakly dependent on a.
Unlike in the nonspinning case, the lack of sufficiently high order terms does
not allow us to determine if there is a convergent to divergent transition at
order v^6. Independently of a, the inclusion of angular multipoles up to and
including l=5 in the numerical flux is necessary to achieve the level of

Spitzer heat conduction along the magnetic field and optically thin radiative
losses. The self-consistent heating mechanism is based on the braiding of

induced by photospheric motions leads to currents in the atmosphere which heat
the corona through Ohmic dissipation. While the horizontally averaged
quantities, such as heating rate, temperature or density, are relatively
constant in time, the simulated corona is highly variable and dynamic, on
average reaching temperatures and densities as found in observations. The
strongest heating per particle is found in the transition region from the
chromosphere to the corona. The heating is concentrated in current sheets
roughly aligned with the magnetic field and is transient in time and space.
This supports the idea that numerous small heating events heat the corona,

many more low-$p_t$ particles for central Au-Au.

Nanowires having cross-sectional dimensions large enough to support vortex wall

numerical simulations of the spin distribution and dynamics within the

The Harrington-Shepard caloron solution is used to modify the instanton

(R), as functions of T. In addition, we include the meson-loop corrections
(MLC) as the large-N_c corrections because they are critical for reproducing
the universal chiral restoration pattern. We present the numerical results for
the constituent-quark mass as well as chiral condensate which signal the
spontaneous breakdown of chiral-symmetry SBCS, as functions of T and B_0. From
our results we observe that the strengths of those chiral order parameters are
enhanced with respect to B_0 due to the magnetic catalysis effect. We also find
that there appears a region where the u and d-quark constituent masses coincide
with each other at eB_0 = (7 ~ 9) m^2_pi, even in the presence of the explicit
isospin breaking. The critical T for the chiral restoration T_c tends to shift
to the higher temperature in the presence of the B_0 for the chiral limit but
keeps almost stationary for the physical quark mass case. We also compute the
pion weak-decay constant F_pi and pion mass m_pi below T_c, varying the
strength of the magnetic field, showing correct partial chiral restoration
behaviors. Besides we find that the changes for the F_pi and m_pi due to the

yield non-local exchange-correlation potentials, free energies etc., valid
within the timescales of each evolving system. An accurate classical map of the
strongly-quantum uniform electron-gas problem given by Dharma-wardana and

energy. It has been shown, but not proven, that the classical fluid g_ij are
excellent approximations to the quantum g_ij. The classical map is used with
classical molecular dynamics (CMMD) or hyper-netted-chain integral equations

tested by the precision data. It is found that the forward-backward asymmetries

the warp factor $z_L$, but the model is consistent with the branching fractions
of $Z$ decay only for large $z_L \simg 10^{15}$. Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectra of
gauge bosons, quarks, and leptons as well as gauge and Higgs couplings of
low-lying KK excited states are determined. Right-handed quarks and leptons
have larger couplings to the KK gauge bosons than left-handed ones. Production
rates of Higgs bosons and KK states at Tevatron, LHC and ILC are evaluated. The
first KK $Z$ has a mass 1130 GeV with a width 422 GeV for $z_L = 10^{15}$. The
current limit on the $Z'$ production at Tevatron and LHC indicates $z_L

the rapidity distributions of $e^+$ and $e^-$ in the decay of the first KK $Z$.
The first KK gauge bosons decay into light and heavy quarks evenly.

in a PBR. A new mechanical motion simulator, PEBBLES, efficiently simulates the
key elements of motion of the pebbles in a PBR. This model simulates
gravitational force and contact forces including kinetic and true static
friction. It's used for a variety of tasks including simulation of the effect
of earthquakes on a PBR, calculation of packing fractions, Dancoff factors,
pebble wear and the pebble force on the walls. The simulator includes a new
differential static friction model for the varied geometries of PBRs. A new
static friction benchmark was devised via analytically solving the mechanics
equations to determine the minimum pebble-to-pebble friction and
pebble-to-surface friction for a five pebble pyramid. This pyramid check as
well as a comparison to the Janssen formula was used to test the new static
friction equations.
  Because larger pebble bed simulations involve hundreds of thousands of
pebbles and long periods of time, PEBBLES runs on shared memory architectures
and distributed memory architectures. For the shared memory architecture, the
code uses a new O(n) lock-less parallel collision detection algorithm to
determine which pebbles are likely to be in contact.
  The PEBBLES code provides new capabilities for understanding and optimizing
PBRs. The PEBBLES code has provided the pebble motion data required to
calculate the motion of pebbles during a simulated earthquake. The PEBBLES code
provides the ability to determine the contact forces and the lengths of motion
in contact. This information combined with the proper wear coefficients can be
used to determine the dust production from mechanical wear. These new
capabilities enhance the understanding of PBRs, and the capabilities of the
code will allow future improvements in understanding.

Waiting-time distributions are also constructed. These and other statistics
support the hypothesis that catastrophic unpinning mediated by collective
vortex motion produces glitches; indeed, such collective events are seen in
time-lapse movies of superfluid density. Three principal trends are observed.
(1) The glitch rate scales proportional to the electromagnetic spin-down

$k$ with $2\leq k\leq n$, the $k$-connectivity $\kappa_k(G)$ of $G$ is the
greatest positive integer $r$ for which $G$ contains at least $r$ internally
disjoint trees connecting $S$ for any set $S$ of $k$ vertices of $G$.
Obviously, $\kappa_2(G)=\kappa(G)$ is the connectivity of $G$. Sabidussi showed
that $\kappa(G\Box H) \geq \kappa(G)+\kappa(H)$ for any two connected graphs
$G$ and $H$. In this paper, we first study the 3-connectivity of the Cartesian
product of a graph $G$ and a tree $T$, and show that $(i)$ if
$\kappa_3(G)=\kappa(G)\geq 1$, then $\kappa_3(G\Box T)\geq \kappa_3(G)$; $(ii)$
if $1\leq \kappa_3(G)< \kappa(G)$, then $\kappa_3(G\Box T)\geq \kappa_3(G)+1$.
Furthermore, for any two connected graphs $G$ and $H$ with
$\kappa_3(G)\geq\kappa_3(H)$, if $\kappa(G)>\kappa_3(G)$, then $\kappa_3(G\Box
H)\geq \kappa_3(G)+\kappa_3(H)$; if $\kappa(G)=\kappa_3(G)$, then
$\kappa_3(G\Box H)\geq \kappa_3(G)+\kappa_3(H)-1$. Our result could be seen as
a generalization of Sabidussi's result. Moreover, all the bounds are sharp.

statistics, the chemical similarity between the Galactic bulge and thick disk,
which are both enhanced in alpha elements when compared to the thin disk. In
the same context, we analyze [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends across different
bulge regions. The most metal rich stars, showing low [alpha/Fe] ratios at b=-4
disappear at higher Galactic latitudes in agreement with the observed
metallicity gradient in the bulge. Metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-0.2) show a
remarkable homogeneity at different bulge locations. We have obtained further
constrains for the formation scenario of the Galactic bulge. A metal-poor
component chemically indistinguishable from the thick disk hints for a fast and
early formation for both the bulge and the thick disk. Such a component shows
no variation, neither in abundances nor kinematics, among different bulge
regions. A metal-rich component showing low [alpha/Fe] similar to those of the
thin disk disappears at larger latitudes. This allows us to trace a component

a multiprocessor. The relative merits of strict versus relaxed memory models
have been widely debated in terms of their impact on performance, hardware
complexity and programmability. This paper adds a new dimension to this
discussion: the impact of memory models on software reliability. By allowing
some instructions to reorder, weak memory models may expand the window between
critical memory operations. This can increase the chance of an undesirable
thread-interleaving, thus allowing an otherwise-unlikely concurrency bug to
manifest. To explore this phenomenon, we define and study a probabilistic model
of shared-memory parallel programs that takes into account such reordering. We
use this model to formally derive bounds on the \emph{vulnerability} to
concurrency bugs of different memory models. Our results show that for 2 (or a
small constant number of) concurrent threads, weaker memory models do indeed
have a higher likelihood of allowing bugs. On the other hand, we show that as
the number of parallel threads increases, the gap between the different memory
models becomes proportionally insignificant. This suggests the
counter-intuitive rule that \emph{as the number of parallel threads in the
system increases, the importance of using a strict memory model diminishes};
which potentially has major implications on the choice of memory consistency
models in future multi-core systems.

formation, but the fraction of gas with ongoing star formation decreases as the

is at least a factor of ~ 2 smaller than typical of star forming regions in

increases with increasing gas column density. This is unlikely to be due to
increasing dust extinction because the required dust to gas ratios are too
high. We suggest instead that this correlation arises because massive (i.e.

reduction in high-dimensional regression problems. The original method,
however, requires the inversion of the predictors covariance matrix. In case of
collinearity between these predictors or small sample sizes compared to the
dimension, the inversion is not possible and a regularization technique has to
be used. Our approach is based on a Fisher Lecture given by R.D. Cook where it
is shown that SIR axes can be interpreted as solutions of an inverse regression
problem. In this paper, a Gaussian prior distribution is introduced on the
unknown parameters of the inverse regression problem in order to regularize
their estimation. We show that some existing SIR regularizations can enter our
framework, which permits a global understanding of these methods. Three new
priors are proposed leading to new regularizations of the SIR method. A
comparison on simulated data is provided.

a magnet as a result of a temperature gradient. Spin voltage stands for the
potential for spins, which drives a spin current. The SSE is of crucial
importance in spintronics and energy-conversion technology, since it enables
simple and versatile generation of spin currents from heat. The SSE has been
observed in a variety of materials ranging from magnetic metals and
semiconductors to magnetic insulators. However, the mechanism, the long-range
nature, of the SSE in metals is still to be clarified. Here we found that,
using a Ni81Fe19/Pt bilayer wire on an insulating sapphire plate, the
long-range spin voltage induced by the SSE in magnetic metals is due to
phonons. Under a temperature gradient in the sapphire, surprisingly, the
voltage generated in the Pt layer is shown to reflect the wire position,
although the wire is isolated both electrically and magnetically. This
non-local voltage is direct evidence that the SSE is attributed to the coupling
of spins and phonons. We demonstrate this coupling by directly injecting sound
waves, which realizes the acoustic spin pumping. Our finding opens the door to
""acoustic spintronics"" in which phonons are exploited for constructing
spin-based devices.

self-gravitating systems are neither maximum nor minimum, but complex
saddle-point entropy states, and hence differ greatly from the case of ideal
gas. Violent relaxation should be divided into two phases. The first phase is
the entropy-production phase, while the second phase is the entropy-decreasing
phase. We speculate that the second-phase violent relaxation may just be the
long-wave Landau damping, which would work together with short-range
relaxations to keep the system equilibrated around the saddle-point entropy

effective interfacial Hamiltonian approach in the framework of the well known
sharp-kink approximation (SKA). We obtain very good agreement with a mean-field
density functional theory (DFT), fully justifying the use of SKA in this limit.
We then turn our attention to substrates of finite curvature and appropriately
modify the so-called soft-interface approximation (SIA) originally formulated
by Napi\'orkowski and Dietrich [Phys. Rev. B 34, 6469 (1986)] for critical
wetting on a planar wall. A detailed asymptotic analysis of SIA confirms the
SKA functional form for the film growth. However, it turns out that the
agreement between SKA and our DFT is only qualitative. We then show that the
quantitative discrepancy between the two is due to the overestimation of the
liquid-gas surface tension within SKA. On the other hand, by relaxing the
assumption of a sharp interface, with, e.g., a simple smoothing of the density
profile there, markedly improves the predictive capability of the theory,
making it quantitative and showing that the liquid-gas surface tension plays a
crucial role when describing wetting on a curved substrate. In addition, we
show that in contrast to SKA, SIA predicts the expected mean-field critical
exponent of the liquid-gas surface tension.

interesting that the root mean square of the mass number is not very different

The quantum description predicts sinusoidal interference for specific outcomes
of the experiment, and these predictions can be verified in experiment. In the
spirit of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen it is possible to ask if the
quantum-mechanical description (of this setup) can be considered complete. This
question will be answered in detail in this paper, by delineating the quite
complicated relation between energy-time entanglement experiments and
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) elements of reality. The mentioned sinusoidal
interference pattern is the same as that giving a violation in the usual Bell
experiment. Even so, depending on the precise requirements made on the local
realist model, this can imply a) no violation, b) smaller violation than usual,
or c) full violation of the appropriate statistical bound. Alternatives include
a) using only the measurement outcomes as EPR elements of reality, b) using the
emission time as EPR element of reality, c) using path realism, or d) using a
modified setup. This paper discusses the nature of these alternatives and how
to choose between them. The subtleties of this discussion needs to be taken
into account when designing and setting up experiments intended to test local
realism. Furthermore, these considerations are also important for quantum

of matter $\Omega_{m,0}$, the growth rate $f$ in Galileon models is enhanced,
relative to the $\Lambda$CDM case, because of an increase in Newton's constant.
The smaller $\Omega_{m,0}$ is, the more growth rate is suppressed. Therefore,
the best fit value of $\Omega_{m,0}$ in the Galileon model, based only the
growth rate data, is quite small. This is incompatible with the value of
$\Omega_{m,0}$ obtained from the combination of SN Ia, CMB, and BAO data. On
the other hand, in the $\Lambda$CDM model, the values of $\Omega_{m,0}$
obtained from different observational data sets are consistent. In the analysis

gauge-invariant formalism for linear perturbations in a fairly generic class of

geometry. We classify perturbations of such a background into three types, the
tensor, vector and scalar-type, according to their tensorial behaviour on the
n-dimensional part of the background spacetime, and for each type of
perturbations, we introduce a set of manifestly gauge invariant variables. We
then introduce harmonic tensors and write down the equations of motion for the
expansion coefficients of the gauge invariant perturbation variables in terms
of the harmonics. In particular, for the tensor-type perturbations a single
master equation is obtained in the (m+n)-dimensional background, which is
applicable for perturbation analysis of not only static black holes but also
some class of rotating black holes as well as black-branes. For the vector and
scalar type, we derive a set of decoupled master equations when the background
is a (2+n)-dimensional static black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell theory with a
cosmological constant. As an application of the master equations, we review the
stability analysis of higher dimensional charged static black holes with a
cosmological constant. We also briefly review the recent results of a
generalisation of the perturbation formulae presented here and stability
analysis to static black holes in generic Lovelock theory.

with increasing $n$, and depends crucially on the polarization direction of the
incident light, and the type of the edge alignment. This provides an efficient
way of determining the nature of the edge alignment, and $n$, in the
experiments. In the presence of a gate bias, the intensity of optical
absorption behaves in a nontrivial way. The absorption becomes more intense for
the large fields in narrow ribbons exhibiting a red shift of the band gap with
the increasing field strength, while in broad ribbons exhibiting a blue shift,
the absorption becomes weaker. However, for smaller electric fields, the
absorption intensity exhibits more complicated behavior with respect to the
field strength. Thus, the effect of the gate bias on optical absorption
intensity in multilayer AGNRs is in sharp contrast to the bilayer graphene,
which exhibits only enhancement of the absorption intensity with the increasing
electric field.

Furthermore, we identify a threshold of the off-diagonal coupling strength

2007, which solves the inverse boundary value problem of the Schr\""odinger
equation in the plane. The thesis is mainly based on Bukhgeim's paper and Kari
Astala's seminar talk, which he gave the 11th and 18th September of 2008 at the
University of Helsinki.
  Section 3 is devoted to the history and past results concerning some related
problems: notably the inverse problem of the Schr\""odinger and conductivity
equations in different settings. We also describe why some of the past methods
do not work in the general case in a plane domain.
  Section 4 outlines Bukhgeim's result and sketches out the proof. This proof
is a streamlined version of the one in Bukhgeim's paper with the stationary
phase method based on Kari Astala's presentation. In the following section we
prove all the needed lemmas which are combined in section 6 to prove the
solvability of the inverse problem.
  The idea of the proof is simple. Given two Schr\""odinger equations with the
same boundary data we get an orthogonality relation for the solutions of the
two equations. Then we show the existence of certain oscillating solutions and
insert these into the orthogonality relation. Then by a stationary phase
argument we see that the two Schr\""odinger equations are the same.
  In the last section we contemplate an unclear detail in Bukhgeim's paper
which Kari Astala pointed out in his seminar talk: without an extra argument
Bukhgeim's proof shows the solvability of the inverse problem only for
differentiable potentials instead of ones in L^p. But the special oscillating
solutions exist even for L^p potentials.

dependent interactions in condensed matter. Following some of the ideas
presented therein, and applied to a Hamiltonian containing a Rashba-like
interaction, a general variational Monte Carlo approach is here introduced that
treats in an efficient and very accurate way the spin degrees of freedom in
atoms when spin orbit effects are included in the Hamiltonian describing the
electronic structure. We illustrate the algorithm on the evaluation of the
spin-orbit splittings of isolated carbon and lead atoms. In the case of the
carbon atom, we investigate the differences between the inclusion of spin-orbit
in its realistic and effective spherically symmetrized forms. The method
exhibits a very good accuracy in describing the small energy splittings,
opening the way for a systematic quantum Monte Carlo studies of spin-orbit
effects in atomic systems.

This leads to an inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system coupled to a Cahn-Hilliard

responsible for the light neutrino mass generation, lie at the electroweak
scale. Under certain conditions, the strength of the charged and neutral
current weak interactions of the Standard Model particles with the heavy RH
neutrinos can be large enough to allow their production at the LHC, opening
also the possibility of observing other low energy signatures of the new
physics in the electroweak precision observables as well as in searches for
rare leptonic decays or neutrinoless double beta decay. We argue that in this
scenario the flavour structure of the neutrino Yukawa couplings is essentially
determined by the low energy neutrino parameters, leading to fairly strong
correlations among the new phenomena. In particular, we show that the present
bound on the $\mu \to e +\gamma$ decay rate makes very difficult the
observation of the heavy RH neutrinos at the LHC or the observation of
deviations from the Standard Model predictions in the electroweak precision
data. We also argue that all present experimental constraints on this scenario
still allow i) for an enhancement of the rate of neutrinoless double beta
decay, which thus can be in the range of sensitivity of the GERDA experiment
even when the light Majorana neutrinos possess a normal hierarchical mass
spectrum, and ii) for the predicted $\mu \to e+ \gamma$ decay rate to be within
the sensitivity range of the MEG experiment.
