provided by a family of scanning instruments like the Herschel observatory. To
do this, we constructed a model of the instrument that faithfully reflects the
physical reality, accurately taking the acquisition process into account to
explain the data in a reliable manner. The inversion, ie the image
reconstruction process, is based on a linear approach resulting from a
quadratic regularized criterion and numerical optimization tools. The
application concerns the reconstruction of maps for the SPIRE instrument of the
Herschel observatory. The numerical evaluation uses simulated and real data to
compare the standard tool (coaddition) and the proposed method. The inversion
approach is capable to restore spatial frequencies over a bandwidth four times
that possible with coaddition and thus to correctly show details invisible on
standard maps. The approach is also applied to real data with significant
improvement in spatial resolution.

single-component fermionic polar molecules dressed by a circularly polarized
microwave field. This phase emerges because the molecules may interact with
each other via a potential V_0(r) that has an attractive dipole-dipole 1/r^3
tail, which provides p-wave superfluid pairing at fairly high temperatures. We
calculate the amplitude of elastic p-wave scattering in the potential V_0(r)
taking into account both the anomalous scattering due to the dipole-dipole tail
and the short-range contribution. This amplitude is then used for the
analytical and numerical solution of the renormalized BCS gap equation which
includes the second order Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections and the
correction related to the effective mass of the quasiparticles. We find that
the critical temperature T_c can be varied within a few orders of magnitude by
modifying the short-range part of the potential V_0(r). The decay of the system
via collisional relaxation of molecules to dressed states with lower energies
is rather slow due to the necessity of a large momentum transfer. The presence
of a constant transverse electric field reduces the inelastic rate, and the
lifetime of the system can be of the order of seconds even at 2D densities ~
10^9 cm^{-2}. This leads to T_c of up to a few tens of nanokelvins and makes it
realistic to obtain the topological p_x+ip_y phase in experiments with
ultracold polar molecules.

These applications use two significantly different DB structures:
multidimensional (MD) and table-based. One can show that the traditional model
of relational databases cannot make difference between these two structures.
Another model is necessary to make the differences visible. One of these is the
speed of the system. It can be proven that the multidimensional DB organization
results in shorter response times. And it is crucial, since a manager may
become impatient, if he or she has to wait say more than 20 seconds for the
next screen. On the other hand, we have to pay for the speed with a bigger DB
size. Why does the size of MD databases grow so quickly? The reason is the
sparsity of data: The MD matrix contains many empty cells. Efficient handling
of sparse matrices is indispensable in an OLAP application. One way to handle
sparsity is to take the structure closer to the table-based one. Thus the DB
size decreases, while the application gets slower. Therefore, other methods are
needed. This paper deals with the comparison of the two DB structures and the
limits of their usage. The new results of the paper: (1) It gives a
constructive proof that all relations can be represented in MD arrays. (2) It
also shows when the MD array representation is quicker than the table-based
one. (3) The MD representation results in smaller DB size under some
conditions. One such sufficient condition is proved in the paper. (4) A
variation of the single count header compression scheme is described with an
algorithm, which creates the compressed array from the ordered table without
materializing the uncompressed array. (5) The speed of the two different
database organizations is tested with experiments, as well. The tests are done
on benchmark as well as real life data. The experiments support the theoretical
results.

every element is the sum of a unit (resp. regular element) and a projection.
Although *-clean is a stronger notion than clean, for some *-rings we
demonstrate that it is more natural to use.
  The theorem on cleanness of unit-regular rings from [V. P. Camillo, D.

axioms, the following properties are equivalent: regular, unit-regular, left

These pinning domains model small impurities in a homogeneous superconductor

gradually slowing down to lower frequencies, which increases the tremendous
compression of the matter inside of them. This increase in compression changes
both the global properties of rotating neutron stars as well as their hadronic
core compositions. Both effects may register themselves observationally in the
thermal evolution of such stars, as demonstrated in this Letter. The
rotation-driven particle process which we consider here is the direct Urca (DU)
process, which is known to become operative in neutron stars if the number of
protons in the stellar core exceeds a critical limit of around 11% to 15%. We
find that neutron stars spinning down from moderately high rotation rates of a
few hundred Hertz may be creating just the right conditions where the DU
process becomes operative, leading to an observable effect (enhanced cooling)
in the temperature evolution of such neutron stars. As it turns out, the
rotation-driven DU process could explain the unusual temperature evolution
observed for the neutron star in Cas A, provided the mass of this neutron star

space telescopes AGILE and Fermi. The gamma-ray emission is transient,
modulated with the orbital period and seems related to major radio flares, i.e.
to the relativistic jet. The GeV gamma-ray flux can be substantially attenuated
by internal absorption with the ambient X-rays. In this study, we examine
quantitatively the effect of pair production in Cygnus X-3 and put constraints
on the location of the gamma-ray source. Cygnus X-3 exhibits complex temporal
and spectral patterns in X-rays. During gamma-ray flares, the X-ray emission
can be approximated by a bright disk black body component and a non-thermal
tail extending in hard X-rays, possibly related to a corona above the disk. We
calculate numerically the exact optical depth for gamma rays above a standard
accretion disk. Emission and absorption in the corona are also investigated.
GeV gamma rays are significantly absorbed by soft X-rays emitted from the inner
parts of the accretion disk. The absorption pattern is complex and anisotropic.
Isotropization of X-rays due to Thomson scattering in the companion star wind
tends to increase the gamma-ray opacity. Gamma rays from the corona suffer from
strong absorption by photons from the disk and cannot explain the observed
high-energy emission, unless the corona is unrealistically extended. The lack
of absorption feature in the GeV emission indicates that high-energy gamma rays

function, and distribution of noise among channels of the spectrum unchanged.
Pulsars are examples of such sources: intermittent and affected by interstellar
propagation. We assume that the source emits Gaussian white noise, modulated by
a time-envelope. Propagation convolves the resulting time series with an
impulse-response function that represents effects of dispersion, scattering,
and absorption. We assume that this propagation kernel is shorter than the time
for an observer to accumulate a single spectrum. We show that rapidly-varying
intermittent emission tends to concentrate noise near the central lag of the

terms of the time envelope and the propagation kernel. We present examples,
discuss effects of background noise, and compare our results with observations.

amplitude variations of the pulsar strongly affect the amount and distribution
of self-noise. We show that noise follows a quadratic polynomial with flux
density, in spectral observations. Constant coefficients, indicative of
background noise, agree well with expectation; whereas second-order
coefficients, indicative of self-noise, are about 3 times values expected for a
pulsar with constant on-pulse flux density. We show that variations in flux
density during the 10-sec integration account for the discrepancy. In the
secondary spectrum, about 97% of spectral power lies within the pulsar's
typical scintillation bandwidth and timescale; an extended scintillation arc
contains about 3%. For a pulsar with constant on-pulse flux density, noise in
the dynamic spectrum will appear as a uniformly-distributed background in the
secondary spectrum. We find that this uniform noise background contains 95% of
noise in the dynamic spectrum for interferometric observations; but only 35% of
noise in the dynamic spectrum for single-dish observations. Receiver and sky
dominate noise for our interferometric observations, whereas self-noise
dominates for single-dish. We suggest that intermittent emission by the pulsar,
on timescales < 300 microseconds, concentrates self-noise near the origin in
the secondary spectrum, by correlating noise over the dynamic spectrum. We
suggest that intermittency sets fundamental limits on pulsar astrometry or
timing. Accounting of noise may provide means for detection of intermittent

users feedback their channel state information (CSI) to help the base station
(BS) schedule users and improve the system sum rate. However, this incurs a
large aggregate feedback bandwidth which grows linearly with the number of
users. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to reduce the feedback load in
a downlink orthogonal space division multiple access (SDMA) system with
zero-forcing receivers by allowing the users to dynamically determine the
number of feedback bits to use according to multiple decision thresholds.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that, while keeping the aggregate
feedback load of the entire system constant regardless of the number of users,
the proposed scheme almost achieves the optimal asymptotic sum rate scaling
with respect to the number of users (also known as the multiuser diversity).
Specifically, given the number of thresholds, the proposed scheme can achieve a
constant portion of the optimal sum rate achievable only by the system where
all the users always feedback, and the remaining portion (referred to as the
sum rate loss) decreases exponentially to zero as the number of thresholds
increases. By deriving a tight upper bound for the sum rate loss, the minimum
number of thresholds for a given tolerable sum rate loss is determined. In
addition, a fast bit allocation method is discussed for the proposed scheme,
and the simulation results show that the sum rate performances with the complex
optimal bit allocation method and with the fast algorithm are almost the same.
We compare our multi-threshold scheme to some previously proposed feedback
schemes. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce
the feedback load and utilize the limited feedback bandwidth more effectively
than the existing feedback methods.

planets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170
systems with 408 candidates. When compared to the 827 systems with only one
candidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,
and a third of all the planet candidates. We compare the characteristics of
candidates found in multiples with those found in singles. False positives due
to eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.
Singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than Neptune; 69
+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. This result, that
systems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include a
transiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disrupt
the orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even to
prevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

CO emission from >100 galaxies, covering a range of galaxy populations at z>1,
reaching out to z>6, down to sub-kpc scale resolution, and spanning ~2 orders
of magnitude in gas mass (aided by gravitational lensing). Recently, it has
even become possible to directly identify distant galaxies through their
molecular emission lines without prior knowledge of their redshifts. The new
generation of powerful long wavelength interferometers such as the Expanded
Very Large Array (EVLA) and Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA) thus
hold the promise to liberate studies of molecular gas in high redshift galaxies

accretion of kilometre-sized planetesimals. To this effect we numerically
estimate the impact velocities $dv$ amongst a population of circumprimary

to planetesimal accretion, especially the region around 2.6AU (the planet's
location) where binary perturbations induce planetesimal-shattering $dv$ of
more than 1km/s. Possible solutions to the paradox of having a planet in such
accretion-hostile regions are 1) that initial planetesimals were very big, at
least 250km, 2) that the binary had an initial orbit at least twice the present
one, and was later compacted due to early stellar encounters, 3) that
planetesimals did not grow by mutual impacts but by sweeping of dust (the

holographic information on multiquark correlations. Two prominent examples are
studied by implementing this robust and universal mechanism into AdS/QCD
gravity duals. In the baryon sector bulk-mass corrections are used to describe
systematic good (i.e. maximally attractive) diquark effects. The baryon sizes
are predicted to decrease with increasing good-diquark content, and the masses
of all 48 observed light-quark baryon states are reproduced with unprecedented
accuracy. Our approach further provides the first holographic description of a
dominant tetraquark component in the lowest-lying scalar mesons. The tetraquark
ground state emerges naturally as the lightest scalar nonet whereas higher
excitations become heavier than their quark--antiquark counterparts and are
thus likely to dissolve into the multiparticle continuum.

the latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formation

that they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heating

convex curved edge (polygons are special splinegons). Each curved edge is
assumed to be of O(1) complexity. Given in the plane two points s and t and a
set of $h$ pairwise disjoint splinegons with a total of $n$ vertices, we
compute a shortest s-to-t path avoiding the splinegons, in
$O(n+h\log^{1+\epsilon}h+k)$ time, where k is a parameter sensitive to the
structures of the input splinegons and is upper-bounded by $O(h^2)$. In
particular, when all splinegons are convex, $k$ is proportional to the number
of common tangents in the free space (called ""free common tangents"") among the
splinegons. We develop techniques for solving the problem on the general

particular, our techniques produce an optimal output-sensitive algorithm for a
basic visibility problem of computing all free common tangents among $h$

energy of the charge carriers? Conventional BCS theory predicts that the
kinetic energy of carriers increases in the transition from the normal to the
superconducting state. However, substantial experimental evidence obtained in
recent years indicates that in at least some superconductors the opposite
occurs. Motivated in part by these experiments many novel mechanisms of
superconductivity have recently been proposed where the transition to
superconductivity is associated with a lowering of the kinetic energy of the
carriers. However none of these proposed unconventional mechanisms explores the
fundamental reason for kinetic energy lowering nor its wider implications. Here
I propose that kinetic energy lowering is at the root of the Meissner effect,
the most fundamental property of superconductors. The physics can be understood
at the level of a single electron atom: kinetic energy lowering and enhanced
diamagnetic susceptibility are intimately connected. According to the theory of
hole superconductivity, superconductors expel negative charge from their
interior driven by kinetic energy lowering and in the process expel any
magnetic field lines present in their interior. Associated with this we predict
the existence of a macroscopic electric field in the interior of
superconductors and the existence of macroscopic quantum zero-point motion in
the form of a spin current in the ground state of superconductors (spin
Meissner effect). In turn, the understanding of the role of kinetic energy
lowering in superconductivity suggests a new way to understand the fundamental
origin of kinetic energy lowering in quantum mechanics quite generally.

[Phys.Rev.A 64, 013605(2001)]. Recently the adiabatic dynamics of the
double-well BEC is investigated under the MFT in terms of a dark variable
[Phys.Rev.A 81, 043621(2010)], which generalizes the adiabatic passage
techniques in quantum optics to the nonlinear matter-wave case. We give a fully
quan- tized version of it using second-quantization and introduce new
correction terms from higher order interactions beyond the on-site interaction,
which are interactions between the tunneling particle and the particle in the
well and interactions between the tunneling particles. If only the on-site
interaction is considered, this reduces to the usual two-mode BEC.

roughly independent of ambient field; the faster, T_1f, decreases with
increasing ambient field. A model in which nuclear spin relaxation occurs at

subsets of popular nonstationary time series such as locally stationary,
cyclostationary and uniformly modulated processes. The class also contains
aggregations of the aforementioned processes. Ambiguity sparse processes are
defined for a fixed sampling regime, in terms of a given number of sample
points and a fixed sampling period. The framework naturally allows us to treat
heterogeneously nonstationary processes, and to develop methodology for
processes that have growing but controlled complexity with increasing sample
sizes and shrinking sampling periods. Expressions for the moments of the sample
ambiguity function are derived for ambiguity sparse processes. These properties
inspire an Empirical Bayes shrinkage estimation procedure. The representation
of the covariance structure of the process in terms of a time-frequency
representation is separated from the estimation of these second order
properties. The estimated ambiguity function is converted into an estimate of
the time-varying moments of the process, and from these moments, any bilinear
representation can be calculated with reduced estimation risk. Any of these
representations can be used to understand the time-varying spectral content of
the signal. The choice of representation is discussed. Parameters of the
shrinkage procedure quantify the performance of the proposed estimation.

product state of $\alpha$'s, all with their c.o.m. in the lowest 0S orbit. We
demonstrate that a typical $\alpha$-particle condensate is the Hoyle state
($E_{x}=7.65$ MeV, $0^+_2$ state in $^{12}$C), which plays a crucial role for
the synthesis of $^{12}$C in the universe. The influence of antisymmentrization
in the Hoyle state on the bosonic character of the $\alpha$ particle is
discussed in detail. It is shown to be weak. The bosonic aspects in the Hoyle
state, therefore, are predominant. It is conjectured that $\alpha$-particle
condensate states also exist in heavier $n\alpha$ nuclei, like $^{16}$O,
$^{20}$Ne, etc. For instance the $0^+_6$ state of $^{16}$O at $E_{x}=15.1$ MeV
is identified from a theoretical analysis as being a strong candidate of a
$4\alpha$ condensate. The calculated small width (34 keV) of $0^+_6$,
consistent with data, lends credit to the existence of heavier Hoyle-analogue
states. In non-self-conjugated nuclei such as $^{11}$B and $^{13}$C, we discuss
candidates for the product states of clusters, composed of $\alpha$'s,
triton's, and neutrons etc. The relationship of $\alpha$-particle condensation
in finite nuclei to quartetting in symmetric nuclear matter is investigated
with the help of an in-medium modified four-nucleon equation. A nonlinear order
parameter equation for quartet condensation is derived and solved for $\alpha$
particle condensation in infinite nuclear matter. The strong qualitative
difference with the pairing case is pointed out.

radio galaxy cores. From these samples, we first examine the correlation
between the luminosities at 5 GHz, L_{5GHz}, and at 0.1-10 GeV, L_{gamma}, of
these gamma-ray loud radio galaxies. We find that the correlation is
significant with L_{gamma} \propto L_{5GHz}^{1.16} based on a partial
correlation analysis. Using this correlation and the radio luminosity function
(RLF) of radio galaxies, we further explore the contribution of gamma-ray loud
radio galaxies to the unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB). The
gamma-ray luminosity function is obtained by normalizing the RLF to reproduce
the source count distribution of the Fermi gamma-ray loud radio galaxies. We
find that gamma-ray loud radio galaxies will explain ~25% of the unresolved
Fermi EGRB flux above 100 MeV and will also make a significant contribution to
the EGRB in the 1-30 MeV energy band. Since blazars explain 22% of the EGRB
above 100 MeV, radio loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) population explains
~47% of the unresolved EGRB. We further make an interpretation on the origin of
the EGRB. The observed EGRB spectrum at 0.2-100 GeV does not show an absorption
signature by the extragalactic background light. Thus, the dominant population
of the origin of EGRB at very high energy (>30 GeV) might be nearby gamma-ray
emitting sources or sources with very hard gamma-ray spectrum.

hundred micro-arcseconds per year for certain objects. When imaged with VLBI at

to the problem of sampling from a target distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
large $d$. It is well known that using a single importance sampling step one
produces an approximation for the target that deteriorates as the dimension $d$
increases, unless the number of Monte Carlo samples $N$ increases at an
exponential rate in $d$. We show that this degeneracy can be avoided by
introducing a sequence of artificial targets, starting from a `simple' density
and moving to the one of interest, using an SMC method to sample from the
sequence. Using this class of SMC methods with a fixed number of samples, one
can produce an approximation for which the effective sample size (ESS)
converges to a random variable $\varepsilon_N$ as $d\rightarrow\infty$ with
$1<\varepsilon_{N}<N$. The convergence is achieved with a computational cost
proportional to $Nd^2$. If $\varepsilon_N\ll N$, we can raise its value by
introducing a number of resampling steps, say $m$ (where $m$ is independent of
$d$). In this case, ESS converges to a random variable $\varepsilon_{N,m}$ as
$d\rightarrow\infty$ and $\lim_{m\to\infty}\varepsilon_{N,m}=N$. Also, we show
that the Monte Carlo error for estimating a fixed dimensional marginal
expectation is of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ uniformly in $d$. The results
imply that, in high dimensions, SMC algorithms can efficiently control the
variability of the importance sampling weights and estimate fixed dimensional
marginals at a cost which is less than exponential in $d$ and indicate that, in
high dimensions, resampling leads to a reduction in the Monte Carlo error and
increase in the ESS.

incident electromagnetic waves. A clear identification of momentum density and
momentum flow, including their electromagnetic and mechanical parts, is
obtained by employing this formalism in a lossless dispersive metamaterial
(including the cases of impedance matching and mismatching with vacuum). It is
found that the ratio of the electromagnetic momentum density to the mechanical
momentum density depends on the impedance and group velocity of the
electromagnetic wave inside the metamaterial. One of the definite results is
that both the electromagnetic momentum and the mechanical momentum in the
metamaterial are in the same direction as the energy flow, instead of in the
direction of the wave vector. The conservation of total momentum is verified.
In addition, the law of energy conservation in the process of normal incidence
is also verified by using the wave-packet integral of both the electromagnetic

In this paper, we re-analyze the subsample and found that a significantly
tighter correlation exists when we add a third parameter, i.e. the isotropic
$\gamma$-ray energy release, into the consideration. Additionally, both long
and intermediate duration GRBs are consistent with the same three-parameter
correlation equation. It is argued that the new three-parameter correlation is
consistent with the hypothesis that the subsample of GRBs with a plateau phase
in the afterglow be associated with the birth of rapidly rotating magnetars,
and that the plateau be due to the continuous energy-injection from the
magnetar. It is suggested that the newly born millisecond magnetars associated
with GRBs might provide a good standard candle in the Universe.

islands rotational tori, while the chaotic zone connecting the points of the
unstable periodic orbit is replaced by filaments extending in 4D following a
smooth color variation. For more intersections, the consequents of the orbit
which started in the neighborhood of the unstable periodic orbit, diffuse in
phase space and form a cloud that occupies a large volume surrounding the

evolution of strongly interacting matter created in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions.
The model is applied for the domain of bombarding energies 1-160 AGeV which
includes future NICA and FAIR experiments. Two equations of state are used: the
first one corresponding to resonance hadron gas and the second one including
the deconfinement phase transition. The initial state is represented by two
Lorentz-boosted nuclei. Dynamical trajectories of matter in the central box of
the system are analyzed. They can be well represented by a fast shock-wave
compression followed by a relatively slow isentropic expansion. The parameters
of collective flows and hadronic spectra are calculated under assumption of the
isochronous freeze-out. It is shown that the deconfinement phase transition
leads to broadening of proton rapidity distributions, increase of elliptic
flows and formation of the directed antiflow in the central rapidity region.
These effects are most pronounced at bombarding energies around 10 AGeV, when
the system spends the longest time in the mixed phase. From the comparison with
three-fluid calculations we conclude that the transparency effects are not so
important in central collisions at NICA-FAIR energies (below 30 AGeV).

Nature 466, 213] performed on the base of the muonic hydrogen spectroscopy

results derived from the atomic hydrogen spectroscopy. This large discrepancy
could come from the calculations of the Lamb shift in atomic hydrogen and
muonic hydrogen. Here we show that there is a gap in the standard bound-state
QED that may be the source of the discrepancy. This gap originates in the fact
that within the framework of this theory the QED corrections are described in
terms of the respective Green functions. The character of the time evolution of
a system which should manifest itself in the general definition of bound states
as stationary states of the system cannot be described in terms of the Green
functions. We present a consistent way of solving the bound-state problem in
QED starting from the condition of stationarity of the bound states. Formulae
for the energies and the vectors of the states of one-electron (muon) atoms
derived in this way indicate that the standard bound-state QED does not obey
the exact description of the atomic states and, as a result, the Lamb shift
obtained in its framework should be supplemented by an additional ""dynamical""
energy shift. It is shown that in this shift natural nonlocality of the
electromagnetic interaction that in describing the S matrix and the Green
functions is hidden in the renormalization procedure manifest itself
explicitly.

statistical mechanics work? As we know from the most used prescription of Gibbs
we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities and we find that
these phase averages agree very well with experiments. Clearly actual
experiments are not done on a hypothetical ensemble they are done on the actual
system in the laboratory and these experiments take a finite amount of time.
Thus it is usually argued that actual measurements are time averages and they
are equal to phase averages due to ergodicity. Aim of the present review is to
show that ergodicity is not relevant for equilibrium statistical mechanics
(with Tolman and Landau). We will see that the solution of the problem is in
the very peculiar nature of the macroscopic observables and with the very large
number of the degrees of freedom involved in macroscopic systems as first
pointed out by Khinchin. Similar arguments are used by Landau based upon the
approximate property of ""Statistical Independence"". We review these ideas in
detail and in some cases present a critique. We review the role of chaos
(classical and quantum) where it is important and where it is not important. We
criticise the ideas of E. T. Jaynes who says that the ergodic problem is
conceptual one and is related to the very concept of ensemble itself which is a
by-product of frequency theory of probability, and the ergodic problem becomes
irrelevant when the probabilities of various micro-states are interpreted with
Laplace-Bernoulli theory of Probability (Bayesian viewpoint). In the end we
critically review various quantum approaches (quantum-statistical typicality
approaches) to the foundations of statistical mechanics.

loops it is shown that the resulting motion is governed by the presence of an
outer tension barrier and an inner angular momentum barrier that are influenced
by the black hole gravitational field given by the mass M and the cosmic
repulsion given by the cosmological constant {\Lambda}. The gravitational
attraction could cause capturing of the string having low energy by the black
hole or trapping in its vicinity; with high enough energy, the string can
escape (scatter) to infinity. The role of the cosmic repulsion becomes
important in vicinity of the so-called static radius where the gravitational
attraction is balanced by the cosmic repulsion-it is demonstrated both in terms
of the effective potential of the string motion and the basin boundary method
reflecting its chaotic character, that a potential barrier exists along the
static radius behind which no trapped oscillations may exist. The trapped
states of the string loops, governed by the interplay of the gravitating mass M
and the cosmic repulsion, are allowed only in Schwarzschild-de Sitter
spacetimes with the cosmological parameter {\lambda}<{\lambda}_trap 0.00497.

phylogenetic tree starting from information concerning the evolutionary
relatedness of languages. The available information are typically lists of
homologous (lexical, phonological, syntactic) features or characters for many
different languages.
  From this perspective the reconstruction of language trees is an example of
inverse problems: starting from present, incomplete and often noisy,
information, one aims at inferring the most likely past evolutionary history. A
fundamental issue in inverse problems is the evaluation of the inference made.
A standard way of dealing with this question is to generate data with
artificial models in order to have full access to the evolutionary process one
is going to infer. This procedure presents an intrinsic limitation: when
dealing with real data sets, one typically does not know which model of
evolution is the most suitable for them. A possible way out is to compare
algorithmic inference with expert classifications. This is the point of view we
take here by conducting a thorough survey of the accuracy of reconstruction
methods as compared with the Ethnologue expert classifications. We focus in
particular on state-of-the-art distance-based methods for phylogeny
reconstruction using worldwide linguistic databases.
  In order to assess the accuracy of the inferred trees we introduce and
characterize two generalizations of standard definitions of distances between
trees. Based on these scores we quantify the relative performances of the
distance-based algorithms considered. Further we quantify how the completeness
and the coverage of the available databases affect the accuracy of the
reconstruction. Finally we draw some conclusions about where the accuracy of
the reconstructions in historical linguistics stands and about the leading
directions to improve it.

lead to the entanglement sudden death and sudden birth. When the frequencies of

densities in static mesons allow to test directly and in detail the wave
functions of quark models. These distributions are gauge invariant quantities
directly related to the spatial distribution of wave functions. We make a
detailed comparison of the recent lattice QCD results with our own quark
models, formulated previously for quite different purposes. We find a striking
agreement not only between our two quark models, but also with the lattice QCD
data for the ground state in an important range of distances up to about 4/GeV.
Moreover the agreement extends to the L=1 states [j^P=(1/2)^+]. An explanation
of several particular features completely at odds with the non-relativistic
approximation is provided. A rather direct, somewhat unexpected and of course
approximate relation between wave functions of certain quark models and QCD has
been established.

develop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters.
The first method uses the physical extent and morphology of Halpha emission to
estimate the ages of clusters younger than tau ~10 Myr. It is based on the
simple premise that the gas in very young (tau < few Myr) clusters is largely
coincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structure
surrounding the stars in slightly older clusters (e.g., tau ~5 Myr), and is in
a larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ~5-10 Myr). The
second method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel flux
variations within clusters and their ages. This method relies on the fact that
the brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around
10 Myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., M_V < -3.5) for ages older
than about 100 Myr. These two methods are the basis for a new morphological
classification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clusters
based on their appearance. We compare previous age estimates of clusters in M83
determined from fitting UBVI Halpha measurements using predictions from stellar
evolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find good
agreement at the ~95% level. The scatter within categories is ~0.1 dex in log
tau for young clusters (<10 Myr) and ~0.5 dex for older (>10 Myr) clusters. A
by-product of this study is the identification of 22 ""single-star"" HII regions
in M83, with central stars having ages ~4 Myr.

this Ricci curvature as a control on the amount of overlap between

the presence of triangles containing those vertices, or more precisely, the
local clustering coefficient, that is, the relative proportion of connected
neighbors among all the neighbors of a vertex. This suggests to derive lower
Ricci curvature bounds on graphs in terms of such local clustering
coefficients. We also study curvature dimension inequalities on graphs,

Left invertibility, i.e. injectivity of I/O map, is reduced to left
D-invertibility, under suitable conditions. While left invertibility takes into
account membership to sets of a given partition, left D-invertibility considers
only membership to a single set, and is much easier to detect. The condition

SDSS (MUCHFUSS) aims at finding sdBs with compact companions like supermassive
white dwarfs (M>1.0 Msun), neutron stars or black holes. The existence of such
systems is predicted by binary evolution theory and recent discoveries indicate
that they are likely to exist in our Galaxy. A determination of the orbital
parameters is sufficient to put a lower limit on the companion mass by
calculating the binary mass function. If this lower limit exceeds the
Chandrasekhar mass and no sign of a companion is visible in the spectra, the
existence of a massive compact companion is proven without the need for any
additional assumptions. We identified about 1100 hot subdwarf stars from the
SDSS by colour selection and visual inspection of their spectra. Stars with
high velocities have been reobserved and individual SDSS spectra have been
analysed. In total 127 radial velocity variable subdwarfs have been discovered.
Binaries with high RV shifts and binaries with moderate shifts within short
timespans have the highest probability of hosting massive compact companions.
Atmospheric parameters of 69 hot subdwarfs in these binary systems have been
determined by means of a quantitative spectral analysis. The atmospheric
parameter distribution of the selected sample does not differ from previously
studied samples of hot subdwarfs. The systems are considered the best
candidates to search for massive compact companions by follow-up time resolved
spectroscopy.

the absorption. Our sample includes 80 absorption systems for which the
absorbing galaxies have been identified, of which 54 are presented here for the
first time. The main results of this study are: (i) the surface density of
galaxies falls off exponentially with increasing impact parameter, b, from the
quasar sightline relative to a constant background of galaxies, with an
e-folding length of ~46 kpc. Galaxies with b >~ 100 kpc calculated at the
absorption redshift are statistically consistent with being unrelated to the
absorption system. (ii) log N(HI) is inversely correlated with b at the 3.0
sigma level of significance. DLA galaxies are found systematically closer to
the quasar sightline, by a factor of two, than are galaxies which give rise to
subDLAs or LLSs. The median impact parameter is 17.4 kpc for the DLA galaxy
sample, 33.3 kpc for the subDLA sample, and 36.4 kpc for the LLS sample. (iii)
Absorber galaxy luminosity relative to L*, L/L*, is not significantly

re-visited. A simple tight-binding framework is given to describe the systems
where all numerical calculations are made using the Green's function formalism.
First, we demonstrate electronic transport in four different polycyclic
hydrocarbon molecules, namely, benzene, napthalene, anthracene and tetracene.
It is observed that electron conduction through these molecular wires is highly
sensitive to molecule-to-electrode coupling strength and quantum interference
of electronic waves passing through different branches of the molecular ring.
Our investigations predict that to design a molecular electronic device, in
addition to the molecule itself, both the molecular coupling and
molecule-to-electrode interface geometry are highly important. Next, we make an
in-depth study to design classical logic gates with the help of simple
mesoscopic rings, based on the concept of Aharonov-Bohm effect. A single
mesoscopic ring or two such rings are used to establish the logical operations
where the key controlling parameter is the magnetic flux threaded by the ring.
The analysis might be helpful in fabricating meso-scale or nano-scale logic
gates. Finally, we address multi-terminal quantum transport through a single
benzene molecule using Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism. Quite interestingly we
see that a three-terminal benzene molecule can be operated as an electronic
transistor and this phenomenon is justified through current-voltage
characteristics. All these essential features of electron transport may provide
a basic theoretical framework to examine electron conduction through any
multi-terminal quantum system.

the equations of motion of the single-particle Green's function. A remarkable

the low density regime and it always provides a non-negative $< \hat{n}_{R

conveniently create various quantitive metric to asses their respective quality

methodologies that are currently in-use, that is it could well be applied for
projects managed in an adaptive, as well as in a formal approach. Eventually we
argue that the model could actually be implemented by already existing tools,

these forces is the thermal energy of the radiation that fills these worlds. In
the four-dimensional space, these forces are centrifugal. They operate in an
external for 3R-world spatial dimension and stretch it. In the
three-dimensional comoving coordinate system the centrifugal forces shows
themselves as forces of repulsion. Standard Einstein's equations do not
describe these forces.
  Written generalized Einstein's equation describing the dynamics of a
homogeneous isotropic universe, taking into consideration the centrifugal
forces of repulsion. We propose a cosmological model of the universe, based on
these equations. This model apply to explain the observation data.
