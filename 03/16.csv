exhibit strong modifications of the radiative damping rate and directional

numbers and polarizations orthogonal to the lattice plane exhibit superradiance
with a very short life time and a tightly confined emission direction. For
shorter wavelength and in plane polarization they can posses a long life time,
which beyond a critical wave number tends to infinity. Those excitons thus
become metastable and decoupled from the free radiation field. They can store a
single energy quantum for a long time and transfer the excitation over long

emission pattern can provide us with optical and electronic properties of

cosmological constant, the Holst modification and topological terms (Nieh-Yan,
Euler, and Pontryagin). We show that differentiability of the action is
automatically implemented by the the structure of the constrained BF model.
Finally, we calculate the AdS--Schwarzschild black hole entropy from the
Noether charge and we find that, unexpectedly, it does not depend on the
Immirzi parameter.

Increased precision over past measurements comes from: (1) more than doubling
the number of infrared observations of Cepheids in nearby SN hosts; (2)
increasing the sample of ideal SN Ia calibrators from six to eight; (3)
increasing by 20% the number of Cepheids with infrared observations in the
megamaser host NGC 4258; (4) reducing the difference in the mean metallicity of
the Cepheid comparison samples from \Delta log [O/H] = 0.08 to 0.05; and (5)
calibrating all optical Cepheid colors with one camera, WFC3, to remove
cross-instrument zero-point errors. Uncertainty in H0 from beyond the 1st rung
of the distance ladder is reduced from 3.5% to 2.3%. The measurement of H0 via
the geometric distance to NGC 4258 is 74.8 \pm 3.1 km s- 1 Mpc-1, a 4.1%
measurement including systematics. Better precision independent of NGC 4258
comes from two alternative Cepheid absolute calibrations: (1) 13 Milky Way
Cepheids with parallaxes and (2) 92 Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud with
multiple eclipsing binary distances, yielding 74.4 \pm 2.5 km s- 1 Mpc-1, a
3.4% uncertainty with systematics. Our best estimate uses all three
calibrations but a larger uncertainty afforded from any two: H0 = 73.8 \pm 2.4
km s- 1 Mpc-1 including systematics, a 3.3% uncertainty. The improvement in H0,
combined with WMAP7yr data, results in a constraint on the EOS parameter of
dark energy of w = -1.08 \pm 0.10 and Neff = 4.2 \pm 0.7 for the number of
relativistic species in the early universe. It also rules out the best-fitting

magnetic reconnection. This process in not only important for understanding the
origin and evolution of the large-scale magnetic field, but is seen as a
possibly efficient particle accelerator producing cosmic rays mainly through
the first order Fermi process. In this work we study the properties of particle
acceleration in reconnection zones and show that the velocity component
parallel to the magnetic field of test particles inserted in nearly
non-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) domains of reconnection without
including kinetic effects, such as pressure anisotropy, the Hall term, or
anomalous effects, increases exponentially. Also, the acceleration of the
perpendicular component is always possible in such models. We have found that
within contracting magnetic islands or current sheets the particles accelerate
predominantly through the first order Fermi process, as previously described,
while outside the current sheets and islands the particles experience mostly
drift acceleration due to magnetic fields gradients. Considering two
dimensional MHD models without a guide field, we find that the parallel
acceleration stops at some level. This saturation effect is however removed in
the presence of an out-of-plane guide field or in three dimensional models.
Therefore, we stress the importance of the guide field and fully three
dimensional studies for a complete understanding of the process of particle
acceleration in astrophysical reconnection environments.

and X-ray fluxes in all spectral states of Cyg X-1 using X-ray data from
RXTE/ASM, CGRO/BATSE, and Swift/BAT. In the hard state, the dominant spectral
variability is a changing of normalisation with fixed spectral shape, while in
the intermediate state the slope changes, with a pivot point around 10 keV. In
the soft state, the low energy X-ray emission dominates the bolometric flux
which is only loosely correlated with the high energy emission. In black hole
binaries in the hard state, the radio flux is generally found to depend on a
power of the X-ray flux, F_R ~ F_X^p. We confirm this for Cyg X-1. Our new
finding is that this correlation extends to the intermediate and soft states
provided the broad-band X-ray flux in the Comptonization part of the spectrum
(excluding the blackbody component) is considered instead of a narrow-band
medium-energy X-ray flux. We find an index p=1.7+-0.1 for 15 GHz radio
emission, decreasing to p=1.5+-0. at 2.25 GHz. We conclude that the higher
value at 15 GHz is due to the effect of free-free absorption in the wind from
the companion. The intrinsic correlation index remains uncertain. However,
based on a theoretical model of the wind in Cyg X-1, it appears to be close to
1.3, which, in the framework of accretion/jet models, implies that the
accretion flow in Cyg X-1 is radiatively efficient. The correlation with the
flux due to Comptonization emission indicates that the radio jet is launched by
the hot electrons in the accretion flow in all spectral states of Cyg X-1. On
the other hand, we rule out the X-ray jet model. Finally, we find that the
index of the correlation, when measured using the X-ray flux in a narrow energy
band, strongly depends on the band chosen and is, in general, different from
that for either the bolometric flux or the flux in the hot-electron emission.

emitters, from radio to gamma rays. This broadband emission is thought to come
from the region where the companion star and pulsar winds collide. A

high-energy radiation probes the shock structure at the binary scale, the radio
emission is produced well outside the system, in regions where the shocked
stellar and pulsar winds are likely mixing due to hydrodynamical instabilities.
Understanding the evolution of the shocked flow depends strongly on a proper

calculations of the radio emission produced in a high-mass binary hosting a
young pulsar. Adopting a prescription for the shocked flow in the system and
the non-thermal particle injection, we have generated synthetic radio emission

the emitting bulk flow should be rather slow, with a pulsar wind magnetization
at the shock higher than in isolated pulsars.

measures the spatial extent of line emission to sub-milliarcsecond precision,

gas-rich disks surrounding stars with spectral types ranging from K to A. The
properties of the spectro-astrometric signals divide the sources into two
distinct phenomenological classes: one that shows clear Keplerian astrometric
spectra, and one in which the astrometric signatures are dominated by gas with
strong non-Keplerian (radial) motions. Similarly to the near-infrared continuum
emission, as determined by interferometry, we find that the size of the CO line
emitting region in the Keplerian sources obeys a size-luminosity relation as
$R_CO L_*^0.5. The non-Keplerian spectro-astrometric signatures are likely
indicative of the presence of wide-angle disk winds. The central feature of the
winds is a strong sub-Keplerian velocity field due to conservation of angular
momentum as the wind pressure drives the gas outwards. We construct a
parametrized 2-dimensional disk+wind model that reproduces the observed
characteristics the observed CO spectra and astrometry. The modeled winds
indicate mass-loss rates of >10^-10 to 10^-8 Msol/yr. We suggest a unifying
model in which all disks have slow molecular winds, but where the magnitude of
the mass-loss rate determines the degree to which the mid-infrared molecular
lines are dominated by the wind relative to the Keplerian disk surface.

parameters describing a phase transition to two-flavor quark matter at higher
critical densities. These models possess a distinctly different temperature
dependence of their transition densities which turns out to be crucial for the
possible appearance of quark matter in supernova cores. During the early post
bounce accretion phase quark matter is found only if the phase transition takes
place at sufficiently low densities as in the study based on the bag model. The
increase critical density with increasing temperature, as obtained for our PNJL
parametrization, prevents the formation of quark matter. The further evolution
of the core collapse supernova as obtained applying the quark bag model leads
to a structural reconfiguration of the central proto-neutron star where, in
addition to a massive pure quark matter core, a strong hydrodynamic shock wave
forms and a second neutrino burst is released during the shock propagation
across the neutrinospheres. We discuss the severe constraints in the freedom of

where signals travel around the feedback loop, it is unconventional from a

specific light-cone singularities of the Wilson loop, the equations of motion
produce a nontrivial finite contribution which breaks some of the classical

supersymmetry already at one loop, thus invalidating the conjectured duality
between Wilson loops and non-MHV scattering amplitudes. We compute the

September 19, 2001 March 22 and 2002 September 28, respectively. We estimate
the disk size, luminosity and temperature, which are consistent with a black
hole mass ~10 M_{sun}. There is much overlap between the range of total X-ray
luminosities (on average ~0.02 L_{Edd}) in the hard and soft states, and
probably between the corresponding mass accretion rates; in fact, the hard
state is often more luminous. The extended radio lobes seen in 1992 and 1997
are still present in 2008-2009. The 5-GHz radio core flux density has shown
variability between ~0.1-0.5 mJy over the last two decades. This firmly places
GRS 1758-258 in the radio-quiet sequence of Galactic black holes, in the
radio/X-ray plane. We note that this dichotomy is similar to the dichotomy
between the radio/X-ray sequences of Seyfert and radio galaxies. We propose
that the different radio efficiency of the two sequences is due to relativistic
electron/positron jets in radio-loud black holes, and sub-relativistic,
thermally dominated outflows in radio-quiet sources.

consistent with a Neutron Stars (NSs) origin for these events. Furthermore, we
use the data to measure the sources variability on days to years time scales,

problem proves to be rich enough to capture interesting features of problems of

an abelian group, the more general case studied here does not seem to allow

a dipole magnetic field strength of less than 7.5 x 10^{12} G (Rea et al.

of the properties inferred from X-ray timing, the X-ray spectra of neutron
stars allow a measurement of their magnetic field strengths because they are
distorted from pure blackbodies due to the presence of a magnetic field in a
radiative equilibrium atmosphere. In this paper, we model high signal-to-noise
XMM-Newton spectra of SGR 0418+5729 to place constraints on the strength of the
magnetic field at the surface of the neutron star. Our analysis shows that
neutron star atmosphere models with moderate magnetic field strengths

magnetic fields are able to account for the observations. We find that the
strength of the magnetic field at the surface is 1.0 x 10^{14} G. This value,
although lower than all of the other SGRs analyzed to date, is still high
enough to generate the observed X-ray bursts from the source. In connection to

Since atmospheric water vapor is the dominant source of absorption and
increased thermal background in the infrared, both projects included
precipitable water vapor (PWV) measurements in their corresponding site testing
campaigns. TMT planned to monitor PWV at the sites of interest by means of
using infrared radiometers. Technical failures and calibration issues prevented
them from having a sufficiently long PWV time-series to characterize the sites
using this method. Therefore, for the sites in Chile TMT used surface water
vapor density measurements, which taken together with an assumed water vapor
scale height, allowed for the estimation of PWV. On the other hand, the E-ELT
team conducted dedicated PWV measurement campaigns at two of their observatory
sites using radiosonde soundings to validate historical time-series of PWV
reconstructed by way of a spectroscopic analysis of astronomical standard
sources observed at the La Silla and the Paranal sites. The E-ELT also
estimated the median PWV for the Armazones site from extrapolation of their
Paranal statistics accounting for the difference in elevation between the two
places; and also from archival analysis of radiosonde data available from the
city of Antofagasta by integration of the humidity profile starting from 3000 m
altitude. In the case of the Armazones site, the published median of PWV by
both groups differ by about 1 mm with the E-ELT values being drier than those
estimated by the TMT group. This work looks at some of the reasons that could
explain this difference, among them the water vapor scale height, the
horizontal variability of the water vapor field, and an unaccounted correction
due to a dry bias known to affect the radiosondes relative humidity sensors.

first-principle Liouville equation and applying the Mori-Zwanzig projection
operator technique, we derive the Generalized Langevin Equations (GLE) for the
coarse-grained representations of the liquid. The chosen slow variables in the
projection operators define the length scale of coarse graining. Each polymer
is represented at two levels of coarse-graining: monomeric as a bead-and-spring
model and molecular as a soft-colloid. In the long-time regime where the
center-of-mass follows Brownian motion and the internal dynamics is completely
relaxed, the two descriptions must be equivalent. By enforcing this formal
relation we derive from the GLEs the analytical rescaling factors to be applied
to dynamical data in the coarse-grained representation to recover the monomeric
description. Change in entropy and change in friction are the two corrections
to be accounted for to compensate the effects of coarse-graining on the polymer
dynamics. The solution of the memory functions in the coarse-grained
representations provides the dynamical rescaling of the friction coefficient.
The calculation of the internal degrees of freedom provides the correction of
the change in entropy due to coarse-graining. The resulting rescaling formalism
is a function of the coarse-grained model and thermodynamic parameters of the
system simulated. The rescaled dynamics obtained from mesoscale simulations of
polyethylene, represented as soft colloidal particles, by applying our
rescaling approach shows a good agreement with data of translational diffusion
measured experimentally and from simulations. The proposed method is used to

be as much as an order of magnitude at early times, but declines at later times

particle motion locks to symmetry directions of the substrate, producing a
series of steps in the velocity-force curves. The locking transitions coincide
with structural transitions between triangular, square, smectic, or disordered
particle arrangements, which can be identified using the structure factor. We
show that the widths of the locking steps pass through local minima and maxima
as a function of the ratio of the number of particles to the number of
substrate minima. Unlike a static system, where matching effects occur for
simple integer commensuration ratios, our system exhibits dynamical
commensuration effects where an integer number of particle chains flow between
one-dimensional lines of substrate minima. As the system enters and exits the
locking steps, order-disorder transitions in the structure of the moving
particle assembly occur. We identify two distinct symmetry locking regimes as a
function of substrate strength which produce different locking step
characteristics. For weak substrates, all the particles are in motion and a
portion of the particles flow through the substrate minima, leading to
structural transitions at certain driving angles. For strong substrates, some
particles are permanently pinned while the remaining particles flow around
them. At the crossover between these two regimes of substrate strength, the
locking steps are destroyed due to the onset of chaotic plastic flow which
produces pronounced changes in the transport characteristics. Similar effects
occur for colloidal particles driven over square and triangular substrate

the exact mechanism and environment in which it takes place remain unknown. We
explore the effects of an off-center initiated detonation on the spatial
distribution of the nucleosynthetic yield products in a toy model -- a
pre-expanded near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. We find that a single-point
near edge-lit detonation results in asymmetries in the density and thermal
profiles, notably the expansion timescale, throughout the supernova ejecta. We
demonstrate that this asymmetry of the thermodynamic trajectories should be
common to off-center detonations where a small amount of the star is burned
prior to detonation. The sensitivity of the yields on the expansion timescale
results in an asymmetric distribution of the elements synthesized as reaction
products. We tabulate the shift in the center of mass of the various elements
produced in our model supernova and find an odd-even pattern for elements past
silicon. Our calculations show that off-center single-point detonations in
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are marked by significant composition asymmetries in
their remnants which bear potentially observable signatures in both velocity
and coordinate space, including an elemental nickel mass fraction which varies
by a factor of two to three from one side of the remnant to the other.

the Earth's climate will jump (tip) to a different state, the current stable
state lies within a shrinking basin of attraction. Persistence of the state
becomes increasingly precarious in the presence of noisy disturbances. We
consider an underlying potential, as defined theoretically for a saddle-node
fold and (via averaging) for a Hopf bifurcation. Close to a stable state, this
potential has a parabolic form; but approaching a jump it becomes increasingly
dominated by softening nonlinearities. If we have already detected a decrease
in the linear decay rate, nonlinear information allows us to estimate the
propensity for early tipping due to noise. We argue that one needs to extract
information about the nonlinear features (a ""softening"") of the underlying
potential from the time series to judge the probability and timing of tipping.
This analysis is the logical next step if one has detected a decrease of the
linear decay rate. If there is no discernable trend in the linear analysis,
nonlinear softening is even more important in showing the proximity to tipping.
After extensive normal form calibration studies, we check two geological time
series from paleo-climate tipping events for softening of the underlying well.
For the ending of the last ice age, where we find no convincing linear
precursor, we identify a statistically significant nonlinear softening towards
increasing temperature. The analysis has thus successfully detected a warning

an active accretion disk, and a massive protostar. For the first time for such
models, an optically thick inner gas disk extends inside the dust destruction
front. This is important to conserve the accretion energy naturally and for its
shielding effect on the outer region of the disk and envelope. The simulation
of radiation transfer is performed with the Monte Carlo code of Whitney,
yielding spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the model series, from the
simplest spherical model to the fiducial one, with the above components each
added step-by-step. Images are also presented in different wavebands of various
telescope cameras, including Spitzer IRAC and MIPS, SOFIA FORCAST and Herschel
PACS and SPIRE. The existence of the optically thick inner disk produces higher
optical wavelength fluxes but reduces near- and mid-IR emission. The presence
of outflow cavities, the inclination angle to the line of sight, and the
thickness of the disk all affect the SEDs and images significantly. For the
high mass surface density cores considered here, the mid-IR emission can be
dominated by the outflow cavity walls, as has been suggested by De Buizer. The
effect of varying the pressure of the environment bounding the surface of the
massive core is also studied. With lower surface pressures, the core is larger,
has lower extinction and accretion rates, and the observed mid-IR flux from the
disk can then be relatively high even though the accretion luminosity is lower.
In this case the silicate absorption feature becomes prominent, in contrast to
higher density cores forming under higher pressures.

in the past decade. The maps produced by such instruments typically include the
filtering effects of the instrument as well as those from subsequent steps
performed in the reduction of the data. Therefore interpretation of the maps is
dependent upon accurately calculating the transfer function of the chosen
reduction technique on the signal of interest. Many of these instruments use
non-linear and iterative techniques to reduce their data because such methods
can offer improved signal-to-noise over those that are purely linear,
particularly for signals at scales comparable to that subtended by the array.
We discuss a general approach for measuring the transfer function of principal
component analysis (PCA) on point sources that are small compared to the
spatial extent seen by any single bolometer within the array. The results are
applied to previously released AzTEC catalogues of the COSMOS, Lockman Hole,

of the size of the fragments of the disconnected graph can be used as a metric
about the damage of a graph by the removal of an edge or a node. This damage is
reported in the range (0,1) where 0 means that the removal had no effect on the
graph's capability to perform its functions. A 1 means that the graph is
totally dysfunctional. We exercise our metric on a collection of sample graphs

the damage done to the graph by an attacker, and that it can be used in
evaluating the positive effect of adding additional edges to an existing graph.

infrared (IR) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (FUV) luminosity ratio. We explore
trends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (SFR) and redshift in order to
identify possible systematics in these various measures. We reiterate the
finding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the Balmer
decrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrained
when derived from only two broad passbands in the UV. We also emphasise that
FUV derived SFRs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will be
overestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuation
factor is used. Even in the optimum case, the resulting SFRs have a significant
scatter, well over an order of magnitude. While there is a stronger correlation
between the IR to FUV luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with the
Balmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, and
dust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy SFRs must be treated
with caution. We conclude with a description of the extent to which the
different obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as the
effects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

H2 emission lines were detected. Except the clump B, the extinctioncorrected
level population shows the ortho-to-para ratio of ~ 3.0. From the level
population of the clumps C and G-both AKARI's only and the one extended with
previous mid-infrared observations-we found that the v = 0 levels are more
populated than the v > 0 levels at a fixed level energy, which cannot be
reproduced by any combination of H2 gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. The
populations are described by the two-density power-law thermal admixture model,
revised to include the collisions with H atoms. We attributed the lower
(n(H2)=10^(2.8-3.8) cm-3) and higher (n(H2)=10^(5.4-5.8) cm-3) density gases to
the shocked H2 gas behind C-type and J-type shocks, respectively, based on
several arguments including the obtained high H I abundance n(H I)/n(H2)=0.01.
Under the hierarchical picture of molecular clouds, the C-type and J-type
shocks likely propagate into ""clumps"" and ""clouds"" (interclump media),
respectively. The power-law index b of 1.6 and 3.5, mainly determined by the
lower density gas, is attributed to the shock-velocity diversity, which may be
a natural result during shock-cloud interactions. According to our results, H2
v = 1 - 0 S(1) emission is mainly from J-shocks propagating into interclump
media. The H2 emission was also detected at the background region, and this
diffuse H2 emission may originate from collisional process in addition to the
ultraviolet photon pumping.

configurations to produce maps with an effective resolution of $\sim$
2.5\arcsec at high signal-to-noise in CN, C$^{18}$O, HCN, HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$,
and two continuum bands (91.2 GHz and 112 GHz). These data allow us to compare
tracer molecules associated with both low and high density regions to infer gas
properties. We determine that CARMA resolves out approximately 35% of the CN
emission around W3(OH) when compared with spectra obtained from the IRAM-30
meter telescope. The presence of strong absorption lines towards the continuum
source in three of the molecular transitions infers the presence of a cold,
dark, optically thick region in front of the continuum source. In addition, the
presence of high-velocity emission lines near the continuum source shows the
presence of hot clumpy emission behind the continuum source. These data
determine that future high-resolution interferometric CN Zeeman measurements
which cannot currently be performed (due to technical limitations of current
telescopes) are feasible. We confirm that CN is indeed a good tracer for high
density regions; with certain objects such as W3(OH) it appears to be a more

exponential family distribution and different arms are assigned independent
conjugate priors. At each of n stages, one arm is to be selected based on past
observations. The goal is to find a strategy that maximizes the expected
discounted sum of the $n$ observations. Two structural results hold in broad
generality: (i) for a fixed prior weight, an arm becomes more desirable as its
prior mean increases; (ii) for a fixed prior mean, an arm becomes more
desirable as its prior weight decreases. These generalize and unify several
results in the literature concerning specific problems including Bernoulli and
normal bandits. The second result captures an aspect of the
exploration-exploitation dilemma in precise terms: given the same immediate
payoff, the less one knows about an arm, the more desirable it becomes because
there remains more information to be gained when selecting that arm. For
Bernoulli and normal bandits we also obtain extensions to nonconjugate priors.

resource allocation for the downlink OFDMA with universal frequency reuse.
Unlike the traditional scheme that treats subcarriers as separate dimensions
for resource allocation, the IA technique is utilized to enable
frequency-domain precoding over parallel subcarriers. In this paper, the joint
optimization of frequency-domain precoding via IA, subcarrier user selection
and power allocation is investigated for a cooperative three-cell OFDMA system
to maximize the downlink throughput. Numerical results for a simplified
symmetric channel setup reveal that the IA-based scheme achieves notable
throughput gains over the traditional scheme only when the inter-cell
interference link has a comparable strength as the direct link, and the
receiver SNR is sufficiently large. Motivated by this observation, a practical
hybrid scheme is proposed for cellular systems with heterogenous channel
conditions, where the total spectrum is divided into two subbands, over which
the IAbased scheme and the traditional scheme are applied for resource
allocation to users located in the cell-intersection region and cellnon-
intersection region, respectively. It is shown that this hybrid resource
allocation scheme flexibly exploits the downlink IA gains for OFDMA-based
cellular systems.

problem. The quantum computer could be used for execution of very complicated
tasks which are not solvable with the classical computers. The first prototype
of solid state quantum computer was created in 2009 with superconducting
qubits. However, it suffers from the decoherent processes and it is desirable
to find more practical encoding of qubits with long-lived coherence. It could
be single impurity or vacancy centers in solids, but their interaction with
electromagnetic radiation is rather weak. So, here, ensembles of atoms were
proposed for the qubit encoding by using the dipole blockade mechanism in order
to turn multilevel systems in two level ones. But dipole-dipole based blockade
introduces an additional decoherence that limits its practical significance.
Recently, the collective blockade mechanism has been proposed for the system of
three-level atoms by using the different frequency shifts for the Raman
transitions between the collective atomic states characterized by a different
number of the excited atoms. Here, we propose two qubit gate by using another
collective blockade mechanism in the system of two level atoms based on
exchange interaction via the virtual photons between the multi-atomic ensembles

by the states of photon encoded qubit.

three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of these planets. Under
strongly irradiated conditions, models of tidally locked, short-period planets
(both hot Jupiters and terrestrial planets) tend to exhibit a circulation
dominated by a fast eastward, or ""superrotating,"" jet stream at the equator.
Under appropriate conditions, this phenomenon can cause the hottest regions to
be displaced eastward from the substellar point by tens of degrees longitude.
Such an offset has been observed on HD 189733b, supporting the possibility of
equatorial jets on short-period exoplanets. Despite its relevance, however, the
dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the equatorial superrotation in
such models have not been identified. Here, we show that the equatorial jet
results from the interaction of the mean flow with standing, planetary-scale
Rossby and Kelvin waves induced by the day-night thermal forcing. The Rossby
waves develop phase tilts that pump eastward momentum from high latitudes to
the equator, thereby inducing equatorial superrotation. We present an analytic
theory demonstrating this mechanism and explore its properties in a hierarchy
of one-layer (shallow-water) calculations and fully 3D models. The
wave-mean-flow interaction produces an equatorial jet whose latitudinal width
is comparable to that of the Rossby waves, namely the equatorial Rossby
deformation radius modified by radiative and frictional effects. For conditions
typical of synchronously rotating hot Jupiters, this length is comparable to a
planetary radius, explaining the broad scale of the equatorial jet obtained in
most hot Jupiter models. Our theory illuminates the dependence of the
equatorial jet speed on forcing amplitude, strength of friction, and other
parameters, as well as the conditions under which jets can form at all.

$J\subseteq I$ of a commutative ring $R$, the Aluffi algebra of $I/J$ is called
Aluffi torsion-free if it is isomorphic to the Rees algebra of $I/J$. In this
paper, ideals generated by 2-minors of a $2\times n$ matrix of linear forms and

Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A secret-key generation scheme based on a layered broadcasting strategy is
introduced for slow-fading channels. In the model considered, Alice wants to
share a key with Bob while keeping the key secret from Eve, who is a passive
eavesdropper. Both Alice-Bob and Alice-Eve channels are assumed to undergo slow
fading, and perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known only
at the receivers during the transmission. In each fading slot, Alice broadcasts
a continuum of coded layers and, hence, allows Bob to decode at the rate
corresponding to the fading state (unknown to Alice). The index of a reliably
decoded layer is sent back from Bob to Alice via a public and error-free
channel and used to generate a common secret key. In this paper, the achievable
secrecy key rate is first derived for a given power distribution over coded
layers. The optimal power distribution is then characterized. It is shown that
layered broadcast coding can increase the secrecy key rate significantly
compared to single-level coding.

\emph{an $(n,M,d)$ code $\C$ in projective space} is a subset of $\Ps$ of size

is described by an antisymmetric $2\choose 2$-tensor $\kappa$. In this setting,
the Tamm-Rubilar tensor density determines a polynomial surface of fourth order
in each cotangent space. This surface is called the Fresnel surface and acts as
a generalisation of the light-cone determined by a Lorentz metric; the Fresnel
surface parameterises electromagnetic wave-speed as a function of direction.
Favaro and Bergamin have recently proven that if $\kappa$ has only a principal

Lorentz metric $g$, then $\kappa$ is proportional to the Hodge star operator of
$g$. That is, under additional assumptions, the Fresnel surface of $\kappa$
determines the conformal class of $\kappa$. The purpose of this paper is
twofold. First, we provide a new proof of this result using Gr\""obner bases.
Second, we describe a number of cases where the Fresnel surface does not
determine the conformal class of the original $2\choose 2$-tensor $\kappa$. For

(ROBDD) is one of the most influential target languages. We generalize ROBDD by
associating some implied literals in each node and the new language is called
reduced ordered binary decision diagram with implied literals (ROBDD-L). Then
we discuss a kind of subsets of ROBDD-L called ROBDD-i with precisely i implied
literals (0 \leq i \leq \infty). In particular, ROBDD-0 is isomorphic to ROBDD;
ROBDD-\infty requires that each node should be associated by the implied
literals as many as possible. We show that ROBDD-i has uniqueness over some
specific variables order, and ROBDD-\infty is the most succinct subset in
ROBDD-L and can meet most of the querying requirements involved in the
knowledge compilation map. Finally, we propose an ROBDD-i compilation algorithm
for any i and a ROBDD-\infty compilation algorithm. Based on them, we implement
a ROBDD-L package called BDDjLu and then get some conclusions from preliminary
experimental results: ROBDD-\infty is obviously smaller than ROBDD for all
benchmarks; ROBDD-\infty is smaller than the d-DNNF the benchmarks whose
compilation results are relatively small; it seems that it is better to
transform ROBDDs-\infty into FBDDs and ROBDDs rather than straight compile the

flares and how is the radiated energy spectrally distributed. We perform a
superposed epoch analysis of spectral and total irradiance measurements
obtained since 1996 by the SOHO and GOES spacecrafts at various wavelength,
from Soft X-ray to the visible domain. The long-term record of solar irradiance
and excellent duty cycle of the measurements allow us to detect a signal in
visible irradiance even for moderate (C-class) flares, mainly during the
impulsive phase. We identify this signal as continuum emission emitted by
white-light flares, and find that it is consistent with a blackbody emission at
~9000K. We estimate for several sets of flares the contribution of the WL
continuum and find it to be of ~70% of the total radiated energy. We re-analyse
the X17 flare that occurred on 28 October 2003 and find similar results. This
paper brings evidence that all flares are white-light flares and that the
white-light continuum is the main contributor to the total radiated energy;
this continuum is consistent with blackbody spectrum at ~9000K. These
observational results are important in order to understand the physical

In particular, two major flares that occur after the pariastron passage were
observed. The onset of gamma-ray emission occurs close to, but not at the same
orbital phases as, the two disk passages that occur ~1 month before and ~1
month after the pariastron passage. The fact that the GeV orbital light curve

GeV gamma-ray emission originates from a different component. We speculate that
the observed GeV flares may be resulting from Doppler boosting effects.

the calculation of the imaginary part of the action for outgoing particle. And
two ways are known for achieving this goal: the null-geodesic method and the
Hamilton-Jacobi method. We apply these methods to the charged black holes in 2D
dilaton gravity which is originated from the low energy effective theory of
type 0A string theory. We derive the correct Hawking temperature of the black
holes including the effect of the back reaction of the radiation, and obtain
the entropy by using the 1st law of black hole thermodynamics. For fixed-charge
ensemble, the 0A black holes are free of phase transition and thermodynamically
stable regardless of mass-charge ratio. We show this by interpreting the back
reaction term as the inverse of the heat capacity of the black holes. Finally,
the possibility of the phase transition in the fixed-potential ensemble is
discussed.

Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories (LCFTs) are already present in some finite
lattice systems (such as the XXZ spin-1/2 chain) before the continuum limit is
taken. This has provided a very convenient way to analyze the structure of
indecomposable Virasoro modules and to obtain fusion rules for a variety of
models such as (boundary) percolation etc. LCFTs allow for additional quantum
numbers describing the fine structure of the indecomposable modules, and
generalizing the `b-number' introduced initially by Gurarie for the c=0 case.
The determination of these indecomposability parameters has given rise to a lot
of algebraic work, but their physical meaning has remained somewhat elusive. In
a recent paper, a way to measure b for boundary percolation and polymers was
proposed. We generalize this work here by devising a general strategy to
compute matrix elements of Virasoro generators from the numerical analysis of
lattice models and their continuum limit. The method is applied to XXZ spin-1/2
and spin-1 chains with open (free) boundary conditions. They are related to
gl(n+m|m) and osp(n+2m|2m)-invariant superspin chains and to nonlinear sigma
models with supercoset target spaces. These models can also be formulated in
terms of dense and dilute loop gas. We check the method in many cases where the
results were already known analytically. Furthermore, we also confront our
findings with a construction generalizing Gurarie's, where logarithms emerge
naturally in operator product expansions to compensate for apparently divergent
terms. This argument actually allows us to compute indecomposability parameters
in any logarithmic theory. A central result of our study is the construction of
a Kac table for the indecomposability parameters of the logarithmic minimal
models LM(1,p) and LM(p,p+1).

angle and the time delay of a photon trajectory in the Schwarzschild metric

the isotropic Schwarzschild coordinate system. We identify a coordinate
dependent term in the time delay which becomes irrelevant for the arrival time
difference of two images. It deems necessary to sort out unambiguously what is
what we measure. We calculate the second order corrections for the deflection
angle and time delay. The CSTD does generate correct lens equations including
multiple scattering lens equations under the variations and may be best
understood as a generating function. It is presently unclear what the

to this approach is to take pure virtual braids as primary. The generators of

two characteristic parameters, {\it r} and {\it b}, whose accurate values can
be obtained exclusively by accurate methods of the quantum statistics (by
explicit use of the Planck's or Bose-Einstein distribution). In this work we
prove that the complete quantum thermodynamics of the black body photon gas can
be done by simple, thermodynamic (non-statistical) methods. We prove that both
mentioned parameters and corresponding variables (photons number and pressure)
can be obtained very simply and practically exactly (with relative error about
few percent), by non-statistical (without any use of the Planck's or
Bose-Einstein distribution), quantum thermodynamic methods. Corner-stone of
these methods represents a quantum thermodynamic stability condition that is,
in some degree, very similar to quantum stability condition in the Bohr quantum
atomic theory (de Broglie's interpretation of the Bohr quantization postulate).
Finally, we discuss conceptual similarities between black body photon gas

strip, a coupling occurs between the acoustic oscillations and the convective
motions close to the surface.The best topical models that account for this
coupling rely on 1-D time-dependent convection (TDC) formulations. However,
their intrinsic weakness comes from the large number of unconstrained free
parameters entering in the description of turbulent convection. Aims: We
compare two widely used TDC models with the first two-dimensional nonlinear
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the convection-pulsation coupling in
which the acoustic oscillations are self-sustained by the kappa-mechanism.
Methods: The free parameters appearing in the Stellingwerf and Kuhfuss TDC
recipes are constrained using a chi2-test with the time-dependent convective
flux that evolves in nonlinear simulations of highly-compressible convection
with kappa-mechanism. Results: This work emphasises some inherent limits of TDC
models, that is, the temporal variability and non-universality of their free
parameters. More importantly, within these limits, Stellingwerf's formalism is
found to give better spatial and temporal agreements with the nonlinear
simulation than Kuhfuss's one. It may therefore be preferred in 1-D TDC
hydrocodes or stellar evolution codes.

oscillations of hard X-rays during impulsive phase of solar flares. We have
come to conclusion that they are caused by magnetosonic oscillations of
magnetic traps within the volume of hard-X-ray (HXR) loop-top sources. In the
present paper we investigate four flares which show clear quasi-periodic
sequences of HXR pulses. We also describe our phenomenological model of
oscillating magnetic traps to show that it can explain observed properties of
HXR oscillations. Main results are the following: 1. We have found that
low-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations occur before impulsive phase of some
flares. 2. We have found that quasi-period of the oscillations can change in
some flares. We interpret this as being due to changes of the length of
oscillating magnetic traps. 3. During impulsive phase a significant part of the
energy of accelerated (non-thermal) electrons is deposited within the HXR
loop-top source. 4. Our analysis suggests that quick development of impulsive
phase is due to feedback between pulses of the pressure of accelerated
electrons and the amplitude of magnetic-trap oscillation. 5. We have also
determined electron number density and magnetic filed strength for HXR loop-top
sources of several flares. The values fall within the limits of $N \approx (2
-15) \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, $B \approx (45 - 130)$ gauss.

demonstrate that it displays the freeze of the fidelity. During the freeze, the
average fidelity exhibits periodic revivals at integer values of the Heisenberg

we find that the periodicity of the revivals during the freeze of fidelity is
an integer fraction of $t_H$, thus relating the period of the revivals with the

we inferred that upward slow rising motion of an inverse S-shaped filament
lying along the polarity inversion line (PIL) resulted in a CME subsequent to a
two-ribbon flare. Interaction of overlying field line across the filament with
side lobe field lines, associated EUV brightening, and flux
emergence/cancellation around the filament were the observational signatures of
the processes leading to its destabilization and the onset of eruption.
Moreover, the rising motion profile of filament/flux rope corresponded well
with flare characteristics, viz., the reconnection rate and HXR emission
profiles. Flux rope accelerated to the maximum velocities as a CME at the peak
phase of the flare, followed by deceleration to an average velocity of 590
kms$^{-1}$. We suggest that the observed emergence/cancellation of magnetic
fluxes near the filament caused it to rise, resulting in the tethers to cut and
reconnection to take place beneath the filament; in agreement with the tether
cutting model. The corresponding increase/decrease in positive/negative
photospheric fluxes found in the post-peak phase of the eruption provides
unambiguous evidence of reconnection as a consequence of tether cutting.

reasonable values for primordial non-Gaussian perturbations, it turns out that
they are responsible for: (i) altering early molecular fractions in the cold,
dense gas phase of ~10 per cent; (ii) inducing small temperature fluctuations
of <~10 per cent during the cosmic evolution of primordial objects; (iii)
influencing the onset of the first star formation events, at z>~15, and of the
popIII/popII transition of up to some 10^7yr; (iv) determining variations of
<~10 per cent in the gas cloud and stellar mass distributions after the
formation of the first structures; (v) causing only mild variations in the
chemical history of the Universe. We stress, though, that purely non-Gaussian

interaction between dark energy and dark matter. The dark sector interaction in
our scenario is free of the assumption that the interaction term $Q$ is
proportional to the Hubble expansion rate and the energy densities of dark
sectors. We only use a time-variable coupling $b(a)$ (with $a$ the scale factor
of the universe) to characterize the interaction $Q$. We propose a
parametrization form for the running coupling $b(a)=b_0a+b_e(1-a)$ in which the
early-time coupling is given by a constant $b_e$, while today the coupling is
given by another constant, $b_0$. For investigating the feature of the running
coupling, we employ three dark energy models, namely, the cosmological constant
model ($w=-1$), the constant $w$ model ($w=w_0$), and the time-dependent $w$
model ($w(a)=w_0+w_1(1-a)$). We constrain the models with the current
observational data, including the type Ia supernova, the baryon acoustic
oscillation, the cosmic microwave background, the Hubble expansion rate, and
the X-ray gas mass fraction data. The fitting results indicate that a
time-varying vacuum scenario is favored, in which the coupling $b(z)$ crosses
the noninteracting line ($b=0$) during the cosmological evolution and the sign
changes from negative to positive. The crossing of the noninteracting line
happens at around $z=0.2-0.3$, and the crossing behavior is favored at about
1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our work implies that we should pay more attention
to the time-varying vacuum model and seriously consider the phenomenological
construction of a sign-changeable or oscillatory interaction between dark
sectors.

samples extracted from the SDSS, its radio- and/or X-ray properties have not
been taken into account for its derivation. Thus, because its selection is
based on optical properties alone, it may be less prone to selection effects
inherent in other samples derived at different frequencies, so it offers a
unique opportunity to extract the first unbiased BL Lac luminosity function
that is suitably large in size.
  We found 124 out of 182 targets (68%) to be polarized, 95 of the polarized
targets (77%) to be highly polarized (> 4%). The low-frequency peaked BL Lac
candidates in the sample are on average only slightly more polarized than the
high-frequency peaked ones. Compared to earlier studies, we found a high duty
cycle in high polarization (~66 +2/-14% to be > 4% polarized) in high-frequency
peaked BL Lac candidates. This may come from our polarization analysis, which
minimizes the contamination by host galaxy light.
  No evidence of radio-quiet BL Lac objects in the sample was found.
  Our observations show that the probable sample of BL Lac candidates of
Collinge et al. (2005) indeed contains a large number of bona fide BL Lac
objects. High S/N spectroscopy and deep X-ray observations are required to
construct the first luminosity function of optically selected BL Lac objects

momentum and wave vector, introduced for matter waves by de Broglie, are
rigorously valid in the presence of gravity. In this paper, we show this to be
true for Dirac equations in a background of gravitational and electromagnetic
fields. We first transform any Dirac equation into an equivalent canonical
form, sometimes used in particular cases to solve Dirac equations in a curved
spacetime. This canonical form is needed to apply the Whitham Lagrangian
method. The latter method, unlike the WKB method, places no restriction on the
magnitude of Planck's constant to obtain wave packets, and furthermore
preserves the symmetries of the Dirac Lagrangian. We show using canonical Dirac
fields in a curved spacetime, that the probability current has a Gordon
decomposition into a convection current and a spin current, and that the spin
current vanishes in the Whitham approximation, which explains the negligible
effect of spin on wave packet solutions, independent of the size of Planck's
constant. We further discuss the classical-quantum correspondence in a curved
spacetime based on both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of the Whitham
equations. We show that the generalized de Broglie relations in a curved
spacetime are a direct consequence of Whitham's Lagrangian method, and not just
a physical hypothesis as introduced by Einstein and de Broglie, and by many
quantum mechanics textbooks.

planetesimal coagulation. Planetesimals of sizes up to a couple thousand kms
are embedded in these disks and their mutual collisions generate the small dust
grains that are observed. The dust luminosities, when combined with information
on the dust spatial extent and the system age, can be used to infer initial
masses in the planetesimal belts. Carrying out such a procedure for a sample of
debris disks around Sun-like stars, we reach the following two conclusions.
First, if we assume that colliding planetesimals satisfy a primordial size
spectrum of the form dn/ds ~ s^{-q}, observed disks strongly favor a value of q
between 3.5 and 4, while both current theoretical expectations and statistics
of Kuiper belt objects favor a somewhat larger value. Second, number densities
of planetesimals are two to three orders of magnitude higher in detected disks
than in the Kuiper belt, for comparably-sized objects. This is a surprise for
the coagulation models. It would require a similar increase in the solid
surface density of the primordial disk over that of the Minimum Mass Solar
Nebula, which is unreasonable. Both of our conclusions are driven by the need
to explain the presence of bright debris disks at a few Gyrs of age.

The H$\alpha$ profiles have a narrow component explained by direct excitations
and a thermally Doppler broadened component due to atoms that undergo charge
exchange in the post-shock region. However, the standard model does not take
into account the cosmic-ray shock precursor, which compresses and accelerates
plasma ahead of the shock. In strong precursors with sufficiently high
densities, the processes of charge exchange, excitation and ionization will
affect the widths of both narrow and broad line components. Moreover, the
difference in velocity between the neutrals and the precursor plasma gives rise
to frictional heating due to charge exchange and ionization in the precursor.
In extreme cases, all neutrals can be ionized by the precursor.
  In this paper we compute the ion and electron heating for a wide range of
shock parameters, along with the velocity distribution of the neutrals that
reach the shock. Our calculations predict very large narrow component widths
for some shocks with efficient acceleration, along with changes in the broad-
to-narrow intensity ratio used as a diagnostic for the electron-ion temperature
ratio. Balmer lines may therefore provide a unique diagnostic of precursor
properties. We show that heating by neutrals in the precursor can account for
the observed H$\alpha$ narrow component widths, and that the acceleration
efficiency is modest in most Balmer line shocks observed thus far.

nuclei (AGN) inside local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Our sample
consists of ten sources, harbouring AGN components with estimated luminosity in
excess of ~10^12 L_sun and yet unidentified at optical wavelengths because of
their large obscuration. According to the Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra, only
in two cases out of ten clear AGN signatures are detected at 2-10 keV in the
shape of reflected emission. The X-ray flux from the starburst (SB) components,
instead, is always broadly consistent with the expectations based on their IR
emission. The most convincing explanation for the missing AGN detections is
therefore the Compton-thickness of the X-ray absorber. In general, the
combination of our mid-IR and X-ray spectral analysis suggests that the
environment surrounding the AGN component in ULIRGs is much richer in gas and
dust than in ordinary active galaxies, and the degree of AGN absorption can be
tentatively related to the SB intensity, indicating a strong interaction
between the two processes and supporting the ULIRG/quasar evolutionary scheme.

microns has never been determined directly neither from observed luminosity
functions (LFs), over a wide redshift range, nor from any multiwavelength
observation of galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The evolving,
overall spectrum of the EBL is derived here utilizing a novel method based on
observations only. The changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forming
galaxies, starburst galaxies and active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies from
redshift 0.2 to 1 are estimated, and two alternative extrapolations of SED
types to higher redshifts are considered. This allows calculation of the
