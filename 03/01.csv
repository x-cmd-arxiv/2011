by two idealized power laws: one with steep slope for radii R>R* and one with
shallow slope for R<R*, where R*~25-50 km. Previous works suggested that the
SFD roll-over at R* can be the result of extensive collisional grinding in the
Kuiper belt that led to the catastrophic disruption of most bodies with R<R*.
Here we use a new code to test the effect of collisions in the Kuiper belt. We
find that the observed roll-over could indeed be explained by collisional
grinding provided that the initial mass in large bodies was much larger than
the one in the present Kuiper belt, and was dynamically depleted. In addition
to the size distribution changes, our code also tracks the effects of
collisions on binary systems. We find that it is generally easier to dissolve
wide binary systems, such as the ones existing in the cold Kuiper belt today,
than to catastrophically disrupt objects with R~R*. Thus, the binary survival
sets important limits on the extent of collisional grinding in the Kuiper belt.
We find that the extensive collisional grinding required to produce the SFD
roll-over at R* would imply a strong gradient of the binary fraction with R and
separation, because it is generally easier to dissolve binaries with small
components and/or those with wide orbits. The expected binary fraction for R<R*
is <0.1. The present observational data do not show such a gradient. Instead,
they suggest a large binary fraction of ~0.4 for R=30-40 km. This may indicate
that the roll-over was not produced by disruptive collisions, but is instead a
fossil remnant of the KBO formation process.

within patches of fixed size. We present, for smooth Gaussian random fields in
two and three dimensions, an analytical estimate of p_G which is expected to
hold in a regime where local maxima of the field are moderately high and weakly
clustered. When the patch size becomes sufficiently large, the negative of the
logarithm of the cumulative extreme value distribution is simply equal to the
average of the Euler Characteristic of the field in the excursion x > x_max
inside the patches. The Gumbel statistics therefore represents an interesting
alternative probe of the genus as a test of non Gaussianity, e.g. in cosmic
microwave background temperature maps or in three-dimensional galaxy catalogs.
It can be approximated, except in the remote positive tail, by a negative
Weibull type form, converging slowly to the expected Gumbel type form for
infinitely large patch size. Convergence is facilitated when large scale
correlations are weaker. We compare the analytic predictions to numerical
experiments for the case of a scale-free Gaussian field in two dimensions,
achieving impressive agreement between approximate theory and measurements. We
also discuss the generalization of our formalism to non-Gaussian fields.

study the question of whether the temperature is an intensive quantity, in the
sense that a block of a thermal state can be approximated by an effective
thermal state at the same temperature as the whole system. Using the quantum
fidelity as figure of merit, we identify instances in which this approximation
is not valid, as the block state and the reference thermal state are
distinguishable for refined measurements. Actually, there are situation in
which this distinguishability even increases with the block size. However, we
also show that the two states do become less distinguishable with the block
size for coarse-grained measurements--thus recovering the standard picture. We
then go further and construct an effective thermal state which provides a good
approximation of the block state for any observables and sizes. Finally, we
point out the role entanglement plays in this scenario by showing that, in
general, the thermodynamic paradigm of local intensive temperature applies
whenever entanglement is not present in the system.

exceed the four-body stop decay for certain parameter values. In the framework
of Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) this decay is CKM-suppressed, thus inducing
long stop lifetimes. Stop decay length measurements at the LHC can then be
exploited to test models with minimal flavour breaking through Standard Model
Yukawa couplings. The decay width has been given some time ago by an
approximate formula, which takes into account the leading logarithms of the MFV
scale. In this paper we calculate the exact one-loop decay width in the
framework of MFV. The comparison with the approximate result exhibits
deviations of the order of 10% for large MFV scales due to the neglected
non-logarithmic terms in the approximate decay formula. The difference in the
branching ratios is negligible. The large logarithms have to be resummed. The
resummation is performed by the solution of the renormalization group
equations. The comparison of the exact one-loop result and the tree level
flavour changing neutral current decay, which incorporates the resummed
logarithms, demonstrates that the resummation effects are important and should
be taken into account.

then used to construct the basic ingredients of the quantum inverse scattering

to a linear combination of explanatory variables. In this article, we propose a
covariance regression model that parameterizes the covariance matrix of a
multivariate response vector as a parsimonious quadratic function of
explanatory variables. The approach is analogous to the mean regression model,
and is similar to a factor analysis model in which the factor loadings depend
on the explanatory variables. Using a random-effects representation, parameter
estimation for the model is straightforward using either an EM-algorithm or an
MCMC approximation via Gibbs sampling. The proposed methodology provides a
simple but flexible representation of heteroscedasticity across the levels of
an explanatory variable, improves estimation of the mean function and gives
better calibrated prediction regions when compared to a homoscedastic model.

information on the physics of magnetic materials and lies at the heart of a
variety of signal processing microwave devices. Here we demonstrate
theoretically that substrate-induced lattice strains may change the FMR
frequency of an epitaxial ferromagnetic film dramatically, leading to ultralow
and ultrahigh resonance frequencies at room temperature. Remarkably, the FMR
frequency varies with the epitaxial strain nonmonotonically, reaching minimum
at a critical strain corresponding to the strain-induced spin reorientation
transition. Furthermore, by coupling the ferromagnetic film to a ferroelectric
substrate, it becomes possible to achieve an efficient voltage control of FMR
parameters. In contrast to previous studies, we found that the tunability of
FMR frequency varies with the applied electric field and strongly increases at
critical field intensity. The revealed features open up wide opportunities for
the development of advanced tunable magnetoelectric devices based on strained
nanomagnets.

  IEEE",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When two or more users in a wireless network transmit simultaneously, their
electromagnetic signals are linearly superimposed on the channel. As a result,
a receiver that is interested in one of these signals sees the others as
unwanted interference. This property of the wireless medium is typically viewed
as a hindrance to reliable communication over a network. However, using a
recently developed coding strategy, interference can in fact be harnessed for
network coding. In a wired network, (linear) network coding refers to each
intermediate node taking its received packets, computing a linear combination
over a finite field, and forwarding the outcome towards the destinations. Then,
given an appropriate set of linear combinations, a destination can solve for
its desired packets. For certain topologies, this strategy can attain
significantly higher throughputs over routing-based strategies. Reliable
physical layer network coding takes this idea one step further: using
judiciously chosen linear error-correcting codes, intermediate nodes in a
wireless network can directly recover linear combinations of the packets from
the observed noisy superpositions of transmitted signals. Starting with some
simple examples, this survey explores the core ideas behind this new technique
and the possibilities it offers for communication over interference-limited
wireless networks.

contexts: words that are left or right of the NE. The work mainly aims at
identifying contexts inducing the NE's nature. As such, The occurrence of the
word ""President"" in a text, means that this word or context may be followed by
the name of a president as President ""Obama"". Likewise, a word preceded by the

recognition may be viewed as a classification method, where every word is
assigned to a NE class, regarding the context. The aim of this study is then to
identify and classify the contexts that are most relevant to recognize a NE,
those which are frequently found with the NE. A learning approach using
training corpus: web documents, constructed from learning examples is then
suggested. Frequency representations and modified tf-idf representations are
used to calculate the context weights associated to context frequency, learning
example frequency, and document frequency in the corpus.

$B$-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background to allow for deep
searches of primordial $B$-modes. However, the delensing algorithm existing in
the literature breaks down if the target $B$-mode signals overlap significantly
with the lensing $B$-mode ($\sim 300<l<2000$) in multipole-$l$ space. In this
paper, we identify the cause of the breakdown to be correlations between the
input $B$-map and the deflection field estimator ($EB$). The amplitude of this
bias is quantified by numerical simulations and compared to the analytically
derived functional form. We also propose a revised delensing procedure that
circumvents the bias. While the newly identified bias does not affect the
search of degree scale $B$-mode generated by tensor perturbations, the modified
delensing algorithm makes it possible to perform deep searches of high-$l$
$B$-modes such as those generated by patchy reionization, cosmic strings, or
rotation of polarization angles. Finally, we estimate how well future
polarization experiments can do in detecting tensor- and cosmic string-
generated $B$-mode after delensing and comment on different survey strategies.

cosmological simulations (""virial"" mass, FoF mass, $M_{50,100,200,...}$) only
capture part of the collapsed material and are therefore inconsistent with the
halo mass concept used in analytical treatments of structure formation.
Simulations have demonstrated that typical dark matter particle orbits extend
out to about 90 per cent of their turnaround radius, which results in apocenter
passages outside of the current ""virial"" radius on the first and also on the
second orbit. Here we describe how the formation history of haloes can be used
to identify those particles which took part in the halo collapse, but are
missed by conventional group-finders because of their remote present location.
These particles are added to the part of the halo already identified by FoF.
The corrected masses of dark haloes are significantly higher (the median mass
increase is 25 per cent) and there is a considerable shift of the halo mass
function towards the Press & Schechter form. We conclude that meaningful
quantitative comparisons between (semi-)analytic predictions of halo properties
(e.g. mass functions, mass accretion rates, merger rates, spatial clustering,
etc.) and simulation results will require using the same halo definition in
both approaches.

revolutionized the understanding of nucleon structure by revealing the strong
decrease of $R$ with momentum transfer $Q^2$ for $Q^2 \gtrsim 1$ GeV$^2$, in
strong disagreement with previous extractions of $R$ from cross section
measurements. In particular, the polarization transfer results have exposed the
limits of applicability of the one-photon-exchange approximation and
highlighted the role of quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon
structure. The GEp-II experiment in Jefferson Lab's Hall A measured $R$ at four
$Q^2$ values in the range 3.5 GeV$^2 \le Q^2 \le 5.6$ GeV$^2$. A possible
discrepancy between the originally published GEp-II results and more recent

final analysis is a systematic increase in the results for $R$, improving the
consistency of the polarization transfer data in the high-$Q^2$ region. This
increase is the result of an improved selection of elastic events which largely
removes the systematic effect of the inelastic contamination, underestimated by

experiments is very sensitive to the temperature and possibly can be used in

resolutions. To do this, we first present a new conjectural method of obtaining
conventional resolutions using coordinate rings of matrix-valued functions. We
verify this conjecture for all cyclic quotient surface singularities, the
Kleinian D_n and E_6 surface singularities, the conifold singularity, and a
non-isolated singularity, using appropriate quiver algebras. This conjecture
provides a possible new generalization of the classical McKay correspondence.
Then, using symplectic reduction within these rings, we obtain new,
non-conventional resolutions that are hidden if only commutative functions are
considered. Geometrically, these non-conventional resolutions result from
shrinking exceptional loci to ramified (non-Azumaya) point-like spheres.

plasma is heated in the accretion shock, or if it is coronal plasma
fed/modified by the accretion process. We conducted a coordinated
quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray observing campaign of the CTTS V2129 Oph
(Chandra/HETGS data to constrain the X-ray emitting plasma components, and
optical observations to constrain the characteristics of accretion and magnetic
field). We analyze a 200 ks Chandra/HETGS observation of V2129 Oph, subdivided
into two 100 ks segments, corresponding to two different phases within one
stellar rotation. The X-ray emitting plasma covers a wide range of
temperatures: 2-34 MK. The cool plasma component of V2129 Oph varies between
the two segments of the Chandra observation: high density plasma (log Ne ~
12.1) with high EM at ~ 3-4 MK is present during the 1st segment; during the
2nd segment this plasma component has lower EM and lower density (log Ne <
11.5), although the statistical significance of these differences is marginal.
Hotter plasma components, T > 10 MK, show variability on short time scales (~
10 ks), typical of coronal plasma. A clear flare, detected in the 1st segment,
could be located in a large coronal loop (> 3 Rstar). Our observation provides
further confirmation that the dense cool plasma at a few MK in CTTS is material
heated in the accretion shock. The variability of this cool plasma component on
V2129 Oph may be explained in terms of X-rays emitted in the accretion shock
and seen with different viewing angles at the two rotational phases probed by
our observation. During the 1st time interval direct view of the shock region
is possible, while, during the 2nd, the accretion funnel itself intersects the
line of sight to the shock region, preventing us from observing
accretion-driven X-rays.

nanosecond pulses of Cherenkov emission which are produced during UHE cosmic

Earth-based telescopes dispersed, and therefore reduced in amplitude, due to
their propagation through the Earth's ionosphere. To maximise the received
signal to noise ratio and subsequent chances of pulse detection, ionospheric
dispersion must therefore be corrected, and since the high time resolution
would require excessive data storage this correction must be made in real time.
This requires an accurate knowledge of the dispersion characteristic which is
parameterised by the instantaneous Total Electron Content (TEC) of the
ionosphere. A new method to calibrate the dispersive effect of the ionosphere
on lunar Cherenkov pulses has been developed for the LUNASKA lunar Cherenkov
experiments. This method exploits radial symmetries in the distribution of the
Moon's polarised emission to make Faraday rotation measurements in the
visibility domain of synthesis array data (i. e. instantaneously). Faraday
rotation measurements are then combined with geomagnetic field models to
estimate the ionospheric TEC. This method of ionospheric calibration is
particularly attractive for the lunar Cherenkov technique as it may be used in
real time to estimate the ionospheric TEC along a line-of-sight to the Moon and

also evaluate a key frequency shift, $\triangle\omega$, produced by the

ground eigenstate. In principle, such weak entanglement can be sufficient for
operation of logic gates, provided the resolution is high enough to detect the

accretion rates of baryons into dark matter halos and the resulting baryon mass
fractions, as a function of halo mass, redshift, and baryon type (including
cold and hot gas). We find that the net baryonic accretion rates through the
virial radius are sensitive to galactic outflows and explore a range of outflow
parameters to illustrate the effects. We show that the cold gas accretion rate
is in general not a simple universal factor of the dark matter accretion rate,
and that galactic winds can cause star formation rates to deviate significantly
from the external gas accretion rates, both via gas ejection and re-accretion.
Furthermore, galactic winds can inject enough energy and momentum in the
surrounding medium to slow down accretion altogether, especially in low-mass
halos and at low redshift. By resolving the accretion rates versus radius from
the halo centers, we show how cold streams penetrate the hot atmospheres of
massive halos at z>2, but gradually disappear at lower redshift. The total
baryon mass fraction is also strongly suppressed by outflows in low-mass halos,
but is nearly universal in the absence of feedback in halos above the UV
background suppression scale. The transition halo mass, at which the gas mass
in halos is equal for the cold and hot components, is roughly constant at
~10^11.5 Msun and does not depend sensitively on the wind prescription. We
provide simple fitting formulae for the cold gas accretion rate into halos in
the no-wind case. Finally, we show that cold accretion is broadly consistent
with driving the bulk of the highly star-forming galaxies observed at z~2, but
that the more intense star formers likely sample the high end of the accretion
rate distribution, and may be additionally fueled by a combination of gas
recycling, gas re-accretion, hot mode cooling, and mergers.

which is routinely used to identify dark matter halos from N-body simulations.
We use results from percolation theory to show that the boundary of FOF halos
does not correspond to a single density threshold but to a range of densities
close to a critical value that depends upon the linking length parameter, b. We
show that for the commonly used choice of b = 0.2, this critical density is
equal to 81.62 times the mean matter density. Consequently, halos identified by
the FOF algorithm enclose an average overdensity which depends on their density
profile (concentration) and therefore changes with halo mass contrary to the
popular belief that the average overdensity is ~180. We derive an analytical
expression for the overdensity as a function of the linking length parameter b
and the concentration of the halo. Results of tests carried out using simulated
and actual FOF halos identified in cosmological simulations show excellent
agreement with our analytical prediction. We also find that the mass of the
halo that the FOF algorithm selects crucially depends upon mass resolution. We
find a percolation theory motivated formula that is able to accurately correct
for the dependence on number of particles for the mock realizations of
spherical and triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halos. However, we show that this
correction breaks down when applied to the real cosmological FOF halos due to
presence of substructures. Given that abundance of substructure depends on
redshift and cosmology, we expect that the resolution effects due to
substructure on the FOF mass and halo mass function will also depend on
redshift and cosmology and will be difficult to correct for in general.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the universality of the

five of the exoplanetary systems studied by the EPOCh (Extrasolar Planet
Observation and Characterization) component of the NASA EPOXI mission: HAT-P-4,
TrES-3, TrES-2, WASP-3, and HAT-P-7. We conduct a search of the high-precision
time series for photometric transits of additional planets. We find no
candidate transits with significance higher than our detection limit. From
Monte Carlo tests of the time series using putative periods from 0.5 days to 7
days, we demonstrate the sensitivity to detect Neptune-sized companions around
TrES-2, sub-Saturn-sized companions in the HAT-P-4, TrES-3, and WASP-3 systems,
and Saturn-sized companions around HAT-P-7. We investigate in particular our
sensitivity to additional transits in the dynamically favorable 3:2 and 2:1
exterior resonances with the known exoplanets: if we assume coplanar orbits
with the known planets, then companions in these resonances with HAT-P-4b,
WASP-3b, and HAT-P-7b would be expected to transit, and we can set lower limits
on the radii of companions in these systems. In the nearly grazing exoplanetary
systems TrES-3 and TrES-2, additional coplanar planets in these resonances are
not expected to transit. However, we place lower limits on the radii of
companions that would transit if the orbits were misaligned by 2.0 degrees and
1.4 degrees for TrES-3 and TrES-2, respectively.

intense levels of energetic radiations, X-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV).
Depending on the masses and densities of the planets and on the atmospheric
heating efficiencies, the stellar energetic inputs can lead to atmospheric mass
loss. These evaporation processes are observable in the ultraviolet during
planetary transits. The aim of the present work is to quantify the mass-loss
rates (dm/dt), heating efficiencies (eta), and lifetimes for the whole sample
of transiting exoplanets, now including hot jupiters, hot neptunes, and hot
super-earths. The mass-loss rates and lifetimes are estimated from an ""energy
diagram"" for exoplanets, which compares the planet gravitational potential
energy to the stellar X/EUV energy deposited in the atmosphere. We estimate the
mass-loss rates of all detected transiting planets to be within 10^6 to 10^13
g/s for various conservative assumptions. High heating efficiencies would imply
that hot exoplanets such the gas giants WASP-12b and WASP-17b could be
completely evaporated within 1 Gyr. We further show that the heating efficiency
can be constrained when dm/dt is inferred from observations and the stellar
X/EUV luminosity is known. This leads us to suggest that eta ~ 100% in the
atmosphere of the hot jupiter HD209458b, while it could be lower for HD189733b.
Simultaneous observations of transits in the ultraviolet and X-rays are
necessary to further constrain the exospheric properties of exoplanets.

atmospheres suggest a slightly higher temperature and surface gravity than the

binary found to date. Its secondary component has an absolute H-band magnitude
that is 1.9+/-0.3 mag fainter than UGPS J0722-05, giving an inferred spectral
type of >T10. The secondary's bolometric luminosity of ~2 x 10^{-7} L_sun makes
it the least luminous known brown dwarf by a factor of 4-5. By comparing to
evolutionary models and T9-T10 objects, we estimate a temperature of 370+/-40 K
and a mass of 6-15 Mjup for CFBDS J1458+10B. At such extremes, atmospheric
models predict the onset of novel photospheric processes, namely the appearance
of water clouds and the removal of strong alkali lines, but their impact on the
emergent spectrum is highly uncertain. Our photometry shows that strong CH4
absorption persists at H-band; the J-K color is bluer than the latest known T
dwarfs but not as blue as predicted by current models; and the J-H color
delineates a possible inflection in the blueward trend for the latest T dwarfs.
Given its low luminosity, atypical colors and cold temperature, CFBDS J1458+10B

Diagrams can be used to constrain the ages of different stellar populations,
and also their spatial distribution. The Sculptor dSph contains a predominantly
ancient stellar population (>10 Gyr old) which can be easily resolved into
individual stars. A galaxy dominated by an old population provides a clear view
of ancient processes of galaxy formation unimpeded by overlying younger
populations. By using spectroscopic metallicities of RGB stars in combination
with our deep Main Sequence Turn-Off photometry we can constrain the ages of
different stellar populations with particular accuracy. We find that the known
metallicity gradient in Sculptor is well matched to an age gradient. This is
the first time that this link with age has been directly quantified. This
gradient has been previously observed as a variation in Horizontal Branch
properties and is now confirmed to exist for Main Sequence Turn-Offs as well.
It is likely the Sculptor dSph first formed an extended metal-poor population
at the oldest times, and subsequent more metal-rich, younger stars were formed
more towards the centre until the gas was depleted or lost roughly 7 Gyr ago.
The fact that these clear radial gradients have been preserved up to the
present day is consistent with the apparent lack of signs of recent tidal

of the relevant physics in the LambdaCDM cosmogony, particularly a
self-consistent calculation of reionization by UV photons emitted by the
forming galaxy population, including the progenitors of the central galaxy.
Along the merger tree of each halo, the model calculates gas cooling (by
Compton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons, molecular hydrogen
and atomic processes), gas heating (from hydrogen photoionization and supernova
energy), star formation and evolution. The evolution of the intergalactic
medium is followed simultaneously with that of the galaxies. Star formation in
the more massive progenitor subhalos is suppressed primarily by supernova
feedback, while for smaller subhalos it is suppressed primarily by
photoionization due to external and internal sources. The model is constrained
to match a wide range of properties of the present day galaxy population as a
whole, but at high redshift it requires an escape fraction of UV photons near
unity in order completely to reionize the universe by redshift z ~ 8. In the

free energy and triggering solar eruptions, but also has been observed to
change rapidly and permanently responding to the coronal magnetic field
restructuring due to coronal transients. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
instrument (HMI) on board the newly launched Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
produces seeing-free full-disk vector magnetograms at consistently high
resolution and high cadence, which finally makes possible an unambiguous and
comprehensive study of this important back-reaction process. In this study, we
present a near disk-center, GOES-class X2.2 flare occurred at NOAA AR 11158 on
2011 February 15 using the magnetic field measurements made by HMI. We obtained
the first solid evidence of an enhancement in the transverse magnetic field at
the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) by a magnitude of 70%. This
rapid and irreversible field evolution is unequivocally associated with the
flare occurrence, with the enhancement area located in between the two
chromospheric flare ribbons. Similar findings have been made for another two
major flare events observed by SDO. These results strongly corroborate our
previous suggestion that the photospheric magnetic field near the PIL must
become more horizontal after eruptions.
  In-depth studies will follow to further link the photospheric magnetic field
changes with the dynamics of coronal mass ejections, when full Stokes inversion
is carried out to generate accurate magnetic field vectors.

Lyman-alpha (DLA) absorbers are compared with those of extremely metal-poor
stars in the Galactic halo, as well as extragalactic H II regions, to decipher
nucleosynthesis and chemical enrichment in the early Universe. These
comparisons surprisingly identify a relatively high C/O ratio and a low N/O
ratio in DLA systems, which is hard to explain theoretically. We propose that
if these features are confirmed by future studies, this effect occurs because
the initial mass function in metal-poor DLA systems has a cut-off at the upper
mass end at around 20-25 Msun, thus lacks the massive stars that provide the
nucleosynthesis products leading to the low C/O and high N/O ratios. This
finding is a reasonable explanation of the nature of DLA systems in which a
sufficient amount of cold H I gas remains intact because of the suppression of
ionization by massive stars. In addition, our claim strongly supports a high
production rate of N in very massive stars, which might be acceptable in light
of the recent nucleosynthesis calculations with fast rotation models. The
updates of both abundance data and nucleosynthesis results will strengthen our
novel proposition that the C/O and N/O abundances are a powerful tool for
inferring the form of the initial mass function.

the quasiperiodic wavefunctions defined on R^n play the role of sections of the
associated hermitean line bundle E on T^n, since also E admits a global
description as a quotient. The components of the covariant derivatives
corresponding to a constant (necessarily integral) magnetic field B = dA
generate a Lie algebra g_Q and together with the periodic functions the algebra
of observables O_Q . The non-abelian part of g_Q is a Heisenberg Lie algebra
with the electric charge operator Q as the central generator; the corresponding
Lie group G_Q acts on the Hilbert space as the translation group up to phase
factors. Also the space of sections of E is mapped into itself by g in G_Q . We
identify the socalled magnetic translation group as a subgroup of the
observables' group Y_Q . We determine the unitary irreducible representations
of O_Q, Y_Q corresponding to integer charges and for each of them an associated
orthonormal basis explicitly in configuration space. We also clarify how in the

from hot-Jupiters at near-Infrared wavelengths using ground-based telescopes,

understanding of its energy budget. Aims: The aim of the reported work is to
measure the eclipse depth of the planet HAT-P-1b at 2.2micron. This planet is
an interesting case, since the amount of stellar irradiation it receives falls
in between that of the two best studied systems (HD209458 and HD189733), and it
has been suggested to have a weak thermal inversion layer. Methods: We have
used the LIRIS instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) to observe
the secondary eclipse of HATP-1b in the Ks-band, as part of our Ground-based
secondary eclipse (GROUSE) project. The observations were done in staring mode,
while significantly defocusing the telescope to avoid saturation on the K=8.4
star. With an average cadence of 2.5 seconds, we collected 6520 frames during
one night. Results: The eclipse is detected at the 4sigma level, the measured
depth being 0.109+/-0.025%. The uncertainties are dominated by residual
systematic effects, as estimated from different reduction/analysis procedures.
The measured depth corresponds to a brightness temperature of 2136+150-170K.
This brightness temperature is significantly higher than those derived from
longer wavelengths, making it difficult to fit all available data points with a
plausible atmospheric model. However, it may be that we underestimate the true
uncertainties of our measurements, since it is notoriously difficult to assign
precise statistical significance to a result when systematic effects are
important.

Gaussian coding and successive decoding. In the deterministic channel problem,
we find the constrained sum-capacity and its achievable schemes with the
minimum number of messages, first in symmetric channels, and then in general
asymmetric channels. We show that the constrained sum-capacity oscillates as a
function of the cross link gain parameters between the information theoretic
sum-capacity and the sum-capacity with interference treated as noise.
Furthermore, we show that if the number of messages of either of the two users
is fewer than the minimum number required to achieve the constrained
sum-capacity, the maximum achievable sum-rate drops to that with interference
treated as noise. We provide two algorithms (a simple one and a finer one) to
translate the optimal schemes in the deterministic channel model to the
Gaussian channel model. We also derive two upper bounds on the sum-capacity of
the Gaussian Han-Kobayashi schemes, which automatically upper bound the
sum-capacity using successive decoding of Gaussian codewords. Numerical
evaluations show that, similar to the deterministic channel results, the
constrained sum-capacity in the Gaussian channels oscillates between the
sum-capacity with Han-Kobayashi schemes and that with single message schemes.

gravitational lenses stronger than expected. We use clusters extracted from the

distributions of lensing cross sections, Einstein rings, and concentrations for
the sample of 12 MACS clusters at $z>0.5$ presented in Ebeling et al. (2007)
and discussed in Zitrin et al. (2010). We find that simulated clusters produce
$\sim 50%$ less arcs than observed clusters do. The medians of the
distributions of the Einstein ring sizes differ by $\sim 25%$ between
simulations and observations. We estimate that, due to cluster triaxiality and
orientation biases affecting the lenses with the largest cross sections, the
concentrations of the individual MACS clusters inferred from the lensing
analysis should be up to a factor of $\sim 2$ larger than expected from the
$\Lambda$CDM model. The arc statistics, the Einstein ring, and the
concentration problems in strong lensing clusters are mitigated but not solved
on the basis of our analysis. Nevertheless, due to the lack of redshifts for
most of the multiple image systems used for modeling the MACS clusters, the
results of this work will need to be verified with additional data. The

QoS guarantees it provides to its customers, and the satisfaction of the
advertised guarantees. In this paper, we devise and analyze three
inter-organizational economic models relevant to cloud networks. We formulate
our problems as non co-operative price and QoS games between multiple cloud
providers existing in a cloud market. We prove that a unique pure strategy Nash
equilibrium (NE) exists in two of the three models. Our analysis paves the path
for each cloud provider to 1) know what prices and QoS level to set for
end-users of a given service type, such that the provider could exist in the
cloud market, and 2) practically and dynamically provision appropriate capacity
for satisfying advertised QoS guarantees.

magnetic order at low temperature. Here we present a comprehensive
single-crystal neutron scattering study of CoAl2O4, a highly frustrated A-site

dramatic change in the elastic scattering lineshape accompanied by the

that T* signifies a first-order phase transition, but with true long-range

plasma travels at the velocity of the molecular beam, and, on passing through a
grounded grid, yields an electron time-of-flight signal that gauges the plasma
size and quantity of trapped electrons. This plasma expands at a rate that fits
with an electron temperature as low as 5 K, colder that typically observed for

created with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1 - 3
Myr ago, which was active for a duration of ~ 0.1 - 0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets
were ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near
the GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001
<~ \eta <~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically
dominated by kinetic energy, and over-pressured with either CR or thermal
pressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as
observed. The sharp edges of the bubbles imply that CR diffusion across the
bubble surface is strongly suppressed. The jet activity induces a strong shock,
which heats and compresses the ambient gas in the Galactic halo, potentially
explaining the ROSAT X-ray shell features surrounding the bubbles. The Fermi
bubbles provide plausible evidence for a recent powerful AGN jet activity in
our Galaxy, shedding new insights into the origin of the halo CR population and
the channel through which massive black holes in disk galaxies release feedback

boundary condition contains extrapolation length $\Lambda$ with nonzero
imaginary part $\Lambda_i$. As a result of this complexity, the
self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian is lost, its eigenvalues $E$ become complex
too and the discrete bound states of the disk characteristic for the real
$\Lambda$ turn into the corresponding quasibound states with their lifetime
defined by the eigenenergies imaginary parts $E_i$. Accordingly, the
longitudinal flux undergoes an alteration as it flows along the wire with its
attenuation/amplification being $E_i$-dependent too. It is shown that, for zero
magnetic field, the component $E_i$ as a function of the Robin imaginary part
exhibits a pronounced sharp extremum with its magnitude being the largest for
the zero real part $\Lambda_r$ of the extrapolation length. Increasing
magnitude of $\Lambda_r$ quenches the $E_i-\Lambda_i$ resonance and at very
large $\Lambda_r$ the eigenenergies $E$ approach the asymptotic real values
independent of $\Lambda_i$. The extremum is also wiped out by the magnetic
field when, for the large $B$, the energies tend to the Landau levels.
Mathematical and physical interpretations of the obtained results are provided;
in particular, it is shown that the finite lifetime of the disk quasibound
states stems from the $\Lambda_i$-induced currents flowing through the sample
boundary. Possible experimental tests of the calculated effect are discussed;
namely, it is argued that it can be observed in superconductors by applying to
them the external electric field $\cal E$ normal to the surface.

attribute the observed variability to one physical origin (e.g. central engine

invoke two physically distinct variability components. We develop a method,
namely, the stepwise filter correlation (SFC) method, to decompose the
variability components in a GRB lightcurve. Based on a low-pass filter
technique, we progressively filter the high frequency signals from the
lightcurve, and then perform a correlation analysis between each adjunct pair
of filtered lightcurves. Our simulations suggest that if a mock lightcurve
contains a slow variability component superposed on a rapidly varying time
sequence, the correlation coefficient as a function of the filter frequency
would display a prominent dip feature around the frequency of the slow
component. Through simulations, we demonstrate that this method can identify
significant clustering structures of a lightcurve in the frequency domain, and
proved that it can catch superposed signals that are otherwise not easy to
retrieve based on other methods (e.g. the power density spectrum analysis
method). We apply this method to 266 BATSE bright GRBs. We find that the
majority of the bursts have clear evidence of such a superposition effect. We
perform a statistical analysis of the identified variability components, and

traditional approach to reason about the trustworthiness of a transaction is to
determine the trustworthiness of the specific agent involved, derived from the

propose a generic, machine learning approach based trust framework where an
agent uses its own previous transactions (with other agents) to build a
knowledge base, and utilize this to assess the trustworthiness of a transaction
based on associated features, which are capable of distinguishing successful
transactions from unsuccessful ones. These features are harnessed using
appropriate machine learning algorithms to extract relationships between the

using a Jordan-Wigner transformation, which transforms the spins into

size of the bubbles is determined by the radius of the inner gas jet and the
bubble formation frequency. We obtain the radius of the gas jet by solving the
Navier-Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flows and by minimization of
the dissipation energy. The prediction of the bubble size is based on the
system's control parameters only, i.e. the inner gas flow rate $Q_i$, the outer
liquid flow rate $Q_o$, and the tube radius $R$. For a very low gas-to-liquid
flow rate ratio ($Q_i / Q_o \rightarrow 0$) the bubble radius scales as $r_b /
R \propto \sqrt{Q_i / Q_o}$, independently of the inner to outer viscosity
ratio $\eta_i/\eta_o$ and of the type of the velocity profile in the gas, which
can be either flat or parabolic, depending on whether high-molecular-weight
surfactants cover the gas-liquid interface or not. However, in the case in
which the gas velocity profiles are parabolic and the viscosity ratio is
sufficiently low, i.e. $\eta_i/\eta_o \ll 1$, the bubble diameter scales as
$r_b \propto (Q_i/Q_o)^\beta$, with $\beta$ smaller than 1/2.

correlation between the bolometric and X-ray luminosities. In the framework of
the Chandra Carina Complex Project, 129 O and B stars have been detected as
X-ray sources; 78 of those, all with spectral type earlier than B3, have enough
counts for at least a rough X-ray spectral characterization. This leads to an
estimate of the Lx/Lbol ratio for an exceptional number of 60 O stars belonging
to the same region and triples the number of Carina massive stars studied
spectroscopically in X-rays. The derived log(Lx/Lbol) is -7.26 for single
objects, with a dispersion of only 0.21dex. Using the properties of hot massive
stars listed in the literature, we compare the X-ray luminosities of different
types of objects. In the case of O stars, the Lx/Lbol ratios are similar for
bright and faint objects, as well as for stars of different luminosity classes
or spectral types. Binaries appear only slightly harder and slightly more
luminous in X-rays than single objects; the differences are not formally
significant (at the 1% level), except for the Lx/Lbol ratio in the medium
(1.0--2.5keV) energy band. Weak-wind objects have similar X-ray luminosities
but they display slightly softer spectra compared to ""normal"" O stars with the
same bolometric luminosity. Discarding three overluminous objects, we find a
very shallow trend of harder emission in brighter objects. The properties of
the few B stars bright enough to yield some spectral information appear to be
different overall (constant X-ray luminosities, harder spectra), hinting that
another mechanism for producing X-rays, besides wind shocks, might be at work.
However, it must be stressed that the earliest and X-ray brightest amongst
these few detected objects are similar to the latest O stars, suggesting a
possibly smooth transition between the two processes.

Existing works indicate that exploring correlations between labels improve the
prediction performance. However, embedding the label correlations into the
training process significantly increases the problem size. Moreover, the
mapping of the label structure in the feature space is not clear. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-label learning method ""Structured Decomposition
+ Group Sparsity (SDGS)"". In SDGS, we learn a feature subspace for each label
from the structured decomposition of the training data, and predict the labels
of a new sample from its group sparse representation on the multi-subspace
obtained from the structured decomposition. In particular, in the training
stage, we decompose the data matrix $X\in R^{n\times p}$ as
$X=\sum_{i=1}^kL^i+S$, wherein the rows of $L^i$ associated with samples that
belong to label $i$ are nonzero and consist a low-rank matrix, while the other
rows are all-zeros, the residual $S$ is a sparse matrix. The row space of $L_i$
is the feature subspace corresponding to label $i$. This decomposition can be
efficiently obtained via randomized optimization. In the prediction stage, we
estimate the group sparse representation of a new sample on the multi-subspace
via group \emph{lasso}. The nonzero representation coefficients tend to
concentrate on the subspaces of labels that the sample belongs to, and thus an
effective prediction can be obtained. We evaluate SDGS on several real datasets
and compare it with popular methods. Results verify the effectiveness and
efficiency of SDGS.

from the combinatorial scientific community, leading to novel models and
algorithms, their applications, and development of associated tools.
Hypergraphs are now a standard tool in combinatorial scientific computing. The
modeling flexibility of hypergraphs however, comes at a cost: algorithms on
hypergraphs are inherently more complicated than those on graphs, which
sometimes translate to nontrivial increases in processing times. Neither the
modeling flexibility of hypergraphs, nor the runtime efficiency of graph
algorithms can be overlooked. Therefore, the new research thrust should be how
to cleverly trade-off between the two. This work addresses one method for this
trade-off by solving the hypergraph partitioning problem by finding vertex
separators on graphs. Specifically, we investigate how to solve the hypergraph
partitioning problem by seeking a vertex separator on its net intersection
graph (NIG), where each net of the hypergraph is represented by a vertex, and
two vertices share an edge if their nets have a common vertex. We propose a
vertex-weighting scheme to attain good node-balanced hypergraphs, since NIG
model cannot preserve node balancing information. Vertex-removal and
vertex-splitting techniques are described to optimize cutnet and connectivity
metrics, respectively, under the recursive bipartitioning paradigm. We also
developed an implementation for our GPVS-based HP formulations by adopting and
modifying a state-of-the-art GPVS tool onmetis. Experiments conducted on a
large collection of sparse matrices confirmed the validity of our proposed
techniques.

  We investigate the potential of detecting the gravitational wave from
individual binary black hole systems using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and
calculate the accuracy for determining the GW properties. This is done in a
consistent analysis, which at the same time accounts for the measurement of the
pulsar distances via the timing parallax.
  We find that, at low redshift, a PTA is able to detect the nano-Hertz GW from
super massive black hole binary systems with masses of $\sim10^8 -
10^{10}\,M_{\sun}$ less than $\sim10^5$\,years before the final merger, and
those with less than $\sim10^3 - 10^4$ years before merger may allow us to
detect the evolution of binaries.
  We derive an analytical expression to describe the accuracy of a pulsar
distance measurement via timing parallax. We consider five years of bi-weekly
observations at a precision of 15\,ns for close-by ($\sim 0.5 - 1$\,kpc)
pulsars. Timing twenty pulsars would allow us to detect a GW source with an
amplitude larger than $5\times 10^{-17}$. We calculate the corresponding GW and
binary orbital parameters and their measurement precision. The accuracy of
measuring the binary orbital inclination angle, the sky position, and the GW
frequency are calculated as functions of the GW amplitude. We note that the
""pulsar term"", which is commonly regarded as noise, is essential for obtaining
an accurate measurement for the GW source location.
  We also show that utilizing the information encoded in the GW signal passing
the Earth also increases the accuracy of pulsar distance measurements. If the
gravitational wave is strong enough, one can achieve sub-parsec distance
measurements for nearby pulsars with distance less than $\sim 0.5 - 1$\,kpc.

to prove there are no consistent hidden-variable theories in which ""particle""

morphing behaviour between ""particle"" and ""wave""; this further supports the
conclusion that ""particle"" and ""wave"" are not realistic properties but merely

to be connected to a bus in order to maintain stability before the system
reaches its bifurcation point. Line Flow index (LF index) along with voltage

This relieves us from the need of decoding the randomisation parameter which is
in general not possible within this model. Moreover we prove a lower bound on
the secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel without channel state
information.

surface have strengths of the order of or lower than the equipartition field
(300-500 G). This results in a myriad of magnetic fields whose evolution is
largely determined by the turbulent plasma motions. When granules evolve they
squash the magnetic field lines together or pull them apart. Here we report on
the periodic deformation of the shapes of features in circular polarization
observed at high resolution with Sunrise. In particular, we note that the area
of patches with constant magnetic flux oscillates with time, which implies that
the apparent magnetic field intensity oscillates in antiphase. The periods
associated to this oscillatory pattern is compatible with the granular
life-time and change abruptly, which suggests that these oscillations might not
correspond to characteristic oscillatory modes of magnetic structures, but to
the forcing by granular motions. In one particular case, we find three patches
around the same granule oscillating in phase, which means that the spatial
coherence of these oscillations can reach 1600 km. Interestingly, the same kind
of oscillatory phenomenon is found also in the upper photosphere.

binary has complicated circumbinary features, including a circumbinary disk,
western and eastern arm-like structures, and two cavities at the northeast and
southwest. The circumbinary disk is 630 AU in radius and the southeast side of
the disk is bright in the H-band. The brightness ratio (southeast/northwest) is
1.6. A single Rayleigh-like scattering model indicates that the disk is
inclined by 30 degree to 40 degree and that the southeast side corresponds to
the near side along our line of sight. The H-band surface brightness of the
southeast side decreases as r^(-1.9) from 15.2 mag arcsec^-2 to 16.8 mag
arcsec^-2. The outer portion of the disk is possibly more flared than its inner
portion. The weak centro-symmetric polarization pattern and redder F606W-H
color (4.2 mag) of the southeast side are probably caused by multiple
scattering events from the dust grains associated with the binary. The
F606W-band image shows the bright northwest side of the disk in contrast with
the H-band image. The F606W-H color of the northwest side is between 1.7 mag

neutral scattered light from the northwest side. This idea is supported by the
polarization pattern of the northwest side, which is centro-symmetric with
respect to Haro 6-5 B. The arms appear to encompass the western and eastern
cavities, suggesting that the arms + cavity systems are created by a bipolar
outflow from the binary. However, the direction of this outflow is inconsistent

basic properties of the Lorentz group. The generators for rotations and boosts
along an arbitrary direction, as well as their commutation relations, are
written as functions of the unit vectors that define the axis of rotation or
the direction of the boost (an approach that can be compared with the one that
in electrodynamics, works with the electric and magnetic fields instead of the
Maxwell stress tensor). For finite values of the angle of rotation or the
boost's velocity, collectively denoted by V, the existence of an exponential
expansion for the coordinate transformation's matrix, M (in terms of GV where G
is the generator) requires that the matrix's derivative with respect to V, be
equal to GM. This condition can only be satisfied if the transformation is
additive as it is indeed the case for rotations, but not for velocities. If it
is assumed, however, that for boosts such an expansion exists, with V = V(v), v
being the velocity, and if the above condition is imposed on the boost's matrix
then its expression in terms of hyperbolic cosh(V) and sinh(V} is recovered,
and the expression for V(= arc tanh(v)) is determined. A general Lorentz
transformation can be written as an exponential containing the sum of a
rotation and a boost, which to first order is equal to the product of a boost
with a rotation. The calculations of the second and third order terms show that
the equations for the generators used in this paper, allow to reliably infer
the expressions for the higher order generators, without having recourse to the
commutation relations. The transformationmatrices for Weyl spinors are derived
for finite values of the rotation and velocity, and field representations,
leading to the expression for the angular momentum operator, are studied.

the Krein signature of purely imaginary eigenvalues, which also can be used to
significantly reduce computational effort. In particular, we prove general
basic continuation results on Krein signature for finite systems of eigenvalues
in infinite-dimensional problems.

another spectral function, the (normalized) heat content. We show on several
exactly solvable examples that, for even $d$, the same asymptotic formula is

$d$-dimensional balls and two limiting cases of the elliptic domain with
eccentricity $\epsilon$: A slightly deformed disk ($\epsilon\to 0$) and an
extremely prolonged ellipse ($\epsilon\to 1$). These cases include 2D domains
with circular symmetry and those with only one shortest periodic orbit for the

particular interest as when all anyons are confined to the chain, it is readily
stabilised against fluctuations away from criticality. However, additional
local scaling operators have recently been identified on the disc which may
give rise to relevant fluctuations in the presence of free charges. Motivated
by these results for Fibonacci anyons, this paper presents a systematic method
of identifying all topological sectors of local scaling operators for critical
anyon rings of arbitrary winding number on surfaces of arbitrary genus,
extending the original classification scheme proposed in Feiguin et al. (2007).
Using the new scheme it is then shown that for the golden chain, additional
relevant scaling operators exist on the torus which are equivalent to those
detected on the disc, and which may disrupt the stability of the critical
system. Protection of criticality against perturbations generated by these
additional scaling operators can be achieved by suppressing the exchange of
charge between the anyon ring and the rest of the manifold.

The amplitude (longitudinal) fluctuations associated with the magnon modes are
already strong far away from T_C. Interestingly, even the non spin flip

observed Kohn anomalies in the phonon spectrum at those incommensurate
positions in reciprocal space, where the spin density wave is observed. The
corresponding phonon and magnon modes are not coupled. In addition, an
anomalous softening of a transverse phonon branch along the N-H zone boundary

quasistationary states (QSSs), with lifetimes diverging with the number N of
degrees of freedom, emerging from numerical simulations of the ferromagnetic XY
Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) starting from some special initial conditions.
Phase transitions have been reported between low-energy magnetized QSSs and
large-energy unexpected, antiferromagnetic-like, QSSs with low magnetization.
This issue is addressed here in the Vlasov N \rightarrow \infty limit. It is
argued that the time-asymptotic states emerging in the Vlasov limit can be
related to simple generic time-asymptotic forms for the force field. The
proposed picture unveils the nature of the out-of-equilibrium phase transitions
reported for the ferromagnetic HMF: this is a bifurcation point connecting an
effective integrable Vlasov one-particle time-asymptotic dynamics to a partly
ergodic one which means a brutal open-up of the Vlasov one-particle phase
space. Illustration is given by investigating the time-asymptotic value of the
magnetization at the phase transition, under the assumption of a sufficiently
rapid time-asymptotic decay of the transient force field.

achievable normalized log density (NLD) with vanishing error probability. This
capacity as well as error exponent bounds for this setting are known. In this
work we consider the optimal performance achievable in the fixed blocklength

validity of the sphere bound to finite dimensional infinite constellations. We
also provide asymptotic analysis of the bounds: When the NLD is fixed, we
provide asymptotic expansions for the bounds that are significantly tighter

fixed, we show that as n grows, the gap to capacity is inversely proportional
(up to the first order) to the square-root of n where the proportion constant
is given by the inverse Q-function of the allowed error probability, times the
square root of 1/2. In an analogy to similar result in channel coding, the
dispersion of infinite constellations is 1/2nat^2 per channel use. All our
achievability results use lattices and therefore hold for the maximal error
probability as well. Connections to the error exponent of the power constrained
Gaussian channel and to the volume-to-noise ratio as a figure of merit are
discussed. In addition, we demonstrate the tightness of the results numerically

years, of the optical and near-infrared photometric and polarimetric activity

occurred in all the photometric bands, whose declining phase ($\Delta$J
$\approx$ 3 mag) lasted about 120 days. A time lag of $\sim$ 30 days between
optical and infrared light curves has been measured and interpreted in the
framework of an accretion event. This latter is directly recognizable in the
significant variations of the near-infrared colors, that appear bluer in the
outburst phase, when the star dominates the emission, and redder in declining
phase, when the disk emission prevails. All the observational data have been
combined to derive a coherent picture of the complex morphology of the whole PV
Cep system, that, in addition to the star and the accretion disk, is composed
also by a variable biconical nebula. In particular, the mutual interaction
between all these components is the cause of the high value of the polarization
($\approx$ 20%) and of its fluctuations. The observational data concur to
indicate that PV Cep is not a genuine EXor star, but rather a more complex
object; moreover the case of PV Cep leads to argue about the classification of
other recently discovered young sources in outburst, that have been considered,
maybe over-simplifying, as EXor.

(for $x \geq 0.4$). The volume contraction thorough the series is comparable to
the expected from the atomic size ratio between transition metal components.
The consequent weak increase of the Kondo temperature drives the two
transitions observed in Ce$_2$Pd$_2$Sn to merge at $x = 0.25$. After about a 1%
of volume collapse at the structural modification, the system behaves as a
weakly magnetic heavy fermion with an enhanced degenerate ground state.
Notably, an incipient magnetic transition arises on the Ni-rich size. This

incipient contribution of the first excited crystal field doublet on the ground

provide a probe of the internal planetary structure. Previous analyses of
radial velocity and transit timing data of the system suggested that the
observational constraints on the orbital states were rather small. We reanalyze
the available data, treating the jitter as an unknown MCMC parameter, and find
that a wide range of jitter values are plausible, hence the system parameters
are less well constrained than previously suggested. For slightly increased
levels of jitter ($\sim 4.5\,m\,s^{-1}$) the eccentricity of the inner planet
can be in the range $0<e_{inner}<0.07$, the period and eccentricity of the
outer planet can be $440<P_{outer}<470$ days and $0.55<e_{outer}<0.85$
respectively, while the relative pericenter alignment, $\eta$, of the planets
can take essentially any value $-180^{\circ}<\eta<+180^{\circ}$. It is
therefore difficult to determine whether $e_{inner}$ and $\eta$ have evolved to
a fixed-point state or a limit cycle, or to use $e_{inner}$ to probe the
internal planetary structure. We perform various transit timing variation (TTV)
analyses, demonstrating that current constraints merely restrict
$e_{outer}<0.85$, and rule out relative planetary inclinations within $\sim
2^{\circ}$ of $i_{rel}=90^{\circ}$, but that future observations could
significantly tighten the restriction on both these parameters. We demonstrate
that TTV profiles can readily distinguish the theoretically favored
inclinations of $i_{rel}=0^{\circ}\,&\,45^{\circ}$, provided that sufficiently
precise and frequent transit timing observations of HAT-P-13b can be made close
to the pericenter passage of HAT-P-13c. We note the relatively high probability

gas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of the
dissipation of large-scale turbulence.

evolution of the large scale structure, whose diagnostic power depends quite
significantly on the ability to reliably determine their masses. Clusters are
typically modeled as spherical systems whose intracluster gas is in strict
hydrostatic equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium gas pressure is provided
entirely by thermal pressure), with the gravitational field dominated by dark
matter, assumptions that are only rough approximations. In fact, numerical
simulations indicate that galaxy clusters are typically triaxial, rather than
spherical, and that turbulent gas motions (induced during hierarchical merger
events) provide an appreciable pressure component. Extending our previous work,
we present results of a joint analysis of X-ray, weak and strong lensing
measurements of Abell 1689. The quality of the data allows us to determine both
the triaxial shape of the cluster and the level of non-thermal pressure that is
required if the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that
the dark matter axis ratios are 1.24 +/- 0.13 and 2.02 +/- 0.01 on the plane of
the sky and along the line of sight, respectively, and that about 20% of the
pressure is non-thermal. Our treatment demonstrates that the dynamical
properties of clusters can be determined in a (mostly) bias-free way, enhancing
the use of clusters as more precise cosmological probes.

powers of linear forms expressing f. Under certain conditions, such a
decomposition is unique. We discuss some algorithms to compute the Waring
decomposition, which are linked to the equation of certain secant varieties and
to eigenvectors of tensors. In particular we explicitly decompose a general
cubic polynomial in three variables as the sum of five cubes (Sylvester
Pentahedral Theorem).

large number of techniques have been developed to predict the bankruptcy, which
helps the decision makers such as investors and financial analysts. One of the
bankruptcy prediction models is the hybrid model using Fuzzy C-means clustering
and MARS, which uses static ratios taken from the bank financial statements for
prediction, which has its own theoretical advantages. The performance of
existing bankruptcy model can be improved by selecting the best features
dynamically depend on the nature of the firm. This dynamic selection can be
accomplished by Genetic Algorithm and it improves the performance of prediction
