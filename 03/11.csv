problem by means of Augmented Reality. The merging of the real world model and
digital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the
whole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality
is the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable
digital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using
identification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not
necessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real
world model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of
outlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the
camera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of
the article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and
orientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is
generalized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in
space. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the
description of representation of their position and orientation be means of
transformation matrix. This matrix is used for rendering of the graphical
objects (e. g. in OpenGL and Direct3D).

expressions for some form factors and check those expressions for consistency,
mainly by evaluating the conformal dimension of the corresponding twist field

factor equations are not unique so that various techniques need to be used to
identify those corresponding to the branch point twist field we are interested

patterns of various physical quantities as functions of the energy scale. As
the latter is varied, the beta-function associated to these theories comes
close to vanishing at several points between the deep infrared and deep
ultraviolet regimes. In other words, renormalisation group flows approach the
vicinity of various critical points before ultimately reaching the ultraviolet
fixed point. This feature provides an optimal way of checking the consistency
of higher particle form factor solutions, as the changes on the conformal
dimension of the twist field at various energy scales can only be accounted for
by considering higher particle form factor contributions to the expansion of

physical (PHY) layer security techniques, i.e., joint power control and
beamforming. By first assuming that the Channel State Information (CSI) is
available and the beamforming weights are fixed, a novel secure satellite
system design is investigated to minimize the transmit power with individual
secrecy rate constraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain an
optimized power allocation strategy. Moreover, sub-optimal beamforming weights
are obtained by completely eliminating the co-channel interference and nulling
the eavesdroppers' signal simultaneously. In order to obtain jointly optimized
power allocation and beamforming strategy in some practical cases, e.g., with
certain estimation errors of the CSI, we further evaluate the impact of the
eavesdropper's CSI on the secure multibeam satellite system design. The
convergence of the iterative algorithm is proven under justifiable assumptions.
The performance is evaluated by taking into account the impact of the number of
antenna elements, number of beams, individual secrecy rate requirement, and
CSI. The proposed novel secure multibeam satellite system design can achieve
optimized power allocation to ensure the minimum individual secrecy rate
requirement. The results show that the joint beamforming scheme is more
favorable than fixed beamforming scheme, especially in the cases of a larger
number of satellite antenna elements and higher secrecy rate requirement.
Finally, we compare the results under the current satellite air-interface in
DVB-S2 and the results under Gaussian inputs.

galaxy-dark matter connection, to constrain cosmological parameters, and to
test the nature of gravity. In this paper, we focus on a theoretical model that
describes the galaxy-dark matter connection based on standard halo occupation
distribution techniques. Several key modifications enable us to extract
additional parameters that determine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and to
simultaneously fit data from multiple probes while allowing for independent
binning schemes for each probe. In a companion paper, we demonstrate that the
model presented here provides an excellent fit to galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy
clustering, and stellar mass functions measured in the COSMOS survey from z=0.2

the effects of sample variance and covariance on each of the three probes.

impact the derived parameters of the model. In particular, we investigate the
various features of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (low-mass slope,
plateau, knee, and high-mass cut-off) and show how each feature is related to
the underlying relationship between stellar and halo mass. We demonstrate that
the observed plateau feature in the stellar mass function at Mstellar~2x10^10
Msun is due to the transition that occurs in the stellar-to-halo mass relation
at Mhalo ~ 10^12 Msun from a low-mass power-law regime to a sub-exponential

periods, and the observation that planets on closer orbits tend to be heavier.
The first feature is interpreted as a signature of tidal evolution, while the
origin of the second, a ""mass-period relation"" for hot Jupiters, is not
understood. In this paper we re-consider the ensemble properties of transiting
exoplanets with well-measured parameters, focussing on orbital eccentricity and
the mass-period relation. We recalculate the constraints on eccentricity in a
homogeneous way, using new radial-velocity data, with particular attention to
statistical biases. We find that planets on circular orbits gather in a
well-defined region of the mass-period plane, close to the minimum period for
any given mass. Exceptions to this pattern reported in the Literature can be
attributed to statistical biases. The ensemble data is compatible with
classical tide theory with orbital circularisation caused by tides raised on
the planet, and suggest that tidal circularisation and the stopping mechanisms
for close-in planets are closely related to each other. The position
mass-period relation is compatible with a relation between a planet's Hill
radius and its present orbit.

lower limits on the column densities of hot HCN, which are several times

detect velocity components in SgrB2-M at 50, 60, and 70 km/s relative to the

heated by stars in the HII regions, and derive masses of hot (>300 K) molecular
gas of more than 100 solar masses (for an HCN fractional abundance of

including a perturbation orbit for this previously known spectroscopic binary,

test of finding subhaloes demonstrates that HBT stands as one of the best codes
to trace the evolutionary history of subhaloes. The success of the code lies in
its careful treatment of the complex physical processes associated with the
evolution of subhaloes and in its robust unbinding algorithm with an adaptive

haloes and subhaloes, and allow growth of satellite subhaloes through accretion

Local accretion of background mass is omitted, while rebinding of stripped mass

of the lives of individual subhaloes and by the success in finding the complete
subhalo catalogue. We compare our result to other popular subhalo finders and

$(X,\mathcal{B}, \mu)$ such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu (B_{i}) = \infty$.
The classical Borel-Cantelli lemma states that if the sets $B_{i}$ are
independent, then $\mu (\{x \in X : x \in B_{i} \text{infinitely often (i.o.)})
= 1$. Suppose $(T,X,\mu)$ is a dynamical system and $(B_i)$ is a sequence of
sets in $X$. We consider whether $T^i x\in B_i$ for $\mu$ a.e.\ $x\in X$ and if
so, is there an asymptotic estimate on the rate of entry. If $T^i x\in B_i$
infinitely often for $\mu$ a.e.\ $x$ we call the sequence $B_i$ a
Borel--Cantelli sequence. If the sets $B_i:= B(p,r_i)$ are nested balls about a
point $p$ then the question of whether $T^i x\in B_i$ infinitely often for
$\mu$ a.e.\ $x$ is often called the shrinking target problem. We show, under
certain assumptions on the measure $\mu$, that for balls $B_i$ if $\mu (B_i)\ge
i^{-\gamma}$, $0<\gamma <1$, then a sufficiently high polynomial rate of decay
of correlations for Lipschitz observations implies that the sequence is
Borel-Cantelli. If $\mu (B_i)\ge \frac{C\log i}{i}$ then exponential decay of
correlations implies that the sequence is Borel-Cantelli. If it is only assumed
that $\mu (B_i) \ge \frac{1}{i}$ then we give conditions in terms of return
time statistics which imply that for $\mu$ a.e.\ $p$ sequences of nested balls
$B(p,1/i)$ are Borel-Cantelli. Corollaries of our results are that for planar
dispersing billiards and Lozi maps $\mu$ a.e.\ $p$ sequences of nested balls

two objects are consistent with the trends in sigma_v and r_{half} set by their
MW counterparts. We also investigate the nature of this scatter about the MW
dSph mass profiles for the ""Classical"" (i.e. M_V<-8) MW and M31 dSphs. When
comparing both the ""classical"" MW and M31 dSphs to the best--fit mass profiles
in the size--velocity dispersion plane, we find general scatter in both the
positive (i.e. hotter) and negative (i.e. colder) directions from these
profiles. However, barring one exception (CVnI) only the M31 dSphs are found to
scatter towards a colder regime, and, excepting the And I dSph, only MW objects
scatter to hotter dispersions. We also note that the scatter for the combined
population is greater than expected from measurement errors alone. We assess
this divide in the context of the differing disc-to-halo mass (i.e. stars and
baryons to total virial mass) ratios of the two hosts and argue that the
underlying mass profiles for dSphs differ from galaxy to galaxy, and are

naturally explain population of the observable sector and creation of matter

about the minimum of its potential, which is a point of {\it enhanced gauged
symmetry}. This results in bursts of non-perturbative production of the
gauge/gaugino and (s)lepton quanta. The subsequent decay of these quanta is
very fast and leads to an extremely efficient transfer of the inflaton energy
to (s)quarks via {\it instant} preheating. Around 20% of the inflaton energy
density is drained during every inflaton oscillation. However, all of the
Standard Model degrees of freedom (and their supersymmetric partners) {\it do
not} thermalize immediately, since the large inflaton vacuum expectation value
breaks the electroweak symmetry. After about 100 oscillations -- albeit within
one Hubble time -- the amplitude of inflaton oscillations becomes sufficiently
small, and all of the degrees of freedom will thermalize. This provides by far
the most efficient reheating of the universe with the observed degrees of
freedom.

absorption-line systems. We find that much of the stream gas is ionized by UV
radiation from background and local stellar sources, but still optically thick
(N_HI > 10^17 cm^-2) so that the streams appear as Lyman-limit systems (LLSs).
At z>3, the fraction of neutral gas in streams becomes non-negligible, giving
rise to damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) absorbers as well. The gas in the central and
incoming galaxies remains mostly neutral, responsible for DLAs. Within one
(two) virial radii, the covering factor of optically thick gas is <25% (10%)
for LLSs and <5% (1%) for DLAs, slowly declining with time following the
universal expansion. Nevertheless, galaxies and their cold streams in the
studied mass range, M_vir = 10^10 - 10^12 Msun, account for >30% of the
observed absorbers in the foreground of quasars, the rest possibly arising from
smaller galaxies or the intergalactic medium. The mean metallicity in the
streams is ~1% solar, much lower than in the galaxies. The simulated galaxies
reproduce the Lyalpha-absorption equivalent widths observed around Lyman-break
galaxies, but they severely underpredict the equivalent widths in metal lines,
suggesting that the latter may arise from outflows. We conclude that the
observed metal-poor LLSs are likely detections of the predicted cold streams.
Revised analysis of the observed LLSs kinematics and simulations with more

properties of large-scale structure in the Universe. We do this by extending
the halo model. The new development is that we consider two components to the
mass density: one arising from mass in collapsed haloes, and the second from a
smooth component of uncollapsed mass. Assuming that the nonlinear clustering of
dark matter haloes can be understood, then from conservation arguments one can
precisely calculate the clustering properties of the smooth component and its
cross-correlation with haloes. We then explore how the three main ingredients
of the halo calculations, the mass function, bias and density profiles are
affected by WDM. We show that, relative to CDM: the mass function is suppressed
by ~50%, for masses ~100 times the free-streaming mass-scale; the bias of low
mass haloes can be boosted by up to 20%; core densities of haloes can be
suppressed. We also examine the impact of relic thermal velocities on the
density profiles, and find that these effects are constrained to scales r<1
kpc/h, and hence of little importance for dark matter tests, owing to
uncertainties in the baryonic physics. We use our modified halo model to
calculate the non-linear matter power spectrum, and find significant
small-scale power in the model. However, relative to the CDM case, the power is
suppressed. We then calculate the expected signal and noise that our set of
LWDM models would give for a future weak lensing mission. We show that the
models should in principle be separable at high significance. Finally, using
the Fisher matrix formalism we forecast the limit on the WDM particle mass for
a future full-sky weak lensing mission like Euclid or LSST. With Planck priors
and using multipoles l<5000, we find that a lower limit of 2.6 keV should be
easily achievable.

stringent calibration requirements for removing bright foregrounds. It is
unclear what the optimal design is for achieving both of these goals. Via a
pedagogical derivation of an interferometer's response to the power spectrum of
21cm reionization fluctuations, we show that even under optimistic scenarios,
first-generation arrays will yield low-SNR detections, and that different
compact array configurations can substantially alter sensitivity. We explore
the sensitivity gains of array configurations that yield high redundancy in the
uv-plane -- configurations that have been largely ignored since the advent of
self-calibration for high-dynamic-range imaging. We first introduce a
mathematical framework to generate optimal minimum-redundancy configurations
for imaging. We contrast the sensitivity of such configurations with
high-redundancy configurations, finding that high-redundancy configurations can
improve power-spectrum sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude. We
explore how high-redundancy array configurations can be tuned to various
angular scales, enabling array sensitivity to be directed away from regions of
the uv-plane (such as the origin) where foregrounds are brighter and where
instrumental systematics are more problematic. We demonstrate that a
132-antenna deployment of the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of
Reionization (PAPER) observing for 120 days in a high-redundancy configuration
will, under ideal conditions, have the requisite sensitivity to detect the
power spectrum of the 21cm signal from reionization at a 3\sigma level at

atomic-scale systems. This has fueled progress towards quantum computers by
preparing trapped ions in their motional ground state, and generating new
states of matter by achieving Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic vapors.
Analogous cooling techniques provide a general and flexible method for
preparing macroscopic objects in their motional ground state, bringing the
powerful technology of micromechanics into the quantum regime. Cavity opto- or
electro-mechanical systems achieve sideband cooling through the strong
interaction between light and motion. However, entering the quantum regime,
less than a single quantum of motion, has been elusive because sideband cooling
has not sufficiently overwhelmed the coupling of mechanical systems to their
hot environments. Here, we demonstrate sideband cooling of the motion of a
micromechanical oscillator to the quantum ground state. Entering the quantum
regime requires a large electromechanical interaction, which is achieved by
embedding a micromechanical membrane into a superconducting microwave resonant
circuit. In order to verify the cooling of the membrane motion into the quantum
regime, we perform a near quantum-limited measurement of the microwave field,
resolving this motion a factor of 5.1 from the Heisenberg limit. Furthermore,
our device exhibits strong-coupling allowing coherent exchange of microwave
photons and mechanical phonons. Simultaneously achieving strong coupling,
ground state preparation and efficient measurement sets the stage for rapid
advances in the control and detection of non-classical states of motion,
possibly even testing quantum theory itself in the unexplored region of larger
size and mass.

production is modeled through the color glass condensate, which uses the
quark(and gluon)--condensate amplitudes in momentum space. The AGBS model is
also a momentum space model based on the asymptotic solutions of the BK

This aspect is overcome and a description entirely in transverse momentum of
both processes arises for the first time. The small difference between the
simultaneous fit and the one for HERA data alone suggests that the AGBS model
describes very well both kind of processes and thus emerges as a good tool to
investigate the inclusive hadron production data. We use this model for
predictions at LHC energies, which agree very well with available experimental

Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory and with the 0.9m
telescope at the Brigham Young University West Mountain Observatory over the

than a factor of 2 change in broad H-beta flux. From cross-correlation
measurements, we find that the H-beta light curve has a rest-frame lag of
3.86(+0.69,-0.90) days with respect to the V-band continuum variations. We also
measure reverberation lags for H-alpha and H-gamma and find an upper limit to
the H-delta lag. Combining the H-beta lag measurement with a broad H-beta width
of sigma = 1590+/-47 km/s measured from the root-mean-square variability

develop a tractable, flexible, and accurate model for a downlink heterogeneous

external validation, we compare against an actual LTE network (for tier 1) with

with star formation rates down to ~0.3Msun/yr throughout the 27'x27' field, and
we identified 445 H-alpha emitters along the large-scale structures around the
cluster. Using this sample, we find that (1) the fraction of H-alpha emitters

cluster central region. We also find that (2) the color of H-alpha emitters is

blue colors with B-I<2, but we find H-alpha emitters with red colors as well.
Such red emitters are very rare in the cluster center or its immediate
surrounding regions, while they are most frequently found in groups located far
away from the cluster center. These groups coincide with the environment where
a sharp transition in galaxy color distribution is seen. This may suggest that
dusty star formation activity tends to be involved in galaxy truncation
processes that are effective in groups, and it is probably related to the
""pre-processing"" that generates present-day cluster S0 galaxies. Finally, we
confirm that (3) the mass-normalized integrated star formation rate in clusters

HII/AGN composites and 40% of LINERs; we advocate the use of a LX >10^41 erg/s
in the X-ray selection of AGN, which gives a contamination rate of only 3% from
star-forming galaxies; Sy 1s and Sy 2 have the same intrinsic {\Gamma}; in 24%
of cases the absorption measured in X-rays does not correspond directly with
that implied in the optical band from the visibility of the BLRs; the obscured
fraction in AGN is a strong function of LX peaking at 10^42 erg/s; The average
obscured and Compton thick fractions for this sample are 62\pm5% and 20\pm4%
respectively, which are higher than hard X-ray and optically selected samples;
we assess the use of the T ratio (FX/F[OIII]) for selecting Compton thick
candidates. We conclude here that this quantity can often be unreliable due
uncertainties in the extinction corrections to the [OIII] flux. These results
have important impacts on AGN selection and unification and the results from
the 12MGS are particularly useful as a local analogue to z=1 24 um samples.

investigate the height distribution of coronal electrons by focusing on the
energy-dependent pitch-angle scattering. When pitch-angle scattering is not
included, the peak heights of loop-top electrons are constant, regardless of
their energy, owing to the continuous acceleration and compression of the
electrons via shrinkage of magnetic loops. On the other hand, under pitch-angle
scattering, the electron heights are energy dependent; intermediate energy
electrons are at a higher altitude, whereas lower and higher energy electrons
are at lower altitudes. This implies that the intermediate energy electrons are
inhibited to follow the shrinking field lines to lower altitudes because
pitch-angle scattering causes efficient precipitation of these electrons into
the footpoint and their subsequent loss from the loop. This result is
qualitatively consistent with the position of the above-the-loop-top hard X-ray
(HXR) source that is located above coronal HXR loops emitted by lower energy
electrons and microwaves emitted by higher energy electrons. Quantitative
agreement with observations might be achieved by considering primary
acceleration before the onset of loop shrinkage and additional pitch-angle
scattering via wave-particle interactions.

cells consistently report ''anomalous diffusion'', where mean-squared
displacements scale as a power law of time with exponent $\alpha< 1$
(subdiffusion). While the detailed mechanisms causing such behaviors are not
always elucidated, movement hindrance by obstacles is often invoked. However,
our understanding of how hindered diffusion leads to subdiffusion is based on
diffusion amidst randomly-located \textit{immobile} obstacles. Here, we have
used Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate transient subdiffusion due to
\textit{mobile} obstacles with various modes of mobility. Our simulations
confirm that the anomalous regimes rapidly disappear when the obstacles move by
Brownian motion. By contrast, mobile obstacles with more confined
displacements, e.g. Orstein-Ulhenbeck motion, are shown to preserve
subdiffusive regimes. The mean-squared displacement of tracked protein displays
convincing power-laws with anomalous exponent $\alpha$ that varies with the
density of OU obstacles or the relaxation time-scale of the OU process. In
particular, some of the values we observed are significantly below the
universal value predicted for immobile obstacles in 2d. Therefore, our results
show that subdiffusion due to mobile obstacles with OU-type of motion may
account for the large variation range exhibited by experimental measurements in

independent) elements in either the rational integers, the polynomials in one
variable over the complex numbers, or the polynomials in one variable over a
finite field. In the case of the rational integers, Bugeaud, Corvaja and
Zannier have obtained an upper bound exp(\epsilon n) for any given \epsilon >0

paper of Adleman, Pomerance, and Rumely a lower bound \exp(\exp(c\frac{log
n}{loglog n})) for infinitely many n, where c is an absolute constant. The
upper bound generalizes immediately to gcd(\Phi_N(a^n), \Phi_N(b^n)) for any
positive integer N, where \Phi_N(x)$ is the Nth cyclotomic polynomial, the
preceding being the case N=1. The lower bound has been generalized in the first
author's Ph.D. thesis to N=2. In this paper we generalize the lower bound for
arbitrary N but under GRH (the generalized Riemann Hypothesis). The analogue of
the lower bound result for gcd(a^n-1,b^n-1) over F_q[T] was proved by
Silverman; we prove a corresponding generalization (without GRH).

commonly used to guide users' judgements in online auction sites; or to
determine quality of contributions in Web 2.0 sites. However, most existing
systems require historical information about the past behavior of the specific
agent being judged. In contrast, in real life, to anticipate and to predict a
stranger's actions in absence of the knowledge of such behavioral history, we
often use our ""instinct""- essentially stereotypes developed from our past
interactions with other ""similar"" persons. In this paper, we propose
StereoTrust, a computational trust model inspired by stereotypes as used in
real-life. A stereotype contains certain features of agents and an expected
outcome of the transaction. When facing a stranger, an agent derives its trust
by aggregating stereotypes matching the stranger's profile. Since stereotypes
are formed locally, recommendations stem from the trustor's own personal
experiences and perspective. Historical behavioral information, when available,
can be used to refine the analysis. According to our experiments using
Epinions.com dataset, StereoTrust compares favorably with existing trust models
that use different kinds of information and more complete historical

actions as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. To protect
elections from such control attempts, computational complexity has been
investigated and the corresponding NP-hardness results are termed ""resistance.""
It has been a long-running project of research in this area to classify the
major voting systems in terms of their resistance properties. We show that
fallback voting, an election system proposed by Brams and Sanver (2009) to
combine Bucklin with approval voting, is resistant to each of the common types
of control except to destructive control by either adding or deleting voters.
Thus fallback voting displays the broadest control resistance currently known
to hold among natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem.
We also study the control complexity of Bucklin voting and show that it
performs at least almost as well as fallback voting in terms of control
resistance. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting, each
resistance shown for Bucklin voting strengthens the corresponding resistance
for fallback voting. Such worst-case complexity analysis is at best an
indication of security against control attempts, rather than a proof. In
practice, the difficulty of control will depend on the structure of typical
instances. We investigate the parameterized control complexity of Bucklin and
fallback voting, according to several parameters that are often likely to be
small for typical instances. Our results, though still in the worst-case
complexity model, can be interpreted as significant strengthenings of the
resistance demonstrations based on NP-hardness.

that the magnetic field in the heliosheath, in the region close to the

field is not laminar but instead consists of magnetic bubbles. Recently, we
proposed that the annihilation of the ""sectored"" magnetic field within the
heliosheath as it is compressed on its approach to the heliopause produces the
anomalous cosmic rays and also energetic electrons. As a product of the
annihilation of the sectored magnetic field, densely-packed magnetic
islands/bubbles are produced. These magnetic islands/bubbles will be convected
with the ambient flows as the sector region is carried to higher latitudes
filling the heliosheath. We further argue that the magnetic islands/bubbles
will develop upstream within the heliosheath. As a result, the magnetic field
in the heliosheath sector region will be disordered well upstream of the
heliopause. We present a 3D MHD simulation with very high numerical resolution
that captures the north-south boundaries of the sector region. We show that due
to the high pressure of the interstellar magnetic field a north-south asymmetry
develops such that the disordered sectored region fills a large portion of the
northern part of the heliosphere with a smaller extension in the southern
hemisphere. We suggest that this scenario is supported by the following changes
that occur around 2008 and from 2009.16 onward: a) the sudden decrease in the
intensity of low energy electrons detected by Voyager 2; b) a sharp reduction
in the intensity of fluctuations of the radial flow; and c) the dramatic
differences in intensity trends between GCRs at V1 and 2. We argue that these
observations are a consequence of V2 leaving the sector region of disordered
field during these periods and crossing into a region of unipolar laminar
field.

(recombination) is also studied and probability distributions for the
recombination times and overstretched bond lengths are obtained.
  Our extensive simulations reveal many properties of the scission dynamics in
agreement with the notion of random breakdown of independent bonds, e.g., the
mean time of chain rupture, $<\tau>$ follows an Arrhenian behavior with
temperature $T$, and depends on the number of bonds $N$ in the polymer as
$<\tau> \propto N^{-1}$. In contrast, the rupture rates of the individual bonds
along the polymer backbone indicate clearly the presence of self-induced
inhomogeneity resulting from the interplay of thermal noise and nonlinearity.
  Eventually we examine the fragmentation kinetics during thermolysis. We
demonstrate that both the probability distribution function of fragment sizes
as well as the mean length of fragments at subsequent times $t$ characterize

station (MBS) protects itself by pricing the interference from the femtocell
users, a Stackelberg game is formulated to study the joint utility maximization
of the macrocell and the femtocells subject to a maximum tolerable interference
power constraint at the MBS. Especially, two practical femtocell channel
models: sparsely deployed scenario for rural areas and densely deployed

schemes: uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing, are proposed. Then, the
Stackelberg equilibriums for these proposed games are studied, and an effective

both interfacial free energies and line tensions by Monte Carlo simulations of
simple models, (e.g. the Ising model, a symmetrical binary Lennard-Jones fluid
exhibiting a miscibility gap, and a simple Lennard-Jones fluid). One method is
based on thermodynamic integration. This method is useful to study flat and

tensions of three-phase contact lines, when the interfaces meet walls (where
""surface fields"" may act). A generalization to off-lattice systems is described
as well.

distribution of the system throughout the two-phase coexistence region of the
model. Both the interface free energies of flat interfaces and of (spherical or
cylindrical) droplets (or bubbles) can be estimated, including also systems
with walls, where sphere-cap shaped wall-attached droplets occur. The
curvature-dependence of the interfacial free energy is discussed, and estimates
for the line tensions are compared to results from the thermodynamic

pulsars showing pulse shape changes on a range of timescales. Here, we show the
dramatic appearance of a bright component in the pulse profile of PSR
J0738-4042 (B0736-40). The component arises on the leading edge of the profile.
It was not present in 2004 but strongly present in 2006 and all observations
thereafter. A subsequent search through the literature shows the additional
component varies in flux density over timescales of decades. We show that the
polarization properties of the transient component are consistent with the
picture of competing orthogonal polarization modes. Faced with the general
problem of identifying and characterising average profile changes, we outline
and apply a statistical technique based on a Hidden Markov Model. The value of
this technique is established through simulations, and is shown to work
successfully in the case of low signal-to-noise profiles.

the response of the background plasma in the form of Langmuir waves using the

interactions to collisional transport for a transient initially injected
electron beam flattens the spectrum of the footpoint source. The coronal source
is unchanged and so the difference in the spectral indices between the coronal
and footpoint sources is \Delta \gamma > 2, which is larger than expected from
purely collisional transport. A steady-state beam shows little difference
between the two cases, as has been previously found, as a transiently injected
electron beam is required to produce significant wave growth, especially at
higher velocities. With this transiently injected beam the wave-particle
interactions dominate in the corona whereas the collisional losses dominate in
the chromosphere. The shape of the spectrum is different with increasing
electron beam density in the wave-particle interaction case whereas with purely
collisional transport only the normalisation is changed. We also find that the
starting height of the source electron beam above the photosphere affects the
spectral index of the footpoint when Langmuir wave growth is included. This may
account for the differing spectral indices found between double footpoints if
asymmetrical injection has occurred in the flaring loop.

combines a smooth surface morphology with a large magnetization and a small
residual resistivity, while avoiding precipitates and surface segregation. In
literature, typically only a few of these issues are adressed. We therefore
present a thorough characterization of our films, which were grown by pulsed
laser deposition. The films were characterized with reflection high energy
electron diffraction, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction, magnetization
and transport measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning
transmission electron microscopy. The films have a saturation magnetization of
4.0 {\mu}B/Mn, a Curie temperature of 350 K and a residual resistivity of 60
{\mu}{\Omega}cm. These results indicate that high quality films, combining both
large magnetization and small residual resistivity, were realized. A comparison
between different samples presented in literature shows that focussing on a
single property is insufficient for the optimization of the deposition process.
For high quality films, all properties have to be adressed. For LSMO devices,
the thin film quality is crucial for the device performance. Therefore, this
research is important for the application of LSMO in devices.

qubit, via linear coupling on the beam splitter. We report on the degradation
of the ""signal"" photon interference depending on the degree of
indistinguishability between ""signal"" and ""noise"" photon. When the photons are
principally completely distinguishable but technically indistinguishable the
visibility drops to the value 1/sqrt(2). As the photons become more
indistinguishable the maximal visibility increases and reaches the unit value
for completely indistinguishable photons. We have examined this effect
experimentally using setup with fiber optics two-photon Mach-Zehnder

typically consist of complex hierarchical assemblies of simple building blocks.
Here we describe an application of category theory to describe structural and
resulting functional properties of biological protein materials by developing
so-called ologs. An olog is like a ""concept web"" or ""semantic network"" except
that it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory.
This key difference ensures that an olog is unambiguous, highly adaptable to
evolution and change, and suitable for sharing concepts with other olog. We
consider simple cases of alpha-helical and amyloid-like protein filaments
subjected to axial extension and develop an olog representation of their
structural and resulting mechanical properties. We also construct a
representation of a social network in which people send text-messages to their
nearest neighbors and act as a team to perform a task. We show that the olog
for the protein and the olog for the social network feature identical
category-theoretic representations, and we proceed to precisely explicate the
analogy or isomorphism between them. The examples presented here demonstrate
that the intrinsic nature of a complex system, which in particular includes a
precise relationship between structure and function at different hierarchical
levels, can be effectively represented by an olog. This, in turn, allows for
comparative studies between disparate materials or fields of application, and
results in novel approaches to derive functionality in the design of de novo
hierarchical systems. We discuss opportunities and challenges associated with
the description of complex biological materials by using ologs as a powerful
tool for analysis and design in the context of materiomics, and we present the
potential impact of this approach for engineering, life sciences, and medicine.

have transmission permits; they generate messages at a constant rate and send
each message to a randomly selected neighbor. By using different strategies to
control the transmission permits we can obtain tradeoffs between message and
time complexity. Gossip corresponds to the case when all nodes have permits all
the time. We study algorithms where permits are revoked after transmission and
restored upon reception. Examples of such algorithms include Simple-Random

two-phase algorithm switching from CRW to CFLD at a suitable pre-determined

achieve significant gains in both message and time complexity. The per-node
message complexity for n-node graphs, such as 2D mesh, torii, and Random

dominated by the ejecta. In this remnant, the presence of overionized plasma
has been directly established, with information about its spatial structure.
However, the physical origin of the overionized plasma in W49B has not yet been
understood. We investigate this intriguing issue through a 2D hydrodynamic
model that takes into account, for the first time, the mixing of ejecta with
the inhomogeneous circumstellar and interstellar medium, the thermal
conduction, the radiative losses from optically thin plasma, and the deviations
from equilibrium of ionization induced by plasma dynamics. The model was set up
on the basis of the observational results. We found that the thermal conduction
plays an important role in the evolution of W49B, in- ducing the evaporation of
the circumstellar ring-like cloud (whose presence has been deduced from
previous observations) that mingles with the surrounding hot medium, cooling
down the shocked plasma, and pushes the ejecta backwards to the center of the
remnant, forming there a jet-like structure. During the evolution, a large
region of overionized plasma forms within the remnant. The overionized plasma
originates from the rapid cooling of the hot plasma originally heated by the
shock reflected from the dense ring-like cloud. In particular, we found two
different ways for the rapid cooling of plasma to appear: i) the mixing of
relatively cold and dense material evaporated from the ring with the hot
shocked plasma and ii) the rapid adiabatic expansion of the ejecta. The spatial
distribution of the radiative recombination continuum predicted by the
numerical model is in good agreement with that observed.

ground-based proper motion (PM) components have on the determination of a star
cluster's velocity dispersion (\sv). Rather than histograms, we work with PM
distribution functions (PMDFs), taking the $1\sigma$ uncertainties formally
into account. In this context, a cluster's intrinsic PMDF is broadened by the
error distribution function (eDF) that, given the average error amplitude, has
a width usually comparable to the cluster PMDF. Thus, we apply a
Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution to the PMDFs of a set of relatively nearby
and populous open clusters (OCs), using the eDFs as point spread functions
(PSFs). The OCs are NGC\,1039 (M\,34), NGC\,2477, NGC\,2516, NGC\,2682 (M\,67),
and NGC\,7762. The deconvolved PMDFs are approximately Gaussian in shape, with
dispersions lower than the observed ones by a factor of 4-10. NGC\,1039 and
NGC\,2516, the nearest OCs of the sample, have deconvolved \sv\ compatible with
those of bound OCs of mass $\sim10^3$\,\ms. NGC\,2477 and NGC\,2682 have
deconvolved PMDFs with a secondary bump, shifted towards higher average
velocities, which may be an artefact of the RL deconvolution when applied to
asymmetric profiles. Alternatively, it may originate from cluster merger,
large-scale mass segregation or, least probably, binaries.

  clusters related to the H\,II region NGC\,2174 (Sh2-252)","Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18693.x",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate 5 embedded clusters (ECs) and the extended stellar group
itself of the prominent H\,II region NGC\,2174 (Sh2-252), which presents scarce
and heterogeneous information, coming from the optical and infrared.
Considering the discrepant values of distance and age, the clusters and the
H\,II region appear to be physically unrelated. The analysis is based on
field-star decontaminated 2MASS photometry, which allows sampling the pre-main
sequence (PMS). We find that Sh2-252A, C, E, NGC\,2175s, and Teu\,136 are small
ECs (radius within $1.0 - 2.3$\,pc) characterised by a similar age
($\sim5$\,Myr), reddening ($\aV\sim1$), distance from the Sun
($\ds\sim1.4$\,kpc), and low mass ($60-200\,\ms$). This age is consistent with
the H\,II region, the presence of O and B stars still in the MS, and the
dominance ($\ga95%$ in number) of PMS stars in colour-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs). NGC\,2175 is not a star cluster, but an extended stellar group that
encompasses the ECs Sh2-252\,A and C. It contains $\sim36%$ of the member stars
(essentially PMS) in the area, with the remaining belonging to the 2 ECs. CMDs
of the overall star-forming region and the ECs provide $\ds=1.4\pm0.4$\,kpc for
the NGC\,2174 complex, consistent with the value estimated for the
physically-related association Gem\,OB1. Our uniform approach shows that
NGC\,2174 and its related ECs (except, perhaps, for Teu\,136) are part of a
single star-forming complex. CMD similarities among the ECs and the overall
region suggest a coeval (to within $\pm5$\,Myr) star-forming event extending
for several Myr. At least 4 ECs originated in the event, together with the
off-cluster star formation that probably gave rise to the scattered stars of
NGC\,2175.

disordered potential. We consider an anisotropic speckle potential and focus on
the classical regime, which is relevant to some recent experiments. First, we
study the behavior of particles with a fixed energy and identify different
transport regimes. For low energy, the particles are classically localized due
to the absence of a percolating cluster. For high energy, the particles undergo
normal diffusion and we show that the diffusion constants scale algebraically
with the particle energy, with an anisotropy factor which significantly differs
from that of the disordered potential. For intermediate energy, we find a
transient sub-diffusive regime, which is relevant to the time scale of typical
experiments. Second, we study the behavior of a cold-atomic gas with an
arbitrary energy distribution, using the above results as a groundwork. We show
that the density profile of the atomic cloud in the diffusion regime is
strongly peaked and, in particular, that it is not Gaussian. Its behavior at
large distances allows us to extract the energy-dependent diffusion constants
from experimental density distributions. For a thermal cloud released into the
disordered potential, we show that our numerical predictions are in agreement
with experimental findings. Not only does this work give insights to recent
experimental results, but it may also serve interpretation of future
experiments searching for deviation from classical diffusion and traces of
Anderson localization.

O(1/Lambda^4). A simple formalism to test and constrain models of new physics
is provided. We find that a large asymmetry cannot be accommodated by heavy new
physics that does not interfere with the standard model. We show that a smoking
gun test for the heavy new physics hypothesis is a significant deviation from
the standard model prediction for the t \bar t differential cross section at
large invariant mass. At M_{t\bar t}>1 TeV the cross section is predicted to be
at least twice that of the SM at the Tevatron, and for M_{t\bar t}>1.5 TeV at
least three times larger than the SM at the LHC.

torsion free connection consists in the family of $2$-jets of the geodesic
symmetries. Conversely, any connection is described in terms of the geodesic
symmetries by a simple formula involving only the Lie bracket of vector fields.
We then formulate, in terms of the symmetry jet, several aspects of the theory
of affine connections and obtain geometric and intrinsic descriptions of
various related objects involving the gauge groupoid of the frame bundle. In
particular, the property of uniqueness of affine extension admits an equivalent
formulation as the property of existence and uniqueness of a certain groupoid
morphism. Moreover, affine extension may be carried out at all orders and this
allows for a description of the tensors associated to an affine connections,
namely the torsion, the curvature and their covariant derivatives of all
orders, as obstructions for the affine extension to be holonomic. In addition
this framework provides a nice interpretation for the absence of other tensors.

management (AQM) named FavorQueue that aims to improve delay transfer of short
lived TCP flows over best-effort networks. The idea is to dequeue packets that
do not belong to a flow previously enqueued first. The rationale is to mitigate
the delay induced by long-lived TCP flows over the pace of short TCP data
requests and to prevent dropped packets at the beginning of a connection and
during recovery period. Although the main target of this AQM is to accelerate
short TCP traffic, we show that FavorQueue does not only improve the
performance of short TCP traffic but also improves the performance of all TCP
traffic in terms of drop ratio and latency whatever the flow size. In
particular, we demonstrate that FavorQueue reduces the loss of a retransmitted
packet, decreases the number of dropped packets recovered by RTO and improves
the latency up to 30% compared to DropTail. Finally, we show that this scheme
remains compliant with recent TCP updates such as the increase of the initial
slow-start value.
