rates for non-smooth optimization. We give several applications of our results

a combination of our algorithm with recent work on decentralized optimization

to detect possible additional maser components and to measure a potential
velocity drift of the lines. In addition, we follow the maser and continuum
emissions to reveal significant variations in their flux density and to
determine correlation or time-lag, if any, between them. The main maser line
profile is complex and can be resolved into a number of broad features with
line widths of 30-160 km/s. A new maser component was tentatively detected in
October 2008 that is redshifted by 470 km/s w.r.t the systemic velocity of the

contradictory statements which both appear to be true can be resolved by
recognising that they are made in different perspectives. Probability, in an
objective sense, belongs in the internal perspective, and to statements in the
future tense. Such statements obey a many-valued logic, in which the truth
values are identified as probabilities.

consistent with the shrinking of the diffractive peak in elastic scattering.

is a new event generator called DIPSY which can be used to simulate complete

description of data from the Tevatron and LHC is not quite as good as for
PYTHIA, the most advanced of the general purpose event generator programs for
these processes, our results are clearly competitive, and can be expected to
improve with careful tuning. In addition, as our model is very different from
conventional multiple scattering scenaria, the DIPSY program can be used to
gain deeper insight in the soft and semi-hard processes involved both in
hadronic and heavy ion collisions.

characterized for heights up to at least 12 km above the telescope.
  This characterization is done with a method that measures differential image
displacements using several subapertures. By extending the ordinary DIMM- and
S-DIMM-methods to measure displacements at different field angles, the height
distribution of seeing can be measured. This extended method is called S-DIMM+,

measurements are compared with the Shadow Band Ranger (SHABAR), also mounted on
the SST.
  The first results of these comparisons show good correlation between the two

allows for better production potential when conditions become better. By means
of numerical examples we show that annual plants with single or multiple
reproduction periods, monocarps, evergreen perennials and polycarpic perennials

describing trade-offs between size and the number of seeds: a modelled plant
can control the distribution of not only allocated carbohydrates but also seed
size. We provide sufficient conditions for the optimality of producing the

surrounding radio galaxies at z~2. We show that the proto-cluster surrounding
MRC 1138-262 contains 14+/-2 times more H-alpha candidates than the average
field (9 sigma significance), and the z=2.35 radio galaxy 4C+10.48 is
surrounded by 12+/-2 times more emitters than the field (5 sigma), so it is
also likely to reside in a dense proto-cluster environment. We compared these
H-alpha emitters, situated in dense environments, to a control field sample
selected from 3 separate fields forming a total area of 172 arcmin^2. We
constructed and compared H-alpha and rest-frame R continuum luminosity
functions of the emitters in both environments. The star formation density is
on average 13 times greater in the proto-clusters than the field at z~2, so the
total star formation rate within the central 1.5Mpc of the proto-clusters
exceeds 3000Msun/yr. However, we found no significant difference in the shape
of the H-alpha luminosity functions, implying that environment does not
substantially affect the strength of the H-alpha line from strongly star
forming galaxies. The proto-cluster emitters are typically 0.8mag brighter in
rest-frame R continuum than field emitters, implying they are twice as massive
as their field counterparts at the same redshift. We also show the
proto-cluster galaxies have lower specific star formation rates than field
galaxies, meaning the emitters in the dense environments formed more of their
stars earlier than the field galaxies. We conclude that galaxy growth in the
early Universe was accelerated in dense environments, and that cluster galaxies
differed from field galaxies even before the cluster had fully formed.

matter effects in the evolution of atmospheric and long-baseline neutrinos

generalize the matter potential of the Standard Model by rescaling its
strength, rotating it away from the e-e sector, and rephasing it with respect
to the vacuum term. This phenomenological parametrization can be easily
translated in terms of non-standard neutrino interactions in matter. We show
that in the most general case, the strength of the potential cannot be
determined solely by atmospheric and long-baseline data. However its flavor
composition is very much constrained and the present determination of the
neutrino masses and mixing is robust under its presence. We also present an
update of the constraints arising from this analysis in the particular case in
which no potential is present in the e-mu and e-tau sectors. Finally we
quantify to what degree in this scenario it is possible to alleviate the
tension between the oscillation results for neutrinos and antineutrinos in the
MINOS experiment and show the relevance of the high energy part of the spectrum

scalar field, among other things. In this paper, because of several attractive
features of this condition, we revisit it, and show that the scalar field can
be stabilized, if the detailed balance condition is allowed to be softly
broken. Although this is done explicitly in the non-relativistic general
covariant setup of Horava-Melby-Thompson with an arbitrary coupling constant
$\lambda$, generalized lately by da Silva, it is also true in other versions of
the HL theory. With the detailed balance condition softly breaking, the number
of independent coupling constants can be still significantly reduced. It is
remarkable to note that, unlike other setups, in this da Silva generalization,
there exists a master equation for the linear perturbations of the scalar field

the infall radii for these sources. In addition, if the core magnetic field
aligns (or nearly aligns) the core rotation axis with the magnetic field before
core collapse, then the models predict the alignment (or near alignment) of the
overall pinch field structure with the bipolar outflows in these sources. We
show that if one includes the distorting effects of bipolar outflows on
magnetic fields, then in general the observational results for L1527 and

the same for B335 only if we assume the distorting effects of the bipolar

region, and low corona, active regions are surrounded by an extensive

properties of these dark moat- or canopy-like areas using \ion{Fe}{9} 17.1 nm
images and line-of-sight magnetograms from the {\it Solar Dynamics
Observatory}. The 17.1 nm canopies consist of fibrils (horizontal fields
containing EUV-absorbing chromospheric material) clumped into featherlike
structures. The dark fibrils initially form a quasiradial or vortical pattern
as the low-lying field lines fanning out from the emerging active region
connect to surrounding network and intranetwork elements of the opposite
polarity. The area occupied by the 17.1 nm fibrils expands as supergranular
convection causes the active region flux to spread into the background medium;
the outer boundary of the dark canopy stabilizes where the diffusing flux
encounters a unipolar region of the opposite sign. The dark fibrils tend to
accumulate in regions of weak longitudinal field and to become rooted in
mixed-polarity flux. To explain the latter observation, we note that the
low-lying fibrils are more likely to interact with small loops associated with
weak, opposite-polarity flux elements in close proximity, than with high loops
anchored inside strong unipolar network flux. As a result, the 17.1 nm fibrils
gradually become concentrated around the large-scale polarity inversion lines
(PILs), where most of the mixed-polarity flux is located. Systematic flux
cancellation, assisted by rotational shearing, removes the field component
transverse to the PIL and causes the fibrils to coalesce into long PIL-aligned
filaments.

mass, and the deep VLT-FORS2 spectroscopy allows us to explore the stellar
populations all the way to the outer disk-dominated regions of these galaxies.
We find that globally, in both bulges and disks, star formation ceased earliest
in the most massive systems, as a further manifestation of downsizing. However,
within many galaxies, we find an age gradient which indicates that star
formation ended first in the outermost regions. Metallicity gradients, when
detected, are always negative such that the galaxy centres are more metal-rich.
This finding fits with a picture in which star formation continued in the
central regions, with enriched material, after it had stopped in the outskirts.
Age and metallicity gradients are correlated, suggesting that large differences
in star formation history between the inner and outer parts of S0 galaxies
yield large differences in their chemical enrichment. In agreement with
previous results, we conclude that the radial variations in the stellar
populations of S0 galaxies are compatible with the hypothesis that these
galaxies are the descendants of spiral galaxies whose star formation has
ceased. With the addition of radial gradient information, we are able to show
that this shutdown of star formation occurred from the outside inward, with the
later star formation in the central regions offering a plausible mechanism for
enhancing the bulge light in these systems, as the transformation to more
bulge-dominated S0 galaxies requires.

multiquark and the chiral-symmetric quark-gluon plasma phase are obtained at
finite temperature and magnetic field. In the mixed MQ-$\mathcal{5}\phi$ phase,
the pion gradient induced by the external magnetic field is found to be a
linear response for small and moderate field strengths. Its population ratio
decreases as the density is raised and thus the multiquarks dominate the phase.
Temperature dependence of the baryon chemical potential, the free energy and
the linear pion gradient response of the multiquark phase are well approximated

its evolution toward the main sequence may be delayed. This process involves DM
concentrated in the center of the halo by gravitational drag, and no consensus

higher masses. DM can also be captured through scattering over the baryons in a
dense object, onto or very close to the Main Sequence. This mechanism can
affect formed stars and in principle prolonge their lifetimes. The strength of
both mechanisms depends upon several environmental conditions and on DM

explain these rapid climate fluctuations, and no agreement has emerged on which
may be the more correct for describing the paleoclimatic signal. In this work,
we assess the bimodality of the system reconstructing the topology of the
multi--dimensional attractor over which the climate system evolves. We use
high-resolution ice core isotope data to investigate the statistical properties
of the climate fluctuations in the period before the onset of the abrupt
change. We show that Dansgaard-Oeschger events have weak early warning signals
if the ensemble of events is considered. We find that the statistics are
consistent with the switches between two different climate equilibrium states
in response to a changing external forcing (e.g. solar, ice sheets...), either
forcing directly the transition or pacing it through stochastic resonance.
These findings are most consistent with a model that associates
Dansgaard-Oeschger with changing boundary conditions, and with the presence of
a bifurcation point.

between bodies with nontrivial electromagnetic properties, such as between a
perfect electric conductor and a perfect magnetic conductor, realistic
repulsion seems difficult to achieve. Repulsion is possible if the medium
between the bodies has a permittivity in value intermediate to those of the two
bodies, but this may not be a useful configuration. Here, inspired by recent
numerical work, we initiate analytic calculations of the Casimir-Polder
interaction between an atom with anisotropic polarizability and a plate with an
aperture. In particular, for a semi-infinite plate, and, more generally, for a
wedge, the problem is exactly solvable, and for sufficiently large anisotropy,
Casimir-Polder repulsion is indeed possible, in agreement with the previous
numerical studies. In order to achieve repulsion, what is needed is a
sufficiently sharp edge (not so very sharp, in fact) so that the directions of
polarizability of the conductor and the atom are roughly normal to each other.
The machinery for carrying out the calculation with a finite aperture is
presented. As a motivation for the quantum calculation, we carry out the
corresponding classical analysis for the force between a dipole and a metallic
sheet with a circular aperture, when the dipole is on the symmetry axis and
oriented in the same direction.

systematically by formulating a perturbative framework by taking theta_{13} as

range of theta_{13} below the Chooz limit. We show on general ground that the
correction terms must be of order epsilon^2. Yet, they nicely fill the mismatch
between the approximate and the exact formulas at low energies and relatively
long baselines. General theorems are derived which serve for better
understanding of delta-dependence of the oscillation probability. Some
interesting implications of the large theta_{13} hypothesis are discussed.

gas accretion onto a pair of well-resolved galaxy halos. Cold-flow streams and
gas-rich mergers produce a circum-galactic component of cool gas that generally
orbits with high angular momentum about the galaxy halo before falling in to
build the disk. This signature of cosmological accretion should be observable
using background-object absorption line studies as features that are offset
from the galaxy's systemic velocity by ~100 km/s. Accreted gas typically
co-rotates with the central disk in the form of a warped, extended cold flow
disk, such that the observed velocity offset is in the same direction as galaxy
rotation, appearing in sight lines that avoid the galactic poles. This
prediction provides a means to observationally distinguish accreted gas from
outflow gas: the accreted gas will show large one-sided velocity offsets in
absorption line studies while radial/bi-conical outflows will not (except
possibly in special polar projections). This rotation signature has already
been seen in studies of intermediate redshift galaxy-absorber pairs; we suggest
that these observations may be among the first to provide indirect
observational evidence for cold accretion onto galactic halos. Cold mode halo
gas typically has ~3-5 times more specific angular momentum than the dark
matter. The associated cold mode disk configurations are likely related to
extended HI/XUV disks seen around galaxies in the local universe. The fraction
of galaxies with extended cold flow disks and associated offset absorption-line
gas should decrease around bright galaxies at low redshift, as cold mode
accretion dies out.

the differences between the asteroseismic behaviour of PMS and main sequence

effective temperature range as the MS gamma Dor one. Nevertheless, the
frequency domain of unstable modes in PMS models with a fully radiative core is
larger than in MS models, even if they present the same number of unstable
modes. Moreover, the differences between MS and PMS internal structures are
reflected on the average values of the period spacing as well as on the
dependence of the period spacing on the radial order of the modes, opening the
window to the determination of the evolutionary phase of gamma Dor stars from
their pulsation spectra.

today called ""cosmic rays"", the nature of which was unknown at that time. In
his conclusive measurements in June 1911 at the Naval Academy in Livorno, and
confirmed in Bracciano a couple of months later, Pacini, proposing a novel
experimental technique, observed the radiation strength to decrease when going
from the surface to a few meters underwater (both in the sea and in the lake),
thus demonstrating that such radiation could not come from the Earth's crust.
Pacini's work was largely overlooked. Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 1936, two years after the death of Pacini, who had become a full
professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Bari. The discovery of
cosmic rays -a milestone in science- involved several scientists in Europe and
in the United States of America and took place during a period characterized by
nationalism and lack of communication. Historical, political and personal
facts, embedded in the pre- and post-World War I context, might have

scheme of Chan et al. has several advantages over other key distribution
schemes including the original scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor. However, this
offline pairwise key distribution mechanism requires that the network size be
set in advance, and involves all sensor nodes simultaneously. Here, we address
this issue by describing an implementation of the pairwise scheme that supports
the gradual deployment of sensor nodes in several consecutive phases. We
discuss the key ring size needed to maintain the secure connectivity throughout
all the deployment phases. In particular we show that the number of keys at
each sensor node can be taken to be $O(\log n)$ in order to achieve secure
connectivity (with high probability).

frozen liquid carrier (pure FF) and in a frozen lyotropic liquid crystalline
matrix in the nematic phase or ferronematic (FN) (ferrolyomesophase). Both FF
and FN phases displayed superparamagnetic (SPM) behaviour at room temperature,
with blocking temperatures T_B ~ 10 and 100 K for <d> = 2.5 and 10 nm,
respectively. Dynamic ac susceptibility measurements showed a thermally
activated N\'eel-Brown dependence of the blocking temperature with applied
frequency. Our results show that dipolar interactions are small, but
non-negligible, as compared to the single-particle energy barriers from
magnetic anisotropy. From the fit of ac susceptibility we calculated the
effective magnetic anisotropy constant K_{eff} for 2.5 nm maghemite particles.
Although interparticle interactions present in highly diluted samples do not
appreciably modify the dynamic magnetic behavior of isolated particles, the
calculated magnetic anisotropy were abut one order of magnitude larger that the
bulk materials, suggesting the existence of large surface anisotropy. Using the
thermally activated model to fit the dynamic data yielded effective energy
barriers Ea = 3.5x10^{-21} J. From these data, we obtained K_{eff} = 422 kJ/m^3

redshifts using weak lensing magnification. By stacking a significant number of
clusters at different redshifts with average masses of ~1-3x10^14M_sun, as
estimated from their richness, we can calibrate the normalisation of the
mass-richness relation. With the current data set (area: 6 deg^2) we detect a

masses estimated from the richness of the clusters and the average masses
estimated from magnification, albeit with large uncertainties. We perform tests
that suggest the absence of strong systematic effects and support the
robustness of the measurement. This method - when applied to larger data sets
in the future - will yield an accurate calibration of the mass-observable
relations at z>~1 which will represent an invaluable input for cosmological
studies using the galaxy cluster mass function and astrophysical studies of
cluster formation. Furthermore this method will probably be the least expensive
way to measure masses of large numbers of z>1 clusters detected in future

dependence, quadratic in the atom number. This is essentially due to the
dynamical self-consistent nature of the light modes assumed in our model. The
collapse of the quantum state during the photocounting process is analyzed as
well. It corresponds to the measurement-induced atom number squeezing. We show
that, at the final stage of the state collapse, the shrinking of the width of
the atom number distribution behaves exponentially in time. This is much faster
than the square root time dependence, obtained for the initial stage of the
state collapse. The exponentially fast squeezing appears due to the discrete

reported here imply that simulated low-mass galaxies (0.2<Ms/10^9 Msun <30 at
z=0) assembled their stellar masses much earlier than observations suggest.
This confirms the predictions previously found by means of LCDM-based models of
disk galaxy formation and evolution for isolated low-mass galaxies (Firmani &
Avila-Reese 2010), and highlight that our implementation of astrophysics into
simulations and models are still lacking vital ingredients.

water has a significant contribution from an inner-valence orbital. Our
experiment uses the ratio of H2O and D2O high harmonic yields to isolate the
characteristic nuclear motion of the molecular ionic states. The nuclear motion
initiated via ionization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is
small and is expected to lead to similar harmonic yields for the two isotopes.
In contrast, ionization of the second least bound orbital (HOMO-1) exhibits
itself via a strong bending motion which creates a significant isotope effect.
We elaborate on this interpretation by simulating strong field ionization and
high harmonic generation from the water isotopes using the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation. We expect that this isotope marking scheme for probing
excited ionic states in strong field processes can be generalized to other

impose holonomic constraints on their hardest degrees of freedom. In this way,
the time step used to integrate the equations of motion can be increased, thus
allowing, in principle, to reach longer total simulation times. The imposition
of such constraints results in an aditional set of Nc equations (the equations
of constraint) and unknowns (their associated Lagrange multipliers), that must
be solved in one way or another at each time step of the dynamics. In this work
it is shown that, due to the essentially linear structure of typical biological
polymers, such as nucleic acids or proteins, the algebraic equations that need
to be solved involve a matrix which is banded if the constraints are indexed in
a clever way. This allows to obtain the Lagrange multipliers through a
non-iterative procedure, which can be considered exact up to machine precision,
and which takes O(Nc) operations, instead of the usual O(Nc3) for generic
molecular systems. We develop the formalism, and describe the appropriate
indexing for a number of model molecules and also for alkanes, proteins and

the young stellar core of the galaxy expels the gas outwards from the centre of

spectra of single-component solids with pressure using various model potentials
with power law (type A) or exponential (type B) repulsive part. Based on these
data and some semi-analytical calculations our principal results may be
summarized as follows. For type A potentials: (i) The average frequency has a
power law dependence on the pressure;(ii) The normalized vibrational density of
states (NVDOS), with the average frequency as the unit of frequency, will
saturate as the pressure keeps increasing. This asymptotic NVDOS is independent
of the attractive component of the potential and hence define a universality
class; and (iii) At higher pressures the Debye frequency and the average
frequency have the same pressure dependence and this dependence is identical
for the amorphous form and the two crystalline forms studied (FCC and HCP). For
type B potentials, the above phenomenology will hold good to a good
approximation over a wide range of intermediate pressures. We suggest a scaling
form of the dispersion relations that would explain these observations. Various
aspects of the evolution of sound speed with pressure are also studied. In
particular we show that the Birch's law prescribing linear relationship between
density and sound speed will hold good at very high pressures only in
exceptional cases. We have also analyzed the data available in the literature
from laboratory experiments and {\it ab initio} calculations and find that
there is agreement with our conclusions which are derived from the study of
model potentials. We offer explanation for this agreement.

""anytime capacity"", provides the theoretical framework for studying such
problems, there has been scant practical progress in this area because explicit
constructions of tree codes with efficient encoding and decoding did not exist.
To stabilize an unstable plant driven by bounded noise over a noisy channel one
needs real-time encoding and real-time decoding and a reliability which
increases exponentially with delay, which is what tree codes guarantee. We
prove the existence of linear tree codes with high probability and, for erasure
channels, give an explicit construction with an expected encoding and decoding
complexity that is constant per time instant. We give sufficient conditions on
the rate and reliability required of the tree codes to stabilize vector plants
and argue that they are asymptotically tight. This work takes a major step

investigating the impact of the electronic \beta parameter and of curvature
effects on the nonlinear evolution of drift tearing islands. We observe a
bifurcation phenomenon that leads to an amplification of the pressure energy,
the generation of E \times B poloidal flow and a nonlinear diamagnetic drift
that affects the rotation of the magnetic island. These dynamical modifications
arise due to quasilinear effects that generate a zonal flow at the onset point
of the bifurcation. Our simulations show that the transition point is
influenced by the \beta parameter such that the pressure gradient through a
curvature effect strongly stabilizes the transition. Regarding the modified
rotation of the island, a model for the frequency is derived in order to study
its origin and the effect of the \beta parameter. It appears that after the
transition, an E \times B poloidal flow as well as a nonlinear diamagnetic
drift are generated due to an amplification of the stresses by pressure
effects.

magnetohydrodynamic model. The study reveals regimes where the linear and
nonlinear phases of the tearing instability are controlled by the properties of
the pressure gradient. In these regimes, the interplay between the pressure and
the magnetic flux determines the dynamics of the saturated state. A secondary
instability can occur and strongly modify the magnetic island dynamics by
triggering a poloidal rotation. It is shown that the complex nonlinear
interaction between the islands and turbulence is nonlocal and involves small
scales.

formation of a robust but highly variable vortex above the topography anomaly.
The vortex dynamics integrates the white noise forcing of oceanic eddies into a
red noise signal for the large scale volume transport of the vortex. The strong
interannual fluctuations of the transport of the Zapiola anticyclone ($\sim 100

detect a faint extended X-ray emission associated to the cluster. Finally, we
compare the optical and X-ray properties of ClG 0332-2747 with the predictions
of a well tested semianalytic model. We estimate the velocity dispersion and
the virial mass considering all 44 spectroscopic members, or 20 red-sequence

^{+1.57}_{-1.16}~10^{14} M_sun in the former case, and slightly lower values in
the latter case. The cluster appears to have reached the virial equilibrium: it
shows a perfectly Gaussian velocity distribution and no evidence for
substructures. ClG 0332-2747 contains a high fraction of bright red galaxies,
and is dominated by a very massive (1.1 x 10^{12} M_sun) old brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG), suggesting that it formed at an early epoch. We detect a faint
extended X-ray source centered on the BCG, with a total X-ray luminosity of L_X
~ 2 x 10^{42} erg s^-1 (0.1-2.4 keV). This L_X is lower by a factor of ~10-20
than expected according to the M-L_X relation. We provide a possible
explanation of this discrepancy as due to the effects of AGN feedback on the
ICM: the semianalytic model reproduces the M-L_X relation measured from ""X-ray
bright"" clusters, and it predicts a high scatter at low masses due to heating
and expulsion of the cluster gas. Interestingly, in the model clusters with an
evolved galaxy population like ClG 0332-2747 present the largest scatter in
X-ray luminosity.

corona and - possibly - into the solar wind (SW), can now continuously be
studied with modern telescopes and spectrometers on spacecraft, in addition to
investigations from the ground, in particular, during total eclipses. Despite
the large amount of data available on these prominent features and related
phenomena, many questions remained unanswered as to their generation and
relative contributions to the high-speed streams emanating from CHs. An
understanding of the processes of plume formation and evolution requires a
better knowledge of the physical conditions at the base of CHs, in plumes and
in the surrounding inter-plume regions (IPR). More specifically, information is
needed on the magnetic field configuration, the electron densities and
temperatures, effective ion temperatures, non-thermal motions, plume
cross-sections relative to the size of a CH, the plasma bulk speeds, as well as
any plume signatures in the SW. In spring 2007, the authors proposed a study on
""Structure and dynamics of coronal plumes and inter-plume regions in solar
coronal holes"" to the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern to
clarify some of these aspects by considering relevant observations and the
extensive literature. This review summarizes the results and conclusions of the
study. Stereoscopic observations allowed us to include three-dimensional
reconstructions of plumes. Multi-instrument investigations carried out during
several campaigns led to progress in some areas, such as plasma densities,
temperatures, plume structure and the relation to other solar phenomena, but
not all questions could be answered concerning the details of plume generation

problem, that can be solved using standard algorithms. This leads to good upper
bounds for the original problem. For our algorithms no discretization of space
and time and no simulation is necessary. Furthermore it is applicable even for
high-dimensional problems. The algorithm provides an approximation of the value
not only for one starting point, but for the complete value function on the
continuation set, so that the optimal exercise region and e.g. the Greeks can
be calculated. We apply the algorithm to (one- and) multidimensional diffusions

regimes, in which the usual EC O- and X- modes are cut-off. In this case, EBWs
seem to be the only option that can provide features similar to the EC
waves---controllable localized H&CD that can be utilized for core plasma
heating as well as for accurate plasma stabilization. The EBW is a
quasi-electrostatic wave that can be excited by mode conversion from a suitably
launched O- or X-mode; its propagation further inside the plasma is strongly
influenced by the plasma parameters. These rather awkward properties make its
application somewhat more difficult. In this paper we perform an extensive
numerical study of EBW H&CD performance in four typical ST plasmas (NSTX L- and
H-mode, MAST Upgrade, NHTX). Coupled ray-tracing (AMR) and Fokker-Planck (LUKE)
codes are employed to simulate EBWs of varying frequencies and launch
conditions, which are the fundamental EBW parameters that can be chosen and
controlled. Our results indicate that an efficient and universal EBW H&CD
system is indeed viable. In particular, power can be deposited and current
reasonably efficiently driven across the whole plasma radius. Such a system
could be controlled by a suitably chosen launching antenna vertical position
and would also be sufficiently robust.

we study different sub populations of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) -
dynamically formed systems in globular clusters (GCs) and in the nucleus of M31
and (presumably primordial) X-ray binaries in the fields of galaxies. Our aim
is to produce accurate luminosity distributions of X-ray binaries in different
environments, suitable for quantitative comparison with each other and with the
output of population synthesis calculations. Our sample includes seven nearby
galaxies (M31, Maffei 1, Centaurus A,M81, NGC 3379, NGC 4697, and NGC 4278) and
the Milky Way, which together provide relatively uniform coverage down to the
luminosity limit of E35 erg/s. In total we have detected 185 LMXBs associated
with GCs, 35 X-ray sources in the nucleus of M31, and 998 field sources of
which ~ 365 are expected to be background AGN. We combine these data, taking
special care to accurately account for X-ray and optical incompleteness
corrections and the removal of the contamination from the cosmic X-ray
background sources, to produce luminosity distributions of X-ray binaries in
different environments to far greater accuracy than has been obtained
previously. We found that luminosity distributions of GC and field LMXBs differ
throughout the entire luminosity range, the fraction of faint (log(Lx) < 37)
sources among the former being ~ 4 times less than in the field population. The
X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of sources in the nucleus of M31 is similar to
that of GC sources at the faint end but differs at the bright end, with the M31
nucleus hosting significantly fewer bright sources. We discuss the possible
origin and potential implications of these results.

group of four dwarf galaxies (DDO\,154, Ho\,II, IC\,2574 and NGC\,2366) for
which most necessary input parameters are available from observations. The
formulation of the equations takes into account the rising rotation curves
generally observed in dwarf galaxies. The inclusion of self-gravity of the gas
into the model at par with that of the stars results in scale heights that are
smaller than what was obtained by previous authors. This is important as the
gas scale height is often used for deriving other physical quantities. The
inclusion of gas self-gravity is particularly relevant in the case of dwarf
galaxies where the gas cannot be considered a minor perturbation to the mass
distribution of the stars. We find that three out of four galaxies studied show
a flaring of their {H\,{\sc i}} disks with increasing radius, by a factor of a
few within several disk scale lengths. The fourth galaxy has a thick {H\,{\sc

remaining constant or decreasing only slightly while the disk mass distribution
declines exponentially as a function of radius.

cryptographic techniques are not feasible in most sensor network architectures.
Several symmetric key distribution mechanisms are proposed for establishing
pairwise keys between sensor nodes in sensor networks, but most of them are not
scalable and also are not much suited for mobile sensor networks because they
incur much communication as well as computational overheads. Moreover, these
schemes are either vulnerable to a small number of compromised sensor nodes or
involve expensive protocols for establishing keys. In this paper, we introduce
a new scheme for establishing keys between sensor nodes with the help of
additional high-end sensor nodes, called the auxiliary nodes. Our scheme
provides unconditional security against sensor node captures and high network
connectivity. In addition, our scheme requires minimal storage requirement for
storing keys mainly due to only a single key before deployment in each node in
the sensor network, supports efficiently addition of new nodes after initial
deployment and also works for any deployment topology.

the study of several invariant overdetermined differential equations in

a given set of ranges. There are two notions of discrepancy, namely continuous
discrepancy and combinatorial discrepancy. Depending on the ranges, several
possible variants arise, for example star discrepancy, box discrepancy, and
discrepancy of half-spaces. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of these
problems with respect to the dimension d of the underlying space.
  All these problems are solvable in time {n^O(d)}, but such a time dependency
quickly becomes intractable for high-dimensional data. Thus it is interesting
to ask whether the dependency on d can be moderated.
  We answer this question negatively by proving that the canonical decision
problems are W[1]-hard with respect to the dimension. This is done via a
parameterized reduction from the Clique problem. As the parameter stays linear
in the input parameter, the results moreover imply that these problems require
{n^\Omega(d)} time, unless 3-Sat can be solved in {2^o(n)} time.
  Further, we derive that testing whether a given set is an {\epsilon}-net with
respect to half-spaces takes {n^\Omega(d)} time under the same assumption. As
intermediate results, we discover the W[1]-hardness of other well known
problems, such as determining the largest empty star inside the unit cube. For
this, we show that it is even hard to approximate within a factor of {2^n}.

quasi-static MIMO interference channels with imperfect channel knowledge. With
random Gaussian inputs, the conventional interference alignment (IA) method has
the feasibility problem when the channel is quasi-static. On the other hand,
structured lattices can create structured interference as opposed to the random
interference caused by random Gaussian symbols. The structured interference
space can be exploited to transmit the desired signals over the gaps. However,
the existing alignment methods on the lattice codes for quasi-static channels
either require infinite SNR or symmetric interference channel coefficients.
Furthermore, perfect channel state information (CSI) is required for these
alignment methods, which is difficult to achieve in practice. In this paper, we
propose a robust lattice alignment method for quasi-static MIMO interference
channels with imperfect CSI at all SNR regimes, and a two-stage decoding
algorithm to decode the desired signal from the structured interference space.
We derive the achievable data rate based on the proposed robust lattice
alignment method, where the design of the precoders, decorrelators, scaling
coefficients and interference quantization coefficients is jointly formulated
as a mixed integer and continuous optimization problem. The effect of imperfect
CSI is also accommodated in the optimization formulation, and hence the derived
solution is robust to imperfect CSI. We also design a low complex iterative
optimization algorithm for our robust lattice alignment method by using the
existing iterative IA algorithm that was designed for the conventional IA
method. Numerical results verify the advantages of the proposed robust lattice
alignment method.

morphotropic (MPB) and antiferroelectric boundaries provide new insight in some
controversial aspects of its phase diagram. No evidence is found of a border
separating monoclinic (M) from rhombohedral (R) phases, in agreement with
recent structural studies supporting a coexistence of the two phases over a
broad composition range x < 0.5, with the fraction of M increasing toward the
MPB. It is also discussed why the observed maximum of elastic compliance
appears to be due to a rotational instability of the polarisation and therefore
cannot be explained by extrinsic softening from finely twinned R phase alone,
but indicates the presence also of M phase, not necessarily homogeneous.
  A new diffuse transition is found within the ferroelectric phase near x ~
0.1, at a temperature T_IT higher than the well established boundary T_T to the
phase with tilted octahedra. It is proposed that around T_IT the octahedra
start rotating in a disordered manner and finally become ordered below T_T. In
this interpretation, the onset temperature for octahedral tilting monotonically
increases up to the antiferroelectric transition of PbZrO3, and the depression

The data reveal a non-monotonic doping dependence, similar to previous

of the parent compound reveal a non-linear Hall coefficient and a strong linear

the large in-plane resistivity anisotropy. It is suggested that the relatively
small in-plane anisotropy of the parent compound in the spin density wave state

Fermi surface. Progressive suppression of the contribution to the conductivity
arising from this isotropic pocket with chemical substitution eventually
reveals the underlying in-plane anisotropy associated with the remaining FS

origin as similar events in V4743Sgr and RSOph, as it occurred on the same time

period. High-resolution X-ray spectra are presented for 4 intervals of
different intensity. All spectra are atmospheric continua with absorption lines
and absorption edges. Interstellar lines of OI and NI are seen at their rest
wavelengths, and a large number of high-ionization absorption lines are found
at blue shifts indicating an expansion velocity of 3000-3400 km/s, which does
not change significantly during the epochs of observation. Comparisons with the

in the continua of V2491Cyg and RSOph is found. The only differences are
smaller line shifts and additional emission lines in RSOph that are related to
a dense stellar wind from the evolved companion. Three unidentified absorption

0.11, for BL Lac objects detected by EGRET and Fermi. Using the empirical

decoherence leads, as a function of time, to a decay of coherence of
superposition states. Since the interactions between system and environment are
local, they can also cause a loss of spatial coherence: correlations between
spatially distant parts of the system are lost and the equilibrium states can
become localized. This effect limits the distance over which quantum
information can be transmitted, e.g., along a spin chain. We investigate this
issue in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator, where it is possible
to monitor the spreading of quantum information in a three-dimensional network:
states that are initially localized on individual spins (qubits) spread under
the influence of a suitable Hamiltonian apparently without limits. If we add a
perturbation to this Hamiltonian, the spreading stops and the system reaches a
limiting size, which becomes smaller as the strength of the perturbation
increases. This limiting size appears to represent a dynamical equilibrium. We
present a phenomenological model to describe these results.

modulation and sum-cost minimization (JAMSCmin) problems are considered. Unlike
OFDMA, in addition to the restriction of allocating a sub-channel to one user
at most, the multiple sub-channels allocated to a user in SC-FDMA should be
consecutive as well. This renders the resource allocation problem prohibitively
difficult and the standard optimization tools (e.g., Lagrange dual approach
widely used for OFDMA, etc.) can not help towards its optimal solution. We
propose a novel optimization framework for the solution of these problems that
is inspired from the recently developed canonical duality theory. We first
formulate the optimization problems as binary-integer programming problems and
then transform these binary-integer programming problems into continuous space
canonical dual problems that are concave maximization problems. Based on the
solution of the continuous space dual problems, we derive resource allocation
(joint with adaptive modulation for JAMSCmin) algorithms for both the problems
which have polynomial complexities. We provide conditions under which the
proposed algorithms are optimal. We also propose an adaptive modulation scheme

prove that our models always converge to a stable labeling. Moreover, we

its performance with the asynchronous model both in terms of quality,
efficiency and stability. Tests show that the proposed protocol does not harm

another one generated from the poloidal field diffused at midlatitudes from the

through the harmonic oscillator and Kepler-Coloumb potentials, in order to
obtain maximally superintegrable classical systems on N-dimensional Riemannian
spaces of nonconstant curvature. By one hand, the harmonic oscillator potential
leads to two families of superintegrable systems which are interpreted as an
intrinsic Kepler-Coloumb system on a hyperbolic curved space and as the
so-called Darboux III oscillator. On the other, the Kepler-Coloumb potential
gives rise to an oscillator system on a spherical curved space as well as to
the Taub-NUT oscillator. Their integrals of motion are explicitly given. The
role of the (flat/curved) Fradkin tensor and Laplace-Runge-Lenz N-vector for
all of these Hamiltonians is highlighted throughout the paper. The
corresponding quantum maximally superintegrable systems are also presented.

masses in the MeV to multi-GeV mass range (using precision electroweak
measurements, neutrino-electron and neutrino-nucleon scattering, electron and
muon anomalous magnetic moments, upsilon decay, beam dump experiments, atomic
parity violation, low-energy neutron scattering and primordial
nucleosynthesis). We compute their implications for the three parameters that
in general describe the low-energy properties of such bosons: their mass and
their two possible types of dimensionless couplings (direct couplings to
ordinary fermions and kinetic mixing with Standard Model hypercharge). We argue
that gauge bosons with very small couplings to ordinary fermions in this mass
range are natural in string compactifications and are likely to be generic in
theories for which the gravity scale is systematically smaller than the Planck
mass - such as in extra-dimensional models - because of the necessity to
suppress proton decay. Furthermore, because its couplings are weak, in the
low-energy theory relevant to experiments at and below TeV scales the charge
gauged by the new boson can appear to be broken, both by classical effects and
by anomalies. In particular, if the new gauge charge appears to be anomalous,
anomaly cancellation does not also require the introduction of new light
fermions in the low-energy theory. Furthermore, the charge can appear to be
conserved in the low-energy theory, despite the corresponding gauge boson
having a mass. Our results reduce to those of other authors in the special
cases where there is no kinetic mixing or there is no direct coupling to
ordinary fermions, such as for recently proposed dark-matter scenarios.

the $Cos^\lamda$ and $Sin^\lambda$-transforms on the Grassmann manifolds
$Gr_p(K)=SU (n+1,K)/S (U (p,K)\times U (n+1-p,K))$ are standard intertwining
operators between certain generalized principal series representations induced
from a maximal parabolic subgroup $P_p$ of $SL (n+1,K)$. The index ${}_p$
indicates the dependence of the parabolic on p. The general results of Knapp

extension to C and are invertible for generic $\lambda\in C$. Furthermore,
known methods from representation theory combined with a Selberg type integral
allow us to determine the K-spectrum of those operators.

insight into the scaling of stagnation pressure with initial conditions of an
imploding spherical plasma shell or ""liner."" Simulations reveal the evolution
of high-Mach-number (M), annular, spherical plasma flows during convergence,
stagnation, shock formation, and disassembly, and indicate that cm- and
{\mu}s-scale plasmas with peak pressures near 1 Mbar can be generated by liners
with initial kinetic energy of several hundred kilo-joules. It is shown that
radiation transport and thermal conduction must be included to avoid
non-physical plasma temperatures at the origin which artificially limit liner
convergence and thus the peak stagnation pressure. Scalings of the stagnated
plasma lifetime ({\tau}stag) and average stagnation pressure (Pstag, the
pressure at the origin, averaged over {\tau}stag) are determined by evaluating
a wide range of liner initial conditions. For high-M flows, {\tau}stag L0/v0,
where L0 and v0 are the initial liner thickness and velocity, respectively.
Furthermore, for argon liners, Pstag scales approximately as v0^(15/4) over a
wide range of initial densities (n0), and as n0^(1/2) over a wide range of v0.
The approximate scaling Pstag ~ M 3/2 is also found for a wide range of
liner-plasma initial conditions.

resolution, hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of a Milky Way sized halo
and its environment. Our simulation includes gas cooling, star formation,
supernova feedback, metal enrichment and UV heating. In total, 90 satellites
and more than 400 isolated dwarf galaxies are formed in the simulation,
allowing a systematic study of the internal and environmental processes that
determine their evolution. We find that 95% of satellite galaxies are gas-free
at z=0, and identify three mechanisms for gas loss: supernova feedback, tidal
stripping, and photo-evaporation due to re-ionization. Gas-rich satellite
galaxies are only found with total masses above ~ 5x10^9 solar masses. In
contrast, for isolated dwarf galaxies, a total mass of ~ 10^9 solar masses
constitutes a sharp transition; less massive galaxies are predominantly
gas-free at z=0, more massive, isolated dwarf galaxies are often able to retain
their gas. In general, we find that the total mass of a dwarf galaxy is the
main factor which determines its star formation, metal enrichment, and its gas
content, but that stripping may explain the observed difference in gas content
between field dwarf galaxies and satellites with total masses close to 10^9
solar masses. We also find that a morphological transformation via tidal
stripping of infalling, luminous dwarf galaxies whose dark matter is less
concentrated than their stars, cannot explain the high total mass-light ratios
of the faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
