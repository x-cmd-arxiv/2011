well-posedness of the toy PDE $u_{t}=f(u)$ in $L^{p}$ under this no-blow-up

$\psi\in L^{2}(0,1)$ such that $\int_{1}^{\infty}1/f(s)\d s=\infty$ and the toy

spinor condensates, are natural candidates to study the interplay between
magnetism and superfluidity. In the spinor condensates made of alkali atoms
studied so far, the spinor properties are set by contact interactions, while
magnetization is dynamically frozen, due to small magnetic dipole-dipole
interactions. Here, we study the spinor properties of S=3 $^{52}$Cr atoms, in
which relatively strong dipole-dipole interactions allow changes in
magnetization. We observe a phase transition between a ferromagnetic phase and
an unpolarized phase when the magnetic field is quenched to an extremely low
value, below which interactions overwhelm the linear Zeeman effect. The BEC
magnetization changes due to magnetic dipole-dipole interactions that set the
dynamics. Our work opens up the experimental study of quantum magnetism with
free magnetization using ultra-cold atoms.

computing the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst outflow propagating in a
magnetized stellar wind using ""ab initio"" principles regarding the microphysics
of relativistic Fermi acceleration. It is shown that in magnetized
environments, one expects a drop-out in the X-ray band on sub-day scales as the
synchrotron emission of the shock heated electrons exits the frequency band. At
later times, Fermi acceleration becomes operative when the blast Lorentz factor
drops below a certain critical value, leading to the recovery of the standard
afterglow light curve. Interestingly, the observed drop-out bears resemblance
with the fast decay found in gamma-ray bursts early X-ray afterglows.

first order operators (such as the Dirac operator) on globally hyperbolic
Lorentzian spacetime manifolds have unique advanced and retarded Green's
functions and their Cauchy problem is well-posed. The space of compactly
supported Cauchy data can be equipped with a naturally induced Hermitian but
generally indefinite product, which is shown to be independent of the
underlying choice of Cauchy hypersurface.
  As a special result, we study one particular example of twisted Dirac
operator for Fermionic fields of higher spin. It allows a canonical Hermitian
product on the spinor bundle, but the resulting product on the space of
compactly supported Cauchy data fails positivity. Thus, it is shown that this
construction does not allow quantization by forming a C*-algebra representation

photon and a polariton BEC takes place after a single high-power excitation
pulse and we find both condensed states in thermal equilibrium with the excited

decrease in the long-range spatial coherence. Build-up and successive depinning

recent quantum dots experiments have shown that an electrostatic backgate could
be used to control the energy dispersion of magnetic levels. We discuss how the
generically asymmetric coupling of the metallic contacts to two different
molecular orbitals can indeed lead to a gate-tunable Hund's rule in the
presence of singlet and triplet states in the quantum dot. For gate voltages
such that the singlet constitutes the (non-magnetic) ground state, one
generally observes a suppression of low voltage transport, which can yet be
restored in the form of enhanced cotunneling features at finite bias. More
interestingly, when the gate voltage is controlled to obtain the triplet
configuration, spin S=1 Kondo anomalies appear at zero-bias, with non-Fermi
liquid features related to the underscreening of a spin larger than 1/2.
Finally, the small bare singlet-triplet splitting in our device allows to
fine-tune with the gate between these two magnetic configurations, leading to
an unscreening quantum phase transition. This transition occurs between the
non-magnetic singlet phase, where a two-stage Kondo effect occurs, and the
triplet phase, where the partially compensated (underscreened) moment is akin
to a magnetically ""ordered"" state. These observations are put theoretically
into a consistent global picture by using new Numerical Renormalization Group
simulations, taylored to capture sharp finie-voltage cotunneling features
within the Coulomb diamonds, together with complementary out-of-equilibrium
diagrammatic calculations on the two-orbital Anderson model. This work should
shed further light on the complicated puzzle still raised by multi-orbital
extensions of the classic Kondo problem.

lead to optimal multi-agent searches. Specifically, we illustrate the problem
in terms of local search algorithms for autonomous agents looking for the

nature of measurements at each agent, for which coordination among multiple

synergy and that ineffective coordination corresponds to independence as
defined using information theory. We classify explicit types of sources in

uncorrelated signals provide no opportunity for synergetic coordination while
sources that emit signals that are correlated in some way, do allow for strong
synergy between searchers. These general considerations are crucial for

few 10^4 to 10^8 M_sun have been found in various types of galaxies in
different environments. Objects with masses comparable to normal globular
clusters (GCs) are called extended clusters (ECs), while objects with masses in
the dwarf galaxy regime are called ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). In
heavily interacting galaxies star clusters tend to form in larger
conglomerations called star cluster complexes (CCs). In this work we
systematically scan a suitable parameter space for CCs and perform numerical
simulations to study their further fate. The varied sizes and masses of the CCs
cover a matrix of 5x6 values with CC Plummer radii between 10 - 160 pc and CC
masses between 10^5.5 - 10^8 M_sun, which are consistent with observed CC
parameters. The CCs of the parametric study are on orbits with distances
between 20 kpc and 60 kpc. In addition, we studied also the evolution of CCs on
a circular orbit at a distance of 60 kpc to verify that also extremely extended
ECs and UCDs can be explained by our formation scenario. All 54 simulations end
up with stable merger objects, wherein 26 to 97% of the initial CC mass is
bound. The objects show a general trend of increasing effective radii with
increasing mass. Despite the large range of input Plummer radii of the CCs (10
to 160 pc) the effective radii of the merger objects are constrained to values
between 10 and 20 pc at the low mass end and to values between 15 and 55 pc at
the high mass end. The structural parameters of the models are comparable to
those of the observed ECs and UCDs. The results of the circular orbits
demonstrate that even very extended objects like the M31 ECs found by Huxor in
2005 and the very extended (r_eff > 80 pc), high-mass UCDs can be explained by
merged cluster complexes in regions with low gravitational fields at large

the data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides.
During two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomaly
that we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. We also find
evidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry.
The recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis is
nearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the star spot would not have
remained on the transit chord. By analyzing the timings of the anomalies we
find the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be -1_{-12}^{+14} degrees. This
result is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation of
the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It suggests that the planet migration mechanism
preserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution has
realigned the system. Future applications of this method using data from the

are formed substantially by the deflection of lobe plasma flowing back from the
hot spots (backflow) and develop in two stages: supersonic expansion of an
overpressured cocoon at early times followed by buoyant expansion at later
times. We explore a limited parameter space of jet and atmosphere properties
and find that the most prominent wings are produced when a decaying jet is
injected into a small, dense, highly elliptical atmosphere. On the basis of
this search, we argue that the deflection of backflow by gradients in the hot
atmosphere is a strong candidate for forming observed wings but must work in
tandem with some other mechanism for forming the initial wing channels. Our
models indicate that lobe interaction with the hot atmosphere may play a
dominant role in shaping the morphology of radio galaxies.

Although it is known that the stalled accretion shock turns into explosion when
the neutrino luminosity from the collapsed core exceeds a critical value
(L_crit) (the ""neutrino mechanism""), the physics of L_crit, as well as its
dependence on the properties of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and changes to the
microphysics has never been systematically explored. We solve the
one-dimensional steady-state accretion problem between the PNS surface and the
accretion shock. We quantify the deep connection between the solution space of
steady-state accretion flows with bounding shocks and the neutrino mechanism.
We show that there is a maximum, critical sound speed above which it is
impossible to maintain accretion with a standoff shock, because the shock jump
conditions cannot be satisfied. The physics of this critical sound speed is
general and does not depend on a specific heating mechanism. For the simple
model of pressure-less free-fall onto a shock bounding an isothermal accretion
flow with sound speed c_T, we show that if c_T^2/v_escape^2 > 3/16 explosion
results. We generalize this result to the more complete supernova problem,
showing explicitly that the same physics determines L_crit. We find that the
critical condition for explosion can be written as c_S^2/v_escape^2 = 0.19,
where c_S is the adiabatic sound speed. This ""antesonic"" condition describes
L_crit over a broad range in accretion rate and microphysics. We show that the
addition of the accretion luminosity (L_acc) reduces L_crit non-trivially. As
in previous work, we find that L_crit is always significantly higher than the
maximum possible value of L_acc. Finally, we provide evidence that the
reduction in L_crit seen in recent multi-dimensional simulations results from a
reduction in the efficiency of cooling, rather than an increase in the heating
rate.

as compared to the optical range. To check whether these features are real, we
analysed archival mid-infrared broadband images obtained with the Spitzer Space
Telescope in the 3.6--160 $\mu$m range and compared them with the data in other
spectral domains. In the 3.6 and 5.8 $\mu$m bands we detected at $\sim$
(4--5)$\sigma$ significance level a point-like object, that is likely to be the
counterpart of the Vela pulsar. Its position coincides with the pulsar at < 0.4
arcsec 1$\sigma$-accuracy level. Combining the measured fluxes with the
available multiwavelength spectrum of the pulsar shows a steep flux increase
towards the infrared, confirming the reality of the near-infrared excess
reported early, and, hence, the reality of the suggested mid-infrared pulsar
identification. Geminga is also identified, but only at a marginal 2$\sigma$
detection level in one 3.6 $\mu$m band. This needs a farther confirmation by
deeper observations, while the estimated flux is also compatible with the
near-infrared Geminga excess. The detection of the infrared excess is in
contrast to the Crab pulsar, where it is absent, but is similar to the two
magnetars, 4U 0142+61 and 1E 2259+586, showing similar features. We discuss
X-ray irradiated fall-back discs around the pulsars, unresolved pulsar nebula
structures, and pulsar magnetospheres as possible origins of the excesses. We

We derive the conditions for RNE's uniqueness and for convergence of the
distributed algorithm; and show that the total throughput (social utility) is
less than that at NE when RNE is unique. We also show that for multiple RNEs,
the the social utility may be higher at a RNE as compared to that at the

including the spatial spread of infectious diseases, diffusion of rumors, and
emergence of consensus. These patterns however are often dominated by specific
locations and recurrent flows and poorly modeled by the random diffusive
dynamics generally used to study them. Here we develop a theoretical framework
to analyze contagion within a network of locations where individuals recall
their geographic origins. We find a phase transition between a regime in which
the contagion affects a large fraction of the system and one in which only a
small fraction is affected. This transition cannot be uncovered by continuous
deterministic models due to the stochastic features of the contagion process
and defines an invasion threshold that depends on mobility parameters,
providing guidance for controlling contagion spread by constraining mobility
processes. We recover the threshold behavior by analyzing diffusion processes
mediated by real human commuting data.

  Distribution",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most influential recent results in network analysis is that many
natural networks exhibit a power-law or log-normal degree distribution. This
has inspired numerous generative models that match this property. However, more
recent work has shown that while these generative models do have the right
degree distribution, they are not good models for real life networks due to
their differences on other important metrics like conductance. We believe this
is, in part, because many of these real-world networks have very different
joint degree distributions, i.e. the probability that a randomly selected edge
will be between nodes of degree k and l. Assortativity is a sufficient
statistic of the joint degree distribution, and it has been previously noted
that social networks tend to be assortative, while biological and technological
networks tend to be disassortative.
  We suggest understanding the relationship between network structure and the
joint degree distribution of graphs is an interesting avenue of further
research. An important tool for such studies are algorithms that can generate
random instances of graphs with the same joint degree distribution. This is the
main topic of this paper and we study the problem from both a theoretical and
practical perspective. We provide an algorithm for constructing simple graphs
from a given joint degree distribution, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method
for sampling them. We also show that the state space of simple graphs with a
fixed degree distribution is connected via end point switches. We empirically
evaluate the mixing time of this Markov Chain by using experiments based on the
autocorrelation of each edge. These experiments show that our Markov Chain
mixes quickly on real graphs, allowing for utilization of our techniques in
practice.

cosmic ray events, and spatially correlated cloud parameters could be of great

constrained. In this paper, we consider the influence of gravitational
microlensing on polarised emission from the ESR in the quadruply imaged quasar,
Q2237+0305, demonstrating how correlated features in the resultant light curve
variations can determine both the size and orientation of the scattering
region. This signal is due to differential magnification between
perpendicularly polarised views of the ESR, and is clearest for a small ESR
width and a large ESR radius. Cross- and auto-correlation measures appear to be
independent of lens image shear and convergence parameters, making it ideal to
investigate ESR features. As with many microlensing experiments, the time-scale
for variability, being of order decades to centuries, is impractically long.
However, with a polarization filter oriented appropriately with respect to the
path that the quasar takes across the caustic structure, the ESR diameter and
radius can be estimated from the auto- and cross-correlation of polarized light
curves on much shorter time-scales.

distributed routing policies. The latter are characterized by the property that
the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing
links is allowed to depend only on local information about the current particle
densities on the outgoing links. The strong resilience of the network is
defined as the infimum sum of link-wise flow capacity reductions under which
the network cannot maintain the asymptotic total inflow to the destination node
to be equal to the inflow at the origin. A class of distributed routing
policies that are locally responsive to local information is shown to yield the
maximum possible strong resilience under such local information constraints for
an acyclic dynamical flow network with a single origin-destination pair. The
maximal strong resilience achievable is shown to be equal to the minimum node
residual capacity of the network. The latter depends on the limit flow of the
unperturbed network and is defined as the minimum, among all the
non-destination nodes, of the sum, over all the links outgoing from the node,
of the differences between the maximum flow capacity and the limit flow of the
unperturbed network. We propose a simple convex optimization problem to solve
for equilibrium limit flows of the unperturbed network that minimize average
delay subject to strong resilience guarantees, and discuss the use of tolls to
induce such an equilibrium limit flow in transportation networks. Finally, we
present illustrative simulations to discuss the connection between cascaded

acquiring useful functionality as a restricted form of learning from random
examples. Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as
conjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and
hence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiant's
framework (2007). One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether
conjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant,
2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new
combinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of
learning from correlations.
  We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions
having a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable
distribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm. Our algorithm
relies on a non-linear loss function being used to select the hypotheses
instead of 0-1 loss in Valiant's (2007) original definition. The proof of
evolvability requires that the loss function satisfies several mild conditions
that are, for example, satisfied by the quadratic loss function studied in
several other works (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; Valiant, 2010). An important
property of our evolution algorithm is monotonicity, that is the algorithm
guarantees evolvability without any decreases in performance. Previously,
monotone evolvability was only shown for conjunctions with quadratic loss
(Feldman, 2009) or when the distribution on the domain is severely restricted

late-type, rotationally supported dwarfs inside Milky Way-sized host galaxies.
Our study focuses on a wide variety of dwarf orbital configurations and initial
structures. During the evolution, the disky dwarfs undergo strong mass loss,
the stellar disks are transformed into spheroids, and rotation is replaced by
random motions of the stars. Thus, the late-type progenitors are transformed
into early-type dwarfs as envisioned by the tidal stirring model for the
formation of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the Local Group. We determine
the photometric properties of the dwarfs, including the total visual magnitude,
the half-light radius and the central surface brightness as they would be
measured by an observer near the galactic center. Special emphasis is also
placed on studying their kinematics and shapes. We demonstrate that the
measured values are biased by a number of observational effects including the
increasing angle of the observation cone near the orbital pericenter, the fact
that away from the pericenter the tidal tails are typically oriented along the
line of sight, and the fact that for most of the evolution the stellar
components of the dwarfs are triaxial ellipsoids whose major axis tumbles with
respect to the line of sight. Finally, we compare the measured properties of
the simulated dwarfs to those of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. The
evolutionary tracks of the dwarfs in different parameter planes and the
correlations between their different properties, especially the total magnitude
and the surface brightness, strongly suggest that present-day dSph galaxies may
have indeed formed from late-type progenitors as proposed by the tidal stirring
scenario.

and planet properties, observational effects, and selection criteria. We
consider several different ground-based surveys and express the resulting
yields as a function of stellar mass. Selecting targets based on their youth,
visual brightness, and proximity to the Sun, we find that strong correlations
between star mass and planet properties are required to reproduce high-contrast
imaging results to date. Using the most recent empirical findings for the
occurrence rate of planets from RV surveys, our simulations indicate that
extrapolation of the Doppler planet population to separations accessible to
high-contrast instruments provides excellent agreement between simulations and
observations using present-day contrast levels. In addition to being
intrinsically young and bright to serve as their own beacon for AO correction,
A-stars have a high planet occurrence rate and propensity to form massive
planets in wide orbits, making them ideal targets. The same effects responsible
for creating a multitude of detectable planets around massive stars conspire to
reduce the number orbiting low-mass stars. However, in the case of a young
stellar cluster, MK-stars can dominate the number of detections because of an
observational bias related to small number statistics. The degree to which
low-mass stars produce the most detections in this special case depends upon
formation mechanism. [Abridged]

much research interest currently. However, little attention has been paid to
the relation between network structure and the performance of prediction
methods. In order to fill this vital gap, we try to understand how the network
structure affects the performance of link prediction methods in the view of
clustering. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that
as the clustering grows, the precision of these methods could be improved
remarkably, while for the sparse and weakly clustered network, they perform
poorly. We explain this through the distinguishment caused by increased
clustering between the score distribution of positive and negative instances.
Our finding also sheds light on the problem of how to select appropriate
approaches for different networks with various densities and clusterings.

interacting leads are then incorporated by determining the contour-ordered
Green's function over the Keldysh loop and applying Langreth's theorem. The
dot-lead interactions significantly increase the height of the Kondo peaks in
density of states of the quantum dot. This translates into two Kondo peaks in
the spin differential conductance when the magnitude of the spin bias equals
that of the Zeeman splitting. There also exists a plateau in the charge
differential conductance due to the combined effect of spin bias and the Zeeman
splitting. The low-bias conductance plateau with sharp edges is also a
characteristic of the Kondo effect. The conductance plateau disappears for the
case of asymmetric dot-lead interaction.

Earth masses embedded in a turbulent protoplanetary disk. The aim is to examine
whether or not resonant trapping can occur and be maintained in presence of
turbulence and how this depends on the amplitude of the stochastic density
fluctuations in the disk. We have performed 2D numerical simulations using a
grid-based hydrodynamical code in which turbulence is modelled as stochastic
forcing. We assume that the outermost planet is initially located just outside
the position of the 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR) with the inner one and we
study the dependance of the resonance stability with the amplitude of the
stochastic forcing. For systems of two equal-mass planets we find that in disk
models with an effective viscous stress parameter {\alpha} 10^{-3}, damping
effects due to type I migration can counteract the effects of diffusion of the
resonant angles, in such a way that the 3:2 MMR can possibly remain stable over
the disk lifetime. For systems of super-Earths with mass ratio q=m_i/m_o < 1/2,
where m_i (m_o) is the mass of the innermost (outermost) planet, the 3:2 MMR is
broken in turbulent disks with effective viscous stresses 2x10^{-4}< {\alpha}<
10^{-3} but the planets become locked in stronger p+1:p resonances, with p
increasing as the value for {\alpha} increases. For {\alpha}> 2x10^{-3}, the
evolution can eventually involve temporary capture in a 8:7 commensurability
but no stable MMR is formed. Our results suggest that for values of the viscous
stress parameter typical to those generated by MHD turbulence, MMRs between two
super-Earths are likely to be disrupted by stochastic density fluctuations. For
lower levels of turbulence however, as is the case in presence of a dead-zone,
resonant trapping can be maintained in systems with moderate values of the
planet mass ratio.

temperature cannot affect the CAM or LOD to a sufficient extent, the results
favor either a direct effect of Earth's core-generated magnetic field (e.g.,
through the modulation of charged-particle fluxes, which may impact cloud
formation) or a more indirect effect of some other core process on the
climate-or yet another process that affects both"". The main aim of the present

disc galaxies is still considered as a major problem in galaxy dynamics. It is
even discussed as an imprint of the formation history of discs and the
evolution of baryons in dark matter haloes. Here, we analyse a selected sample
of 70 galaxies from the Westerbork HI Survey of Spiral and Irregular Galaxies.
The HI data allow us to follow the morphology and the kinematics out to very
large radii. In the present paper, we present the rotation curves and study the
kinematic asymmetry. We extract the rotation curves of receding and approaching
sides separately and show that the kinematic behaviour of disc galaxies can be
classified by five different types: symmetric velocity fields where the
rotation curves of receding and approaching sides are almost identical; global
distortions where the rotation velocities of receding and approaching side have
an offset which is constant with radius; local distortions which lead to large
deviations in the inner and negligible deviations in the outer parts (and vice
versa); and distortions which split the galaxies into two kinematic systems,
visible in the different behaviour of the rotation curves of receding and
approaching sides, which leads to a crossing and a change in side. The
kinematic lopsidedness is measured from the maximum rotation velocities,
averaged over the plateau of the rotation curves. This gives a good estimate of
global lopsidedness in the outer parts of the sample galaxies. We find that the
mean value of the perturbation parameter denoting the lopsided potential as
obtained from the kinematic data is 0.056. 36% of all sample galaxies are
globally lopsided, which can be interpreted as the disc responding to a halo
that was distorted by a tidal encounter. In Paper II, we study the
morphological lopsidedness for the same sample of galaxies.

This
so-called lopsidedness is expected to significantly affect the dynamics and
evolution of the disc, including the star formation activity. Here, we measure
the degree of lopsidedness for the gas distribution in a selected sample of 70
galaxies from the Westerbork HI Survey of Spiral and Irregular Galaxies. This
complements our earlier work (Paper I) where the kinematic lopsidedness was
derived for the same galaxies. The morphological lopsidedness is measured by
performing a harmonic decomposition of the surface density maps. The amplitude
of lopsidedness A_1, the fractional value of the first Fourier component, is
typically quite high (about 0.1) within the optical disc and has a constant
phase. Thus, lopsidedness is a common feature in galaxies and indicates a
global mode. We measure A_1 out to typically one to four optical radii,
sometimes even further. This is, on average, four times larger than the
distance to which lopsidedness was measured in the past using near-IR as a
tracer for the old stellar component, and will therefore provide a new, more
stringent constraint on the mechanism for the origin of lopsidedness.
Interestingly, the value of A_1 saturates beyond the optical radius.
Furthermore, the plot of A_1 vs. radius shows fluctuations which we argue are
due to local spiral features. We also try to explain the physical origin of
this observed disc lopsidedness. No clear trend is found when the degree of
lopsidedness is compared to a measure of the isolation or interaction
probability of the sample galaxies. However, this does not rule out a tidal
origin if the lopsidedness is long-lived. Additionally, we find that the
early-type galaxies tend to be more morphologically lopsided than late-type
galaxies. Both results together indicate a tidal origin for the lopsidedness.

complete quenching of the anomalous Hall current for a certain direction of the

we endeavor to relate the overall trend of the AHC in these compounds to the
changes in their densities of d-states around the Fermi energy upon varying the

in three distinct quantum systems. Firstly, the Anderson transition is studied
for the BCC and FCC lattices. We obtain high precision results for the critical
disorder at the band centre and the critical exponent. Comparing the critical
disorder between the SC, BCC and FCC lattices, an increase is observed as a
function of the coordination number of the lattice. The critical exponent is
found to be approximately 1.5 in agreement with the value for the SC lattice.
Energy-disorder phase diagrams are plotted for both lattice types. Next, we
consider the Aharonov-Bohm effect for an exciton in a 1D ring. The aim is to
determine how the addition of a constant electric field in the plane of the
ring affects the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations. We observe an inversion of the
oscillations in the oscillator strength at a critical electric field, with the
oscillation minimum reaching zero at half a magnetic flux quantum. This
suggests a possible process for controlling the formation and recombination of
excitons through tuning the applied fields. The final section is concerned with
collective excitations of graphene in a strong perpendicular magnetic field.
The oscillator strengths and energies of collective excitations are calculated
and the good quantum numbers identified. In particular, we study those arising
from the SU(4) symmetry, which is due to two spin and two valley pseudospin
projections. This enables us to determine the multiplet structure of the
states. In addition to neutral collective excitations or excitons, we
investigate the possible formation of charged collective excitations or trions
from nearly full or nearly empty Landau levels. The localisation of neutral
collective excitations upon a single Coulomb or delta-function impurity is also
examined.

irradiance for the Holocene. Methods. We extend the SATIRE models to estimate
the evolution of the total (and partly spectral) solar irradiance over the
Holocene. The basic assumption is that the variations of the solar irradiance
are due to the evolution of the dark and bright magnetic features on the solar
surface. The evolution of the decadally averaged magnetic flux is computed from
decadal values of cosmogenic isotope concentrations recorded in natural
archives employing a series of physics-based models connecting the processes
from the modulation of the cosmic ray flux in the heliosphere to their record
in natural archives. We then compute the total solar irradiance (TSI) as a
linear combination of the jth and jth + 1 decadal values of the open magnetic
flux. Results. Reconstructions of the TSI over the Holocene, each valid for a
di_erent paleomagnetic time series, are presented. Our analysis suggests that
major sources of uncertainty in the TSI in this model are the heritage of the
uncertainty of the TSI since 1610 reconstructed from sunspot data and the
uncertainty of the evolution of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment. The
analysis of the distribution functions of the reconstructed irradiance for the
last 3000 years indicates that the estimates based on the virtual axial dipole
moment are significantly lower at earlier times than the reconstructions based
on the virtual dipole moment. Conclusions. We present the first physics-based
reconstruction of the total solar irradiance over the Holocene, which will be
of interest for studies of climate change over the last 11500 years. The
reconstruction indicates that the decadally averaged total solar irradiance
ranges over approximately 1.5 W/m2 from grand maxima to grand minima.

In
practice, to hedge a contingent claim one typically uses the so-called
delta-hedging strategy. This strategy stems from the Black--Merton--Scholes
model where it perfectly replicates contingent claims. From the theoretical
viewpoint, there is no reason for this to hold in models with jumps. However in
practice the delta-hedging strategy is widely used and its potential
shortcoming in models with jumps is disregarded since such models are typically
incomplete and hence most contingent claims are non-attainable. In this note we
investigate a complete model with jumps where the delta-hedging strategy is
well-defined for regular payoff functions and is uniquely determined via the
risk-neutral measure. In this setting we give examples of (admissible)
delta-hedging strategies with bounded discounted value processes, which
nevertheless fail to replicate the respective bounded contingent claims. This
demonstrates that the deficiency of the delta-hedging strategy in the presence
of jumps is not due to the incompleteness of the model but is inherent in the
discontinuity of the trajectories.

Kuramoto model of populations of oscillators. The synchronized solutions are
characterized by an integer $m$, the winding number, and a second integer $l$.
Synchronized solutions of type ($m$, $l=0$) are all stable, and an explicit
perturbative expression for these for large values of the coupling constant $K$
is presented. For low $K$, these solutions appear at certain specific values,
each merging with a solution of type ($m$, $l=1$), both these solutions being
stable for $K$ close to the relevant value. The ($m$, 0) solution continues to
be stable for larger $K$, while the ($m$, 1) solution, on continuation in $K$
becomes unstable and then merges with a new type (with a different $m$ and l)
of unstable solution. The ($m$,0) type solutions for large $K$ are in the
nature of phase waves traveling round the ring. All the stable synchronized
solutions are entrained by an external periodic driving, provided that the
driving frequency is sufficiently close to the frequency of the synchronized
population. A perturbative approach is outlined for the construction of the
entrained solutions. For a given amplitude of driving, there is a certain
maximum detuning between the two up to which the entrained solution persists.
The question of stability of the entrained solution is addressed. The simplest
situation involving three oscillators is investigated in details where the
onset of synchronization is seen to occur through a tangent bifurcation at some
critical value of $K$. Immediately before the appearance of the first
synchronized solution, the system exhibits intermittent chaos with a typical
scaling for the duration of the laminar phase. Under a periodic driving with an
appropriately limited detuning, there occurs entrainment of the chaotic
solution.

into shocks at the surface of a star. To model the sound waves and shocks, we
consider adiabatic non-spherical perturbations of a Newtonian perfect fluid
star. Because tidal forcing of sounds waves is naturally treated with linear
theory, but the formation of shocks is necessarily nonlinear, we consider the
perturbations in two regimes. In most of the interior, where tidal forcing
dominates, we treat the perturbations as linear, while in a thin layer near the
surface we treat them in full nonlinearity but in the approximation of plane
symmetry, fixed gravitational field and a barotropic equation of state. Using a
hodograph transformation, this nonlinear regime is also described by a linear
equation. We show that the two regimes can be matched to give rise to a single
mode equation which is linear but models nonlinearity in the outer layers. This
can then be used to obtain an estimate for the critical mode amplitude at which
a shock forms near the surface. As an application, we consider the tidal waves
raised by the companion in an irrotational binary system in circular orbit. We
find that shocks form at the same orbital separation where Roche lobe overflow
occurs, and so shock formation is unlikely to occur.

lattice antiferromagnets, which exhibit large but non-extensive ground state
degeneracies. Such models are appropriate to many A-site magnetic spinels. We
argue very generally that sufficiently dilute impurities induce an ordered
magnetic ground state, and provide a mechanism of degeneracy breaking. The
states which are selected can be determined by a ""swiss cheese model"" analysis,
which we demonstrate numerically for a particular impurity model in this case.
Moreover, we present criteria for estimating the stability of the resulting
ordered phase to a competing frozen (spin glass) one. The results may explain
the contrasting finding of frozen and ordered ground states in CoAl2O4 and
MnSc2S4, respectively.

matter at high densities but also raises the interesting question if the
neutron star PSR J1614-2230 was born massive. The answer is vital for
understanding neutron star formation in core collapse supernovae. Furthermore,
this system raises interesting issues about the nature of the progenitor binary
and how it evolved during its mass exchanging X-ray phase. In this paper we
discuss the progenitor evolution of PSR J1614-2230. We have performed detailed
stellar evolution modelling of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries undergoing Case
A Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) and applied an analytic parameterization for
calculating the outcome of either a common envelope evolution or the highly
super-Eddington isotropic re-emission mode. We find two viable possibilities
for the formation of the PSR J1614-2230 system: either it contained a 2.2-2.6
M_sun giant donor star and evolved through a common envelope and spiral-in
phase or, more likely, it descended from a close binary system with a 4.0-5.0
M_sun main sequence donor star via Case A RLO. We conclude that the neutron
star must have been born with a mass of ~1.95 M_sun or 1.7+-0.15 M_sun,
respectively - which significantly exceeds neutron star birth masses in
previously discovered radio pulsar systems. Based on the expected neutron star
birth masses from considerations of stellar evolution and explosion models, we
find that the progenitor star of PSR J1614-2230 is likely to have been more
massive than 20 M_sun.

study of the emergence of cooperation in spatially structured populations. Such
structure is usually assumed to be given by a graph. In general, the success of
cooperative strategies is associated with the possibility of forming globular
clusters, which in turn depends on a feature of the network that is measured by
its clustering coefficient. In this work we test the dependence of the success
of cooperation with the clustering coefficient of the network, for several
different families of networks. We have found that this dependence is far from
trivial. Additionally, for both stochastic and deterministic dynamics we have
also found that there is a strong dependence on the initial composition of the
population. This hints at the existence of several different mechanisms that
could promote or hinder cluster expansion. We have studied in detail some of
these mechanisms by concentrating on completely ordered networks (large
clustering coefficient) or completely random networks (vanishing clustering
coefficient).
