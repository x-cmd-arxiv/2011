by stochastic lattice models of self-driven particles. Here we focus on
bidirectional transport models excluding the exchange of particles on the same
track. We explore the possibility to have efficient transport in these systems.
One possibility would be to have appropriate interactions between the various
motors' species, so as to form lanes. However, we show that the lane formation
mechanism based on modified attachment/detachment rates as it was proposed
previously is not necessarily connected to an efficient transport state and is
suppressed when the diffusivity of unbound particles is finite. We propose
another interaction mechanism based on obstacle avoidance that allows to have
lane formation for limited diffusion. Besides, we had shown in a separate paper
that the dynamics of the lattice itself could be a key ingredient for the
efficiency of bidirectional transport. Here we show that lattice dynamics and
interactions can both contribute in a cooperative way to the efficiency of
transport. In particular, lattice dynamics can decrease the interaction
threshold beyond which lanes form. Lattice dynamics may also enhance the
transport capacity of the system even when lane formation is suppressed.

selection rules derived from the one-pion exchange mechanism. It is shown that
all the $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$ resonances appearing in the $\pi N$ scattering
data and strongly coupling to the $\pi N$ channel are identified with the
orbital configurations $(1S_{1/2})^2(nlj)$. Baryon resonances corresponding to
the orbital configuration with two valence quarks in excited states couple
strongly to the $\pi \pi N$-channel, but not to the $\pi N$ channel.
  At low energy scale up to 2000 MeV, the obtained numerical estimations for
the SU(2) baryon states (up to and including F-wave $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$
resonances) within the schematic periodic table are mostly consistent with the
experimental data.
  It is argued that due-to the overestimation of the ground state N(939) and
Roper resonance N(1440) almost by the same amount and that the Roper resonance
is a radial excitation of the N(939), the ""lowering mechanism"" for the both

illustrate some of the complexities of the general three body problem. The
total collapse or singularity that occurs when starting from one of the five
central configurations (two triangular and three collinear) generates periodic
solutions and the singularity mimics an elastic bounce. Periodic solutions
without collisions where found by Standish : three particles fall from an
initial triangle to each other and without colliding, come later to rest on
another triangle where the motion reverses. Singularities where the motion
ends, are illustrated by equal particles starting from an isosceles triangle.
The lack of continuity in neighbouring solutions is illustrated by particles
starting from a nearly equatorial triangle. Although the total energy is
negative, an elliptic-hyperbolic break up of the system where all three
particles go to infinity. is possible. Two particles are tightly bound in
elliptic motion, their CoM recedes to infinity while in an hyperbolic motion
with the third particle. The famous historic case of the Pythagorean triangle
shows that such a break up may happen after a long time and several close
passages. The break-up in a elliptic hyperbolic system occurs in a very short
time period around a very close passage. Progress in the understanding the
interactions between the particles when they are very close,can lead to sharper
escape criteria. This review suggests that for the free fall, there are only
three types of final trajectories : a) periodic with or without collisions, b)
ending in a ternary collision and c) a break-up in an elliptic-hyperbolic
system.

correlated quantum many-body systems, the self-energy functional approach (SFA)
has become increasingly important. In its previous form, however, SFA is not
applicable to Bose-Einstein condensation or superfluidity. In this paper we
show how to overcome this shortcoming. To this end we identify an appropriate
quantity, which we term $D$, that represents the correlation correction of the
condensate order parameter, as it does the self-energy for the Green's
function. An appropriate functional is derived, which is stationary at the
exact physical realizations of $D$ and of the self-energy. Its derivation is
based on a functional-integral representation of the grand potential followed
by an appropriate sequence of Legendre transformations. The approach is not
perturbative and therefore applicable to a wide range of models with local
interactions. We show that the variational cluster approach based on the
extended self-energy functional is equivalent to the ""pseudoparticle"" approach
introduced in Phys. Rev. B, 83, 134507 (2011). We present results for the
superfluid density in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, which show a

k-set agreement require surprisingly different techniques for proving the
impossibility in asynchronous systems with crash failures: Rather than
relatively simple bivalence arguments as in the impossibility proof for
consensus (= 1-set agreement) in the presence of a single crash failure, known
proofs for the impossibility of k-set agreement in systems with at least k>1
crash failures use algebraic topology or a variant of Sperner's Lemma. In this
paper, we present a generic theorem for proving the impossibility of k-set
agreement in various message passing settings, which is based on a simple
reduction to the consensus impossibility in a certain subsystem. We demonstrate
the broad applicability of our result by exploring the
possibility/impossibility border of k-set agreement in several message-passing
system models: (i) asynchronous systems with crash failures, (ii) partially
synchronous processes with (initial) crash failures, and (iii) asynchronous
systems augmented with failure detectors. In (i) and (ii), the impossibility
part is just an instantiation of our main theorem, whereas the possibility of
achieving k-set agreement in (ii) follows by generalizing the consensus
algorithm for initial crashes by Fisher, Lynch and Patterson. In (iii),
applying our technique yields the exact border for the parameter k where k-set
agreement is solvable with the failure detector class (Sigma_k,Omega_k), for
(1<= k<= n-1), of Bonnet and Raynal. Considering that Sigma_k was shown to be
necessary for solving k-set agreement, this result yields new insights on the
quest for the weakest failure detector.

(the trivial black hole solutions of the EKG system for which $\phi=0$
identically) are asymptotically stable: Small perturbations of
Schwarzschild-AdS initial data again lead to regular black holes, with the
metric on the black hole exterior approaching a Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime.
The main difficulties in the proof arise from the lack of monotonicity for the
Hawking mass and the asymptotically AdS boundary conditions, which render even
(part of) the orbital stability intricate. These issues are resolved in a
bootstrap argument on the black hole exterior, with the redshift effect and
weighted Hardy inequalities playing the fundamental role in the analysis. Both

simultaneously exploited by selecting the corresponding relays for reception

referred to as max-max relay selection (MMRS). Since for finite buffer sizes,
empty and full buffers are practically unavoidable if MMRS is employed, we
propose a hybrid relay selection (HRS) scheme, which is a combination of
conventional best relay selection (BRS) and MMRS. We analyze the outage
probabilities of MMRS and HRS and show that both schemes achieve the same
diversity gain as conventional BRS and a superior coding gain. Furthermore, our
results show that for moderate buffer sizes (e.g. 30 packets) HRS closely

non-propagating modes which dominate the near-field regime. An extensive

several length scales, and characterized by different exponents in different

and time (t) are complementary pairs (k *r) and ({\omega}t), it is only a
matter of taste which members of the pairs (k, {\omega}) or (r, t) one assumes
to depend on the relative velocity of the source and observer. Einstein chose r

biophysical cell biologists have an unique perspective in discovering the
viscous forces that cause moving particles to respond to an applied force in a
nonlinear manner. Using my experience as a biophysical cell biologist, I show
that in any space consisting of a photon gas with a temperature above absolute
zero, Doppler-shifted photons exert a velocity-dependent viscous force on
moving charged particles. This viscous force prevents charged particles from
exceeding the speed of light. Consequently, light itself prevents charged
particles from moving faster than the speed of light. This interpretation
provides a testable alternative to the interpretation provided by the Special
Theory of Relativity, which contends that particles are prevented from
exceeding the speed of light as a result of the relativity of time.

  Submitted to Proceedings of Science",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gravitational-wave (GW) recoil of merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
may influence the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. We examine
this possibility using SPH/N-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers in
which the merged BH receives a recoil kick. With our suite of over 200 merger
simulations, we identify systematic trends in the behavior of recoiling BHs.
Our main results are as follows. (1) While BHs kicked at nearly the central
escape speed (vesc) are essentially ""lost"" to the galaxy, in gas rich mergers,
BHs kicked with up to about 0.7 vesc may be confined to the central few kpc of
the galaxy. (2) The inflow of cold gas during a gas-rich major merger may cause
a rapid increase in central escape speed; in such cases recoil trajectories
will depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the change in vesc. (3)
Recoil events generally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei
(AGN) but may actually extend AGN lifetimes at lower luminosities. (4)
Recoiling AGN may be observable via kinematic offsets (v > 500 km s^-1) or
spatial offsets (R > 1 kpc) for lifetimes of up to about 10 - 100 Myr. (5)
Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to about 5 times less massive than their
stationary counterparts. These mass deficits lower the normalization of the M -
sigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter. (6)
Finally, the displacement of AGN feedback by a recoil event causes higher
central star formation rates in the merger remnant, thereby extending the
starburst phase of the merger and creating a denser, more massive stellar cusp.

upper limits of r_0 < 6-8 h^-1 Mpc at 3.7 mJy, and r_0 < 11-12 h^-1 Mpc at 4.2

that the real r_0 is likely smaller. This casts doubts on the robustness of
claims that SMGs are characterized by significantly stronger spatial
clustering, (and thus larger mass), than differently selected galaxies at
high-redshift. Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that even strongly
clustered distributions of galaxies can appear unclustered when sampled with
limited sensitivity and coarse angular resolution common to current
sub-millimeter surveys. The simulations, however, also show that unclustered
distributions can appear strongly clustered under these circumstances. From the
simulations, we predict that at our survey depth, a mapped area of two
degrees^2 is needed to reconstruct the correlation function, assuming smaller
beam sizes of future surveys (e.g. the Large Millimeter Telescope's 6"" beam
size). At present, robust measures of the clustering strength of bright SMGs

combination of the optical and infrared wavelength range permits us to firmly
identify luminous asymptotic giant branch stars, which are indicative of an
intermediate-age population in these galaxies. We consider one dwarf spheroidal
(CenA-dE1) and two dwarf elliptical (SGC1319.1-4216 and ESO269-066) galaxies
that are dominated by an old population. The most recent periods of star
formation are estimated to have taken place between ~2 and ~5 Gyr ago for
SGC1319.1-4216 and ESO269-066, and approximately 9 Gyr ago for CenA-dE1. For
ESO269-066, we find that the intermediate-age populations are significantly
more centrally concentrated than the predominantly old underlying stars. The
intermediate-age population fraction is found to be low in the target galaxies
(up to ~15% of the total population). These values could be higher by a factor
of two or three, if we consider the observational limitations and the recent
discussion about the uncertainties in theoretical models. We suggest that there
is a correlation between intermediate-age population fraction and proximity to
the dominant group galaxy, with closer dwarfs having slightly smaller such
fractions, although our sample is too small to draw firm conclusions. Even when
considering our results as lower limits, the intermediate-age population
fractions for the studied dwarfs are clearly much lower than those found in
similar dwarfs around the Milky Way, but comparable to what is seen for the

color-magnitude diagram modeling to derive the star formation histories of
these late-type dwarfs. The target objects show heterogeneous star formation
histories, with average star formation rates of 0.08 to 0.70x10^{-2} M_odot/yr.
Some of them present prolonged, global bursts of star formation (~300-500 Myr).
The studied galaxies are all metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~-1.4). We further investigate
the spatial extent of different stellar populations, finding that the young
stars show a clumpy distribution, as opposed to the smooth, broad extent of the
old ones. The actively star forming regions have sizes of ~100 pc and lifetimes
of >~100 Myr, thus suggesting a stochastic star formation mode for the target
dwarf irregular galaxies. The galaxies formed ~20% to 70% of their stars more
than ~7 Gyr ago. The studied dwarfs have average star formation rates slightly
higher than their analogues in the Local Group, but comparable to those in the
M81 group. Our preliminary sample indicates that the neutral gas content of the
target dwarfs does seem to be affected by the group environment: galaxies
within a denser region have a much lower M_HI/<SFR> than the isolated ones,
meaning that they will exhaust their gas reservoir more quickly.

the SFE of 0.4 dex, which holds over 5 orders of magnitude in the stellar
density for individual global galaxies including various types especially the

galaxies compared to the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. We argue that this new relation
points to the role of existing stars in regulating the SFE, thus encoding
better the star formation physics. Comparison with physical models of star
formation recipes shows that the extended Schmidt law can be reproduced by some
models including gas free-fall in a stellar-gravitational potential and
pressure-supported star formation. By implementing this new law into the

methods have been applied to the electronically excited states of vitamin B12
(cyanocobalamin or CNCbl). Different experimental techniques have been used to
probe the excited states of CNCbl, revealing many issues that remain poorly
understood from an electronic structure point of view. Due to its efficient
scaling with size, TD-DFT emerges as one of the most practical tools that can
be used to predict the electronic properties of these fairly complex molecules.
However, the description of excited states is strongly dependent on the type of
functional used in the calculations. In the present contribution, the choice of
a proper functional for vitamin B12 was evaluated in terms of its agreement
with both experimental results and correlated ab initio calculations. Three
different functionals, i.e. B3LYP, BP86, and LC-BLYP, were tested. In addition,
the effect of relative contributions of DFT and HF to the exchange-correlation
functional was investigated as a function of the range-separation parameter,
{\mu}. The issues related to the underestimation of charge transfer (CT)
excitation energies by TD-DFT was validated by Tozer's L diagnostic, which
measures the spatial overlap between occupied and virtual orbitals involved in
the particular excitation. The nature of low-lying excited states was also
analyzed based on a comparison of TD-DFT and ab initio results. Based on an
extensive comparision against experimental results and ab initio benchmark
calculations, the BP86 functional was found to be the most appropriate in
describing the electronic properties of CNCbl. Finally, an analysis of

light-cone limit of correlation functions of a particular type of local scalar
operators to generic non-MHV amplitudes in planar N=4 SYM theory. We consider
the natural generalization of the bosonic correlators to super-correlators of
stress-tensor multiplets and show, in a number of examples, that their
light-cone limit exactly reproduces the square of the matching
super-amplitudes. Our correlators are computed at Born level. If all of their
points form a light-like polygon, the correlator is dual to the tree-level
amplitude. If a subset of points are not on the polygon but are integrated
over, they become Lagrangian insertions generating the loop corrections to the
correlator. In this case the duality with amplitudes holds at the level of the
integrand. We build up the superspace formalism needed to formulate the duality
and present the explicit example of the n-point NMHV tree amplitude as the dual
of the lowest nilpotent level in the correlator.

after which time the source's luminosity fell by roughly two orders of
magnitude, adopting a hard X-ray spectrum more typical of CVs. Our observations
confirm 1E1339's hard CV-like spectrum, with photon index Gamma=1.3+-0.2. We
found 1E1339 to be highly variable, with a 0.5-10 keV luminosity ranging from

$H^1_0(\Omega)^n$ to $L_0^2(\Omega)$ is a problem that has been widely studied

to a ball $B$, a right inverse given by an integral operator was introduced by
Bogovskii, who also proved the continuity using the Calder\'on-Zygmund theory

Amplified-and-Forward (HDAF) protocol for the multiple-access relay channel
(MARC) with quasi static fading are evaluated using the Zheng-Tse
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). We assume that there are two users, one
half-duplex relay, and a common destination, each equipped with single antenna.
For the Rayleigh fading, the DDF protocol is well known and has been analyzed
in terms of the DMT with infinite block length. By carefully dealing with
properties specific to finite block length, we characterize the finite block
length DMT which takes into account the fact that the event of decoding error
at the relay causes the degradation in error performance when the block length
is finite. Furthermore, we consider the situation where the destination does
not have a priori knowledge of the relay decision time at which the relay
switches from listening to transmitting. By introducing a decision rejection
criterion such that the relay forwards message only when its decision is
reliable, and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) at the destination
that jointly decodes the relay decision time and the information message, our
analysis show that the optimal DMT is achievable as if there is no decoding
error at the relay and the relay decision time is known at the destination.
Therefore, infinite block length and additional overhead for communicating the
decision time are not needed for the DDF to achieve the optimal DMT. To further
improve the DMT, we propose the HDAF protocol which take advantages of both the
DDF and the Amplified-and-Forward protocols by judiciously choosing which
protocol to use. Our result shows that the HDAF protocol outperforms the
original DDF in the DMT perspective. Finally, a variant of the HDAF protocol
with lower implementation complexity without sacrificing the DMT performance is
devised.

intense research interest for many years. An efficient channel allocation
scheme can significantly reduce call-blocking and calldropping probabilities.
Another important issue is to effectively manage the power requirements for
communication. An efficient power control strategy leads to reduced power
consumption and improved signal quality. In this paper, we present a novel
integer linear program (ILP) formulation that jointly optimizes channel
allocation and power control for incoming calls, based on the
carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR). In our approach we use a hybrid channel
assignment scheme, where an incoming call is admitted only if a suitable
channel is found such that the CIR of all ongoing calls on that channel, as
well as that of the new call, will be above a specified value. Our formulation
also guarantees that the overall power requirement for the selected channel
will be minimized as much as possible and that no ongoing calls will be dropped
as a result of admitting the new call. We have run simulations on a benchmark
49 cell environment with 70 channels to investigate the effect of different
parameters such as the desired CIR. The results indicate that our approach
leads to significant improvements over existing techniques.

algorithms to improve ranking results by leveraging user click feedback. Our
contributions are three-fold. First, we use real search sessions collected in a
random exploration bucket for \emph{reliable} offline evaluation of these
algorithms, which provides an unbiased comparison across algorithms without
online bucket tests. Second, we propose a re-ranking approach to improve search
results for recency queries using user clicks. Third, our empirical comparison
of a dozen algorithms on real-life search data suggests importance of a few
algorithmic choices in these applications, including generalization across
different query-document pairs, specialization to popular queries, and
real-time adaptation of user clicks.

to appearance of a large number of quasilocalized vibrational modes (qLVMs)

symmetries of the qLVMs are presented and analyzed in detail for both ground
and excited orbital states of the NV center. We find that in the high-symmetry
($C_{3v}$) excited orbital state a pair of degenerate qLVMs becomes unstable,
and the stable excited state has lower ($C_{1h}$) symmetry. This is a direct
indication of the Jahn-Teller effect, and our studies suggest that dynamical
Jahn-Teller effect in the weak coupling regime takes place. We have also
performed a detailed comparison of our results with the available experimental
data on the vibrations involved in optical emission/absorption of the NV
centers. We have directly demonstrated that, among other modes, the qLVMs
crucially impact the optical properties of the NV centers in diamond, and
identified the most important groups of qLVMs. Our results are important for
deeper understanding of the optical properties and the orbital relaxation

erasures. We address the \emph{rebuilding ratio} problem, namely, in the case
of erasures, what is the the fraction of the remaining information that needs
to be accessed in order to rebuild \emph{exactly} the lost information? It is
clear that when the number of erasures equals the maximum number of erasures
that an MDS code can correct then the rebuilding ratio is 1 (access all the
remaining information). However, the interesting (and more practical) case is
when the number of erasures is smaller than the erasure correcting capability
of the code. For example, consider an MDS code that can correct two erasures:
What is the smallest amount of information that one needs to access in order to
correct a single erasure? Previous work showed that the rebuilding ratio is
bounded between 1/2 and 3/4, however, the exact value was left as an open
problem. In this paper, we solve this open problem and prove that for the case
of a single erasure with a 2-erasure correcting code, the rebuilding ratio is
1/2. In general, we construct a new family of $r$-erasure correcting MDS array
codes that has optimal rebuilding ratio of $\frac{1}{r}$ in the case of a

constraints. Although there are variety of methods for solving such problems,
most statisticians find constrained estimation challenging. The current paper
proposes a new path following algorithm for quadratic programming based on
exact penalization. Similar penalties arise in $l_1$ regularization in model
selection. Classical penalty methods solve a sequence of unconstrained problems
that put greater and greater stress on meeting the constraints. In the limit as
the penalty constant tends to $\infty$, one recovers the constrained solution.
In the exact penalty method, squared penalties are replaced by absolute value
penalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty
constant. The exact path following method starts at the unconstrained solution
and follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the
process, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various
constraints. Path following in lasso penalized regression, in contrast, starts
with a large value of the penalty constant and works its way downward. In both
settings, inspection of the entire solution path is revealing. Just as with the
lasso and generalized lasso, it is possible to plot the effective degrees of
freedom along the solution path. For a strictly convex quadratic program, the
exact penalty algorithm can be framed entirely in terms of the sweep operator
of regression analysis. A few well chosen examples illustrate the mechanics and
potential of path following.

dissipative master equation approach that describes a cavity weakly coupled to
an ensemble of emitters. We obtain evidence that reabsorption of photons

limiting effect for the cavity mediated light enhancement under conditions of

databases that the multidimensional database organization is less scalable than
the relational one. It is easy to see that the size of the multidimensional
organization may increase very quickly. For example, if we introduce one
additional dimension, then the total number of possible cells will be at least
doubled. However, this reasoning does not takethe fact into account that the
multidimensional organization can be compressed. There are compression
techniques, which can remove all or at least a part of the empty cells from the
multidimensional organization, while maintaining a good retrieval performance.
Relational databases often use B-tree indices to speed up the access to given
rows of tables. It can be proven, under some reasonable assumptions, that the
total size of the table and the B-tree index is bigger than a compressed
multidimensional representation. This implies that the compressed array results
in a smaller database and faster access at the same time. This paper compares
several compression techniques and shows when we should and should not apply
compressed arrays instead of relational tables.

is uniquely determined by its neighbourhood within the identifying code. If
$\M(G)$ denotes the minimum size of an identifying code of a graph $G$, it was
conjectured by F. Foucaud, R. Klasing, A. Kosowski and A. Raspaud that there
exists a constant $c$ such that if a connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and
maximum degree $d$ admits an identifying code, then $\M(G)\leq
n-\tfrac{n}{d}+c$. We use probabilistic tools to show that for any $d\geq 3$,
$\M(G)\leq n-\tfrac{n}{\Theta(d)}$ holds for a large class of graphs
containing, among others, all regular graphs and all graphs of bounded clique
number. This settles the conjecture (up to constants) for these classes of
graphs. In the general case, we prove $\M(G)\leq n-\tfrac{n}{\Theta(d^{3})}$.
In a second part, we prove that in any graph $G$ of minimum degree $\delta$ and
girth at least 5, $\M(G)\leq(1+o_\delta(1))\tfrac{3\log\delta}{2\delta}n$.
Using the former result, we give sharp estimates for the size of the minimum
identifying code of random $d$-regular graphs, which is about $\tfrac{\log
d}{d}n$.

R^n)$, called Hardy spaces of Musielak-Orlicz type, which generalize the
Hardy-Orlicz spaces of Janson and the weighted Hardy spaces of Garc\'ia-Cuerva,
Str\""omberg, and Torchinsky. Here, $\varphi: \mathbb R^n\times [0,\infty)\to
[0,\infty)$ is a function such that $\varphi(x,\cdot)$ is an Orlicz function
and $\varphi(\cdot,t)$ is a Muckenhoupt $A_\infty$ weight. A function $f$
belongs to $H^{\varphi(\cdot,\cdot)}(\mathbb R^n)$ if and only if its maximal
function $f^*$ is so that $x\mapsto \varphi(x,|f^*(x)|)$ is integrable. Such a
space arises naturally for instance in the description of the product of
functions in $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$ and $BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ respectively (see
\cite{BGK}). We characterize these spaces via the grand maximal function and
establish their atomic decomposition. We characterize also their dual spaces.
The class of pointwise multipliers for $BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ characterized by
Nakai and Yabuta can be seen as the dual of $L^1(\mathbb R^n)+ H^{\rm
log}(\mathbb R^n)$ where $ H^{\rm log}(\mathbb R^n)$ is the Hardy space of
Musielak-Orlicz type related to the Musielak-Orlicz function
$\theta(x,t)=\displaystyle\frac{t}{\log(e+|x|)+ \log(e+t)}$. Furthermore, under
additional assumption on $\varphi(\cdot,\cdot)$ we prove that if $T$ is a
sublinear operator and maps all atoms into uniformly bounded elements of a
quasi-Banach space $\mathcal B$, then $T$ uniquely extends to a bounded
sublinear operator from $H^{\varphi(\cdot,\cdot)}(\mathbb R^n)$ to $\mathcal
B$. These results are new even for the classical Hardy-Orlicz spaces on
$\mathbb R^n$.

the increasing scale of the trust alliance, costs of validation grow so quickly

employs two intelligent designs, lightweight tag replacement and a hierarchical
partitioning scheme, each of which helps to ensure that SafeZone can construct
trustworthy and hierarchical trust alliances without the negative influences
and complex operations on de facto networks. Extensive experiments also
indicate that SafeZone can effectively obtain the design goals of a

production sites of heavy elements and as stirring agents and energy providers
through stellar winds and supernovae. The field of magnetic massive stars has
seen tremendous progress in recent years. Different perspectives -- ranging
from direct field measurements over dynamo theory and stellar evolution to
colliding winds and the stellar environment -- fruitfully combine into a most
interesting and still evolving overall picture, which we attempt to review
here. Zeeman signatures leave no doubt that at least some O- and early B-type
stars have a surface magnetic field. Indirect evidence, especially non-thermal
radio emission from colliding winds, suggests many more. The emerging picture
for massive stars shows similarities with results from intermediate mass stars,
for which much more data are available. Observations are often compatible with
a dipole or low order multi-pole field of about 1 kG (O-stars) or 300 G to 30
kG (Ap / Bp stars). Weak and unordered fields have been detected in the O-star
zeta-Ori A and in Vega, the first normal A-type star with a magnetic field.
Theory offers essentially two explanations for the origin of the observed
surface fields: fossil fields, particularly for strong and ordered fields, or
different dynamo mechanisms, preferentially for less ordered fields. Numerical
simulations yield the first concrete stable (fossil) field configuration, but
give contradictory results as to whether dynamo action in the radiative
envelope of massive main sequence stars is possible. Internal magnetic fields,
which may not even show up at the stellar surface, affect stellar evolution as
they lead to a more uniform rotation, with more slowly rotating cores and
faster surface rotation. Surface metallicities may become enhanced, thus
affecting the mass-loss rates.

CMMI is developed by Software Engineering Institute (SEI). CMMI is a framework
for improvement and assessment of a software development process. CMMI needs a
measurement program that is practical. The method we used to define the

local-duality (LD) version of dispersive sum rules. To probe the precision of
this theoretical approach, we adopt potential models with interactions that
involve both Coulomb and confining terms. In this case, the exact form factor
may be obtained from the solution of the Schroedinger equation and confronted
with the LD sum rule results. We use parameter values appropriate for hadron
physics and observe that, independently of the details of the confining
interaction, the deviation of the LD form factor from the exact form factor
culminates in the region Q^2~4-6 GeV^2. For larger Q^2, the accuracy of the LD
description increases rather fast with Q^2. A similar picture is expected for
QCD. For the pion form factor, existing data suggest that the LD limit may be
reached already at the relatively low values Q^2=4-10 GeV^2. Thus, large
deviations of the pion form factor from the behaviour predicted by LD QCD sum
rules for higher values of Q^2, as found by some recent analyses, appear to us
quite improbable. New accurate data on the pion form factor at Q^2=4-10 GeV^2
expected soon from JLab will have important implications for the behaviour of
the pion form factor in a broad Q^2 range up to asymptotically large values of
Q^2.

recently draws great interests. However, all existing works only studied this
problem under deterministic communication channels and required certain perfect
information to carry out their proposed algorithms. In this paper, we study
this problem for stochastic parallel Gaussian interference channels. In
particular, we take into account the randomness of the communication
environment and the estimation errors of the desired information, and thus
formulate a stochastic noncooperative power control game. We then propose a
stochastic distributed learning algorithm SDLA-I to help communication pairs
learn the Nash equilibrium. A careful convergence analysis on SDLA-I is
provided based on stochastic approximation theory and projected dynamic systems
approach. We further propose another learning algorithm SDLA-II by including a
simple iterate averaging idea into SDLA-I to improve algorithmic convergence
performance. Numerical results are also presented to demonstrate the
performance of our algorithms and theoretical results.

time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). TDDFT is then applied to the
calculation of total cross sections for ionization processes in the
antiproton-Helium collision system. The Kohn-Sham potential is approximated as
the sum of the Hartree-exchange potential and a correlation potential that was
proposed in the context of laser-induced ionization. Furthermore, some
approaches to the problem of calculating the ionization probabilities from the
density are discussed. Small projectile energies below 5keV are considered as
well as those in the range from 5 to 1000 keV. Results are compared with former
calculations and with experimental data. We find that the correlation potential
yields no obvious improvement of the results over the exchange-only
approximation where the correlation potential is neglected. Furthermore, we
find the problem of calculating the desired observables crucial, introducing
errors of at least the same order of magnitude as the correlation potential.
For the case of small energies we find that trajectory effects play an
important role: the ionization cross sections are enlarged significantly if
curved instead of straight-line trajectories are used for the projectile
motion.

well-established and a lot of studies to reveal the pattern-recalling process
have been done from various different approaches. As well-known, a single
neuron is itself an uncertain, noisy unit with a finite unnegligible error in
the input-output relation. To model the situation artificially, a kind of 'heat
bath' that surrounds neurons is introduced. The heat bath, which is a source of
noise, is specified by the 'temperature'. Several studies concerning the
pattern-recalling processes of the Hopfield model governed by the
Glauber-dynamics at finite temperature were already reported. However, we might
extend the 'thermal noise' to the quantum-mechanical variant. In this paper, in
terms of the stochastic process of quantum-mechanical Markov chain Monte Carlo
method (the quantum MCMC), we analytically derive macroscopically deterministic
equations of order parameters such as 'overlap' in a quantum-mechanical variant
of the Hopfield neural networks (let us call ""quantum Hopfield model"" or
""quantum Hopfield networks""). For the case in which non-extensive number $p$ of
patterns are embedded via asymmetric Hebbian connections, namely, $p/N \to 0$
for the number of neuron $N \to \infty$ ('far from saturation'), we evaluate
the recalling processes for one of the built-in patterns under the influence of
quantum-mechanical noise.
